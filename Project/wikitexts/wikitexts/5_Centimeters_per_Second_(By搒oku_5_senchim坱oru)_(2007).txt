It theatrically premiered in March 2007. The film consists of three segments: \"[[#Episode 1: Cherry Blossom|Cherry Blossom]]\", \"[[#Episode 2: Cosmonaut|Cosmonaut]]\", and \"[[#Episode 3: 5 Centimeters per Second|5 Centimeters per Second]]\", each following a period in Takaki T\u014dno's life and his relationships with the girls around him.\n\nThe film was awarded Best Animated Feature Film at the 2007 [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. It received a [[novelization]] in November 2007, and a manga adaption illustrated by Seike Yukiko in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nThe story is set in [[Japan]], beginning in the early 1990s up until the present day (2008),{{Efn|As shown on Takaki's whiteboard (48:50), Risa's message (52:44) and the magazine (55:30)}} with each act centered on a boy named Takaki T\u014dno.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Test of Love: 5 Centimeters Per Second|url=http://jpninfo.com/27702|publisher=Japan Info|access-date=7 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Episode 1: Cherry Blossom===\nIn 1991, Takaki T\u014dno quickly befriends Akari Shinohara after she transfers to his elementary school in [[Tokyo]]. They grow very close to each other due to similar interests and attitudes such as both preferring to stay inside during recess due to their seasonal allergies. Takaki and Akari begin to refer to each other using their given names without honorifics, which is an indicator of close friendship and intimacy in Japanese culture.\n[[File:5cm-01-02.JPG|thumb|left|The room in Iwafune Station]]\nRight after graduating from elementary school in 1994, Akari moves to the nearby prefecture of [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] due to her parents' jobs. The two keep in contact by writing letters but eventually begin to drift apart. When Takaki learns that his family will be moving to [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] on the other side of the country the following year in 1995, he decides to personally go see Akari one last time since they will be too far apart to see and visit each other once he moves. He also writes a letter for Akari to confess his feelings for her. However, Takaki loses the letter during the journey and a severe snowstorm delays his train for several hours. When the two finally meet late that night and share their first kiss, Takaki realizes they will never be together. They find a shed to spend the night in due to the severe snowstorm and fall asleep after talking late into the night. Takaki departs from the train station the next morning and the two promise to continue writing to each other. As the train rolls away, Takaki decides that the loss of his letter is not important anymore after the kiss while Akari silently looks at her own letter addressed to Takaki which she decided not to give him.\n\n===Episode 2: Cosmonaut===\n[[File:Tanegasimachuo High school.jpg|thumb|The high school in Tanegashima]]\nIn 1999, Takaki is now in the third year of [[Education in Japan#School Levels|senior high]] in [[Tanegashima]], where the [[Tanegashima Space Center]] is located. Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has loved him ever since first meeting him in middle school but has never had the courage to confess her feelings to him. She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant of Kanae's feelings and only treats her as a good friend. Kanae observes that Takaki is always writing emails to someone and staring off into the distance as if searching for something far away. It is later shown that Takaki's emails are not being sent to anyone, and he, in fact, deletes them after he finishes writing them. He also has recurring dreams which feature Akari. After a failed attempt to tell Takaki she loves him, Kanae realizes he is looking for something far beyond what she can offer and decides not to say anything, though she believes she will always love him. With such thoughts, she cries herself to sleep.\n\n===Episode 3: 5 Centimeters per Second===\nIt is now 2008 and Takaki is a programmer in Tokyo. Meanwhile, Akari is preparing to marry another man. Takaki still longs for Akari to the detriment of his lifestyle. He receives a call from his current girlfriend but does not answer which signifies the end of the relationship. Depressed, Takaki quits his job as he is unable to cope with his feelings for Akari. Akari goes through a box of her old possessions and finds the letter she had written for Takaki thirteen years ago in 1995. Takaki finds himself in a convenience store reading a magazine about the decade long journey of the rocket launched in the 2nd act. Takaki and Akari begin a dual narration where they both recall a recent dream. In the dream they relive their last meeting in the snow-filled [[Iwafune Station|Iwafune]] and remember the wish to someday watch the [[cherry blossom]]s together again.\n[[File:\u79d2\u901f5\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The train crossing in Tokyo]]\nLater, while walking down the same road they knew when they were children, Takaki and Akari appear to pass and recognize each other at the train crossing. It's the same place they had promised to watch the cherry blossoms together thirteen years ago, just before Akari moved to Tochigi. On opposite sides of the tracks, they stop and begin to look back, yet a passing train cuts off their view. Takaki waits for the train to pass and finds that Akari is gone. After a moment, he smiles to himself and continues walking as the cherry blossoms stir in the train's wake.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Takaki T\u014dno|Takaki Tono}}|\u9060\u91ce \u8cb4\u6a39|T\u014dno Takaki}}\n:{{Anime voices|[[Kenji Mizuhashi]]|[[David Matranga]]<ref name=\"Theron\"/> ([[ADV Films]] release) and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] ([[Bang Zoom!

He and Akari become close friends, but when Akari moves away, they end up attending different junior high schools. In the second arc, he is shown to be an apt [[ky\u016bd\u014d]] practitioner and a member of his school's ky\u016bd\u014d club.\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Akari Shinohara}}|\u7be0\u539f \u660e\u91cc|Shinohara Akari}}\n:{{Anime voices|Yoshimi Kond\u014d (Act 1) and Ayaka Onouei (Act 3)|[[Hilary Haag]]<ref name=\"Theron\"/> (ADV), Erika Weinstein (Act 1, Bang Zoom!) and [[Tara Platt]] (Act 3, Bang Zoom!) }}\n:Takaki's best friend and love interest in elementary school. Like Takaki, she and her family move a lot. After elementary school, she moves to [[Iwafune, Tochigi|Iwafune]]. She suggests living with her aunt in Tokyo in order to stay with Takaki, but her parents forbid this. For a while, she and Takaki keep in touch via post.\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kanae Sumida}}|\u6f84\u7530 \u82b1\u82d7|Sumida Kanae}}\n:{{Anime voices|[[Satomi Hanamura]]|[[Serena Varghese]]<ref name=\"Theron\"/> (ADV) and [[Kira Buckland]] (Bang Zoom!) }}\n:A classmate of Takaki in junior high school and high school. She has been in love with Takaki since he began attending her junior high school, but cannot express her feelings to him. Kanae loves to surf and rides a moped to school. She doesn't know what she wants to do with her future. Her older sister is a teacher at her high school. In the manga, she is seen working as a nurse after the events depicted in the film.\n\n==Production==\nMakoto Shinkai had expressed that, unlike his past works, there would be no fantasy or science fiction elements in this film. Instead, the feature film would attempt to present the real world from a different perspective. Shinkai's film gives a realistic view of the struggles many people have to face: time, space, people, and love. The title ''5 Centimeters per Second'' comes from the speed at which [[cherry blossoms]] petals fall, petals being a metaphorical representation of humans, reminiscent of the slowness of life and how people often start together but slowly drift into their separate ways.<ref name=\"Directornotes\">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://5cm.yahoo.co.jp/director/index.html|title=Director's notes|publisher=Yahoo Japan|language=ja|access-date=16 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717185827/http://5cm.yahoo.co.jp/director/index.html |archive-date=17 July 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The movie marks the first time Shinkai has worked closely with a full staff of animators and artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/?q=node/33121|title=AICN Anime \u2013 Latest From Anime Auteur Makoto Shinkai Picked Up For North America|first=Scott|last=Green|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Staff===\n*Director, Writer and Original Creator: [[Makoto Shinkai]]<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936424.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Five Centimeters Per Second|date=6 March 2008|first=Ronnie|last=Scheib|work=Variety|access-date=13 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310232641/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936424.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|archive-date=10 March 2008 }}</ref>\n*Character Design and Chief Animation Director: Takayo Nishimura<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n*Background Art: Takumi Tanji, Ryoko Majima<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n*Music: [[Tenmon (composer)|Tenmon]]<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n*Production and Distribution: [[CoMix Wave Films|CoMix Wave, Inc]].<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\n==Music==\nAs in Shinkai's previous works, [[Tenmon (composer)|Tenmon]] composed this film's soundtrack.

The ending, which is where this work differs most from Shinkai's previous efforts, will doubtless be controversial and may leave some fans unsatisfied, as it opens itself to multiple interpretations. Some may feel as if it just ends without resolving anything, but if one considers Takaki's few lines of narration in part two, how that part ends, and how everything fits together, it becomes clearer that actually resolving things was never the point. Whereas ''[[Voices of a Distant Star|Voices]]'' was about trying to maintain a connection and ''[[The Place Promised in Our Early Days|Place Promised]]'' was about reestablishing one, ''Five Centimeters'' is ultimately about moving on from past connections instead of just living in the past, about finding a way to become happy in the present rather than just pining for what has been lost over time.
