The film is shot in China and set during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The film stars [[Michelle Yeoh]], who plays an assassin who tries to return to a normal life after being counseled by a monk. After saving her husband and herself from robbers, she attracts the attention of her former assassin gang.\n\nThe film began production on October 30 and was shot in China and Taiwan. While shooting, John Woo was on set continually advising director Su Chao-pin, which led to Woo being credited as a co-director. On September 3, 2010, ''Reign of Assassins'' had its premiere at the 67th annual [[Venice Film Festival]], where it met acclaim from critics. It premiered in China on September 28, 2010, and was purchased by [[The Weinstein Company]] for North American release rights and by [[Lionsgate]] for United Kingdom release rights.\n\n==Plot==\nA narration tells of a legendary Indian [[Bhikku|Buddhist monk]], [[Bodhidharma|Bodhi]] and the belief that his mummified remains has mystical powers.\n\nThe Dark Stone gang, having found that half of the remains are in the Prime Minister Zhang's hands, sends assassins to kill him and his son Renfeng. Dark Stone's top assassin, Drizzle steals the remains and flees. She encounters the monk, Wisdom after dispatching a pursuing Renfeng at the top of a bridge. Wisdom is revealed to be an accomplished martial artist who demonstrates to Drizzle that her swordsmanship has four fatal flaws. Warning that she can be killed by a master, he attempts to persuade her to turn a new leaf and leave the life of an assassin. The three months of their association ends with him dying by her hands, a final demonstration intended to enlighten her. After Wisdom's death, Drizzle is burdened with sorrow and guilt and decides to leave her old way of life. She goes to a famous surgeon who changes her appearance and she assumes the identity of Zeng Jing, a common cloth merchant. She attracts the attention of the messenger Ah-sheng, whom she eventually marries. The Dark Stone gang's leader, Wheel King, recruits and trains a new assassin, Turquoise, a merciless girl who murdered her fianc\u00e9 and in-laws on her wedding night.\n\nThe Dark Stone gang are still in pursuit of Drizzle and the mummified remains, and one of their top members (Fatty Chen) is mysteriously assassinated.\n\nLater, Zeng Jing and Ah-sheng are in the bank when robbers enter. As the gang draws their swords, Zeng Jing defeats them and saves both her and her husband's lives. This act reveals her whereabouts to Dark Stone. The Wheel King summons three assassins in his gang \u2013 Lei Bin, the Magician, and Turquoise \u2013 to hunt Drizzle down. They locate Drizzle despite her changed appearance. However, Drizzle (now as Zeng) states that she just wants to live a normal life, and the Wheel King promises her freedom for Ah-sheng and herself in exchange for the half of the remains she took and help in collecting the other half. After the gang secure the remains, Drizzle hands over her half. The gang refuses to release her, and despite infighting that kills the Magician, she comes home wounded and collapses before Ah-sheng. Lei Bin and Turquoise follow her but are stopped by Ah-sheng, who surprises them by producing a pair of Cen-Ci swords.  Lei Bin recognizes them as Renfeng's weapons. The two assassins are defeated and Ah-sheng takes Drizzle to the surgeon, who treats Drizzle's wounds and tells Renfeng that everything is pre-destined. Flashbacks reveal that Ah-sheng's true identify is Renfeng, who did not die from Drizzle's sword because he has [[situs inversus]]. He has also changed his appearance so that he can avenge his father's death. Drizzle finds out the truth and asks Renfeng if he has ever loved her. An emotional Renfeng tells her that is impossible because of what she and Dark Stone have done to his family, but he cannot bring himself to kill her and tells her to leave.\n\nThe Wheel King, having obtained the remains, attempts to use the power to restore his bodily \"defect\"; he was castrated as a boy and uses the cover of being a low ranking [[eunuch]] to hide his criminal activities. Turquoise discovers this as she seduces him, and mocks him in anger and disappointment. The Wheel King is infuriated and buries her alive under a bridge. He sees the fireworks signal released by Drizzle, who has decided to engage him in a final battle. The Wheel King comes to a graveyard and finds Renfeng dead. Drizzle then battles him and wounds him fatally, using what Wisdom had taught her. Renfeng revives the next morning, since he was just given tortoise powder by Drizzle to appear lifeless so he could witness Drizzle avenge his family with her life. He approaches her body to touch her and finds her still alive. Renfeng is overcome with joy and carries her in his arms. Drizzle whispers to him \"After we get home, draw up the divorce papers.\" Renfeng laughs and tells her they have a long life ahead, together.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main ===\n\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Zeng Jing, Ah-sheng's wife and a cloth merchant who's revealed to be Drizzle.\n* [[Jung Woo-sung]] as Jiang Ah-sheng, Zeng Jing's husband and a courier who's revealed to be Zhang Renfeng.\n\n=== Dark Stone Gang ===\n\n* [[Wang Xueqi]] as The Wheel King / Cao Feng, Chief of the Dark Stone gang. \n* [[Barbie Shu]] as Turquoise / Ye Zhanqing, an assassin of the Dark Stone gang trained to replace Drizzle. \n* [[Shawn Yue]] as Lei Bin, an assassin of the Dark Stone gang.\n* [[Jiang Yiyan]] as Tian Qingtong, Lei Bin's wife.\n* [[Kelly Lin]] as Drizzle / Xi Yu, an assassin of the Dark Stone gang who disappears.\n* [[Leon Dai]] as the Magician / Lian Sheng, an assassin of the Dark Stone gang.\n* Ma Shuliang as Fatty Chen, a bookkeeper of the Dark Stone gang.\n\n=== Others ===\n\n* Guo Xiaodong as Zhang Renfeng, son of Prime Minister Zhang.\n* [[Paw Hee-ching]] as Granny Cai, Zeng Jing and Jiang Ah-sheng's landlord and friend.\n* [[Chin Shih-chieh]] as Doctor Li, a renowned face-changing surgeon who assists Zeng Jing and Ah-sheng.\n* [[Matt Wu]] as Killer Bear / Sha Ren Xiong.\n* Angeles Woo as Eater Bear / Chi Ren Xiong.\n* Hu Xiaoguang as leader of Song Yang 5, a group of martial artists who robbed United Bank in search of the Bodhi's remains..\n* Han Zhi as member of Song Yang 5.\n* Xing Hanqing as member of Song Yang 5.\n* Che Kim-fai as member of Song Yang 5.\n* Shi Zhanjie as member of Song Yang 5.\n* Lee Hing-cheung as Prime Minister Zhang Haiduan, Renfeng's father.\n* You Liping as Zhang Dajing, the owner of United Bank.\n* Qin Weidong as Butcher Zhu, a local butcher and matchmaking candidate for Zeng Jing.\n* Yuan Zhi Dong as Kongdong Sect's Purple Sword / Zi Jian.\n* Li Jun as Old Seven / Huang Qi.\n* You Ben Chang as Monk Jian Chi, Wisdom's mentor.\n* Wang Da Shun as Shen Bu.\n* Chen Ji as Demon Granny / Gui Po.\n* Qi Yi Ming as Demon Grandson / Gui Sun.\n* Lei Min Min as Teahouse waiter.\n* Tong Lei as Eunuch Cao / Cao gonggong.\n* [[Peter Kam]] as General Huang.\n\n=== Special Appearances ===\n\n* [[Pace Wu]] as Kongdong Sect's Teal Sword / Qing Jian.\n* [[Calvin Li]] as Wisdom / Lu Zhu, Drizzle's first love.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe idea for making ''Reign of Assassins'' came about when producer [[Terence Chang]] was looking for an action film to star [[Michelle Yeoh]].
