The ending credits stated the real FBI did not support the film or assist the production in any way.\n\n==Plot==\nEllie DeWitt is a [[U.S. Marine]] veteran who wants to become an [[FBI|FBI Agent]]. However, while she has great physical skills, she struggles at the academic level. Conversely, her roommate Janis Zuckerman is highly intelligent, but physically very weak. Overcoming the male recruits' assumptions of them, Ellie and Janis team up to help each other through the basic training so they can both become federal agents.\n\nDuring their training, Ellie and Janis must deal with an instructor who seems determined to fail the pair, a fellow trainee who seems more interested in flirting with Ellie (until Ellie asserts her Marine training and pins him against the wall in one exercise), and befriend a geeky co-trainee who seems unable to complete the smallest task.\n\nJoining forces, the three tackle the final practice simulation, (badly) forging the instructor's signature ('he sneezed') and breaking into the telephone room to discover the location of the \"hostage\". They also use their radio to mislead the other agents into a swamp to make sure they don't find the hostage first.\n\nThe two graduate with honors and in the credits scene, both Ellie and Janis are assigned as partners to the Los Angeles office.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Elizabeth 'Ellie' De Witt\n* [[Mary Gross]] as Janis Zuckerman\n* [[Ken Marshall]] as Brent Shepard\n* [[Fred Dalton Thompson]] as FBI Agent Bill Bilecki\n* [[Larry Cedar]] as Howard Butz\n* Raymond Singer as George Hupperman\n* [[James Luisi]] as FBI Agent Sperry\n* [[Jon Cedar]] as FBI Senior Agent\n* Rex Ryon as Parker\n* Norman Bernard as Bickerstaff\n* Bradley Weissman as Graham\n* [[Don Stark]] as Willy\n* David Sherrill as Duane\n* Michael Chieffo as Louie\n* [[Geoffrey Thorne]] as College Jock #3\n* Lee Arnone as Female Marine\n* [[Rick Avery]] as Bank Robber #3\n* [[Tony Longo]] as Sailor\n\n== Production ==\n[[Daniel Goldberg (producer)|Dan Goldberg]] and [[Len Blum]], the screenwriters behind ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' and ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', originally planned to make a film about \"the daffy, goofy sex-crazed guys at the FBI academy.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Wilmington |first=Michael |date=October 31, 1988 |title=Movie Reviews : Awkward \u2018Feds\u2019 Fails but Not De Mornay and Gross |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-10-31-ca-393-story.html |access-date=April 25, 2022}}</ref> When they couldn't get stars of previous [[Ivan Reitman]] films like [[Bill Murray]] or [[Dan Aykroyd]] to sign on, the pair switched the story mid-script to a female-focused film.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Kempley |first=Rita |date=October 29, 1988 |title='Feds' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/fedspg13kempley_a0c9df.htm |access-date=April 25, 2022 |website=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\n''Feds'' was made during a cycle of American cop comedies that came out after the box-office success of ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984).
