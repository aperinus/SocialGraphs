The members of the Spanish film crew unexpectedly find themselves in a moral crisis when they and their crew arrive at [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]], during the intensifying [[Cochabamba Water War]] in 2000, in which their key indigenous actor Daniel ([[Juan Carlos Aduviri]]) persistently leads.\n\nShot in Bolivia, it is an internationally co-produced film by companies from Spain, Mexico and France.\n\nThe film received nominations and won awards internationally, including an [[Ariel Award]] for Best [[Ibero-American]] Film and three [[Goya Awards]], one of which was Best Original Score for the work of [[Alberto Iglesias]]. Additionally, the film was nominated as Spain's entry for the 2011 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMexican filmmaker Sebasti\u00e1n ([[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]]) and his Spanish executive producer Costa ([[Luis Tosar]]) arrive in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]], accompanied by the cast and crew, prepared to create a historical film depicting [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the [[New World]], the imposition of Spanish authority over the natives, and the subsequent indigenous rebellion by [[Hatuey]]. Cognizant of his limited budget, Costa decides to film in [[Bolivia]], the poorest country in [[South America]]. Hundreds of Bolivian locals show up and wait in long lines in response to the open casting pamphlet. Costa is enthusiastic to save thousands of dollars by having underpaid extras perform tasks on set meant to be completed by experienced engineers.<ref name=Ebert>{{cite news |title= Even the Rain  | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110224/REVIEWS/110229991 | date=2011-02-24 | access-date=2011-11-15 | work= Chicago Sun Times | publisher= rogerebert.suntimes.com}}</ref>\n\nSebasti\u00e1n casts a local man named Daniel ([[Juan Carlos Aduviri]]) in the role of [[Hatuey]], the [[Ta\u00edno]] chief who led a rebellion against Columbus. Daniel's daughter Bel\u00e9n lands a crucial role in the film as well. Their first encounter with Daniel is during the casting process. When casting directors start to turn people away in line, Daniel starts to make a scene and states that everyone should get a chance to audition, as the pamphlet advertised. The first encounter with Daniel makes Costa oppose his casting, but Sebastian sees Daniel's fire and liveliness even in the line protesting for a chance for his daughter as perfect for the role. He is just the character they're looking for. Sebasti\u00e1n is unaware that Daniel is leading demonstrations against new [[Bolivian government|government]]-protected water company during [[Water privatization in Bolivia|water privatization]] plan. Filming begins smoothly despite the alcoholism of the actor Anton ([[Karra Elejalde]]), cast as Columbus, but when Costa observes Daniel's revolutionary involvement, he becomes increasingly uneasy about his reliability as Daniel has a critical role in the film.<ref name=\"Holden\" />\n\nA conflict that occurred between Costa and Daniel early in the film was when Daniel heard Costa express how they were getting away with paying the native extras so poorly. Costa decides to speak badly of the natives right in front of Daniel in English not knowing that Daniel understands English as well. Because of this Daniel becomes more aware of how Costa and the rest of the crew are taking advantage of the natives. After seeing that Daniel understands that abuse, Costa becomes more cognizant of it himself and starts to feel guilty, which ultimately leads to the rapid development of his character throughout the remainder of the film.\n\nAs the crew begins to wrap up the film, the exasperation of the natives intensifies. They begin to consider fighting for their rights to water by creating a riot and protesting in the streets. All these efforts are led by none other than Daniel, who despite being asked to lay low and even paid for his cooperation to film the movie smoothly, continues to protest. Costa reaches his breaking point with Daniel when after going to a protest he gets beaten by the police. He decides to try to bribe Daniel to stop going, offering him several thousand dollars to stay silent for a few weeks. Daniel agrees, accepting the money, but spends it on funding the protesters and remains involved, eventually becoming bloodied and imprisoned. Sebasti\u00e1n experiences moral conflict and begins to doubt the likelihood of the film's completion, but is reassured by Costa, who bribes the police for Daniel's temporary release to film a key scene, in which Col\u00f3n and his conquistadors execute Hatuey and his rebels. Upon this scene's completion, the police arrive in the Bolivian jungle and detain Daniel again, but are besieged by the film's extras which allows Daniel to escape.\n\nThat night, when actors Juan and Alberto see the latest news reports showing violence in Cochabamba, they become so worried that they demand to leave. Sebasti\u00e1n begs them to stay and they agree begrudgingly. The next day, as the cast and crew prepare to depart for filming, Costa is met by Daniel's wife, Teresa, who desperately implores him to assist her in finding her daughter Bel\u00e9n, who has disappeared into the protests and is reportedly wounded and needing hospitalization. Despite Costa trying to turn her down he is eventually won over by Teresa's persistence, and despite Sebasti\u00e1n's equally impassioned insistence against it, he leaves with her.\n\nRiding through the streets of Cochabamba, Costa sees the damage done to the streets and the city itself, finally realizing the seriousness of the situation that he and his crew have just stumbled upon.\n\nAfter Costa and Teresa's obstacle-laden drive through riotous Cochabamba, Bel\u00e9n's life is saved, but her leg is badly injured and may never fully heal. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew is stopped by a military blockade and all except Ant\u00f3n leave Sebasti\u00e1n to journey home. The revolution ends shortly thereafter with the departure of the multinational water company, but Cochabamba is left in ruins from the conflict. Costa expresses hope that the film will be finished after all, and Daniel emotionally presents him with a vial of Bolivian water in appreciation for saving his daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Luis

saying, 'No extras were underpaid in the making of this film.'\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer [[Stephen Holden]] also raises this concern, asserting, \"You can't help but

Shot in Bolivia, in the Chapare jungle, and in the city of Cochabamba, the film is a large production with more than 4,000 extras in total, with about 300 of the extras being indigenous people, as well as a team of 130 people and more than 70 locations, almost all of them outdoors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2010/09/28/actualidad/1285624804_850215.html| access-date=5 December 2021|title='Tambi\u00e9n la lluvia', a los Oscar|work= El Pais|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Fact and Fiction==\n{{Tone|section|date=February 2022}}\nEven the Rain is a movie within a movie. It follows the production of a period film about the myth of Christopher Columbus, whom few paint as he really was: a man obsessed with gold, a slave hunter, and a repressor of ethnic groups. The story's context is based on real events in the year [[2000]], when the population of one of the poorest nations in South America rose up against a powerful American company, [[Bechtel]], and recovered a basic good: water.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://cuadrivio.net/doble-conquista-cine-la-guerra-agua-bolivia/ |title= \u00bfDoble conquista?

The scale of the protest was such that Bechtel eventually abandoned the Bolivian market, the water contract was canceled, and a new company was installed under public control. In 2005, half of the 60,000 people in [[Cochabamba]] were still without water and the rest only received intermittent service (some for as little as three hours a day). The film portrays the lasting impacts of colonialism on native people on multiple levels, as well as the continuation of colonialism in today's society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://waterandsociety.leadr.msu.edu/water-films/tambien-la-lluvia-even-the-rain/film-analysis-by-ian-hyslop/|title=Film Analysis by Ian Hyslop \u2013 Water and Society}}</ref> In many ways, the film can refer back to the deep historical roots about resistance against colonialism.
