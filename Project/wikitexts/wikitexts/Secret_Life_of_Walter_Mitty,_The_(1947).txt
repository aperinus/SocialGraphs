The film stars [[Danny Kaye]] as a young daydreaming proofreader (later associate editor) for a magazine publishing firm and [[Virginia Mayo]] as the girl of his dreams. The film was [[screenwriter|adapted]] for the screen by Ken Englund, Everett Freeman, and Philip Rapp (uncredited), and directed by [[Norman Z. McLeod]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Walter Mitty]] (Kaye) is an \"inconsequential guy from [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]]\".<ref>{{Citation | title = The Secret Life of Walter Mitty | newspaper = Variety | date = Dec 31, 1946 | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794719?refcatid=31 | access-date = 2011-07-07 }}</ref> He is henpecked and harassed by everyone in his life including his bossy mother, his overbearing, idea-stealing boss Bruce Pierce, his dimwitted fianc\u00e9e Gertrude Griswold, Gertrude's obnoxious would-be [[suitor]] Tubby Wadsworth, Gertrude's poodle Queenie and her loud-mouthed mother, Mrs. Griswold.\n\nWalter's escape from their incessant needling is to imagine all sorts of exciting and impossible lives for himself, fueled by the [[pulp magazines]] he reads every day as an [[editing|editor]] at the Pierce Publishing Company. But his dreams only seem to land him in more trouble. In one scene, while stoking the heating boiler, he dreams what it would be like to be an [[RAF]] [[fighter pilot]]. He is awakened from this daydream by his mother, who orders him to come to dinner. Believing he is still a British fighter pilot, he salutes, and places a red-hot poker under his arm\u2014only to burn a hole in his suit jacket.\n\nThings become much more complicated when he runs into a mysterious woman, Rosalind van Hoorn (Mayo), who just happens to perfectly resemble the girl of his dreams. Rosalind is working with her uncle, Peter van Hoorn, to help secure some Dutch crown jewels hidden from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. Caught up in a real-life adventure that seems unbelievable even to him, Walter attempts to hide his [[double life]] from his mundane family and friends. Eventually, he acquires the courage to stand up to those who kick him around.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Danny Kaye]] as [[Walter Mitty]]\n* [[Virginia Mayo]] as Rosalind van Hoorn\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Dr. Hollingshead\n* [[Fay Bainter]] as Mrs. Eunice Mitty\n* [[Thurston Hall]] as Bruce Pierce\n* [[Ann Rutherford]] as Gertrude Griswald\n* [[Gordon Jones (actor)|Gordon Jones]] as Tubby Wadsworth\n* [[Florence Bates]] as Mrs. Griswald  \n* [[Konstantin Shayne]] as Peter van Hoorn  \n* [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]] as Colonel  \n* [[Henry Corden]] as Hendrick  \n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Mrs. Leticia Follinsbee \n* [[Fritz Feld]] as Anatole  \n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Maasdam  \n* [[Milton Parsons]] as The Butler\n* [[Ethan Laidlaw]] as Helmsman (uncredited)\n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as Doorman (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Trowbridge]] as Dr. Renshaw (uncredited)\n* The [[Goldwyn Girls]]\n\n==Production==\nKen Englund and Everett Freeman reportedly began work adapting James Thurber's story in January 1945. According to Thurber, producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] rejected the Englund and Freeman script in December 1945, and sent Englund to consult with Thurber, who worked with him for ten days. Thurber later complained that at one time the psychiatrist scene contained \"a bathing girl incident which will haunt me all the days of my life.\" He was repeatedly consulted by Goldwyn, but his suggestions were largely ignored. In a letter to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, Thurber expressed his considerable dissatisfaction with the script, even as Goldwyn insisted in another letter that Thurber approved of it.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web\n  | title = Notes for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947)\n  | work = TCM Movie Database\n  | publisher = Turner Classic Movies\n  | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=89426&category=Notes\n  | access-date = 2008-03-02}}</ref> Thurber also mentioned that Goldwyn asked him not to read part of the script, because it was \"too blood and thirsty.\" Thurber said that he read the entire script anyway, and was \"horror and struck\".\n\nIn moving away from Thurber's material, Goldwyn instead had the writers customize the film to showcase Kaye's talents, altering the original story so much that Thurber called the film \"The Public Life of Danny Kaye\".<ref name=\"Fensch\">{{cite book\n  | last = Fensch\n  | first = Thomas\n  | author-link = Thomas Fensch\n  | title = The Man Who Was Walter Mitty: The Life and Work of James Thurber \n  | publisher = New Century Books\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = New York\n  | pages = 267\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0k9h8Mi0nfYC\n  | isbn = 0-930751-13-2 }}</ref>\n\nGoldwyn also briefly changed the film's title to ''I Wake Up Dreaming'' in response to a [[Gallup poll]] he had commissioned, a title that was actually a [[word play]] on the 1941 [[Steve Fisher (writer)|Steve Fisher]] novel ''I Wake  Up Screaming'' (and the [[I Wake Up Screaming|1941 film of the same name]]). However, Goldwyn soon changed it back to Thurber's title in response to the angry protests of Thurber fans, as reported in a May 1947 article in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"TCM\"/>\n\nThe film includes many of Kaye's trademark [[patter-song]]s and one of his best-remembered dream characters, \"Anatole of Paris,\" a fey women's [[Hatmaking|milliner]] whose inspiration for the ridiculous chapeaux he creates is in actuality his loathing of women. The Anatole character is based on \"Antoine de Paris,\" a women's hair-salon professional of the era, known for creating preposterous hairstyles. The lyrics to the song ''Anatole of Paris'' were written by Kaye's wife, [[Sylvia Fine]].\n\n==Reception==\n''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' ranks 479th on ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.<ref>[https://www.empireonline.com/500/4.asp Empireonline.com]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations to other media==\n''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' was dramatized as a half-hour [[radio play]] on the November 3, 1947 broadcast of ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' with Kaye and Mayo in their original film roles.\n\n==Remake==\n{{Main|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)}}\nPlans to remake ''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' arose in the early 1990s, with producer [[Samuel Goldwyn Jr.]] considering actor [[Jim Carrey]] for the starring role.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117882116 | title = Paramount giddy over 'Mitty' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2003-03-11 | access-date = 2009-07-16}}</ref> After development that spanned over two decades, the film finally came to fruition with [[Ben Stiller]] as the lead actor and the director.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/20/ben-stiller-direct-walter-mitty | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Henry | last=Barnes | title=Ben Stiller to direct and star in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty | date=2011-07-20}}</ref> The film was released in the US on December 25, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty.3/ |title=The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) - Overview - MSN Movies |publisher=Movies.msn.com |date=2013-04-18 |access-date=2013-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318014521/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty.3/ |archive-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1947]]\n* [[Boris Karloff filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0039808}}\n* {{Amg title|43467}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|89426}}\n\n{{Norman Z.
