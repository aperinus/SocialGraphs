It stars [[Sean Connery]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and includes [[Will Patton]], [[Ving Rhames]] and [[Maury Chaykin]]. The film focuses on the relationship between [[Insurance Investigator|investigator]] Virginia \"Gin\" Baker and professional thief Robert \"Mac\" MacDougal as they attempt a heist at the turn of the [[New Millennium]]. [[Simon West]] and [[Antoine Fuqua]] were both in talks to direct before Amiel was hired.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/1997/film/news/fuqua-to-helm-connery-in-entrapment-for-fox-1116678181/|title= Fuqua to helm Connery in 'Entrapment' for Fox|date= May 22, 1997|access-date= April 4, 2022|first= Chris|last= Petrikin|work= Variety}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/1998/film/news/fuqua-escapes-entrapment-1117468545/|title= Fuqua escapes 'Entrapment'|date= March 8, 1998|access-date= April 4, 2022|first= Chris|last= Petrikin|work= Variety}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the [[United States]] on 30 April 1999 and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 2 July 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nVirginia \"Gin\" Baker ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]) is an [[Insurance Investigations|investigator]] for \"Waverly Insurance\". Robert \"Mac\" MacDougal ([[Sean Connery]]) is a professional thief who specialises in international art. A priceless [[Rembrandt]] painting is stolen from an office building in New York one night, and Gin is sent undercover to investigate Mac as the chief suspect. She tries to entrap him with a proposition, claiming that she is a professional thief herself, and promises that she will help him steal a priceless [[China|Chinese]] [[mask]] from the well-guarded Bedford Palace. Before agreeing, Mac tells Gin his \"Rule Number One\": \"Never carry a gun: You carry a gun, you may be tempted to use it.\" They travel to [[Scotland]] and plan the very complicated theft at Mac's hideout, an isolated [[castle]]. Aaron Thibadeaux ([[Ving Rhames]]), apparently the only ally that Mac trusts, arrives with supplies for the heist. While Mac is busy making final preparations, Gin contacts her boss, Hector Cruz ([[Will Patton]]), from a payphone, and informs him of Mac's whereabouts. Little does she know that the whole island is bugged, allowing Mac to eavesdrop on their conversation.  Mac also makes sure to keep Gin's romantic advances at bay, unsure if she is a true partner in crime or an ambitious career woman on a mission.\n\nAfter they have stolen the mask, Mac accuses Gin of planning to sell the mask to a buyer in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and then turn him in. Gin convinces him that her insurance agency job is the real cover and that she has planned an even bigger heist in Kuala Lumpur: $8 billion from the \"International Clearance Bank\" (which refers to the [[Bank of International Settlements]] in Malaysia) in the North Tower of the [[Petronas Towers]]. During their set-up, Cruz and his team (with the guidance of the stealthy Thibadeaux) track down Gin and confirm that she is still on mission to bring in Mac.\n\nDespite the presence of Cruz and other [[Royal Malaysian Police|security]] watching the building, the theft takes place in the final seconds of the new 2000 millennium countdown. Gin pulls the plug on her laptop prematurely and sets off alarms. They narrowly escape from the computer vault and are forced to cross the lights hung from the bottom of the bridge linking the two towers. Following a death-defying moment when the cable breaks, Gin and Mac make their way to a ventilation shaft, where Mac explains \"Plan B\". Using mini-[[parachute]]s, they were going to escape down the shaft. Gin had lost her parachute earlier in the escape, so Mac gives her his. He tells her to meet him the next morning at [[Pudu LRT station|Pudu train station]].\n\nGin arrives at the [[Sri Petaling Line|station]] waiting for Mac. He shows up late with Aaron Thibadeaux, who reveals himself with fellow FBI agents. He explains that Cruz is here and that the FBI has been looking for her for some time. Two years earlier, when Agent Thibadeaux caught and arrested him, Mac made a deal to help the FBI arrest Gin, as she was the primary target all along. However, the ageing thief has another plan: to help her escape. Mac slips Gin a gun, new passport and travel documents and quietly explains that he returned only seven of the eight billion dollars they had stolen electronically in the heist. Gin then pretends to hold Mac hostage at gunpoint, threatening to shoot him if the agents follow her. She boards a [[Sri Petaling Line|train]] and the FBI heads to the next station. Gin jumps trains mid-station and arrives back at Pudu. She tells Mac that she needs him for another job and they both board a train.\n[[Image:Malaysia KL 1.JPG|thumb|The Petronas Twin Towers, where the final heist takes place]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Robert \"Mac\" MacDougal\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Virginia \"Gin\" Baker\n* [[Will Patton]] as Hector Cruz\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as FBI Agent Aaron Thibadeaux\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Conrad Greene\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as Haas\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as Quinn\n* [[Madhav Sharma]] as Security Chief\n* [[David Yip]] as Chief of Police\n* [[Tim Potter]] as \"Millennium Man\"\n* [[Rolf Saxon]] as Director\n* [[Maya Karin]] (Cameo)\n\n==Filming locations==\n[[Image:TyDuartCastle20030825r20f02.jpg|thumb|Duart Castle, the location of MacDougal's hideout]]\nPrincipal Photography took place from June 29 to October 1998.

The music video features Seal performing a heist in a tall building, where he steals a talisman but sets off the alarm. As the police storm the building, Seal ultimately escapes by jumping through a window. At first, he appears to be [[free fall|free-falling]], but a [[Rock-climbing equipment#Rappel devices (descenders)|descender]] he is attached to (the same one Gin uses in the film) stops him before he reaches the ground. Seal unclips himself and walks away. The music video contains clips from the film, including Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Seal's accomplices.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a [[box office]] success, grossing over $87 million in the US and $212 million worldwide.\n\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 39% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10.

The plot is put together like a Swiss watch that keeps changing time zones: It is accurate and misleading at once. The film consists of one elaborate caper sequence after another, and it rivals the Bond films in its climactic action sequence. The stunt and f/x work here does a good job... Most of the movie's action is just that\u2014action\u2014and not extreme violence.\" Ebert noted about Zeta-Jones, \"I can only reflect, as I did while watching her in \"The Mask Of Zorro,\" that while beautiful women are a dime a dozen in the movies, those with fire, flash and humor are a good deal more scarce.\"<ref name=\"ebert review\" />\n\n\"There's a tummy-churning tradition of pensionable movie blokes getting paired up with beautiful babes...\" complained ''[[OK!]]'' in its review. \"We barely believed Sean and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in ''[[The Russia House (film)|The Russia House]]''; a decade later, Sean and ''Catherine Zeta-Jones?''

Mahathir took issue with the film splicing images of the Petronas Twin Towers with slums from Malacca. The Malaysian Government had assisted Twentieth Century Fox with visa processing, customs clearance, telecommunications and security in a bid to promote Malaysia as a film location.<ref>{{cite news |title=Entertainment Entrapment rapped by Malaysian PM |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/375244.stm |access-date=31 August 2020 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=22 June 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217101445/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/375244.stm |archive-date=17 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0137494|Entrapment}}\n* {{AllMovie title|177521|Entrapment}}\n* {{Mojo title|entrapment|Entrapment}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|entrapment|Entrapment}}\n* {{TCMDb title|id=328962|title=Entrapment}}\n\n{{Jon Amiel}}\n{{Portalbar|Film|United States|Germany|1990s|Malaysia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Entrapment (Film)}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:British crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:British heist films]]\n[[Category:Burglary in film]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Fiction featuring the turn of the third millennium]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jon Amiel]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christopher Young]]\n[[Category:Films set around New Year]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kuala Lumpur]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Argyll and Bute]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Buckinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Highland (council area)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kuala Lumpur]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Malacca]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ronald Bass]]\n[[Category:German crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:German heist films]]\n[[Category:Malay-language films]]\n[[Category:Regency Enterprises films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
