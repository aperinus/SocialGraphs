Despite not being produced by Pixar, the film was co-written and executive produced by Pixar and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' then-chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who directed the first two ''Cars'' films. The film stars the voices of [[Dane Cook]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Priyanka Chopra]] in her Hollywood debut, [[Brad Garrett]], [[Teri Hatcher]], Danny Mann, [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Roger Craig Smith]], [[John Cleese]], [[Carlos Alazraqui]], [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]], [[Val Kilmer]], and [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]].

His dreams are scorned by his boss, Leadbottom, and his [[Forklift truck|forklift]]/mechanic friend, Dottie. However, he is supported by his fuel truck friend, Chug. Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Around the Globe Rally. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly navy war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well, but Skipper declines. Dusty qualifies for the race on a [[legal technicality]], as one of the planes was disqualified for [[doping in sport|illegal fuel intake]].\n\nSkipper decides to mentor Dusty, and discovers Dusty has a [[acrophobia|fear of heights]]. With training complete, Dusty travels to [[New York City]] to start the race. There, he befriends a Mexican racer named El [[Chupacabra]], who falls in love with a French-Canadian racer named Rochelle, who shows no interest in him. Three-time defending champion Ripslinger rudely dismisses Dusty. Dusty falls in love with an Indian plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to [[Iceland]], Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place.\n\nDuring the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, [[De_Havilland_DH.88_Comet|Bulldog]], from crashing, winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again. After the third leg of the race to [[Agra]] in [[India]], Ishani invites Dusty to fly around the [[Taj Mahal]] and advises him to fly low through the [[Himalayas]] by following some railroad tracks. After flying through a tunnel (and narrowly missing a train), Dusty is in first place at [[Upper Mustang]] in [[Nepal]], but he is upset to discover that Ishani deliberately gave him bad advice (implied to be under orders from Ripslinger) in exchange for a new propeller, and he shuns her.\n\nThe fifth leg is over [[the Hump]] (the mountains between northeast India and south China) to [[Shanghai]], where Dusty gets into first place again. There, Dusty manages to help El Chupacabra win over Rochelle with a romantic song, which works a little too well. \n\nIn the sixth leg of the race across the Pacific, Ripslinger, refusing to lose to a crop duster, has his teammates and henchmen Ned and Zed clip off Dusty's navigation antenna. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty comes across the USS ''Dwight D. Flysenhower'', which allows him to land and refuel. On the carrier, Dusty discovers that Skipper only flew one war mission, which contradicts his reputation.\n\nContinuing the race, Dusty crashes into the ocean but is rescued. Severely damaged, he is flown to [[Mexico]]. Skipper confesses that his one mission leading a squadron of new fighters turned tragic. Skipper was the only survivor, but couldn't bring himself to fly again. Dusty considers dropping out of the race but is encouraged to continue by his fellow competitors, who donate parts to repair the damage he sustained. Ishani also gives Dusty her new propeller, reconciling their friendship.\n\nRacing back to New York, Ripslinger plots to finish off Dusty, but he is thwarted by Skipper. Dusty conquers his fear of heights when he rides a [[jetstream]]. Nearing the finish line, Ripslinger slows for the cameras, which allows Dusty to pass him and win, and Ripslinger crashes into [[portable toilet]]s. Dusty is congratulated by his friends, and Skipper thanks him for giving him the confidence to fly again. Skipper rejoins the navy, flying one last time with Dusty.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster plane who hopes to complete Wings Around the Globe.<ref name=\"DaneCook\">{{cite web|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=Dane Cook to voice lead in Disney's 'Planes'|url=http://family-room.ew.com/2013/02/28/dane-cook-disney-planes/|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dane Cook Leads the Voice Cast for Disney's Planes|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=100955|access-date=June 18, 2013|newspaper=ComingSoon.net|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref> He was inspired by the [[Air Tractor AT-502]], [[Cessna 188]] and the [[PZL-Mielec M-18 Dromader]].<ref name=\"SKStills\">{{cite news|title=Disney's \"Planes\" Hi-res Stills, Fun Facts and Activity Sheets|url=http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-stills-fun-facts-activity-sheets-62551/|access-date=May 11, 2013|newspaper=Stitch Kingdom|date=May 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630145040/http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-stills-fun-facts-activity-sheets-62551/|archive-date=June 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Skipper Riley, a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Chance Vought F4U Corsair]] and Dusty's mentor (who appeared in the ''[[Cars Toons]]'' episode \"Air Mater\").<ref name=\"USAPeek\" />\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as Ishani, a Pan-Asian champion from India,<ref>{{cite news|title=Priyanka Chopra lends voice for Hollywood animated film Planes|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Hollywood/Priyanka-Chopra-lends-voice-for-Hollywood-animated-film-Planes/Article1-1025634.aspx|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=March 13, 2013|access-date=March 13, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314100101/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Hollywood/Priyanka-Chopra-lends-voice-for-Hollywood-animated-film-Planes/Article1-1025634.aspx|archive-date=March 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> based on the [[AeroCad AeroCanard]]<ref name=\"CNNBautista\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/02/travel/disney-planes-film-bautista/index.html |title=Meet the pilot who kept Disney's film 'Planes' flying right |publisher=CNN.com |date= August 2, 2013|access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>\n* Danny Mann as Sparky, a forklift (who appeared in the ''Cars Toons'' episode \"Air Mater\").\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Chug, a fuel truck<ref name=\"USAPeek\" />\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Dottie, a [[forklift]]<ref name=\"USAPeek\" />\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Leadbottom, a [[biplane]]<ref name=\"USAPeek\" /> inspired by the [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75]]<ref name=\"CNNBautista\" /> with a partial [[NACA cowling|engine cowl]].\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Rochelle, a racing plane<ref name=\"USAPeek\">{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Look!
