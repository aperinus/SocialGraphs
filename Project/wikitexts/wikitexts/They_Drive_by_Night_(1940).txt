The picture involves a pair of embattled truck drivers and was released in the UK under the title '''''The Road to Frisco'''''. The film was based on [[A. I. Bezzerides]]' 1938 novel ''[[The Long Haul (novel)|Long Haul]]'', which was later reprinted under the title ''They Drive by Night'' to capitalize on the success of the film. Part of the film's plot (that of Ida Lupino's character murdering her husband by carbon monoxide poisoning) was borrowed from another Warner Bros. film, ''[[Bordertown (1935 film)|Bordertown]]'' (1935) with [[Paul Muni]] and [[Bette Davis]]; almost a year after the release of ''Bordertown'', actress and comedienne [[Thelma Todd]]'s actual death in 1935 by carbon monoxide poisoning in her garage is generally agreed to be an accident resulting from intoxication.\n\n==Plot==\nBrothers Joe and Paul Fabrini are independent truck drivers who make a meager living transporting goods. Joe convinces Paul to start their own small, one-truck business, staying one step ahead of [[loan shark]] Farnsworth, who is trying to repossess their truck.\n\nAt a diner, Joe is attracted to waitress Cassie Hartley. Later, on their way to [[Los Angeles]], the brothers pick up a hitchhiker; Joe is pleased when it turns out to be Cassie, who quit after her boss tried to get a bit too friendly with her. They park at a diner for a meal and chat with a trucker acquaintance, McNamara, who is extremely overworked and tired; later, back on the road, the brothers and Cassie find themselves driving behind McNamara and soon become aware that he must be asleep at the wheel. They put themselves in danger trying to awaken him, but McNamara's truck goes off the road and explodes in flames.\n\nAt his home just outside of Los Angeles, Paul is reunited with his patient though worried wife, Pearl, who would rather have Paul settle down in a safer, more regular job. Paul is troubled about his future, too, but will not leave his brother \"out on a limb as long as he thinks we have a chance in this business\". In the city,  Joe finds Cassie a place to stay. They talk and begin to establish a relationship.\n\nThe next morning, from a window overlooking the market, Joe's good friend Ed Carlsen watches Joe get into a brief fistfight. Ed is a trucking business owner and former driver; he calls Joe up to his office and offers him a job. Joe insists on remaining independent. Ed's wife, Lana Carlsen has wanted Joe for years but he has always rebuffed her advances.\n\nEd gives Joe a tip on a load which results in the brothers earning enough money to finally pay off Farnsworth. On the return trip, Paul falls asleep at the wheel, causing an accident which costs him his right arm and wrecks the truck.\n\nWhen Ed hires Joe as a driver, Lana persuades her husband to make him the traffic manager instead; she starts dropping by the office frequently. Joe continues to spurn her advances. One night, when Lana drives a drunk, unconscious Ed home from a party, she murders him on impulse, by leaving him in the garage with the car motor still idling. When the police investigate,  it appears to be an accident. She later gives Joe a half-interest as a partner in the business in a subsequent attempt to attract him.\n\nPaul has been bitter over his inability to land a proper job in order to support his wife and plan a family. He returns to work as a dispatcher for Joe. Joe does a fine job managing the business, but when Lana learns he plans to marry Cassie, she becomes so enraged she reveals to him that she killed Ed so that she could have him. She then goes to the police, accusing Joe of forcing her to help commit murder. Joe is tried based on no evidence except the accusation made by Lana. During the trial, a guilt-ridden Lana breaks down on the witness stand, laughing hysterically and claiming the electric garage doors made her do it.\n\nAfter Lana is determined to be insane, the case is dismissed.  Joe considers going back to the road, but Cassie, Paul - who happily announces that Pearl and he are having a baby - and the boys manage to convince him otherwise.  He thus returns to the trucking business that he had dreamed of owning, with his brother as traffic manager and Cassie as his bride-to-be.\n\n==Cast==\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCarty |first1=Clifford |title=Bogey - The Films of Humphrey Bogart |date=1965 |publisher=Cadillac Publishing Co., Inc. |pages=87 }}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[George Raft]] as Joe Fabrini\n* [[Ann Sheridan]] as Cassie Hartley\n* [[Ida Lupino]] as Lana Carlsen\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Paul Fabrini\n* [[Gale Page]] as Pearl Fabrini\n* [[Alan Hale, Sr.|Alan Hale]] as Ed J.
