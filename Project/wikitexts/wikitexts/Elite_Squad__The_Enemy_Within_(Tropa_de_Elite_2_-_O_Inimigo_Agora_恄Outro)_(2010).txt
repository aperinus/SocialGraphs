While his car is bursted by bullets, his voiceover narrates the events leading to that point.\n\nFour years prior, Nascimento arrives at [[Bangu Penitentiary Complex]] to quell a riot started by gangleader Beirada, who demands Diogo Fraga, a teacher and human rights activist, to negotiate his conditions. Fraga is escorted to the place and convinces Beirada to release the hostages, but Nascimento's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], Captain Andr\u00e9 Matias, shoots Beirada against Nascimento's orders, which results in multiple inmate deaths.\n\nNascimento learns that [[PMERJ]] commander Formoso plans to [[dishonorable discharge|dismiss him]] due to the bad publicity and confronts him in a restaurant, only to be cheered by other diners for his tough line. [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]'s State Secretary for Public Safety Guaracy seizes the opportunity and promotes Nascimento, but transfers Matias to the ordinary police as a scapegoat. Nascimento promises Matias his help, but Matias informs journalist Clara Vidal of governmental corruption and lack of support for BOPE, leading to a jail term. Fraga, now married to Nascimento's ex-wife Rosane, is elected to Rio's [[Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro|State Assembly]].\n\nNascimento expands BOPE's arsenal, personnel, armored vehicles and helicopters, enabling them to eliminate entire drug cartels from [[favela]]s, hoping this will reduce police corruption. However, dirty cops led by Major Rocha form a [[Brazilian police militias|militia]], which eliminates trafficking while [[protection racket|extorting]] money from businesses and building a [[political machine]].\n\nFour years later, disguised militiamen steal rifles from a police station in [[Tanque, Rio de Janeiro|Tanque]], one of the last drug strongholds, giving their corrupt allies a pretext to demand the authorities expel the heavily armed dealers, allowing the militia to take over. Nascimento listens to phonetaps of dealers and assures Guaracy they are uninvolved; however, corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Fabio Barbosa claims an informant has implicated them and the raid is authorized. Matias, returned to BOPE by Rocha, occupies the station and ambushes the fleeing dealers, [[torture|torturing]] captured drugleader Pepa to learn where the stolen weapons are. As Rocha arrives and inexplicably shoots Pepa, Matias confronts him, but is shot and killed by Rocha's men.\n\nDevastated by Matias' death, Nascimento, aware Fraga has been investigating the militia, taps his phone. Vidal, also investigating, enters one of Rocha's favelas and finds the Governor's re-election material. She phones Fraga but is caught by Rocha's group, who kill her and her photographer. Nascimento listens to the call, realizes Fraga is now a target, takes the recording and goes after him; as he waits outside Fraga's building, Fraga, Rafael and Rosane arrive and are attacked in a [[drive-by shooting]]. Nascimento shoots the assailant, but Rafael is wounded. They take him to the hospital and Nascimento hands the recording to Fraga, whereupon he detains and assaults Guaracy, threatening to kill everyone involved if his son dies.\n\nThe Assembly opens an investigation into the journalists' disappearances based on the recording delivered by Fraga. However, Nascimento is accused of tapping Fraga's phone to spy on Rosane, forcing his resignation. Believing his militia will be [[scapegoating|scapegoats]], Rocha attempts to ambush him after a visit to Rafael; however, Nascimento, expecting an attack, is aided by BOPE officers. They shoot some of the assailants, but Rocha escapes.\n\nNascimento is called to testify and implicates the Governor, Guaracy and many other individuals such as Gregorio Fortunato, a legislator and TV host who supported the militia, as many corrupt officers and associates are murdered to prevent them from testifying. The Governor, however, is re-elected and Guaracy becomes representative for Rio. The final scene shows Nascimento reflecting over the political scenario in Brazil and stating that \"as long as the conditions for the system remain, it will remain\". He visits Rafael as he slowly wakes from his [[coma]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as Roberto Nascimento, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] of the [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|PMERJ]] and State Subsecretary for Public Safety.\n* [[Irandhir Santos]] as Diogo Fraga, a [[History]] teacher who becomes a State Representative after the Bangu I controversy. Rosane's new husband, he is a left-wing politician who runs for state representative in the Federal Chamber of Deputies. Fraga's role was inspired by real life politician [[Marcelo Freixo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2011/11/brazil-reality-of-militias-is-fiercer-than-fiction/|title=BRAZIL: Reality of Militias Is Fiercer than Fiction {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref>\n* Andr\u00e9 Ramiro as Captain Andr\u00e9 Matias, a BOPE officer.\n* [[Maria Ribeiro]] as Rosane Fraga, ex-wife of Nascimento current wife of Fraga.\n* [[Pedro Van-Hel]] as Rafael \"Rafa\" Nascimento, the teenage son of Nascimento and Rosane.\n* [[:pt:Sandro Rocha|Sandro Rocha]] (article on Portuguese Wikipedia) as Captain/Major Rocha, one of the main antagonists of the film. Rocha had a small role in the first film, being one of the sargeants under Fabio's control.\n* [[Milhem Cortaz]] portrays Lieutenant Colonel/[[Colonel]] Fabio Barbosa.\n* [[Tain\u00e1 M\u00fcller]] plays Clara, a journalist. In the film, Matias reads her interview on the scrapping of the BOPE, after being expelled from the same battalion because of the events in the rebellion in Bangu I and then assists the Deputy Diogo Fraga in investigating of the militias.\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Mattos]] as Fortunato, state representative and host of a tabloid TV show.\n* [[Seu Jorge]] as Beirada, a convict responsible for the Bangu I uprising.\n\n== Production ==\n===Casting and characters===\nThe first member to be acknowledged was Wagner Moura, who returns with his character Roberto Nascimento, now promoted from [[Captain (land)|captain]] to [[lieutenant colonel]]. In ''Elite Squad: The Enemy Within'', Nascimento is 40 years old and has a slightly grayer hair. [[Andr\u00e9 Ramiro]] is also back as Captain Andr\u00e9 Matias (promoted from [[Officer Cadet]]); the actor was prepped by professionals from the CATI-[[SWAT]] to give orders to the cops on-screen. Musician and actor [[Seu Jorge]] (who played Man\u00e9 Galinha in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'') was invited by director Jos\u00e9 Padilha to act as one of the antagonists, Beirada; [[Maria Ribeiro]] is also back as Roseane, who is no longer married to Nascimento, but to a [[left wing]] [[National Congress of Brazil|Congressman]]. [[Tain\u00e1 M\u00fcller]], who was not in the first film, plays Clara, representing the media. Sandro Rocha, who had little on-screen time during the first film, has a bigger role now, playing Major Rocha, known as ''Russo'' (Russian), boss of the militia.\n\n=== Cast preparation ===\nBetween November and December 2009, before recording for the film started, every actor - except Maria Ribeiro, pregnant at the time - had a training routine, led by F\u00e1tima Toledo. Part of the cast also went through a [[Training camp|boot camp]] in Rio, coordinated by Paulo Storani, security adviser, and with the participation of members from BOPE and CATI. Andr\u00e9 Ramiro said, \"They treated us like real cops. No 'I'm-too-important'. I also had to say 'No, sir. Yes, sir'\". Wagner Moura had [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|Jiu-Jitsu]] lessons from fighter [[Rickson Gracie]]. The training helped bring a degree of reality to the film; actors had to learn the proper techniques to handle weapons and also action strategies in risk-zones, besides a strong fitness program, laid heavy on those who weren't in the first movie.\n\n===Filming and post-production===\nFilming started on January 25 of 2010, with the participation of eighty real cops as extras. On February 1, recording took place at Morro [[Dona Marta]], in the [[Botafogo]] borough, with the use of two helicopters and heavy guns, leading to next-door neighbors thinking it was a real shoot-out. For the scenes happening at the [[Bangu (neighborhood)|Bangu]] 1 prison, forty professionals worked during two months constructing a 500m\u00b2 detention center, based on notations from art director Tiago Marques about the place, since they didn't get clearance to take pictures of the real building. The scenes at the prison were recorded during the four days of the 2010 carnival. One of the film scenes would be shot at the [[National Congress of Brazil#The building|House of Congress]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]], but production couldn't get permission. A fake Ethics Committee was built inside the Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro, recording took place at April 15. Filming was done in the same month and the film went to post-production.\n\n== Release ==\n=== Strategy against leaks ===\nAfter the first film leaked and got in the hands of millions of people before the official release date,<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cajueiro|first=Marcelo|title='Elite' stirs controversy, box office|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974360?refCatId=1278|magazine=Variety|access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref> the ''Elite Squad 2'' crew created a strategy to avoid the same thing happening to the prequel. Before production began, Marcos Prado informed that, \"This time we will have a special security scheme. We will have a security team watching over the editing, transporting the reels, and paying close attention to every little detail. The raw material will be preserved\". Director Jos\u00e9 Padilha concluded, \"We won't outsource any of the steps. We are doing the whole post-production at our company, inside our '{{wikt-lang|pt|caveir\u00e3o}}'\". The script was sent to the National Agency of Cinema under the title \"Organized crime\" and was printed with red ink, to avoid photocopying. The production unit rented an apartment, monitored by cameras, where editing took place. Four people had access to the place, only through passwords, and no means of accessing the Internet. Another strategy used was the marking of each copy sent to the theaters; that way if any of the copies was illegally recorded, they would know where it came from. Military policemen from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] also helped in avoiding the leak. The final picture, still with no sound, was put in a safe.\n\n=== Domestic release ===\n''Elite Squad: The Enemy Within'' broke national opening weekend records in Brazil, with more than 1.25 million spectators during its first weekend.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jungledrumsonline.com/reviews/films/elite-squad-the-enemy-within-review/ |title=Elite Squad: The Enemy Within |access-date=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925205740/http://jungledrumsonline.com/reviews/films/elite-squad-the-enemy-within-review/ |archive-date=2011-09-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This opening was the 5th biggest in Brazilian history and the biggest one for a Brazilian film, so far.
