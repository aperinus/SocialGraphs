The gang members hide their faces behind traditional demon masks when committing their violent crimes. During psychotic episodes, Dave experiences his own demons within as he sets out to play off the gang members against each other, resulting in everyone's annihilation. It is then revealed that Dave was brought up by a [[Expressed emotion|high expressed emotion]] father in a socio-economically disadvantaged living environment. He witnessed his father's death inadvertently caused by the responsible policeman who resembled Hon Kong. As a young, innocent soul who had lost his father, he impulsively went on to take revenge, resulting in excessive guilt that predisposed the onset of psychosis later in his life. The event whereby he rescued Hon Kong reminded him of his suppressed memories as a child who had done wrong but trying the hardest to make reparation. Before his inevitable death, there was an opportunity for him to resolve his subconscious intrapersonal conflicts which was to have the courage to fix a mistake done.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Daniel Wu]] as Dave Wong\n*[[Nick Cheung]] as Hon Kong / Riot police officer\n*Christie Chen as Liz Kwok\n*[[Andy On]] as Ben Chan\n*[[Liu Kai-chi]] as Broker\n*[[Dominic Lam]] as Inspector Mok (pops.)\n*Joseph Lee as Effigy\n*[[Stephen Au]] as MC\n*[[Chi Kuan-chun]] as Dave's father\n*Ken Wong as Smart Ass\n*[[Deep Ng]] as Kwong\n*Samuel Leung as Rookie\n*Lam Tsing as Chanter\n*Philip Keung as Station Sergeant\n*[[Astrid Chan]] as Stephanie\n*Fung So-bor as Granny\n*Wu Ying-man as Private nurse\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|3511542}}\n\n{{Dante Lam}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Dante Lam]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2014 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2014 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s Hong Kong films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-HongKong-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
