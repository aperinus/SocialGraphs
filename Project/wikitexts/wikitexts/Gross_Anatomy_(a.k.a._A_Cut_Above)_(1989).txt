It was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Slovak is a brilliant first-year [[medical school]] student whose nonconformist approach to life is tested when he enrolls in [[gross anatomy]], the toughest course in med school. His schoolfriends and lab partners include Kim, a pregnant woman; Miles, a buttoned-down blue-blood; Laurie, an overly ambitious student determined to make it; and David, an over analyzer who is also his roommate. Joe's freewheeling, independent style creates funny moments in the classroom, but puts him at odds with the demanding department head, Dr. Woodruff, who questions whether her easygoing \"class rebel\" has what it takes to be a doctor. Meanwhile, Joe falls in love with his lab partner Laurie, who won't let anything, especially romance, interfere with her plans. And while Joe's never done anything by the book, he proves he does have what it takes to succeed &mdash; without changing his ways. However, Joe's ways and the ways of medicine come to a head when he is ordered to do an extra credit assignment by Dr. Woodruff involving a complex diagnosis. Joe correctly diagnoses it as a serious, difficult-to-treat chronic illness and learns the patient is Dr. Woodruff herself.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Joe Slovak\n* [[Daphne Zuniga]] as Laurie Rorbach\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Dr. Rachel Woodruff\n* [[Todd Field]] as David Schreiner\n* John Scott Clough as Miles Reed\n* Alice Carter as Kim McCauley\n* [[Robert Desiderio]] as Dr. Banks\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Dr. Banumbra\n* Ryan Cash as Frankie Slovak\n\n==Reception==\n''Gross Anatomy'' was released domestically on October 20, 1989, earning $2,830,387 in 853 theaters during its opening weekend.
