It is based on the [[Flags of Our Fathers|2000 book of the same name]] written by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] and [[Ron Powers]] about the 1945 [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], the five Marines and one Navy corpsman who were involved in [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|raising the flag on Iwo Jima]], and the after effects  of that event on their lives.\n\nThe film is taken from the American viewpoint of the Battle of Iwo Jima, while its companion film, ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'', which Eastwood also directed, is from the Japanese viewpoint of the battle. Although it was a box office failure, only grossing $65.9 million against a $90 million budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/>\n\nThe companion film ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' was released in Japan on December 9, 2006, and in the United States on December 20, 2006, two months after the release of ''Flags of Our Fathers'' on October 20, 2006.\n\nUntil June 23, 2016, the author Bradley's father [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], Navy corpsman, was misidentified as being one of the figures who raised the second flag, and incorrectly depicted on the bronze statue memorial, as one of the five flag-raisers of the {{convert|32|foot|m|adj=on}} monument.<ref>[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624115022/http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/|date=June 24, 2016}}, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016</ref> Also, until October 16, 2019, [[Rene Gagnon]] was also misidentified.\n\n==Plot==\nAs three US servicemen \u2013 [[United States Marines|Marine]] Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy Pharmacist's Mate]] [[Petty officer, second class|2nd Class]] [[John Bradley (Navy)|John \"Doc\" Bradley]] \u2013 are feted as heroes in a [[war bond]] drive, they reflect on their experiences via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nAfter training at [[Camp Tarawa]] in Hawaii, the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marine Regiment]] [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] sails to invade Iwo Jima. The Navy bombards suspected Japanese positions for three days. Sergeant [[Mike Strank]] is put in charge of Second Platoon.\n\nThe next day, February 19, 1945, the Marines land in [[Higgins boat]]s and [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]]. The beaches are silent and Private First Class [[Ralph Ignatowski|Ralph \"Iggy\" Ignatowski]] wonders if the defenders are all dead before Japanese heavy artillery and machine guns open fire on the advancing Marines and the Navy ships. Casualties are heavy, but the beaches are secured.\n\nTwo days later, the Marines attack [[Mount Suribachi]] under a rain of Japanese artillery and machine gun fire, as the Navy bombards the mountain. Doc saves the lives of several Marines under fire, which later earns him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. The mountain is eventually secured.\n\nOn February 23, the platoon under command of Sergeant [[Hank Hansen]] reaches the top of Mount Suribachi and hoists the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to cheers from the beaches and the ships. Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]], who witnesses the flag raising as he lands on the beach, requests the flag for himself. Colonel [[Chandler W. Johnson|Chandler Johnson]] decides his 2nd Battalion deserves the flag more. Rene is sent up with Second Platoon to replace the first flag with a second one for Forrestal to take. Mike, Doc, Ira, Rene, and two other Marines (Corporal [[Harlon Block]] and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]]) are photographed by [[Joe Rosenthal]] as they raise the second flag.\n\nOn March 1, the Second Platoon is ambushed from a Japanese [[machine gun nest]]. During the fight over the nest, Mike is hit by a U.S. Navy shell and dies from his wounds. Later that day, Hank is shot in the chest and dies, and Harlon is killed by machine gun fire.\n\nTwo nights later, while Doc is helping a wounded Marine, Iggy is abducted by Japanese troops and dragged into a tunnel. Doc finds his viciously mangled body a few days later. On March 21, Franklin is killed by machine gun fire and dies in Ira's arms. Of the eight men in the squad, only three are left: Doc, Ira, and Rene. A few days after Franklin's death, Doc is wounded by artillery fire while trying to save a fellow corpsman. He survives and is sent back home. On March 26, the battle ends and the U.S. Marines are victorious.\n\nAfter the battle, the press gets hold of Rosenthal's photograph. It is a huge morale booster and becomes famous. Rene is asked to name the six men in the photo; he identifies himself, Mike, Doc, and Franklin, but misidentifies Harlon as Hank. Rene eventually names Ira as the sixth man, even after Ira threatens to kill him for doing so.\n\nDoc, Ira, and Rene are sent home as part of the seventh bond tour. When they arrive to a hero's welcome in [[Washington, DC]], Doc notices that Hank's mother is on the list of mothers of the dead flag raisers. Ira angrily denounces the bond drive as a farce. The men are reprimanded by Bud Gerber of the [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]], who tells them that the country cannot afford the war and if the bond drive fails, the U.S. will abandon the Pacific and their sacrifices will be for nothing. The three agree not to tell anyone that Hank was not in the photograph.\n\nAs the three are sent around the country to raise money and make speeches, Ira is [[survivor guilt|guilt-ridden]], faces discrimination as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and descends into alcoholism.  After he throws up one night in front of General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], commandant of the Marine Corps, he is sent back to his unit and the bond drive continues without him.\n\nAfter the war, the three survivors return to their homes. Ira still struggles with alcoholism and is never able to escape his unwanted fame. One day after being released from jail, he hitchhikes over 1,300 miles to [[Texas]] to see Harlon Block's family. He tells Harlon's father that his son was indeed at the base of the flag in the photograph. In 1954, the [[Marine Corps War Memorial|USMC War Memorial]] is dedicated and the three flag raisers see each other one last time. In 1955, Ira is found dead and he is suspected to have died from exposure after a night of drinking. There was no autopsy. That same year, Doc drives to the town where Iggy's mother lives to tell her how Iggy died, though it is implied that he does not tell her the truth. Rene attempts a business career, but finds that the opportunities and offers he received during the bond drive are rescinded. After failing to find work as a police officer, he spends the rest of his life as a janitor. Doc, by contrast, is successful, buying a funeral home. In 1994, on his deathbed, he tells his story to [[James Bradley (author)|his son, James]], and in a final flashback to 1945, the men swim in the ocean after raising the flags.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Pharmacist's Mate Second Class [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], the only one of the six flag raisers who was not a Marine\n** [[George Grizzard]] as Elderly John Bradley\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]]\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]]\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Technical Sergeant [[Keyes Beech]]\n* [[John Slattery]] as Bud Gerber\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Hank Hansen]], who helped with the first flag raising and was misidentified as Harlon Block\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Private [[Ralph Ignatowski]]\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Sergeant [[Michael Strank]]\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Lieutenant Colonel [[Chandler W.
