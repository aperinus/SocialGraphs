The subtitle is a reference to the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', which was then at the height of its popularity.\n\n==Plot==\nA new generation of [[nerd]] students now rule on campus at Adams College. The Alpha Betas are respectful of the nerds' prominence. Everything changes when a successful but reprehensible businessman, Orrin Price, becomes a member of the Adams College Board of Regents. A new generation of [[Jock (subculture)|jock]]s has also come to Adams, including Orrin's nerd-hating son. Former Alpha Beta Stan Gable, now a [[motorcycle]] police officer, is installed as the new Dean of Students by Orrin Price.\n\nLewis, who chairs Adams' Computer Science Department, has been distancing himself from his nerd past by growing a [[ponytail]] and asking people to call him \"Lew\" rather than Lewis. His nephew Harold, now a student at Adams, is surprised at his uncle's behavior, pointing out that in his day Lewis was the \"[[George Washington]] of nerds\". Betty, now married to Lewis and also an art professor at Adams College, tries to remind him that she fell in love with him because he had the courage to be himself. But Lewis is more interested in becoming friends with the new dean, not noticing that Stan Gable hopes to break up his marriage and win back Betty. Meanwhile, Harold and his friend pledge Lambda Lambda Lambda, whose group now includes an [[obese]] kilt-wearing English inductee and a [[Koreans|Korean]] [[Elvis impersonator]], who emphasizes that he is ''South'' Korean when asked about his [[dixie]] accent. Harold successfully makes it through the Tri-Lamb's \"rush week\". However, a barbeque celebrating the new members is disrupted by Alpha Betas in ski masks. More harassment comes, and the Tri-Lambs look for legal help, but have a hard time finding a suitable alumni due to most of them getting technical jobs. However, one alumni is an attorney, Dudley \"Booger\" Dawson. Booger warns Lewis about the harassment, but leaves in disgust when he sees Betty and Lewis socializing with Stan, calling Lewis a \"self hater\".\n\nLewis reaches out to Stan to help defend the Tri-Lambs, but Stan says no. Lewis angrily reminds Stan that he was forgiving of their rocky past and even defended him when others were telling him Stan was worthless. But Stan says that he is not Lewis' friend and that Lewis will always be a nerd. This betrayal spurs Lewis to once again embrace his nerd self. He arranges [[bail]] for the arrested Tri-Lambs by putting up his house as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. He then calls upon all nerds, those on campus and in the city, who are sympathetic to their cause to participate in a massive nerd strike. Many of the city's basic utilities and services become crippled. To end the strike, Price frames Lewis for embezzling college funds and harvesting [[marijuana]] in the basement of the Tri-Lamb house. Stan thinks Orrin Price has gone too far, yet does not object to Price's actions. The strike is called off after Lewis is arrested. Betty confronts Stan about getting Lewis released, even offering herself to sleep with him. Stan becomes deeply ashamed and declines her offer.\n\nMany of Lewis' old Tri-Lamb friends as well as his father return to support him. At the trial, the judge denies all of Booger's arguments and says that Lewis is guilty. Stan has a change of heart and testifies against Price, admitting that he has proof that Price framed Lewis for the theft and also planted the marijuana. Stan also admits that he is a nerd and has always wanted to read books and learn as much as possible, but his family always discouraged it. Price is arrested, and the charges against Lewis are dismissed. The Tri-Lambs are cleared, and the Alpha Betas are defeated once again, this time losing their Adams fraternity charter. Stan feels it best that he resign as dean of students, but Lewis convinces Stan to stay on. The nerds accept Stan as one of their own, once again guaranteeing nerd freedom at Adams College.\n\n==Cast==\nThis film features a new generation of nerds in the [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]] fraternity and also marks the return of several other characters from the first two films.\n{{col div}}\n* [[Robert Carradine]] as Lewis \"Lew\" Skolnick \n* [[Ted McGinley]] as Stanley Harvey \"Stan\" Gable\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Dudley \"Booger\" Dawson\n* [[Julia Montgomery]] as Betty Childs Skolnick\n* [[Morton Downey, Jr.]] as Orrin Price\n* [[Gregg Binkley]] as Harold Skolnick\n* [[Jennifer Bassey]] as Ruth\n* Richard Israel as Ira Poppus\n* [[Henry Cho]] as Steve Toyota\n* [[Bernie Casey]] as U.

Gilbert appears in the film, played by Mike Greenwood, while Sean Whalen plays the role of Wormser, replacing [[Andrew Cassese]]. Alan Wittert takes the role of Dean Ulich, replacing [[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]]. The Poindexter character was written out of the series due to actor [[Timothy Busfield]] choosing not to participate in the film.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', critic Carole Kucharewicz summarized that \"although the concept is no longer fresh, it provides some hearty, though rather far between, laughs. 'Nerd' devotees will stick it through to the end although the uninitiated may not get past the first hour; or they may not just get it.\" She was pleased that despite the film's subtitle, it was chiefly focused on the same themes and characters that made the first film in the series so enjoyable. She said that while many of the sight gags and the performances of Armstrong, Carradine, and Cho were genuinely hilarious, the script became bogged down in flat material for long stretches.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kucharewicz |first=Carole |title=Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation |url=https://variety.com/1992/tv/reviews/revenge-of-the-nerds-iii-the-next-generation-1200430342/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=5 March 2020 |date=July 13, 1992}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s brief review gave the film a C, remarking that \"There are a few chuckles in ''Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation'', but the sustained merriment of the original is long gone.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=O'Toole |first=Lawrence |title=Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation |url=https://ew.com/article/1993/04/09/revenge-nerds-iii-next-generation/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=5 March 2020 |date=April 9, 1993}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Anchor|DVD|Video}} \nThe film was released on [[DVD]] both as part of the Atomic Wedgie Collection and separately.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Revenge Of Nerds: The Atomic Wedgie Collection|url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Revenge-Of-Nerds-The-Atomic-Wedgie-Collection/5614329|access-date=2021-01-04|website=Walmart.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0105251}}\n*{{Amg movie|41175}}\n\n{{Revenge of the Nerds}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Revenge Of The Nerds III: The Next Generation}}\n[[Category:1990s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1992 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 television films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox Television films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about fraternities and sororities]]\n[[Category:Fox network original films]]\n[[Category:Revenge of the Nerds|Revenge Of The Nerds 3]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
