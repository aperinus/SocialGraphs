A third film, titled ''Sicario: Capos'' is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot section should between 400\u2013700 words. -->\nIn [[Chandler, Arizona]], [[FBI]] Special Agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a [[Sonora Cartel]] safe house where they discover dozens of decaying corpses hidden in the walls. Outside, an explosive [[booby trap]] kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate is recommended for and joins a [[Joint Task Force]] overseen by [[CIA]] operative Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick. Their mission is to apprehend Sonora lieutenant Manuel D\u00edaz.\n\nThe team, which includes [[Delta Force]] operators, [[U.S. Marshals]], and CIA personnel, travels to [[Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico]] to [[extradite]] D\u00edaz's brother, Guillermo. While crossing the [[El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez]] border, the team is ambushed by cartel hitmen who Delta Force swiftly kills. During the gunfight, Kate is forced to kill a [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federale]] and is left visibly disturbed by the violence. Back in the U.S., Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near [[Nogales, Sonora]] to [[smuggle drugs]]. Meanwhile, Kate confronts Matt, who reveals that the real mission is to disrupt D\u00edaz's drug operations so he will lead them to his boss, [[drug lord]] Fausto Alarc\u00f3n. Unnerved, Kate asks Reggie to join her for support.\n\nThe task force raids a bank used to [[money laundering|launder]] D\u00edaz's money. After finding financial evidence, Kate and Reggie want to start a legal case against D\u00edaz but are ordered to stand down to avoid jeopardizing the operation. At a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a local police officer. Kate and Ted become intimate at her apartment, but she realizes Ted is working with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted strangles Kate before Alejandro appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt reveal they used her as bait, knowing the cartel would target her after seeing her face on the bank's [[CCTV]]. Alejandro and Matt brutally beat Ted to coerce him into revealing the names of other officers working for D\u00edaz.\n\nAfter the team learns that D\u00edaz has been recalled to Mexico, they prepare to raid the tunnel near Nogales. Matt reveals to Kate and Reggie that their involvement is a [[Posse Comitatus Act|technical necessity]] as the CIA is not allowed to operate alone within US borders. An angered Reggie tells Kate they should leave, but she insists on staying to learn about the mission's true purpose. As a gunfight with the cartel begins, Kate follows Alejandro into Mexico. She sees him abduct Silvio, a [[Police corruption in Mexico|corrupt Sonora police officer]] working as one of D\u00edaz's [[drug mules]]. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her in her [[Kevlar]] vest before driving away with Silvio at gunpoint. On the U.S. side of the border, Kate confronts Matt, who explains the mission is part of a broader operation to consolidate the cartels into a single entity that the U.S. can more easily control. Alejandro, who previously worked for the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] in [[Colombia]], was hired to assassinate Alarc\u00f3n, the man responsible for ordering the murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter when he was a prosecutor in Ju\u00e1rez. Alejandro kills Silvio after he stops D\u00edaz's vehicle and forces D\u00edaz to drive to Alarc\u00f3n's estate. On arrival, he quickly kills D\u00edaz, Alarc\u00f3n's guards, his wife, two sons, and Alarc\u00f3n.\n\nThe next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement attesting that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him but cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. In Nogales, Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game, which is briefly interrupted by the sound of distant gunfire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Kate Macer, an [[FBI]]
