Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1999 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same name]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the 1925 novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. The women are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage, with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States two days later on December 27 before expanding in January 2003. Critical reaction to the film was positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot |date=September 2022}}\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the film takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them following three women: Virginia Woolf in 1923, Laura Brown in 1951, and Clarissa Vaughan in 2001. The following plot summary has been simplified and is in chronological order, not the order as presented in the film.\n\n=== 1923 ===\nVirginia Woolf has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. Virginia has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression. She is constantly under the eye of her servants and her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children, [[Julian Bell|Julian]], [[Quentin Bell|Quentin]], and [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica]], come over for an afternoon visit. She and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. She longs for a life similar to Vanessa, living in London. Vanessa's children find a dead bird. Virginia and Angelica make a funeral for the bird. Virginia lies down beside the bird and looks into its eyes. She sees herself in the dead bird, suffering and dying in her circumstances. Everyone goes back inside and Virginia continues writing her book. She says that she was going to kill her heroine but instead chooses to kill another character in the book. Before Vanessa leaves, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. It is clear Virginia wants them to stay and wants her sister's life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the train station, where she is awaiting a train to London. Leonard arrives to stop her, and they argue. He tells her that Richmond was intended to soothe her mental illness and that he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She replies that she also lives with that fear but argues that she has the right to choose her own destiny and that she would prefer London, even if it means her death, to remaining stifled in Richmond. Leonard mournfully concedes, and they return home, where Virginia begins writing again. Leonard questions her as to why someone has to die. Virginia says \u201cIn order that the rest of us should value life more.\u201d Leonard asks who will die and Virginia says \"The poet will die, the visionary.\u201d\n\n=== 1951 ===\nPregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] in Los Angeles with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty tries to stay upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and embraces her. Laura escalates this comforting gesture into a passionate kiss; Kitty then leaves, politely refusing to acknowledge the kiss. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother in anguish as she drives away, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks in to a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded and almost drowns. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly button and cries. She picks up Richie and kisses him, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday. Dan gratefully says the dream of this domestic happiness is what kept him going during the war, seemingly oblivious to Laura's dissatisfaction.\n\n=== 2001 ===\nClarissa Vaughan, a literary editor in New York City, shares a first name with the novel's title character. She spends the day preparing to host a party in honor of her friend and ex-lover Richard, a moody poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award. Clarissa was in a relationship with Richard during their college years, but has spent the past 10 years living with a female partner, Sally Lester, while also caring for Richard during his illness. Richard tells Clarissa that he has only stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless, given more to acknowledge his illness than for the work itself. She tries reassuring him. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" \u2013 her namesake \u2013 because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does. Clarissa returns home, surprised to meet Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Louis and Clarissa discuss Richard's [[roman \u00e0 clef|use of their real lives]] in his novel and Clarissa's feelings of \"unraveling.\" Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare, and listens while Clarissa admits that her life feels trivial and false in comparison to her youthful happiness. When Clarissa goes to bring Richard to his party, [[Soviet montage theory|editing]] reveals that Richard is the young boy from 1951. Deeply distraught, he tells Clarissa that he cannot bear to face \"the hours\" that will make up the rest of his life, then commits suicide in front of her by falling from a window. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura Brown, arrives at Clarissa's apartment. Laura is aware that her abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It was death. I chose life.\"\n\nThe film ends with Virginia's suicide by drowning with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: \"Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===1923===\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Virginia Woolf]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Leonard Woolf]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Vanessa Bell]]\n* George Loftus as [[Quentin Bell]]\n* Charley Ramm as [[Julian Bell]]\n* Sophie Wyburd as [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica Bell]]\n* [[Lyndsey Marshal]] as Lottie Hope\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Nelly Boxall\n{{col-3}}\n\n===1951===\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Laura Brown\n* [[John C.

And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score\u2014tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title=Holiday Movie Preview: The Hours|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL|date=December 23, 2002|access-date=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022090123/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|archive-date=October 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted.

It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ...
