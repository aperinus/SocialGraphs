The film is set in [[Warsaw]]. The film was selected as the Polish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[61st Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNineteen-year-old Tomek ([[Olaf Lubaszenko]]) is living in an apartment complex in Warsaw with his godmother (Stefania Iwinska) - staying in her son's room while he's away. Raised in an [[orphanage]], the shy Tomek has few friends and works as a postal clerk. Tomek has been spying on a beautiful older woman, Magda ([[Gra\u017cyna Szapolowska]]), who lives in an adjacent apartment complex. Using a telescope, he watches her every night performing mundane tasks, working on her artwork, and entertaining men. To get closer to her, he slips fake postal notices in her mailbox for a nonexistent money order at his post office. He also calls her anonymously to hear her voice. Tomek's obsession is focused more on her everyday activities rather than her sex life; when he sees her becoming sexual with men, he trains the telescope away and does not watch.\n\nTomek learns there is a problem with the milk deliveries for Magda's apartment complex, so he takes the delivery job to be closer to her. One night he sees her return home after breaking up with her latest boyfriend, spilling a bottle of milk, and then weeping over another failed relationship. Later, Tomek asks his godmother, \"Why do people cry?\" After receiving another fake postal notice, Magda has a confrontation with the postmistress who accuses her of extortion. When Magda walks away upset, Tomek follows her and admits that he has been leaving the fake postal notices, that he saw her crying, and that he's been watching her. That night, Magda arranges her bed so that Tomek can see her with another boyfriend. When they're in bed, she tells him that they're being watched by someone across the way. The boyfriend rushes down to the street, calls out to Tomek who comes downstairs, and then punches him in the face for peeping.\n\nThe next day, while delivering milk to Magda, Tomek admits that he loves her and that he expects nothing in return. Overwhelmed by his feelings, Tomek rushes up to the roof of the building, and then returns to Magda's apartment and asks her for a date\u2014and she accepts. An elated Tomek races through the courtyard with his milk cart. During their date at a cafe, Magda learns that Tomek has been watching her for a year and that he stole letters mailed to her by an old boyfriend. At first, she's upset, but then she dismisses it saying, \"What does it matter.\" In response to his earlier declaration of love, she tells him that love doesn't exist\u2014only sex. She shows him how to caress her hands the way lovers do.\n\nLater that night at her apartment, after she showers and changes into a short bathrobe, he gives her a small gift, but she says she's not a good person and doesn't deserve gifts. Crouching in front of him, she guides his hands onto her thighs and he has an orgasm. Magda says, \"Love ... that's all it is.\" After Tomek rushes out of her apartment embarrassed and upset, Magda feels guilty and tries to communicate to him at her window\u2014gesturing for him to call her and holding up a sign that reads, \"Come back. Sorry.\" But there is no response. Back in his apartment, Tomek cuts his wrists with a razor blade. Later, Magda comes to Tomek's apartment to return the coat he left behind and learns from his godmother that he tried to kill himself and was taken to hospital. Magda tells her, \"I think I hurt him.\" Tomek's godmother shows her Tomek's room and his telescope and tells her, \"He's fallen in love with you.\" When asked if he's \"fallen for the wrong woman,\" Magda responds, \"Yes.\"\n\nIn the coming days, Magda is unable to find Tomek\u2014she is clearly worried and concerned about his wellbeing. One night, she receives a phone call, and thinking it is Tomek, she acknowledges that he was right about love (the call is actually from someone with phone trouble). After days of waiting and watching Tomek's window with her small binoculars, she finally sees he's returned. Magda goes to Tomek's apartment and his godmother shows her to his room where she sees Tomek sleeping, his wrists still bandaged. The godmother prevents her from getting too close to him\u2014even preventing her from touching his bandaged wrist.{{#tag:ref|The opening scene of the film shows Magda's hand trying to touch Tomek's bandaged wrist as a flash-forward to this final scene.<ref>Insdorf 1999, p. 97.</ref>|group=Note}} Noticing the telescope, Magda looks through it toward her own apartment and imagines what Tomek must have seen that night, watching her come home, spilling the milk, and weeping over another failed relationship. Then she closes her eyes and imagines Tomek in her apartment with her, reaching out to comfort her\u2014and she smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gra\u017cyna Szapo\u0142owska]] as Magda\n* [[Olaf Lubaszenko]] as Tomek\n* Stefania Iwinska as Godmother\n* [[Piotr Machalica]] as Roman\n* Hanna Chojnacka as Miroslawa\n* [[Artur Barcis]] as Young Man\n* [[Stanislaw Gawlik]] as Postman\n* Krzysztof Koperski as Gasman in Magda's Apartment<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for A Short Film About Love |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095467/fullcredits |access-date=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Script===\nThe film is based on Kie\u015blowski's ''[[Dekalog: Six]]'', with minor changes and expansions to the script. The most significant change is to the ending, which was rewritten at the suggestion of lead actress [[Gra\u017cyna Szapo\u0142owska]], who wanted the film to have a \"fairy tale ending\".<ref>Gra\u017cyna Szapo\u0142owska, 2003 interview on American and Artificial Eye Region 2 DVD releases of ''A Short Film About Love''.</ref> The original version ends with Tomek back at work, recovered from his attempted suicide, and telling Magda that he does not watch her anymore. The film ends with Magda's more developed concern for Tomek mirroring his earlier obsession with her. The film concludes in Tomek's room after his return from hospital. She looks through his telescope into her own apartment and Kie\u015blowski replays an earlier scene of Magda crying in her kitchen, which had led Tomek to reveal his feelings to her, only this time she is joined and comforted by Tomek. Like Kie\u015blowski's other ''Dekalog'' films, it features the mysterious angelic Man in White.\n\n===Filming locations===\n* [[Warsaw]], Poland\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''A Short Film About Love'' received very positive critical reviews, with many of the critics noting that the film points to Kieslowski's later masterworks.
