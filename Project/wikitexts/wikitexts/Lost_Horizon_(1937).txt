The screenplay by [[Robert Riskin]] is based on the [[1933 in literature|1933]] [[Lost Horizon|novel of the same name]] by [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]].\n\nThe film exceeded its original budget by more than $776,000 and took five years to earn back its cost.

Before returning to Britain to become the new [[Foreign Secretary]], writer, soldier, and diplomat Robert Conway has one last task in [[China]], rescuing 90 westerners in the city of Baskul. He flies out with the last few evacuees, just ahead of armed revolutionaries.\n\nUnbeknownst to the passengers, the pilot has been forcibly replaced and their aircraft hijacked. It eventually runs out of fuel and crashes deep in the [[Himalayas]], killing their abductor. The group is rescued by Chang and his men and taken to [[Shangri-La]], an idyllic valley sheltered from the bitter cold. The contented inhabitants are led by the mysterious High [[Lama]].\n\nInitially anxious to return to civilization, most of the newcomers grow to love Shangri-La, including [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Alexander Lovett, notorious swindler Henry Barnard, and bitter, terminally ill Gloria Stone, who, miraculously, seems to be recovering. Conway is particularly enchanted, especially when he meets Sondra, who has grown up in Shangri-La. However, Conway's younger brother George and Maria, another beautiful young woman they find there, are determined to leave.\n\nConway eventually has an audience with the High Lama and learns that his arrival was no accident. The founder of Shangri-La is said to be two hundred years old, preserved, like the other residents, by the magical properties of the paradise he has created, but is finally dying and needs someone wise and knowledgeable in the ways of the modern world to keep it safe. Having read Conway's writings, Sondra believed he was the one; the Lama had agreed with her and arranged for Conway's abduction. The old man names Conway as his successor and then peacefully passes away.\n\nGeorge refuses to believe the Lama's fantastic story and is supported by Maria. Uncertain and torn between love and loyalty, Conway reluctantly gives in to his brother and they leave, taking Maria with them, despite being warned that she is much older than she appears. After several days of grueling travel, she becomes exhausted and falls face down in the snow. When they turn Maria over, they discover that she had become extremely old and died. Horrified, George loses his sanity and jumps to his death.\n\nConway continues on and eventually ends up in a Chinese mission where a search party finds him. The ordeal has caused him to lose his memory of Shangri-La. On the voyage back to Britain, he starts remembering everything; he tells his story and then jumps ship. The searchers track him back to the Himalayas, but are unable to follow him any further. Conway succeeds in returning to Shangri-La.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Ronald Colman]] as Robert Conway\n* [[Jane Wyatt]] as Sondra \n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Lovett\n* [[John Howard (American actor)|John Howard]] as George Conway \n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Barnard\n* [[Margo (actress)|Margo]] as Maria\n* [[Isabel Jewell]] as Gloria\n* [[H.

When [[Ronald Colman]], his first and only choice for the role of Robert Conway, proved to be unavailable, Capra decided to wait and made ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) instead.<ref>Scherle and Levy 1977, p. 146.</ref>\n\n[[Harry Cohn]] authorized a budget of $1.25 million for the film, the largest amount ever allocated to a project up to that time.<ref name=McBride/> According to a 1986 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' interview with [[Frank Capra Jr.]], his father had wanted to shoot the film in color, but because the only suitable [[stock footage]] he intended to incorporate into the film, such as scenes from a [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the Himalayas, was in black and white, he was forced to change his plans.<ref>Lewis, Kevin.

Retrieved: February 23, 2011.</ref> In 1985, Capra Sr. said the decision to film in black and white was made because [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|three-strip Technicolor]] was new and fairly expensive, and the studio was unwilling to increase the film's budget so he could utilize it.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 351.</ref>\n\nAn often repeated story concerns casting the part of the High Lama.  After a [[screen test]] of 56-year-old retired stage actor [[Albert Edward Anson|A.&nbsp;E. Anson]], Capra decided that he was just right for the part. He made a call to the actor's home, and the housekeeper who answered the phone was told to relay the message to Anson that the part was his.  Not long after, the housekeeper called back telling Capra that when Anson heard the news, he had a heart attack and died.  Subsequently, Capra offered the part to 58-year-old [[Henry B. Walthall]].  He died before shooting began.  Finally, to play it safer age-wise, Capra cast [[Sam Jaffe]] who was just 45.<ref>Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies</ref> This is disputed, however, by camera logs dating back to the production that indicate Anson never tested for the part. Film historian Kendall Miller surmises that this story originated as an effort to add drama to Jaffe's casting.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Miller, Kendall (writer) | date=1999 | title=Photo Documentary | medium=DVD | publisher=Columbia Tristar Home Video, Inc.}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LOST HORIZON poster 1936.jpg|left|thumb|Alternate poster by [[James Montgomery Flagg]]]] -->\nFrom the beginning, Capra ran into difficulties that resulted in serious [[cost overrun]]s. Principal photography began on March 23, 1936, and by the time it was completed on July 17, the director had spent $1.6 million.<ref>McBride 1992, p. 352.</ref> Contributing to the added expenses was the filming of snow scenes and aircraft interiors at the Los Angeles Ice and Cold Storage Warehouse, where the low temperature affected the equipment and caused lengthy delays. The [[Streamline Moderne]] sets representing Shangri-La, designed by [[Stephen Goosson]], had been constructed adjacent to Hollywood Way, a busy thoroughfare by day, which necessitated filming at night and heavily added to overtime expenses. Many exteriors were filmed on location in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]], the [[Ojai, California|Ojai Valley]], the [[Mojave Desert]], the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]], and in what is now [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]], adding the cost of transporting cast, crew, and equipment to the swelling budget.<ref name=\"McBride p. 353\">McBride 1992, p. 353.</ref>\n\nCapra also used multiple cameras to cover every scene from several angles, and by the time shooting ended, he had used 1.1 million feet of film. For one scene lasting four minutes, he shot 6,000 feet, the equivalent of one hour of screen time. He spent six days filming Sam Jaffe performing the High Lama's monologues, then reshot the scenes twice, once with [[Walter Connolly]], because it was felt Jaffe's makeup was unconvincing and he looked too young for the role. A total of 40 minutes of footage featuring the High Lama eventually was trimmed to the 12 that appeared in the final cut. Filming took one hundred days, 34 more than scheduled. The film's final cost, including prints and promotional advertising, was $2,626,620, and it remained in the red until it was reissued in 1942.<ref name=\"McBride p. 353\" />\n\nThe first cut of the film was six hours long. The studio considered releasing it in two parts, but eventually decided the idea was impractical. Working with editors [[Gene Havlick]] and [[Gene Milford]], Capra managed to trim the running time to 3\u00bd hours for the first preview in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] on November 22, 1936. Following a showing of the [[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]] ''[[Theodora Goes Wild]]'', the audience was not receptive to a drama of epic length. Many walked out, and those who remained laughed at sequences intended to be serious.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Cuts in Film 'Lost Horizon' Restored |author=Stephen Farber |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 3, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/03/movies/cuts-in-film-lost-horizon-restored.html}}</ref><ref name=Cannes>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/theDailyArticle/60920.html |title=Cannes Classics \u2013 Lost Horizon: the edits, the cuts and the restoration |author=Tarik Khaldi |date=May 17, 2016 |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}</ref> The feedback was mostly negative, and Capra was so distraught, he fled to [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] and remained in seclusion there for several days. He later claimed he burned the first two reels of the film, an account disputed by Milford, who noted setting the [[Film base#Nitrate|nitrate film]] on fire would have created a devastating explosion.<ref name=\"McBride p. 362\">McBride 1992, p. 362.</ref>\n\nFollowing the disastrous preview, Capra made extensive cuts and, on January 12, 1937, reshot scenes involving the High Lama written by [[Sidney Buchman]], who declined screen credit for his work. The new footage placed more emphasis on the growing desperation of the world situation at the time. Still unhappy with the film's length, Harry Cohn intervened; he cancelled the February 1 opening and edited the film personally. When it premiered in [[San Francisco]] on March 2, it was 132 minutes long. During the film's initial release in selected cities, it was a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow attraction]],<ref name=NYT/> with only two presentations per day and tickets sold on a reserved-seat basis. Because the box-office returns were so low, the studio head cut an additional 14 minutes before the film went into general release the following September. Due primarily to the cuts made without his approval, Capra later filed a lawsuit against Columbia, citing \"contractual disagreements\", among them, the studio's refusal to pay him a $100,000 semi-annual salary payment due him. A settlement was reached on November 27, 1937, with Capra collecting his money and being relieved of the obligation of making one of the five films required by his contract. In 1985, the director claimed Cohn, whom he described as the \"Jewish producer,\" trimmed the film simply so theaters could have more daily showings and increase the film's chance of turning a profit.<ref>McBride 1992, pp. 369\u2013370.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Lost Horizon (1937 three-sheet poster).jpg|thumb|Three-sheet theatrical poster]]\n[[Frank Nugent|Frank S.

We can deride the screen in its lesser moods, but when the West Coast impresarios decide to shoot the works the resulting pyrotechnics bathe us in a warm and cheerful glow. ... The penultimate scenes are as vivid, swift, and brilliantly achieved as the first. Only the conclusion itself is somehow disappointing. But perhaps that is inescapable, for there can be no truly satisfying end to any fantasy. ... Mr. Capra was guilty of a few directorial [[clich\u00e9]]s, but otherwise it was a perfect job.

He also regretted the film's missed opportunities: \"If the long, dull ethical sequences had been cut to the bone there would have been plenty of room for the real story: the shock of Western crudity and injustice on a man returned from a more gentle and beautiful way of life\".\n\n''Lost Horizon'' earned [[theatrical rental]]s of $3.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=champs/><ref name=wall/>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nStephen Goosson's elaborate sets won him the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]], and [[Gene Havlick]] and Gene Milford shared the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]].<ref name=\"Oscars1938\">[http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1938 \"The 10th Academy Awards (1938) Nominees and Winners.\"] ''oscars.org.''
