It was adapted by [[Alvin Sargent]] and [[William Broyles Jr.]] from the 1969 [[Cinema of France|French]] film ''[[The Unfaithful Wife]]'' by [[Claude Chabrol]]. It tells the story of a couple living in suburban New York City whose marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an affair with a stranger she encounters by chance.\n\n''Unfaithful'' grossed $52 million in North America and $119.1 million worldwide. Despite mixed reviews overall, Lane received much praise for her performance. She won awards for Best Actress from the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward and Connie Sumner live in [[Westchester County, New York]] with their eight-year-old son, Charlie. Their marriage is loving but a little monotonous and lacking in passion. While shopping in the city, the wind knocks Connie into stranger Paul Martel and they both fall over. Seeing that she's scraped her knees, Paul invites her upstairs to his apartment to treat her injuries. Uncomfortable with his advances, she leaves.\n\nFinding Paul's phone number inside the book he gave her, Connie goes into the city and calls him. He invites her over and when she arrives, he again flirts with her. She leaves despite their mutual attraction, but visits again, and they share a dance. Again uncomfortable, Connie rushes out. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet, carries her off to his bedroom, and they have sex. Connie is simultaneously turned on and terrified at what she's doing. However, they both relish the thrill of their affair, and Connie uses her work as an excuse to continue visiting Paul. Edward accidentally catches her in a lie, when a friend she said she was meeting for a fundraiser says he was out of town. This information makes Edward suspicious, and he notices Connie buying herself new lingerie, and daydreaming. Edward asks her to meet him for lunch one day, but she says can't because she has a salon appointment. Edward calls the salon and confirms Connie was lying.\n\nEdward hires a private investigator, Frank Wilson, and is devastated when he provides pictures of Connie and Paul together. The affair is taking its toll on Connie. Even though she feels guilty, Paul is distracting her from her family, and she is late to pick up Charlie from school.\n\nShe realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. The following day, she goes to the grocery store to buy some groceries and then after she drives to Paul's home and prepares to end things in person. While she drives to his apartment, she discovers him running off to the library with another woman. She jumps out of her car and runs to the library to confront Paul and the other woman. As she is in the elevator alone with Paul, they have an argument. She questions him on how many women is he seeing but Paul avoids answering the question and tells Connie that the other woman is just a friend and nothing more. She then tells Paul that she doesn't want to see him anymore and tells him their affair is over. She also calls Paul a liar and tells him that she hates him. As he exits from the elevator, Connie then closes the elevator door but Paul forces it open and starts taunting her. This angers Connie even more and tries to close the door but Paul blocks it. She then angrily pushes Paul out her way and starts walking away. However, as she angrily storms out of Paul's apartment, he manages to chase after Connie, pushes her against the wall, and begins to seduce her. While continuing to undress her, Connie tries stopping and fighting him off but is unsuccessful. She then eventually allows him to seduce her and they have sex in the hallway of his apartment. She leaves, narrowly missing Edward, who has arrived to confront Paul. Paul lets him into his apartment and they discuss Connie. Edward is stunned to find a snow globe he had given her in the past, which Paul explains she had gifted to him. Edward is clearly becoming overwhelmed and snaps and fractures Paul's skull with the snow globe, killing him instantly.\n\nWhile cleaning up the evidence, Edward overhears a crying Connie leave a message for Paul, saying that she's ending the affair; she's tired of lying and hurting her family. Edward erases the message and puts Paul's body in the trunk of his car, and drives to Charlie's school play. In the parking lot, someone bumps into the back of his car, denting the trunk. Edward is scared he'll be found out but he tells the person not to worry about the damage. He later dumps Paul's body in a landfill.\n\nNYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home, explaining that Paul's estranged wife has reported him missing. Connie is surprised to hear he had a wife, and claims she barely knows him. The detectives return a week later to reveal that Paul's body has been discovered. Edward and the detectives notice Connie growing visibly distraught upon hearing the news. Connie lies that she met Paul at a fundraiser which, to her surprise, Edward corroborates. Later, when taking Edward's clothes to the dry cleaner, she finds the photos of her and Paul, realizing Edward has known about the affair. At a party later she notices that the snow globe she gifted Paul has been returned to their collection. Sharing a meaningful look with Edward, she realizes he murdered Paul.\n\nThey argue, and Edward says that he wanted to kill her instead of Paul. In the days that follow, Connie discovers a hidden compartment in the snow globe containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message. She and Edward share sad looks.\n\nAs she burns the photographs of her and Paul, Edward says he will turn himself in, but Connie objects, saying they will find a way to move on, and they appear to return to a normal life together.\n\nOn their way home from an event one evening, Edward stops at a red light with Charlie asleep in the backseat. Connie whispers that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees, consoling her as she cries. It is revealed that Edward has stopped the car near a police station.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Edward Sumner\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Constance \"Connie\" Sumner\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Paul Martel\n* [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Charlie Sumner\n* [[Chad Lowe]] as Bill Stone\n* [[Dominic Chianese]] as Frank Wilson\n* [[Erich Anderson]] as Bob Gaylord\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Lindsay\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Tracy\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Sally\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Detective Dean\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as Josh\n* [[Damon Gupton]] as Other Businessman\n* [[Joseph Badalucco Jr.]] as Train Conductor\n}}\nAhmad Harhash as Ricky Johnson\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to actor Richard Gere, an early draft of the screenplay presented the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship, which gave Connie some justification for having an affair. According to the actor and to director Adrian Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, to create greater sympathy for Connie. Both men opposed the change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio's suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: \"I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. I loved the idea of the totally arbitrary nature of infidelity.\" The Sumners' relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair the result of a chance meeting.<ref name= \"kobel\">{{cite news | title = Smoke to Go With the Steam | first = Peter | last = Kobel | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/movies/film-smoke-to-go-with-the-steam.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 5, 2002 | access-date = June 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nDuring pre-production, the producers received a videotaped audition from Olivier Martinez, who was selected for Paul. His character was portrayed as French once Martinez was cast. Lyne said, \"I think it helps one understand how Connie might have leapt into this affair\u2014he's very beguiling, doing even ordinary things.\" Once cast in the role, Martinez, with Lyne's approval, changed some of his dialogue and the scene in which he first seduces Lane's character, while she is looking at a book in Braille. According to Martinez, \"The story that was invented before was much more sensual, erotic and clear.\"<ref name= \"topel\">{{cite news | title = Olivier Martinez Interview \u2013 ''Unfaithful'' | first = Fred | last = Topel | url = http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aa050102c.htm | work = About.com: Hollywood Movies | year = 2002 | access-date = August 24, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nLyne cast Diane Lane in the role of Constance after seeing her in the film ''[[A Walk on the Moon]]''.<ref name= \"kobel\"/> He felt that the actress \"breathes a certain sexuality.

After reading the script, Biziou felt that the story was appropriate for the classic 1.85:1 aspect ratio because it \"so often has two characters working together in the frame\". During pre-production, Biziou, Lyne and production designer [[Brian Morris (art director)|Brian Morris]] used a collection of still photographs as style references. These included photos from fashion magazines and shots by prominent photographers.<ref name = \"martin\">{{cite news | title = Broken Vows | first = Kevin H | last = Martin | work = American Cinematographer | date = June 2002 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nInitially, the story was set against snowy exteriors, but this idea was rejected early on. Principal photography began in New York City on March 22, 2001 and wrapped on June 1, 2001 with Lyne shooting in continuity whenever possible. During the windstorm sequence where Connie first meets Paul, it rained and Lyne used the overcast weather conditions for the street scenes. The director also preferred shooting practical interiors on location so that the actors could \"feel an intimate sense of belonging\", Biziou recalls. The cinematographer also used natural light as much as possible.<ref name= \"martin\" />\n\nAt times, Lyne's directing took its toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that \"makes the colors less contrasty, more muted\".<ref name = \"kobel\" /> According to Biziou, \"The texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame\".<ref name = \"martin\" /> The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 hours a day and Gere remembers, \"Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]] for [[Bronchus|bronchial]] infections\". Lane acquired an oxygen bottle in order to survive the rigorous schedule.<ref name = \"kobel\" />\n\nThe film has many explicit sex scenes, including a tryst in a restaurant bathroom and a passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were demanding for the actors, especially for Lane, who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the scenes.<ref name = \"kobel\" /> To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had the actors watch clips from ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'', ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'', and ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]''.<ref name = \"whipp\" /> Lane and Martinez would also talk over the scenes in his trailer beforehand. Once on the set, they felt uncomfortable until several takes in.
