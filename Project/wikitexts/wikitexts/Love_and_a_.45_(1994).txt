It received positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nA young couple in love \u2014 Watty Watts and Starlene \u2014 are planning a convenience store robbery. The next day, they are paid a visit by Creepy Cody and Dinosaur Bob, collectors for a local mobster whom Watty has borrowed money from to buy an engagement ring for Starlene. They inform Watty that he must get the money very soon. This is followed by a visit by Watts' drug-addicted former prison buddy, Billy Mack Black, who has a plan for a big score. Against the wishes of Starlene, Watty goes along with the plot and the robbery turns deadly when Billy shoots and kills the stoned clerk.\n\nFollowing the murder, Billy pulls his gun on Watty and forces him to go to a restaurant to eat breakfast, where Billy pulls his gun on Watty again. Fearing for his life, Watty attacks Billy with a fork and escapes. He then returns to his trailer and Starlene. He asks her to marry him and tells her they have to flee to Mexico. They are then paid a visit by two police officers, who try to kill them as revenge for the murder and robbery. Starlene manages to shoot one of the officers, who accidentally shoots the other one, and the couple escape.\n\nThey then make their way toward Mexico pursued by Billy Mack, Bob and Creepy and the police. The two are romanticized in the crime-obsessed media and become celebrities. On the way they stop in to see Starlene's parents, Thaylene and Vergil, who are later found by Billy, Bob and Creepy, leading to a violent showdown in which all are killed except Billy.\n\nBilly catches up with Watty and Starlene and the three of them cross into Mexico together. There the three engage in a showdown in which Starlene eventually kills Billy by injecting him with an overdose of high-powered speed.\n\nThe two lovers take some liquid LSD given to them by Starlene's father and drive off into the sunset to start a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Gil Bellows]] as Watty Watts\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Starlene Cheatham\n*[[Rory Cochrane]] as Billy Mack Black\n*[[Jeffrey Combs]] as Dinosaur Bob\n*[[Jace Alexander]] as Creepy Cody\n*[[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Ranger X\n*[[Jack Nance]] as Justice Thurman\n*[[Ann Wedgeworth]] as Thaylene Cheatham\n*[[Peter Fonda]] as Vergil Cheatham\n*[[Wiley Wiggins]] as Young Clerk\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Love and a .45 (soundtrack)}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1994 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1994 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s road movies]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:Trimark Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-crime-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
