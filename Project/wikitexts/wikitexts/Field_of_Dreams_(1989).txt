Kinsella]]'s 1982 novel ''[[Shoeless Joe (novel)|Shoeless Joe]]''. The film stars [[Kevin Costner]] as a farmer who builds a baseball field in his cornfield that attracts the ghosts of baseball legends, including [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] ([[Ray Liotta]]) and the [[Black Sox Scandal|Chicago Black Sox]]. [[Amy Madigan]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Burt Lancaster]] (in his final film role) also star. It was theatrically released on May 5, 1989.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=LOC>{{cite press release |publisher= [[Library of Congress]] |title= 2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams' |date= December 13, 2017 |url= https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/2017-national-film-registry-is-more-than-a-field-of-dreams/2017-12-13/ |access-date= July 2, 2018 |archive-date= December 14, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171214030216/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/2017-national-film-registry-is-more-than-a-field-of-dreams/2017-12-13/ |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{redirect|Terence Mann|other people with similar names|Terrence Mann (disambiguation)}}\nRay Kinsella lives with his wife, Annie, and daughter, Karin, on their [[Dyersville, Iowa]], corn farm. Troubled by his broken relationship with his late father, John Kinsella, a devoted [[baseball]] fan, he fears growing old without achieving anything.\n\nWhile walking through his cornfield one evening, he hears a voice whispering, \"If you build it, he will come.\" He sees a vision of a [[baseball diamond]] in the cornfield and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|\"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson]] (who in real-life died in 1951) standing in the middle. Believing in him, Annie lets him plow under part of their corn crop to build a baseball field, at risk of financial hardship.\n\nAs Ray builds the field, he tells Karin about the 1919 [[Black Sox Scandal]]. Several months pass, and just as Ray is beginning to doubt himself, Shoeless Joe reappears, asking if others can play, and returns with the seven other Black Sox players. Annie's brother, Mark, can't see the players. He warns the couple they are going bankrupt and offers to buy their land. The voice, meanwhile, urges Ray to \"ease his pain.\"\n\nRay and Annie attend a PTA meeting, where she argues against someone who is trying to ban books by Terence Mann, a controversial author and activist from the 1960s. Ray deduces the voice was referring to Mann, who had named one of his characters \"John Kinsella\" and had once professed a childhood dream of playing for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. When Ray and Annie have identical dreams about Ray and Mann attending a game at [[Fenway Park]], Ray finds Mann in [[Boston]]. Mann, who has become a disenchanted recluse, agrees to attend one game. There Ray hears the voice urging him to \"go the distance\", seeing statistics on the scoreboard for Archie [[Moonlight Graham|\"Moonlight\" Graham]], who played in one game for the [[New York Giants (MLB)|New York Giants]] in 1922 but never got to bat. Mann also admits to hearing the voice and seeing the scoreboard.\n\nThey drive to [[Chisholm, Minnesota|Minnesota]], learning that Graham, who was a physician, had died years earlier. Ray finds himself in 1972, encountering an elderly Graham, who says he happily left baseball for a satisfying medical career. During the drive back to Iowa, Ray picks up young hitchhiker Archie Graham, who is looking for a baseball team to join. Ray later tells Mann that his father dreamed of being a baseball player then tried to make him pick up the sport instead. At 14, after reading one of Mann's books, Ray stopped playing catch with his father, and they became estranged after he mocked John for having \"a hero who was a criminal.\" Ray admits that his greatest regret is that his father died before they could reconcile. Arriving at the farm, they see various all-star players have arrived, fielding a second team. A game is played and Graham finally gets his turn at bat.\n\nThe next morning, Mark returns, demanding that Ray sell the farm or the bank will foreclose on him. Karin insists that people will pay to watch the ballgames. Mann agrees, saying that \"people will come\" to relive their childhood innocence. Ray and Mark scuffle, accidentally knocking Karin off the bleachers. {{nowrap|Graham{{tsp}}{{mdash}}}}{{tsp}}despite knowing he will be unable to return after stepping off the {{nowrap|field{{tsp}}{{mdash}}}}{{tsp}}saves her. Having become old Doc Graham again, he reassures Ray that he has no regrets. As he heads back toward the cornfield, he is commended by the other players, and before he can disappear into the corn, Shoeless Joe calls out, \"Hey, rookie!\" Graham stops and turns to Shoeless Joe, who deliberately tells him, \"You were good.\" Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears before he smiles, turns back toward the corn, and disappears into it. Suddenly, Mark too can see the players and urges Ray to keep the farm.\n\nShoeless Joe invites Mann to enter the corn, and Mann disappears into it. Ray is angry at not being invited but Joe rebukes him, glancing towards the catcher at [[home plate]], saying, \"If you build it, ''he'' will come.\" When the catcher removes his mask, Ray recognizes him as his father as a young man. Ray realizes \"ease his pain\" referred to his own regrets.\n\nRay introduces John to his wife and daughter, initially without referring to him as his father. As John begins to head towards the cornfield, Ray, calling him \"Dad\", asks if he wants to have a catch. John gladly accepts as hundreds of cars are seen approaching the field, fulfilling the prophecy that people will come to watch baseball.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits, plus highlighted Black Sox players, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Ray Kinsella\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Annie Kinsella\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Karin Kinsella\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Terence Mann\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]\n* [[Timothy Busfield]] as Mark\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park]] as Dee, Mark's wife\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as [[Moonlight Graham|Dr. Archibald \"Moonlight\" Graham]]\n** [[Frank Whaley]] as young Archibald Graham\n* [[Dwier Brown]] as John Kinsella\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Beulah Gasnick\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as [[Buck Weaver]] (3B)\n* [[Steve Eastin]] as [[Eddie Cicotte]] (P)\n* Charles Hoyes as [[Swede Risberg]] (C)\n* [[Art LaFleur]] as [[Chick Gandil]] (1B)\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Anne Seymour (actress)|Anne Seymour]], who died four months before the film's release, makes her final film appearance as the kindly Chisholm publisher who helps Ray and Mann.

Some believe it is Costner or Liotta, but the book's author [[W. P. Kinsella]] said he was told it was [[Ed Harris]] (Madigan's husband).

Lawrence Gordon worked for [[20th Century Fox]], part of the time as its president, and repeatedly mentioned that the book should be adapted into a film, but the studio always turned down the suggestion because they felt the project was too esoteric and noncommercial. Meanwhile, Robinson went ahead with his script, frequently consulting Kinsella for advice on the adaptation. Lawrence Gordon left Fox in 1986 and started pitching the adaptation to other studios. [[Universal Pictures]] accepted the project in 1987 and hired [[USC Trojans baseball|USC]] coach [[Rod Dedeaux]] as baseball advisor. Dedeaux brought along [[World Series]] champion and USC alumnus [[Don Buford]] to coach the actors.<ref name=scrap/>\n\nThe film was shot using the novel's title; eventually, an executive decision was made to rename it ''Field of Dreams.'' Robinson did not like the name, saying he loved ''Shoeless Joe,'' and that the new title was better suited for one about dreams deferred. Kinsella told Robinson after the fact that his original title for the book had been ''The Dream Field'' and that the publisher had imposed the title ''Shoeless Joe''.<ref>{{cite news |first= Nina J. |last= Easton |date= April 21, 1989 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-21/entertainment/ca-2279_1_ray-kinsella-dreams-baseball-movie/2 |title= Diamonds Are Forever : Director Fields the Lost Hopes of Adolescence |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date= March 19, 2015 |archive-date= November 5, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131105232411/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-21/entertainment/ca-2279_1_ray-kinsella-dreams-baseball-movie/2 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nRobinson and the producers did not originally consider [[Kevin Costner]] for the part of Ray Kinsella because they did not think that he would want to follow ''[[Bull Durham]]'' with another baseball film. The role of Ray was first offered to [[Tom Hanks]] but he turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shortlist.com/news/20-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-field-of-dreams|title = 20 Things You (Probably) Didn't Know About Field of Dreams|date = August 17, 2014}}</ref> He did, however, end up reading the script and became interested in the project, stating that he felt it would be \"this generation's ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''\". Since Robinson's directing debut ''[[In the Mood (film)|In the Mood]]'' had been a commercial failure, Costner also said that he would help him with the production. [[Amy Madigan]], a fan of the book, joined the cast as Ray's wife, Annie. In the book, the writer Ray seeks out its real-life author [[J.D. Salinger]]. When Salinger threatened the production with a lawsuit if his name was used, Robinson decided to rewrite the character as reclusive Terence Mann. He wrote with [[James Earl Jones]] in mind because he thought it would be fun to see Ray trying to kidnap such a big man. Robinson had originally envisioned Shoeless Joe Jackson as being played by an actor in his 40s, someone who would be older than Costner and who could thereby act as a father surrogate. [[Ray Liotta]] did not fit that criterion, but Robinson thought he would be a better fit for the part because he had the \"sense of danger\" and ambiguity which Robinson wanted in the character. The role of Moonlight Graham was offered to [[James Stewart]] but he turned it down.<ref name=\"variety.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/field-of-dreams-30th-anniversary-kevin-costner-1203192967/|title='Field of Dreams' Turns 30: Why the Baseball Classic Still Holds a Special Place in America's Hearts (And Heartland)|date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> [[Burt Lancaster]] had originally turned down the part of Moonlight Graham, but changed his mind after a friend, who was also a baseball fan, told him that he had to work on the film.<ref name=scrap>{{cite AV media |chapter= The 'Field of Dreams' Scrapbook |title= Field of Dreams |medium= DVD }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}<!--If this is from a printed booklet, switch to \"cite AV media notes\".--></ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on May 25, 1988. The shooting schedule was built around Costner's availability because he would be leaving in August to film ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]''. Except for some weather delays and other time constraints, production rolled six days a week. The interior scenes were the first ones shot because the cornfield planted by the filmmakers was taking too long to grow. Irrigation had to be used to quickly grow the corn to Costner's height. Primary shot locations were in [[Dubuque County, Iowa]]; [[Field of Dreams (Dubuque County, Iowa)|a farm]] near [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]] was used for the Kinsella home; an empty warehouse in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] was used to build various interior sets. [[Galena, Illinois]], served as Moonlight Graham's [[Chisholm, Minnesota]].<ref name=\"scrap\" /> One week was spent on location shots in [[Boston]], most notably [[Fenway Park]].<ref>{{cite AV media |chapter= Production Notes |title= Field of Dreams |medium= DVD }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}<!--If this is from a printed booklet, switch to \"cite AV media notes\".--></ref>\n\nRobinson, despite having a sufficient budget as well as the cast and crew he wanted, constantly felt tense and depressed during filming. He felt that he was under too much pressure to create an outstanding film, and that he was not doing justice to the original novel. Lawrence Gordon convinced him that the end product would be effective.<ref name=scrap/>\n\nDuring a lunch with the Iowa Chamber of Commerce, Robinson broached his idea of a final scene in which headlights could be seen for miles along the horizon. The Chamber folks replied that it could be done and the shooting of the final scene became a community event. The film crew was hidden on the farm to make sure the aerial shots did not reveal them. A [[production assistant]] drove from the set into town and measured the distance between, deducing it would require 1,500 cars to fill the shot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-morning-briefing-20190624-story.html|title = Morning Briefing: Who was the voice in 'Field of Dreams'?| website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date = June 24, 2019}}</ref> Dyersville was then blacked out and local extras drove their vehicles to the field.

Robinson had created a [[temp track]] which was disliked by Universal executives. When the announcement of Horner as composer was made, the executives felt more positive because they expected a big orchestral score, similar to Horner's work for ''[[An American Tail]]''. Horner, in contrast, liked the temporary score, finding it \"quiet and kind of ghostly\". He decided to follow the idea of the temp track, creating an atmospheric soundtrack which would \"focus on the emotions\".<ref name=scrap/> The score was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] but lost to the [[Alan Menken]] score for ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''.<ref name=oscars>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1990/1?ref_=ttawd_ev_1|title = Academy Awards, USA (1990)| website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref> In addition to Horner's score, portions of several pop songs are heard during the film. They are listed in the following order in the closing credits:\n* \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\", written by [[Willie Nelson]] and performed by [[Beverly D'Angelo]]\n* \"[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]\", written by [[John Sebastian]] and performed by [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]\n* \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\", written by [[Dickey Betts]] and performed by [[the Allman Brothers Band]]\n* \"[[China Grove (song)|China Grove]]\", written by [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]] and performed by [[the Doobie Brothers]]\n* \"Lotus Blossom\", written by [[Billy Strayhorn]] and performed by [[Duke Ellington]]\n\n==Historical connections==\nThe character played by Burt Lancaster and Frank Whaley, [[Moonlight Graham|Archibald \"Moonlight\" Graham]], is based on an actual baseball player with the same name. His character is largely true to life except for a few factual liberties taken for artistic reasons. For instance, the real Graham's lone major league game occurred in June 1905,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/G/Pgrahm101.htm |title= Moonlight Graham |publisher= Retrosheet.org |access-date= June 5, 2010 |archive-date= September 24, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145244/http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/G/Pgrahm101.htm |url-status= live }}</ref> rather than on the final day of the 1922 season. The real Graham died in 1965, as opposed to 1972 as the film depicts. In the film, Terence Mann interviews a number of people about Graham. The DVD special points out that the facts they gave him were taken from articles written about the real man.\n\n==Release==\nUniversal scheduled ''Field of Dreams'' to open in the U.S. on April 21, 1989. The film debuted in just a few theaters and was gradually released to more screens so that it would have a spot among the summer blockbusters. It ended up playing until December.<ref name=scrap/> The film was released in the Philippines by Eastern Films on November 1, 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Your Dreams Will Come True Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19891101&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=January 3, 2019|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publishing, Inc.|date=November 1, 1989|page=27|quote=Due to Insistent Public Demand We're Opening Today!}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10.
