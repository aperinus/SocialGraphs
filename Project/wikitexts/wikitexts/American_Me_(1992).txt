Is Montoya Santana Based on Real Life Gangster?|url=https://thecinemaholic.com/is-american-me-based-on-a-true-story/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=The Cinemaholic|language=en-US}}</ref> Executive producers included record producer [[Lou Adler]], screenwriter Mutrux, and Irwin Young. It depicts a fictionalized account of the founding and rise to power of the [[Mexican Mafia]] in the [[California]] [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|prison system]] from the 1950s into the 1980s.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts 30 years of [[Chicano]] gang life in [[Los Angeles]]. The story opens up with the [[Zoot Suit Riots]] of 1943, depicting a young Latino couple Esperanza and Pedro Santana being racially targeted by sailors. Pedro is taken out to the streets and beaten alongside other Latin-Americans having their clothing ripped and torn, while Esperanza is gang raped by the sailors. The story transitions to years later in 1959 and focuses on the Santana family's eldest son Montoya, a teen who forms a gang along with his friends J.D. and Mundo. They soon find themselves committing crimes and are arrested.\n\nIn juvenile hall, Santana murders a fellow inmate who had raped him, and as a result has his sentence extended into [[Folsom State Prison]] after he turns 18.\n\nYears later, Santana has becomes the leader of a powerful prison gang, [[La Eme]]. Upon his release in 1977, he tries to relate his life experiences to the society that has changed so much since he left. La Eme has become a feared criminal organization beyond Folsom, selling drugs and committing murder. Santana begins a romantic relationship with a woman named Julie, but she becomes repulsed by his violent tendencies and La Eme's negative influence on their community. This becomes evident when a drug lord (who refused to give control of distribution to La Eme) retaliates against them when they take things too far, and have \u201cPuppet\u201d (assisted by other members) brutally rape and murder his son in prison to send a message. The drug lord targets Santana's community by distributing pure heroin to local users which leads to mass overdoses, including Julie's young brother. Santana visits his mother's grave, where Pedro reveals he always resented him because he might have been the result of the rape of his mother, thereby serving as a constant reminder of his mother's ordeal.\n\nSantana starts to see the error of his ways, but before he can take action he is sent back to Folsom for drug possession. When J.D. visits, Santana tells him that he is no longer interested in leading La Eme. However, following a precedent set by Santana himself earlier in the film, his men, including Mundo, murder him to show the other prison gangs that despite having no leader La Eme is not weak, and will not tolerate anyone leaving the gang. He is fatally stabbed and thrown off the balcony to his death. Elsewhere Puppet is released from prison and picked up by his little brother and fellow gang member \u201cLittle Puppet\u201d. As they make a stop to urinate, Little Puppet mentions he has a baby on the way, but as he tells his older brother, Puppet then reluctantly strangles him to death, having been ordered to since Little Puppet was openly disrespectful towards La Eme following his own release from prison earlier.\n\nJulie receives a letter from Santana thanking her for opening his eyes and his necklace of [[St. Dismas]]. Julie gives the necklace to Santana's teen brother Paulito, who then inducts a young boy into La Eme by having them commit a [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by]] shooting.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Montoya Santana, based on Rudy \"Cheyenne\" Cadena, a notorious La Eme mob boss. Cheyenne died in 1972 after being stabbed to death by members of the Mexican Mafia's bitter rival, Nuestra Familia.\n**[[Panchito Gomez]] as Young Montoya Santana\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as J.D, based on [[Joe \"Pegleg\" Morgan]]. Morgan became a member of the Mexican Mafia in 1968 while doing time in San Quentin State prison. He died in 1993 due to cancer.\n**Steve Wilcox as Young J.D.\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as \"Mundo\", based on Ramon \"Mundo\" Mendoza. According to 'Mundo', he was not a founding member of La eMe and he didn't become a member shortly after his arrival to San Quentin State prison in 1968. He went on to add further he never even murdered 'Cheyenne' Cadena after he saw the film's depiction.\n**Richard Coca as Young \"Mundo\"\n* Daniel A. Haro as \"Huero\".

Whether as retaliation over their depiction in the film, or as a routine criminal racket, Mexican Mafia member [[Joe \"Pegleg\" Morgan]], who served as the inspiration for the character of J.D.,<ref name=\":0\" /> allegedly attempted to extort money from Olmos. Court documents show that Olmos was a victim in one extortion count contained in a 33-count federal [[indictment]]. According to reportage by CBS News weekly ''[[60 Minutes]]'', three consultants on this film were later murdered because of the depiction of a homosexual rape scene which offended the Mexican Mafia gangsters' [[machismo]].<ref>Lombardi, John.
