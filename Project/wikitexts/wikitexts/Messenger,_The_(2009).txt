It is the directorial debut of [[Oren Moverman]], who also wrote the screenplay with [[Alessandro Camon]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival]] and was in competition at the [[59th Berlin International Film Festival]] where it won the Silver Bear for Best Screenplay and the Berlinale Peace Film Award '09. The film received first prize for the 2009 [[Deauville American Film Festival]]. The film has also received four [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations (including one win), a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination, and two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations.\n\n==Plot==\nOn leave from the [[Iraq War]], Will Montgomery, a [[U.S. Army]] [[staff sergeant]], finds that his girlfriend Kelly is engaged to another man. Before he is to be discharged, he is dispatched as a [[Casualty Notification|casualty notification officer]] along with [[Gulf War]] veteran Captain Tony Stone as his mentor. He is told of the importance of his task by Lieutenant Colonel Dorsett as many have failed. Stone then relays the rules of telling next of kin of a tragedy. On the job, their first report to the family prompts the mother to slap Stone, as she and his pregnant fianc\u00e9 weep over the deceased; a man named Dale Martin angrily throws things at Will; a woman who secretly married an enlisted man cries in his arms after learning of the man's death; a Mexican man who is told through a translator about the death of his daughter cries in front of his other child; and a woman named Olivia is in considerably less visible pain after learning of her husband's death. Stone suspects it is due to her having an affair.\n\nIn a bar, Will and Stone discuss their lives to each other. Will talks about his girlfriend rejecting him and tells Stone about his father's death due to drunk driving, along with tales of his estranged mother. Will sees Olivia with her son at a mall buying clothes for her husband's funeral, breaking up a fight between her and two Army recruiters attempting to enlist teenagers, before offering her a ride. He fixes her car and becomes friends with both her and her young son Matt. After hearing a voicemail from Kelly talking about her upcoming wedding, he punches a hole through his wall in a fit of rage. He arrives at Olivia's house and the two express affection for each other, but his attempts at [[physical intimacy]] are met with hesitancy as she tells him about how her husband mistreated her and her son.\n\nWhen Will comforts a family in a local grocery store after telling them of their son's fate, Stone physically berates him for it. Will stands up to his rank by using his first name \"Tony\"  before walking home on his own. They later make up and spend the next few days together, where Stone has a hookup and unsuccessfully tries to get Will to do the same. They end up at Kelly's wedding drunk and make a scene, fight in a parking lot, then wake up in a forest after passing out and go home. Martin is there, and he apologizes for lashing out at Will. In Tony's apartment, Will tells Tony about his experience with a friend who died while fighting in Iraq - an event that resulted in his chronic damage to his left eye - and how he feels his bravery was meaningless as he could not do anything for him; he contemplated suicide soon after, but stopped himself when he saw the sunrise. Hearing this, Tony breaks down in tears.\n\nThe next day, Olivia decides to move from her house. She tells Will that she is going with her son to [[Louisiana]]; Will tells her he is considering staying in the army. He asks Olivia to let him know their new address; she asks him to come with her into the house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as SSG Will Montgomery\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as CPT Tony Stone\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Olivia Pitterson\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Kelly\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Dale Martin\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Monica Washington\n* [[Eamonn Walker]] as LTC Stuart Dorsett\n* [[Peter Francis James]] as Dr. Grosso\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Lara\n* [[Gaius Charles]] as Recruiter Brown\n* [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Recruiter Olson\n* [[Carl Anthony Payne II]] as Pitterson's father\n* [[Halley Feiffer]] as Marla Cohen\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as Mr. Cohen\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as returning soldier\n* [[Fiona Dourif]] as returning soldier's wife\n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Alan\n\n==Production==\n''The Messenger'' marked the directorial debut of Israeli screenwriter and former journalist [[Oren Moverman]].
