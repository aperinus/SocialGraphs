While undercover, Kimble discovers a passion for teaching he never knew he had, and considers changing his profession to become an educator. [[Pamela Reed]] plays his partner, Phoebe O'Hara, and [[Penelope Ann Miller]] plays Joyce, the teacher who becomes his love interest. The original music score was composed by [[Randy Edelman]]. The film was released in the United States on December 21, 1990, and grossed $202 million worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|title=Kindergarten Cop|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kindergartencop.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref> A direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Kindergarten Cop 2]]'', was released in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter years of pursuing Cullen Crisp, an infamous drug dealer, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective John Kimble arrests him for murder; a witness saw Crisp murder an informant after getting information regarding the whereabouts of his former wife, Rachel, who he claims stole millions of dollars from him before fleeing with his son, Cullen, Jr. Partnered with former teacher-turned-detective Phoebe O'Hara, Kimble goes undercover in [[Astoria, Oregon]], to find Rachel and offer her immunity in exchange for testifying against Crisp in court. O'Hara is tasked with finding Rachel through her son by acting as a substitute teacher in a [[kindergarten]] class at Astoria Elementary School. However, she is incapacitated by a severe [[stomach flu]], so Kimble takes her place.\n\nThe suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced Kimble will not last long before quitting. Though initially overwhelmed, he adapts to his new status quickly, despite not having any formal teaching experience. With the use of his pet [[ferret]] as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class, and his experience as a father, he becomes a much admired and cherished figure to the students.\n\nKimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. At one point, he deals with a case of child abuse by assaulting and threatening the father of the abused child, winning Miss Schlowski's favor. She assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble also becomes fond of Joyce, a fellow teacher whose son Dominic is one of his students. She is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, telling Dominic that he lives in [[France]]. Conversing with the gradually more trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel and that Dominic is Cullen, Jr. Back in California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. Crisp is subsequently released from prison, and quickly travels to Astoria with Eleanor to search for Dominic.\n\nWhen Kimble learns Crisp has been released, he confronts Rachel about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. She is outraged that he misled her, but she tells him that Crisp lied about her stealing money from him, to convince drug dealers to help him find her. Crisp's real reason for searching for her was to find his son, as he was irritated that Rachel disappeared with him.\n\nCrisp starts a fire in the library as a distraction to kidnap his son, then uses the boy as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Just as Crisp declares his intention to take his son away and prepares to shoot Kimble, Kimble's ferret, which was hiding in Dominic's sweater, bites Crisp in the neck, allowing Dominic to escape. In pain, Crisp wildly shoots at Kimble, hitting him in the leg; Kimble then fatally shoots Crisp. Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering Crisp dead. She shoots Kimble in the shoulder and demands he tell her where Dominic is, but O'Hara appears and knocks Eleanor unconscious with a baseball bat. Eleanor is then arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, with both of them making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles while Kimble decides to resign, staying in Astoria to become a kindergarten teacher at the school full time. Joyce joins him and the two share a kiss while everyone cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- top billed in closing credits order --->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Detective John Kimble \n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Joyce Palmieri / Rachel Myatt Crisp\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Detective Phoebe O'Hara\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Miss Schlowski\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Jillian \n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Cullen Crisp\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Eleanor Crisp \n* [[Christian and Joseph Cousins]] as Dominic Palmieri / Cullen Crisp, Jr.\n* [[Park Overall]] as Samantha's Mother\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Zach's Mother\n* [[Heidi Swedberg]] as Joshua's Mother\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Captain Salazar\n* [[Bob Nelson (comedian)|Bob Nelson]] as Henry Shoop\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Stewardess\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emma\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Joseph\n* [[Benjamin Diskin|Ben Diskin]] as Sylvester\n* [[Adam Wylie]] as Larry\n* [[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]] as Rosa\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n[[Bill Murray]] and [[Patrick Swayze]] were approached to play the role of Kimble.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Bradford |date=17 February 2011 |title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray |archive-date=20 May 2015 |access-date=25 May 2015 |website=Splitsider}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |date=21 December 2015 |title=17 Facts About 'Kindergarten Cop' For Its 25th Anniversary |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72743/17-facts-about-kindergarten-cop-its-25th-anniversary |website=[[Mental Floss]]}}</ref> [[Danny DeVito]] was also considered for the role, but Ivan Reitman nixed the idea due to the actor's height.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 September 2011 |title=The Lost Roles of Danny DeVito |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-danny-devito.html |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref>\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned more than 2,000 children for the roles of the students.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news | first=Susan | last=King | title=Ivan Reitman, 'Kindergarten Cop's' Top Sergeant | work=The Los Angeles Times | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | access-date=December 2, 2010 | date=December 21, 1990 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210549/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-7037_1_kindergarten-cop | archive-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> [[Elijah Wood]] unsuccessfully auditioned for a role.<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://play.acast.com/s/mydadwroteaporno/footnotes-elijah-wood |title=Footnotes: Elijah Wood |website=[[My Dad Wrote a Porno]] |publisher=[[Acast]] |date=July 6, 2016 |access-date=August 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nExterior scenes at Astoria Elementary School were filmed at John Jacob Astor Elementary School, located at 3550 Franklin Avenue in [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Universal Studios]] hired local artists Judith Niland and Carl Lyle Jenkins to paint murals on the walls at Astoria, and provided new playground equipment, a fenced playground, and a new lawn and hedges around the school.
