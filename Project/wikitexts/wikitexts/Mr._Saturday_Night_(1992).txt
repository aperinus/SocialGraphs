Crystal produced and co-wrote the screenplay with the writing duo [[Babaloo Mandel]] and [[Lowell Ganz]].  It was filmed from November 1991 to March 1992 and released on September 23, 1992, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. Co-star [[David Paymer]] received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nStand-up comedian Buddy Young Jr. became a television star with the help of his brother and manager, Stan, but alienated many of those closest to him once his career began to fade.\n\nThrough a series of flashbacks, the brothers are seen during childhood entertaining their family in the living room. The older Buddy continues his career as a comic in [[Catskill Mountains|the Catskills]], where he meets his future wife, Elaine.\n\nAs Buddy's fame grows, so does his ego. He hits the big time with his own Saturday night television show. But despite the warnings of his brother, Buddy uses offensive material on the air, costing him his show and causing his career to suffer, officially ending when his stand-up act on the [[Ed Sullivan Show]] is scheduled right after [[the Beatles]]' first US appearance, leading to his act being ignored and cut short. Furious over being snubbed, he goes into an offensive tirade and quits.\n\nAs an older man, long past his prime, Buddy is estranged from Stan as well as from his daughter, Susan. A chance at redemption comes when a young agent named Annie Wells finds him work and even gets Buddy a shot at a role in a top director's new film. Buddy nevertheless gives in to his own self-destructive nature, continuing to hurt his relationships with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Buddy Young Jr.\n* [[David Paymer]] as Stan Young\n* [[Julie Warner]] as Elaine Young\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Annie Wells\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Phil Gussman\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Larry Meyerson\n* [[Mary Mara]] as Susan Young\n\n===Cameos===\nComedians [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Carl Ballantine]], [[Slappy White]], and [[Jackie Gayle]] appear in the [[New York Friars' Club]] scene.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe opening title sequence was designed by [[Elaine Makatura Bass]] and [[Saul Bass]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Mr. Saturday Night'' received mixed reviews from critics.
