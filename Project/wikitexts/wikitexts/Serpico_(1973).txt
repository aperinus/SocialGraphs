The screenplay was adapted by [[Waldo Salt]] and [[Norman Wexler]] from the book of the same name written by [[Peter Maas]] with the assistance of its subject, [[Frank Serpico]]. The story details Serpico's struggle with corruption within the [[New York City Police Department]] during his eleven years of service, and his work as a [[whistleblower]] that led to the investigation by the [[Knapp Commission]].\n\nProducer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] purchased the rights from Maas. Agent [[Martin Bregman]] joined the film as co-producer. Bregman suggested Pacino for the main part, and [[John G. Avildsen]] was hired to direct the film. Pacino met with Serpico to prepare for the role early in the summer of 1973. After Avildsen was dismissed, Lumet was hired as his replacement. On a short notice, he selected the shooting locations and organized the scenes; the production was filmed in July and August.\n\nUpon its release, ''Serpico'' became a critical and commercial success. At the same time, the film drew criticism from police officers. It received nominations for the [[Academy Awards]] and [[BAFTA Awards]]. Pacino earned the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]], while Salt and Wexler received the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Officer [[Frank Serpico]] is rushed to the hospital, having been shot in the face. Chief Sidney Green fears that Serpico was shot by another cop. The rest of the film is shown as a long [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nSerpico graduates from the police academy with big ideas for improving the police force's community relations. He dresses like an actual civilian instead of wearing the department's standard plainclothes dress, which is easily recognizable. While he is chasing a burglar, other officers fail to recognize him as one of their own, and shoot at him. He realizes that deviating from protocols can be dangerous.\n\nSerpico reports an attempted bribe to a high-ranking investigator, who chuckles and advises him to keep the money. Serpico soon learns that corruption is rampant in the police department. Forced to accompany officers as they collect payoffs from criminals and small businesses, Serpico refuses to accept his share of the money. He makes several attempts to alert superiors to the corruption but is rebuffed every time. Other officers learn that he is reporting them and he begins to fear for his life.\n\nSerpico and his well-connected friend Blair go to the mayor's assistant, who promises a real investigation and support but is stymied by political pressure. Ostracized, frustrated, and fearful, Serpico sinks into depression, which ruins his relationship with his girlfriend. He begins brutalizing well-connected suspects who had been bribing other officers and thought themselves protected. Finally, Serpico informs McClain that he has reported his experiences to oversight agencies outside the police force. Furious, McClain informs the other officers.\n\nBlair uses his connections to arrange a personal interview with the district attorney, who tell Serpico that if he testifies to a grand jury, a major investigation will follow. The DA limits his questions and prevents Serpico from revealing the ubiquity of corruption in the police force. Serpico and Blair take their story to ''[[The New York Times]]''. After his allegations are printed, his superiors retaliate by assigning him to a dangerous narcotics squad in Brooklyn.\n\nDuring a raid on a drug trafficker's apartment, Serpico's partners hold back at a critical moment and Serpico gets shot in the face. After a long, painful recovery, he testifies before the [[Knapp Commission]], a government inquiry into NYPD corruption. An epilogue states that Frank Serpico resigned from the NYPD on June 15, 1972, was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal of Honor|NYPD Medal of Honor]] for \"conspicuous bravery in action\", and moved to Switzerland.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective [[Frank Serpico]]\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Chief Sidney Green\n* [[Jack Kehoe]] as Tom Keough\n* [[Biff McGuire]] as Captain Inspector McClain\n* Barbara Eda-Young as Laurie\n* Cornelia Sharpe as Leslie\n* [[Edward Grover]] as Inspector Lombardo\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Bob Blair\n* [[Allan Rich]] as District Attorney Herman Tauber\n* [[Albert Henderson (actor)|Albert Henderson]] as Peluce\n* [[Joseph Bova]] as Potts\n* [[Alan North]] as Brown\n* [[Woodie King Jr.]] as Larry\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Lieutenant Steiger\n* [[Bernard Barrow]] as Inspector Roy Palmer\n* [[Nathan George]] as Lieutenant Nate Smith\n* [[M.

Early negotiations included [[Paul Newman]] in the role of Durk, and [[Robert Redford]] as Serpico.{{sfn|Levy, Shawn|2010|p=450}} Serpico distanced himself from the project, as he felt that he would be merely portrayed as a [[sidekick]].{{sfn|Conlon, Edward|2012|p=252}} Script writer [[John Gregory Dunne]] turned down the project, as he felt \"there was no story\". Director [[Sam Peckinpah]], as well as Newman and Redford left the project.{{sfn|Dunne, John Gregory|2013|p=182}}\n\nAfter the success of several of his films in the 1960s, and the first years of the 1970s, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] decided to move from Italy to the United States. The change in financing laws further regulated the Italian film industry, and the producer settled in New York City. Following their collaboration on ''[[The Valachi Papers (film)|The Valachi Papers]]'', De Laurentiis purchased the rights to Maas' book.{{sfn|Morton, Ray|2005|p=149}} Maas received US$400,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.4|1973|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) and participation in the film, while the rights for his work were secured before the March 1973 publication of the book.{{sfn|AFI Staff|2019}} Initially, De Laurentiis' found resistance to the project from [[Paramount Pictures]]. The studio considered that \"enough cop movies\" had been made.{{sfn|De Laurentiis, Dino; Kezich, Tulio; Levantesi, Alessandra|2004|p=206}} In turn, De Laurentiis was supported by [[Charles Bluhdorn]], president of [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]] who wanted the film to be made.{{sfn|De Laurentiis, Dino; Kezich, Tulio; Levantesi, Alessandra|2004|p=201}} De Laurentiis later declared that \"no American producer would have had the courage\" to depict police corruption in a motion picture.{{sfn|De Laurentiis, Dino; Kezich, Tulio; Levantesi, Alessandra|2004|p=206}}\n\nMaas' agent, [[Sam Cohn]], was approached by agent [[Martin Bregman]]. Bregman expressed his interest to also produce the film after reading an article in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine about the book. Bregman proposed one of his signed actors, [[Al Pacino]] to play the lead.{{sfn|Prigg\u00e9, Steven|2004|p=119}} [[Waldo Salt]] was chosen to write the screenplay adaptation. The first draft did not impress Maas, De Laurentiis, nor Bregman. Bregman felt that the result was \"very political\", and that the story did not reflect what the producers desired to portray on the film. Bregman and Maas then directed Salt to the parts of the book they envisioned to be reflected on the screenplay. The second draft was considered a substantial improvement by the production team.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=77}} Bregman took the [[Film treatment|treatment]] to Pacino, who initially did not find the film interesting. Salt then visited Pacino with the re-worked script, that convinced him to consider the part.{{sfn|Grobel, Lawrence|2006|p=32}} A meeting with Serpico, Maas and Pacino was then arranged for the actor to meet the subject of the film. Upon meeting him, Pacino was fully convinced to accept the part.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=76}} [[John G.

They had previously worked together in Avildsen's ''[[Joe (1970 film)|Joe]]''. Both then traveled to Switzerland, to visit Serpico at home, and work the details.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=78}} Time to work on the production was constricted due to Pacino's commitment to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Further disagreement arose between Avildsen and Bregman regarding the script, and then the selection of the filming locations. Upon finding resistance to his plans, Avildsen threatened Bregman of quitting multiple times. An aggravated Bregman then called for a meeting with the production team, in order to cause the director to quit in front of witnesses. Avildsen had insisted on a meeting with Bregman and De Laurentiis to shoot a scene in the real home of Serpico's parents for authenticity. The producers felt that the structure could not accommodate the production team and equipment efficiently.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=78}} The escalating tension on the meeting resulted in De Laurentiis firing Avildsen, and the director quit in return.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=79}} Avildsen's account for the reason of his dismissal was refusing to cast Cornelia Sharpe as Leslie. Sharpe was at the time dating Bregman. Avildsen would later declare that he should have treated the situation \"with more finesse\".{{sfn|Powell, Larry; Garrett, Tom|2013|p=53}} [[Sidney Lumet]] was then hired to complete the job for his reputation as an effective director under a tight schedule.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=79}}\n\nPacino was shortly distracted from the project by an offer to play the lead in ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'', but ultimately he turned it down.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=77}} To prepare for ''Serpico'', he rode with police officers for a night, but he decided it was not enough. A [[method acting|method actor]], he felt that he needed to spend time with Serpico.{{sfn|Grobel, Lawrence|2006|p=32}} Pacino and Serpico met several times in [[Montauk, New York]], where the actor rented a house for the summer season. Pacino was moved by Serpico's conviction to reform the NYPD, and became more committed to the project.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=76}} In character, Pacino often walked through areas of the city that were considered dangerous at the time.{{sfn|Scorsese, Martin|2006|p=60}} While waiting in traffic, he attempted to arrest a truck driver, as he was enraged by the exhaust fumes.{{sfn|Grobel, Lawrence|2006|p=39}} He was refused service at a Manhattan restaurant for the appearance he kept for the film.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}}\n\n==Production==\nLumet organized the 107 speaking parts that took place in 104 different locations.{{sfn|Cunningham, Frank|2014|p=216}} The longest scenes took up two-and-a-half pages of the screenplay, while the average was one page.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=34}} A budget of $3.3 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.3|1973|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) was assigned.{{sfn|Knoedelseder, William Jr.|1987|p=2 (partIV)}} Two weeks of rehearsal were held. Pacino had learned Salt's screenplay, and he agreed with Lumet that Wexler's revised version improved the structure, but that the dialogue was impoverished.{{sfn|Spiegel, Maura|2019|p=160}} Lumet allowed the actors to improvise certain dialogues, and he also allowed their creative input for the scenes.{{sfn|Cunningham, Frank|2014|p=216}} The cast selected dialogues from both scripts as the filming progressed.{{sfn|Spiegel, Maura|2019|p=160}} Though he had already a good knowledge of New York locations, Lumet considered the work \"physically brutal, and emotionally tough\".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}} The principal photography on ''Serpico'' began in early July 1973. The film was planned to be released before Christmas, with four-and-a-half months for the crew to complete the movie.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2020}} Filming took place in July and August.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=33}} The story of the film encompassed eleven years, from 1960 through 1971.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=30}}\n\n[[File:Pacino as Serpico in 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Pacino as Frank Serpico in a publicity portrait]]\nTo accommodate the scenes around Pacino's facial hair, the film was shot in reverse. Pacino started with long beard and hair. He was shaved to a mustache, and then eventually his hair was cut, and he was clean-shaven for the beginning of the film.{{sfn|Spiegel, Maura|2019|p=160}} Lumet decided each day if Pacino was to be further shaven, and the crew prepared fake beards in case they were required.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=31}} Winter conditions were simulated, as the team had to defoliate trees and cut shrubs.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=31}} Special make-up was used to absorb the sweat, and to keep the actors' skin dry.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|1973|p=7-C}} The cast wore winter coats, and their skin was made to look bluish, while their breath had to be visible.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=31}} The director followed Serpico's desire for the winter to look \"cold and heavy\", and the summer \"idyllic and hazy\".{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=33}} The team had difficulty to find locations suitable for the scenes set in the 1960s, since graffiti did not become common until 1970.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=30}} Lumet shot up to thirty-five different setups daily.{{sfn|Cunningham, Frank|2014|p=216}} The team had to move three times a day on an average. Each location had to be cleared of cars that did not belong to the particular period, and extras could not feature long hair, or non-period wardrobe. Hairdressers were present with the crew.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=31}} Multiple locations in the city including [[Harlem]], [[South Bronx]], [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] and [[Astoria, Queens]] were used.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}} [[Lewisohn Stadium]] was featured shortly before its demolition.{{sfn|Harlem World Magazine staff|2019}} The party scene was shot at [[Sidney Kingsley]]'s fifth avenue loft.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}} The NYPD cooperated with the director, and allowed him to film in four active police stations.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}}\n\nSerpico's apartment had to be built by the crew. It featured a fixed ceiling, and movable walls.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=32}} As Serpico's original apartment, it was located in [[Greenwich Village]].{{sfn|Schoell, William|1995|p=74}} Through lighting, Lumet and cinematographer [[Arthur Ornitz]] chose to maintain a \"warm look\" on the location. Different techniques were used to reflect moods, and the changes that the character went through the years.{{sfn|Sharples, Win Jr.|1974|p=33}} Lumet focused on portraying Serpico's struggle to balance his work and personal life, and his increased isolation and alienation, as his efforts produced slow results.{{sfn|Cunningham, Frank|2014|p=217}} The director decided to portray him \"darker and darker\". As the film progressed, the cast costumes became darker in color, until the courtroom scene, where all the actors wore dark tones.{{sfn|Schwartz, David|2005}} Lumet told [[Charles Champlin]]: \"I was trying to negate color, to make a picture in color that was not colorful\". Meanwhile, he desired Serpico's fellow officers to be \"men with charm, who were all the more evil for being human and understandable\".{{sfn|Champlin, Charles|1974|p=26}} Lumet finished shooting the film in fifty-one days, on budget.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=80}}\n\nThe film was edited by [[Dede Allen]]. Allen received the scenes from Lumet directly after they were shot. She had a limit of forty-eight hours to finish her work for its delivery to the sound department.{{sfn|Nixon, Rob|2020}} Lumet did not want to add a [[Film score|score]] to the picture, but he decided he would do it before De Laurentiis commissioned one. He learned that [[Mikis Theodorakis]] was released from prison in Greece.{{sfn|Schwartz, David|2005}} He was able to locate him in Paris, as the composer quickly left his country of origin. Theodorakis accepted Lumet's offer, and flew to New York City the next day. He met with the director, who played the movie for him the day of his arrival. Theodorakis agreed that it should not have a soundtrack, but he offered a composition of his to add to the film. Theodorakis had arranged a tour of the United States with a Greek orchestra and told Lumet that he could not be present for the [[Spotting (filmmaking)|spotting session]]. Lumet offered the help of [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]], who would sit with the director for the spotting. To inform of the progress of the sessions and possible changes on the arrangements, James flew to the cities where Theodorakis appeared in order to work the details together.{{sfn|Schwartz, David|2005}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on December 5, 1973 in New York,{{sfn|Kirshner, Jonathan|2012|p=227}} and on December 18 in Los Angeles.{{sfn|AFI Staff|2019}} The opening week in New York garnered $123,000.{{sfn|Variety Staff|1973|p=8}} ''Serpico'' was released nationwide on February 6, 1974.{{sfn|Variety Staff|1974|p=4}} The film was a critical and commercial success.{{sfn|AFI Staff|2019}} It grossed between $23.4 million and $29.8 million.{{sfn|Knoedelseder, William Jr.|1987|p=2}}{{sfn|Box Office Mojo staff|2020}}\n\nSerpico attended the premiere of the film,{{sfn|Spiegel, Maura|2019|p=160}} but he did not finish watching it.{{sfn|Kilgannon, Corey|2010}} Serpico felt \"distant\" from the end results.{{sfn|Kaufman, Michael|1973|p=58}} On an interview with [[Pauline Kael]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he concluded that it \"didn't give a sense of frustration you feel when you're not able to do anything\".{{sfn|Kramer, Carol|1974|p=Weekend 2}} According to Lumet's account, he met Serpico shortly before the production. The director asked him to stay clear of the set, to not make Pacino \"self-conscious\" regarding his portrayal.{{sfn|Spiegel, Maura|2019|p=160}} Serpico watched the film in its entirety for the first time in 2010.{{sfn|Kilgannon, Corey|2010}} In a later interview, he declared that Lumet barred him from the set after he interrupted the shooting of a scene that \"never happened\". Serpico also criticized the dismissal of Avildsen by the production team. Serpico and Avildsen remained friends, and shared a property on [[Long Island]] for three years in the 1980s.{{sfn|D'Ambrosio, Antonino|2017}} [[New York City Police Commissioner]] [[Michael Codd]] stated that the film \"tends to imply that Serpico was the only honest cop in the whole department\".{{sfn|Walter, Greg|1974|p=1-I}} Detective Durk was not pleased with ''Serpico''. Durk, who was depicted in the character of Bob Blair, felt that the movie would deter other policemen to denounce corruption. On an interview with ''The New York Times'', he considered that the movie was unfair to honest police officers. Durk stated that the end of the film conveyed that \"the cost of honesty is martyrdom\", and Serpico's departure for Switzerland showed him \"wounded and frustrated\". Meanwhile, Bronx district attorney [[Burton B. Roberts]] declared that it \"bears absolutely no relationship to the truth\". Lumet defended his [[artistic license]] on the portrayal of the story, as he felt he desired to make a film that \"people believed in\".{{sfn|Kaufman, Michael|1973|p=58}} Bregman dismissed the critics, as he felt that the real names were not relevant for viewers in cities outside New York.{{sfn|Kramer, Carol|1974|p=Weekend 2}} Maas dismissed Durk's claims regarding honest policemen and asked \"where were they?\"{{sfn|McCabe, Bruce|1974|p=14}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n===Premiere reception===\n''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the film was \"galvanizing\" for Pacino's performance, and by the \"tremendous intensity\" of Lumet's direction. The publication considered the film at the same time \"disquieting\" for its use of fictional names, as the reviewer felt that it diminished the role of Durk. Meanwhile, it called Theodorakis' soundtrack \"redundant and dumb\".{{sfn|Canby, Vincent|1973|p=61}} The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' delivered a favorable review of the film. It rated it four stars out of five, and called it \"a triumph of  intelligence, compassion and style\".{{sfn|Oster, Jerry|1973|p=122}} A follow-up critic by the publication deemed Pacino's acting a \"masterful performance\", as the reviewer remarked \"he walks like a cop.

The review also praised Lumet and his \"talent for achieving social realism\".{{sfn|Carroll, Kathleen|1973|p=7}} ''[[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]]'' considered it \"one of the finest films of the year\".
