The film is about a [[theatrical producer|theater producer]] and his accountant who, as part of a scam, decide to stage the worst [[stage musical]] they can create. They find a script centering on [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazis and bring it to the stage. Because of this theme, ''The Producers'' was controversial from the start<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vOeYCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 | title=Hollywood and the Holocaust| isbn=9781442252240| last1=Gonshak| first1=Henry| date=October 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saNvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 |title = Mel Brooks in the Cultural Industries|isbn = 9780748664504|last1 = Symons|first1 = Alex|date = August 6, 2012}}</ref> and received mixed reviews.

It was later adapted by Brooks and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] as a [[The Producers (musical)|stage musical]], which itself was adapted into a [[The Producers (2005 film)|film]].\n\n==Plot==\nMax Bialystock ([[Zero Mostel]]) is an aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy [[Broadway (theater)|Broadway]] [[Theatrical producer|producer]] past his prime who ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for a \"next play\" that may never be produced. Accountant Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom ([[Gene Wilder]]), a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation\u2014a producer can make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. For this same reason, no duped investor will be aware of the many others, thus protecting the pair from charges of fraud. Max instantly puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to [[Rio de Janeiro]] with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his current drab existence is no better than prison.\n\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: ''[[Springtime for Hitler|Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden]].'' It is \"a love letter to Hitler\" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind ([[Kenneth Mars]]). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. To guarantee the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris ([[Christopher Hewett]]), a director whose plays \"close on the first day of rehearsal.\" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent [[flower power]] [[hippie]] named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|L.S.D.]] ([[Dick Shawn]]), who had mistakenly wandered into the theater during the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting call]]. Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors. At the theatre on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic who came to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max's feet. Max and Leo sneak off to a bar across the street to wait for the audience to storm out once they actually see the show.\n\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\", which celebrates [[Nazi Germany]] crushing Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for [[invasion of Poland|Poland]] and [[Fall Rot|France]]\"). The audience is horrified and rises en masse after the number. At this point L.S.D. comes on stage as Hitler, and it is evident from his [[beatnik]]-like portrayal that De Bris has altered the script and directed the play as a [[satire (film and television)|satire]]. Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who\u2014after dropping the curtain and rushing out on stage\u2014confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. To Max and Leo's shock and horror, ''Springtime for Hitler'' is declared a comic smash hit, which means that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.\n\nA gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo, accusing them of breaking the \"[[Hitler Oath|Siegfried Oath]]\". He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life.  Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.\n\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new musical called ''Prisoners of Love'', a show which looks even worse than ''Springtime for Hitler'', mostly because Leo and Max are striving to make a good play instead of a bad one. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam\u2014overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden. The song \"Prisoners of Love\" plays while the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of The Producers characters}}\n* [[Zero Mostel]] as Max Bialystock\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom\n* [[Dick Shawn]] as Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D.)\n* [[Estelle Winwood]] as \"Hold Me!

When imagining what play \"would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over\", Brooks decided to combine Adolf Hitler and a musical.<ref name=guardian /> Brooks, in a 2001 episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'', stated that, while serving in the army, he would be called \"Jew boy\", and lightheartedly admitted that he made ''The Producers'' to \"get even\" with antisemites, particularly [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shales|first=Tom|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2001/04/14/on-60-minutes-springtime-for-mel-brooks/3f3f4d56-ff9c-4fdc-aca8-93197f7bd1e8/|title=On '60 Minutes,' Springtime for Mel Brooks|date=2001-04-14|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2020-04-06|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> In another interview, he further explained his reasoning, stating,\n\n{{blockquote|More than anything the great Holocaust by the Nazis is probably the great outrage of the 20th century.

Glazier laughed so much at Brooks' performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, \"We\u2019re gonna make it! I don't know how, but we're gonna make this movie!\"<ref name=billboard>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87 |title= 'Producers' Producer: The Man Behind a Classic|newspaper= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=White |first=Timothy|date= April 26, 1997|access-date=January 9, 2010|page=87}}</ref>\n\nGlazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist [[Louis Wolfson]], who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator,<ref name=guardian /> and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by [[Joseph E. Levine]] of [[Embassy Pictures]]. Levine's only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> Brooks renamed it ''The Producers,'' considering it [[ironic]] as \"these guys are anything but producers\".<ref name=\"makingof\">{{IMDb title|0425221|The Making of ''The Producers''<nowiki/>}}</ref> As Brooks \"couldn't think of anybody to direct it\", eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before.<ref name=pb75 /> While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a [[stage manager]] in ''[[Your Show of Shows]].''<ref name=makingof /><ref name=billboard />\n\n=== Casting ===\nBrooks wanted [[Zero Mostel|Samuel \"Zero\" Mostel]] as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character.<ref name=makingof /> Glazier sent the script to Mostel's lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel's wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing \"a Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave\", his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.<ref name=vf /><ref name=billboard /> Mostel allowed all his pent-up hostilities towards all the sources of his professional disappointments to spill over into his performance as Bialystock, making his a bitter, hate-filled, and often angry interpretation.\n\nGene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks' then-girlfriend [[Anne Bancroft]] in a stage adaptation of ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]].'' Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was \"a natural comic, you look like [[Harpo Marx]]\", and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> When production arrived, [[Peter Sellers]] accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]].''<ref name=makingof /> Wilder received the script to ''The Producers'' as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]]'', and his co-star [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] was brought for a brief appearance as the actress playing [[Eva Braun]].<ref name=vf />\n\n[[Dustin Hoffman]] was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in ''[[The Graduate]].'' Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred [[Anne Bancroft]] (later Brooks' wife), and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind.<ref name=makingof /> Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in Liebkind's role, which was his film debut and had him remain on the role while not filming as [[method acting]].<ref name=vf /> De Bris was instead portrayed by [[Christopher Hewett]], the first actor who read for the role.<ref name=makingof />\n\nOnce recent [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] graduate [[Lee Meredith]] was invited to audition, she was given the condition of knowing a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role of Ulla with the screen test featuring the scene of her dancing. Bancroft suggested her friend [[Andr\u00e9as Voutsinas]] for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of [[Dick Shawn]] to play Lorenzo \"L.S.D.\" Saint DuBois, and the actor accepted for both liking the part and having no work. Writer-director Mel Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, \"Don't be stupid, be a smarty / Come and join the Nazi Party\", in the song \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime For Hitler]]\". His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for ''The Producers'' began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests.<ref name=guardian /> The primary location was the [[Chelsea Studios]] in [[New York City]], where the musical version (2005) was also shot.<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231 |chapter=Union Square/Gramercy Park/Chelsea |page=231 |title= New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York| first= Richard |last=Alleman | year= 2005 |publisher= Broadway Books | isbn= 9780767916349 |location=New York}}</ref> The now-demolished [[Playhouse Theatre (New York City)|Playhouse Theatre]] hosted the ''Springtime for Hitler'' play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming on such midtown Manhattan locales as [[Central Park]], the [[Empire State Building]], and [[Lincoln Center]].<ref name=vf />\n\nBrooks's lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director [[Michael Hertzberg]].<ref name=pb75 /> Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from ''[[The New York Times]]'', and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel.<ref name=vf /> Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather,<ref name=makingof /> the last scene, filmed at the [[Revson Fountain]] in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist's appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.<ref name=vf />\n\nDespite being described as a lavish production number, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\" was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]] at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number \"big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible\". As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the [[burlesque]] nature of \"Springtime for Hitler\", such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.\n\nFew scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max would visit the [[Parachute Jump]] in [[Coney Island]], but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', accompanied by ''[[The Ride of the Valkyries]]'' and wearing [[horned helmet]]s. But feeling that it \"went overboard\", Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nThe art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color. For the posters in Bialystock's office, production designer [[Charles Rosen]] found a collector in the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] and doctored a few posters to include the character's name.

The film's premiere in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on November 22, 1967,<ref name=\"tcm\">{{tcmdb title|id=87256|title=The Producers}}</ref> was a disaster and the studio considered shelving it. However, relief came when ''Pink Panther'' star [[Peter Sellers]] saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in support of the film's wide release.<ref name=\"makingof\" /><ref name=\"dvdjourn\" /> Sellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers \"had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again\".<ref name=\"makingof\" /><ref name=\"dvdjourn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/p/producers68_de.shtml |title=The Producers (1968): Deluxe Edition |first=Mark |last=Bourne |work=The DVD Journal |access-date=February 21, 2011}}</ref> The film allegedly was \"banned in Germany\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio Times | date=24\u201330 November 2001}}</ref> The film was screened in New York City in March 1968.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/19/archives/screen-the-producers-at-fine-arts.html|title=Screen: 'The Producers' at Fine Arts|work=New York Times|date=March 19, 1968}}</ref> The film's wide release would take place on March 18, 1968.<ref name=wided>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1016819-producers |title=The Producers |website=Rotton Tomatoes |access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the film for the Swedish release uses the translation of the name of the play within the story, ''Springtime for Hitler''.

One of the mixed reviews came from [[Renata Adler]], who, writing for ''[[The New York Times]],'' stated: \"''The Producers'', which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.\" About the acting, she writes that Mostel is \"overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks\" and that, in the role of Max Bialystock, he is \"as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be\". Co-star Wilder fares better and is called \"wonderful\", thanks to doing \"fine\", despite being \"forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel\" and \"[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism\", and playing his part \"as though he were [[Dustin Hoffman]] being played by [[Danny Kaye]]\". She also puts the movie into the bigger context of \"contemporary\" comedy and that it has the same \"episodic, [[revue]] quality\" in the way it is \"not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo\". Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: \"[''The Producers''] is less delicate than [[Lenny Bruce]], less funny than ''[[Dr. Strangelove]],'' but much funnier than ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'' or ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]''\"<ref name=\"nyt68adler\">{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/19/archives/screen-the-producers-at-fine-arts.html | title=Screen: 'The Producers' at Fine Arts| date=March 19, 1968 | author-link= Renata Adler |first=Renata |last=Alder | work= [[The New York Times]] | access-date= May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor,<ref name=\"hoberman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/15/movies/film-when-the-nazis-became-nudniks.html?pagewanted=all| title=FILM; When The Nazis Became Nudniks| first=J. |last=Hoberman| date=April 15, 2001| work=[[The New York Times]]| access-date=February 2, 2007}}</ref> but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about [[Hitler]] only 23 years after the end of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Symons\">{{cite journal|title=An audience for Mel Brooks's The Producers: the avant-garde of the masses |first=Alex |last=Symons |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television |date=March 22, 2006 |volume=34 |pages=24\u201332 |doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.24-32 |s2cid=194073045 |access-date=February 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153713/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Among the most harsh critics were [[Stanley Kauffmann]] in ''[[The New Republic]],'' who wrote that \"the film bloats into sogginess\" and \"Springtime for Hitler&nbsp;... doesn't even rise to the level of tastelessness\", [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] wrote ''The Producers'' \"is a model of how not to make a comedy\",<ref>{{cite book |title=Reverse Angle: A Decade of American Film|url=https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo|url-access=registration|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Crown Publishers Inc. |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo/page/145 145]|isbn=9780517544716}}</ref> and [[Pauline Kael]] who called it \"amateurishly crude\" in ''[[The New Yorker]].''

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's reviewers wrote that the film was \"hilariously funny\" but pointed out that \"the film is burdened with the kind of plot that demands resolution\" but unfortunately \"ends in a whimper of sentimentality\". Although they labelled it \"disjointed and inconsistent\", they also praised it as \"a wildly funny joy ride\", and concluded by saying that \"despite its bad moments, [it] is some of the funniest American cinema comedy in years\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837773-1,00.html |title=The Producers (review) |date=January 26, 1968 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=February 2, 2007}}</ref> The film industry trade paper ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"The film is unmatched in the scenes featuring Mostel and Wilder alone together, and several episodes with other actors are truly rare.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1967/film/reviews/the-producers-4-1200421497/|title=The Producers (review)|date=December 31, 1967|author=Variety Staff|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=February 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the film has gained in stature.

He did not direct the latter, but served as a producer. Unlike the original film, it was not commercially successful.\n\nThis film has spawned several home media releases on VHS, Laserdisc, CED, and VCD from companies such as [[Magnetic Video]], [[Embassy Home Entertainment]], [[PolyGram Video]], Speedy, and Lumiere Video. A 1997 letterbox edition Laserdisc was released by PolyGram Video, which served as the basis for the extremely rare 1998 PolyGram DVD release.\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which owns video rights to select Embassy Pictures titles that ended up with Nelson Entertainment and Polygram, released ''The Producers'' on Region 1 DVD in 2002 and reissued in 2005 to coincide with the remake released that year. In 2013, MGM licensed the title to [[Shout! Factory]] to release a DVD and Blu-ray combo pack with a new HD transfer and newly produced bonus materials. StudioCanal, worldwide rights holder to all of the Embassy Pictures library, has also released several R2 DVD editions using a transfer slightly different from the North American DVD and Blu-Ray releases. In 2018, StudioCanal gave the film its European Blu-Ray debut in the UK, Germany, and Australia. The StudioCanal releases included most extras from the Shout! Factory release as well as a new 4K restoration for a 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Film}}\n* ''[[The Butter and Egg Man]]''\n* ''[[Jojo Rabbit]]''\n* ''[[The Great Dictator]]''\n* {{section link|List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes|Season 4 (2004)|display=List of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' episodes}}\n* [[List of American films of 1967]]\n*[[:Category:American satirical films]]\n* [[Setting up to fail]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*''The Producers'' essay [https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/producers.pdf] by Brian Scott Mednick at [[National Film Registry]]\n*{{AFI film|19896}}\n* {{IMDb title|0063462}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|39399}}\n* {{tcmdb title|87256}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1016819-producers}}\n* ''The Producers'' essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pages [https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_s_Film_Legacy/deq3xI8OmCkC?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizyMChr__qAhVroXIEHQcNAtgQiKUDMBZ6BAgTEAQ]\n\n{{Mel Brooks}}\n{{The Producers}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Producers}}\n[[Category:1960s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1967 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1967 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s satirical films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films about entertainers]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Films about musical theatre]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Morris]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1967]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Jewish comedy and humor]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about Nazis]]\n[[Category:Film controversies]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about fraud]]\n[[Category:1967 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Censored films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
