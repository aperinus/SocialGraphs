The thirty minute [[Christmas special]] was co-written and directed by [[Gary Trousdale]] and produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cody Cameron]], [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] reprise their roles from the feature films. This Christmas special takes place between ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''. As with the other ''Shrek'' animations, this television special was based on the 1990 children's book ''[[Shrek!]]'' by [[William Steig]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] is quietly living in the swamp with his family when the [[Christmas]] season arrives. Under [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]'s urging, Shrek reluctantly promises [[Princess Fiona]] a special Christmas surprise. Shrek goes to the local bookstore in Far Far Away to try to find a present for Fiona, but since he does not know what Christmas is all about, the shopkeeper gives Shrek a copy of ''Christmas For Village Idiots'', a step by step guide to celebrating the holiday. Shrek proceeds to follow the book's advice by decorating the house and getting a tree so he can spend a quiet [[Christmas Eve]] with his family, but Donkey brings the entire \"family\" to the swamp, spoiling Shrek's plans.\n\nAs Shrek tries to recite \"[[The Night Before Christmas|A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\", Gingy, Donkey, and [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] interrupt and each tell their own Christmas story. Donkey tells of a Christmas parade passing by the swamp and licking an enormous waffle [[Santa Claus|Santa]], and absentmindedly starts licking Shrek's foot. Puss's version of the Santa Claus story ends with playing with the tassel on Santa's hat, while in reality he is playing with a bauble. Gingy tells a horrifying story about how his girlfriend Suzy was eaten by Santa Claus. Donkey calls it ridiculous, and finds Shrek's ''Christmas for Village Idiots'' book. A fight breaks out over the book and Shrek's supper is destroyed. After lighting his butt on fire, Shrek finally loses his temper and ends up ejecting his friends from his house, including Donkey, who denounces him as \"Ebenezer Shrek\" in the heat of the argument. With their Christmas spirit ruined, Fiona is upset at Shrek's behavior and leaves with the ogre triplets. She catches up to their friends and explains to Donkey what Shrek had wanted for Christmas.\n\nShrek, remorseful at what he has done, catches up with the group and apologizes for lashing out at them earlier. He then tells everyone this is also his first Christmas, since ogres do not celebrate anything. They return to the swamp and Shrek tells his own version of \"The Night Before Christmas\", featuring himself as \"Ogre Claus\". Soon, they hear bells and go outside to see Santa and his reindeer, although Gingy is still afraid of Santa and runs back inside in fear. The special ends with Santa using his magic to put ogre ears on the moon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingy]]\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]] and [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|The Three Little Pigs]]\n* [[Aron Warner]] as [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]]\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Three Blind Mice]]\n* Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi, and Dante James Hauser as [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia|Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia]]\n* [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] as Bookstore Clerk\n* [[Gary Trousdale]] as Santa Claus\n\nADR loop group provided by [[Jack Blessing]], [[William Calvert (actor)|William Calvert]], [[Jennifer Crystal]], [[Leigh French]], [[Christie Mellor]] and [[Philip Proctor|Phil Proctor]].\n\n==Production==\n''Shrek the Halls'' was produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[Pacific Data Images|PDI/DreamWorks]].
