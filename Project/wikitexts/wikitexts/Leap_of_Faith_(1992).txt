The film is about Jonas Nightengale, a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[faith healing|faith healer]] who uses his [[revival meeting]]s to milk money out of the inhabitants  of Rustwater, [[Kansas]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Faith healing|Faith healer]] Jonas Nightengale and his manager Jane Larson break down in Rustwater, [[Kansas]]. Learning they will be stuck there for four days waiting for replacement parts to come in for their truck, Jonas decides to hold revival meetings to help pay for the repairs on the truck.\n\nLocal sheriff Will Braverman is skeptical and decides to investigate Jonas' past. He learns that Jonas is in fact Jack Newton, a native of [[New York City]] who lived a life of crime in his teen years. Braverman shares this information with the townspeople, who have gathered for another tent revival. Jonas storms off the stage, soon returning to successfully spin Braverman's report, leaving the crowd more energized than ever, much to Braverman's exasperation. Nightengale continues his dubious ministry over the next several days as Jane and Braverman find themselves falling for each other.\n\nNightengale attempts to begin a relationship with local diner waitress Marva, whose brother Boyd walks with [[crutch]]es following an auto accident. She explains that doctors could not find anything physically wrong with Boyd and his ailment is [[Somatic symptom disorder|psychosomatic]]. Boyd comes to believe that Jonas can make him walk again. During a meeting, Boyd walks to the crucifix and touches the feet of Jesus. He drops his crutches and begins to walk unassisted. The awed crowd sweeps the stage. After the show, an enraged Jonas rails to Jane that he was conned and that Boyd upstaged him.\n\nAfter the revival, Jonas enters the empty, darkened tent and mocks the crucifix and Christianity. Boyd walks in while Jonas is talking and says he wants to join Jonas on the road. Jonas agrees to meet Boyd the following morning, implying Boyd can come. Marva arrives and sends Boyd out of the tent. She thanks Jonas, who tells her that he will not be meeting her brother Boyd the next morning.\n\nJonas leaves the tent and sees the crowd that has gathered just outside it \u2014 many praying, some sleeping in groups, and others feeding the crowd that has gathered. He begins to understand that Boyd's miracle, and the faith that enabled it, are real after all. He packs a bag and departs alone under the cover of darkness, leaving behind his entire road show and hitching a ride with a truck driver bound for [[Pensacola, Florida]]. When asked by the driver if he is in some kind of trouble, Jonas replies, \"No sir, no sir. Probably for the first time in my life\". As they continue to ride along, the drought, threatening the crop harvest that is the centerpiece of the town's economy, comes to a dramatic end with a miraculous downpour. Jonas laughs silently to himself as he realizes the truth, and the film ends as he rides off into the stormy evening, hanging out the truck window loudly thanking Jesus for the rain.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Jonas Nightengale/Jack Newton\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Jane Larson\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Marva\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Sheriff Will Braverman\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Boyd\n* [[Albertina Walker]] as Lucille\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Hoover\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Matt\n* [[M.
