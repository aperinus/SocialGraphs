It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in [[Los Angeles]], who meets and befriends an [[amnesia]]c woman (Harring) recovering from a car accident. The story follows several other [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] and characters, including a Hollywood film director (Theroux).\n\nThe American-French co-production was originally conceived as a [[television pilot]], and a large portion of the film was shot in 1999 with Lynch's plan to keep it open-ended for a potential series. After viewing Lynch's cut, however, television executives rejected it. Lynch then provided an ending to the project, making it a [[feature film]]. The half-pilot, half-feature result, along with Lynch's characteristic surrealist style, has left the general meaning of the film's events open to interpretation. Lynch has declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative, leaving audiences, critics, and cast members to speculate on what transpires. He gave the film the tagline \"A love story in the city of dreams\".\n\nCategorized as a [[psychological thriller]], ''Mulholland Drive'' earned Lynch the ''[[Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' (Best Director Award) at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], sharing the prize with [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]''. Lynch also earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film boosted Watts' Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress [[Ann Miller]].\n\n''Mulholland Drive'' is often regarded as one of Lynch's finest works, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike. It was ranked 28th in the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 ''Sight & Sound'' critics' poll]] of the best films ever made, and topped a [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|2016 BBC poll]] of the best films since 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nA dark-haired woman is the sole survivor of a car crash on [[Mulholland Drive]], a winding road high in the [[Hollywood Hills]]. Injured and in shock, she makes her way down into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment. Later that morning, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, which is normally occupied by her Aunt Ruth. Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and calls herself \"Rita\" after seeing a poster for the film ''[[Gilda]]'' starring [[Rita Hayworth]]. To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key.\n\nAt a diner called Winkie's, a man tells another about a nightmare in which he dreamt of encountering a horrific figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man who had the nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead. Adam refuses and returns home to find his wife Lorraine cheating on him. When the mobsters withdraw his line of credit, Adam arranges to meet a mysterious cowboy, who cryptically urges him to cast Camilla for his own good. Meanwhile, a bungling hitman attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.\n\nWhile trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkie's and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \"Diane Selwyn\". They find Diane Selwyn in the phone book and call her, but she does not answer. Betty goes to an audition, where her performance is highly praised. A casting agent takes her to a soundstage where a film called ''The Sylvia North Story'', directed by Adam, is being cast. When Camilla Rhodes auditions with the song ''[[I've Told Ev'ry Little Star|I've Told Every Little Star]]'', Adam capitulates to casting her. Betty locks eyes with Adam, but she flees before she can meet him, saying she is late to meet a friend. Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's apartment, where a neighbor answers the door and tells them she has switched apartments with Diane. They go to the neighbor's apartment and break in when no one answers the door. In the bedroom, they find the body of a woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to Betty's apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. She and Betty have [[lesbian sex|sex]] that night.\n\nAt 2 a.m., Rita awakes suddenly, insisting they go right away to a theater called Club Silencio. There, the emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; [[Rebekah Del Rio]] comes on stage and begins singing the [[Roy Orbison]] song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" in Spanish, then collapses, unconscious, while her vocals continue in [[Playback singer|playback]]. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor. A stranger woman enters the room to find nobody.\n\nDiane Selwyn wakes up in her bed in the same apartment Betty and Rita investigated, where her neighbor informs her that two police officers have been looking for her. She looks exactly like Betty, but is a struggling actress driven into a deep depression by her failed affair with Camilla Rhodes, who is a successful actress and looks exactly like Rita. At Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. At dinner, Diane states she came to Hollywood from Canada when her Aunt Ruth died and left her some money, and she met Camilla at an audition for ''The Sylvia North Story''. Another woman who looks like the previous \"Camilla Rhodes\" kisses Camilla, and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make their marriage announcement, but they devolve into laughter and kiss while Diane watches, crying. Later, Diane meets the hitman at Winkie's, to hire him to kill Camilla. He tells her she will find a blue key when the job is completed. The figure from the man's dream is revealed to have the matching blue box. In her apartment, Diane looks at the blue key on her coffee table, when someone unceasingly knocks the door. Distraught, she is terrorized by hallucinations and runs screaming to her bed, where she shoots herself. A woman at the theater whispers, \"Silencio\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn\n* [[Laura Harring]] as Rita/Camilla Rhodes (credited as '''Laura Elena Harring''')\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Adam Kesher\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Coco\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Joe\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Detective McKnight\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Detective Domgaard\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Vincenzo Castigliane\n* [[Angelo Badalamenti]] as Luigi Castigliane\n* [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] as The Cowboy\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Louise Bonner\n* [[James Karen]] as Wally Brown\n* [[Chad Everett]] as Jimmy Katz\n* [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]] as The Magician\n* [[Rebekah Del Rio]] as Herself\n* [[Melissa George]] as Camilla Rhodes\n* [[Geno Silva]] as Cookie/Emcee\n* [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] as Gene\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Lorainne Kesher}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOriginally conceived as a television series, ''Mulholland Drive'' began as a 90-minute pilot produced for [[Touchstone Television]] and intended for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network. Tony Krantz, the agent who was responsible for the development of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', was \"fired up\" about doing another television series. Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, \"I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble\u2014she ''is'' trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.{{' \"}} Lynch showed ABC a rough cut of the pilot. The person who saw it, according to Lynch, was watching it at six in the morning and was having coffee and standing up. He hated the pilot, and ABC immediately cancelled it. Pierre Edleman, Lynch's friend from Paris, came to visit and started talking to him about the film being a feature. Edleman went back to Paris. Canal+ wanted to give Lynch money to make it into a feature and it took a year to negotiate.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=206}}<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGd6lnYTTY8&t=1905s | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/jGd6lnYTTY8| archive-date=2021-11-14 | url-status=live|title=David Lynch In Conversation |minutes=34:22\u201336:07 |work=Queensland Art Gallery & Gallery of Modern Art|date=June 15, 2015|via=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nLynch described the attractiveness of the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: \"I'm a sucker for a continuing story&nbsp;...

Lynch remembered, \"All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it because we had a deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything.

''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' film critic [[David Sterritt]] spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director \"insisted that ''Mulholland Drive'' does tell a coherent, comprehensible story\", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=David |last=Sterritt |title=Lynch's twisty map to 'Mulholland Drive' |date=October 12, 2001 |magazine=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |page=15 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1012/p15s1-almo.html |access-date=August 10, 2001 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011012102733/http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1012/p15s1-almo.html |archive-date=October 12, 2001}}</ref> On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, \"I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want.

David works from his subconscious.\"<ref name=\"timestheroux\" />\n\n===Dreams and alternative realities===\nAn early interpretation of the film uses [[dream analysis]] to argue that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful \"Betty Elms\", reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last one-fifth of the film presents Diane's real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.<ref name=\"tang\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |last=Tang |first=Jean |title=All you have to do is dream |date=November 7, 2001 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229232151/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/11/07/mulholland_dream/ |archive-date=December 29, 2008 |access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, \"I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the [[damsel in distress]] and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be.\"<ref name=\"fuller\"/> Watts's own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, \"There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely.\"<ref name=\"pearce\">{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Gareth |date=January 6, 2002 |title=Why Naomi is a girl's best friend |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |page=14}}</ref> Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' found that \"everything in 'Mulholland Drive' is a nightmare.

Rita and Betty then gaze at each other in the mirror \"drawing attention to their physical similarity, linking the sequence to theme of embrace, physical coupling and the idea of merging or doubling\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Mirroring and doubles, which are prominent themes throughout the film, serve to further queer the form and content of the film.\n\nSeveral theorists have accused Lynch of perpetuating stereotypes and clich\u00e9s of lesbians, bisexuals and lesbian relationships. Rita (the femme fatale) and Betty (the school girl) represent two classic stock lesbian characters; Heather Love identifies two key clich\u00e9s used in the film: \"Lynch presents lesbianism in its innocent and expansive form: lesbian desire appears as one big adventure, an entr\u00e9e into a glamorous and unknown territory\".<ref name=\"love\">{{cite journal | last1 = Love | first1 = Heather | year = 2004| title = Spectacular failure: the figure of the lesbian in ''Mulholland Drive'' | journal = New Literary History | volume =  35| pages =  117\u2013132| doi = 10.1353/nlh.2004.0021 | s2cid = 144210949 }}</ref> Simultaneously, he presents the tragic lesbian triangle, \"in which an attractive but unavailable woman dumps a less attractive woman who is figured as exclusively lesbian\", perpetuating the stereotype of the bisexual \"ending up with a man\".<ref name=\"love\" /> Maria San Filippo recognizes that Lynch relies on classic film noir archetypes to develop Camilla's eventual betrayal: these archetypes \"become ingrained to such a degree that viewers are immediately cued that \"Rita\" is not what she seems and that it is only a matter of time before she reveals her duplicitous nature.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filippo|first=Maria San|date=2007|title=The 'Other' Dreamgirl: Female Bisexuality As the 'Dark Secret' of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001)|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=7|issue=1\u20132|pages=13\u201349|language=en|doi=10.1300/J159v07n01_03|s2cid=145648137}}</ref> For Love, Diane's exclusively lesbian desire is \"between success and failure, between sexiness and abjection, even between life and death\" if she is rejected.<ref name=\"love\" /> Diane is the tragic lesbian clich\u00e9 pining after the bisexual in the heterosexual relationship. Love's analysis of the film notes the media's peculiar response to the film's lesbian content: \"reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the film's sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most.\"<ref name=\"love\" /> She points out that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are \"understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic\" as \"the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman\".<ref name=\"love\" />\n\nHeterosexuality as primary is important in the latter half of the film, as the ultimate demise of Diane and Camilla's relationship springs from the matrimony of the heterosexual couple. At Adam's party, they begin to announce that Camilla and Adam are getting married; through laughs and kisses, the declaration is delayed because it is obvious and expected. The heterosexual closure of the scene is  interrupted by a scene change. As Lee Wallace suggests, by planning a hit against Camilla, \"Diane circumvents the heterosexual closure of the industry story but only by going over to its storyworld, an act that proves fatal for both women, the cause and effect relations of the thriller being fundamentally incompatible with the plot of lesbianism as the film presents it\".<ref name=\":0\" />  For Joshua Bastian Cole,  Adam's character serves as Diane's foil, what she can never be, which is why Camilla leaves her. In her fantasy, Adam has his own subplot which leads to his humiliation. While this subplot can be understood as a revenge fantasy born from jealousy, Cole argues that this is an example of Diane's transgender gaze: \"Adam functions like a mirror \u2013 a male object upon which Diane might project herself\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Joshua Bastian|date=March 2018|title=Passing Glances: Recognizing the Trans Gaze in Mulholland Drive|journal=Somatechnics|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.3366/soma.2018.0238|issn=2044-0138}}</ref> Diane's prolonged eye-contact with Dan at Winkie's is another example of the trans gaze. For Cole, \"Diane's strange recognition of Dan, which is not quite identification but something else, feels trans in its oblique line, drawn between impossible doubles\" and their similar names (Dan/Diane) which is no mistake.<ref name=\":2\" /> He stresses that the lesbian understanding of the film has overshadowed potential trans interpretations; his reading of Diane's trans gaze is a contribution to the queer narrative of the film''.''\n\nMedia portrayals of Naomi Watts's and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, \"I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit.\"<ref>[[Dennis Hensley]], \"Lust Highway\", ''[[Total Film]]'' 61 (February 2002): 72\u201374.</ref> However, in another interview Watts stated, \"I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic.\"<ref name=\"pearce\" /> While Harring was quoted saying, \"The love scene just happened in my eyes.

Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is \"the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her\".<ref name=\"lopate\" /> A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave.<ref name=\"hudson\" /> Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch's films, states that the first portion of ''Mulholland Drive'' can be construed as Rita's fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita's anxiety about her loss of identity.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=199}} According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=94}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| total_width = 350\n| caption_align = center\n| image1    = Rita Poster Mulholland.jpg\n| alt1= Laura Elena Harring wet from a shower and wrapped in a red towel, looking into the mirror at a reflection of the theatrical poster for the film ''Gilda''\n| caption1 = {{resize|Harring as the dark-haired woman}}\n| image2    = Gilda (1946 one-sheet poster - Style B).jpg\n| alt2      = Poster for the film ''Gilda'' with Rita Hayworth\n| caption2 = {{resize|''[[Gilda]]'' poster (1946)}}\n| footer = The dark-haired woman assumes the name \"Rita\" after seeing the name on a poster.

David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that \"occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters\".<ref name=\"Roche\" /> Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig\u2014ostensibly to disguise herself\u2014but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.<ref name=\"nochimson\" />\n\n'''Diane Selwyn''' (Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood.<ref name=\"holden\" /> For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film \"makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Diane's fantasies\", but because Rita is only a \"blank cover girl\" Diane has \"invested herself in emptiness\", which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide.{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=95}} Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates \"through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall\u2014not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge\".<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of [[narcissism]], as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be.<ref name=\"ridgway\">{{cite journal |last=Ridgway |first=Franklin |date=Fall 2006 |title=You Came Back!; Or Mulholland Treib |journal=Post Script: Essays in Film and the Humanities |issue=26 |volume=1 |pages=43\u201361}}</ref> Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is \"a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry\".{{sfn|Johnson|2004|p=137}} Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Rita's fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate that something is dark and wrong in Betty and Rita's world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her.{{sfn|Johnson|2004|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\n'''Camilla Rhodes''' (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam.

Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have \"sucked the life out of Diane\".<ref name=\"love\" /> Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane\u2014at Camilla's request\u2014where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.<ref name=\"wyman\">{{cite web |last3=Wyman |first3=Bill |last1=Garrone |first1=Max |last2=Klein |first2=Andy |title=Everything you were afraid to ask about 'Mulholland Drive' |work=Salon |date=October 23, 2001 |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html |access-date=August 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522071207/http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/feature/2001/10/23/mulholland_drive_analysis/index.html |archive-date=May 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n'''Adam Kesher''' (Justin Theroux) is established in the first portion of the film as a \"vaguely arrogant\",{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=208}} but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another.

He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from the first part of the film to the second.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|pp=205\u2013206}} One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power.<ref name=\"nochimson\" /> Another analysis suggests that \"Adam Kesher does not have the control, he wants and is willing to step over who or what is necessary to consolidate his career.

These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars,<ref name=\"ridgway\" />{{sfn|Sheen|Davison|2004|p=171}} and they portray a \"vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives\".<ref name=\"taubin\" /> Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, in the first part of the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam's mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane's embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.<ref name=\"ridgway\" />\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Mulholland Drive Mr Roque.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A short, strange-looking man seated in a large wooden wheelchair under an intense beam of light in a large and sparsely furnished room; a desk is in a far corner and the walls are covered in curtains.|Dwarf actor [[Michael J. Anderson]], as Mr. Roque, was fitted with oversized prosthetic limbs to give him the appearance of an abnormally small head.]]\n\nThe filmmaking style of David Lynch has been written about extensively using descriptions like \"ultraweird\",<ref name=\"zacharek\" /> \"dark\"<ref name=\"nochimson\" /> and \"oddball\".{{sfn|Johnson|2004|p=6}} Todd McGowan writes, \"One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films.\"{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=2}} Through Lynch's juxtaposition of clich\u00e9 and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing.<ref name=\"vass\"/> Many of the characters in ''Mulholland Drive'' are archetypes that can only be perceived as clich\u00e9: the new Hollywood hopeful, the femme fatale, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully.<ref name=\"love\" /> Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst, Jennifer Hudson, writes of him, \"Like most surrealists, Lynch's language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams.\"<ref name=\"hudson\" />\n\nDavid Lynch uses various methods of deception in ''Mulholland Drive''. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, who seems to control film studios, is portrayed by [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Michael J. Anderson]] (also from ''[[Twin Peaks]]''). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=209}} During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate \"cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]\" act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses.<ref name=\"ridgway\" /> In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: \"It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not.\"<ref name=\"ridgway\"/>\n\nAccording to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of different camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer \"identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space\", but that Lynch at moments also \"disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective\" so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling \"our sense of the individual and the human\".{{sfn|Dillon|2006|p=100}} Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film \"renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence\", such as the scene in Winkie's where the \"camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue\" by which the \"spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several [[avant-garde]] techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, [[computer-generated imagery]], nondiegetic images, [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear narration]] and [[intertextuality]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hersey |first=Curt |year=2002 |title=Diegetic Breaks and the Avant-Garde |journal=The Journal of Moving Image Studies |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FightMulholland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring arguing on two sides of an open door|An emotionally troubled Diane exchanges words with Camilla.

Diane's scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment,<ref name=\"nochimson\" /> which contrasts with the first portion of the film where \"even the plainest decor seems to sparkle\", Betty and Rita glow with light and transitions between scenes are smooth.<ref name=\"mcgowan\">{{cite journal |last=McGowan |first=Todd |year=2004 |title=Lost on Mulholland Drive: Navigating David Lynch's Panegyric to Hollywood |journal=Cinema Journal |issue=43 |volume=2 |pages=67\u201389 |doi=10.1353/cj.2004.0008}}</ref> Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla's party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane's hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie's after Diane's suicide, or the \"repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured\" in the early portion of the film, creates the [[Uncanny|uncanny effect]] where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations.<ref name=\"sinnerbrink\" /> Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie's as \"extremely uncanny\", because it is a scene where the \"boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of \"uncanny metaphors\"; the [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object\u2014primarily the blue box\u2014that initiates Rita's disappearance and Diane's real life.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kokko |first=Valtteri |year=2004 |url=http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |title=Psychological Horror in the Films of David Lynch |journal=Wider Screen |issue=1 |access-date=August 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927081849/http://www.widerscreen.fi/2004/1/psychological_horror_in_the_films_of_lynch.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAnother recurring element in Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, \"you look at the image and the scene silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical.\"<ref name=\"divine\"/> In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added \"a hint of the steam [from the wreck] and the screaming kids\", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified.{{sfn|Woods|2000|p=208}} Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects.<ref name=\"horan\">{{cite web |last=Horan |first=Anthony |title=Mulholland Drive |url=http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=1526 |work=DVD.net.au|date=n.d. |access-date=August 10, 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804083633/http://www.dvd.net.au/review.cgi?review_id=1526 |archive-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> Hageman also identifies \"perpetual and uncanny ambient sound\", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise \"creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order\".<ref name=\"hageman\" /> ''Mulholland Drive''{{'}}s ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, \"The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma.\"<ref name=\"perlmutter\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=The album progresses much like a typical Lynch film, opening with a quick, pleasant Jitterbug and then slowly delving into darker string passages, the twangy guitar sounds of '50s diner music and, finally, the layered, disturbing, often confusing underbelly of the score.|source=Neil Shurley, 2002<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shurley |first=Neil |date=6 January 2002 |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3690 |title=CD reviews: Mulholland Drive |journal=Film Score Daily |access-date=19 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301215424/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3690 |archive-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nThe soundtrack of ''Mulholland Drive'' was supervised by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who collaborated on previous Lynch projects ''Blue Velvet'' and ''Twin Peaks''.<ref name=\"jolin\">{{cite journal |last=Jolin |first=Dan |date=February 2002 |title=Angelo Badalamenti |journal=Total Film |issue=61 |page=113}}</ref> Badalamenti, who was nominated for awards from the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) for his work on the film,<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards01/mpawards.aspx |title=AFI AWARDS 2001: Movies of the Year |publisher=[[American Film Institute|afi.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605093838/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/afiawards01/mpawards.aspx |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"bafta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/search.html?q=angelo%20badalamenti&w=true |title=The 2001 Anthony Asquith Award for the achievement in Film Music -
