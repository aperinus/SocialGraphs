Jackson]], [[Vanessa Williams|Vanessa L. Williams]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Dan Hedaya]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Toni Collette]] and [[Richard Roundtree]].\n\nAlthough the film shares the same title as the [[Shaft (1971 film)|1971 film]], it is a contemporary [[sequel]] with Jackson's John Shaft character being related to the earlier films' Shaft. The film received generally positive reviews and opened at the number-one position at the box office when it debuted June 16, 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nCalled in to investigate the grievous assault of Trey Howard outside a restaurant, [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Detective John Shaft arrests Walter Wade Jr., the son of a wealthy real estate tycoon, after noticing blood on him. Wade claims [[self-defense]]. Shaft notices an injured waitress, Diane Palmieri, eyeing Wade, and unsuccessfully tries to coax a statement from her. Trey's friend tells Shaft that when she and Trey entered the restaurant, Wade [[Racism|racially harassed]] him. Trey humiliated Wade back and left the restaurant, pursued by Wade. Shaft looks for Diane but she has left. Trey goes into a seizure and dies; when Wade mocks Trey, Shaft punches Wade on the nose, and does it again after being threatened with reassignment to another precinct. At the trial, the judge grants Wade [[bail]] of $200k. He later calls Shaft to thank him for breaking his nose, and says he has fled to Switzerland.\n\nTwo years later, Wade returns to the U.S., and Shaft greets and arrests him. Shaft's friends throw him a celebratory party where the elder \"Uncle\" Shaft appears and warns him that Wade's wealth raises his chances of acquittal. While Wade is temporarily detained at police headquarters, [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] drug lord Peoples Hernandez, whom Shaft previously arrested, befriends him. At the hearing, the judge has Wade surrender his passport and sets bail at $1 million. Shaft resigns from the police force, vowing to bring Wade to justice on his own terms.\n\nShaft searches for Diane but only locates her mother Ann, while Wade offers his deceased mother's jewelry to hire Peoples to go after her. Peoples wants Wade to join him in his drug business, but agrees to the job provided that Wade sells the jewelry. Peoples hires Shaft's former colleague officers Jack Roselli and Jimmy Groves to tail Shaft; the pair reveal a snitch among Peoples' gang who had told Shaft what was happening. Disguised, Shaft and his former partner, Detective Luger, mug Wade of the money he gathered from selling the jewelry. He then plants the money on Roselli and Groves, and makes Peoples think they are double-crossing him. However, after getting word that Shaft has left the scene, they follow him.\n\nHaving traced a phone call, Shaft eventually locates Diane, but Peoples' gang attacks them. In the shootout, Shaft kills Peoples' little brother. Diane's brothers Mikey and Frankie arrive to retrieve her, but Mikey is stabbed by Peoples. Shaft, Diane, Rasaan, and Frankie regroup at Rasaan's apartment, secretly followed by Roselli and Groves. Diane tells Shaft her eyewitness account of Wade murdering Trey. Wade threatens her to keep silent, and then she agrees to accept a payoff provided that she disappear. Meanwhile, Peoples angrily attacks Wade over his brother's death.\n\nRoselli and Groves stake out Rassan's apartment but when Carmen arrives and starts asking questions, they shoot her in the chest. Peoples' gang attack, but Shaft shoots back, while Diane and the others flee. Roselli and Groves catch Shaft, who commands Carmen, who was wearing a [[bulletproof vest|vest]], to kill them. Peoples and his gang pursue and take down Rassan's car. When Peoples holds Diane hostage, Shaft persuades him to fight without weapons, but after a momentary faceoff, they draw backup handguns, with Shaft killing Peoples first.\n\nShaft assures Trey's mother Carla about the new trial conditions, however, when Wade arrives, she shoots him several times and is subsequently arrested. Back at the police station, Shaft reiterates to Carmen his preference to be a private detective. A woman asks them for help filing assault charges against her [[Domestic violence|abusive]] boyfriend. Initially hesitatant, he decides to help her via his methods upon seeing her injury. He and his uncle go together to confront the boyfriend, along with Rasaan, whom Shaft presents with a new ride.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- opening title cards, see also https://books.google.com/books?id=TLCzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211 -->\n* [[Samuel L.
