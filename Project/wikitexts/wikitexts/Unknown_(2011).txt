At their hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it. The taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the [[Spree (river)|Spree]], knocking him unconscious. The driver rescues him but flees the scene. Harris regains consciousness at a hospital after being in a coma for four days.\n\nWhen Harris returns to the hotel, he discovers Liz with another man. Liz says this man is her husband and declares she does not know Harris. The police are called, and Harris attempts to prove his identity by calling a colleague named Rodney Cole, to no avail. He writes down his schedule for the next day from memory. When he visits the office of Professor Leo Bressler, whom he is scheduled to meet, \"Dr. Harris\" is already there. As Harris attempts to prove his identity, \"Harris\" provides identification and a family photo, both of which have his face. Overwhelmed by the [[identity crisis]], Harris loses consciousness and awakens back at the hospital. A terrorist named Smith kills Harris's attending nurse, but Harris is able to escape from him.\n\nHarris seeks help from a private investigator and former [[Stasi]] agent Ernst J\u00fcrgen. Harris's only clues are his father's book on botany and Gina, the taxi driver, an undocumented [[Bosnia]]n immigrant who has been working at a diner since the crash. While Harris persuades her to help him, J\u00fcrgen researches Harris and the biotechnology summit, discovering it is to be attended by Prince Shada of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The prince is funding a secret project headed by Bressler, and has survived numerous assassination attempts. J\u00fcrgen suspects that the identity theft might be related.\n\nHarris and Gina are attacked in her apartment by Smith and another terrorist, Jones; they escape after Gina kills Smith. Harris finds that Liz has written a series of numbers in his book, numbers that correspond to words found on specific pages. Using his schedule, Harris confronts Liz alone; she tells him that he left his briefcase at the airport. Meanwhile, J\u00fcrgen receives Cole at his office and reveals his findings of a secret terrorist group known as Section 15. J\u00fcrgen soon deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and member of the group. Knowing Cole is there to interrogate and kill him and with no way of escape, J\u00fcrgen commits suicide to protect Harris.\n\nAfter retrieving his briefcase, Harris parts ways with Gina. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxi and follows them. When Harris awakes, Cole explains that \"Martin Harris\" is just a cover name created by Harris. His head injury caused him to believe the cover persona was real; when Liz notified Cole of the injury, \"Harris\" was activated as his replacement. Gina runs over Jones before he can kill Harris, then rams Cole's van off a ledge, killing him as well. After Harris finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, he remembers that he and Liz were in Berlin three months earlier to plant a bomb in Prince Shada's suite.\n\nNow aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Harris seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. Hotel security immediately arrests Harris and Gina, but Harris proves his earlier visit to the hotel. After security is convinced of the bomb's presence, they evacuate the hotel.\n\nHarris realizes that Section 15's target is not Prince Shada, but Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. Liz accesses Bressler's laptop and steals the data. With Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Seeing that the assassination attempt has been foiled, Liz tries to disarm the bomb but fails and is killed when it explodes. Harris kills \"Harris\", the last remaining Section 15 terrorist, before he can murder Bressler. While Bressler announces that he is giving his project to the world for free, Harris and Gina\u2014with new identities\u2014board a train together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=2\n* 0em}}\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Martin Harris\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Gina\n* [[January Jones]] as Elizabeth \"Liz\" Harris\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as imposter Martin\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Rodney Cole\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Ernst J\u00fcrgen, a former [[Stasi]] operative\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as Professor Bressler\n* [[Stipe Erceg]] as Jones\n* Olivier Schneider as Smith\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as Herr Strauss (chief of hotel security)\n* [[Mido Hamada]] as Prince Shada\n* [[Karl Markovics]] as Dr. Farge\n* [[Eva L\u00f6bau]] as Nurse Gretchen Erfurt\n* Clint Dyer as Biko\n* {{div col end}}\nMany German actors were cast for the film.
