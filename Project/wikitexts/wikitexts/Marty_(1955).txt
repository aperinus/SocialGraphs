''Marty'', ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945) and ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' (2019) are the only three films to win both organizations' grand prizes.\n\nIn 1994, ''Marty'' was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|date=15 November 1994|access-date=17 May 2021|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMarty Piletti is an Italian-American butcher who lives in [[The Bronx]] with his mother. Unmarried at 34, the good-natured but socially awkward Marty faces constant badgering from family and friends to settle down, as they point out that all his brothers and sisters are already married, most of them with children. Not averse to marriage but disheartened by his lack of prospects, Marty has reluctantly resigned himself to bachelorhood.\n\nAfter being harassed by his mother into going to the Stardust Ballroom one Saturday night, Marty connects with Clara, a plain science teacher at [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New York City)|Benjamin Franklin High School]], who is quietly weeping on the roof after being callously abandoned at the ballroom by her blind date. They spend the evening together dancing, walking the busy streets, and talking in a diner. Marty eagerly spills out his life story and ambitions, and they encourage each other. He takes Clara to his house and they awkwardly express their mutual attraction, shortly before his mother returns. Marty takes her home by bus, promising to call her at 2:30 the next afternoon, after Mass. Overjoyed on his way back home, he punches the bus stop sign and weaves between the cars, looking for a cab instead.\n\nMeanwhile, Marty's Aunt Catherine moves in to live with Marty and his mother. She warns his mother that Marty will soon marry and cast her aside. Fearing that Marty's romance could spell her abandonment, his mother belittles Clara. Marty's friends, with an undercurrent of envy, deride Clara for her plainness and try to convince him to forget her and to remain with them, unmarried, in their fading youth. Harangued into submission by the pull of his friends, Marty doesn't call Clara.\n\nThat night, back in the same lonely rut, Marty realizes that he is giving up a woman whom he not only likes, but who makes him happy. Over the objections of his friends, he dashes to a phone booth to call Clara, who is disconsolately watching television with her parents. When his friend asks what he's doing, Marty bursts out saying:\n\n{{blockquote|You don't like her, my mother don't like her, she's a dog and I'm a fat, ugly man! Well, all I know is I had a good time last night! I'm gonna have a good time tonight! If we have enough good times together, I'm gonna get down on my knees and I'm gonna ''beg'' that girl to marry me! If we make a party on New Year's, I got a date for that party. You don't like her? That's too bad!}}\n\nMarty closes the phone booth's door when Clara answers the phone. In the last line of the film, he tentatively says \"Hello...Hello, Clara?\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ernest Borgnine-Betsy Blair in Marty trailer.jpg|thumb|Ernest Borgnine with Betsy Blair in the trailer for ''Marty'', 1955]]\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Marty Piletti\n* [[Betsy Blair]] as Clara Snyder\n* Esther Minciotti as Mrs. Teresa Piletti, Marty's mother\n* Augusta Ciolli as Aunt Catherine, Ms. Piletti's sister \n* [[Joe Mantell]] as Angie, Marty's best friend \n* [[Karen Steele]] as Virginia, Aunt Catherine's daughter-in-law\n* [[Jerry Paris]] as Tommy, Aunt Catherine's son\n* [[Frank Sutton]] as Ralph (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nFor the film, Esther Minciotti, Augusta Ciolli and Joe Mantell reprised their roles from the live television production. The screenplay changed the name of the Waverly Ballroom to the Stardust Ballroom. The film expanded the role of Clara, and added subplots about Marty's career, his mother, and her sister.<ref name=two>Chayefsky, Paddy. \"Two Choices of Material\". ''Television Plays'', Simon & Schuster, 1955.</ref>\n\n[[Rod Steiger]], who had played Marty in the teleplay, initially declined an offer to reprise the role after [[Harold Hecht]] and [[Burt Lancaster]], the film's producers, demanded Steiger sign a multiple-picture commitment as a condition of retaining his role.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1956/01/29/archives/rod-steiger-from-va-to-vip-on-screen-japanese-triangle.html Schmidt, M.A. \"Rod Steiger: From V.A. to V.I.P. on Screen\", ''The New York Times'', January 29, 1956.]</ref> Ernest Borgnine assumed the title role in Steiger's stead.\n\nShooting for the film began on September 7, 1954 in The Bronx and included many aspects of the borough into the film, such as [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Arthur Avenue]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[White Plains Road]], and several Bronx subway and elevated train lines, including the [[IND Concourse Line|Concourse]], [[IRT Third Avenue Line|Third Avenue]], [[IRT White Plains Road Line|White Plains Road]], and [[IRT Jerome Avenue Line|Jerome Avenue]] lines. On-set filming took place at Samuel Goldwyn Studios on November 1, 1954. Bronx native [[Jerry Orbach]] made his film debut in an uncredited role as a ballroom patron. Chayefsky had an uncredited cameo as Leo.\n\nThe role of Clara initially was going to be reprised by actress [[Nancy Marchand]], later of ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' fame, who had portrayed the character in the television version. However, actress Betsy Blair was interested in playing the role and lobbied for it. At the time, Blair, who was married to actor [[Gene Kelly]], had been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed due to her [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] sympathies. It was only through the lobbying of Kelly, who used his major star status and connections at MGM to pressure [[United Artists]], that Blair got the role. Reportedly, Kelly threatened to withdraw from the film ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]'' if Blair did not get the role of Clara.<ref>Multiple sources:\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/movies/19blair.html?_r=0 Betsy Blair, 85, Actress and Wife of Gene Kelly, Is Dead], ''The New York Times'', March 19, 2009\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/16/betsy-blair-obituary Betsy Blair], ''The Guardian'', March 16, 2009\n*Hirschhorn, Clive (1984).
