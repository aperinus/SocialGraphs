It is set in the context of the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]. Colonel Braddock, who escaped a [[Vietnam]]ese [[prisoner of war]] camp 10 years earlier, returns to Vietnam to find [[United States|American]] soldiers listed as missing in action during the [[Vietnam War]]. The film was followed by a [[prequel]], ''[[Missing in Action 2: The Beginning]]'' (1985), and a [[sequel]], ''[[Braddock: Missing in Action III]]'' (1988). It is the first installment in the ''Missing in Action'' film series. \"Missing In Action\" was actually intended to be a sequel to \"Missing in Action 2\", but when it became clear that \"Missing in Action\" was a much better film with stronger commercial prospects, \"Missing in Action 2\" was turned into both a sequel and a prequel that detailed events before those in \"Missing in Action.\"\n\nIt is the first of a series of films themed around the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]] that were produced by [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] and released under their [[Cannon Films]] banner, with whom Norris would have a long professional relationship. Norris later dedicated these films to his younger brother Wieland. Wieland, a private in the [[101st Airborne Division]], had been killed in June 1970 in Vietnam while on patrol in the defense of [[Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord|Firebase Ripcord]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thewall-usa.com/info.asp?recid=38095|title=PFC Wieland Clyde Norris|work=The Virtual Wall}}</ref> The film, however, was criticized heavily as being a preemptive cash-in on the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theflickcast.com/2011/05/16/war-movie-mondays-missing-in-action/|title=War Movie Mondays, ''Missing in Action'' Movie Review|date=16 May 2011|publisher=The Flick Cast|access-date=July 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdose.com/box-office-flashback-december-10-1984/|title=Box Office Flashback, December 10, 1984|date=10 December 2010|publisher=Pop Dose: Pop Culture News, Reviews and Discussion|access-date=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly negative reception from critics, the film was a commercial success and has become one of Chuck Norris's most popular films. It was also Chuck Norris's first film with The Cannon Group.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{more plot|date=March 2022}}\nColonel James Braddock is a US military officer who spent seven years in a North Vietnamese [[POW]] camp, which he escaped 10 years ago. After the war, Braddock accompanies a government investigation team that travels to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] to investigate reports of US soldiers still held prisoner. Braddock obtains the evidence then travels to [[Thailand]], where he meets Jack \"Tuck\" Tucker, an old Army friend turned [[black market]] kingpin. Together, they launch a mission deep into the jungle to free the US POW's from General Tran.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Colonel James Braddock\n* [[M.

The producers' idea was to create a [[Vietnam War]] hero with the name of a lazy Californian student.\n\nThe concept for the film originated from a [[film treatment|treatment]], written by [[James Cameron]] in 1983, for the film ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' that was floating around [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theflickcast.com/2011/05/16/war-movie-mondays-missing-in-action/|title=War Movie Mondays, ''Missing in Action'' Movie Review|date=16 May 2011|publisher=The Flick Cast|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesoothsayer.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/movie-review-missing-in-action-trilogy/|title=Movie Review: Missing in Action Trilogy|date=28 September 2011|publisher=[[WordPress]]|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> This explains the similar [[Dramatic structure|plotlines]] between [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]] and the ''Missing in Action'' film series. Representatives from [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Group]] said Cameron's script served as inspiration to the film and subsequently produced and released the first two ''Missing in Action'' films two months before the release of ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=missinginaction2.htm|title=Box Office Information for ''Missing in Action 2''|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rambo2.htm|title=Box Office Information for ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> in order to avoid copyright violation lawsuits.\n\nNorris says he was approached to make the film by Lance Hool, who had a script about American POWs in Vietnam. Norris was enthusiastic as he wanted to pay tribute to his brother Wieland. Vietnam films were not popular at the time however and Norris and Hool received numerous rejections.<ref name=\"Norris p 121\">Norris p 121</ref>\n\nNorris said he tried \"to instill a positive attitude\" about the Vietnam War by making the film.<ref>CHUCK NORRIS--AN ALL-AMERICAN HIT\nBROESKE, PAT H. Los Angeles Times (19 May 1985: ac20.</ref>  He did say \"Vietnam was a tragic mistake. If you don't want to win the battle, don't get involved.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nHe added, \"I am a conservative, a real flag waver, a big Ronald Reagan fan. I'm not so much a Republican or Democrat; I go more for the man himself. Ronald Reagan says what he thinks, he's not afraid to speak his mind, even if he may be unpopular. I want a strong leader and he is a strong leader. And ever since he has been in office there has been a more positive, patriotic feeling in this country.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nHool and Norris took the project to Cannon Films, who liked the project. They already had a script in development about the rescue of American POWS in Vietnam, and signed Norris to make both films. The first, ''Missing in Action'', would be about Braddock's rescue of POWS. The second, ''Missing in Action 2'', would be a prequel about Braddock's years as a POW. The two films were shot back-to-back. Joseph Zito directed the first, Hool the second.<ref name=\"Norris p 121\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming was to have started in [[Saint Kitts]] in January 1984.<ref>Sneed & Lavin INC.: Good night, Walter!

There is not an American pilot alive who would leave them there. They'd have to shoot me to stop me from picking them up, because I'd be dead inside if I didn't.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was popular at the box office, one of the most successful ever made by Cannon.

He does talk, of course, but his real eloquence is exclusively physical. There's not quite enough of it to explain why someone of Mr. Norris's taciturn manner and unprepossessing blond looks has managed to become an international B-movie star.
