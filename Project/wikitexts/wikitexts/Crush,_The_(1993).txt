When 28-year-old writer Nick Elliot moves to a new city for a magazine job, Adrian Forrester, the 14-year-old daughter of the landlords whose guesthouse he rents, instantly makes her attraction to Nick clear. However, while Nick romances photographer Amy Maddik at work, he has trouble fending off Adrian's advances. As her obsession with Nick grows, Adrian becomes angry at being rejected and starts attacking his property and friends. It was filmed on location from September 24 to November 20, 1992,<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106627/business The Crush Box Office]</ref> in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. The movie quickly became a cult classic. It also influenced other thriller and suspense movies of 90s and 2000s.\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty-eight-year-old writer Nick Eliot secures a job at ''Pique'' magazine and lodging in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester. The handsome Nick soon becomes acquainted with and frequently visited by the couple's 14-year-old daughter, Adrian, a precocious girl who becomes intensely infatuated with him.\n\nAdrian invites Nick to a party that her parents are throwing at their house. Without confirming that he will attend, Nick decides to stop in. As he enters the house, Nick is taken by Adrian's impressive piano performance. Nick follows Adrian to her parents' outdoor balcony afterwards. He muses that if she were just 10 years older, as she flirtatiously interrupts him, questioning what he'd do. Redirecting the conversation, Adrian suddenly encourages Nick to take her for a ride in his convertible. Nick agrees to drive Adrian to a place of her choosing; a romantic secluded area where she attempts to kiss him. Though initially receptive to the kiss, Nick stops when he realizes he is being seduced. Without leading her on, Nick takes Adrian home. \n \nAdrian's crush on Nick intensifies, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off. He begins a budding romance with coworker Amy. Adrian continues to boldly pursue him, sneaking into his room to rewrite his article (which impresses his boss) and even going so far as to undress in front of him when he accidentally hides in her closet. When Nick continues to rebuff her advances, Adrian's actions become destructive; she steals his favorite childhood photo, defaces a car he has restored, and erases his computer discs, yet he's unable to convince her parents of her guilt. Cheyenne, a friend of Adrian's, tries to warn Nick about her, but she has an \"accident\" at the riding school she and Adrian attend together when Adrian sabotages the saddle on her horse. After Adrian spies on Nick in bed with Amy, she locks Amy in her darkroom and empties a wasps' nest into the vents, exploiting Amy's [[spheksophobia]]. Amy survives, and Nick, now convinced that Adrian is big trouble, attempts to find new lodging. However, Adrian accuses him of sexually assaulting her with \"evidence\" obtained from a used condom from Nick's trash; he is subsequently arrested. After Michael bails him out (and suspends him until trial), Cheyenne tells Nick that she knows he is innocent and that Adrian has an extensive history of obsessive behavior, citing a previous crush on a camp counselor named Rick who \"accidentally\" died from eating something poisonous. Cheyenne also informs Nick of a diary Adrian kept that can exonerate him.\n\nAfter Cheyenne departs, Nick hears strange noises coming from the Forresters' house. He investigates and finds Cheyenne bound and gagged on the carousel in the attic. Adrian confronts and attacks him, leading Cliff to attack Nick after he mistakes him for the aggressor. Adrian then knocks Cliff unconscious in defense of Nick, enabling the latter to subdue her with one punch. Acquitted, Nick goes to live with Amy in [[Seattle]] while Adrian is confined to a psychiatric hospital in [[Spanaway]]. Though she laments that Nick refuses to speak to her, respond to the multiple letters she has written, or accept her apologies, her doctor comments that she is making good progress, unaware that she is now developing a crush on him. In the final scene, Adrian returns to her room in the hospital, where she glares at a photo of the doctor and his wife before her mouth slowly curves into a devious smile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Eliot\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Adrian/Darian Forrester\n* [[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as Amy Maddik\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Cliff Forrester\n* [[Gwynyth Walsh]] as Liv Forrester\n* [[Amber Benson]] as Cheyenne\n* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Michael\n\n==Lawsuit and character name change==\nWriter and director Alan Shapiro based the film on events from his own life. The girl on whom he based Adrian sued him for using her real name, Darian, for Alicia Silverstone's character. As a result, when the film was re-edited for TV, the character's name was changed from Darian to Adrian. Silverstone is still credited as having played Darian Forrester on [[IMDb]].<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106627/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |title=The Crush Trivia |work=imdb.com}}</ref>\nThe VHS and laser disc releases retained the original spoken dialogue that called the character Darian.<ref name=\"Movie Chat\">{{cite web |url=https://moviechat.org/tt0106627/The-Crush/58c75aea6b51e905f67c165b/Adrian-or-Darian |title=Adrian or Darian? |work=moviechat.org}}</ref> The original theatrical trailer also refers to the character as Darian.<ref name=\"The Crush (1993) Trailer\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x22nhe6 |title=The Crush (1993) Trailer|date=2 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a 24% rating from critics based on 29 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042416-crush/|title=Rotten Tomatoes ratings|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 20, 2021}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0106627|The Crush}}\n* {{AllMovie title|11676|The Crush}}\n* {{Mojo title|crushthe|The Crush}}\n* {{TCMDb title|18365|The Crush}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crush, The}}\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:1993 thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about stalking]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Juvenile sexuality in films]]\n[[Category:Morgan Creek Productions films]]\n[[Category:Teen thriller films]]\n[[Category:Thriller films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
