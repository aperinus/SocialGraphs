It follows brothers [[Mario]] ([[Bob Hoskins]]) and [[Luigi]] ([[John Leguizamo]]) in their quest to rescue [[Princess Daisy]] ([[Samantha Mathis]]) from a [[Dystopia|dystopic]] parallel universe ruled by the ruthless [[Bowser|King Koopa]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]).\n\nDevelopment began after producer [[Roland Joff\u00e9]] obtained the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' film rights from Nintendo. Given free creative license by Nintendo, which believed the ''Mario'' brand was strong enough for experimentation, the screenwriters envisioned ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a subversive comedy influenced by ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). The setting was inspired by the game ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990) with elements drawn from [[fairy tale]]s and contemporary American culture. The production innovated and introduced many filmmaking techniques now considered pivotal in the transition from practical to digital visual effects, including the use of [[Autodesk Flame]]. Filming took place from May to July 1992.\n\nReleased on May 28, 1993, ''Super Mario Bros.'' was a critical and [[Box-office bomb|financial failure]], grossing $38.9 million worldwide against a budget of $42\u201348 million. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the plot, inconsistent tone, and deviations from the source material, but praised the special effects, artistic direction, and cast performances. ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] appreciated the effort put into the film but felt it tried too hard to replicate the games instead of being entertaining on its own.<ref name=\"miyamoto\" />\n\nDespite appearing on several [[List of films considered the worst#Super Mario Bros.

The surviving dinosaurs cross into a new dimension, evolving into a humanoid race and founding the city of Dinohattan.\n\nIn 1973, a mysterious woman leaves a large egg, along with a rock, at a Catholic orphanage. As she attempts departure, [[Bowser|King Koopa]] accosts her, demanding the rock's location. Rocks then fall onto the woman, killing her. The egg hatches, containing an infant girl.\n\nTwenty years later, two Italian-American plumber brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] Mario live in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], close to being driven out of business by the mafia-operated Scapelli Construction Company led by Anthony Scapelli. Luigi falls for [[New York University|NYU]] student [[Princess Daisy|Daisy]], who is digging under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] for dinosaur bones. After a date, Daisy returns Luigi to the bridge and witnesses two of Scapelli's men sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open. Mario and Luigi fix it, but [[Iggy Koopa|Iggy]] and [[Characters in the Mario franchise#Non-boss antagonists|Spike]], Koopa's henchmen and cousins, knock them unconscious and kidnap Daisy. Upon awakening, the brothers pursue them through an interdimensional portal to Dinohattan.\n\nIggy and Spike realize they forgot Daisy's rock, a meteorite fragment that Koopa wants to obtain to merge his world with the human world. Daisy turns out to be the long-lost princess of the other dimension. When Koopa overthrew Daisy's father as king and devolved him into fungus, her mother the queen took her to Brooklyn. The portal was then sealed, but Scapelli's men inadvertently reopened the portal when they blasted the cave. Koopa sends his cousins to find Daisy and the rock to merge the dimensions and make him dictator of both worlds. However, after Koopa subjects them to an experiment to increase their intelligence, they realize Koopa's evil intentions and side with the Mario Bros. Daisy is taken to Koopa Tower, where she meets [[Yoshi]]. Koopa informs Daisy that she descended from the dinosaurs, believing only she can merge the worlds because of her royal heritage. The Mario Bros. rescue Daisy, aided by [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]], a good-natured guitarist who was devolved into a [[Goomba]], a semi-humanoid dinosaur, as punishment for a protest.\n\nKoopa's girlfriend Lena merges the two worlds, although the meteorite\u2019s energy kills her. Koopa devolves Scapelli into a chimpanzee before going after Mario, but Luigi and Daisy remove the fragment from the meteorite, and the worlds separate again. In Dinohattan, Mario and Luigi fire devolution guns at Koopa and blast him with a [[List of Mario franchise characters#Non-boss antagonists|Bob-omb]]. Koopa, now a ferocious, semi-humanoid ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', attempts to kill the Mario Bros., who permanently destroy him by devolving him into an actual ''Tyrannosaurus'', then [[Primordial soup|primeval slime]]. Daisy's father is restored as king, and the citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything with Koopa's likeness. Luigi professes his love for Daisy and wants her to come to Brooklyn with him, but Daisy, having found both her home and father, decides to stay in Dinohattan. Crestfallen, Luigi kisses Daisy goodbye as he and Mario return home to Brooklyn. Three weeks later, the Mario Bros. are getting ready for dinner when their story comes on the news and the anchorman says they should be called the \"Super Mario Bros.\" Daisy then arrives and asks the Mario Bros. to help her on a new mission.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mario|Mario Mario]]\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Luigi|Luigi Mario]]\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bowser|King Koopa]]\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as [[Princess Daisy]] and The Queen\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Iggy\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Spike\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Lena\n* [[Mojo Nixon]] as [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]\n** John Fifer as [[Goomba]] Toad\n* Dana Kaminski as Daniella\n* [[Francesca P.

Joff\u00e9 met the Nintendo of America president and [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]]'s son-in law, [[Minoru Arakawa]]. He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script. One month after their meeting, Joff\u00e9 went to Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi. He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project. Joff\u00e9 left with a $2 million contract giving the temporary control of the character of Mario over to Joff\u00e9. Nintendo retained merchandising rights for the film through a \"creative partnership\" with Lightmotive.<ref name=\"SuperLarge\">{{Cite news |last=Stayton |first=Richard |date=August 16, 1992 |title=The Bros.

However, Nintendo had no interest in creative control and believed the Mario brand was strong enough to allow an experiment with an outside industry. \"I think they looked at the movie as some sort of strange creature that was kind of rather intriguing to see if we could walk or not\", said Joff\u00e9.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{Cite magazine |last=Russell |first=Jamie |date=April 23, 2012 |title=Why the Super Mario Movie Sucked |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/04/generation-xbox-super-mario-movie |magazine=Wired}}</ref> Joff\u00e9 wondered, \"How do we catch this wonderful mixture of images and inputs and strangeness?\" The first screenplay was written by Oscar-winning screenwriter [[Barry Morrow]].

(Movie) Archive released a \"semi-official\" restoration of the extended cut of ''Super Mario Bros.'' The restorationists dubbed it \"The Morton-Jankel Cut,\" since it was based on an earlier VHS workprint of the film which had been discovered. Gilchrist was hired to get the most quality possible out of the low-quality VHS. The film is extended by twenty minutes in this cut, with additional scenes including Koopa devolving a technician into slime for the crime of sneezing, Mario's rivalry with the mafia-affiliated Scapelli plumbing company, and an anti-Koopa [[rap]] by Spike and Iggy at the Boom Boom Bar, backed up with scantily-clad lizard dancers. While the \"Morton-Jankel Cut\" was theoretically intended as an official Blu-ray extra, there are currently no plans for this to happen, and it was leaked to The Internet Archive instead. The Australian Blu-ray by Umbrella (released October 2021) uses a raw edit of the VHS workprint rather than Gilchrist's restoration.<ref name=\"ExtendedCut\">{{Cite web |last=Arbeiter |first=M. |date=June 2, 2021 |title=An extended cut of the Super Mario Bros movie has resurfaced|url=https://nerdist.com/article/super-mario-bros-movie-extended-cut/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602171712/https://nerdist.com/article/super-mario-bros-movie-extended-cut/ |archive-date=June 2, 2021 |access-date=June 4, 2021 |website=Nerdist}}</ref><ref name=\"ExtendedCut2\">{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2021/06/super-mario-bros-movie-restoration-morton-jankel-cut.html |url-status=live |title=An Interview With the Man Who Spent Countless Hours Restoring the Super Mario Bros.
