In creating a black comedy revolving around the \"lunatic characters\" of Heller's satirical [[anti-war]] [[novel]] set at a fictional Mediterranean base during [[World War II]], director [[Mike Nichols]] and screenwriter [[Buck Henry]] (also in the cast) worked on the film script for two years, converting Heller's complex novel to the medium of film.\n\nThe cast included [[Alan Arkin]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Martin Balsam]], [[Richard Benjamin]], Italian actress [[Olimpia Carlisi]], French comedian [[Marcel Dalio]], [[Art Garfunkel]] (his acting debut), [[Jack Gilford]], [[Charles Grodin]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Austin Pendleton]], [[Paula Prentiss]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Orson Welles]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:AL77A-126 (14334553607).jpg|thumb|262x262px|Plane crash from the film taken by a person on the set]]\nCaptain [[John Yossarian]], a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]], is stationed on the Mediterranean base on [[Pianosa]] during World War II. Along with his squadron members, Yossarian is committed to flying dangerous missions, but after watching friends die, he seeks a means of escape.\n\nWhile most crews are rotated out after twenty-five missions, his commanding officer, [[Colonel Cathcart]] keeps raising the minimum number of missions for this base before anyone can reach it, eventually to an unobtainable eighty missions; a figure resulting from Cathcart's craving for publicity, primarily a mention in the nationally syndicated ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' magazine.\n\nFutilely appealing to Cathcart, Yossarian learns that even a [[mental breakdown]] is no release when [[Doc Daneeka]] explains the \"Catch-22\" the Army Air Force employs: An airman would have to be crazy to fly more missions, and if he were crazy he would be unfit to fly. Yet, if an airman were to refuse to fly more missions, this would indicate that he is sane, which would mean that he would be fit to fly the missions, basically an impossible \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation.\n\nYossarian is haunted, in several recurring flashbacks during the film, by the bloody death of Snowden, the young turret gunner on his B-25. After Snowden's death, Yossarian temporarily refuses to wear his uniform, which Snowden bled on. He shows up at a medal ceremony naked, and later morosely sits naked in a tree, where he is visited by Lt. Milo Minderbinder, who rapidly progresses from squadron supply officer to a capitalistic tycoon involved in black-market money-making schemes. The bomber squadron is populated by many additional comically strange characters. Major Major Major, the squadron's operations officer, is promoted to a squadron commander without ever having flown in a plane, and refuses to see anyone in his office while he is in, instructing Sergeant Towser that people can see him when he's out. The person had to wait in the waiting room until Major Major Major was gone, then the visitor could go right in.\n\nTrapped by this convoluted logic, Yossarian watches as individuals in the squadron resort to unusual means to cope; Lt. [[Milo Minderbinder]] concocts elaborate black market schemes while crazed Captain \"Aarfy\" Aardvark commits murder to silence a girl he raped. Lieutenant Nately falls for a prostitute, [[Major Danby]] delivers goofy pep talks before every bomb run and Captain Orr keeps crashing at sea. Meanwhile, [[Nurse Duckett]] occasionally beds Yossarian.\n\nNately dies as a result of an agreement between Milo and the Germans, trading surplus cotton in exchange for the squadron bombing its own base. While on a pass, Yossarian shares this news with Captain [[Nately's Whore]], who then tries to kill him.\n\nBecause of Yossarian's constant complaints, Cathcart and Lt. [[Colonel Korn]] eventually agree to send him home, promising him a promotion to major and awarding him a medal for the fictitious saving of Cathcart's life; the only requirement being that Yossarian agrees to \"like\" the Colonels and praise them when he gets home.\n\nImmediately after agreeing to Cathcart's and Korn's plan, Yossarian survives an attempt on his life when stabbed by [[Nately's Whore]], who had disguised herself as a janitor. Once recovered, Yossarian learns from the chaplain and [[Major Danby]] that [[Orr (Catch-22)|Captain Orr's]] supposed death was a hoax and that Orr's repeated \"crash\" landings had been a subterfuge for practicing and planning his own escape from the madness. Yossarian is informed that Orr ditched the plane and paddled a rescue raft all the way to Sweden on his last run.\n\nYossarian decides to ditch the deal with Cathcart, leaps out of the hospital window, takes a raft from a damaged plane and, while a marching band practices for the ceremony to award Yossarian the promotion and medal, he hops into the sea, climbs into the raft and starts paddling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Catch-22 characters}}\n\nMain cast (as appearing in screen credits):\n{{Div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as [[Yossarian|Captain John Yossarian]] (Bombardier)\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as [[Orr (Catch-22)|Captain Orr]] (Bomber Pilot) \n* [[Martin Balsam]] as [[Colonel Cathcart|Colonel Chuck Cathcart]] (Group Commander, 256th Bomb Group)\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Major Danby (Group Operations Officer)\n* [[Susanne Benton]] as Dreedle's WAC\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Old Man in Whorehouse\n* [[Norman Fell]] as First Sgt.
