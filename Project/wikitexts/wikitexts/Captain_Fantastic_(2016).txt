They are former [[left-wing]] [[anarchist]] activists disillusioned with [[capitalism]] and American life, who choose to instill [[survivalist]] skills and left-wing politics and philosophy in their children.\n\nThey educate them to [[critical thinking|think critically]], and train them to be physically fit, athletic, and self-reliant without dependence on modern technology. They are raised to coexist with nature, and they celebrate [[Noam Chomsky]]'s birthday instead of [[Christmas]]. The children are accustomed to reading many forms of college-level literature, and, while showing high aptitude and intelligence beyond their years, they are socially awkward as they have not been socialized with the outside world.\n\nLeslie is hospitalized, away from her family and near her parents for [[bipolar disorder]] and eventually commits [[suicide]], leaving Ben to raise the children on his own. He learns that Leslie's father, Jack, plans to hold a [[Christian burial]] despite Leslie being a [[Buddhist]] who wished to be cremated. They argue over the phone, and Jack threatens to have Ben arrested if he attends the funeral. He initially decides not to go and prevents his children from doing so, but then changes his mind, leading his children on a road trip into life outside the wilderness.\n\nThe family briefly stays at the home of Ben's sister, Harper. She and her husband try to convince Ben the children should attend school to receive a conventional education; in response, Ben quizzes Harper's children and his children on various topics, illustrating that his children are better educated and embarrassing Harper and her husband. Ben arrives at Leslie's funeral with their children and reads her will, which instructs her family to cremate her and flush her ashes down a toilet. In response, Jack has Ben forcibly removed from the church. Ben tries to reason with Jack, but he still refuses to listen to him.\n\nDuring their road trip, some of Ben's children start to doubt him and his parenting skills. Rellian accuses him of failing to treat Leslie's mental health. Bodevan accuses him of not equipping them for the real world, showing him acceptance letters from several top [[Ivy League]] colleges, which Leslie had helped him apply to. Rellian tells Ben he wants to live with their grandparents, who want custody of all the children. When Vespyr tries to \"free\" Rellian from their grandparents, she falls from the roof and narrowly avoids breaking her neck. Ben, shocked and guilty, allows Jack to take his children. Although they have bonded with their grandparents, they quietly decide to follow Ben when he departs.\n\nThe children wish to honor Leslie's final wishes, and convince Ben to help them. Exhuming her corpse, they burn it on a [[funeral pyre]], flushing her ashes down an airport toilet. Bodevan then leaves the family to travel through [[Namibia]], while the rest settle into a more \"real world\" life on their farm. The final scene shows the family eating breakfast around the kitchen table with their father, waiting for the school bus to arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Ben Cash\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Jack Bertrang\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Harper Bertrang\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Dave\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Bodevan Cash\n* [[Samantha Isler]] as Kielyr Cash\n* [[Annalise Basso]] as Vespyr Cash\n* [[Nicholas Hamilton]] as Rellian Cash\n* Shree Crooks as Zaja Cash\n* [[Charlie Shotwell]] as Nai Cash\n* Trin Miller as Leslie Abigail Cash\n* Elijah Stevenson as Justin\n* Teddy Van Ee as Jackson\n* [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Claire McCune\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Ellen McCune\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Abigail Bertrang\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea of the movie started for Matt Ross as he began questioning the choices he and his wife were making as parents.
