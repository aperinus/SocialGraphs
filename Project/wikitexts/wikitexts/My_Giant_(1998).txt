The film stars [[Billy Crystal]], who also produced and co-wrote the story for the film, and Romanian [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[Gheorghe Mure\u0219an]] in his only film appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/327296/My-Giant/full-credits.html|accessdate=19 April 2016|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|title=My Giant}}</ref> David Seltzer's script was inspired by Crystal's friendship with professional wrestler [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], whom he had met during the filming of ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA struggling talent agent and [[huckster]] Sammy Kamin travels to Romania on business after splitting up with his wife. After his young client fires him, Sammy crashes his car and is rescued, while unconscious, by an enormous Romanian man named Max who is close to 8 feet tall.\n\nSammy thinks the rescuer is [[God]], as he can only see Max's giant hands. When Sammy wakes up, he thinks he is in [[Heaven]]. But he is confused to find a statue of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] next to his bed, as he was raised Jewish. He then realizes Max has brought him to a monastery, where he was raised after being given up for [[adoption]] by his parents because of his height.\n\nOnce he wakes up and interacts with Max, he sees potential stardom in him. Sammy attempts to broker his introduction into the movies. In doing so, he exploits Max' desire to visit a long-lost paramour, Lilliana, in [[Gallup, New Mexico]]. First, Max obtains the role of a villain in a movie, but he is so drunk that he vomits on the protagonist (Sammy's former client). However, the scene is included in the movie.\n\nOne day, Sammy talks to [[Steven Seagal]] about including Max as a villain in one of his movies, convincing him that he needs a different kind of villain. At first Seagal rejects him because there was another actor who would take that role, but he changes his opinion after listening to an extract of a [[Shakespeare]]an play done by Max.\n\nSuddenly, after some medical exams, Max is diagnosed with [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] which cannot be treated with a transplant because his heart is so big. Sammy decides to find Lilliana, and tries to convince her to meet Max again, but she rejects the invitation. Sammy then convinces his wife to take the role of Lilliana and after some words, Max asks her for a kiss.\n\nAfterwards, Sammy and his wife decide to get back together again, after realizing that they were truly in love and that their son needed them.\n\nSam got Max a three picture deal and tv series deal, but they left the business out on top. Sammy eventually decides to return Max home to Romania. Max refuses to go back, but finally he enters his old house, and meets his parents again and reconcile with him. Max died after a year or two. Sammy ends up watching Max's first filmed scene in a cinema with his family. Max dies shortly after, because of his heart, but he changed many people's lives forever.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Sammy Kamin\n* [[Gheorghe Mure\u0219an]] as Maximus \"Max\" Zamfirescu\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Serena Kamin\n* [[Joanna Pacu\u0142a]] as Lilliana Rotaru\n* Zane Carney as Nick Kamin\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Partlow\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as himself\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Rose Kaminski\n* [[Jere Burns]] as Weller, the Movie Director \n* [[Raymond O'Connor]] as Eddie \n* [[Rider Strong]] as Justin Allen\n* [[Lorna Luft]] as Joanne\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Milt Kaminski\n* [[Carl Ballantine]] as Rabbi\n* [[Eric Lloyd]] as Young Sammy\n* [[Ajay Naidu]] as Hot Dog Vendor\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as Myrna\n* [[Philip Sterling]] as Uncle Nate\n* [[Max Goldblatt]] as Jerry\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Tough Guy #1\n* [[Heather Thomas]] as Showgirl\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Director\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Producer\n* [[Nicki Micheaux]] as P.A.

[[Roger Ebert]] stated: \"The movie, which could have been a funny send-up of Hollywood talent requirements, gets distracted by subplots...after its promising start, ''My Giant'' isn't a comedy about an agent and a giant, so much as the heartwarming tale of a guy who learns to be a better family man.\"<ref>{{cite web |author= Roger Ebert | author-link= Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/my-giant-1998 |title=My Giant - Review |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[CNN]]'s Paul Tatara stated: \"Crystal is Crystal throughout, and I still like him for it. Muresan, on the other hand, is sweet but, shall we say, a limited performer. He also speaks as if he's storing potatoes in his cheeks for the oncoming Romanian winter. He's not any good, but, then again, [[Harrison Ford]] would be hard pressed to pretend that he's 7-foot-7. \"My Giant\" would probably play better to children. There's an itty-bitty bit of swearing.
