The film stars Vince Vaughn and [[Owen Wilson]] as recently laid-off salesmen who attempt to compete with much younger and more technically skilled applicants for a job at [[Google]]. [[Rose Byrne]], [[Max Minghella]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Josh Brener]], [[Dylan O'Brien]], [[Tobit Raphael]], [[Tiya Sircar]], [[Josh Gad]], and [[Jessica Szohr]] also star.\n\n''The Internship'' is the second film with Vaughn and Wilson in the lead roles, after the 2005 film ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''; the two had also both appeared in the 2004 film ''[[Starsky & Hutch (film)|Starsky & Hutch]]''. This is also the second collaboration of Levy, Vaughn, and Stern after the 2012 film ''[[The Watch (2012 film)|The Watch]]'', and the third of Levy and Wilson after the first two ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' films.\n\nReleased on June 7, 2013, the film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $93 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter salesmen Billy McMahon and Nick Campbell's employer goes out of business, Billy applies for [[Google]] internships for Nick and himself. They are accepted due to their unorthodox interview answers, despite a lack of relevant experience and not being of traditional collegiate age. They will spend the summer competing in teams against other interns in a variety of tasks, with only members of the winning team guaranteed jobs with Google. Billy and Nick's team is led by Lyle, who constantly tries to act hip to hide his insecurities, and its other members are seen as rejects: the [[Problematic smartphone use|smartphone-addicted]] Stuart, the [[Tiger parenting|tiger-parented]] [[Filipinos|Filipino]] Yo-Yo, and [[Indian American]] nerd-related [[Kink (sexuality)|kink]] enthusiast Neha. Although Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha find Billy and Nick useless in the initial tasks, Billy rallies the team in a comeback that unifies them in a game of [[Quidditch (real-life sport)|quidditch]]. However, the team loses after an intern of the opposing team, Graham, cheats.\n\nWhen the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince their teammates to indulge in a wild night out, which includes going to a strip club. Lyle's drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while drunk, and win the task by earning the most downloads. Meanwhile, Nick has been flirting with an executive, Dana, with little success. When he begins attending technical presentations to impress her, he develops an interest in the material. Dana agrees to go on a date with Nick, and she invites him in at the end of the evening. While the teams prepare to staff the technical support hotline, Billy is offered technical information by an introvert named \"Headphones\", which helps him. However, the team loses because Billy fails to log his calls for review. Dejected, Billy leaves the [[Googleplex|Google campus]] and pursues a job selling mobility scooters.\n\nIn the final task, which is a sales challenge, teams must sign the largest possible company to begin advertising with Google. Nick approaches Billy, and gives him an inspiring speech, encouraging Billy to return and help their team for the last challenge. Reinvigorated, Billy leads the team to show a local [[pizzeria]] owner how Google can help him interact with potential customers and thereby expand his business, while remaining true to his professional values. Chetty is about to announce that Graham's team has won, when Billy, Nick, and their team arrive to give a dynamic presentation about their new client. Chetty recognizes that although the pizzeria is not a large business, its potential is limitless because it is expanding via technology. Graham protests and is [[Dressing down|dressed down]] by Headphones, who turns out to be the head of [[Google Search]]. Nick and Billy's team win the challenge and the guaranteed jobs, while Graham is punched by an overweight member of his team who he constantly bullied. As the students depart, Nick and Dana are still seeing each other, as are Lyle and Google's dance instructor Marielena. Stuart and Neha have formed a romantic connection as well with Stuart promising to see her in person rather than texting her, and Yo-Yo asserts himself to his mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as William \"Billy\" McMahon\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Campbell\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Dana Simms\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Graham Hawtrey\n* [[Dylan O'Brien]] as Stuart Twombly\n* [[Josh Brener]] as Lyle Spaulding\n* [[Tiya Sircar]] as Neha Patel\n* [[Tobit Raphael]] as Yo-Yo Santos\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Roger Chetty\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Andrew \"Headphones\" Anderson\n* [[Eric Andr\u00e9]] as Sid\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Zach\n* [[John Goodman]] (''uncredited'') as Sammy Boscoe\n* [[Jessica Szohr]] as Marielena Gutierrez\n* Bruno Amato as Sal\n* [[B.
