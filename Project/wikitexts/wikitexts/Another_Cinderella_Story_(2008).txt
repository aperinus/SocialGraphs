The film stars [[Selena Gomez]], [[Drew Seeley]] and [[Jane Lynch]]. It is a sequel to ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' (2004) and the second installment in the [[A Cinderella Story (film series)|''A Cinderella Story'' series]]. Like the first film, it is a retelling of the ''[[Cinderella]]'' fairy tale in a modern setting. The film was released on DVD on September 16, 2008 and premiered on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] on January 18, 2009.\n\nThe film was followed by ''[[A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song]]'' (2011).\n\n==Plot==\nMary Santiago, a high school senior aspiring to become a dancer, was adopted by washed-up pop star Dominique Blatt, because her deceased mother was one of Dominique's dancers. At home, Dominique and her snobby daughters Britt and Bree treat Mary as a slave. While in school, Mary and her best friend Tami are bullied by Britt, Bree, and Joey Parker's ex-girlfriend, Natalia Faroush. Joey Parker, a famous celebrity and pop star, has returned to school for his senior year and to remember why he started dancing, accompanied by his best friend, Dustin/The Funk. He is also hosting a dance contest where the winner will be his partner in his next music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEF41MHILy5yIO |title=Damon Santostefano Brings Us Another Cinderella Story|publisher=[[MovieWeb]]}}</ref> It is revealed that Natalia is determined to get back together with him.\n\nJoey hosts a dance class that Natalia, Britt, and Bree attend. Mary sneaks behind the [[one-way mirror]] and is the only one able to match his moves, but her cell phone rings and she flees. Later, Dominique, hoping to revitalize her career, asks Joey to perform a duet with her while Britt and Bree hit on him, but he refuses and brings up a time Dominique insulted him on [[Total Request Live|TRL]].\n\nThe school holds a masquerade ball on [[Valentine's Day]], but Dominique plans to go partying and orders Mary to clean her room by midnight. Fortunately, Tami contacts her sister's boyfriend's family, who owns a cleaning service; and offers to help. Tami provides them with outfits for the ball. Joey and Mary stun everyone with their skills, but Britt and Bree spill a bowl of [[M&M's]] and Mary falls. Joey helps Mary up and takes his mask off, shocking her. Mary notices a clock and realizes she has fifteen minutes before Dominique arrives. She accidentally drops her [[Zune]], but returns home just in time.\n\nThe next day, Joey announces to the school that he has the Zune, saying whoever can announce the top four most played songs is the mystery girl. A bunch of girls (and a few boys) get in line and try to do it, obviously failing. Britt and Bree conclude Mary is the mystery girl and threatens to release an embarrassing video she made when she was eleven, if she tries to tell Joey. Tami convinces her not to care about that, and she tries to tell him, but he blows her off.\n\nAt Britt and Bree's birthday party, Dustin recognizes Tami as his dance partner and flirts with her having proved his identity. Mary tries to tell Joey again, but Britt and Bree play the video. Embarrassed, Mary runs to her room. She plays the song from the ball. Joey realizes she was the mystery girl and asks her on a date. Later, Mary receives a letter saying she has been accepted by the Manhattan Academy of Performing Arts, but when the academy calls to confirm it, Dominique answers and claims Mary has \"two broken legs\".\n\nAttempting to stop the date, Britt and Bree give Mary a ridiculous number of chores, but this backfires when Joey helps her by dancing through them. She helps him write his next song. He \"invites\" her to his house, but when she arrives, she sees through the window, Natalia talking to Joey in bed and runs off in tears. Dominique insincerely comforts her and claims the academy rejected her.\n\nJoey is confused when she gives him the cold shoulder. Dustin confronts Tami, who berates Joey for cheating on Mary. They clarify Natalia broke into his house to drive Mary away. Tami agrees to help them. The dance contest is near, and Tami and Dustin convince a still bitter Mary to attend. A Manhattan Academy representative is there at Joey's invitation. After Britt, Bree, and Natalia put on lackluster performances, Joey calls Mary to the stage and convinces her to dance with him. The duo performs the song they wrote. Joey admits that there's nothing going on between him and Natalia. Mary wins the contest and Natalia admits Mary did great. The representative reveals Dominique's lie and says Mary is accepted. Joey and Mary kiss. Dominique tries to leave the stage and falls, ironically breaking both of her legs.\n\nAs Mary, Joey, Tami, and Dustin load Mary's belongings in a van, a wheelchair-using Dominique begs her not to go as Joey and Mary share another kiss and drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In end credits order-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as Mary Santiago\n** Mia Aida Duran as Mary at 3 years old   \n** [[Nicole Mu\u00f1oz]] as Mary at 11 years old\n* [[Drew Seeley]] as Joey Parker\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Dominique Blatt\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Bree Blatt\n* [[Emily Perkins]] as Britt Blatt\n* [[Jessica Parker Kennedy]] as Tami\n* [[Marcus T.

Walker also gave it three out of five stars, praising the script, saying the writers \"peppered this story with a surprising dose of humor and some pleasing plot twists.\"  However, Walker specifically criticized the \"glaringly obvious\" age difference between the 15-year-old Gomez and the 26-year-old Seeley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/2008/anothercinderellastory2008.html|title=Another Cinderella Story Movie Review |publisher=christiananswers.net}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Another Cinderella Story (soundtrack)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1071358}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|454235}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=another_cinderella_story}}\n* {{tcmdb title|729492}}\n\n{{A Cinderella Story}}\n{{Damon Santostefano}}\n{{Cinderella (Fairy tale)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Another Cinderella Story}}\n[[Category:A Cinderella Story (film series)]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2008 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s dance films]]\n[[Category:2000s high school films]]\n[[Category:2000s hip hop films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:American dance films]]\n[[Category:American direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:American high school films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen musical films]]\n[[Category:American teen romance films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video comedy films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Cinderella]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Damon Santostefano]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Paesano]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2008]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Valentine's Day in films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
