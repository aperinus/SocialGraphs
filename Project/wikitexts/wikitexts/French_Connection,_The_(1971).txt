The screenplay, written by [[Ernest Tidyman]], is based on [[Robin Moore]]'s [[The French Connection (book)|1969 book of the same name]]. It tells the story of [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]], in pursuit of wealthy French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier. The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] as Popeye, [[Roy Scheider]] as Cloudy, and [[Fernando Rey]] as Charnier. [[Tony Lo Bianco]] and [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] also star.\n\nAt the [[44th Academy Awards]], the film earned eight nominations and won five for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Hackman), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Scheider), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]. Tidyman also received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]], and an [[Edgar Award]] for his screenplay. A sequel, ''[[French Connection II]]'', followed in 1975 with Hackman and Rey reprising their roles.\n\nConsidered one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], ''The French Connection'' appeared in the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the best American films [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|in 1998]] and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|again in 2007]].

The policeman is murdered by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32&nbsp;million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to [[New York City|New York]] by ship. In New York City, detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld. Popeye learns that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive within two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\n\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase while Weinstock urges patience, knowing they are being investigated. Charnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway [[42nd Street Shuttle|shuttle]] at [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street station|Grand Central Station]]. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in [[France]] before a replacement is assigned. Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye shouts to a policeman on the train to stop Nicoli and then commandeers a car. He gives chase, accidentally crashing into several vehicles on the way.\n\nRealizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the [[Motorman (rail transportation)|motorman]] at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman has a heart attack  and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. A battered Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye. After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team tear the car apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty handed. Then, Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize that the [[contraband]] must still be in the car. Finally, they remove the rocker panels and discover the hidden packages of heroin. The police return the car to Devereaux, who delivers it to Charnier.\n\nCharnier drives to an old factory on [[Wards Island]] to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and [[Freezing-point depression#Explanation|confirms its quality]]. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender. Charnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard. Title cards describe the fates of various characters. Weinstock was indicted, but his case was dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca (Sal\u2019s brother, an accessory to the handoff) received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Detective [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]]\n* [[Fernando Rey]] as Alain \"Frog One\" Charnier\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Detective Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo\n* [[Tony Lo Bianco]] as Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Pierre \"Frog Two\" Nicoli\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale]] as Henri Devereaux\n* [[Bill Hickman]] as FBI Agent Bill Mulderig\n* Ann Rebbot as Mrs. Marie Charnier\n* Harold Gary as Joel Weinstock\n* Arlene Farber as Angie Boca\n* [[Eddie Egan]] as Captain Walt Simonson\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Ernotte]] as La Valle\n* [[Sonny Grosso]] as FBI Agent Clyde Klein\n* [[Randy Jurgensen]] as Police Sergeant\n* Alan Weeks as Pusher\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally set up at [[National General Pictures]] but they later dropped it and [[Richard Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered to make it at Fox with a production budget of $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=AFI>{{AFI film|id=53919}}</ref> The film came in $300,000 over budget at a total cost of $1.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=Bart/>\n\nIn an [[audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentary]] track recorded by Friedkin for the Collector's Edition DVD release of the film, Friedkin notes that the film's documentary-like realism was the direct result of the influence of having seen ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'', a French film by [[Costa-Gavras]]. Friedkin mentioned the film's influence on him when directing ''The French Connection'': {{Quotation|\"After I saw ''Z'', I realized how I could shoot ''The French Connection''. Because he shot ''Z'' like a documentary. It was a fiction film but it was made like it was actually happening. Like the camera didn't know what was gonna happen next. And that is an induced technique. It looks like he happened upon the scene and captured what was going on as you do in a documentary. My first films were documentaries too. So I understood what he was doing but I never thought you could do that in a feature at that time until I saw ''Z''.\"<ref>{{cite web | title=William Friedkin's Favorite Films of all Time | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-APzEjrklc | via=YouTube | work=[[Fade In (magazine)|Fade In Magazine]] | access-date=January 20, 2022}}</ref> }}  The film was among the earliest to [[List of films featuring the World Trade Center|show the World Trade Center]]: the completed North Tower and the partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of the scenes at the shipyard following Devereaux's arrival in New York.\n\nFriedkin credits his decision to direct the movie to a discussion with film director [[Howard Hawks]], whose daughter was living with Friedkin at the time. Friedkin asked Hawks what he thought of his movies, to which Hawks bluntly replied that they were \"lousy.\" Instead Hawks recommended that he \"Make a good chase. Make one better than anyone's done.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=McCarthy | first=Todd | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UCUWDSEkM8C&dq=make+a+good+chase+howard+hawks&pg=PA625 | title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526053952/http://books.google.com/books?id=7UCUWDSEkM8C&pg=PA625&dq=make+a+good+chase+howard+hawks&hl=en&ei=FpJpTNOFBY6HnQeWwpzDBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=make%20a%20good%20chase%20howard%20hawks&f=false | archive-date=May 26, 2013 | page=625 | publisher=Grove Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-8021-3740-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-3740-1}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThough the cast ultimately proved to be one of the film's greatest strengths, Friedkin had problems with casting choices from the start. He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead, and actually first considered [[Paul Newman]] (out of the budget range), then [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Peter Boyle]] and a New York columnist, [[Jimmy Breslin]], who had never acted before.<ref group=Note name=Making>Friedkin recounts his casting opinions in ''Making the Connection: The Untold Stories'' (2001). Extra feature on 2001 Five Star Collection edition of DVD release.</ref> However, Gleason, at that time, was considered box-office poison by the studio after his film ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, which was required of Popeye's character for an integral car chase scene. [[Steve McQueen]] was also considered, but he did not want to do another police film after ''[[Bullitt]]'' and, as with Newman, his fee would have exceeded the movie's budget. Tough guy [[Charles Bronson]] was also considered for the role. [[Lee Marvin]], [[James Caan]], and [[Robert Mitchum]] were also considered; all turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://splicetoday.com/moving-pictures/the-making-of-the-french-connection|title = The Making of the French Connection}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2016/10/08/the-french-connection-facts/amp/|title=23 Things You Never Knew About 'The French Connection'}}</ref> Friedkin almost settled for [[Rod Taylor]] (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before he went with Hackman.\n\nThe casting of Fernando Rey as the main French heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (irreverently referred to throughout the film as \"Frog One\"), resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s 1967 French film ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' and had been impressed by the performance of [[Francisco Rabal]], who had a small role in the film. However, Friedkin did not know his name, and remembered only that he was a Spanish actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director instead contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other films directed by Bu\u00f1uel. After Rabal was finally reached, they discovered he spoke neither French nor English, and Rey was kept in the film.<ref group=Note name=Making/> After screening the film's final cut, Rey's French was deemed unacceptable by the filmmakers. They decided to dub his French while preserving his English dialogue.\n\n===Comparison to actual people and events===\nThe plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] came to the United States through France (''see'' [[French Connection]]).<ref name=\"NYT1972\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/06/archives/the-french-connection-in-real-life-super-sleuths.html|last1=Collins|first1=Larry|last2=Lapierre|first2=Dominique|title=The French Connection\u2014In Real Life|work=The New York Times|date=February 6, 1972|access-date=October 18, 2020|archive-date=October 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020230745/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/06/archives/the-french-connection-in-real-life-super-sleuths.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 1968, a record-setting seizure of {{convert|246|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of heroin was made, concealed in a [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] and smuggled to [[New York City|New York]] on the {{SS|France|1960|6}} ocean liner.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/406671233/ | title=Agents Seize Heroin Worth Record 22M | work=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]] | location=New York | date=June 27, 1968 | access-date=October 18, 2020 | archive-date=October 24, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024140051/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/406671233/ | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/27/archives/224million-in-heroin-found-in-car-at-city-pier-narcotics-secreted.html |last=Bigart |first=Homer |title=$22.4-Million in Heroin Found in Car at City Pier; Narcotics, Secreted in Auto Sent From France, Called Largest Seizure in U.S. $22.4-Million in Heroin Is Found Hidden in a Car at Pier in City |work=The New York Times |date=June 27, 1968 |access-date=October 18, 2020 |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021094307/https://www.nytimes.com/1968/06/27/archives/224million-in-heroin-found-in-car-at-city-pier-narcotics-secreted.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=DS19680626.2.5&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 | title=Biggest Heroin Haul Told | work=[[The Desert Sun]] | location=[[Palm Springs, California]] | date=June 26, 1968 | access-date=October 18, 2020 | archive-date=October 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022063353/https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=DS19680626.2.5&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 | url-status=live}}</ref> The total amount smuggled during the many transatlantic voyages of this DS was {{convert|1606|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} according to arrested smuggler Jacques Bousquet.<ref name=\"Quarterly\">{{cite journal |last=Cox |first=Michael |title=Smuggler |journal=The Citro\u00ebn Quarterly |page=11 |volume=9 |date=Spring 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the two main protagonists, several of the fictional characters depicted in the film also have real-life counterparts.

The scene was filmed in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]], roughly running under the [[BMT West End Line]] (currently the {{NYCS trains|West End}}, then the [[B (New York City Subway service)|B]] train) which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the [[62nd Street (BMT West End Line)|62nd Street]] station.  At that point, the train hits a [[train stop]], but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.<ref group=Note>[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42 cars]] 4572 and 4573 were chosen for the film and had no [[B (New York City Subway service)|B subway]] [[rollsign]]s because they were normally assigned to the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N subway train]]. Consequently, they operated during the movie with an N displayed. As of July 2009, these cars were withdrawn from service, but are preserved as part of the [[New York Transit Museum]] fleet.</ref>\n\nThe most famous shot of the chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of photography [[Owen Roizman]] wrote in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed; this effect can be seen on a car at a red light whose exhaust pipe is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film.<ref>This account of the shooting is described in ''Making the Connection'', supra.</ref> Friedkin said that he used [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s cover of [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]'s song \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence, though the song does not appear in the film, \"it [the chase scene] did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the
