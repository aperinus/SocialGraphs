Brittany's group of friends make comments about how much Adrien looks like Brittany's older sister Sandra who had moved away. At first she enjoys being a close confidant of Brittany but Adrien soon begins to discover how twisted Brittany actually is when Matt Curtis, an object of Brittany's affection, begins to show an interest in Adrien.\n\nBrittany sets out to get rid of Adrien, by stealing her file from Henry's office and discovers Adrien's past. Adrien's revelation of Brittany is much more disturbing, when she discovers that Sandra used to be \"queen bee\" of this circle of friends and that she often treated Brittany badly. Brittany is furious that her best friend Kelly deceived her when she overhears her explaining the situation of her missing sister to Adrien. To keep her secret under wraps, she drowns Kelly and later kills Henry, pinning the blame on Adrien. Her supervisor knew about Adrien's stay at the mental institution and readily believes Adrien to be the killer.\n\nWith the help of Bobby, one of Brittany's friends, Adrien escapes the mental institution. Adrien heads back to the country club, where everyone is attending an end-of-summer party. Using the information that Kelly told her, and putting together some odds and ends Adrien realizes that Brittany had actually killed Sandra and faked her moving away. Adrien shows up at the country club dressed as Sandra. Brittany sees who she believes to be her sister and starts to freak out. Brittany heads to the woods and unearths Sandra's body, just to prove that she is, in fact dead.  Adrien confronts her, and is attacked by Brittany and just before she tries to murder her, verbally confesses why she killed her sister. Hearing the fight everyone gathers outside to witness that Brittany is insane and that she killed her sister. Adrien moves on and leaves the country club, and it is Brittany who ends up in the mental institution. The last scene shows Brittany using her beauty and womanly wiles on a male orderly, with the audience led to believe that she would more than likely escape the mental institution.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Susan Ward]] as Brittany Foster\n* [[Lori Heuring]] as Adrien Williams\n* [[Matthew Settle]] as Matt Curtis\n* Nathan Bexton as Bobby\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Dr. Amanda Giles\n* [[Laurie Fortier]] as Kelly\n* Kim Murphy as Joanne\n* [[Jay R.

In the original R-rated version, Brittany began to remove her dress where her breasts were revealed and then her dress was taken down to as low as her thighs.  In the PG-13 version, the scene was not extended beyond the exposure of Brittany's breasts. A kiss between Brittany and Kelly was also trimmed for the film to receive the PG-13 rating.<ref>Berardinelli, James (2000){{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/i/in_crowd.html|title=The In Crowd|publisher=reelviews.net|access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nIn the United States, [[Warner Home Video]] released the PG-13 version ''The In Crowd'' in VHS format on 28 November 2000.  On 1 June 2004, it was released on DVD, in a [[snap case]] cover, like many other [[Morgan Creek Productions|Morgan Creek]] DVD releases. In the UK, the film received a VHS release on 22 April 2002. Although it is rated 12 in the UK, which is usually the equivalent of a PG-13 in the United States, it is, in fact the R-rated version, containing the full sexual scene between Brittany and Henry and the kiss between Brittany and Kelly. The DVD was released in the UK on 18 September 2002.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The In Crowd'' was universally panned by critics, who thought the film was \"unintentionally funny\" when it should have been intense.<ref>Mitchell, Elvis (20 July 2000){{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/072000in-crowd-film-review.html|title=Out of the Asylum, Into the Rich Club|work=nytimes.com|access-date=14 October 2011}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 2% approval rating based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 2.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"A dull, soapy potboiler that lacks the energy to qualify as a guilty pleasure, ''The In Crowd'' is undone by slow pacing, poor acting, and a stunning lack of originality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1098652-in_crowd|title=The In Crowd|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=5 November 2022}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"enjoyable [[camp (style)|camp]].\"<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117918629/ | title= Swimfan| date= September 8, 2002 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first=Scott | last=Foundas|access-date= 2010-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0163676|title=The In Crowd}}\n*{{Amg movie|198449|The In Crowd}}\n\n{{Mary Lambert}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:In Crowd, The}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American teen films]]\n[[Category:2000 thriller films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Morgan Creek Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mary Lambert]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jeff Rona]]\n[[Category:2000s teen films]]\n[[Category:Sororicide in fiction]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
