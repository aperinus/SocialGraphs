[[Victor Young]] contributed the musical score, including a fast-paced variation of the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'' for the opening scenes. Typical of a Sturges film, the pacing and dialogue of ''The Palm Beach Story'' are very fast.\n\n==Plot==\nInventor Tom Jeffers and his wife Gerry are down on their luck financially. Married for five years, the couple are still waiting for Tom's ship to come in. Anxious for the finer things in a life she's no longer enjoying, Gerry decides that they both would be better off if they split. Before she can act she ends up entangled with the Wienie King, a strange old man being shown round her apartment with his wife by a building manager anxious to rent it out from beneath his delinquent tenants.  Sympathetic to her plight - and utterly taken by her youth and charm - the man gives her $700 from the giant roll of cash he keeps in his pocket. This is enough to get their rent current, pay off their most urgent bills, buy a new dress, take Tom to an expensive dinner, and still leave $14 and change pocket money for him.\n\nIn spite of a night of amour that followed their tipsy return home, she awakens early, packs a bag, and makes for the train station. Bound for Palm Beach, Florida, her plan is to get a divorce, meet a wealthy man who can both give her what she craves and also help Tom, and marry him. Penniless, and repeatedly escaping from Tom's clutches, she is invited to travel gratis as guest of the rich and soused Ale and Quail Club on their private car.\n\nWhen it proves too rowdy, she flees for an upper berth in a nearby [[Pullman car]], in the process meeting the meek, eccentric, but amiable John D. Hackensacker III, who begins to fall for her immediately.\n\n[[Image:Palm Beach Story McCrea Colbert trailer screenshot3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Joel McCrea]] and [[Claudette Colbert]], stars of ''The Palm Beach Story'', from the trailer for the film]]\nLeft without even her clothes or purse in the chaos of her flight from the Ale and Quail reverie, she willingly accepts Hackensacker's initial chivalrous charity. Which takes a dramatic turn towards extravagance during a shopping spree for ladies finery he instigates in Jacksonville, swirling from trifles to ''haut couture'' and jewelry encrusted with precious stones.\n\nOnly when he hands over a card upon telling the store manager to charge it all to him is it revealed he is one of the richest men in the world and owner of the ''Erl King'', a fabulous yacht which the twosome board for the final leg to Palm Beach.\n\nBack in New York the despondent Tom receives the same kind of generous no-strings-attached charity from the Wienie King he had accused Gerry of trading sexual favors for, helping clear his mind.  The King encourages him to rent a plane, fly to Florida, and show up with a bouquet of roses to win back his bride.\n\nArriving at the railhead in Palm Beach Tom is directed to the dock for Hackensacker's yacht, where he sees the affectionate new couple still aboard. Failing to run him off on shore, a flustered Gerry introduces Tom as her brother, Captain McGlue. Hackensacker's oft-married, man-hungry sister, Princess Centimillia, is immediately smitten with him, and dismisses her previous lover, still in tow, Toto, as a valet.\n\nWhen Gerry tells Hackensacker, who is working his way round to propose to her, that her \"brother\" is partners with her husband in the same investment, Hackensacker agrees to back it, saying he likes the Captain and it will keep it \"all in the family\" once they are married.\n\nInvited to stay at the Princess' estate, the Jeffers try valiantly to maintain their farce &ndash; Tom reluctantly, wrangling to win Gerry back, and Gerry determinedly seeking to stick to her original plan. Until, to the strains of Hackensacker crooning love songs over a rented orchestra assembled beneath their windows, the couple end up romantically entangled the same way they had their very last night together. With the same impassioned result.\n\nUnmasked the next morning, they are reunited as one and confess the ruse to the Hackensackers. After John agrees to finance Tom's invention as simply a \"good investment\", sans sentimentality, the matter is begged whether Tom and Gerry have a brother and sister. They do...''twins!''\n\nThere is an elaborate dual wedding, with Tom as best man and Gerry as matron of honor, John hand-in-hand with Gerry's sister and the Princess with Tom's brother. A title card tells us that they \"lived happily ever after...or did they?\", before credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Claudette Colbert]] as Geraldine \"Gerry\" Jeffers\n* [[Joel McCrea]] as Tom Jeffers (alias \"Captain McGlue\")\n* [[Mary Astor]] as The Princess Centimillia (Maud)\n* [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]] as John D.

Not only had he shuttled back and forth to Europe as a young man, his ex-wife Eleanor Hutton was an heiress who moved among the European aristocracy, and had once been wooed by Prince Jerome Rospigliosi-Gioeni. One scene in the film is based upon an incident that had happened to Sturges and his mother while traveling by train to Paris, where the car with their compartment and baggage was uncoupled while they were in the dining car.<ref name=tcmart>Stafford, Jeff [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=86154&category=Articles \"The Palm Beach Story\" (TCM article)]</ref>\n\nThe story Sturges came up with was entitled ''Is Marriage Necessary?'', which, along with an alternative, ''Is That Bad?'', became a working title for the film. The original title was rejected by [[Hays Office]] censors, who also rejected the script submitted by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] over its \"sex suggestive situations...and dialogue.\" In spite of changes the script was still tabled because of its \"light treatment of marriage and divorce\" and overt parodying of [[John D. Rockefeller]]. More changes were made, including reducing Princess Centimillia's divorces from eight to three (plus two annulments), before the script finally was approved.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=86154&category=Notes Notes]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rudy Vallee and Claudette Colbert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]] and [[Claudette Colbert]]]]\n[[Image:Palm Beach Story Astor McCrea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Astor]] and [[Joel McCrea]]]]\n\nThis was Sturges' second collaboration with Joel McCrea, following ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' from the previous year and they worked again on ''[[The Great Moment (1944 film)|The Great Moment]]'', filmed in 1942 (but released in 1944). Although Colbert and Sturges worked on ''[[The Big Pond]]'' (1930) and the first version of ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934), ''The Palm Beach Story'' was the only time they worked on a movie Sturges wrote and directed.\n\nThe movie was Rudy Vallee's first outright comedic role, and he gained a contract with Paramount,<ref name=tcmnotes /> as well as an award for Best Actor of 1942 from the [[National Board of Review]].<ref>Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:37136~T4 Awards]</ref> He appeared in Sturges' ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' and ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]''.\n\nMany members of Sturges' unofficial \"stock company\" of character actors appear in film, such as Al Bridges, Chester Conklin, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest, Robert Dudley, [[Byron Foulger]], Robert Greig, [[Harry Hayden]], Arthur Hoyt, Torben Meyer, Frank Moran, Charles R. Moore, Jack Norton, Franklin Pangborn, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal, [[Julius Tannen]] and Robert Warwick.\n\nThis was the seventh of ten films written by Preston Sturges in which William Demarest appeared.<ref>Demarest appeared in ''[[Diamond Jim]]'' (1935), ''[[Easy Living (1937 film)|Easy Living]]'' (1937), ''[[The Great McGinty]]'' (1940), ''[[Christmas in July (film)|Christmas in July]]'' (1940), ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941), ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' (1941), ''The Palm Beach Story'' (1942),  ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'' (1944), ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Great Moment (1944 film)|The Great Moment]]'' (1944)</ref>\n\nClaudette Colbert received $150,000 for her role, and Joel McCrea was paid $60,000.<ref name=tcmart />\n\nThe second unit did background shooting at [[Penn Station, New York#Original structure (1910\u20131963)|Penn Station]] in Manhattan.
