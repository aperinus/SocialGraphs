The film is based on the short story \"Steel\", written by [[Richard Matheson]], which was originally published in the May 1956 edition of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', and later adapted into [[Steel (The Twilight Zone)|a 1963 ''Twilight Zone'' episode]]. The film features a former boxer (Jackman) whose sport is now played by robots. He must build and train his own robot with his son. ''Real Steel'' was in development for several years before production began on June 24, 2010. Filming took place primarily in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. [[Animatronics|Animatronic]] robots were built for the film, and [[motion capture]] technology was used to depict the rodeo brawling of computer-generated robots and animatronics, respectively.\n\n''Real Steel'' was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] in Australia on October 6, 2011, and in the United States and Canada on October 7, 2011,<ref>{{cite news|last1=DiOrio|first1=Carl|title=Touchstone sets 'Real Steel' release for 2011|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/touchstone-sets-real-steel-release-92193|access-date=July 19, 2015|date=December 9, 2009|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> grossing nearly $300&nbsp;million at the box office. It received mixed reviews, with criticism towards the plot but praise for the visual effects, action sequences, and performances of the cast. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--WP:FILMS MOS for movie plots is word-count between 400 and 700 words. It is at 695 as of April 4, 2017-->\nIn 2020, human boxers are replaced by [[robot]]s. Former boxer Charlie Kenton owns Ambush until it is destroyed in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner, Ricky. Having bet with Ricky that Ambush would win, Charlie absconds before Ricky can collect.\n\nAfter the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max, a robot-boxing fan with nearly no contact with Charlie since his birth. Max's maternal aunt, Debra, and her wealthy husband, Marvin, want full custody. Charlie bargains to cede custody of Max for $100,000, half in advance, and Marvin negotiates that Charlie retain custody of Max for three months while Marvin and Debra go on vacation. Settling into a gym owned by Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, Charlie acquires the once-famous Noisy Boy, which is destroyed against another robot boxer, Midas. While scavenging for replacements in a junkyard, Max discovers Atom, an obsolete, dilapidated but mostly intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, with a rare \"shadow function\" to mirror and memorize handler or opponent movements.\n\nAt Max's behest, Charlie pits Atom against Metro and is victorious. Max integrates Noisy Boy's voice command hardware with Atom, and convinces Charlie to assist in streamlining Atom's movements. This results in a series of victories, culminating in Charlie being offered a fight in World Robot Boxing with Atom against national champion Twin Cities. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive. Charlie notices a hitch whenever Twin Cities throws a right punch, and exploits this to win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges undefeated global champion Zeus, with the audience squarely on their side. After the fight, Ricky and his two henchmen attack Charlie for bailing earlier and rob him and Max of their winnings, prompting a defeated and dejected Charlie to return Max to Debra.\n\nThis upsets Max, and when Charlie tries to convince him that living without him is better for Max, Max reveals he always wanted Charlie to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Tallet's Gym. While talking with Bailey about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie arranges the fight with Zeus, and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight.\n\nZeus dominates early, knocking Atom down with its first punch, though Atom survives the first round, stunning the audience. Ricky was cornered by fight bookmakers during his escape, having bet $100,000 with Finn on Atom's first-round defeat. Meanwhile, in the ring, Atom lands multiple punches and withstands further attacks but makes no definitive progress. Late in the fourth round, Atom's voice-response controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to fight Zeus with Atom's shadow function. Atom wards off Zeus long enough to deplete its power core, at which point Charlie directs Atom to begin its counterattack against a tired and helpless Zeus. With Zeus's programmers unable to compensate, the designer, Tak Mashido, intervenes and controls Zeus. Atom gives Zeus a sound beating, who barely avoids losing by knockout. Zeus wins by decision and remains undefeated, but with Mashido's group left humiliated by the near-loss and Zeus critically damaged. Atom is triumphantly labeled the people's champion as Max and Charlie celebrate despite the match result.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Charlie Kenton, a former boxer\n* [[Dakota Goyo]] as Max Kenton, Charlie's son\n* [[Evangeline Lilly]] as Bailey Tallet, a boxing gym owner and daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Finn, a friend of Charlie\n* [[Olga Fonda]] as Farra Lemkova, Tak Mashido's partner\n* [[Karl Yune]] as Tak Mashido, a robot fighting inventor and designer of Zeus\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Ricky\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Aunt Debra, Max's Aunt\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Marvin, Debra's husband\n* Gregory Sims as Bill Panner\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:ShawnLevyHughJackmanRealSteelJuly10.jpg|thumb|right|Director Levy on set with Jackman in July 2010]]\nBased on [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1956 short story \"Steel\",<ref name=\"star\" /> the original screenplay was written by [[Dan Gilroy]] and was purchased by DreamWorks for $850,000 in 2003 or 2005 (sources differ).<ref name=\"star\">{{cite journal | last1=Siegel | first1=Tatiana | last2=Graser | first2=Marc | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118011766 | title=Hugh Jackman to star in 'Real Steel' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November 23, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145546/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118011766 | archive-date= June 29, 2011| access-date=September 14, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"museum\">{{cite news | last1=Fernandez | first1=Jay A. | last2=Kit | first2=Borys | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shawn-levy-man-steel-88898 | title=Shawn Levy is new man of 'Steel' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=September 15, 2009 |access-date=September 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914192101/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shawn-levy-man-steel-88898 | archive-date= September 14, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> The project was one of 17 that DreamWorks took from [[Paramount Pictures]] when they split in 2008.<ref name=\"star\" /> Director [[Peter Berg]] expressed interest in the project in mid-2009 but went no further.<ref name=\"museum\" /> Levy was attached to the project in September 2009,<ref name=\"bots\">{{cite journal | last=Fleming | first=Michael | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008686 | title=Levy in for 'bots of 'Steel' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 15, 2009|access-date=September 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145300/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008686  | archive-date= June 29, 2011| url-status=live }}</ref> and Jackman was cast in the starring role in November for a $9&nbsp;million fee.<ref name=\"Salary\"/> In the same month, [[Steven Spielberg]] and Stacey Snider at DreamWorks greenlit the project.<!-- ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said insiders reported a budget of $80&nbsp;million.--><ref name=\"star\" /> Les Bohem and [[Jeremy Leven]] had worked on Gilroy's screenplay, but in 2009 John Gatins was working on a new draft.<ref name=\"museum\" /> When Levy joined the project, he worked with Gatins to revise the screenplay,<ref name=\"boxed\">{{cite journal | last=Fleming | first=Michael | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009393 | title=Hugh Jackman boxed in for Levy | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September 30, 2009 | access-date=September 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145326/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009393 | archive-date= June 29, 2011| url-status=live }}</ref> spending a total of six weeks fine-tuning the script.

In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an \"[[everyman]]\" who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a [[fencing]] mask that Meyer explained served to show \"his identity was a bit hidden, so you have to work harder to get to see him.\"<ref>\"Building The Bots\",  ''Real Steel'' Blu-Ray</ref> Executive producer [[Robert Zemeckis]] added that the mask \"became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face.\" Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.<ref name=comm/>\n\nFor scenes when computer-generated robots brawl, \"simulcam\" [[motion capture]] technology, developed for the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', was used.
