The film stars [[John Travolta]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Sam Trammell]], [[Amanda Schull]], [[Rebecca De Mornay]], [[Melissa Bolona]] and [[Luis Da Silva]]. [[Principal photography]] on the film began on March 9, 2015, in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. The film was released on December 16, 2016 by [[Lionsgate]], and received mostly negative reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{long plot|date=August 2020}}\nIn the midst of an unprecedented crime wave in the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]], Governor John Meserve ([[Patrick St. Esprit]]) gives a press conference about his crime reduction efforts. When questioned by protestors about a proposed pipeline, Meserve promises that he has commissioned an independent study of the pipeline. Abbie Hill ([[Amanda Schull]]) and her family are watching the press conference, and they are thrilled that the Governor has referenced the work that her mother Vivian Hill ([[Rebecca De Mornay]]) is doing.\n\nVivian heads to the airport to pick up her husband Stanley Hill ([[John Travolta]]), who has returned from a job interview to manage a factory in [[California]]. When they arrive at their car, they notice one of the tires is flat. Before Stanley can fix it, a man approaches and asks them for money. Stanley politely refuses, but another man sneaks up on Stanley and stuns him with a blow to the head. The first man stabs Vivian and takes her wallet. Stanley watches the men flee.\n\nThe police use Stanley's descriptions to quickly capture the man who killed Vivian. However, even though Stanley positively identifies him in a lineup, the corrupt cops Gibson and Walker immediately let him go. This enrages Stanley. After his wife's funeral, Stanley goes home and struggles with his desperation. He throws a bible across the room, which opens to the passage in Jeremiah 6:11, \"I am filled with the wrath of the Lord.\" Inspired, Stanley now goes by the name 'Wrath', and now that he knows the name of his wife's killer Charley 'Fly' Lawes, Wrath starts to stalk him. When he sees a carefree Charley on the street, Wrath goes home and retrieves a case from behind a wall. The case has several passports, foreign currencies, and several weapons. He calls Dennis ([[Christopher Meloni]]), his friend from Special Forces, and asks him for information about Charley and his crew. Dennis runs black ops from beneath a barbershop.\n\nWrath uses Dennis' intelligence to track down one of the men who attacked him at a local bar. As the man lies dying, he hints that Vivian's murder was more than just a robbery. Stanley and Dennis are photographed as they dispose of the body. A local Armenian crime lord from Detroit named Lemuel 'Lemi K' ([[Paul Sloan]]) is furious when he sees the photograph, and he orders hits on the men who killed one of his crew.\n\nStanley tracks down another man who was involved in the attack named Lars. He confronts him at a tattoo parlor, after getting the words 'I Am Wrath' tattooed on his back. After killing Lars, Stanley makes off with a bag full of drugs and money. Stanley and Dennis use the bag as bait to lure Charley to the VIP room at a Korean nightclub. Before being killed, Charley tells Stanley that Vivian's murder was ordered by Lemi K because she was too nosy. Looking through Vivian's files, Stanley discovers that her study had deemed the pipeline unsafe with an eighty-two percent chance of water contamination. Wrath realizes that Vivian's murder was orchestrated to cover up the results of her study.\n\nLemi tracks down Stanley's daughter, Abbie, and her little boy, and takes them hostage. Stanley and Dennis arrive and kill Lemi's men. Stanley questions Lemi, who reveals that the entire plot was organized by Governor Meserve. The corrupt cops, Gibson and Walker, arrive and shoot Lemi dead. After being subdued by Wrath and Dennis, Gibson explains that Lemi was blackmailing the Governor using an incriminating video of Meserve's son, forcing the police to keep Lemi's men out of jail. As part of the deal, Lemi agreed to do jobs for the Governor, such as the hit on Vivian. Wrath forces Gibson to drive him onto the grounds of the Governor's mansion (with Walker stuffed in the trunk of Gibson's car) where he blows up Gibson's car, killing him while Walker barely escapes. Then Wrath infiltrates the Governor's mansion and confronts Meserve, who admits what he's done, but plans to murder Wrath to complete the cover-up. After a fight, Stanley overpowers and kills Meserve. When police arrive and train sniper rifles on Stanley\u2014instructing him to drop his weapon\u2014he instead raises Meserve's shotgun, which prompts the snipers to shoot him down.\n\nFortunately, Stanley was wearing a bulletproof vest, so he survives\u2014he is recovering in a hospital. However, he soon learns that he will be denied a [[jury trial]] and will be facing a [[FISA Court]] instead. Furthermore, he is going to be transferred out of the hospital immediately\u2014without having had a chance to even see his daughter Abbie. She is convinced that Wrath will be sent to someplace where he will never be seen again. She bursts into Wrath's hospital room to give him a farewell hug. After the scene is cleared, the two police officers who are guarding Wrath's room are relieved by two replacement cops. One of the replacements is Walker\u2014now demoted to patrolman\u2014who moves into Wrath's room to assassinate him. However, Abbie had slipped Stanley a gun during their hug and he kills Walker as Dennis enters the room to help him escape. Abbie later receives a postcard from her father, in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], assuring her that he is doing fine.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Stanley Hill / Wrath<ref name=\"TravoltaCast\" />\n* [[Amanda Schull]] as Abbie Hill<ref name=SchullCast>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|title='12 Monkeys' Star Amanda Schull Joins John Travolta in 'I Am Wrath' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/12-monkeys-star-amanda-schull-782909|accessdate=March 26, 2015|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 23, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Vivian Hill<ref name=YIBADA>{{cite news|last1=Mendoza|first1=Jon|title='I Am Wrath': John Travolta Movie Starts Filming In Ohio; Stanley Hill's Residence Unveiled|url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/20822/20150319/wrath-john-travolta-movie-started-filming-ohio-stanley-hill-s.htm|accessdate=March 26, 2015|website=[[Yibada]]|date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Dennis <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-saban-films-buys-john-797042|title=Cannes: Saban Films Buys John Travolta's 'I Am Wrath' for North America (Exclusive)|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 20, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Sam Trammell]] as Detective Gibson<ref name=\"YIBADA\" />\n* Asante Jones as Detective Walker\n* [[Patrick St. Esprit]] as Governor John Meserve<ref name=EspritCast>{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Ken|title=Filming of Travolta 'Wrath' movie brings out crowds|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/03/18/travolta-i-am-wrath-filming.html|accessdate=March 27, 2015|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Sloan]] as Lemuel \"Lemi K\"\n* [[Luis Da Silva]] as Charley \"Fly\" Lawes<ref name=\"YIBADA\" />\n* Robert Forte Shannon III as Nate Milligan\n* James Logan as Lars, Tattoo Artist<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3212232/|title=I Am Wrath (2016)|website=[[IMDb]]|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Llysa Rie as Katya\n* Doris Morgado as Rosa\n* Caroline Kane as Jenna\n* Tommy Lafitte as Father Loomis\n* Jordan Whalen as Mike\n* Jayden Blake Cochran as Joey, Stanley's Grandson\n* [[Melissa Bolona]] as News Reporter #1\n\n==Title meaning==\nThe movie title comes from [[Jeremiah 6|Jeremiah chapter 6]], verse 11.
