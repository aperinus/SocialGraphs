''Picnic'' was [[28th Academy Awards|nominated for six Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won two.\n\nThe film dramatizes 24 hours in the life of a small Kansas town in the mid-20th century during the [[Labor Day]] holiday. It is the story of an outsider whose appearance disrupts and rearranges the lives of those with whom he comes into contact.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the morning of Labor Day 1955, [[vagrant]] Hal Carter arrives by freight train in a [[Kansas]] town to visit his [[fraternity]] friend Alan Benson. While staying with kindly Helen Potts, Hal also meets Alan's girlfriend, Madge Owens, Madge's sister Millie, and their mother. Alan is happy to see the \"same old Hal\" and shows Hal his family's sprawling grain elevator operations. Alan promises Hal a steady job as a \"wheat scooper\" and invites him to attend the town's Labor Day picnic.\n\nAt the picnic, Hal divides his attention between Madge, Millie, and middle-aged schoolteacher Rosemary, who has been brought to the picnic by store owner Howard Bevens. All three women end up fighting over Hal. Alan blames Hal for the mess and says he is ashamed that he brought Hal in the first place. By now a crowd is watching, and Hal flees into the darkness.\n\nMadge follows Hal to Alan's car and gets in with him. By the river, he tells her he was sent to [[reform school]] as a boy for stealing a motorcycle and that his whole life is a failure. They kiss. Outside Madge's house, they promise to meet after she finishes work the next evening. Hal drives back to Alan's house to return the car, but Alan has called the police and wants Hal arrested. Hal flees the house in Alan's car with the police following close behind. Hal shows up at Howard's apartment, asking to spend the night there. Howard is very understanding and now has his own worries: Rosemary has begged him to marry her. Back at the Owens house, Madge and Millie cry themselves to sleep in their shared room.\n\nThe next morning, Howard comes to the Owens house, intending to tell Rosemary he wants to wait, but at the sight of him she is overjoyed, thinking he has come to take her away. Howard wordlessly goes along with the misunderstanding. As he passes Madge on the stairs, he tells her Hal is hiding in the back seat of his car. Hal is able to slip away before the other women gleefully decorate Howard's car. While Howard and Rosemary happily drive off to the [[Ozarks]], Hal and Madge meet by a shed behind the house. He tells her that he loves her and asks her to meet him in [[Tulsa]], where they can marry and he can get a job at a hotel as a [[bellhop]] and elevator operator. Mrs. Owens finds them by the shed and threatens to call the police. Madge and Hal embrace and kiss. Hal runs to catch a passing freight train, crying out to Madge, \"You love me! You love me!\" Upstairs in their room, Millie tells Madge to \"do something bright\" for once in her life and go to Hal. Madge packs a small suitcase and, despite her mother's tears, boards a bus for Tulsa.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[William Holden]] as Hal Carter\n* [[Kim Novak]] as Marjorie 'Madge' Owens\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Rosemary Sydney\n* [[Betty Field]] as Flo Owens\n* [[Susan Strasberg]] as Millie Owens\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as Alan Benson\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Howard Bevans\n* [[Verna Felton]] as Helen Potts\n* [[Reta Shaw]] as Irma Kronkite\n* [[Raymond Bailey]] as Mr. Benson\n* [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] as Bomber\n\n==Production==\nColumbia acquired the rights to the play for $350,000 in September 1953.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Up Bids For Stage Plays|date=September 23, 1953|page=3|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety191-1953-09#page/n210/mode/1up|access-date=October 7, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''Picnic'' was cast, William Holden was already 37\u2014too old according to some to play the role of Hal Carter.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Regardless, Holden was \"happy to finish his [[Columbia Pictures]] [[studio system|contract]] with such a prestigious project\" despite the film paying him $30,000 instead of the $250,000 he would have otherwise earned.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/> ''Picnic'' was one of Kim Novak's early film roles, and this movie made her a star. In the film, Holden keeps his hair combed in an untidy fringe over his forehead and has the sleeves of his shirt rolled up throughout. He shaved his chest for the shirtless shots and was reportedly nervous about his dancing for the \"[[Moonglow (song)|Moonglow]]\" scene. Logan took him to Kansas roadhouses where he practiced steps in front of [[jukebox]]es with choreographer Miriam Nelson. Heavy thunderstorms with tornado warnings repeatedly interrupted shooting of the scene on location, and it was completed on a backlot in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where Holden (according to some sources){{specify|date=February 2014}} was \"dead drunk\" to calm his nerves.\n\nMillie, the independently minded girl who memorizes [[Shakespeare]] sonnets and rebels against her older sister, was an early role for [[Susan Strasberg]], the daughter of prominent [[method acting|Method]] drama teacher [[Lee Strasberg]]. [[Elizabeth Wilson]] had a bit part as one of the smirking schoolteachers. [[Verna Felton]], a longtime radio and TV character actor who was well-known to audiences in the 1950s, had a strong supporting role as neighbor Helen Potts. Bomber, the paperboy, was played by Nick Adams, an actor who dated [[Natalie Wood]] and was a friend of both [[James Dean]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Mr. Benson was played by Raymond Bailey (without his toupee), later known on television as ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'' banker [[Milburn Drysdale]]. [[Reta Shaw]], Elizabeth Wilson, and [[Arthur O'Connell]] recreated their roles from the original Broadway production.<ref>[[Picnic (play)]]</ref> This was [[Rosalind Russell]]'s first Hollywood movie after a big success on Broadway with her [[Tony Award]]-winning performance in ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' (1953).\n\nDuring filming of the actual picnic scenes in [[Halstead, Kansas]], a tornado swept through the area, forcing the cast and crew to take cover. While the storm spared the set, it devastated the nearby town of [[Udall, Kansas]], and the film crew drove their trucks and equipment there to help clean up the damage.<ref name=SOP>{{cite journal|last1=Shaffer|first1=Bill|title=The Summer of Picnic|journal=Kansas Heritage|date=Spring 2005|volume=13|issue=1|url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/heritage/2005spring_shaffer.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221010/https://www.kshs.org/publicat/heritage/2005spring_shaffer.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-10 |url-status=live|access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref>{{rp|10}}\n\n===Locations===\nThe extensive use of Kansas locations highlighted the naturalistic, small-town drama.

The merry-go-round and cable suspension footbridge, which spans the Little Arkansas River, are still located there.\n* [[Nickerson, Kansas|Nickerson]] is the location of the two adjacent houses used for the Owens family home and that of Mrs. Potts.  It is where Hal (William Holden) \"jumps a freight\" to go to Tulsa and where Madge boards a bus in the last scene.<ref name=SOP/>{{rp|11}}\n* [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], for the opening scene where Hal jumps off a train, then meets Alan (Cliff Robertson) at Alan's father's large house.

Betty Field is just right as Madge's wistful, once-beautiful mother, who years earlier ran away with a man like Hal, and Susan Strasberg does well in the role of Madge's tomboyish younger sister. [[George Duning]]'s wistful, [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]-influenced score captures the mood of heated yearning that not only engulfed the movie, but also defined the country's romantic ethos in the mid-'50s.\"<ref name=\"nyt1996\"/> \n<!-- By the end of the 20th century, critics were praising its resonant portrayal of small-town life in America during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] era, along with its melodic soundtrack and strong performances by a supporting cast, including Arthur O'Connell (reprising the role he played during ''Picnic''{{'}}s successful run on Broadway) and a young Susan Strasberg. A half-century later, both of these performances still drew wide praise. -->\n\n===Awards and honors===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! Award\n! Category\n! Nominee(s)\n!

Composed by [[George Duning]] and [[Steve Allen]] (although Allen's lyrics were not used in the film), the song is featured in the famous dance scene between Holden and Novak, wherein Columbia's musical director [[Morris Stoloff]] blended \"Theme from Picnic\" with the 1930s standard \"[[Moonglow (song)|Moonglow]]\". The two songs often were paired in later recordings by other artists. The soundtrack album reached number 23 on the ''Billboard'' charts. The ''Theme from Picnic'' was also a popular song recorded by the [[McGuire Sisters]], and was a top 10 hit in 1956.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LgXlQnsDK4C&q=moonglow+picnic+%22steve+allen%22&pg=PA23 |title=''The Billboard Book of Number Two Singles''.
