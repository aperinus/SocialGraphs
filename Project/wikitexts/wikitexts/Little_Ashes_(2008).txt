[[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] watches helplessly as the friendship between [[surrealist]] painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and the poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] develops into a love affair.\n\n''Little Ashes'' won the [[GLAAD Media Awards|GLAAD Media Award]] for \"Outstanding Film\u2212Limited Release\" during the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards - English Language Nominees |publisher=[[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] |year=2010 | url=http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees |access-date=21 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1922, 18-year-old [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] ([[Robert Pattinson]]) arrives at [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|art school]] in Madrid. The ''[[Residencia de Estudiantes]]'', or Students' Residence, is a modern environment which encourages Spain's brightest young minds. Salvador, who is determined to become a great artist, soon catches the attention of the ''Resi'''s social elite \u2014 poet [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] ([[Javier Beltr\u00e1n]]) and aspiring filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] ([[Matthew McNulty]]). Together, they form the nucleus of the most modern artist group in Madrid.\n\nTheir private lives become increasingly complex, as Federico ignores the advances of devoted friend and writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell), and Salvador himself feels the pull of Federico's magnetism. Luis, becoming increasingly isolated by the duo's closeness, decides to move to Paris to fulfill his own artistic ambitions. Meanwhile, Salvador and Federico leave Madrid to spend the summer at the seaside village of [[Cadaques]], at the home of Dal\u00ed's family.\n\nFederico finds himself accepted<ref>According to Ian Gibson, Lorca was \"utterly at home with his hosts and by now hopelessly involved with Salvador\"</ref> into the Dal\u00ed family as he and Salvador grow closer until, one night, their friendship becomes romantic.<ref>[http://www.ariafilms.co.uk/projects/LittleAshes.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401042334/http://www.ariafilms.co.uk/projects/LittleAshes.pdf |date=1 April 2010 }}</ref> Even as they draw closer, their relationship appears doomed. Luis visits them at university and becomes more suspicious and appalled by their apparent intimacy.\n\nSalvador finds Federico's obsession more than he is prepared to handle, and eventually leaves for Paris. Enveloped by the high society and decadence there, Salvador is soon entangled with [[Gala Dal\u00ed|Gala]] ([[Arly Jover]]), a married woman with a penchant for celebrities. When Federico visits, he finds his friend is a changed man, both in his life and his politics.\n\n==Background==\nDetails of the relationship between artist Salvador Dal\u00ed and poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca have long been the subject of speculation and debate among historians and biographers. In ''Little Ashes'', Dal\u00ed's and Lorca's feelings are shown deepening into a love affair that the sexually repressed painter tries (but fails) to consummate.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1936, during the course of their friendship, Dal\u00ed and Lorca exchanged numerous letters. The original manuscripts of Dal\u00ed's letters to Lorca are held by the ''Fundaci\u00f3n Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca'' in [[Madrid]], and those of Lorca to Dal\u00ed are held by ''Fundacion Gala-Salvador Dal\u00ed'' in [[Pubol]], as well as in private collections. While it is widely acknowledged that Lorca was infatuated with Dal\u00ed, for years the painter denied entering into a relationship with Lorca.\n\nDal\u00ed stated: {{blockquote|He was [[homosexual]], as everyone knows, and madly in love with me. He tried to screw me twice .... I was extremely annoyed, because I wasn't homosexual, and I wasn't interested in giving in. Besides, it hurts. So nothing came of it. But I felt awfully flattered vis-\u00e0-vis the prestige. Deep down I felt that he was a great poet and that I owe him a tiny bit of the Divine Dal\u00ed's asshole. He eventually bagged a young girl, and she replaced me in the sacrifice. Failing to get me to put my ass at his disposal, he swore that the girl's sacrifice was matched by his own: it was the first time he had ever slept with a woman.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/28/spain.books | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Were Spain's two artistic legends secret gay lovers? | first=David | last=Smith | date=28 October 2007 | access-date=11 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"conversations\">Bosquet, Alain, ''[http://www.ubu.com/historical/dali/dali_conversations.pdf Conversations with Dal\u00ed]'', 1969. p. 19\u201320.

When you look at the letters it's clear something more was going on there[...] It began as a friendship, became more intimate and moved to a physical level but Dal\u00ed found it difficult and couldn't carry on. He said they tried to have sex but it hurt, so they couldn't consummate the relationship.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>}}\n\nBiographer of both Dal\u00ed and Lorca, Ian Gibson, stated: \n{{blockquote|It depends how you define an affair, he [Dal\u00ed] was terrified of being touched by anyone, so I don't think Lorca got far.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>}}\n\nIn the repressed Spain of the mid 1930s, Lorca's homosexuality seems to have provided an additional thrill to those who assassinated him in 1936. Lorca's biographer Leslie Stainton has suggested that the killers made remarks about his sexual orientation{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]\n* [[Javier Beltr\u00e1n]] as [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]]\n* [[Matthew McNulty]] as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]\n* [[Marina Gatell]] as Magdalena\n* Bruno Oro as Paco\n* Esther Nubiola as Adela\n* Marc Pujol as Carlos\n* [[Arly Jover]] as [[Gala Dal\u00ed]]\n* Sim\u00f3n Andreu as Fernando del Valle\n* Vicky Pe\u00f1a as Magdalena's aunt\n* Rub\u00e9n Arroyo as Rafael\n* [[Diana G\u00f3mez]] as Ana Mar\u00eda\n* Pep Sais as Art Teacher\n* Joan Pic\u00f3 as Young Officer\n* Ferran Aud\u00ed as Guard 1\n* Adr\u00eda Allu\u00e9 as Guard 2\n* Ferran Lahoz as Se\u00f1or Milagro\n* Cristian Rodrigo as Young Journalist\n* Sue Flack as Madam\n* Adrian Devant as Puppeteer\n* Ram\u00f3n Enrich as Professor\n* Xavi Siles as Man 1\n* Philippa Goslett and Hannah R\u0169tzou as Federico's Sisters\n* Paco Alonso as Gypsy Singer\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\nThe title is taken from Salvador Dal\u00ed's 1927\u201328 painting ''Cenicitas'' (''Little Ashes'').<ref>[http://www.abcgallery.com/D/dali/dali2.html Colour reproduction of painting ''Cenicitas'']</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/11/02/2003385955/print |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329111907/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/11/02/2003385955/print |archive-date=29 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was originally called ''The Birth of Venus'', before being changed to ''Sterile Efforts'' and then finally ''Cenicitas''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Shameful life of Salvador Dal\u00ed p 162</ref> It was first displayed on 20 March 1929 in a Madrid exhibition.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed An Illustrated Life, [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]]</ref> It was again displayed in his first solo exhibition in Paris in June 1931.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed An Illustrated Life, Tate Publishing</ref> The painting is currently in the Dal\u00ed collection of the ''[[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda]]'' in Madrid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Little Ashes'' premiered at the 16th annual [[Raindance Film Festival]] in London.
