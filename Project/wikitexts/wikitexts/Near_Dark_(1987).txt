The plot follows a young man in a small [[Oklahoma]] town who becomes involved with a family of [[nomad]]ic American vampires.\n\nDespite performing poorly at the box office, critic reviews were generally positive. Over the years, the film has gained a [[cult film|cult following]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott |date=November 5, 2008 |title=The New Cult Canon: Near Dark |website=A.V.

Just before sunrise, she bites him on the neck and runs off. The rising sun causes Caleb's flesh to smoke and burn. Mae arrives with a group of roaming vampires in an RV and takes him away. The most psychotic of the vampires, Severen, wants to kill Caleb but Mae reveals that she has already turned him. Their [[charisma]]tic leader, Jesse Hooker, reluctantly agrees to allow Caleb to remain with them for a week to see if he can learn to hunt and gain the group's trust. Caleb is unwilling to kill to feed, which alienates him from the others. To protect him, Mae kills for him and then has him drink from her wrist.\n\nJesse's group enters a bar and kills the occupants. They set the bar on fire and flee the scene. All except Mae want to kill Caleb after he endangers them by letting the only living occupant escape, but after Caleb endangers himself to help them escape their motel room during a daylight police raid, Jesse and the others are grateful and temporarily mollified. A camaraderie commences, with Caleb asking Jesse how old he is and Jesse responding that he \"[[Confederate States of America|fought for the South]]\" (during the [[American Civil War]], 1861-1865), making him about 150 years old (Severen had earlier suggested he and Jesse started the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871).\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb's father has been searching for Jesse's group. A child vampire in the group, Homer, meets Caleb's sister, Sarah, and wants to turn her into his companion, but Caleb objects. While the group argues, Caleb's father arrives and holds them at gunpoint, demanding that Sarah be released. Jesse taunts him into shooting him, then regurgitates the bullet before wrestling the gun away. In the confusion, Sarah opens a door, letting in the sunlight and forcing the vampires back. Burning, Caleb escapes with his family.\n\nCaleb suggests they try giving him a [[blood transfusion]]. The transfusion unexpectedly reverses Caleb's transformation. That night, the vampires search for Caleb and Sarah. Mae distracts Caleb by trying to persuade him to return to her while the others kidnap his sister. Caleb discovers the kidnapping and his tires slashed but gives chase on horseback. When the horse shies and throws him, he is confronted by Severen. Caleb commandeers a [[Semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer]] and runs Severen over. The injured vampire suddenly appears on the hood of the truck and manages to rip apart the wiring in the engine. Caleb [[jackknifing|jackknifes]] the vehicle and jumps out as the truck explodes, killing Severen. Seeking revenge, Jesse and his girlfriend, Diamondback, pursue him but are forced to escape in their car as dawn breaks.\n\nAttempting to save Sarah, Mae breaks out of the back of the car with her. Mae's flesh begins to smoke as she is burned by the sun but she carries Sarah into Caleb's arms, taking refuge under his jacket. Homer attempts to follow, but as he runs he dies from exposure to the sun. Their sunproofing ruined, Jesse and Diamondback also begin to burn. They attempt to run Caleb and Sarah over but fail, dying as the car blows up. Mae awakens later, her burns now healed. She too has been given a transfusion and is cured. She and Caleb comfort each other in a reassuring hug as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adrian Pasdar]] as Caleb Colton\n* [[Jenny Wright]] as Mae\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Jesse Hooker\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Severen\n* [[Jenette Goldstein]] as Diamondback\n* [[Joshua John Miller]] as Homer\n* Marcie Leeds as Sarah Colton\n* [[Tim Thomerson]] as Loy Colton\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Plainclothes Police Officer\n* [[Roger Aaron Brown]] as Cajun Truck Driver\n* [[James LeGros]] as Teenage Cowboy\n* [[Billy Beck]] as Motel Manager\n* [[S.A.

However, there is also a much more obscure casting connection between ''Near Dark'' and the ''Terminator'' movies: Robert Winley, who played a biker in the bar scene in ''Near Dark'', and who had never been in any [[James Cameron]] movies at that time, later played the biker whose clothes, boots, and motorcycle are stolen by the T-800 in a very similar bar scene at the beginning of ''Terminator 2''. His characters are identified in the credits as \"Patron in bar\" for the former movie and \"Cigar Biker\" for the latter.\n\n==Production==\nVampire films had become \"trendy\" by the time of ''Near Dark'''s production, with the success of ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), the latter released two months before ''Near Dark'' and grossing $32 million.<ref name=haim>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=March 10, 2010 |title=Corey Haim's 'The Lost Boys' Was The Original Teen Vampire Flick |work=[[MTV.com]] |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/10/corey-haim-the-lost-boys-twilight/ |access-date=May 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313064531/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/10/corey-haim-the-lost-boys-twilight |archive-date=March 13, 2010}}</ref>\nKathryn Bigelow wanted to film a Western movie that departed from cinematic convention. When she and co-writer Eric Red found financial backing for a Western difficult to obtain, it was suggested to them that they try mixing a Western with another, more popular genre. Her interest in revisionist interpretation of cinematic tradition led her and Red to combine two genres that they regarded as ripe for reinterpretation: the Western movie and the vampire movie. The combination of the genres had been visited at least twice before on the big screen, with ''[[Curse of the Undead]]'' (1959) and ''[[Billy the Kid Versus Dracula]]'' (1966).\n\nBigelow knew (and later married) director [[James Cameron]], who directed ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), a film that shares three cast members (Paxton, Goldstein and Henriksen) with ''Near Dark''. Actor [[Michael Biehn]] was offered the role of Jesse Hooker, but he rejected the role because he found the script confusing. Lance Henriksen took over the role.<ref>[https://lebeauleblog.com/2014/03/08/what-the-hell-happened-to-michael-biehn/ ''What the Hell Happened to Michael Biehn?'' \u2013 Article on the website ''Lebeau's Le Blog'']</ref> A cinema seen in the background early in the film has ''Aliens'' on its marquee and Cameron played the man who \"[[Finger (gesture)|flips off]]\" Severen.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n'''''Near Dark''''' is the thirty-second major release and tenth soundtrack album by [[Tangerine Dream]].
