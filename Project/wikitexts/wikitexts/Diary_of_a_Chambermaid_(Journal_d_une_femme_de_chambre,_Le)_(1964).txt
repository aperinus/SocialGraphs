Though highly satirical and reflective of his typical anti-[[bourgeois]] sentiments, it is one of Bu\u00f1uel's more realistic films, and generally avoids the outlandish [[surrealist]] imagery and far-fetched plot twists found in many of his other works. The film was the first screenwriting collaboration between Bu\u00f1uel and [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]], who extensively reworked the 1900 [[The Diary of a Chambermaid (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Octave Mirbeau]]. Bu\u00f1uel and Carri\u00e8re would go on to collaborate on ''[[Belle de jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' (1967), ''[[The Milky Way (1969 film)|The Milky Way (1969)]]'', ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'' (1972), ''[[The Phantom of Liberty]]'' (1974) and ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'' (1977).\n\n==Plot==\nIn France in the early 1930s, C\u00e9lestine, a stylish and attractive young [[maid|chambermaid]] from Paris, arrives at a provincial estate and joins a household staff that includes a cook, a timid maid named Marianne, and Joseph, the [[Groom (profession)|groom]], who spends his evenings writing [[nationalism|nationalisic]], [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] leaflets with a friend. C\u00e9lestine was primarily hired to work for the elderly Monsieur Rabour, who insists on calling her Marie, which is the name he has used for all of his chambermaids, and likes to touch her leg while she reads to him and watch as she she walks around wearing certain shoes. She seems happy enough to oblige him, however, and he defends C\u00e9lestine from his daughter, Madame Monteil, when she breaks a lamp.\n\nMadame Monteil runs the household and is very particular about how things are done. She and her husband are not physically intimate due to her [[dyspareunia]], a problem with which the local priest has not been helpful, and Monsieur Monteil copes by expending his energy hunting small game in the surrounding woods and pursuing any woman who is nearby, including the former chambermaid, though C\u00e9lestine playfully manages to keep him at arm's length. Monsieur Monteil is also feuding with a neighbor, the retired Captain Mauger, who throws his garbage onto Rabour's property to get back at Monteil for hypocritically spreading rumors about his relationship with his own housekeeper, Rose.\n\nOne day, Rabour is found dead in his bed, clutching the pair of boots he had most recently had C\u00e9lestine wear for him. At around the same time, Joseph comes across Claire, a prepubescent peasant girl who often hangs around the kitchen at the estate, alone in the woods and rapes and kills her. The body is found six days later, shortly before C\u00e9lestine is to board a train back to Paris, having quit her job. She immediately suspects Joseph is the murderer and, as she had grown close to Clair, decides to get her job back and try to collect evidence to implicate him.\n\nJoseph, a fastidious man, notices when C\u00e9lestine searches his room. He confronts her and, although their interactions have always been confrontational and she openly accuses him of killing Claire, proceeds to declare his love for C\u00e9lestine, as he has come to feel they are the same inside. C\u00e9lestine tries to seduce Joseph, but he says they need to wait, since he wants more than a fling.\n\nAfter leaving the office of a judge without seeing him, C\u00e9lestine runs into Mauger. He tells her that he fired Rose, saying she had stopped doing housework and become controlling after 12 years in his employ and also would get jealous whenever he talked to C\u00e9lestine. Mauger then proposes, and C\u00e9lestine tells him that she will think it over.\n\nTo tempt Joseph, C\u00e9lestine waits for him in his bed, but he again resists. He says he plans to marry her and buy a caf\u00e9 in [[Cherbourg]] for them to run together, indicating he suspects an upcoming revolution will be good for business. She swears on a [[crucifix]] that she will marry him so he will sleep with her, and, as he climbs into bed, she tells him to admit he killed Claire, but he just tells her to shut up. Joseph and C\u00e9lestine announce their engagement, and Monsieur Monteil shifts his attentions from C\u00e9lestine to Marianne.\n\nC\u00e9lestine removes the metal toe plate from one of Joseph's shoes. While Joseph and his friend are making plans to attend a right-wing political rally, two police officers arrive and arrest the pair, having found the toe plate at the scene of Claire's murder. As he is being led away, Joseph tells C\u00e9lestine he was not wearing those shoes the day Claire was killed.\n\nThinking she has avenged Claire, C\u00e9lestine decides to marry Mauger. He waits on her and alters his will to leave her everything, but she treats him coolly. When she asks about Joseph, Mauger says he is to be released without a trial, given the lack of evidence against him.\n\nIn Cherbourg, Joseph cheers on a parade of nationalistic men as they march past his caf\u00e9, which his attractive younger wife has helped to fill with soldiers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Jeanne Moreau]] as C\u00e9lestine\n*[[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Joseph, Rabour's [[Groom (profession)|groom]]\n*[[Daniel Ivernel]] as Captain Mauger, Rabour's neighbor\n*[[Fran\u00e7oise Lugagne]] as Madame Monteil, Rabour's daughter\n*[[Muni (actress)|Muni]] as Marianne, Rabour's maid\n*Jean Ozenne as Monsieur Rabour\n*[[Michel Piccoli]] as Monsieur Monteil, Rabour's son-in-law\n*[[Jo\u00eblle Bernard]] as Joseph's wife\n*[[Fran\u00e7oise Bertin]] as a gossip\n*Aline Bertrand as a traveler who hears about Claire's death\n*[[Pierre Collet]] as a traveler who hears about Claire's death\n*Michel Dacquin (credited as Michel Dacquid) as a wedding guest\n*Madeleine Damien as Rabour's cook\n*[[Marc Eyraud]] as the judge's secretary\n*Jean Franval as the gossiping postman\n*[[Gilberte G\u00e9niat]] as Rose, Mauger's housekeeper\n*[[Gabriel Gobin]] as the senior policeman who arrests Joseph\n*[[Bernard Musson]] as the [[sacristan]], Joseph's friend\n*[[Jeanne P\u00e9rez]] (credited as Jeanne P\u00e9res) as a gossip\n*Marcel Rouz\u00e9 as the [[station master]]\n*Dominique Sauvage as \"little\" Claire\n*[[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] (credited as Andr\u00e9e Taincy) as a gossip\n*[[Geymond Vital]] as the senior policeman at the train station\n*[[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] as the priest\n*[[Claude Jaeger]] as the judge\n*[[Dominique Zardi]] as the junior policeman (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally intended as a vehicle for the Mexican actress [[Silvia Pinal]], who had starred in Bu\u00f1uel's earlier films ''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Exterminating Angel]]'' (1962).
