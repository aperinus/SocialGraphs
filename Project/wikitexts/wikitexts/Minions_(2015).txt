Directed by [[Pierre Coffin]] and [[Kyle Balda]] (in Balda's directorial debut), produced by [[Chris Meledandri]] and [[Janet Healy]], and written by [[Brian Lynch (writer)|Brian Lynch]], it stars the voices of Coffin as the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]] (including Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], and is narrated by [[Geoffrey Rush]]. It focuses on the Minions as they search for their new master.\n\n''Minions'' debuted in London on June 11, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 10. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animation, voice acting, and score, but criticized the character development and humor, which some called unfunny and inappropriate. It was a financial success at the box office, earning $1.159 billion worldwide, and became the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2015]], the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->10th<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->-highest-grossing film of all time]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->second<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->-highest-grossing animated film of all time]] during its theatrical run, and is to date the highest-grossing animated film not released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. A sequel, ''[[Minions: The Rise of Gru]]'', was released in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n[[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]] are small, yellow pill-shaped creatures which have existed since the beginning of time, evolving from [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]] into beings which exist only to serve history's most evil masters, but they accidentally end up killing all their masters: rolling a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|T. rex]]'' into a volcano, letting a caveman get eaten by a bear, crushing a [[Pharaoh]] to death with a pyramid, and exposing [[Count Dracula]] to sunlight. They are driven into isolation after firing a cannon at [[Napoleon]] while in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and start a new life inside a cave, but after many years, the Minions become sad and unmotivated without a master to serve. However, three Minions named Kevin, Stuart and Bob decide to go out on a quest to find a new master.\n\nThe three journey in 1968 to New York City, where they enter a department store for the night and stumble upon a hidden commercial broadcast advertising Villain-Con, a convention for all villains in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The next day, they manage to hitchhike a ride with the Nelsons, a family of thieves. At the convention, they meet Scarlet Overkill, the world's first female supervillain, who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in [[London]]. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join. Scarlet plans to steal the [[Imperial State Crown]] from [[Queen Elizabeth II]], promising to reward the Minions if they succeed, but also threatening to kill them if they fail.\n\nScarlet's husband Herb supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught while breaking into the [[Tower of London]]. During the subsequent chase, Bob slams into the [[King Arthur|Sword in the Stone]] and pulls the sword free to defend himself and his friends, removing the Queen from the throne and making Bob the new King. Enraged that someone else accomplished her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts Bob, who voluntarily abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred, Scarlet imprisons Kevin, Stuart and Bob in a dungeon, where Herb attempts to torture the trio, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet at her coronation.\n\nAfter making their way to [[Westminster Abbey]], Kevin, Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet. Mistaking the accident for an assassination attempt, Scarlet angrily orders the trio's execution and has other villains chase them through the streets of London during a thunderstorm. Stuart and Bob are captured, while Kevin hides in a pub and sees Scarlet on television, who declares that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons and triggers a machine Herb was building, causing him to grow in size into a giant. Kevin tramples through London, rescues his friends, and battles Scarlet, just as the other Minions turn up in the city. Scarlet tries to eradicate them by firing a massive missile, but Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket dress, only for Kevin to hold onto it and get pulled into the sky. The missile explodes, seemingly killing Kevin, Scarlet, and Herb. As the Minions mourn the loss of their leader, Kevin survives as he returns to his normal size.\n\nThe Queen gets her throne and crown back. She rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear Tim, Stuart with an electric guitar, and Kevin with a [[Knighthood (United Kingdom)|knighthood]]. Scarlet and Herb, still alive, steal the crown again, only to be stopped by a young [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]], who fires a freeze ray at them and flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike. The Minions, deciding Gru is the new master they were looking for, begin to follow him.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Pierre Coffin 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Pierre Coffin]] also voices the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]].]]\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Scarlet Overkill, the world's first female supervillain and Herb's wife<ref name=\"DeadlineBullock\" />\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Herb Overkill, a genius inventor and Scarlet's husband<ref name=\"DeadlineHamm\" />\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Walter Nelson, Madge's thief husband and Tina, Walter Jr. and Binky's father<ref name=\"ColliderNelsons\">{{cite web|last1=Nemiroff|first1=Perri|title=Minions Pictures: 11 Hi-Res Shots of Kevin, Stuart, Bob, Scarlet Overkill and More|url=https://collider.com/minions-pictures-11-hi-res-shots-of-kevin-stuart-bob-scarlet-overkill-and-more/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626035323/https://collider.com/minions-pictures-11-hi-res-shots-of-kevin-stuart-bob-scarlet-overkill-and-more/|archive-date=June 26, 2015|access-date=June 20, 2015|date=June 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Madge Nelson, Walter's thief wife and Tina, Walter Jr. and Binky's mother<ref name=\"Janney\">{{cite web|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Allison Janney Joins Tim Burton's 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children' (Exclusive)|url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/allison-janney-joins-tim-burtons-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-1201447041/|access-date=January 19, 2021|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221101007/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/allison-janney-joins-tim-burtons-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-1201447041/|archive-date=December 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as a Tower Guard<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n** Coogan also voices Professor Flux, a [[scientist]]\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* [[Pierre Coffin]] as the yellow, small [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]],<ref name=\"CoffinAndTheMinions\">{{cite news |last1=McGrath |first1=Nick |date=June 26, 2015 |title=Pierre Coffin: Me and my Minions - Life and style |website=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/26/pierre-coffin-me-and-my-minions |url-status=live |access-date=November 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230131546/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/26/pierre-coffin-me-and-my-minions |archive-date=December 30, 2015}}</ref> especially:\n** Kevin, the leader of the Minions, out to find a new master\n** Stuart, a musician, and the slacker of the three\n** Bob, the youngest and smallest of the thre\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as the Narrator<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Steve Carell]] reprises his role as [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]], who appears at the end of the film in his younger form.<ref name=\"BFI\" /> Other cast members include [[Katy Mixon]] as Tina Nelson, Walter and Madge's thief daughter;<ref name=\"BFI\" /> [[Michael Beattie (actor)|Michael Beattie]] as Walter Nelson Jr., Walter and Madge's thief son<ref name=\"BFI\" /> (Beattie also voices a VNC announcer);
