The screenplay by [[Tracy Letts]] is based on his 1993 [[Killer Joe (play)|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]] in the title role, [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Gina Gershon]] and [[Thomas Haden Church]]. Friedkin and Letts had also collaborated on the 2006 film ''[[Bug (2006 film)|Bug]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[West Dallas]], [[Texas]], 22-year-old drug dealer Chris Smith comes to the trailer park home of his dimwitted father Ansel and his cheating step-mother Sharla after his mother Adele, Ansel's ex-wife, threw Chris out of her house. To make matters worse, Adele stole his drugs he was supposed to sell and now owes the dealer money; now he Chris is desperate to pay off a $6,000 debt to his connection, Digger Soames. Chris tells Ansel that by killing Adele, they can collect on a $50,000 [[life insurance]] policy, of which Chris' sister Dottie is the sole [[beneficiary]]. Chris and Ansel agree that after paying a [[contract killing|hit man]] from the proceeds of the insurance policy, they will split the remainder four ways between themselves, Dottie, and Sharla. Dottie approves of the plan and Chris arranges a meeting with Joe Cooper, a [[Police officer|police]] [[detective]] who has a side career as a contract killer. Before the meeting, Dottie tells Joe that Adele tried to kill her once when she was an infant.\n\nSince Chris and Ansel are broke, the plan almost falls apart when Joe demands $25,000 in advance. However, Joe is interested in young Dottie, who is a virgin, and offers to take her as a \"retainer\" until the insurance money comes through. Joe seduces Dottie and they start a relationship. Digger has his goons beat Chris, injuring him badly, and threatens to have him killed unless he pays what he owes. Chris has a change of heart and asks Joe to call off the hit and stop seeing Dottie, only to discover that he has already killed Adele. With Chris' reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.\n\nAfter Adele's death, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adele's boyfriend, rather than Dottie. Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe, thereby duping Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Ansel blames Chris for the fiasco and tells him he should just kill himself. Chris tries to persuade Dottie to run away with him to escape Digger and Joe, both of whom expect to be paid. Dottie agrees to go with Chris if she can see Joe first.\n\nAfter Adele's funeral, Joe pulls Rex over in his car and Chris buys an illegal pistol. When Ansel and Sharla return home, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, leading her to admit that she knew the policy was really for $100,000, since [[Double indemnity|accidental death doubled the payout]]. Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, implying he is dead, as well as offering incriminating photos that prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe chokes and punches her and forces her to simulate [[oral sex]] on a [[Chicken drumstick|fried chicken drumstick]].\n\nJoe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away, and threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they don't stop him. After Chris arrives and is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris rejects this, ordering Dottie to leave with him; Joe tells her to stay where she is, but Dottie stands up and walks away as both men yell at her. When Chris threatens Joe with his gun, Sharla stabs Chris with a steak knife and Joe tackles him. Ansel and Sharla rush to assist Joe as he savagely beats Chris, not wanting to be killed if Chris flees with Dottie. Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends just as Dottie moves her finger to the trigger.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Detective Joe 'Killer Joe' Cooper\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Chris Smith\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Dottie Smith\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Sharla Smith\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Ansel Smith\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as 'Digger' Soames\n\n==Rating controversy==\n{{quote box\n|quote = Cutting ''would not'' have made it mass appeal.
