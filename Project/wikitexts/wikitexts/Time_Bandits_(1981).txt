It stars [[Sean Connery]], [[John Cleese]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Katherine Helmond]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Peter Vaughan]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]. The film tells the story of a young boy taken on an adventure through time with a band of thieves who plunder treasure from various points in history.\n\nIn 1979, Terry Gilliam was unable to set up the film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', therefore proposed a family film. ''Time Bandits'' was co-written with fellow [[Monty Python]] Michael Palin, financed by ex-[[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]'s [[HandMade Films]] and filmed in England, Morocco and Wales. The film was released in cinemas on 2 July 1981 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 1981 in the United States. On its initial release the film received mainly positive reviews from critics, opening at number one at the weekend box office in the US and Canada, and by the end of its run grossing $36 million on a budget of $5 million.\n\nGilliam has referred to ''Time Bandits'' as the first in his \"Trilogy of Imagination\", followed by ''Brazil'' (1985) and ending with ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988).\n\n==Plot==\nKevin is an eleven-year-old boy fascinated by history, particularly that of [[Ancient Greece]]. His parents ignore his activities, having become obsessed with buying the latest household gadgets. One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts out of his wardrobe. Kevin hides under the covers as the knight rides off into a forest where once his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks again, the room is back to normal and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw. The next night he prepares a satchel with supplies and a [[Polaroid camera]] but is surprised when six [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] spill out of the wardrobe. Kevin quickly learns the group has stolen a map and is looking for an exit from his room before they are discovered. They find that the bedroom wall leads to a portal. Kevin is hesitant to join until the apparition of a floating, menacing head\u2014the Supreme Being\u2014appears behind them, demanding the return of the map. Kevin and the dwarfs fall into an empty void at the end of the hallway.\n\nThey land in Italy during the [[Battle of Castiglione]]. As they recover, Kevin learns that Randall is the lead dwarf of the group, which also includes Fidgit, Strutter, Og, Wally and Vermin. They were once employed by the Supreme Being to repair holes in the [[spacetime]] fabric, but realised the potential to use the map that identifies these holes to steal riches and escape via time/space travel. With Kevin's help, they visit several locations in spacetime and meet figures such as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Robin Hood]]. Kevin uses his camera to document their visits. However, they are unaware that their activities are being monitored by Evil, a malevolent being who is able to manipulate reality and is attempting to acquire the map.\n\nKevin becomes separated from the group and ends up in [[Mycenaean Greece]], meeting King [[Agamemnon]]. After Kevin inadvertently helps Agamemnon kill a [[Minotaur]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry Gilliam Says Sean Connery Was Originally Written Into 'Time Bandits' as a Joke, Yet \"Saved My Ass\" on Fantasy Film|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/terry-gilliam-says-sean-connery-was-originally-written-into-time-bandits-as-a-joke-yet-saved-my-ass-on-fantasy-film-4086680/|website=hollywoodreporter.com|date=2 November 2020 |publisher=The Hollywood reporter|access-date=11 May 2022}}</ref> the king adopts him. Randall and the others soon locate Kevin and abduct him, much to his resentment, and escape through another hole, arriving on the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. After it sinks, they tread water while arguing with each other. Evil manipulates the group and transports them to his realm, the Time of Legends. After surviving encounters with ogres and a giant, Kevin and the dwarfs locate the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness and are led to believe that \"The Most Fabulous Object in the World\" awaits them, luring them into Evil's trap. Evil takes the map and locks the group in a cage over a bottomless pit. While looking through the Polaroids he took, Kevin finds one that includes the map, and the group realises there is a hole near them. They escape from the cage and Kevin distracts their pursuers while the others go through the hole.\n\nEvil confronts Kevin and takes the map from him. The dwarfs return with various warriors and fighting machines from across time, but Evil has no trouble overpowering them all. As Kevin and the dwarfs cower, Evil prepares to unleash his ultimate power. Suddenly, he is engulfed in flames and burned into charcoal; from the smoke, a besuited elderly man emerges, revealed as the [[Supreme Being]]. He reveals that he allowed the dwarfs to borrow his map and the whole adventure had been a test. He orders the dwarfs to collect the pieces of concentrated Evil, warning that they can be deadly if not contained. After recovering the map he allows the dwarfs to rejoin him in his creation duties. The Supreme Being disappears with the dwarfs, leaving Kevin behind as a missed piece of Evil begins to smoulder.\n\nKevin awakes in his bedroom to find it filled with smoke. Firefighters break down the door and rescue him as they put out a fire in his house. One of the firemen finds that his parents' new toaster oven caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon and discovers that he still has the photos from his adventure. Kevin's parents discover a smouldering rock in the toaster oven. Recognising it as a piece of Evil, Kevin warns them not to touch it because it is pure evil. They touch it and explode, leaving only their shoes. As the Agamemnon-firefighter winks at the boy before leaving, Kevin approaches the smoking shoes and is seen from above as his figure grows smaller, revealing the planet and then outer space, before being rolled up in the map by the Supreme Being.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Craig Warnock]] as Kevin\n* [[David Rappaport]] as Randall\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as Fidgit\n* [[Malcolm Dixon (actor)|Malcolm Dixon]] as Strutter\n* [[Mike Edmonds]] as Og\n* [[Jack Purvis (actor)|Jack Purvis]] as Wally\n* Tiny Ross as Vermin\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Agamemnon]]/Fireman\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Evil\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as Pansy\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Napoleon]]\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Vincent\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as Supreme Being\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Winston the Ogre\n* [[Katherine Helmond]] as Mrs. Ogre\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[Robin Hood]]\n* [[Derek Deadman]] as Robert\n* [[Jerold Wells]] as Benson\n* [[David Daker]] as Kevin's father\n* [[Sheila Fearn]] as Kevin's mother\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Compere\n* [[Tony Jay]] (''voice'') as the Supreme Being\n* [[Terence Bayler]] as Lucien\n* [[Preston Lockwood]] as Neguy\n* [[Charles McKeown]] as Theatre Manager\n* [[Derrick O'Connor]] as Redgrave\n* [[Neil McCarthy (actor)|Neil McCarthy]] as Marion\n* Ian Muir as the Giant\n* [[Myrtle Devenish]] as Beryl\n* [[John Young (actor)|John Young]] as Reginald\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn November 1979, [[Terry Gilliam]] developed the concept for ''Time Bandits'' after he had started work on ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''. [[Monty Python]] manager and producer [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]] had difficulty understanding the concept of ''Brazil'', so Gilliam decided on the idea of a family film. O'Brien had set up [[HandMade Films]] in London for the former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] to produce ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' and the initiative was to produce more films with Python talent. When Gilliam's pitch was accepted he co-wrote the script with fellow Python [[Michael Palin]].<ref name=\"gizmodo\">{{cite web |last=Sellers |first=Robert |title=It's a miracle that Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits even got made |url=https://gizmodo.com/its-a-miracle-that-terry-gilliams-time-bandits-even-g-1332560707 |website=Gizmodo |language=en-us |date=17 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |title='Terry Gilliam: Career in 40 Minutes' | url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=boxxgJIwbtc&feature=youtu.be\n|date=March 14, 2014 |publisher=Total Film | via=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Sean Connery]] was cast as Agamemnon after meeting producer O'Brien on a golf course. A reference in the script introduced the character with the joke description \"Removing his helmet reveals himself to be none other than Sean Connery or an actor of equal but cheaper stature\". Connery was a Python fan and agreed to do the role for a nominal fee in return for a share of the gross profits.<ref name=\"Gilliam/Palin 1\">{{cite AV media |title='Gilliam/Palin Interview on Time Bandits, Part 1 of 3' | url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x5LHk-OrcWo&feature=youtu.be |date=March 16, 2008 |publisher=Oddmartian2 | via=[[YouTube]] }}</ref><ref name=\"gizmodo\"/>\n\nThe part of Robin Hood was originally written for Palin but [[John Cleese]] was eventually cast as his name was considered more bankable.

Cleese based his performance on the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] by watching him having meaningless conversations with footballers at the [[FA Cup Final]] during the team line-up before the match. Cleese remarked, \"It always struck me as the most extraordinary ritual, the complete futility of that walking up and down thing.\"<ref name=\"gizmodo\"/>\n\n[[Ralph Richardson]]'s casting as the Supreme Being was because he was regarded \"pretty much near God in the acting profession\".<ref name=\"Gilliam/Palin 2\">{{cite AV media |title='Gilliam/Palin Interview on Time Bandits, Part 2 of 3' | url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3ofj3XeywjM&feature=youtu.be\n|date=March 16, 2008 |publisher=Oddmartian2 | via=[[YouTube]] }}</ref> Richardson took his role seriously, marking out his lines in red ink and occasionally saying, \"God wouldn't say that.\"<ref name=\"gizmodo\"/>\n\n[[Ruth Gordon]] and [[Gilda Radner]] were considered for the role of Mrs. Ogre.
