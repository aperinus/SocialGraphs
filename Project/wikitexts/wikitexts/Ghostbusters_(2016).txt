The story focuses on four eccentric women (and their incompetent assistant) who are interested in [[parapsychology]] and start a [[Ghost hunting|ghost-catching]] business in [[New York City]].\n\nA third ''Ghostbusters'' film had been in various stages of development following the release of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989. Because of original cast member [[Bill Murray]]'s refusal to commit to the project, and the death of fellow cast member [[Harold Ramis]] in 2014, Sony decided to reboot the series instead. Many of the original film's cast members and their family members make [[cameo appearance]]s in new roles, and Ramis is commemorated in the film's [[closing credits]].

Erin later disowned the work, while Abby continues her research at an inadequate research college, the Kenneth P. Higgins Institute of Science in New York City, with engineering physicist Jillian Holtzmann as her partner. Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], is in line for [[academic tenure|tenure]] when she discovers that Abby republished their book. Erin convinces her to cease its publication after helping Abby and Jillian at an alleged [[haunted house]]. They encounter a malevolent ghost before she escapes, restoring Erin's belief in the supernatural and friendship with Abby. Erin loses her bid for tenure at Columbia after their [[vlog]] becomes [[Viral video|viral]]. She offers to join Abby and Jillian, but the dean of the Higgins Institute fires them as well. After stealing equipment, they establish temporary headquarters above a Chinese restaurant. They verbosely name themselves \"Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination\", build technology to track ghosts and hire [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]] Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].\n\n[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA) staffer Patty Tolan encounters a ghost in a [[Metro station|subway terminal]] built under a haunted [[Auburn Correctional Facility|prison in Auburn]] and contacts the team. They find the ghost and test Jillian's prototype for the [[proton pack]]s on the entity but fail to capture him. They advertise their services with a \"no ghosts allowed\" logo that Jillian made based on a [[graffiti]] artist's defacement, and the name pundits have labeled them\u2014\"Ghostbusters\". Patty joins the team, providing extensive knowledge of New York City, [[Railway track|rail]] [[personal protective equipment]], and a repurposed [[hearse]] from her mortician uncle Bill Jenkins, named \"[[Ecto-1]]\".\n\nThe supernatural events have been triggered by [[mad scientist]] Rowan North, an [[occult]]ist with a [[god complex]] who attracts ghosts over [[Manhattan]] with self-developed [[air ioniser|ionizer]]s that correspond to the Ghostbusters' technology, allowing him to experiment and create a dimensional vortex powered by [[Ionization|turned]] psi energy. When Rowan plants another device at a concert, the Ghostbusters are called and capture a [[Gargoyle (monster)|gargoyle]]-like spirit there, becoming city sensations but antagonizing Rowan. While [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the quartet, Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws him out of a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that they and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of the city's supernatural activities. While privately acknowledging the team's work, they publicly denounce them as fraudsters.\n\nThe Ghostbusters realize Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, with their alignments intersecting at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site of violent occurrences. They find that Rowan's vortex will breach a ghostly dimension at the intersection, potentially triggering an apocalypse. During a confrontation, Rowan electrocutes himself with his main machine, after which Jillian deactivates it. Jillian finds an annotated copy of ''Ghosts from Our Past'' in Rowan's underground laboratory, explaining the similarity between their technologies. Erin later discovers that Rowan planned to commit suicide so he could become a ghost himself. Rowan returns as a deity-like ghost and attempts to kill the Ghostbusters at their headquarters by possessing Abby, but Patty stops him. He then possesses Kevin and escapes to the hotel, opening the portal and releasing galvanized ghosts. The authorities are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through Rowan's spectral army to reach the portal.\n\nAfter leaving Kevin, Rowan appears as the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to a [[kaiju]]-like size, and goes on a rampage. The team turns Ecto-1's [[Nuclear reactor|reactor]] as a [[Improvised explosive device|makeshift]] bomb, detonating a nuclear explosion inside the vortex. This reverses the portal and forces Rowan and the ghosts back in, restoring the city. Rowan tries to drag Abby with him in retaliation, but Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her.\n\nDespite the city's fascination with the supernatural and lauding the Ghostbusters as heroes, the mayor's office continues to denounce them publicly but covertly funds their operations. With new resources, the Ghostbusters move to a disused firehouse, where they build more equipment, including an ecto-containment system. While investigating [[electronic voice phenomenon]] (EVP), Patty hears the word \"[[List of Ghostbusters characters#Terror Dogs: Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho the Keymaster|Zuul]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n{{Original research|section|date=June 2021}}\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Dr. Abigail L. \"Abby\" Yates\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Dr. Erin Gilbert\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Dr. Jillian \"Holtz\" Holtzmann\n* [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]] as Patricia \"Patty\" Tolan\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Kevin Beckman\n* [[Neil Casey]] as Dr. Rowan North\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Mayor Bradley\n* [[Cecily Strong]] as Jennifer Lynch\n* [[Michael K.
