It is a [[parody]] of many popular thriller and [[horror film]]s, notably ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Along with Greggio, it features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Billy Zane]], [[Joanna Pacu\u0142a]], [[Charlene Tilton]] and [[Martin Balsam]].\n\nLike many of its contemporary satires (including ''[[The Naked Gun]]''), it is largely driven by wordplay, sight gags, running jokes,<ref name=\"empire\"/> and references to popular culture of the time (such as ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]'') and tongue-in-cheek references to then-current American politics (such as a fight scene between Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]). [[Mel Brooks]], who made a number of well regarded parodies (''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]''), makes a cameo appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows rookie [[detective]] Jo Dee Fostar ([[Billy Zane]]) on his first case: apprehending a [[serial killer]] wanted for over 120 murders. To find the killer, Fostar enlists the help of convicted murderer Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza (Deluise). During the investigation, Fostar's girlfriend, Jane Wine ([[Charlene Tilton]]) is asked by her boss to take a large sum of money to the bank; instead, she leaves town with the money. She decides to hide out at the Cemetery Motel, which is revealed to be a [[cemetery]] named Motel after its owner, Antonio Motel (Greggio). Jo must then enlist the help of Det. Balsam (Balsam) and Dr. Pizza to find not only the murderer, but his missing girlfriend. This takes the cast on many adventures at the Cemetery Motel. In the final confrontation, most of the characters are revealed to be other people in disguise.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ezio Greggio]] as Antonio Motel\n*[[Dom DeLuise]] as Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza\n*[[Billy Zane]] as Jo Dee Fostar\n*[[Joanna Pacu\u0142a]] as Lily Wine\n*[[Charlene Tilton]] as Jane Wine\n*[[Martin Balsam]] as Det.
