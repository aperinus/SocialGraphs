The masked man enters the lab, carrying the severed head, and fights the thief, who escapes in horror. The man unmasks himself and is revealed to be Baron [[Victor Frankenstein]]. The thief goes to the police station to report the severed head to Inspector Frisch. Frankenstein, under the alias Mr. Fenner, rents a room at a boarding house run by landlady Anna Spengler. Anna's fianc\u00e9 Karl Holst is a doctor at the asylum where Frankenstein's former assistant Dr. Frederick Brandt was committed after going insane.\n\nAfter discovering Karl has been stealing narcotics in order to support Anna's ailing mother, Frankenstein reveals his true identity and blackmails Karl into helping him kidnap Brandt so he can get the secret formula of his experiment. While stealing equipment from a warehouse for Frankenstein's new lab, Karl and the Baron are caught by the guard. Karl panics and stabs him. Frankenstein, now with a further hold on Karl uses him and Anna to kidnap Brandt. They take him back to the house where they build a lab in the basement. Karl confides to Anna about killing the guard and begs her to leave, fearing she may go to prison for being an accessory to a murderer, but she refuses.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandt has a heart attack, prompting Frankenstein and Karl to kidnap the asylum's administrator Professor Richter to transplant Brandt's brain into his body. That night, while Anna is getting ready for bed, Frankenstein enters her room and rapes her. The next day, Frankenstein and Karl succeed in transplanting Brandt's brain into Richter's body and bury Brandt's body in the garden. Brandt's wife Ella recognises Frankenstein in the street and confronts him about her husband's kidnapping. Frankenstein assures her he has cured her husband's mental illness, but does not let her see him. She refuses to believe him and goes to Frisch.\n\nWhile the creature recovers, Frankenstein and the lovers relocate to a deserted manor house when the police begin to close in. In the lab, the creature awakes and is horrified by his appearance. He scares Anna, who stabs him, causing him to escape. Frankenstein returns and finds the creature gone. In a rage, he fatally stabs Anna and goes after the creature. The creature makes it to his former home, but his wife refuses to accept him as her husband. Wanting revenge on Frankenstein and knowing the Baron will eventually track him there, he allows his wife to go free and pours liquid paraffin around the house.\n\nFrankenstein soon arrives, with Karl following. Inside the house, the creature makes fires to trap him. Frankenstein finds the papers of discovery and flees, but is ambushed by Karl, and they fight. The creature emerges, knocks Karl out and carries a screaming Frankenstein into the burning house, where they both presumably die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as Baron Victor Frankenstein\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as Professor Richter/The Creature\n* [[Simon Ward]] as Dr. Karl Holst \n* [[Veronica Carlson]] as Anna Spengler\n* [[George Pravda]] as Dr. Frederick Brandt\n* [[Maxine Audley]] as Ella Brandt\n* [[Thorley Walters]] as Inspector Frisch\n* [[Windsor Davies]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Allan Surtees]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as Police Doctor\n* [[Colette O'Neil]] as Madwoman\n* [[Frank Middlemass]] as Guest - Plumber\n* [[Norman Shelley]] as Guest - Smoking pipe\n* [[Michael Gover]] as Guest - Reading newspaper\n* George Belbin as Guest - Playing chess\n* [[Peter Copley]] as Principal\n* Jim Collier as Dr. Heidecke\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe scene where Frankenstein rapes Anna was filmed over the objections of both Peter Cushing and Veronica Carlson, and director [[Terence Fisher]], who halted it when he felt enough was enough.<ref name=\"hallenbeck\">{{cite book|last=Hallenbeck|first=Bruce G.|title=The Hammer Frankenstein: British Cult Cinema|publisher=Midnight Marquee Press|location=Parkville, Maryland|year=2013|pages=167, 170|ISBN=978-1936168330}}</ref> It was not in the original script, but the scene was added at the insistence of Hammer executive [[James Carreras]], who was under pressure to keep the American distributors happy.<ref name=\"hallenbeck\"/>\n\nThe scenes featuring Thorley Walters as Inspector Frisch were also late additions to the original script; they have been described as unnecessary, adding an unwelcome element of comedy into the suspenseful story and also making the film too long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aon.at/frankenstein/frankenstein-hammer5.htm |title=Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed - Terence Fisher, Peter Cushing, Hammer Studios 1969 |publisher=Members.aon.at |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75595/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed/trivia.html |title=Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) - Trivia |publisher=TCM.com |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed_1969 |title=Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed 1969 &#124; Britmovie &#124; Home of British Films |website=Britmovie |access-date=2014-04-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141751/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed_1969 |archive-date=13 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Welsh version==\nIn 1978, the Welsh television station [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] Cymru/Wales broadcast a version dubbed into the [[Welsh language]] called ''Rhaid Dinistrio Frankenstein'', a more-or-less literal translation of the English title.
