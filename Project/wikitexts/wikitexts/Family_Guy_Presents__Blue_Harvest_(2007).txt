It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 23, 2007. The episode is a retelling and [[parody]] of the 1977 blockbuster film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', recasting the show's characters as ''Star Wars'' characters, created with permission from [[Lucasfilm]] on the condition that the characters had to look exactly like they do in the movies. The plot follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] as he retells the story of ''Star Wars'' while the electricity is out in their house.\n\nThe title is a reference to the working title of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. The episode was written by [[Alec Sulkin]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], and guest-stars [[Chevy Chase]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Mick Hucknall]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and [[Judd Nelson]]. The episode also includes recurring voice actors [[Lori Alan]], [[Adam West]], [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[John Viener]], [[Steve Callaghan]], [[Kirker Butler]], [[Mark Hentemann]], [[Johnny Brennan]], [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]], [[Phil LaMarr]], and [[Wally Wingert]]. It was viewed by 10.86 million viewers on its original broadcast and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe power goes out while the [[Griffin family|Griffins]] are watching television, and they are left with no other form of entertainment. While they wait for the power to return, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to retell the story of ''Star Wars'' beginning with \"Part IV\".\n\nA [[Tantive IV|Rebel ship]] is captured by a [[Star Destroyer]]. On the ship are the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]]s [[C-3PO]] ([[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]), [[R2-D2]] ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]) and the rebel leader [[Princess Leia]] ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]). While the ship is boarded by [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]]s, Leia tries to send an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is captured by [[Darth Vader]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) while R2 and 3PO flee to [[Tatooine]] in an escape pod, where they are captured by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawa]]s (one of whom is [[Mort Goldman|Mort]]).\n\nThe droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers, whose nephew [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) wishes to join the [[Rebel Alliance|Rebellion]] and fight the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him, but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them ([[List of Family Guy characters#Pawtucket Brewery|Opie]]) and is found by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the [[Death Star]], which must be sent to her father on her home planet of [[Alderaan]] and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of [[the Force]] and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own [[lightsaber]]. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed, along with [[John Williams]].\n\nLuke, Obi-Wan, and the droids travel to [[Mos Eisley]] to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan. At a local cantina, they hire smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Peter Griffin|Peter]]) and his [[Wookiee]] co-pilot [[Chewbacca]] ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]), who agree to take them with their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Adam West (Family Guy)|Adam West]]) has Alderaan destroyed. The ''Millennium Falcon'' exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four of them dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the ''Falcon'', taking the couch with them.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' journeys to the Rebel base at [[Yavin IV]], where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters (who also include [[Simply Red]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Redd Foxx]], [[Red Buttons]], the ''[[Red October (submarine)|Red October]]'' and an anthropomorphic pack of [[Big Red (gum)|Big Red]] gum) attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, and is about to fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the ''Falcon'' and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.\n\nBack at the Griffins' home, Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on. Everyone thanks Peter for keeping them entertained, although Chris points out that ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' already told [[Robot Chicken: Star Wars|that story]]. Peter dismisses and mocks the show, and Chris storms off.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=A man with black hair, and tan skin with a black shirt on, leans forward while laughing into a microphone.|''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] served as executive producer for the episode.]]\n\"Blue Harvest\" originally aired on September 23, 2007, as the premiere for the [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''Family Guy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew;_ylt=ApqUwltmQ..ERF8wJh8qBou9v9EF|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|title=Family Guy: Petarded|access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=yah/> The episode was written by [[Alec Sulkin]], who has been with the show since the fourth season.<ref name=yah/> It was directed by series veteran [[Dominic Polcino]], who has been directing for the series since its first season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/i-never-met-the-dead-man/episode/1545|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|title=Family Guy: Chitty Chitty Death Bang|access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and James Purdum served as supervising directors.<ref name=yah/> The episode's music was composed by Walter Murphy.<ref name=yah>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/blue-harvest-part-2/episode/146691;_ylt=AgVs4bzNT7h1XQOYwR33KJOvo9EF|title=Family Guy: Blue Harvest, Part 1|publisher=Yahoo!|access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] explained that the reason they made a parody of ''Star Wars'' in particular was because the show's staff members were huge fans of the films.<ref name=la/> They also chose ''Star Wars'' because [[Lucasfilm]] allowed it.<ref name=la/> MacFarlane stated that creating parodies based on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' or ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' was originally considered, but they assumed they would be unable to gain permission from the owners of those properties (in this case [[Paramount Pictures]]).<ref name=la/> Lucasfilm gave only one condition: that the characters had to look exactly like they do in the movies.<ref name=la>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/27/entertainment/la-ca-conversation27-2009dec27|title=Q & A with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Collins, Scott|date=December 27, 2009|access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nClips of the episode were shown to audience members at [[Star Wars Celebration|''Star Wars'' Celebration]] IV, where a panel was hosted by MacFarlane, Sulkin and Polcino, and executive producer [[David A.
