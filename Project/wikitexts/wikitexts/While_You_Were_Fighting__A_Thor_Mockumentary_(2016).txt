Initially released from 2016 to 2018, they were included as special features in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the MCU films]]' [[Blu-ray]] and [[digital distribution]] releases and are the sixth through eighth [[Marvel One-Shot]] short films. The series consists of ''Team Thor'', ''Team Thor: Part 2'', and ''Team Darryl'', all written and directed by [[Taika Waititi]].\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] in the first two films, in which he moves in with a new roommate, Darryl Jacobson (Daley Pearson), during the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016). [[Mark Ruffalo]] also appears in the first film as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], while [[Jeff Goldblum]] appears in the third as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]], whom Darryl lives with after moving to Los Angeles. Filming for ''Team Thor'' occurred one month before the start of filming on ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017) and was done to introduce MCU fans to the irreverent tone of ''Ragnarok''.\n\nThe shorts were praised for their humor and Hemsworth's performance. They were made available on [[Disney+]] in January 2022, at which point Marvel classified them as One-Shots.\n\n== Development ==\n''Team Thor'' was filmed one month before ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017) began filming in July 2016.<ref name=\"WaititiInterview\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokFilming\" /> It is a [[mockumentary]], similar to director [[Taika Waititi]]'s film ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> Before ''Team Thor'' was released, many fans were unsure of Waititi's new tonal approach for ''Ragnarok''. Waititi felt ''Team Thor'' \"helped us a lot\" by giving fans the opportunity to see \"just how irreverent we were gonna be, and just how different we were making [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|[Bruce] Banner]] as well\".<ref name=\"WaititiInterview\" /> In September 2016, Waititi said Darryl Jacobson would probably be seen again, adding that there may be \"other little pieces of [''Team Thor''] that may just be a small part of a bigger thing\".<ref name=\"WaititiIGN\" />\n\nIn October 2017, [[Marvel Studios]] President [[Kevin Feige]] stated that he saw the shorts as a \"doable\" version of their previous [[Marvel One-Shots]] shorts series, and felt that they \"in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in ''Ragnarok'' in a fun way.\"<ref name=\"FandangoOct2017\" /> As well, [[Jeff Goldblum]], who portrays the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]] in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', stated he had shot footage with Waititi for another short,<ref name=\"GoldblumOct2017\" /> which became ''Team Darryl''.<ref name=\"RagnarokHomeMedia\" /> The three shorts were made available on [[Disney+]] in January 2022,<ref name=\"D+Release\" /> at which point Marvel classified them as One-Shots.<ref name=\"TeamThorOneShots\" /><ref name=\"TeamThorOneShotsD+Tweet\" />\n\n== Films ==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 99%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Director & Screenwriter\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Producer\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Home media release\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Digital\n! scope=\"col\" | Physical\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[<includeonly>Team Thor</includeonly>#Team Thor (2016)|Team Thor]]''\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | {{Start date|2016|8|28}}\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | {{Start date|2016|9|13}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Taika Waititi]]<ref name=\"HemsworthTVSeries\">{{Cite web |last=Carbone |first=Gina |date=April 12, 2019 |title=Yes!

As he does this, he is interviewed by a film crew and talks about his daily life in Australia. Thor is seen visiting a kindergarten classroom, attempting to send emails with Darryl's help to [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] concerning their conflict,{{efn|As seen in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" />}} and revealing his investigative board concerning the connections between the [[Infinity Stones]], the Avengers, [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]], and [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]. Later, Thor meets Bruce Banner at a cafe regarding not being contacted by Stark and Rogers. Banner receives a phone call from Stark, who does not appear to want to reach out or talk to Thor. As such, Thor decides to start his own team, Team Thor, with him and Darryl.\n\n''Team Thor'' was first screened at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]],<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> before being released online on August 28, 2016.<ref name=\"TeamThorAugRelease\" /> It was also released on the home media of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) in September 2016.<ref name=\"TeamThorAugRelease\" /><ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> The film is also known as ''While You Were Fighting: A Thor Mockumentary''.<ref name=\"TeamThorIndieWire\" /> The mockumentary was said to have been produced by the \"New Zealand Film Board\",<ref name=\"ColliderSDCC2016\" /> and its title card features a grainy, VHS-style logo of ''Captain America: Civil War'' with \"Team Thor\" \"crudely put over it\".<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> [[Chris Hemsworth]] and [[Mark Ruffalo]] reprise their [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) roles as Thor and Bruce Banner, respectively,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> with Daley Pearson appearing as Thor's Australian flatmate Darryl Jacobson.<ref name=\"TeamThor2\" /> The film was referred to as ''Team Thor: Part 1'' with its release on [[Disney+]] in January 2022.<ref name=\"TeamThorOneShotsD+Tweet\" />\n\n=== ''Team Thor: Part 2'' (2017) ===\nContinuing from the first mockumentary, Thor and his roommate Darryl discuss their domestic responsibilities at their apartment, with Darryl being stuck with most of the cleaning. Darryl then proceeds to state how Thor is a nice person but out of touch with time, and becomes frustrated with Thor's attempts to pay rent with [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgardian]] currency. He suggests Thor look for a job, which Thor laughs at and counters by suggesting they get a servant. Additional footage from Thor's visit to the kindergarten classroom is shown. The interview ends with Thor feeling he does not need anyone else in his life besides Darryl, and suggests that Darryl get a superhero outfit.\n\n''Team Thor: Part 2'' was released on the home media of ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016) in February 2017,<ref name=\"TeamThor2\" /><ref name=\"DSHomeMedia\" /> with Hemsworth and Pearson both returning.<ref name=\"TeamThor2THR\" /> The film is also known as ''Team Thor: Part 2, Where Are They Now?''<ref name=\"SyfyWirePart2\" /><ref name=\"TeamThor2THR\" />\n\n=== ''Team Darryl'' (2018) ===\nAfter Thor moved out of Darryl's apartment, Darryl moves to Los Angeles and becomes roommates with the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]], the only person who responded to his ads. The Grandmaster believes Darryl would be a good replacement assistant and various clips are shown of Darryl performing menial tasks for the Grandmaster, such as taking out the trash and driving him around. Darryl goes on to describe how the Grandmaster seems like a good person but has issues understanding Darryl's personal space and has his own anger issues. The Grandmaster states he has grown accustomed to Earth and plans to take it over, with Darryl standing at his side. He creates a video explaining his plan and posts it to the internet. However, after receiving no views, he plans to advertise the first video by posting a second video with a musical guest. He hires Darryl's friends to help him but melts one of them when his expectations are not met. Darryl confesses he is unsure if the Grandmaster also wants to melt him, and admits he misses Thor as his roommate.\n\n''Team Darryl'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] for ''Thor: Ragnarok'' on February 20, 2018, and on [[Blu-ray]] on March 6. Pearson reprises his role as Darryl and is joined by Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster.<ref name=\"RagnarokHomeMedia\" /> It is set after the events of ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and is a continuation from the film's [[post-credits scene]].<ref name=\"InverseTeamDarryl\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 10%\"; | Character\n! colspan=\"3\" | Films\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 7%;\" | ''Team Thor''<br />(2016)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 7%;\" | ''Team Thor: Part 2''<br />(2017)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 7%;\" | ''Team Darryl''<br />(2018)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]\n| [[Mark Ruffalo]]<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" />\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cEmpty}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cEmpty}}\n| [[Jeff Goldblum]]<ref name=\"RagnarokHomeMedia\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Darryl Jacobson\n| colspan=\"3\" | Daley Pearson<ref name=\"TeamThor2\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokHomeMedia\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | [[Chris Hemsworth]]<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"TeamThor2THR\" />\n| {{cEmpty}}\n|}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Chris Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|The comedic performance of Chris Hemsworth in the shorts was widely praised]]\nDespite being \"a silly little short\", Ethan Anderton of ''[[/Film]]'' found ''Team Thor'' to be hilarious,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> as did Germain Lussier at ''[[io9]]'', who felt ''Ragnarok'' would be amazing if it had \"an iota of this humor\".<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> Anderton later added that similar short films like ''Team Thor'' would be a great replacement for the Marvel One-Shots.<ref name=\"/FilmAug2016\" /> ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]''{{'}}s Tommy Cook and Adam Chitwood also enjoyed the short, with Cook feeling it \"perfectly captured Waititi's irreverent sense of humor\" and praised Hemsworth's comedic abilities,<ref name=\"ColliderSDCC2016\" /> while Chitwood said there were \"a number of really funny touches\" and noted Hemsworth and Waititi were a good comedic fit.<ref name=\"ColliderAug2016\" /> Ross A. Lincoln of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' enjoyed the film and Hemsworth's comedy as well, calling it one of the biggest highlights from Marvel's Comic-Con panel and hoping that it served as a good indication for how ''Ragnarok'' would turn out.<ref name=\"DeadlineAug2016\" /> Don Kaye at ''[[Syfy Wire]]'' called ''Team Thor'' \"one of the best movies Marvel has ever made\".<ref name=\"SyfyWireKaye\" />\n\nIn anticipation of ''Part 2'' releasing, Nathalie Caron from ''Syfy Wire'' noted by its teaser that it was \"using the same brand of humor that made the first... such a massive hit with fans everywhere\".<ref name=\"SyfyWirePart2\" /> Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Aaron Couch called ''Part 2'' \"the sequel no one could accuse of suffering from sequelitis\".<ref name=\"TeamThor2THR\" /> Alexandra August at ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' called ''Team Darryl'' \"just as hilarious as the ''Team Thor'' installments before it, if a little (way) more disturbing\".<ref name=\"TeamDarrylCBR\" />\n\n== Related content and future ==\nIn August 2018, Daley Pearson released a video reprising his role as Darryl to state he survived [[the Blip]], as seen in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and is forced to work weekends since many of his co-workers did not survive. He also wishes Thor a happy birthday and asks him if he can transfer any money, as Darryl is now in debt.<ref name=\"DarrylSnap\" /> In April 2019, Hemsworth expressed interest in doing more ''Team Thor'' short films, with the possibility of doing a television series.<ref name=\"HemsworthTVSeries\" /> Pearson appears as Darryl in ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022) as a New Asgard tour
