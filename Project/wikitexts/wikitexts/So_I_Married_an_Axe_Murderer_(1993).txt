Myers plays Charlie MacKenzie, a man afraid of commitment until he meets Harriet (Travis), who works at a butcher shop and may be a serial killer. Myers also plays his own character's father, Stuart. The film received a mixed reception from critics and did not fare well at the [[box office]], grossing over $11 million, but it has gained a cult following in the years since its release.\n\nA miniseries called ''[[The Pentaverate]]'', created by Myers and based on the in-universe conspiracy theories mentioned in this film, was released in May 2022 on [[Netflix]].\n\n== Plot ==\nCharlie MacKenzie is a popular local [[beat poet]] living in [[San Francisco]] who makes his frequent break-ups the subject of his poems. His best friend Tony, a recently promoted police detective, seems to believe that Charlie simply is afraid of commitment and will identify (or invent) any reason to break up with someone.\n\nWhile purchasing dinner for his [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born parents, Stuart and May, he encounters a butcher named Harriet, and finds himself attracted to her. During his visit to his family, Charlie and May discuss his recent break up with another one of his girlfriends, during which May brings up an article in the tabloid that describes a character known as \"Mrs. X\", a bride who kills her husbands on their honeymoons using an axe.\n\nLater on, Charlie goes back to the butcher shop where Harriet works and offers to help her, during which the two quickly find common bonds between them. They start to date, and after staying at her place one night, Charlie meets Harriet's eccentric sister, Rose, who warns Charlie to be careful. During their time together, he learns she used to live in [[Atlantic City]], had been involved with a trainer in Russian martial arts, and screams for someone named Ralph in her sleep. As they continue to see each other, Charlie and Harriet fall in love. He arranges a dinner with her to meet his parents, who point out that she's their favourite of all of his previous partners. Whilst there, Charlie spots the article about Mrs. X and becomes panicked, as he realise that not only was one of the victims a martial arts expert, but another also happened to be named Ralph.\n\nCharlie becomes paranoid and asks Tony to investigate Harriet and the Mrs. X story. Tony reveals that the husbands of Mrs. X were all reported missing alongside their wives, assuring that Harriet is unlikely to be Mrs. X. Charlie remains on edge, and after a few more troubled dates, decides to break up with her. Tony later reports that a killer in the Mrs. X story has confessed. Relieved, Charlie apologizes to Harriet by reciting one of his beat poems to her from his rooftop. They make up, and Harriet explains away some of the confusion Charlie had from her history, such as Ralph being the name of a woman she knows.\n\nSome time later, at his parents' wedding anniversary Charlie proposes to Harriet, which she reluctantly accepts after some hesitation. Following the wedding ceremony, they embark on a honeymoon to a secluded mountain hotel. After they depart, Tony learns that the confessed killer is actually a [[compulsive liar]]. He sends a photo of Harriet to the known associates of the missing husbands, and all report back that she was their friends' wife. With phone lines to the hotel down due to a storm, Tony charters a plane. Once he lands, he is able to call Charlie locally and warn him that Harriet really is Mrs. X, but the hotel phone line is knocked out and power is lost.\n\nCharlie is panicked and tries to stay away from Harriet without letting her know what he knows, but the hotel staff force him into the honeymoon suite for their first night together. After locking Harriet in the closet, Charlie discovers a letter, purportedly written by him, explaining his absence to Harriet. Suddenly, Rose appears wielding an axe. Rose tells Charlie he was not supposed to find the letter, and reveals herself as the Mrs. X killer, and that she feels that Harriet's husbands are taking her sister from her, motivating her to kill them on their honeymoon night and leave letters behind claiming to be from them, leading Harriet to believe that each husband simply left her. Charlie is then trapped in a game of cat-and-mouse, staying away from Rose while waiting for the police to arrive.\n\nTony leads the police into the hotel but arrests Harriet, still believing her to be the murderer. Charlie, having been chased to the hotel roof pursued by Rose, is able to get Tony\u2019s attention as they prepare to take Harriet away, prompting Tony to run up the stairs to the roof to intervene. Whilst the police make their way up there Rose swings the axe at Charlie and is thrown off the building, with only Charlie holding her up from falling to her death. Tony comes to catch her fall, where she is arrested and taken away. Charlie and Harriet resume their lives afterward as a happy couple.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Charlie MacKenzie / Stuart MacKenzie\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Harriet Michaels\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Tony Giardino\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Rose Michaels\n* [[Michael Richards]] as Insensitive Man\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as May MacKenzie\n* [[Matt Doherty (actor)|Matt Doherty]] as William \"Heed\" MacKenzie\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Commandeered Driver\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as John \"Vickie\" Johnson, Alcatraz Guide\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Susan, Tony's Girlfriend\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Pilot\n* [[Jessie Nelson (filmmaker)|Jessie Nelson]] as Ralph\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Tony's Captain \n* [[Greg Germann]] as Concierge\n* [[Kelvin Han Yee]] as Master Cho\n* [[Patrick Bristow]] as Cafe Roads Performer\n* [[Luenell]] as Police Records Officer\n* [[Steve Dunleavy]] as Himself\n* [[Mike Hagerty]] as Obituary Writer\n* [[Paul Sanchez]] as Serenade Musician\n* [[Glen Vernon]] as Uncle Angus\n* [[Robert Nichols (actor)|Robert Nichols]] as Scottish Minister\n* [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as Sherry\n* [[Marla Sokoloff]] as Alcatraz Visitor\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe genesis of the film originated in 1987, when producer [[Robert N.

Fox was asked to consider a new set of credits that gave him a \"story by\" and co-screenplay credit. He rejected the proposal and in arbitration, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided that Fox would receive sole screenwriting credit.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/> Fried and Myers were upset that Mullarkey, who had put much work into the script, did not receive any credit.<ref name=\"Portman\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nFriend and co-producer Cary Woods asked Mike Myers to play Charlie MacKenzie because of the success he had with the film ''Wayne's World''.<ref name=\"Portman\"/> He agreed because he liked the script, as many of his friends also had a fear of commitment, and \"were all suffering from cold feet and what is cold feet but a low-grade terror?

[[Chevy Chase]], [[Albert Brooks]], and [[Martin Short]] also considered the role but did not like the character.<ref name=\"Portman\"/> [[Sharon Stone]] was initially set to play Harriet Michaels, the supposed axe murderer of the film's title.\n\nLike Myers, who has two roles in the film, Stone wanted to play Harriet and the role of Rose, Harriet's sister, the latter portrayed in the film by Amanda Plummer. Studio executives at Sony did not like the idea of Stone playing both roles, and she therefore refused to accept the part. Nancy Travis, Fried's partner and future wife, was then cast to replace her.<ref name=dv/> Travis was drawn to her character's \"qualities of danger and compassion mixed with humor [which] make her an intriguing character.\"<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\nAnthony LaPaglia said that his character \"has grand illusions of being ''[[Serpico]]'', you know he's ready to fight crime like his hero did. But he's just not competent.\"<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> When the actors attended the first cast read-through of the script, Charlie's father, Stuart, had not yet been cast. Myers read the character's lines and the filmmakers so enjoyed his interpretation that they realized he could play that role as well.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> The film also features cameos by [[Charles Grodin]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Michael Richards]], [[Mike Hagerty]], [[Debi Mazar]], [[Steven Wright]], and [[Alan Arkin]], the latter appearing uncredited as Tony's sensitive boss. They all agreed to be in the film for the opportunity of working with Myers.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nTo fit both Charlie and his father in the same scene together, the filmmakers used a [[split screen (filmmaking)|split-screen]] process. To look the role of Stuart, Myers spent over three-and-a-half hours having special prosthetic make-up applied.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> While filming scenes in the butcher shop, Nancy Travis was distracted by Myers' antics and accidentally took off the tip of her middle finger on her left hand while chopping vegetables with a kitchen knife.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/> A local doctor sewed her finger back together. Travis said that she and Myers frequently improvised together, and he taught her more about comedy and showed her \"how to be relaxed and spontaneous on the set.\"<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nThere were stories in the press that Myers' over-inflated ego forced extensive re-shoots on the film, and that he tried to deny Robbie Fox credit for writing the film.<ref name=\"Portman\"/> On the set, director [[Thomas Schlamme]] said that he had his differences with Myers over how the film should be shaped. He said that Myers was \"taking a stretch beyond his usual self and was playing outside himself. Personality clashes were bound to happen. We struggled.\"<ref name=\"Stanley\"/> The director denied that Myers was a control freak, and praised the \"total commitment to his work. (But) yes, it was difficult.\"<ref name=\"Stanley\"/> In addition, several major newspapers and magazines claimed that the film went over budget, with in-fighting among the principal actors and lengthy release delays, and that it was unfunny.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/> Despite these early reports, ''So I Married an Axe Murderer'' scored high at test screenings.<ref name=\"Frook\">{{cite news\n | last = Fook\n | first = John Evan\n | title = ''Axe Murderer'' Fete to Benefit Frisco Film Commish\n | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\n | date = July 15, 1993\n | url = https://variety.com/1993/film/news/location-news-axe-murderer-fete-to-benefit-frisco-film-commish-108739/ \n }}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nSet in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], the film features many famous sights and neighborhoods of the Golden State metropolis, including the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] and [[Alcatraz]].

The butcher shop used for \"Meats of the World\" was Prudente Meats on Grant Ave, in the North Beach Section of San Francisco.\n\nThe scene where Charlie breaks up with Harriet was set in [[Alamo Square, San Francisco|Alamo Square]], the background showing the skyline of the city.\n\nThe final scenes are set at [[Dunsmuir House]] in the East Oakland foothills. Additional special effects and [[matte painting]]s created the illusion that the location was secluded among mountains.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> The exterior shot for the caf\u00e9, Cafe Roads, where Myers recites his beat poetry, is the bar Vesuvio, at Columbus Avenue and [[Jack Kerouac]] Alley. The filmmakers picked San Francisco as the film's setting because it was an ideal place for a poet like Charlie to live.\n\nMyers has said that he was attracted to its \"coffeehouse culture, with its clothes and music and its whole sensibility ... people aren't going to bars as much. They tend to go out and have coffee.\"<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> Several sets were built in warehouses near [[Candlestick Park]], and these soundstages were used for many weeks.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\n=== Deleted scenes ===\nAt least two deleted scenes are known to exist.
