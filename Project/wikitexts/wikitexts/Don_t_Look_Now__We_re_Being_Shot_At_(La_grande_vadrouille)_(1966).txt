We're Being Shot At!''''') is a 1966 French-British [[comedy film]] set in 1942 about French civilians who help the crew of a [[Royal Air Force]] bomber shot down over Paris to make their way through [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]] to safe territory.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn a summer day in 1942, a damaged [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] bomber strays over Paris and is shot down by German [[flak]]. After planning to reconvene in the [[Turkish baths]] at the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]], the crew parachutes out, but only three evade capture. Sir Reginald lands in the [[Vincennes Zoo]] and, given civilian clothes by a friendly zookeeper, heads for the baths. Peter Cunningham lands on the platform of a house painter, Augustin Bouvet, from where they escape the Germans and are hidden by a puppet show operator, Juliette; Augustin goes to the baths on Cunningham's behalf. Alan MacIntosh lands on the [[Op\u00e9ra Garnier]], where he is reluctantly assisted by the chief conductor, Stanislas Lefort, who goes to the baths for him. All the while, the [[Wehrmacht|German military]] under Major Achbach furiously pursues the three and their helpers.\n\nFollowing the rendezvous at the bath, Lefort leaves Reginald and Bouvet to arrange their pickup of MacIntosh, but in the meantime Achbach has discovered Lefort's connection with the fugitive aviators and takes him prisoner as he returns to the opera. That evening, Reginald and Bouvet, wearing stolen German uniforms, arrive to fetch MacIntosh, and in the confusion of a bombing attempt against a German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander, the three of them and Lefort are aided in their escape by [[French Resistance|R\u00e9sistance members]] among the opera staff. However, they miss the train that Juliette and Peter are taking to [[Meursault]], from where they can cross the [[Demarcation line (France)|line of demarcation]] to the [[zone libre|French Free Zone]]. Due to a blunder, Peter is discovered, arrested, and brought to German headquarters in Meursault.\n\nAfter getting out of Paris, Reginald, Lefort, Bouvet, and MacIntosh encounter Sister Marie-Odile, a nun whose order is secretly assisting the R\u00e9sistance. Bouvet and Lefort are sent ahead to Meursault to a hotel owned by Juliette's aunt, but there they almost run into Achbach, who has traveled there to interrogate Cunningham. Disguised as a [[Feldgendarmerie]] patrol, they are supposed to make their way across the demarcation line the next morning but are unmasked and brought back to Meursault. Reginald and MacIntosh are meant to be smuggled separately across the line by Marie-Odile, hidden in two wine casks, but due to a miscommunication, their casks are instead diverted into the cellar of the Meursault headquarters.\n\nAfter discovering their friends' presence in the building, the aviators set a fire and use the ensuing mayhem to free them. With Marie-Odile driving a horse wagon, the fugitives make their way to a shuttered [[gliding]] club, where they intend to use the gliders to reach the nearby Free Zone. Closely pursued by Achbach, they manage to take off just in time, and a last-ditch attempt to bring them down with machine-gun fire is accidentally foiled by a [[Esotropia|cross-eyed]] soldier, allowing them to fly to safety.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Bourvil]] as Augustin Bouvet\n* [[Louis de Fun\u00e8s]] as Stanislas Lefort\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Sir Reginald (\"Big Moustache\")\n* [[Claudio Brook]] as Peter Cunningham\n* [[Mike Marshall (actor)|Mike Marshall]] as Alan MacIntosh\n* [[Marie Dubois]] as Juliette\n* [[Pierre Bertin (actor)|Pierre Bertin]] as Juliette's grandfather\n* [[Andr\u00e9a Parisy]] as Sister Marie-Odile\n* [[Mary Marquet]] as The Mother Superior\n* [[Benno Sterzenbach]] as Major Achbach\n* [[Colette Brosset]] as Madame Germaine, hotel manager\n* [[Michel Modo]] as cross-eyed German soldier\n* [[Hans Meyer (actor)|Hans Meyer]] as SS colonel Otto Weber\n* [[Henri G\u00e9n\u00e8s]] as the zoo keeper\n* Jacques Bodoin as [[Mephistopheles|M\u00e9phisto]]\n* [[Guy Grosso]] as a musician\n* Jean Droze as a musician\n* [[Helmuth Schneider]] as German officer on train\n* [[Sieghardt Rupp]] as Leutnant St\u00fcrmer\n* [[Paul Pr\u00e9boist]] as a fisherman\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was made by the same team (Oury, Bourvil and de Fun\u00e8s) who did the enormously successful ''[[The Sucker]]'' (1965).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-story-c22150143&prev=search|title=La Grande Vadrouille |website=Box Office Story}}</ref> It was shot at the [[Billancourt Studios]] in Paris with extensive [[location shooting]] around France.
