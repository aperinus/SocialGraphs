It stars [[Jennifer Lawrence]] and [[Chris Pratt]], with [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Michael Sheen]] and [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] in supporting roles. It follows two passengers on an immense interstellar spacecraft carrying thousands of people to a colony 60 [[Light-year|light years]] from Earth, when the two are awakened 90 years early from their [[Suspended animation|induced hibernation]].\n\nThe script was written in 2007 by Spaihts, but languished in [[development hell]] with multiple actors attached and detached from it over the years until [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] acquired its rights in late 2014. Lawrence, Pratt and Tyldum quickly joined the project, and filming took place from September 2015 to February 2016 in [[Atlanta]]. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/09/20/jennifer-lawrence-and-chris-pratt-get-up-close-and-personal-in-new-passengers-teaser-6139446/ | title=Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt get close in new Passengers trailer | date=September 20, 2016 }}</ref>{{Failed verification | date=August 2022}} It was produced by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], Start Motion Pictures, [[Original Film]], [[LStar Capital]], [[Wanda Media|Wanda Pictures]] and Company Films, and was the last film from [[Columbia Pictures]] with the involvement of Village Roadshow Pictures.\n\n''Passengers'' premiered at the [[Regency Village Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]] on December 14, 2016, and was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures on December 21, 2016, in standard format and [[RealD 3D]]. It received mixed reviews, with praise for Lawrence and Pratt's performances, Newman's musical score, and its visual style and production values, but was criticized for its plot and characters.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 21, 2016 |last=Giles |first=Jeff |title=Sing Is Mostly On Key |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/sing-is-mostly-on-key/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=June 25, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"EW\" /> It grossed $303 million worldwide and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"VarietyOscarNominations\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''Avalon'', a [[sleeper ship]] transporting 5,000 colonists and 258 crew members in [[hibernation]] pods, is traveling from Earth to the planet Homestead II, a 120-year journey. After only 30 years, an asteroid collision damages the ship despite its defense systems, causing a malfunction that awakens mechanical engineer James \"Jim\" Preston 90 years too early.\n\nAfter a year of isolation, with only an [[Android (robot)|android]] barman named Arthur for company, Jim grows despondent and contemplates [[suicide]] until he notices Aurora Lane, a beautiful young woman inside her pod. He views her video interview file, and is smitten. He considers reviving her for companionship, but struggles with the morality of doing so, knowing it will rob her of her intended life on their destination planet. He eventually causes her pod to awaken her, letting her believe she was also the victim of a malfunction. He asks Arthur not to reveal what he has done. Aurora, devastated at having to live out her life on the ship, unsuccessfully tries to re-enter hibernation. Resigned to the situation, Aurora, a writer and journalist, resumes writing about her experience.\n\nThe two slowly grow closer over the next year, and eventually, fall in love. Jim intends to propose to her; but when Arthur hears Jim say there are \"no secrets\" between him and Aurora, the android reveals the truth of her awakening. Aurora berates, shuns, and even physically attacks Jim. She furiously rejects his apologies and avoids contact with him.\n\nSometime later, another pod failure awakens Gus Mancuso, a deck chief officer. Using his personal code to access the bridge (which Jim has repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to force his way into), they discover multiple cascading failures throughout the ship's systems, but the computer doesn't reveal their origin. If the faults are not repaired, the ship will inevitably fail, causing the passengers and crew to perish. While Gus attempts repairs with Jim and Aurora's help, he uncovers the story of Jim awakening Aurora through examining their pods and discusses it with them separately; Gus does not condone Jim's actions but understands, and tells Aurora that a \"drowning man\" (the suicidal Jim) will grab onto any lifeline, even if it were to put their rescuer in danger. Having generally felt unwell since waking, Gus falls critically ill. The ship's automated medical suite, the Autodoc, reveals that Gus has suffered pansystemic necrosis and that he has only hours to live, which Gus realizes was caused by multiple failures of his hibernation pod. Before dying, Gus gives Jim and Aurora his officer's ID, allowing them to access crew-only areas and try to repair the ship.\n\nJim and Aurora find a series of hull breaches from the asteroid's penetration two years earlier. The computer module administering the ship's [[fusion reactor]] power plant has been critically damaged, causing the cascading malfunctions as the other systems' computing power was diverted to try to maintain it. They replace the damaged module, but when the computer attempts to vent the reactor to extinguish a runaway plasma reaction, the exterior vent fails. Jim is forced to spacewalk and vent the plasma from outside, using the manual controls in the vent tube.\n\nJim learns that he must remain in the tube, keeping the vent open, while Aurora initiates venting from inside the ship. Revealing her enduring feelings for him, she admits she is terrified of losing him and being left alone. Jim uses a door as an improvised heat shield and survives the venting but is blasted out into space as his tether snaps, and his damaged spacesuit begins losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves a clinically dead Jim from space and manages to resuscitate him in the Autodoc while the ''Avalon'', its reactor repaired, returns to normal operations.\n\nAfter burying Gus in space, Jim learns that with Gus' clearance the Autodoc can function as a hibernation pod for one person, and offers to put Aurora back in hibernation for the remainder of the voyage. Realizing she would never see him again, she chooses to remain awake with him. He presents her with the makeshift engagement ring he made earlier, which she accepts.\n\nEighty-eight years later, the ship's crew is awakened on schedule, shortly before their arrival at Homestead II. In the ship's grand concourse, they discover a huge tree with trailing vines, lush vegetation, flying birds, and a cabin. A recording of Aurora's story describes the wonderful life she and Jim had together on the ''Avalon''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Aurora Lane, a journalist and writer\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Arthur, an [[Android (robot)|android]] [[bartender]] on the ''Avalon''\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Gus Mancuso, the chief deck officer\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] (in a non-speaking role) as Captain Norris, commanding officer of the ''Avalon''\n* [[Julee Cerda]] and [[Nazanin Boniadi]] as hologram instructors\n* [[Aurora Perrineau]] as Celeste, Aurora's best friend\n\n[[Emma Clarke]], [[Chris Edgerly]], [[Matt Corboy]], [[Fred Melamed]], and screenwriter [[Jon Spaihts]] perform as the voices of the ''Avalon'', InfoMat, video game, observatory, and Autodoc, respectively.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn Jon Spaihts's original 2007 script, Aurora's surname was Dunn.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/passengers-michael-sheen-jennifer-lawrence-chris-pratt-1201535570/ |title=Michael Sheen Joins Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in 'Passengers' |last=Kroll |first=Justin |date=July 17, 2015 |newspaper=Variety |language=en|access-date=November 25, 2016}}</ref> At one point in the film's development, it was set to star [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Emily Blunt]].<ref>Hawkes, Rebecca (November 24, 2016).
