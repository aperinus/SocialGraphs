The score was composed by [[Michael Giacchino]]. Like many Pixar shorts, it is completely free of dialogue and vocal effects, instead using music (played by the characters) and pantomime to tell the story. Unlike most Pixar shorts, which are driven solely by storyboarding and scriptwriting, the music in ''One Man Band'' was developed alongside the film's story; Giacchino collaborated extensively with the film's directors due to the music's large role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pixar.com/one-man-band/#one-man-band-2 |title=One Man Band |website=pixar.com |publisher=Disney-Pixar |access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 2006, it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], but lost to ''[[The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation]]'' by John Canemaker and Peggy Stern. It was included in the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]] in 2005.\n\n== Plot ==\nBass, a skilled and proud [[Busking|street performer]], plays a routine tune on his wind and percussion instruments in a deserted Italian [[village]] [[town square|square]] in the afternoon, waiting for a [[pedestrian]] to tip him in his rusty iron cup. Soon, he spots Tippy, a humble peasant girl clutching a big [[gold coin]], intending to drop it in the large plaza [[fountain]] to make a wish. Bass, seizing the opportunity, immediately plays an [[impromptu]] piece, capturing the girl's attention.\n\nJust when Tippy is about to drop the coin into Bass's cup, a newcomer steps onto the scene. Treble, a suave and flamboyant street performer, plays a more attractive tune on his string instruments, effectively stealing Tippy's attention, much to Bass's anger. Not to be outdone, Bass ups his ante, and Treble dares to take it even further. As the two unleash their arsenal of musical weapons, vying for Tippy's attention (or rather, tip), she cowers in their wild musical cacophony, and in the process, accidentally drops her coin, which falls down a drain and is lost in the village sewers.\n\nHeartbroken, Tippy sniffles, but then angrily demands from Treble and Bass a replacement coin for the one they made her lose. When they come up empty-handed, Tippy takes one of Treble's violins and Bass's iron cup in an attempt to get her money back by playing solo. She tunes the violin and plays it like a true [[virtuoso]], prompting a passing pedestrian to drop a large bag of gold coins onto her cup.\n\nElated, Tippy hugs the bag and approaches the fountain, but not before she pulls two coins out of her bag and tempts Treble and Bass. But as they eagerly reach out to grab the coins, she tosses them into the top of the fountain, out of reach, much to their dismay.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], it is nighttime, with Treble standing on Bass, trying to reach the coins. As they start to fall backward, the film ends.\n\n==Production==\nBeginning development shortly after the completion of the superhero movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''One Man Band'' was directed by Andrew Jiminez and [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], who had previously worked together on films such as ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref name=\"directors\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Dueling-Pixar-directors-Andrew-Jimenez-and-Mark-2503098.php|title = Dueling Pixar directors Andrew Jimenez and Mark Andrews translate their one-upmanship into an Oscar-nominated short|date = 27 February 2006}}</ref> In late 2004, they were approached by [[Ed Catmull]] and asked to visit his office; according to the duo, they were initially concerned about the implications of this, but were later relieved after Catmull requested that they begin working on a brand new short film for [[Pixar]].<ref name=\"directors\"/> Jiminez and Andrews decided to create a film centered around music, a subject which they were both decidedly passionate about, and began developing a story about two musicians quarreling over the donation of a young peasant girl. The short was pitched to Pixar CEO [[John Lasseter]] and ''The Incredibles'' director [[Brad Bird]], who quickly accepted the film for production.<ref name=\"directors\"/>\n\n== Music ==\nThe violinists featured in the score for the film are:\n* Clayton Haslop (\"Treble\")\n* Mark Robertson (\"Tippy\")\n\nThe score was recorded at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood, CA.
