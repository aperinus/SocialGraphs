Macy]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Heather Graham]], [[Elijah Wood]] and Estevez himself. The screenplay is a fictionalized account of the hours leading up to the June 5, 1968, [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|shooting]] of U.S. Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in the kitchen of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles following his win of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic presidential primary]] in California.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nThe film recreates the ambiance of the era and invokes the hopes inspired by Kennedy through the use of actual broadcast and newsfilm footage of the [[United States Senate|senator]] intercut with dramatic sequences involving mostly fictional characters. It uses an ensemble plot device similar to that employed in the 1932 film ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', and by [[Robert Altman]] in ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''.\n\nThe characters include John Casey, a retired hotel doorman who spends his days in the lobby playing chess with his friend Nelson; Diane, who is marrying her friend William with the hope his marital status will have him [[Military deployment|deployed]] to a [[military base]] in Germany rather than the [[Vietnam War|battlefields of Vietnam]] when his [[tour of duty]] begins; Virginia Fallon, an alcoholic singer whose career is on the downswing, her put-upon husband/manager Tim, and her agent Phil; Miriam Ebbers, a beautician who works in the hotel salon, and her husband Paul, the hotel manager, who is having an affair with [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] operator Angela; food and beverage manager Daryl Timmons, whose racist attitude gets him fired; African American [[sous chef]] Edward Robinson and [[Mexican American]] [[busboy]]s Jos\u00e9 and Miguel; hotel coffee shop waitress Susan; Jimmy and Cooper, campaign volunteers who are sidetracked by an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] trip they take with the help of drug dealer Fisher; married socialites and campaign donors Samantha and Jack; campaign manager Wade and staffer Dwayne, who is in love with Angela's colleague, Patricia; and [[Czechoslovakian]] reporter Lenka Jan\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, who is determined to get an interview with Kennedy.\n\nAt the end of the film, Kennedy is shot after giving his acceptance speech. A man named [[Sirhan Sirhan]] would be convicted of the killing. After being shot, Kennedy is cradled and protected by Jose until help arrives. As Kennedy's speech \"[[On the Mindless Menace of Violence]]\", delivered in 1968 to the [[City Club of Cleveland|City Club]] of [[Cleveland]], Ohio, is played over the aftermath, it is revealed that Samantha, Daryl, Cooper, Jimmy and William are among those injured by Sirhan's wild firing. Sirhan is apprehended, while Kennedy is rushed into an ambulance (as are the others eventually), and everyone else is moved by the events that have just taken place. Closing titles reveal that Kennedy died of his injuries the following morning with his wife [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel]] at his side, and the other victims of the shooting survived.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Harry Belafonte]] as Nelson\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Patricia\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Dwayne Clark\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Tim Fallon\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Edward Robinson\n* Dave Fraunces as [[Robert F.

Suffering from [[writer's block]], he checked into a motel in [[Pismo Beach]] where he hoped, free from interruption, he could make some headway with his writing. While talking to the woman working at the front desk, he discovered she had been in the Ambassador Hotel on the evening Kennedy was shot, and later married two young men to help them avoid the draft. Estevez used her experience to mold the character of Diane, and the rest of the story fell into place.\n\nThe five other characters \"shot\" in the assassination scene do not coincide with the five actual victims&mdash;William Weisel of [[ABC News]], Paul Schrade of the [[United Auto Workers]] union, Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans, Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service and 17-year-old Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900110-3,00.html |title=A Life On The Way To Death |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1968-06-14 |access-date=2018-01-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501101804/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C900110-3%2C00.html |archive-date=May 1, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The only other character based on a real person is busboy Jos\u00e9, who represents Juan Romero, the young man who was photographed cradling Kennedy's body immediately after he was shot.

Drysdale did in fact achieve his sixth shutout on June 4, 1968, and was congratulated by Kennedy during the victory speech he delivered just before being shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://baseballbiography.com/don-drysdale-1936 |title=Don Drysdale at |publisher=baseballbiography.com |access-date=2013-02-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Mark Isham]], with \"[[Never Gonna Break My Faith]]\" written by [[Bryan Adams]] and performed by [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mary J.

Some of the stories feel too obviously melodramatic, while others are vague to the point of inscrutability.
