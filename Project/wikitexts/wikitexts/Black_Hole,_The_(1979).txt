The film stars [[Maximilian Schell]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Joseph Bottoms]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]], while the voices of the main robot characters are provided by [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Slim Pickens]] (both uncredited). The music for the film was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. With a production budget of $20 million, plus another $6 million for advertising,<ref name=\"budget\" /><ref name=\"Cinefantastique\" /> it was at the time the most expensive picture ever produced by Disney.<ref name=remake/>\n\nIn the early 1970s, the film was initially conceived as a space-themed disaster film. However, the script went through numerous iterations from various screenwriters. Additionally, Disney's effects department used computerized camera technology to create the visual effects. The film was released on December 18, 1979, in the United Kingdom and on December 21, 1979, in the United States. It was the first film from Walt Disney Productions to receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|PG rating]]. The film received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $35 million at the US box office. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrI8-5eiyWI Vittorio Storaro winning the Oscar\u00ae for Cinematography for \"Apocalypse Now\" - Oscars on YouTube]</ref> and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcwd40G4NFk \"Alien\" winning the Oscar\u00ae for Visual Effects - Oscars on YouTube]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe spacecraft USS ''Palomino'' has nearly completed its mission exploring deep space. The crew consists of Captain Dan Holland, First Officer Lieutenant Charlie Pizer, journalist Harry Booth, [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]-sensitive scientist Dr. Kate McCrae, the expedition's civilian leader Dr. Alex Durant and the diminutive [[robot]] V.I.N.CENT. (\"Vital Information Necessary CENTralized\").\n\nAs it is returning to Earth, the ''Palomino'' discovers a [[black hole]] with the apparently abandoned and long-lost USS ''Cygnus'' nearby, the same ship that McCrae's father was aboard when it vanished 20 years ago. ([[Cygnus X-1]] is the first-known black hole, discovered in 1964, after which this scientific vessel is presumably named.) The ''Palomino'' decide to investigate and finds that there is a mysterious null gravity field surrounding the ''Cygnus'' that allows it to defy the massive gravitational pull of the black hole. The ''Palomino'' briefly strays outside the field and is damaged by the intense gravity, forcing it to emergency [[Spacecraft docking|dock]] with the ''Cygnus'', which no longer appears abandoned.\n\nThe cautious ''Palomino'' crew soon encounter Dr. Hans Reinhardt (one of Earth's most brilliant scientists, according to Durant). Reinhardt explains he has been alone on the ''Cygnus'' since it encountered a meteor field and was disabled. He ordered the human crew to return to Earth without him, but Kate's father chose to remain aboard and has since died. To replace the crew, Reinhardt built faceless, black-robed drones, sentry robots and his sinister bodyguard robot, Maximilian. Reinhardt says he intends to fly the ''Cygnus'' through the black hole because 20 years of study has shown that it's possible. Only an enamoured Durant believes him and asks if he can accompany Reinhardt.\n\nHowever, the rest of the ''Palomino'' crew start to become suspicious of Reinhardt. Booth sees a drone limping, while Holland witnesses an android funeral and discovers personal items in the ''Cygnus'' crew quarters. V.I.N.CENT. meets a battered earlier model of his type named BO.B. (\"BiO-sanitation Battalion\"). BO.B explains the drones are actually what's left of the human crew, who [[Mutiny|mutinied]] when Reinhardt refused to return to Earth after the ''Cygnus'' was damaged. McCrae's father was killed leading the mutiny, and the crew was [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] and \"reprogrammed\" to serve Reinhardt. V.I.N.CENT. uses [[telepathy]] to tell Kate. After she informs Durant what really happened, he removes a drone's faceplate, revealing the zombie-like face of a crew member. Durant tries to flee with Kate, but is killed by Maximilian.\n\nReinhardt orders his robots to lobotomize Kate, but just as the process begins, she is rescued by Holland, V.I.N.CENT. and BO.B. Harry Booth tries to escape alone in the ''Palomino'', but is shot down and fatally crashes into the ''Cygnus''. A subsequent [[Meteor shower|meteor storm]] and the explosion of the ship's overstressed main power plant cause the anti-gravity generator to fail. Without its null-gravity bubble, the ''Cygnus'' quickly starts to break apart under the black hole's huge gravitational forces.\n\nReinhardt and the ''Palomino'' survivors separately plan their escape in the [[Space probe|probe ship]] used to study the black hole. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the ship for launch, but then a large viewscreen falls on Reinhardt, pinning him to the deck, surrounded by his lobotomized crew. Maximilian encounters the ''Palomino'' crew and fatally damages BO.B. before being disabled by V.I.N.CENT and left to drift. Holland, Pizer, McCrae and V.I.N.CENT. launch the probe, which has a pre-programmed flight path that takes them into the black hole.\n\nWithin the black hole, Reinhardt and Maximilian merge together above a burning, [[hell]]ish landscape populated by dark-robed spectres resembling ''Cygnus'' drones.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moss |first=Joshua |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/movies/black_hole_retrospective_000602.html |title=Does The Black Hole still suck? |work=[[Space.com]] |date=June 2, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040210230511/http://space.com/sciencefiction/movies/black_hole_retrospective_000602.html |archive-date=February 10, 2004}}</ref> Meanwhile, the probe ship is led through a cathedral-like [[Heaven|arched crystal tunnel]] by a floating, angelic figure.

Miller|Ron Miller]], who assigned longtime studio producer [[Winston Hibler]] to help develop the project. An idea of Hibler was for a black hole to be featured in the story. After nearly a year of work on the project, Hibler was not satisfied with the later story drafts, so William Wood was added to rework the script. Ultimately, Hibler retired from the Disney studios. The project was later shelved until late 1975 when development resumed on the project now re-titled ''Space Probe One''.<ref name=hollyreporter/> In 1976, Hibler returned from retirement, and suggested to Miller to hire conceptual artist [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert McCall]] to create some pre-production visuals to help focus the story and explore some possible ideas.<ref name= \"MousePlanet\">{{cite web |last=Korkis |first=Jim |url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/12451/Inside_Disneys_The_Black_Hole |title=Inside Disney's The Black Hole |website=MousePlanet.com |date=August 14, 2019 |access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHibler also brought matte designer [[Peter Ellenshaw]] out of retirement to create conceptual designs on the proposed film.<ref>{{cite news| last= Lawson|first=Terry|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/392006005/| title=The Good Ship Disney Rockets into the space war|newspaper=[[Dayton Daily News|The Journal-Herald]]|date=December 15, 1979|via= [[Newspapers.com]]| format=Subscription required|access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.byyourcommand.net/cylongallery/thumbnails.php?album=1278&page=1|title=The Black Hole - Part One: The Evolution of a Film|magazine= Mediascene Prevue|date=September\u2013October 1979|issue=39|pages=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe story has been compared to ''[[20,000 Leagues under the Sea]]'' albeit in space.<ref name=hollyreporter/>\n\n===Writing===\nFour months later, director [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]], who had just directed ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (1975), was approached to direct the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Mark|title=Frozen in Ice: The Story of Walt Disney Productions, 1966-1985|date=October 31, 2013|publisher= BearManor Media|isbn=978-1593937515}}</ref> Although he liked the premise, he felt the script needed more revisions, so he brought in [[Sumner Arthur Long]] for an additional rewrite.

In October, writer Ed Coffey was added to rewrite the script. By February 1977, Jeb Rosebrook was included to restructure the story, in which the script was then changed to focus on a small core group of astronauts who would encounter a black hole, which was a phenomenon that had been a growing discussion within the scientific community.<ref name=\"MousePlanet\" /><ref>{{cite book| last=Telotte|first=J.P.|title=The Mouse Machine: Disney and Technology |chapter=Course Correction: Of Black Holes and Computer Games|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|isbn=978-0252075407|date=June 9, 2008|pages=144\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"Cinefantastique\">{{cite magazine|last= Sammon|first=Paul|title=The Black Hole| url= https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Cinefantastique/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2009%20No%201%20%281979%29.pdf|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=9|issue=1|date=Fall 1979|page=6|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829050538/https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Cinefantastique/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2009%20No%201%20(1979).pdf|archivedate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile the script was again being rewritten, Hough left the project and decided to direct ''[[Brass Target]]'' (1978).<ref name=\"MousePlanet\" /> In December 1977, Miller then approached [[Gary Nelson (director)|Gary Nelson]], who had just been nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series|Primetime Emmy]] on the political miniseries ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'', to direct the project.

Disney wanted to rent equipment from [[Industrial Light and Magic]], but it was unavailable during the film's production period and was prohibitively expensive. In the end, Disney turned to its own engineering department, which created the ACES (Automated Camera Effects System). The computerized system allowed for the camera to take [[double exposure]] photographs of the miniature models as it moves convincingly across the matte painting. It also permitted the actors to move unrestrictedly within a matte painting, and the camera tracks them within a non-existent set that would be painted in later.<ref>{{cite news| last=Culhane| first= John| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/the-black-hole-casts-the-computer-as-moviemaker.html |title='The Black Hole' Casts The Computer as Movie\u2010Maker| newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 16, 1979|access-date= August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Artof\">{{cite magazine |url= https://www.byyourcommand.net/cylongallery/thumbnails.php?album=1280|title=The Black Hole - Part Three: The Art of Peter Ellenshaw| magazine=Mediascene Prevue|issue=39|date=September\u2013October 1979|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> The Mattescan system was then used to composite live-action shots onto a single matte painting while the camera is in motion on several axes.<ref>{{cite magazine| last= Sammons| first= Paul| url=https://www.byyourcommand.net/cylongallery/thumbnails.php?album=1171&page=1|title=Inside The Black Hole - As Told by Disney's Special Effects Experts|magazine= Cinefantastique |volume=9|number=3\u20134|date= Spring 1980|pages=4\u201363}}</ref> In total, 150 matte paintings were created for the film under the supervision of [[Harrison Ellenshaw]], but only 13 were used in the film.<ref name=\"Artof\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\nDisney hired [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], famous as the composer of the ''[[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' films, to compose the film's score.
