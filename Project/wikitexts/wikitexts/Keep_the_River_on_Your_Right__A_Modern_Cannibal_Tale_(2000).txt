In the film, Schneebaum, by then an elderly man, revisits two cannibal tribes\u2014one in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the other in the jungles of [[Peru]]\u2014with whom he had lived several years each as a young man. He and the filmmakers manage to locate a few of the individuals he had known well during those periods.\n\n==Personal participation==\nSchneebaum is remarkably honest about his same-sex relationships with members of both tribes, his childhood fetishizing of cannibalism, and his actual tasting of human flesh with one group. His extensive training in art allowed him to bond with different cultures he studied through sharing carving and painting techniques.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film won a 2001 [[Independent Spirit Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextwavefilms.com/river/index.html|title=Welcome to Next Wave Films|website=www.nextwavefilms.com|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0206187}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about LGBT topics]]\n[[Category:Works about cannibalism]]\n[[Category:Anthropology documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000 documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n\n\n{{LGBT-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
