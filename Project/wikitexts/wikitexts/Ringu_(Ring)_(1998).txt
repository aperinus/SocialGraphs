The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]], [[Miki Nakatani]] and [[Hiroyuki Sanada]], and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed [[video tape]]; whoever watches the tape dies seven days after doing so. The film is titled '''''The Ring''''' (stylized as '''''the Ring''''') in English in Japan and released as '''''Ringu''''' in North America and '''''Ring: Circle of Evil''''' in the Philippines.\n\nProduction took approximately nine months.<ref name=\"nakatainterview\" /> ''Ring'' and its sequel ''[[Spiral (1998 film)|Spiral]]'' were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, ''Ring'' was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups in the [[The Ring (franchise)|''Ring'' franchise]], popularized [[Japanese horror]] (or \"J-horror\") internationally, and triggered a trend of Western [[remakes]] of J-horror films, including the 2002 American film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a video tape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week she and her friends watched a strange video tape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. They receive a false alarm phone call, then Masami goes to the toilet. Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is killed by an unseen presence.\n\nTomoko's aunt, journalist [[Reiko Asakawa]], investigates this legend and learns during Tomoko's funeral that the three friends who watched the tape with Tomoko died at the same time as her. Reiko visits Izu Pacific Land Resort, where the four friends were staying, and discovers an unmarked video tape. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call that emits the screeching sounds from the tape.\n\nConvinced that she has been cursed, Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]]. Ry\u016bji watches the tape despite Reiko's concerns and agrees to help her. Dissecting a copy of the tape Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an [[Izu \u014cshima|\u014cshima]] dialect. Before departing to \u014cshima, Reiko catches her and Ry\u016bji\u2019s seven-year-old son [[Yoichi Asakawa|Y\u014dichi]] watching the tape after being told to do so by \"Tomoko\". In \u014cshima, Reiko and Ry\u016bji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, who, prior to her suicide, gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organised by [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] researcher Dr Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Takashi, Shizuko's brother who extorted her, the pair learn through a vision that, during the demonstration, Shizuko's young daughter [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]] psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko's abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realises that Ry\u016bji never received a phone call after watching the tape as she did at the cabin in Izu. After a boat ride back to the mainland provided by Takashi, the pair rush to the cabin to investigate.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji find a sealed well in the cabin's crawlspace and, through another vision, learn that Dr Ikuma bludgeoned Sadako, pushed her into this well, and trapped her inside. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a video tape \"recorded\" [[Thoughtography|the rage she had projected]]. When draining the water, they find Sadako's remains, and, since Reiko does not die despite having passed her deadline, believe the curse is broken.\n\nThe next day, Ry\u016bji finds his TV turn on by itself, showing the well at the end of the video tape. Sadako's [[Onry\u014d|vengeful spirit]] staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward him and frightening him to death. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ry\u016bji at the time, hears his last moments over the phone. Guided by an apparition, she deduces the actual way to break the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days, effectively letting the curse spread. Reiko realises that while she did this, Ry\u016bji did not. Desperate to save Y\u014dichi, Reiko drives to her father's home to show him the tape.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nanako Matsushima]] as [[Reiko Asakawa]], a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed video tape.\n* [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]], Reiko's former husband, a former medical student turned university professor. He has a degree of [[extrasensory perception|sixth sense]] that detects supernatural auras.\n* [[Rikiya Otaka|Rikiya \u014ctaka]] as [[Yoichi Asakawa|Y\u014dichi Asakawa]], Reiko's young son who also has a sixth sense like his father.\n* [[Miki Nakatani]] as Mai Takano, Ryuji's student.\n* [[Y\u016bko Takeuchi|Yuko Takeuchi]] as Tomoko \u014cishi, Reiko's niece who watches the cursed video tape and is amongst its first victims.\n* [[Hitomi Sat\u014d (actress)|Hitomi Sato]] as Masami Kurahashi, Tomoko's best friend.\n* [[Daisuke Ban]] as Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, Sadako's father who threw her down a well.\n* [[Rie In\u014d]] as [[Sadako Yamamura]], a young woman with psychic powers who was thrown down a well where she died; her spirit lived on within a video tape.\n* Masako as Shizuko Yamamura, Sadako's mother. She too had psychic powers but a disastrous press demonstration led to her suicide.\n* [[Y\u014dichi Numata]] as Takashi Yamamura, Sadako's uncle who runs an inn on Oshima Island.\n* [[Yutaka Matsushige]] as Yoshino, a journalist associate of Reiko.\n* Katsumi Muramatsu as K\u014dichi Asakawa, Reiko's father.\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\nCritics have discussed ''Ring''{{'}}s preoccupations with Japanese tradition's collision with [[modernity]]. Colette Balmain identifies: \"In the figure of Sadako, ''Ring'' [utilises the] vengeful [[y\u016brei]] archetype of conventional Japanese horror\". She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a video tape which \"embodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\".<ref name=\"Balmain 2008\" />\n\nRuth Goldberg argues that ''Ring'' expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\". She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her \"natural\" role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a [[Uncanny|doubling effect]] whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Ruth|editor-last1=Grant|editor-first1=Barry Keith|editor-link1=Barry Keith Grant|editor-last2=Sharrett|editor-first2=Christopher|date=2004|chapter=Demons in the Family|title=Planks of Reason|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|pages=370\u2013385}}</ref>\n\nJay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on.<ref name=\"McRoy 2007\" /> Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.<ref name=\"Balmain 2008\" />\n\n===Title===\nThe film's title, ''Ring'', can be interpreted in several ways, such as alluding to the never ending cyclical nature of the ring curse/virus.
