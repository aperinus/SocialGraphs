Jackson]]), now suffers from [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and lives in a cave in [[Inwood Park]], New York. He believes that a man named Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant is controlling the world with rays from the top of the [[Chrysler Building]], and that his mind is inhabited by moth-like [[seraph]]s. On [[Valentine\u2019s Day]], he discovers the frozen body of a young man, Scotty Gates (Sean MacMahon), left in a tree outside his cave. The police, including Romulus's daughter Lulu ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), dismiss the man's death as an accident. However, a homeless ex-lover of Scotty tells Romulus that he was murdered by the famous photographer David Leppenraub ([[Colm Feore]]). Determined to discover the truth behind Scotty\u2019s death and prove his worth to his daughter, Romulus manages to get an invitation through a former friend to perform one of his compositions at Leppenraub\u2019s farm. What unfolds thereafter is a twisted tale of mystery, deception, and a man's struggle against his own mind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Samuel L.
