After a failed bombing attack in London, Collette is arrested and offered a choice by an MI5 officer, Mac, who is assigned as her handler. Either she spends 25 years in jail, thus losing everything she loves, including her young son. Or, she becomes an informant for [[MI5]], spying on her own family. Collette agrees to inform. In return, Mac offers her a new identity after working for MI5.\n\nSoon Mac learns that his superior Kate Fletcher is using Collette to protect Fletcher's own [[mole (espionage)|mole]] inside the Irish organization. Mac tries to find the identity of this informer to protect Collette. Additionally, a romantic interest develops between Mac and Collette, evidenced by a passionate kiss shared at their weekly meeting at a quay.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin, an IRA enforcer, realizing a mole exists within Collette's family, gets closer and closer to Collette. Mac's superiors refuse to remove her from danger. Finally, Kevin concludes that either Collette or her brother Connor is the mole. Gerry, Collette's oldest brother, gives passive consent for Kevin to interrogate Connor and Collette. Connor is tortured, but gives no information, and just as Connor is about to be executed, Kevin calls it off.\n\nAt the same time, Mac breaks into secret archives and determines that Fletcher's mole is Collette's mother, confirming that he has been used surreptitiously by his superiors, who were only interested in Collette as a shield for her mother's treachery. Mac makes a phone call to Collette's mother, informing her that the IRA will be coming to pick up Collette, and that Collette was recruited to protect her. However, when Kevin arrives to pick up Collette, her mother goes outside and enters Kevin's car. Later, her dead body is found, apparently by execution, showing that Kevin had determined the mother was the mole.\n\nMac makes a phone call to Collette and apparently acting alone, outside the permission of his superiors, informs her that he can get her and her son out of Northern Ireland. Mac arrives at their usual meeting spot the quay, but Collette does not come. When he answers his car phone, a car bomb explodes, killing him.\n\nThe film ends with Collette and her son getting into a car with her brother Connor. Connor tells Collette that \"it's done\" and they leave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Colette McVeigh\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Mac\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Kate Fletcher\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Gerry McVeigh\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Connor McVeigh\n* [[Brid Brennan]] as Ma\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]] as Kevin Mulville\n* [[Michael McElhatton]] as Liam Hughes\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Ian Gilmour\n* [[Martin McCann (actor)|Martin McCann]] as Brendan O'Shea\n\n==Reception==\n{{RT data|as of|y|m}}, the film holds {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on {{RT data|count}} reviews with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
