Copenhagen is not just another European city for William; it is also the city of his father's birth. When Effy, working in William's hotel, befriends the twenty-eight year-old William they set off on an adventure to deliver a letter written by William's father, to his father, after he was abandoned when eight years old. Along the way, thanks to Effy's persistence, they uncover William's family's sordid past.\n\nAn attraction builds between William and Effy. They explore a museum where William caresses Effy's face and nearly kisses her before they are interrupted. Effy has been evasive about her age, but when pressed makes the startling revelation that she is not a hotel employee, but is a 14-year-old doing her grammar school ''praktik'' (internship) at the hotel.\n\nOne night at a bar William sees Effy being dragged out of the bar by an older man, who is revealed to be Effy's mother's boyfriend. William manages to stop the man from dragging Effy away and beats him up, causing both him and Effy to flee the scene.\n\nWilliam sneaks Effy inside his hotel room. After talking with him for a short while, Effy tells William that she loves him and asks him if he wants her. He replies yes, but expresses hesitancy because of her age. They start undressing and kiss, before William stops, covers the topless Effy with a sheet, and holds her close. In the next scene it is morning, and Effy awakes fully clothed. William is sitting atop the bedclothes; she is under them.\n\nEffy translates Daniel's letter to his father for William. He thanks her, and they go their separate ways. Effy returns to her mother's apartment, where her mom's boyfriend tries to make up with her. Effy evades his touch and says she is going to tell her mother. William soon arrives at the home of his grandfather and delivers his father's letter to the grandfather he had never known.\n\nBack at school, Effy quietly looks at several pictures she had taken with William and smiles at one of her sleeping in the hotel room she had shared with William. At the same time, William stands at the symbolic [[Skagen]], where the North Sea meets the Baltic.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gethin Anthony]] \u2013 William\n*[[Frederikke Dahl Hansen]] \u2013 Effy\n*[[Sebastian Armesto]] \u2013 Jeremy\n*[[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] \u2013 Jennifer\n*[[Baard Owe]] \u2013 Uncle Mads\n*[[Mille Dinesen]] \u2013 Effy's mother\n*{{ill|Martin Hestb\u00e6k|dk}} \u2013 Henrik\n*[[Tamzin Merchant]] \u2013 Sandra\n*{{ill|Preben Ravn|dk}} \u2013 Thomas Vinter\n*Sebastian Bull Sarning - Albert\n*{{ill|Gordon Kennedy (Danish actor)|dk|lt=Gordon Kennedy}} \u2013 Uncle Peter\n*Sune Kofoed \u2013 receptionist Madsen\n*Silja Eriksen Jensen \u2013 Signe\n*{{ill|Julie Christiansen (actor)|dk|lt=Julie Christiansen}} \u2013 Berlin girl\n*Asbj\u00f8rn Krogh Nissen \u2013 Ivan\n*Zaki Nobel Mehabil \u2013 bartender Markus\n*{{ill|Thomas Buttensch\u00f8n|dk}} - Thomas Buttensch\u00f8n\n*Miriam Yeager - school teacher\n*Sune Kaarsberg - office secretary (voice)\n*K\u00e5re Fjalland - priest\n*Jane Pejtersen - Dane on bridge\t \n*H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kuhn - Heather\n*Mads Korsgaard - hostel bartender\n*Lars-Bo Johansen - karaoke singer\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by Fidelio Films and Scorched Films.
