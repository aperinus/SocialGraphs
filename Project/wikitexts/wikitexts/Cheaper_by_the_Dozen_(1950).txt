The film and book describe growing up in a family with twelve children, in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. The title comes from one of Gilbreth's favorite jokes, which played out in the film, that when he and his family were out driving and stopped at a red light, a pedestrian would ask: \"Hey, mister! How come you got so many kids?\" Gilbreth would pretend to ponder the question carefully, and then, just as the light turned green, would say: \"Well, they come cheaper by the dozen, you know\", and drive off.\n\nThe story of the Gilbreth family is continued in the book ''[[Belles on Their Toes]]'', which was adapted as a [[Belles on Their Toes (film)|film in 1952]], with some of the original cast.\n\n==Plot==\nThe parents are the [[time and motion study]] and efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.]] and [[psychologist]] [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]]. The film shows typical days in the lives of a family in the 1920s, but here with 12 children and an efficiency engineer as the parent. Frank employs his unorthodox teaching methods on his children, and there are clashes between parents and children.\n\nFrank takes every opportunity to study motion and increase efficiency, including filming his children's tonsillectomies to see if there are ways to streamline the operation.\nHe escorts his daughter to her prom as a chaperone but ends up chatting and dancing with her female friends.\n\nAt the end, Frank is sent on a lecture tour to Europe, expecting to visit [[Prague]] and [[London]]. He phones Lillian from the station but the line goes dead as he has had a heart attack. After Frank's sudden death, the family agree that Lillian will continue with her husband's work, beginning with giving his lectures in Europe; this enables the family to remain in their house, rather than move to their grandmother's in California, although, with a widowed working mother and one income, the children will have to assume much greater responsibilities.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Clifton Webb]] as [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth]] (father)\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Mrs. Lillian Gilbreth (mother)\n* [[Jeanne Crain]] as Ann Gilbreth \n* [[Barbara Bates]] as Ernestine Gilbreth\n* Betty Barker as Mary Gilbreth\n* Patti Brady as Martha Gilbreth\n* Norman Ollestad as Frank Gilbreth Jr.\n* [[Carol Nugent]] as Lillie Gilbreth \n* [[Jimmy Hunt]] as William Gilbreth\n* [[Anthony Sydes]] as Fred Gilbreth\n* Teddy Driver as Dan Gilbreth\n* Roddy McCaskill as Jack Gilbreth\n* [[Walter Baldwin]] as Jim Bracken\n* [[Sara Allgood]] as Mrs. Monahan \n* [[Evelyn Varden]] as School Principal\n* [[Edgar Buchanan]] as Dr. Burton \n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mrs. Mebane \n* [[Craig Hill (actor)|Craig Hill]] as Tom\n* [[Betty Lynn]] as Deborah Lancaster\n}}\n\n==Comparison to real life==\nThe birth order in which ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' portrays some of the children is not the same order in which the real Gilbreth children were born. For example, Robert (who was born in 1920) is shown as being born in 1922, as the last child after Jane (who was born in 1922). This is reversed in the movie's sequel.\n\nIn real life, Mary, who was the second child, died in 1912, aged 5. However, in the film ''Cheaper by the Dozen'', Mary is placed as the third child after Ernestine, and has few or no lines.<ref>{{cite web|website=TCM|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70716/Cheaper-by-the-Dozen/articles.html|title=Cheaper by the Dozen}}</ref>\n\nBoth Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were important figures in real life. The voice-over at the end of the film informs the audience that Lillian went on to become the world's leading efficiency expert and Woman of the Year in 1948, a title bestowed by the [[Twentieth Century Club (Buffalo, New York)|Twentieth Century Club of Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Buffalo.edu|url=https://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/items/show/88298#:~:text=Woman%20of%20the%20Year%20for,Club%20of%20Buffalo%20by%20Mrs.htm|title=1948 Woman of the Year}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nReviews from critics were mostly positive.
