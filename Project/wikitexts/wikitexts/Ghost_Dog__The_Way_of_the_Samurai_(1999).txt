[[Forest Whitaker]] stars as the title character, the mysterious \"Ghost Dog\", a [[hitman]] in the employ of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], who follows the ancient code of the [[samurai]] as outlined in the book of [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]]'s recorded sayings, ''[[Hagakure]]''. Critics have noted similarities between the movie and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s 1967 film ''[[Le Samoura\u00ef]]''.\n\nThe film opened to largely positive critical reception,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai|title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai|access-date=29 April 2019|via=www.metacritic.com}}</ref> and was nominated for both an [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature]] and a [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmindependent.org/people/forest-whitaker/|title=Forest Whitaker|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGhost Dog sees himself as a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of Louie, a local mobster, who saved Ghost Dog's life years earlier. While living as a hitman for the [[American Mafia]], he adheres to the code of the [[samurai]], and interprets and applies the wisdom of the ''[[Hagakure]]''.\n\nLouie tells Ghost Dog to kill a gangster, Handsome Frank, who is sleeping with the daughter of local mafia boss Vargo. Ghost Dog arrives and kills the gangster, before seeing that the girl is also in the room; he leaves her alive. To avoid being implicated in the murder of a [[made man]], Vargo and his associate Sonny Valerio decide to get rid of Ghost Dog. Louie knows practically nothing about Ghost Dog, as the hitman communicates only by [[homing pigeon]]. The mobsters start by tracing all the pigeon coops in town. They find Ghost Dog's cabin atop a building and kill his pigeons. Ghost Dog realizes he must kill Vargo and his men or they will kill him and his master.\n\nDuring the day, Ghost Dog frequently visits the park to see his best friend, a [[French language|French-speaking]] ice cream man named Raymond. Ghost Dog does not understand French and Raymond does not understand [[English language|English]] but the two nonetheless seem to connect with each other. Ghost Dog also befriends a little girl named Pearline, to whom he lends the book ''[[Rash\u014dmon (short story)|Rash\u014dmon]]''.\n\nEventually, Ghost Dog invades Vargo's mansion and kills almost everyone single-handedly, sparing only Louie and Vargo's daughter. That night, Ghost Dog kills Sonny Valerio at his home by shooting him through a pipe. Ghost Dog expects that Louie will attack him (as he feels that Louie is obliged to avenge the murder of his boss, Vargo). He goes to the park and gives Raymond all his money, helping him to stay in the country. Pearline appears and gives back ''Rash\u014dmon'' to Ghost Dog, saying that she liked it. Ghost Dog gives Pearline his copy of ''Hagakure'' and encourages her to read it.\n\nThough Louie feels some loyalty to Ghost Dog, he finally confronts him at Raymond's ice cream stand with Raymond and Pearline watching. Ghost Dog is unwilling to attack his master and allows Louie to kill him. His last act is to give Louie the copy of ''Rash\u014dmon'' and encourage him to read it. Pearline takes Ghost Dog's empty gun and aims at Louie as he flees. Ghost Dog dies peacefully with Raymond and Pearline at his side; Louie gets into a car with Vargo's daughter (who now has replaced her father as his boss). Later, Pearline reads the ''Hagakure''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as \"Ghost Dog\"\n* John Tormey as Louie\n* [[Henry Silva]] as Ray Vargo\n* [[Cliff Gorman]] as Sonny Valerio\n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]] as Raymond\n* [[Camille Winbush]] as Pearline\n* [[Tricia Vessey]] as Louise Vargo\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Frank \"Handsome Frank\"\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Valerio's Bodyguard\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Vinny\n* [[RZA]] as Samurai In Camouflage\n* [[Gary Farmer]] as \"Nobody\"\n* [[Shi Yan Ming]] as Kung-Fu Master\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot mostly in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], but the movie never mentions where the story is set.

On the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] review site, the film has an 82% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on reviews from 95 critics. The website's critical consensus was that the movie is \"An innovative blend of samurai and gangster lifestyles.\"<ref name=\"rotten\">{{ cite web | year = 1999 | title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | website = Rotten Tomatoes | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_dog_the_way_of_the_samurai/ | access-date= 2018-10-03 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, describing it as \"truly, profoundly weird.\" Ebert's review proposed ''Ghost Dog'' made the most sense if Whitaker's character were insane: \"In a quiet, sweet way, he is totally unhinged and has lost all touch with reality. His profound sadness, which permeates the touching Whitaker performance, comes from his alienation from human society, his loneliness, his attempt to justify inhuman behavior (murder) with a belief system (the samurai code) that has no connection with his life or his world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai-2000|title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai Movie Review (2000) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> [[J.
