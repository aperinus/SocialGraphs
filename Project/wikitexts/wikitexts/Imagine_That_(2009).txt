It centers on the relationship between a workaholic father (Murphy) and his daughter, Olivia ([[Yara Shahidi]]), whose imaginary world becomes the secret to her father's success.\n\nThe film had its premiere at the Paramount Theater on the Paramount Studios Lot in Los Angeles, California and was then widely released on June 12, 2009. Murphy was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for his work in the film. The film was a co-production between [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]]. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $25 million against a budget of $55 million.\n\n==Plot==\nEvan Danielson is a successful financial advisor, who had been working at the same securities firm for eight years as their top account manager, until Johnny Whitefeather was hired as his rival. Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under a spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. The top executives seem more content with chanting Indian-style noises rather than listening to how they can make money through sound investments.\n\nWhen Evan discovers that his daughter, Olivia is able to tell the future within the financial world by using her \"goo-gaa\" comfort [[blanket]] and her [[imaginary friends]] (Queen Qwali and Princesses Kupida, Sopida and Mopida), he discovers that he now has an invaluable upper hand at the office.\n\nDuring work, Olivia draws all over Evan's worksheets for a meeting. Outraged, Evan goes to the meeting and he shows off the paperwork and explains that ChemStar is sparkly, and Aerodyne and Yellowfin will get married, confusing his colleagues. Evan thinks he is about to be fired, but his boss informs him that all his predictions came through. The share price of ChemStar shot up, while Aerodyne and Yellowfin were preparing to merge.\n\nAfter only a few days with Olivia, Evan rediscovers his inner child, and has fun playing imaginary games with her. Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for his secret. When he learns that Evan was just playing with a wakalyapi blanket, Whitefeather pays six thousand dollars for one, forcing his son to tell him the \"future\" and keeping him up all night by making him drink cans of [[Red Bull]].\n\nWhitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of head of the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan once again needs to invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet with the princesses. However, Olivia is spending the night at her friend's house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her. Also, the presentations will be held at the time of Olivia's class play.\n\nEvan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. He returns home, tries to get the princesses' attention, then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, Evan stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing.\n\nEvan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it is Evan's turn. When he is about to present, he suddenly decides to go to Olivia's class concert, and leaves the presentation. As he drives over, Evan changes into a king costume. At the concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part when Evan appears dressed as a king, and she starts singing, delighted to see him.\n\nAfter the class concert, Evan tells Olivia how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, seemingly not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Evan and Olivia say good-bye to the princesses, as she says it's time to let them go. They both start waving and, although there's no wind, some leaves fly off into the sky.\n\nMeanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He decides to give the position to Evan because of how much he cares about his family. Evan accepts.\n\nEvan, Olivia's mother Trish, and Olivia leave happy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Evan Danielson\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Johnny Whitefeather\n* [[Yara Shahidi]] as Olivia Danielson\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Ms. Davis\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Tom Stevens\n* [[Stephen Rannazzisi]] as Noah Kulick\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Trish\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as John Strother\n* [[Vanessa Estelle Williams]] as Lori Strother\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Dante D'Enzo\n* [[Lauren Weedman]] as Rose\n* Heidi Marnhout as Cheryl Whitefeather\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Fred Franklin\n* [[Jonathan Mangum]] as Franklin's Associate\n* Mike Vorhaus as Franklin's Associate 1\n* [[Catherine McGoohan]] as Mrs. Pressman\n* [[James Patrick Stuart]] as Mr. Pratt\n* Anastasia Pineschi as School Choir Member\n* Chelsea Barker as School Choir Member\n* David Freese as School Choir Member\n* [[Traci Paige Johnson]] as Blue (voice, uncredited)\n* [[Donovan Patton]] as Joe (uncredited)\n* [[Timm Sharp]] as Todd\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe working title for the film was \"Nowhereland\".<ref>{{cite web|date=11 June 2009|last=Calhoun|first=Patricia|title=Colorado Film Commission, Take 2|url=https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-film-commission-take-2-5104086|website=Westword}}</ref>\nFilming ran from 10 September to 14 December in 2007, at locations including [[Denver]]<ref>{{cite web|title=In \"Imagine That,\" Denver gleams, the script doesn't|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2009/06/10/in-imagine-that-denver-gleams-the-script-doesnt/|website=The Denver Post|date=10 June 2009}}</ref> and [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Music==\nThe score to ''Imagine That'' was composed by [[Mark Mancina]], who recorded his score with an 83-piece ensemble of the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Sony Scoring Stage.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dan Goldwasser|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/144|title=Mark Mancina scores ''NowhereLand''|publisher=ScoringSessions.com|date=June 17, 2008|access-date=June 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film soundtrack features several covers of [[Beatles]] songs, such as \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\", \"[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]\", and two different versions of \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\", while the song \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" plays a part in the film's plot.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nOn its opening weekend, the film ran sixth, grossing $5.5 million in 3,008 theaters with an $1,830 average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=24&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for June 12\u201314, 2009|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=June 14, 2009|access-date=June 19, 2009}}</ref> The film went on to gross $22.3 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> This opening was similar to Murphy's previous summer movie, ''[[Meet Dave]]'', which also had a lackluster opening week.
