Jay, his wife Kinnu, and their daughter Mina, a family of [[Indians in Uganda|Ugandan Indians]] residing in [[Kampala]], reluctantly and tearfully leave their home behind and relocate. After spending a few years in England, the family settle in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]] to live with family members who own a chain of motels there. Despite the passage of time, Jay is unable to come to terms with his sudden departure from his home country, and cannot fully embrace the American lifestyle. He dreams of one day returning with his family to Kampala. The effects of Amin's dictatorship have caused Jay to become distrustful towards black people.\n\nMina, on the other hand, has fully assimilated to the American culture and has a diverse group of friends. She feels stifled by her parents' wish to only associate with members of their own community. She falls in love with Demetrius, a local [[African American]] self-employed carpet cleaner. Mina is aware that her parents will not approve and keeps the relationship somewhat secret. The pair decide to spend a romantic clandestine weekend together in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], where they are spotted by members of the Indian community, and the gossip begins to spread. Jay is outraged and ashamed, and forbids Mina from ever seeing Demetrius again. Mina also faces both subtle and outright dislike from Demetrius' community. Demetrius confronts Jay, who reveals his experiences and racist treatment in Uganda, causing Demetrius to call out Jay on his hypocrisy. Ultimately, the two families cannot fully come to terms with the interracial pair, who flee the state together in Demetrius's van.\n\nJay's wish finally becomes reality when he travels to Kampala to attend a court proceeding on the disposition of his previously confiscated house. While in the country however, he sees how much it has changed and realises that he no longer identifies with the land of his birth. Jay returns to America and relinquishes his long-nurtured dream of returning to Uganda, the place he considered home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Demetrius Williams\n* [[Sarita Choudhury]] as Mina\n**Sahira Nair as young Mina\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as Jay\n* [[Sharmila Tagore]] as Kinnu\n* [[Charles S.

While doing research in Mississippi, Nair met a carpet cleaner named Demetrius and decided to model the main character after him. [[Ben Kingsley]] was originally cast in the role of Mina's father, but he eventually withdrew from the project, prompting the original backers of the film to pull out. Nair was able to gain new funding after Denzel Washington was chosen for the role of Demetrius. She later mentioned she faced substantial pressure from potential backers to select white leads rather than Indians or African Americans.<ref name=muir/> The Mississippi-based scenes were filmed in Mississippi, in the towns of [[Greenwood, Mississippi|Greenwood]], [[Grenada, Mississippi|Grenada]], [[Biloxi]], and [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]].
