Written by Flagg and [[Carol Sobieski]], and starring [[Kathy Bates]], [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], [[Mary-Louise Parker]] and [[Cicely Tyson]], the film tells the story of a [[housewife]] who, unhappy with her life, befriends an elderly lady in a [[nursing home]] and is enthralled by the tales she tells of people she used to know.\n\nThe film was released in [[movie theater|theaters]] in the United States on December 27, 1991, garnered positive reviews from critics and was a box office hit, grossing $119.4 million on a $11 million budget. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[64th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Tandy) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--As of 6 February 2022: plot contains 543 words. The limit is 700 words -- see [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\n\nEvelyn Couch, a timid housewife in her 40s, meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode at an Alabama nursing home. Evelyn's husband, Ed, has an aunt living there. Over several encounters, Ninny tells Evelyn about the long-abandoned town of Whistle Stop and its residents. The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage, her life, her growing confidence, and a developing friendship with Ninny. The narrative switches several times between Ninny's story set between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and Evelyn's life in 1980s [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].\n\nNinny's tale begins with [[tomboy]] Idgie Threadgoode, the youngest member of her family, who would later become Ninny's sister-in-law. Young Idgie is devastated when her beloved older brother, Buddy, is killed by a train. She remains socially withdrawn well into her adolescence. At the Threadgoode family's request, Buddy's former girlfriend, the straitlaced Ruth Jamison, intervenes.\n\nIdgie initially rebuffs Ruth's attempt at friendship, but over the summer they gradually develop a deep attachment. Ruth eventually moves to [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to marry Frank Bennett. When Idgie visits, she discovers that Frank habitually abuses a pregnant Ruth. Against Frank's violent attempts to stop her, Ruth returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie, where her baby, Buddy Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business and help care for Ruth and Buddy Jr. She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing the family cook, Sipsey, and her son, Big George, whose excellent barbecue becomes popular with customers.\n\nFrank returns to Whistle Stop to kidnap his infant son, but an unseen assailant thwarts his attempt; Frank is soon reported missing. About five years later, Frank's truck surfaces in a nearby river. Idgie becomes a suspect, having publicly threatened Frank for beating Ruth. Sheriff Grady Kilgore detains both Idgie and Big George. Kilgore offers to release Idgie and pin Frank's supposed murder solely on Big George, but Idgie refuses. During the subsequent trial, Reverend Scroggins provides false testimony that supports both Idgie's and Big George's alibis. Taking into account Frank's reputation for drunkenness and his body never being found, the judge rules his probable death as accidental and drops all charges against Idgie and Big George.\n\nShortly after the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with terminal cancer and soon dies. When trains stop running through Whistle Stop, the caf\u00e9 closes, and the town folk drift away. Ninny's story concludes, but not before Frank's fate is revealed. When Frank attempted to kidnap Buddy Jr., Sipsey hit Frank over the head with a cast iron skillet, killing him. Frank's truck was pushed into the river, and Idgie convinced Big George to butcher and barbecue Frank's body, which they later served to Sheriff Curtis Smoot, who relentlessly investigated Frank's disappearance. Smoot proclaimed the meal as the best barbecue he ever ate.\n\nEvelyn discovers Ninny was discharged from the nursing home. During her stay there, Ninny's house was condemned and demolished. Evelyn finds Ninny where the house once stood. She wants Ninny to live with her and Ed, to which Ninny agrees. They pass by Ruth's grave which is freshly adorned with a jar containing honey and a honeycomb. A card reads, \"I'll always love you, the Bee Charmer\". The Bee Charmer was Ruth's nickname for Idgie, and the note reveals that Idgie is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Evelyn Couch\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Imogene \"Idgie\" Threadgoode\n** Nancy Moore Atchison as Young Idgie Threadgoode\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Ruth Jamison\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as Ninny Threadgoode\n* [[Cicely Tyson]] as Sipsey\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Buddy Threadgoode\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Big George\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as Ed Couch\n* [[Timothy Scott (actor, born 1937)|Tim Scott]] as Smokey Lonesome\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as Grady Kilgore\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mama Threadgoode\n* Danny Nelson as Papa Threadgoode\n* [[Jo Harvey Allen]] as Women's Awareness Teacher\n* [[Macon McCalman]] as Prosecutor\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Reverend Scroggins\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Curtis Smoot\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Eva Bates\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Frank Bennett\n* [[Constance Shulman]] as Missy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nJon Avnet first read the novel in 1987.<ref name=DVDcommentary>{{cite AV media|people=[[Jon Avnet|Avnet, Jon]] (director) |date=1998 |title=Director's Commentary (Fried Green Tomatoes) |medium=[[DVD]] |language=English |location=United States |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Video]] |oclc=861743569}}</ref> He was introduced to it by producer Lisa Lindstrom, with whom he worked on television films ''Heat Wave'' and ''Breaking Point''.

Although she had some screenwriting experience, she found the process of turning her own novel into a script a strange one. The job was made somewhat easier by the work done by Sobieski and Avnet in choosing which characters from the book were going to be featured, but she found it difficult and also left the project, after writing 70 pages of the screenplay. With no money left to hire another writer, Avnet took the script over himself and spent the next 2\u20133 years developing it.
