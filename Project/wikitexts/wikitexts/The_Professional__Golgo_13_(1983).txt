It is the first animated film based on the manga, and the third overall ''Golgo 13'' film after two previous live-action films (the [[Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon|second film]] starring [[Sonny Chiba]] as Golgo 13).\n\nUpon its original Japanese theatrical release, ''Golgo 13: The Professional'' was the first feature-length [[animated film]] to incorporate [[CGI animation]], used in a helicopter action sequence. The film was later released in North America by [[Streamline Pictures]] in 1992. The Streamline release received mixed reviews from American critics at the time, with praise for the animation design but criticism towards the story, dubbing and adult content.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessional contract killer Duke Togo\u2014codenamed \"Golgo 13\"\u2014is hired to assassinate Robert Dawson, the son of oil baron Leonard Dawson and the heir of Dawson Enterprises, and succeeds. Later, after accomplishing a hit on a powerful crime boss in [[Sicily]] named Dr. Z, Golgo is suddenly attacked by the U.S. Military and CIA. His local contact, a clockmaker, is also murdered by a genetically enhanced supersoldier named Snake. Aided by [[the Pentagon]], the [[FBI]], and the [[CIA]], Dawson has become determined to kill Golgo and avenge his son's death.\n\nA military force, led by Lieutenant Bob Bragan, attempts to ambush Golgo while he is in the middle of an assignment from a wealthy [[Holocaust]] survivor in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to assassinate an ex-Nazi official. The plan fails, and Bragan's entire force is wiped out. However, a dying Bragan manages to wound Golgo. Meanwhile, Rita, the mechanic that supplied Golgo with his getaway car, is murdered by Snake.\n\nHaving been consumed by revenge, Dawson begins to allow the rest of his family to be harmed. To secure Snake's cooperation, he allows him to rape Robert's widow, Laura. Dawson also sends his granddaughter, Emily, and butler, Albert, to an airport to murder Golgo with a firearm concealed in a doll. The shot misses, and Albert reaches for his handgun. Golgo shoots Albert in the chest, a crowd gathers, and Golgo walks away nonchalantly.\n\nDawson, in a meeting with the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon, demands the release of Gold and Silver, two notorious murderers who were part of a covert government operation to test the survival rate of mercenaries in the jungles of South America. When the group refuses his request because Gold and Silver are on death row, Dawson threatens to halt all operations that his company controls, which include oil refineries and banks. The group acquiesces to his demands in fear that the economy of the country will collapse. When Laura demands to know why Dawson has refused to seek vengeance on whoever ordered the hit on Robert, he refuses to answer.\n\nPablo, an informant for Golgo, informs him that Dawson ordered the hit on him, and that he's currently in Dawson's tower awaiting his advance. Pablo goes on to inform Golgo that his wife and children are being kept at ransom in the tower. Pablo attempts to shoot Golgo, but is killed by Golgo first.\n\nGolgo arrives at Dawson Tower in [[New York City]], and begins his ascent to the top floor on foot. He first plays a game of cat and mouse with a fleet of helicopter gunships sent to kill him. While on the move, Golgo is attacked by Snake, and a brutal knifefight occurs between the two in an elevator, during which Snake manages to stab Golgo. A [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|Bell AH-1]] attack helicopter shoots the elevator, killing Snake while Golgo hides by the edge unseen by the helicopter. Gold and Silver are then sent to ambush Golgo. During the attack, Golgo counters both of them. As Gold reopens one of Golgo's prior stab wounds, Golgo bludgeons Gold on the head repeatedly with the butt of his revolver and shoots him. Silver, blinded by rage at his partner's death, rushes at Golgo, who quickly stuffs a grenade in Silver's mouth, which kills him. Golgo then proceeds towards Dawson.\n\nAdmitting failure, Dawson orders all action against Golgo to end. Golgo finally encounters Dawson at the top of his building. Following a brief monologue, Dawson attempts suicide by leaping out of the window. As he falls, Dawson remembers Robert's [[suicide note]], which reveals that, despite receiving much care from his father throughout his lifetime, Robert was overcome with grief over the possibility that he would never fulfill his father's ambitions; unable to commit suicide, he requested that Golgo kill him. Before Dawson hits the ground, Golgo shoots him in the head. Dawson falls headfirst, crushing his skull and any evidence that he was shot. His death is ruled as accidental by the authorities.\n\nAfterwards, Golgo encounters Laura, who has since become a [[prostitute]]. Trying to get the attention of men as they pass her by, she grabs a man's arm; when he turns to face her, she is stunned upon recognizing him. She eventually draws a pistol and aims it at Golgo, but when she hesitates to fire, he turns his back to her and walks away. Laura finally proceeds to shoot; the shot rings out and the scene fades. Golgo walks away into the night before the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! Japanese !! English<br>{{small|([[Streamline Pictures]], 1992)}}\n|-\n!
