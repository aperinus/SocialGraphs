The film stars [[Glen Hansard]] and [[Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1]] as two struggling musicians in [[Dublin]], Ireland. Hansard and Irglov\u00e1 had previously performed music as the [[The Swell Season|Swell Season]], and composed and performed the film's original songs.\n\n''Once'' spent years in development with the [[Irish Film Board]] and was made for a budget of \u20ac112,000. It was a commercial success, earning substantial per-screen box office averages in the United States, and received acclaim from critics. It received awards including the 2007 [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film]]. Hansard and Irglov\u00e1's song \"[[Falling Slowly]]\" won the 2008 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and the soundtrack received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination. The film has also been adapted into a successful [[Once (musical)|stage musical]].\n\n==Plot==\nA thirty-something [[busker]] (Guy) performs with his guitar on [[Grafton Street]], [[Dublin]] only for his performance to be interrupted when he chases a [[Drug addict|man]] who steals his money. Lured by his music, a young [[Czechs|Czech]] flower seller (Girl) talks to him about his songs. Delighted to learn that he repairs [[Vacuum cleaner|hoovers]], Girl asks Guy to fix hers. The next day Girl returns with her broken vacuum and tells him she is also a musician.\n\nAt a music store where Girl usually plays [[piano]], Guy teaches her one of his songs (\"[[Falling Slowly]]\"); they sing and play together. He invites her to his father's shop, and on the bus home musically answers Girl's question about what his songs are about: a long-time girlfriend who cheated on him, then left (\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\").\n\nAt the shop, Guy introduces Girl to his father and takes her to his room, but when he asks her to stay the night, she gets upset and leaves. The next day, they reconcile and spend the week writing, rehearsing and recording songs. Girl writes the lyrics for one of Guy's songs (\"If You Want Me\"), singing to herself while walking down the street; at a party, people perform impromptu (including \"Gold\").\n\nGuy works on \"Lies\", a song about his ex-girlfriend, who moved to London. Girl encourages him to win her back. Invited to her home, he discovers she has a toddler and lives with her mother. Guy decides to move to London, but he wants to record a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of his songs to take with him and asks Girl to record it with him. They secure a [[bank loan]] and reserve time at a [[recording studio]].\n\nGuy learns Girl has a husband in the [[Czech Republic]]. When he asks if she still loves her husband, Girl answers in [[Czech language|Czech]], \"''Miluji tebe''\" (\"I love you\"),<ref>{{cite web|author=Cival |url=http://film.moviezone.cz/once/recenze |title=Once (2006) |publisher=Film.moviezone.cz |access-date=2012-12-20}}</ref> but coyly declines to translate. After recruiting a band with other buskers, they go into the studio to record. They impress Eamon, the jaded studio engineer, with their first song (\"When Your Mind's Made Up\"). On a break in the early morning, Girl finds a piano in an empty studio and plays Guy one of her own compositions (\"The Hill\").\n\nAfter the all-night session wraps up, they walk home. Before they part ways, Girl reveals that she spoke to her husband and he is coming to live with her in Dublin. Guy persuades her to spend his last night in Dublin with him, but she stands him up and he cannot find her to say goodbye before his flight. He plays the demo for his father, who gives him money to help him get settled in London. Before leaving for the airport, Guy buys Girl a piano and makes arrangements for its delivery, then calls his ex-girlfriend, who is happy about his imminent arrival. Girl reunites with her husband in Dublin and plays the piano in their home.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Glen marketa derry 2006.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Once'' stars Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Glen Hansard]] as Guy\n* [[Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1]] as Girl \n* Hugh Walsh as Timmy Drummer\n* Gerard Hendrick as Lead Guitarist \n* Alaistair Foley as Bassist\n* Geoff Minogue as Eamon\n* Bill Hodnett as Guy's Dad\n* Danuse Ktrestova as Girl's Mother\n* Darren Healy as Heroin Addict\n* Mal Whyte as Bill\n* Marcella Plunkett as Ex-girlfriend\n* Niall Cleary as Bob\n* Wiltold Owski as Man watching TV\n* Krzysztos Tlotka as Man watching TV\n* Tomek Glowacki as Man watching TV\n* Keith Byrne as Guy in Piano Shop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Grafton St, Dublin.jpg|thumb|300px|Hansard's busking scenes were filmed on [[Grafton Street (Dublin)|Grafton Street]].]]\nThe two leads, Hansard and Irglov\u00e1, are professional musicians.<ref name=\"NY Times\">Scott, A.
