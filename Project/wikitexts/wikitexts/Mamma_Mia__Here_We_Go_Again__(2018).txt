Here We Go Again''''' is a 2018 British-American [[jukebox musical]] [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Ol Parker]], from a story by Parker, [[Catherine Johnson (playwright)|Catherine Johnson]], and [[Richard Curtis]]. It is the sequel to the 2008 film ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'', which in turn is based on the 1999 [[Mamma Mia! (musical)|musical of the same name]] using the music of [[ABBA]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Jeremy Irvine]], [[Josh Dylan]], [[Hugh Skinner]], [[Lily James]], [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]], [[Alexa Davies]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Cher]]. Both a [[prequel]] and a [[sequel]], the plot is set after the events of the previous film, and is intersected with flashbacks to Donna's youth in 1979, with some scenes from the two time periods mirroring each other.\n\nDue to the financial success of the first film, [[Universal Pictures]] had long been interested in a sequel. The film was officially announced in May 2017, with Parker hired to write and direct. In June 2017, many of the original cast confirmed their involvement, with James being cast in the role of Young Donna that July. Filming took place from August to December 2017 in [[Croatia]] (most prominently [[Vis (island)|Vis]]), [[Bordeaux]], [[Stockholm]], [[Oxford]], [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] and at [[Shepperton Studios]]. A [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] joint venture, the film was co-produced by [[Playtone]], Littlestar Productions and [[Legendary Entertainment]].\n\n''Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again'' was premiered at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in [[London]] on July 16, 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on July 20, 2018, ten years to the week after its predecessor's release, in both standard and [[IMAX]] formats.<ref name=\"IMAX\">{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|title=Imax Kicks Off Biggest Global Campaign Ever In 77 Countries: \"Films To The Fullest\"|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/imax-new-global-brand-campaign-films-to-the-fullest-1202433962/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 26, 2018 |access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref> The film was a box office success, grossing $402 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, as an improvement over its predecessor with critics praising the performances and musical numbers.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ellis|last=Clopton|title='Mamma Mia!

Donna's mother, Ruby, is a famous singer, but she has a strained relationship with her daughter and is consistently away on tour, and does not attend the graduation. Fed up with her mother's constant negligence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna decided to travel to Kalokairi to find her destiny.\n\nIn the present, five years after the [[Mamma Mia! (film)|events of the first film]], Sophie is in Kalokairi preparing for the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna, in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill are unable to attend due to overseas business ventures and Sophie also feels estranged from Sky, who's been offered a permanent job in [[New York City|New York]] (\"[[One of Us (ABBA song)|One of Us]]\").\n\nIn [[Paris]], Donna meets the sweet but awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her (\"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves soon after for Greece. She misses her boat to Kalokairi but is offered a ride by Bill Anderson in his yacht, and the two dance and flirt (\"[[Why Did It Have to Be Me?]]\"). On the way, they help a stranded fisherman, Alexio, back to shore in time to save the love of his life from having to marry another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece; however, he arrives too late and sadly watches the boat sailing off in the distance.\n\nIn the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive to support Sophie, and she shows them the new hotel (\"[[I Have a Dream (song)|I Have a Dream]]\"). This mirrors the past, in which Donna explores an abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm destroys the decorations and prevents transportation to Kalokairi, much to Sophie's dismay.\n\nSam, who has been living in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never let her mother down, telling her the story of how he once let Donna down. Years ago, before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance (\"[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name of the Game]]\"), but it ended badly when Donna found out Sam was engaged to another woman, Lorraine. Heartbroken, Donna breaks up with him and tearfully watches him leave the island (\"[[Knowing Me, Knowing You]]\"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie of her mother's value for her.\n\nFollowing Sam's departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by singing with her as Donna and the Dynamos (\"[[Mamma Mia (ABBA song)|Mamma Mia]]\"). Bill returns to the island, and Donna joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie who falls for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear that she is with another man. Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill's great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse Donna has been staying in. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she eventually gives birth to Sophie.\n\nIn the present, Sophie opens up to Rosie and Tanya about her conflict with Sky and Rosie explains to Sophie how she and Bill broke up (\"[[Angeleyes|Angel Eyes]]\"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. However, a much older Alexio recognises Bill and offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for saving his relationship. Bill convinces the others to join them for a party on Kalokairi. When the guests arrive (\"[[Dancing Queen]]\"), Bill and Rosie quickly reunite over their mutual grief over Donna's death, and Sophie reveals to Sky that she is pregnant, and she has never felt closer to her mother.\n\nThe celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite Sophie having decided to not invite her. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down in New York, and she wants to build a true relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honor of Donna (\"[[I've Been Waiting for You (ABBA song)|I've Been Waiting for You]]\"), much to the pride of Ruby, who expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter's death. It is then revealed that the hotel manager, Se\u00f1or Fernando Cienfuegos, is actually Ruby's long-lost lover from 1959, and the two are joyously reunited (\"[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]\").\n\nNine months later, Sophie has given birth to a baby boy, named Donny. At the christening, Donna's ghost proudly watches over her daughter as the two of them have one final moment before Donna fully passes on (\"[[My Love, My Life]]\"). The end credits show all the characters, including Donna and the younger cast, at a huge party at Hotel Bella Donna (\"[[Super Trouper (song)|Super Trouper]]\").\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Alexa Davies, Lily James, Jessica Keenan Wynn on MTV International.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Alexa Davies]], [[Lily James]], [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]], on [[MTV International]] in 2018]]\n[[File:Hugh Skinner, Jeremy Irvine, Josh Dylan on MTV International.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Hugh Skinner]], [[Jeremy Irvine]], [[Josh Dylan]], on [[MTV International]] in 2018]]\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Sophie Sheridan, Donna's daughter, Ruby's granddaughter, Sam's stepdaughter, Sky's wife, and Donny's mother.\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Donna Sheridan-Carmichael, founder of Donna and the Dynamos, Sophie's late mother, Ruby's late daughter, Sam's late wife, Sky's late mother-in-law, Donny's late grandmother and best friend of Tanya & Rosie.\n** [[Lily James]] as Young Donna.\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Sky Ramand, Sophie's husband, Donna and Sam's son-in-law, and Donny's father.\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Tanya Chesham-Leigh, one of Donna's best friends and former bandmates in Donna and the Dynamos; a rich three-time divorcee.\n** [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]] as Young Tanya.\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Rosie Mulligan, one of Donna's best friends and former bandmates in Donna and the Dynamos; a fun-loving author in a relationship with Bill.\n** [[Alexa Davies]] as Young Rosie.\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Sam Carmichael, an architect, Sophie's stepfather, Ruby's son-in-law, Sky's father-in-law, Donna's widower, and Donny's grandfather.\n** [[Jeremy Irvine]] as Young Sam.\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Harry Bright, a British businessman.\n** [[Hugh Skinner]] as Young Harry.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Bill Anderson, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] sailor and travel writer, Sofia's great-nephew and Lazaros's cousin.
