His wealthy brother, Josh, refers him for a job as a [[pharmaceutical sales representative]].\n\nAfter attending a [[Pfizer]] training program, Jamie goes to work for them, attempting to get doctors to prescribe [[Zoloft]]. He is rebuffed, much to the dismay of his regional manager, Bruce, who sees him as his ticket to the [[Chicago]] market. Bruce suggests he get Dr. Stan Knight to prescribe Zoloft instead of [[Prozac]], so other doctors will follow. Jamie tries to gain access to Dr. Knight by flirting with his female employees, while secretly discarding the Prozac samples.\n\nKnight eventually allows Jamie to observe him examine one of his patients, Maggie Murdock, who suffers from early onset [[Parkinson's disease]]. Taking an interest in Maggie, Jamie obtains her number from one of Knight's assistants whom he previously seduced.\n\nJamie and Maggie go on a date and agree that neither is interested in a serious relationship, so they start having [[casual sex]]. He is beaten up by top-selling Prozac rep, Trey Hannigan, who discovers that Jamie has been discarding his samples. Maggie reveals Trey is an ex-boyfriend and she tells Jamie a rumor about Jamie's company developing a new drug to treat [[erectile dysfunction]]. Bruce confirms that [[Viagra]] is about to be marketed.\n\nJamie starts selling Viagra which is an instant success. He reveals that he wants a serious relationship, but Maggie breaks up with him. He confronts her while she helps senior citizens onto a bus bound for [[Canada]] to [[Medical tourism|obtain cheap prescription drugs]]. They argue, Jamie refuses to leave and waits for Maggie all night at a bus stop. Touched, she reciprocates feelings and they resume their relationship.\n\nMaggie accompanies Jamie to a medical conference where she ends up at a Parkinson's [[support group]] across the street. She invites Jamie and he meets a man whose wife is in the final stages of the disease, and asks for advice. The man tells him to leave her, citing the downsides of the disease over time. After the convention, Maggie tells Jamie how much she loves him. He begins researching Parkinson's, and takes Maggie to different specialists around the country for tests. Jamie becomes angry when they arrive at an appointment only to discover it has been rescheduled. Feeling Jamie only wants to be with her if there is a hope for a cure, she breaks up with him.\n\nSome time later, Jamie and Josh are invited to a party by Knight, where Jamie takes Viagra and has a [[threesome]] with two women. He awakens with a rare [[side-effect]] and goes to the hospital. Some time later, he goes to a restaurant and encounters Maggie on a date. Bruce arrives and reveals Jamie has been promoted to the Chicago office.\n\nWhile packing, Jamie finds the [[videotape recorder]] with the video of himself and Maggie talking about life. He realizes he wants to be with her, but her boss tells him she has left for [[Canada]] to obtain cheap prescription drugs. Jamie finds and tells her that he loves and needs her. She starts to cry, saying she will need him more. Jamie decides not to take the job in Chicago; instead, he attends [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|medical school]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] to be with her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Jamie Randall\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Maggie Murdock\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Bruce Winston\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Dr. Stan Knight\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Josh Randall\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Trey Hannigan\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Cindy\n* [[George Segal]] as Dr. James Randall\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Nancy Randall\n* [[Nikki DeLoach]] as Christy\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as Lisa\n* [[Natalie Gold]] as Dr. Helen Randall \n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Jerry\n* [[Michael Buffer]] as Pfizer Convention MC \n* [[Bingo O'Malley]] as Sam \n* [[Jaimie Alexander]] as Carol (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe film was a posthumous release for Jill Clayburgh who died November 5, 2010.
