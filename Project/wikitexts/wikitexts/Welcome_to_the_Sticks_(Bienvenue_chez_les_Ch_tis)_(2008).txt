The film was the highest-grossing French film of all time at the [[box office]] in France<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2019-01-09|title=France All Time Opening Weekends|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/france/opening/?sort=gross&order=DESC&p=.htm|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> until it was surpassed by ''[[The Intouchables]]'' (2011).\n\n==Plot==\nPhilippe Abrams is the manager of the French [[post office]] (''[[La Poste (France)|La Poste]]'') branch in [[Salon-de-Provence]], [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], in southern France. He is married to Julie, whose negative character makes his life miserable. Philippe does everything to get a job at an office on the Mediterranean coast to make her happy. As it is perceived that the position will be acquired more easily if one is disabled, Abrams pretends that he is disabled \u2013 and is found out by the management. As punishment, he is banished for two years to [[Bergues]], a town near [[Dunkirk]] in northern [[France]]. Northern France \u2013 and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region in particular \u2013 is considered [[boondocks|\"the sticks\"]] \u2013 a cold and rainy place inhabited by unsophisticated ''ch'tis'' who speak a strange dialect (called \"[[Picard language|''ch'ti'']]{{-\"}} in local parlance, and \"''cheutimi''{{-\"}} in the South). He has to spend his first night at the home of Antoine, a member of his staff. Philippe initially dislikes Antoine for his obnoxious behavior and because he initially thinks Antoine is gay (due to seeing pictures of him crossdressing), but later he that he worked for a carnival for time (where he did impressions of numerous people, men and women alike) and that he secretly has a crush on Annabelle, one of the workers at the post office. Antoine and Philippe subsequently become best friends.\n\nTo Philippe's surprise, Bergues proves to be a charming place teeming with warm, friendly people and co-workers. Soon, he is completely won over, eating strong-smelling [[Maroilles (cheese)|Maroilles cheese]]; talking to virtually every local (by delivering their mail, and accepting the recipients' invitation for a drink); playing at the beach; playing the [[carillon]] at the [[bell tower]] together, drinking beer like a local, going to an [[RC Lens]] football match and so forth. He tries to describe the happy turn of events to his wife who has remained in the South with their young son, but she does not believe him. This inspires Philippe to tell her what she wants to believe; that his life is wretched there.\n\nEverything goes fine until Julie decides to join him in the North to relieve his gloom. Philippe is forced to confess to his new friends and colleagues that he has described them as barbarians to his wife. First, they are angry, but they then decide to help him by behaving as such to cover for his lies and to scare Julie so she will depart quickly. They also let her stay in the old mining village near Bergues, pretending it is the main town. Julie has a very bad weekend, but decides she will move to Bergues to stay with Philippe, to be supportive.\n\nJust when she's ready to go back south, she discovers that she has been tricked when a local tells Julie that the actual town of Bergues is several kilometers away. When Philippe finds Julie at his real Bergues home, he tells her the truth about the happiness and friendship that the town has brought him. Julie is disappointed at first, but after realising her husband is happy, she decides to move north to be with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Antoine and Annabelle had been dating for over a year, but had broken up due to Antoine's passiveness towards his overbearing mother. Despite their split, Antoine still has feelings for Annabelle, who now has a new boyfriend. Upon learning this, Antoine cheers himself up by drinking alcohol during his work hours and behaves in an erratic manner. When Philippe urges Antoine to take courage and be [[assertiveness|assertive]], Antoine finally confesses to his mother that he loves Annabelle and is planning to move to a new place with her. Unexpectedly, his mother is happy about it \u2013 she has waited all these years for Antoine to stand up for himself. As a result, Antoine proposes to Annabelle by the bell tower when it is playing [[I Just Called to Say I Love You|a Stevie Wonder song]]. Annabelle accepts, and they get married.\n\nThree years later, Philippe receives a transfer to move south. Accepting the offer, Philippe and his family move south. Just as he is about to say goodbye, he is reduced to tears, proving Antoine's theory on the Ch'tis proverb (\"A visitor brays [cries] twice up north; once on his arrival and once at his departure\").\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Dany Boon Postier.JPG|thumb|Dany Boon during the filming in Bergues]]\n* [[Kad Merad]] as Philippe Abrams, Head of the local post office\n* [[Dany Boon]] as Antoine Bailleul, postman and [[carillon]] performer\n* [[Zo\u00e9 F\u00e9lix]] as Julie, spouse of Philippe Abrams\n* Lorenzo Ausilia-Foret as Rapha\u00ebl Abrams\n* [[Anne Marivin]] as Annabelle Deconninck\n* [[Philippe Duquesne]] as Fabrice Canoli\n* [[Guy Lecluyse]] as Yann Vandernoout\n* [[Patrick Bosso]] as Policeman on A7\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as Momo\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Commandeur]] as Inspector Lebic\n* [[Line Renaud]] as Antoine's mother\n* [[Michel Galabru]] as Julie's uncle\n* [[St\u00e9phane Freiss]] as Jean\n* Alexandre Carri\u00e8re as Tony\n* Jenny Cl\u00e8ve as The old lady who sings the [[P'tit Quinquin (song)|P'tit quinquin]] (Northern French hymn)\n* Fred Personne as M.
