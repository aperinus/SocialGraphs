The film stars [[Sean Connery]], [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Lesley-Anne Down]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1855<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-great-train-robbery-1979|website=rogerebert.com/|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> Edward Pierce (Sean Connery), seemingly a charismatic member of [[London]]'s high society, is secretly a master thief. He plans to steal a monthly shipment of gold from the London to [[Folkestone]] train which is meant as payment for British troops fighting in the [[Crimean War]]. The gold is heavily guarded in two [[Chubbsafes|heavy safes]] in the [[baggage car]], each of which has two locks, requiring a total of four keys. Pierce recruits Robert Agar (Donald Sutherland), a [[Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] and [[Safe-cracking|screwsman]]. Pierce's mistress Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down) and his [[chauffeur]] Barlow (George Downing) join the plot, and a train guard, Burgess, is bribed into participation. The executives of the bank who arrange the gold transport, the manager Mr. Henry Fowler ([[Malcolm Terris]]) and the president Mr. Edgar Trent ([[Alan Webb (actor)|Alan Webb]]), each possess a key; the other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] at the [[London Bridge station|London Bridge railway station]]. In order to hide the robbers' intentions, wax impressions are to be made of each of the keys.\n\nPierce ingratiates himself with Trent by feigning a shared interest in [[Rat-baiting|ratting]]. He also begins courting Trent's [[spinster]] daughter, Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd), and learns from her the location of her father's key. Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home at night, manage to locate the hidden key and make a wax impression before making a clean getaway despite a close call with the butler.\n\nPierce targets Fowler through his weakness for [[Prostitution in the United Kingdom|prostitutes]]. Miriam reluctantly poses as \"Madame Lucienne\", a high-class [[courtesan]] in an exclusive [[bordello]]. Miriam meets with Fowler and asks him to undress, forcing him to remove the key worn round his neck. While Fowler is distracted by Miriam, Agar makes an impression of his key. Pierce then stages a phony [[police raid]] to rescue Miriam, forcing Fowler to flee to avoid a scandal.\n\nThe keys at the train station prove a much harder challenge. After a daytime diversionary tactic with a child pickpocket fails because Agar cannot wax them in the time available, Pierce decides to \"crack the crib\" at night. The whole operation is a matter of timing, because the officer guarding the railway office at night leaves his post only once, for seventy-five seconds (to go to the toilet). Pierce plans to use \"snakesman\" (cat burglar) Clean Willy ([[Wayne Sleep]]) to climb the station's wall, climb down into the station, enter the office via a small skylight in the office ceiling, and open the office door and the key cabinet from within. Because Clean Willy is incarcerated at [[Newgate Prison]], Pierce and Agar first have to arrange for him to break out, using a public execution as a distraction. With Willy's help, the criminals succeed in making wax impressions of the keys without detection.\n\nClean Willy is subsequently arrested after being caught pick-pocketing and informs on Pierce. The police use Willy to lure Pierce into a trap, but the master cracksman easily eludes capture. Clean Willy escapes from his captors, but is murdered by Barlow on Pierce's orders. The authorities, now aware that a robbery is imminent, increase security by having the baggage car padlocked from the outside until the train arrives at its destination and forbidding anyone but the guard to travel in the baggage van. Any container large enough to hold a man must be opened and inspected before it is loaded on the train.\n\nPierce smuggles Agar into the baggage car disguised as a corpse in a coffin.  Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way, but he and Miriam encounter Fowler, who is riding the train to Folkestone to accompany the shipment. After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention, Pierce travels down the roof of the train and unlocks the baggage van's door from the outside.  He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point. However, soot from the engine's smoke has stained Pierce's skin and clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar's suit, which is much too small for him. The jacket splits across the back when he disembarks at Folkestone. The police quickly become suspicious and arrest him before he can rejoin his accomplices.\n\nPierce is put on trial for the robbery. As he exits the courthouse, he receives the adulation of the crowds, who consider him a [[folk hero]] for his daring act. In the commotion, a disguised Miriam kisses him full on the mouth, in the process slipping a key to his handcuffs from her mouth to his. Agar is also present, disguised as a [[police van]] driver. As Pierce is about to be put into the wagon, he frees himself and he and Agar escape, to the jubilation of the crowd and the chagrin of the police.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Edward Pierce\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Agar\n* [[Lesley-Anne Down]] as Miriam\n* [[Alan Webb (actor)|Alan Webb]] as Trent\n* [[Malcolm Terris]] as Henry Fowler\n* [[Robert Lang (actor)|Robert Lang]] as Sharp\n* [[Michael Elphick]] as Burgess\n* [[Wayne Sleep]] as Clean Willy\n* [[Pamela Salem]] as Emily Trent\n* Gabrielle Lloyd as Elizabeth Trent\n* George Downing as Barlow\n* [[James Cossins]] as Harranby\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Judge\n* [[Peter Benson (actor)|Peter Benson]] as Station Master\n* [[Janine Duvitski]] as Maggie\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] as Putnam\n* Geoffrey Ferris as Pickpocket \n}}\n\n== Production ==\nFilm rights to the novel were bought in 1975 by [[Dino de Laurentiis]].<ref name=thomas>{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Bob|title=Movies: Director Dino hits the shores of America|work=Chicago Tribune|date=21 September 1975|page=e16}}</ref> In 1977 it was announced the film would be made in Ireland by [[American International Pictures]] with [[Sean Connery]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]].<ref name=fitz>{{cite news|last1=Fitzsimons|first1=Godfrey|title=Hollywood company to make $5m. film here|work=The Irish Times|date=10 June 1977|page=13}}</ref>\n\nCrichton deliberately varied the film from his book.

Connery was told that the train would travel at only 20 miles per hour during his time on top of the cars. However, the train crew used an inaccurate means of judging the train's speed. The train was actually doing speeds of 40 to 50 miles per hour. Connery wore soft rubber soled shoes and the roofs of the carriages were covered with a sandy, gritty surface. Connery actually slipped and nearly fell off the train during one jump between two carriages, and had difficulty keeping his eyes free of smoke and cinders from the locomotive.<ref name=bray>{{cite book|last1=Bray|first1=Christopher|title=Sean Connery: A Biography|date=2011|publisher=Pegasus|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4532-1770-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Heuston railway station|Heuston Station]] in [[Dublin]] stood in for 'London Bridge Station' in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McCormack|first=Stan|date=2020-08-13|title=When the movies came to town|url=https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2020/08/13/when-the-movies-came-to-town/|access-date=2022-07-19|website=[[Westmeath Examiner]]|language=en}}</ref> During the filming at the station, a diesel locomotive leaked a large quantity of fuel onto the tracks by the platform.

The robbery was a year in the planning and involved making sets of duplicate keys from [[wax]] impressions for the locks on the safes, and bribing the train's guard, a man called Burgess.<ref name=chesney>{{cite book|last1=Chesney|first1=Kellow|title=The Victorian Underworld.|date=1970|publisher=Maurice Temple Smith Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-85117-002-1|author-link1=Kellow Chesney}}</ref>{{rp|210}} Crichton, the author of the book and the screenplay, was inspired by Kellow Chesney's 1970 book ''The Victorian Underworld'', which is a comprehensive examination of the more sordid aspects of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society.\n\nIn his screenplay Crichton based his character \"Clean Willy\" Williams on another real-life character from Chesney's book, a [[burglar|housebreaker]] named Williams (or Whitehead) who, sentenced to death in [[Newgate Prison]], escaped from prison by climbing the 15-metre (50-ft.) tall sheer [[granite]] walls, squeezing through the revolving iron spikes at the top, and climbing over the inward projecting sharp spikes above them before making his escape over the roofs.{{r|chesney|page1=187}} The only completely fictional character in the film is Miriam ([[Lesley-Anne Down]]).\n\nThe film also draws loose parallels to the [[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|1903 film of the same name]]. The 1903 film has just 18 shots, but the film borrows two scenes, one in which Pierce (the 1903 characters are unnamed) is on top of the train, and another when a person is thrown off the moving train.\n\n=== Filming locations ===\nAlthough set in [[London]] and [[Kent]], most of the filming took place in [[Ireland]]. In particular, the final scenes were filmed in [[Trinity College, Dublin]]<ref>{{cite web |author=David Ingoldsby |title=The Great Train Robbery (1978) |work=Shot at Trinity |publisher=Trinity College Dublin |url=http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?post_type=film&p=83 |access-date=20 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103842/http://www.tcd.ie/film/shotattrinity/?post_type=film&p=83 |archive-date=22 May 2015  }}</ref> and [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent railway station]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].

The scenes on the moving train were filmed on the [[Mullingar]] to [[Athlone]] railway line (now closed) at [[Castletown Geoghegan]] Station. The train driver was John Byrne from Mullingar, now deceased. [[Moate railway station]] is the location for Ashford station.\n\nThe two locomotives featured were both J-15 0-6-0s, No 184 of 1880, and No 186 of 1879.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.steamtrainsireland.com/rpsi-collection/10/no-184|title=No. 184|last=31interactive.co.uk|website=www.steamtrainsireland.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.steamtrainsireland.com/rpsi-collection/9/no-186|title=No. 186|last=31interactive.co.uk|website=www.steamtrainsireland.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film's soundtrack was written by [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. The score was his third collaboration with writer/director [[Michael Crichton]] following ''[[Pursuit (1972 telefilm)|Pursuit]]'' (1972) and ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'' (1978). The music for two pianos played by the characters Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd) and Emily Trent ([[Pamela Salem]]) is from the third movement of Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]] ''Molto Allegro''.\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Great Train Robbery'' has a critical rating of 74% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 27 reviews.<ref name=tom>{{cite web|title=The Great Train Robbery (1979)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1008865-great_train_robbery/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref> The site's critics praised the film's comedic tone, action sequences, and Victorian details.
