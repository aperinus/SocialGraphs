The film depicts [[Jackie Siegel]] and [[David A. Siegel|David Siegel]], owners of [[Westgate Resorts]], and their family as they build their private residence&nbsp;\u2013 [[Versailles house|Versailles]], one of the largest and most expensive single-family houses in the United States&nbsp;\u2013 and the crisis they face as the US economy declines.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[David A. Siegel|David Siegel]] is the wealthy owner of [[Westgate Resorts]], a [[timeshare]] company in [[Florida]]. His wife [[Jackie Siegel]], thirty years his junior, was the winner of the [[Mrs. Florida]] pageant in 1993.<ref>{{cite news| author =Guy Adams| title =David and Jackie Siegel: Meet the King and Queen of Versailles| quote =...&nbsp;Jackie, the 1993 winner of the Mrs Florida America beauty pageant&nbsp;...| newspaper =[[The Independent]]| date = August 15, 2012| url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/david-and-jackie-siegel-meet-the-king-and-queen-of-versailles-8046797.html| accessdate =  June 8, 2015}}</ref> They begin construction on the [[Versailles house]], a vast mansion named after the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Located on the outskirts of [[Orlando]], it would be one of the largest [[single-family detached home]]s in the United States if completed (the largest being [[North Carolina]]'s [[Biltmore Estate]] at 178,926 square feet).\n\nHowever, Siegel's company is badly affected by the [[Great Recession]] in 2008 and his family struggles to cope with their reduced income. Construction on the new house is halted, most of their servants are laid off, and their pets are neglected. David retreats into his office, determined to save his [[Las Vegas]] property venture, [[Elara (timeshare)|PH Towers]]. Jackie struggles to rein in her compulsive shopping habits. The children and their nanny are also interviewed. The film ends with none of their issues resolved.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was reviewed positively. The film-critics aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported 95 percent of critics gave a positive review, with an average score of 8/10 and the consensus, \"''The Queen of Versailles'' is a timely, engaging, and richly drawn portrait of the [[American Dream]] improbably composed of equal parts compassion and [[schadenfreude]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Queen of Versailles|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_queen_of_versailles/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[A.&nbsp;O. Scott]] called the film \"A gaudy guilty pleasure that is also a piece of trenchant social criticism\", and said, {{blockquote|the movie starts out in the mode of reality television, resembling the pilot for a new \"Real Housewives\" franchise or a reboot of \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.\" Before long, though, it takes on the coloration of a [[Theodore Dreiser]] novel&nbsp;\u2013 not quite an American tragedy but a sprawling, richly detailed study of ambition, desire and the wild swings of fortune that are included in the price of the capitalist ticket.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let them Eat Crow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/movies/review-the-queen-of-versailles-by-lauren-greenfield.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 19, 2012| first= A.

On March 13, 2014, he returned his ruling that the film was not defamatory. He elaborated, \"having viewed the supposedly egregious portions of the Motion Picture numerous times, [the arbitrator] simply does not find that any of the content of the Motion Picture was false.\" Furthermore, he wrote that \"There is nothing taken away by the viewer of the Motion Picture that is inconsistent with the fundamental reality that the global recession created a crisis for Westgate causing it to have to reluctantly give up its interest in PH Towers,\" and \"To a great extent this is derived from the words of David, Jackie, and Richard Siegel themselves. Perhaps the clearest example of this is David referring to the story being told as a 'rags-to-riches-to-rags story.'\" Lastly, Rifkin found that Westgate failed to show how it was damaged from the documentary, saying that the company \"did not remotely establish the type of malice required for a defamation claim on behalf of a public figure.\"<ref name=\"Eriq Gardner\">{{cite web |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title='Queen of Versailles' Filmmaker Beats Westgate's Defamation Claim (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/queen-versailles-filmmaker-beats-westgates-688730|first=Eriq | last=Gardner |date=2014-03-13}}</ref> He subsequently ordered David Siegel and Westgate Resorts to pay the filmmakers $750,000 for legal fees.<ref name=\"Eriq Gardner\"/><ref name=\"Adam Benzine\">{{cite web |publisher=RealScreen.com |title=IFTA backs filmmakers over \"Queens of Versailles\" complaint |url=http://realscreen.com/2014/03/17/ifta-backs-filmmakers-over-queens-of-versailles-complaint/|date=2014-03-17 | first= Adam | last= Benzine}}</ref>\n\nIn a separate arbitration, Greg Derin of the [[American Arbitration Association]] ruled on February 28, 2014, that the filmmakers' agreement with the family, pertaining to certain [[life rights]], was \"invalid and unenforceable\".
