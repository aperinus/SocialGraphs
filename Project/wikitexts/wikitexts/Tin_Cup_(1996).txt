Costner received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoy \"Tin Cup\" McAvoy is a former [[golf]] prodigy leading a generally aimless existence. He owns a ramshackle [[driving range]] in [[West Texas]], where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar and their friends. One day Dr. Molly Griswold, a clinical psychologist, arrives looking for a golf lesson. She has been dating David Simms, a top professional golfer who played with Roy in college. Roy soon becomes attracted to Molly.\n\nThe next day David Simms shows up at Roy's trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament. Roy thinks he is being invited to play, but Simms actually wants to hire him as a [[caddie]] (since Roy knows the course). During the round, Roy needles Simms about laying up instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard. A bet among the other players is made and Simms fires Roy after he makes the long shot.\n\nTo get even with Simms, Roy decides to try to qualify for the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. He makes a play for Molly who is already his therapist.\n\nIn the first qualifying round, with Romeo as his caddie, Roy's game is excellent but his head needs help. Roy insists on playing recklessly and he demands the driver instead of the safe play which is laying up. Roy and Romeo fight and Romeo quits. Amazingly, Roy still manages to advance to the final qualifying round.\n\nWithout Romeo, Roy barely succeeds at the sectional qualifying round, earning a spot in the U.S. Open. Romeo returns and helps Roy with some swing problems.\n\nOn the first day of the U.S Open, Roy, playing hungover, shoots a horrendous 83. Meanwhile, Molly sees Simms' unpleasant side and decides she truly wants to help Roy. With renewed confidence, McAvoy shocks the golf world by making the cut with a U.S. Open round record at 10 under par. Roy's third round is also excellent and moves him into contention.\n\nOn the last day of the U.S. Open tournament, Roy is in a three-way battle to win. For the fourth day in a row, Roy takes a shot that repeatedly fails to keep the ball out of the water hazard. On his twelfth and final shot, facing disqualification, he reaches the green and amazingly, it goes in the hole. Roy realizes that he has blown a shot at winning the U.S. Open, but Molly re-assures him about how people will always remember his amazing shot.\n\nBack in Texas, Molly tells Roy that he automatically qualified for next year's Open due to his standing. They kiss passionately as the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Roy \"Tin Cup\" McAvoy\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Dr. Molly Griswold\n* [[Don Johnson]] as David Simms\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Romeo Posar\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Dewey\n* [[Linda Hart]] as Doreen\n* [[Dennis Burkley]] as Earl\n* [[Lou Myers (actor)|Lou Myers]] as Clint\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Curt\n* [[George Perez (actor)|George Perez]] as Jose\n* [[Mickey Jones]] as Turk\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Boone\n* [[Jim Nantz]] as CBS announcer\n* [[Ken Venturi]] as CBS announcer\n\n''Tin Cup'' was based on a story by Ron Shelton and Tim Norville inspired by the vulgar expression, \"He's (She's) not worth a fart in a tin cup.\" It was scripted by Norville and received a rewrite from Shelton. Costner joined the project in June 1995, having previous worked with Shelton on ''[[Bull Durham]]''. Filming was due to start on September 15, 1995.<ref>{{cite web |date=5 June 1995 |author=Variety Staff |title=Costner is 'Tin's' man |url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/costner-is-tin-s-man-99127056/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Janine Turner]] was reportedly the first choice for the role of Molly Griswold, but she turned it down. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was also approached before [[Rene Russo]] was then cast.

[[John Leguizamo]] was offered the character of Romeo Posar until [[Cheech Marin]] stepped in to do the role.\n\n[[Kevin Costner]] trained extensively with [[Gary McCord]] to learn how to play golf, as stated in the foreword Costner wrote for McCord's book, ''Golf For Dummies''.
