Lee Thompson]] and starring [[Melissa Sue Anderson]] and [[Glenn Ford]]. Its plot revolves around six brutal murders occurring around a popular college senior's birthday. Filmed primarily in Canada and upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], ''Happy Birthday to Me'' was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], and released theatrically in North America on May 15, 1981. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] during the [[video nasty]] panic. The film received mostly mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nVirginia \"Ginny\" Wainwright is a pretty and popular high school senior at Crawford Academy, a member of the school's \"Top Ten,\" an elite clique of the most privileged and popular students. Each night, the group meets at the Silent Woman Tavern, a local pub. One night en route to the tavern, Bernadette O'Hara is attacked in her car by an unseen assailant. She struggles and plays dead to catch the killer off-guard before running to get help. She then runs into an unseen individual whom she is familiar with and begs for help, but the person slashes her neck with a straight razor.\n\nThe Top Ten becomes concerned when Bernadette fails to arrive at the pub. Upon leaving, the group sees the nearby drawbridge raising and decide to play a game of chicken. Ginny is pushed into a car by Ann Thomason, and each of the group attempt to cross the bridge as it raises; the car Ginny is in barely clears the bridge, crashing as it meets the other side. Distraught, Ginny runs home, stopping at her mother's grave in an adjacent cemetery. At her home, Etienne, a Top Ten member, breaks into Ginny's room and steals her underwear.\n\nBernadette fails to show up at school the following day. Ginny, who is plagued by repressed memories, visits her on-call psychiatrist, Dr. Faraday, with whom she previously underwent an experimental brain tissue restoration procedure after surviving a harrowing accident at the drawbridge. As Ginny attempts to resume her normal life, her fellow Top Ten members are murdered in vicious and violent ways: Etienne is strangled when his scarf gets thrown into the spokes of his motorcycle, and Greg's neck is crushed in his room while lifting weights. Ann and Ginny go to Alfred's house as he has been acting odd lately and discovers he is an elaborate prosthetic make up artist with a creepy replica of Bernadette's head\n\nOne night, Alfred, a Top Ten member who is infatuated with Ginny, follows her to her mother's grave. In retaliation, she stabs him with a pair of garden shears. On the weekend of Ginny's 18th birthday, her father leaves for a business trip. After a school dance, Ginny invites Steve to her house and prepares shish kebabs. While the two are drinking wine and smoking marijuana, Ginny begins to feed Steve with the kebab, but violently shoves the skewer down his throat.\n\nAnn arrives at Ginny's house the following morning and finds Ginny taking a shower. In the shower, Ginny has a flashback of her mother's death: Her mother, a newly-inducted socialite, invites the Top Ten to Ginny's birthday celebration four years earlier and is concerned when no guests have arrived. After questioned by her mother, Ginny tearfully mentions the group are attending a party Ann is having instead. Humiliated, her mother drives drunk to the Thomasons' house with Ginny, where she is denied entry by Mr. Thomason's gatekeeper. Enraged and upset, she attempts to drive across a raising drawbridge, causing their car to fall into the water. Pinned beneath the steering wheel, Ginny's mother drowns. Ginny, however, manages to swim to safety.\n\nParanoid that she may be murdering her friends during blackout episodes, Ginny visits Dr. Faraday. When she confronts him over the procedure she underwent, he is evasive, and she murders him with a fireplace poker. Mr. Wainright returns home during a thunderstorm for Ginny's birthday and finds a pool of blood in the foyer. He flees hysterically and finds one of Ginny's friends, Amelia, standing in the yard in what seems to be a state of shock, clutching a wrapped gift. In the cemetery, he discovers his late wife's grave to have been robbed, with Dr. Faraday's corpse lying in it.\n\nMr. Wainright notices a light on inside the family's guest cottage. Inside, he finds the bodies of each member of the Top Ten seated at a table alongside his dead wife's corpse. He then sees Ginny enter the room with a birthday cake, singing \"Happy Birthday\" to herself, seeming to have lost her mind. Feeling he has failed his daughter with her treatment, Ginny suddenly slashes her father's throat. He dies, failing to notice another girl is seated at the table with her head down. Ginny then goes toward the girl, who also appears to be Ginny. As the girl comes to the Ginny we have seen throughout the film, she begins to raise her voice saying she did it all for her, as she ruined her last party. Suddenly the two Ginnys struggle and the other girl is revealed as Ann, who has disguised herself as Ginny with an elaborate latex mask probably made by Alfred. Ann removes the mask, ranting and raving over her father's affair with Ginny's mother and how it destroyed her family. Ann reveals that she and Ginny are half-sisters and it's all her fault. Ginny manages to wrestle the knife from Ann and stabs her to death. As she stands over Ann's corpse holding the bloodied knife, a police officer enters the cottage and says, \"What have you done?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Melissa Sue Anderson]] as Virginia \"Ginny\" Wainwright\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as Dr. David Faraday\n* [[Lawrence Dane]] as Harold \"Hal\" Wainwright\n* [[Sharon Acker]] as Estelle Wainwright\n* [[Frances Hyland]] as Mrs. Patterson\n* [[Tracey E.

Dunning and Link would team up again on another Canadian slasher, ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981), which went into production within a week of ''Happy Birthday to Me'' wrapping; however, ''My Bloody Valentine'' was actually released first, rushed to meet a February 11, 1981 release date in time for Valentine's Day. Keen to get their classier, bigger-budgeted ''Happy Birthday to Me'' released, Dunning and Link quickly realized that gimmicks were being used up by other slasher movies in the wake of [[John Carpenter]]\u2019s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) and [[Sean S. Cunningham]]\u2019s ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980). 1980 alone saw the release of ''Friday the 13th'', as well as two New Year's Eve-themed horror movies, ''[[Terror Train]]'' (1980) and ''[[New Year's Evil (film)|New Year\u2019s Evil]]'' (1980), as well as Christmas-themed films ''[[To All a Goodnight]]'' (1980) and ''[[Christmas Evil]]'' (1980), the wedding-themed ''[[He Knows You're Alone|He Knows You\u2019re Alone]]'' (1980), ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980), and ''[[Mother's Day (1980 film)|Mother\u2019s Day]]'' (1980) (followed by ''[[Graduation Day (film)|Graduation Day]]'' and the Thanksgiving-based ''[[Home Sweet Home (1981 film)|Home Sweet Home]]'' the following year). Because everyone has a birthday, Dunning and Link believed that ''Happy Birthday to Me'' could have universal appeal. They hired John Saxton, a [[University of Toronto]] English professor, to develop the story. The [[subplot]] involving Virginia's [[brain injury]] came from Dunning reading an article about  [[regeneration (biology)|regenerating]] frogs with electricity; he figured this could form the basis for a murder mystery where a girl suffers [[flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|blackouts]] yet is unsure of her role in the mayhem around her.<ref name=\"ker\">{{cite web|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=Happy Birthday to Me (1981) Pre-Production|url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_to_Me/pre-production.htm|website=Hysteria Lives!|access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it seems to have been directly influenced by the success of ''Friday the 13th'' and ''Prom Night'', pre-production on ''Happy Birthday to Me'' had started before those films had been released, which more than hints that the huge success of ''Halloween'' was perhaps more of an influence (although the [[Grand Guignol]] elements of ''Friday the 13th'' may also have contributed).<ref name=\"ker\">{{cite web|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=Happy Birthday to Me (1981) Pre-Production|url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_to_Me/pre-production.htm|website=Hysteria Lives!|access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe specialized genre website ''[http://retroslashers.net Retro Slashers]'' has a copy of the script purporting to be a third draft from April 1980, where the major difference is that Virginia is actually the killer, possessed by the spirit of her deceased mother. Although this ending logistically makes more sense than the ending that was filmed, the filmmakers thought that what was originally scripted was not climactic enough. Still, the majority of the film does point to this original ending, which indicates the switch came well into production. This version of the script also features a good number of scenes that were either never shot or rewritten, including some that show more clearly Alfred's love for Virginia and Virginia's difficult relationship with her father.\n\n[[File:James at 15 Lance Kerwin Melissa Sue Anderson 1977.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Melissa Sue Anderson]], known for her role on the NBC series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', was cast as the film's lead character.]]\nThe script was completely reworked by screenwriting team Timothy Bond and Peter Jobin before production started.<ref name=\"ker\">{{cite web|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=Happy Birthday to Me (1981) Pre-Production|url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_to_Me/pre-production.htm|website=Hysteria Lives!|access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nActress Melissa Sue Anderson, who had garnered childhood fame for her portrayal of [[Mary Ingalls]] on the television series ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', was cast in the film's lead, marking her major feature debut.{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=107}} Lisa Langlois auditioned for the role of Ann, but the role went to Tracey Bregman instead.<ref name=bb>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/lisalanglois/|title=The Beauty & the Beasts: An Interview with Lisa Langlois|date= June 2011|work=The Terror Trap|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913013833/http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/lisalanglois/|archive-date=September 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Happy Birthday to Me'' began production in early July 1980. At the helm was the British director [[J. Lee Thompson]], famous for the classic ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962).{{sfn|Pitts|2014|p=97}} Thompson had also been a [[dialogue coach]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]] years before. Thompson had actively been looking to direct a thriller, and became attached to ''Happy Birthday to Me''. In the press pack he stated: \"What attracted me to this script was that the young people stood out as vivid, individual characters. The difference between a good chiller and exploitative junk, at least in my opinion, is whether or not you care about the victims\".<ref name=\"market\"/>\n\n[[Jack Blum]], who played Alfred in the film, said that Thompson took the film seriously. Thompson would later direct the [[Charles Bronson]] thriller ''[[10 to Midnight]]'' (1983), which featured more [[Exploitation film|exploitative]] material than ''Happy Birthday to Me''. Hollywood actor [[Glenn Ford]], who played [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in [[Richard Donner]]\u2019s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), was less-than-thrilled to be in a slasher film. Apparently Ford was unpleasant on the set.\n\nThe film's make-up effects were done by special effects guru Tom Burman (who replaced St\u00e9phan Dupuis just three weeks before the cameras were due to start rolling). Dupuis later did the duties on another bigger budget Canadian slasher, ''[[Visiting Hours (film)|Visiting Hours]]'' (1982), but left the production for undisclosed reasons. Ironically, in an issue of ''[[Fangoria]]'' from 1981, Burman criticizes the level of gore in films at that time.\n\n''Happy Birthday to Me'' finished filming in September 1980 (five months after the release of ''Friday the 13th''). Much of it was shot in and around [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College]] in [[Montreal]], while the drawbridge scenes were actually filmed in [[Phoenix, New York]], just outside [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]].<ref name=afi/> The producers found it difficult to find the right bridge closer to the main production, as the expansion of the Highway system had made them increasingly rare. The whole town of Phoenix came to watch the dangerous stunts, where a total of fifteen cars were junked, and one stunt driver was hospitalized with two broken ankles. The bridge itself has since been removed and replaced by a bridge further to the north.  Additional photography occurred on the campuses of [[Concordia University]] and [[McGill University]].<ref name=goldberg>{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Howard|series=In Progress|title=Happy Birthday to Me|journal=[[Cinema Canada]]|issn=0009-7071|pages=6\u20137|issue=68|date=September 1980}}</ref>\n\nDirector Thompson became known for tossing buckets of blood about on the set of the film to increase the on-screen gore; according to producer [[John Dunning (film producer)|John Dunning]], with the assistance of special effects man Tom Burman, Thompson \"would be splashing blood all over the place\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/johndunning/|title=R.S.V.P. or Die!: An Interview with John Dunning|date=March 2011|work=The Terror Trap|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203221939/http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/johndunning/|archive-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film's ending was changed to hide the fact that the script was being rewritten so late in production.\n\n[[Bo Harwood]] and Lance Rubin provided the film's score. [[Syreeta]], one-time wife of [[Stevie Wonder]], provided the eerie closing track, composed by Lance Rubin that plays over the credits.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=Happy Birthday to Me (1981) Production|url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_to_Me/production.htm|website=Hysteria Lives!|access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Promotion===\n[[Columbia Pictures]] bought the $2.5 million production for $3.5 million, following [[Paramount Pictures]]' lead with buying ''Friday the 13th'' the year before. Columbia reportedly put as much money into promoting the film as it cost to make. The promotional materials for the film boasted its numerous unusual death sequences as \"six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see\".<ref name=afi/> The theatrical poster featured sub-taglines reading: \"John will never eat shish kebab again\" and \"Steven will never ride a motorcycle again\", despite the fact that there is no character named \"John\" in the film, while Steven is the character who dies by a shish kekab; Etienne is the character who suffers a death via a motorcycle.<ref name=afi/><ref name=\"market\"/>\n\nDunning and Link didn't like the advertising campaign that Columbia Pictures had planned; they thought it should have been more subtle and worried that it might put off as many people as it attracted. They were concerned that only a handful of the murders in the film were truly bizarre and that the audience might feel cheated.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nColumbia Pictures really pushed the promotional manual for ''Happy Birthday to Me'', which was jam-packed with ideas for cinemas to promote the film. Although it is not clear how many picture houses really embraced the film's promotion, some of the more colorful ideas were to stage a mini-recreation of the film's final scene (without the bodies), but with a butchered birthday cake with crimson candles surrounded by glittering birthday party hats, all to be set upon a fake coffin. People celebrating their own birthdays were encouraged to bring family and friends with incentives, such as T-shirts and party hats. They also suggested having a member of staff, dressed in funereal black, preventing anyone from entering the auditorium during the final ten minutes. Those in line would then be offered \"''a bite-sized slice of Virginia's birthday cake''\" from the concession stand.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nThe promotion manual also had many ideas for [[Radio DJ|radio disc jockeys]] to promote the film, including a special 'scream in'. Callers would be asked questions such as, \"''How would you react if you went to a birthday party \u2026 and you were the only person at the dinner table who was still alive?''\" Those with the best set of lungs would win free passes to the film. The manual also encouraged the DJ's to attend dressed as funeral attendants and give each girl a white [[lily]] and each boy a blood-red [[carnation]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kerswell|first1=J.A.|title=Happy Birthday to Me (1981) Promotion|url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/Happy_Birthday_to_Me/promotion.htm|website=Hysteria Lives!}}</ref>\n\nThe film was also advertised with [[Film trailer|trailers]] both at the cinema and on TV.
