Danny caddies for Ty Webb, a mischievous but avid golfer and the son of one of Bushwood's co-founders. Danny tries to gain favor with Judge Elihu Smails, the country club's arrogant co-founder and director of the caddie scholarship program, by caddying for him. Meanwhile, Carl Spackler, a [[Mental disorder|mentally unstable]] [[greenskeeper]] who lives in the maintenance building, is sent by his Scottish supervisor Sandy McFiddish to hunt a [[gopher]] that Judge Smails saw damaging the course. He attempts to kill it with a rifle and high-pressure hose but fails.\n\nAl Czervik, a loud and free-spirited ''[[nouveau riche]]'' golfer and successful real estate developer, begins attending the club as a guest of member Drew Scott. Czervik distracts Smails as he tees off, causing his shot to go badly. Later, frustrated by slow play, Czervik wagers with Smails. Smails is furious for losing the bet and throws his putter, injuring an elderly woman. Danny takes the blame for the incident to gain Smails' favor. Smails encourages him to apply for the caddie scholarship.\n\nAt Bushwood's annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] banquet, Danny and his girlfriend Maggie work as [[waiting staff|wait staff]] under Lou Loomis. Czervik continues to annoy Smails and the older club members, while amusing and gaining favor with the younger club members, as well as the staff, to whom he consistently hands out generous amounts of cash as tips. Danny becomes attracted to Lacey Underall, Smails' promiscuous niece, who is visiting for the summer and frequents the club.\n\nLater, Danny wins the Caddy Day golf tournament and the scholarship, earning him an invitation from Smails to attend the christening ceremony for his boat at the nearby Rolling Lakes Yacht Club. Smails' boat is sunk at the event after an accident involving Czervik's larger boat. Returning home, Smails discovers Lacey and Danny in bed at his house. Expecting to be fired or to have the scholarship revoked, Danny is surprised when Smails only demands that he keeps the incident secret.\n\nUnable to bear the continued presence of the uncouth Czervik, Smails confronts him and announces that he will never be granted membership. Czervik counters by announcing that he would never consider being a member: he insults the country club and claims to be there merely to evaluate buying it and developing the land into condominiums. After a brief fight and exchange of insults, Webb suggests they discuss the situation over drinks. After Smails demands satisfaction, Czervik proposes a team golf match with Smails and his regular golfing partner Dr. Beeper against Czervik and Webb. Against club rules, they also agree to a $20,000 wager on the match, which quickly doubles to $40,000. That evening, Webb practices for the game against Smails and his errant shot brings him to meet Carl; the two share a bottle of wine and a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]].\n\nThe match is held the next day. Word spreads of the stakes involved, drawing in a crowd of club members and employees. During the game, Smails and Beeper take the lead, while Czervik, to his chagrin, is \"playing the worst game of his life;\" at the same time, Webb slowly cracks over his own awful game. Czervik reacts to Smails' taunts by angrily doubling the wager to $80,000 per team. When his own ricocheting ball strikes his arm, Czervik fakes an injury in hopes of having the contest declared a draw. Lou, who is acting as an umpire, tells Czervik his team will forfeit unless they find a substitute. When Webb chooses Danny, Smails threatens to revoke his scholarship, but Czervik promises Danny that he will make it \"worth his while\" if he wins. Danny chooses to play.\n\nUpon reaching the final hole, the score is tied. Judge Smails scores a [[Birdie (golf)|birdie]]. Danny has to complete a difficult putt to win. Czervik again doubles the wager based on Danny making the putt. Danny's putt leaves the ball hanging over the edge of the hole. At that moment, in his latest attempt to kill the gopher, Carl detonates plastic explosives that he has rigged around the golf course. Several explosions shake the ground and cause the ball to drop into the hole, handing Danny, Webb and Czervik victory on the wager. Smails refuses to pay, so Czervik beckons two intimidating men named Moose and Rocco to \"help the judge find his checkbook.\" As Smails is chased across the course, Czervik quotes to the onlookers, \"Hey, everybody, we're all gonna get laid!\" They all cheer. \n\nSome distance away, the gopher emerges from underground, unharmed, and dances to the film's main theme, \"[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]],\" amid the smoldering ruins of the golf course as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Ty Webb, the son of one of Bushwood Country Club's founders who also runs a lumber mill.\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Al Czervik, a ''[[nouveau riche]]'' golfer and successful real estate developer.\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Elihu Smails, a judge who is one of the founders of Bushwood Country Club who directs the caddy scholarship program.\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Danny Noonan, a teenager who caddies for Ty and works under Lou.\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Carl Spackler, a mentally unstable [[greenskeeper]] at Bushwood Country Club who is charged with the duty of ridding it of the gopher.\n* [[Sarah Holcomb]] as Maggie O'Hooligan, Danny's girlfriend and co-worker.\n* [[Scott Colomby]] as Tony D'Annunzio, Danny's co-worker.\n* [[Cindy Morgan]] as Lacey Underall, the niece of Elihu Smails.\n* [[Dan Resin]] as Dr. Beeper, Elihu Smails' regular golfing partner.\n* [[Henry Wilcoxon]] as Bishop Fred Pickering, a golfing friend of Elihu Smails.\n* Elaine Aiken as Julie Noonan, the mother of Danny.\n* [[Albert Salmi]] as Roy Noonan, the father of Danny.\n* Ann Ryerson as Grace\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Lou Loomis, the head of Bushwood Country Club's caddy shack that Danny and Maggie work for and the manager of the caddies.\n* Hamilton Mitchell as Motormouth\n* [[Peter Berkrot]] as Angie D'Annunzio, the brother of Tony who is Danny's co-worker.\n* John F.

His brothers Bill and John Murray (production assistant and a caddy extra) and director Harold Ramis also had worked as caddies when they were teenagers. Many of the characters in the film were based on characters they had encountered through their various experiences at the club, including a young woman upon whom the character of Maggie is based and the Haverkamps, a doddering old couple, John and Ilma, longtime members of the club, who can barely hit the ball out of their shadows. The scene in which Al Czervik hits Judge Smails in the genitals with a struck golf ball happened to Ramis on what he said was the second of his two rounds of golf, on a nine-hole public course.<ref name=\"biohd\">[https://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&airingid=511286 ''Caddyshack: The Inside Story''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610130346/http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&airingid=511286 |date=June 10, 2011 }}, Bio.HD December 13, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot over eleven weeks during the autumn of 1979; [[Hurricane David]] in early September delayed production.
