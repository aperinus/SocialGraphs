It was produced by [[Eric Eisner (producer)|Eric Eisner]], [[Leonid Rozhetskin]], and Aaron Ryder. ''Hamlet 2'' was filmed primarily at a [[New Mexico]] high school from September to October 2007. The film premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] and was distributed by [[Focus Features]].\n\n==Plot==\nDana Marschz is a recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and failed actor who has become a high school drama teacher in [[Tucson, Arizona]], \"where dreams go to die\". Despite considering himself an inspirational figure, he only has two enthusiastic students, Rand Posin and Epiphany Sellars, and a history of producing poorly received school plays that are essentially stage adaptations of popular [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] films (his latest being ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]''). When the new term begins, a new intake of students are forced to transfer into his class as it is the only remaining arts elective available due to budget cutbacks; they are generally unenthusiastic and unconvinced by Dana's pretensions, and Dana comes into conflict with Octavio, one of the new students.\n\nDana is floored when Principal Rocker notifies him that the drama program is to be shut down at the end of the term. Seeking to inspire his students, Dana undertakes to write and produce an original play: a sequel to ''[[Hamlet]]'' featuring [[time travel]] to avoid the deaths of the characters, and new, more controversial content, including the introduction of [[Jesus Christ]] as one of the characters, complete with a song-and-dance number titled \"Rock Me Sexy Jesus\". The kids gradually warm to the project, but Rand \u2013 cast as a [[bi-curious]] [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] and overshadowed by Octavio as Hamlet \u2013 storms out of the drama group and provides a copy of the play's script to Principal Rocker, who orders Dana to stop the controversial production.\n\nDana is further traumatized when his wife Brie leaves him for the uninteresting, but fertile, boarder Gary they had taken into their home to supplement their modest income, and reveals that he himself is infertile. Despondent, Dana falls off the wagon and tries to abandon the project, but his students encourage him to continue, arranging an abandoned warehouse and rave spot, technical assistance, and security being provided by the high school's football and wrestling teams. Dana also learns that the cancellation of the play has become a [[civil liberties]] issue encouraged by fanatical [[ACLU]] activist Cricket Feldstein. As a result, the play opens to a sold-out house, including a critic from ''[[The New York Times]]''. Rand returns to the group, apologizing for his desertion; Dana allows him to return to the role of Laertes.\n\nThe play itself initially meets with a mixed reception, due to its controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs done to them. Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over. Dana and his favorite actress, [[Elisabeth Shue]] \u2013 whom he is now dating \u2013 meet Dana's students to prepare for the show's [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] opening, complete with original cast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Dana Marschz\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Brie Marschz\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Cricket Feldstein\n* [[David Arquette]] as Gary\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as herself\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Principal Rocker\n* [[Skylar Astin]] as Rand Posin\n* [[Phoebe Strole]] as Epiphany Sellars\n* [[Melonie Diaz]] as Ivonne\n* [[Joseph Julian Soria]] as Octavio Marquez\n* [[Arnie Pantoja]] as Vitamin J\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Glenn from Copy Shop\n* Natalie Amenula as Yolanda\n* Michael Esparza as Chuy\n* Shea Pepe as Noah Sapperstein\n* Arlin Alcala as Protestant\n\n==Production==\nThe play shown within the film was written on deadline for production.<ref name=done>{{cite news | author=David M.
