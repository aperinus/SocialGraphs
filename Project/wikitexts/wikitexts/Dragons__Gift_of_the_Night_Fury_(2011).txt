[[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Kristen Wiig]], and [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] all reprise their roles from the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nRight before Berk's traditional winter holiday of Snoggletog, all the dragons of Berk unexpectedly depart, leaving everyone distraught \u2013 except for Toothless, who cannot fly by himself. Out of compassion, Hiccup builds him a new automatic [[prosthesis]] allowing him independent flight, thus gifting him his freedom; he then flies off too.\n\nThree days later, Meatlug, Fishlegs' dragon whom he had secretly kept chained, escapes, inadvertently taking Hiccup with her. Meatlug flies to an island with hot springs, where all the dragons (except Toothless, who is nowhere to be found) have been hatching their eggs. Meanwhile, on Berk, Astrid and the other teens discover dragon eggs in Meatlug's nest, which they scatter around Berk in hopes of lifting the villagers' spirits; this plan backfires, because dragon eggs hatch explosively (normally underwater). Berk is severely damaged in the process.\n\nOn the dragons' island, Hiccup meets Stormfly (Astrid's dragon) and Hookfang (Snotlout's dragon) and their newly-hatched babies; in asking for a ride home, he inadvertently triggers the dragons' return migration. He quickly decides to use a nearby wrecked ship to carry the baby dragons, who cannot yet fly as far as Berk. The Berkians are overjoyed at their dragons' return and the new babies, though Hiccup is still distraught at Toothless' absence. During the ensuing Snoggletog celebration, Toothless returns with Hiccup's lost helmet, which he had dropped into the sea earlier; the two enjoy a heartfelt reunion.\n\nThe next day, Toothless discards his new tail, begging Hiccup to put the old tailfin on him and fly with him by controlling his fin manually as opposed to passively riding him; in doing so, he gives Hiccup a \"better gift\" \u2013 his friendship and companionship.{{Refn|Hiccup would later build another automatic tailfin for Toothless in ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019).|group=N}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Astrid Hofferson\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Gobber the Belch\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Stoick the Vast\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fishlegs Ingerman\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Snotlout Jorgenson\n* [[T.J.
