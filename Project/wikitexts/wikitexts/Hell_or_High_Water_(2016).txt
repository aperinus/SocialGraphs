It follows two brothers ([[Chris Pine]] and [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]) who carry out a series of bank robberies to save their family ranch, while being pursued by two [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] ([[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Gil Birmingham]]). It was the final film produced by [[OddLot Entertainment]] due to its dissolution in 2015.\n\n''Hell or High Water'' premiered at the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section of the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 16, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 12, 2016. It received critical acclaim, particularly for Pine, Foster, and Bridges' performances, Sheridan's screenplay, and the editing. It grossed $37.9 million on a $12 million budget. The [[American Film Institute]] selected it as one of its [[American Film Institute Awards 2016|ten Movies of the Year]], and it was nominated for numerous awards, including four [[89th Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Bridges), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[West Texas]], brothers Toby and Tanner Howard rob two branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby. Back at their family ranch, they bury their getaway car in a pit with a [[backhoe]]. Their mother has died after a long illness, leaving their ranch in debt because of a [[reverse mortgage]] provided by the Texas Midlands Bank which would lead to [[foreclosure]] if not settled. Meanwhile, oil has been discovered on their land, and Toby is determined to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons.\n\nTwo [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker, are assigned to the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, investigates the robberies and quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They then take the stolen money to an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]] in [[Oklahoma]] to be [[money laundering|laundered]], where Toby has the casino convert their gambling winnings into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\n\nHamilton and Parker stake out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, but find nothing. Hamilton figures a pattern to the bank robberies and determines the next target, and he and Parker head to the site of the next robbery. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist despite the bank being crowded. A shootout ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers, causing Tanner to kill both of them. Later, Toby is shot as they are ambushed by a posse of armed townspeople outside the bank.\n\nThe brothers race out of town with the local posse in pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic weapon at the posse, with his fire superiority forcing them to retreat. The brothers then split up; Toby takes the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots at the police with a rifle, killing Parker in the process. Distraught, Hamilton uses a local resident\u2019s knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner and fatally shoot him.\n\nSimultaneously, Toby manages to pass through a police checkpoint without incident, and launders the stolen cash at the casino, where he sees the news report of his brother's death. He takes the casino's check to the bank just in time to avoid the ranch's foreclosure and deeds the ranch into a [[family trust]].\n\nFollowing his retirement, Hamilton visits his former office and learns that Toby has been cleared as a suspect, as his record is clean and he has no motive since his new oil wells earn more in a month than the total stolen in all of the robberies together. The money from the ranch's oil wells is deposited at the Texas Midlands Bank, which refuses to cooperate with the investigation for fear of losing management of the family's trust fund. Despite the lack of evidence, Hamilton remains certain that Toby was indeed the second bank robber.\n\nHamilton confronts Toby at the ranch, and wishes to know the reason behind the robberies. Toby explains that he has resolved to not let poverty affect his sons like it affected him and Tanner. Hamilton tells Toby he holds him responsible for the death of Parker, and the tension in their conversation builds as a clear prelude to an impending violent shootout.  But they are interrupted when Toby's ex-wife and children arrive. As Hamilton departs, Toby suggests they meet again soon to \"finish the conversation\" and \"bring you some peace\". Hamilton replies that he would like to meet again and maybe he will \"bring some peace\" to Toby before leaving.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/oscars/2017/02/16/hell-or-high-water-screenplay-breakdown |title=Hell or High Water writer explains the film's ambiguous ending |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin P. |date=16 February 2017 |website=EW |access-date=19 February 2019 |quote=I just thought that for either one of them to die was letting them off easy.
