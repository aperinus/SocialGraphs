By accident, he sends Ivan Vasilievich Bunsha ([[Yury Yakovlev]]), superintendent of his apartment building, and George Miloslavsky ([[Leonid Kuravlyov]]), a burglar, back into the time of [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV \"The Terrible\"]]. The pair is forced to disguise themselves, with Bunsha dressing up as Ivan IV (tsar) and Miloslavsky as a [[knyaz]] (duke) of the same name. At the same time, the real Ivan IV (also played by Yury Yakovlev) is sent by the same machine into Shurik's apartment, he has to deal with modern-day life while Shurik tries to fix the machine so that everyone can be brought back to their proper place in time. Superintendent Bunsha and Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible are lookalikes but have completely different personalities, which results in funny situations of mistaken identity. As the police (tipped off by a neighbor who was burgled by Miloslavsky) close in on Shurik, who is frantically trying to repair the machine, the cover of Bunsha and Miloslavsky is blown and they have to fight off the [[Streltsy]], who have figured out that Bunsha is an impostor. The movie ends with Bunsha, Miloslavsky, and Ivan IV all transported back to their proper places, although the entire episode is revealed to be a dream by Shurik... or was it?\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Yury Yakovlev]] ([[Ivan the Terrible]]/Ivan Vasilievich Bunsha, building superintendent)\n* [[Leonid Kuravlyov]] (George Miloslavsky, burglar)\n* [[Aleksandr Demyanenko]] (Aleksandr 'Shurik' Timofeyev, inventor)\n* [[Savely Kramarov]] (Feofan the clerk)\n* [[Natalya Seleznyova]] (Zinaida, his wife)\n* [[Natalya Krachkovskaya]] (Uliana Andreevna Bunsha, superintendent's wife)\n* [[Natalya Kustinskaya]] (Yakin's mistress)\n* [[Vladimir Etush]] (Anton Semyonovich Shpak, dentist)\n* [[Mikhail Pugovkin]] (film director Yakin)\n* [[Sergey Filippov]] (Swedish ambassador)\n* Edward Bredun (black market seller)\n* Natalia Gurzo (Shpak's dental nurse)\n* [[Nina Maslova]] (Tsaritza [[Marfa Sobakina|Marfa]])\n* Viktor Uralsky (Police sergeant-major)\n* [[Leonid Gaidai]] (Yakin's light assistant){{citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n* Ivan Zhevago (Psychiatrist)\n\n==Locations==\n\n===Film locations===\n\n*[[Moscow|Moscow, USSR]]\n\nThe modern Moscow location is [[New Arbat Avenue]], formerly Kalinin Prospekt - then, and perhaps still now, a fairly prestigious location of Moscow, which is not too far from the Kremlin.\n\n*[[Rostov|Rostov, USSR]]\n*[[Yalta|Yalta, USSR]]\n\n==Deviations from the original play==\nThe original play was written by Bulgakov in 1935 (albeit not published until 1965) and, therefore, used a setting typical to the 1930s. The film, released in 1973, made changes to the setting to make it contemporary. For instance, Shpak's [[phonograph]] was replaced in the film with a [[tape recorder]], and the [[Time travel|time machine]] was envisioned as using more advanced technology such as [[transistor]]s. In addition, inventor Timofeyev is inspired to travel to Ivan IV's era after seeing [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|film]] on [[television]], as opposed to listening to the opera ''[[The Maid of Pskov]]'' on the [[radio]].<ref name=\"\u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\">[http://www.ng.ru/saturday/2003-01-31/13_gayday.html \u042f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432 \u0432 \u00ab\u0411\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0435\u00bb]</ref>\n\nThere were other deviations, not related to changes designed to modernize the setting. While the inventor's surname Timofeyev was retained, he was called Nikolai (nicknamed \"Koka\" by his wife Zinaida), while in the film, his name is Alexander (called \"Shurik\" informally). He is presumably an older version of the protagonist of two previous Leonid Gaidai films: ''[[Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures]]'' and ''[[Kidnapping, Caucasian Style]]'', played by the same actor, [[Aleksandr Demyanenko]]; this connection, though, is not stated outright and neither of these earlier films are referenced.<ref name=\"\u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\"/>\n\nIn addition, the reason for the time machine malfunction was changed. In the original play, Bunsha and Miloslavsky knowingly disable the machine to seal the gateway between the two time periods, but are dragged into the past, along with the key to the machine, forcing Timofeyev to make a replacement key. In the film, the time machine is accidentally damaged by a [[halberd]], and Timofeyev has to search for some transistors to repair it.\n\nFinally, while the \"all just a dream\" ending is present in both the play and the film, the play ends on a revelation that Shpak's apartment has been robbed in reality, not only in the dream. This twist is absent in the film.\n\nIn the play, Ivan Vasilievich Bunsha is the son of a nobleman, something which, as a conscientious Soviet bureaucrat, he tries to hide. This isn't mentioned in the film, and would have been an anachronism in 1973.\n\nBunsha's full surname in the play is Bunsha-Koretsky.<ref name=\"\u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\"/>\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Amg movie|169720}}\n*{{IMDb title|0070233}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|ivan_vasilievich_back_to_the_future}}\n* <!-- ATTENTION: this is the OFFICIAL Mosfilm Youtube channel, not a copyvio!!! -->{{YouTube|a50qT9bW2Qo|''Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future'' on official Mosfilm channel}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041029/http://russart.com/?movietrailer&mid=4 Trailer] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185558/http://russart.com/?moviepictures&mid=4 Screenshots]\n* [http://kocby.ru/iv/index.html Screenshots and the script of the film compared with the original play by Bulgakov] (in Russian)\n\n{{Leonid Gaidai}}\n\n[[Category:1973 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Ivan the Terrible]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Mikhail Bulgakov]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Leonid Gaidai]]\n[[Category:Films partially in color]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Aleksandr Zatsepin]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1973]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 16th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Crimea]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Yaroslavl Oblast]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:1970s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Russian science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:Soviet historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Soviet science fiction comedy films]]"}]}}}}
