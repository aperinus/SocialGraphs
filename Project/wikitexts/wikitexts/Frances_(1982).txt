The film stars [[Jessica Lange]] as [[Frances Farmer]], a troubled actress during the 1930s whose career suffered as a result of her [[mental illness]]. It also features [[Kim Stanley]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Bart Burns]], [[Christopher Pennock]], [[Jonathan Banks]], and [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film chronicles Farmer's life from her days as a [[high school]] student, her turbulent relationship with her emotionally abusive mother, her short lived film career in the 1930s, her institutionalization for alleged [[mental illness]] in the 1940s, her [[deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalization]] in the 1950s and her appearance on ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\n''Frances'' was released theatrically on December 3, 1982 by  [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Lange's performance was unanimously praised and has been cited by many (including her) as her best performance.\nAt the [[55th Academy Awards]], it received two nominations for Lange and Stanley as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nBorn in [[Seattle, Washington]], Frances Elena Farmer is a rebel from a young age, winning $100 in 1931 from [[The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards]] for a high school essay called ''God Dies''. In 1935, she becomes controversial again when she wins (and accepts) an all-expenses-paid trip to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to visit its [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. Determined to become an actress, Frances is equally determined not to play the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] game: she refuses to acquiesce to publicity stunts, and insists upon appearing on screen without makeup. She marries her first husband, Dwayne Steele, despite being advised not to, but cheats on him with alleged Communist Harry York on the night of her hometown's premiere of ''[[Come and Get It (1936 film)|Come and Get It]]''. Her defiance attracts the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[playwright]] [[Clifford Odets]], who convinces Frances that her future rests with the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]].\n\nAfter leaving Hollywood for [[New York City]] and appearing in the Group Theatre [[play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', Frances learns, much to her chagrin, that the Group Theatre exploited her fame only to draw in more customers, replacing her with a wealthy actress for her family's needed financial backing for the play's [[London]] tour, and Odets ends their [[affair]] upon his wife's upcoming return from Europe. Her desperate attempts to restart her film career upon returning to Hollywood results in being cast in unchallenging roles in forgettable [[B-film]]s. Her increased dependence on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[amphetamines]] in the 1940s and the pressures brought on her by her [[:wikt:wannabe|wannabe]] mother, who becomes her legal guardian after her multiple legal problems, result in a complete [[nervous breakdown]]. After her first hospitalization at Kimball Sanitarium in [[La Crescenta]] where she was forced to undergo [[insulin]] shock therapy and hydrotherapy, she tells her mother that she doesn't want to return to Hollywood but instead wants to live alone in the countryside, assaulting and threatening Lillian in the resulting argument.  While [[Psychiatric hospital|institutionalized]] at [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]], Frances is abused by [[the powers that be]]: she is subjected to [[electroconvulsive shock therapy]], is cruelly beaten, periodically [[rape]]d by the male orderlies and visiting soldiers from a nearby military base and involuntarily [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] before her release in 1950.\n\nIn 1958, Frances is paid honor on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' television program, which Harry York watches from his home. When asked about [[alcoholism]], [[illegal drugs]] and [[mental illness]], Farmer denies them all and says, \"If you're treated like a patient, you're apt to act like one\". The film ends just after a party honoring her at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with Farmer walking down a street with Harry York, talking about her parents' deaths, how she sold their house and that she's a \"faceless sinner\" with a slower paced lifestyle ahead of her in the future. The end credits state that she moved to [[Indianapolis]] shortly afterwards, hosting a local [[daytime TV]] program (''[[Frances Farmer Presents]]'') from 1958 to 1964 before dying alone, just as she had lived, on August 1, 1970 at age 56.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as [[Frances Farmer]]\n* [[Kim Stanley]] as Lillian Van Ornum Farmer\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Harry York\n* [[Bart Burns]] as Ernest Farmer\n* [[Christopher Pennock]] as Dick Steele\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Hitchhiker\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as [[Clifford Odets]]\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Luther Adler|Luther]] (uncredited)\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Mental patient \n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Mental patient \n* [[Pamela Gordon (actress)|Pamela Gordon]] as Mental patient\n* [[Rick May]] as Policeman\n\n==Production==\nThe film was developed by the team who had made ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', writers [[Eric Bergren]] and Christopher De Vore, and producer Jonathan Sanger and Mel Brooks. Brooks was keen for David Lynch, who had directed ''The Elephant Man'', to direct. However, Lynch had signed an agreement with Universal. Sanger then suggested [[Graeme Clifford]], who was well established as an editor, notably having made several films with Robert Altman. \"He's very bright and completely in love with the story,\" said Brooks.<ref>Mel Brooks and the sad Seattle cinema usherette The Guardian 10 Oct 1981: 11.</ref>\n\nThe script was based upon William Arnold's ''[[Shadowland (Arnold)|Shadowland]]'', a fictional biography of Farmer. In pre-production, the producers reneged on their option to use the book as source material. Arnold filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit but many of his fictional elements were incorporated into the final film.<ref>Hollywood's power of attorney\nMills, Bart.

She tried to interest [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bob Fosse]] to make the film but neither was interested. Then she says Clifford called her directly offering the role.

According to Barry, his idea of carrying the main theme using a harmonica was initially disliked by producers until they heard it fully orchestrated.\nAlong with some popular songs from the period, a notable piece of music was from [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Mozart's Piano Sonata No.11, K331]], and the second movement of [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's seventh Symphony]] also featured.\n\n===Editing===\nThe film originally ran for three hours and was cut down. This meant reduction of the amount of screen time dedicated to Frances and her parents, and Frances and her love interest. Clifford would subsequently claim he felt the film was too short.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Frances'' holds a 66% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 29 reviews with the consensus: \"This sordid biopic emphasizes the indignities visited upon Frances Farmer to the detriment of fleshing her out as a person, but Jessica Lange's towering performance invests the tragic figure with a humanity that the script lacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frances/|title=Frances rating |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2022-06-14}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
