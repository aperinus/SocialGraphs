While harsh criticism focused on the film's comedic and [[Camp (style)|campy]] tone, as well as on the casting and performance of Pryor, the special effects and Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman were praised.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'', was released in July 1987.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]-based [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] Webscoe hires Gus Gorman, a talented computer programmer. Gus embezzles from his employer through [[Salami slicing tactics#Financial fraud|salami slicing]], which brings him to the attention of [[CEO]] Ross Webster. Webster is intrigued by Gus' potential to help him financially. Webster, his sister Vera, and Webster's girlfriend Lorelei blackmail Gus into helping him.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', [[Clark Kent]] convinces [[Perry White]] to let him and [[Jimmy Olsen]] visit  [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] for Clark's [[high school reunion|high-school reunion]], while fellow reporter and Clark's unrequited romantic interest [[Lois Lane]] leaves for a [[Bermuda]] vacation. En route, as [[Superman]], Kent extinguishes a fire in a [[chemical plant]] containing unstable beltric acid, which produces corrosive vapor when superheated.\n\nAt the reunion, Clark reunites with childhood friend [[Lana Lang]], a divorc\u00e9e with a young son named Ricky. Clark is harassed by Brad Wilson, his former bully and Lana's ex-boyfriend. Later, while having a [[picnic]] with Lana, Superman saves an unconscious Ricky from being killed by a [[combine harvester]].\n\nInfuriated by [[Colombia]]'s refusal to do business with him, Webster orders Gus to command Vulcan, an American [[weather satellite]], to create a [[tornado]] to destroy Colombia's coffee crop, allowing Webster to [[corner the market]]. Gus travels to Smallville to use a Webscoe subsidiary to reprogram the satellite. Although Vulcan creates a devastating storm, Superman neutralizes it. Seeing Superman as a threat to his plans, Webster orders Gus to fabricate [[Kryptonite]]. Gus uses Vulcan to locate and analyze [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]'s debris. As one of the elements of Kryptonite is unknown, he substitutes [[tar (tobacco residue)|tar]].\n\nLana convinces Superman to appear at Ricky's birthday party, but Smallville turns it into a town celebration. Gus and Vera, disguised as [[United States Army|Army]] officers, give Superman the flawed Kryptonite as an award. Although it has no immediate effect, Superman becomes selfish, and then commits petty acts of vandalism such as straightening the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and blowing out the [[Olympic Flame]].\n\nGus asks Webster to build the world's most sophisticated [[supercomputer]]; the CEO agrees, if Gus creates an [[energy crisis]] by directing all [[oil tanker]]s to the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. When the captain of one tanker insists on maintaining his original course, Lorelei seduces Superman, persuading him to waylay the tanker and breach its [[double hull]], causing an [[oil spill]]. The villains decamp to the supercomputer's location in [[Glen Canyon]].\n\nSuperman suffers a nervous breakdown and splits into two beings: the immoral, corrupted dark Superman and the moral, mild-mannered Clark Kent. The two fight in a junkyard, with Clark eventually defeating his evil self. Regaining his sanity, Superman repairs the damage he caused in the oil spill and heads west to deal with the villains. After defending himself from exploding rockets and an [[ASALM]] missile, Superman confronts Webster, Vera, and Lorelei. The supercomputer identifies Superman's weakness and unleashes a beam of pure Kryptonite.\n\nGuilt-ridden and horrified by the notion of \"going down in history as the man who killed Superman\", Gus destroys the Kryptonite ray with a firefighter's axe. Superman escapes, but [[cybernetic revolt|the computer becomes self-aware]], defending itself against Gus's attempts to disable it. The computer transforms Vera into a [[cyborg]] that attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy that immobilize them. Superman returns with beltric acid, which the supercomputer believes is not dangerous. The intense heat emitted by the supercomputer causes the acid to become volatile, destroying it. Superman leaves Webster and his cronies for the authorities and drops Gus off at a [[West Virginia]] [[coal mine]], recommending him to the company as a computer programmer.\n\nAs Clark, Superman visits Lana after she moves to Metropolis. A drunken Brad attacks Clark believing he was proposing to her, but the reporter defeats him without revealing his secret identity. Lana's new job as Perry White's secretary surprises Lois Lane, who returns from her vacation with an article about corruption in Bermuda, and has a newfound respect for Clark after reading his story. Before lunch with Lana, Superman restores the Leaning Tower of Pisa and flies into the sunrise for further adventures.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Superman (1978 film series character)|Clark Kent / Superman]]: After discovering his origins in the earlier films, he sets himself to helping those on Earth. After defeating his arch enemies, [[Lex Luthor]] twice and [[General Zod]], Superman comes face-to-face with a new villain: the megalomaniac Ross Webster, who is determined to control the world's coffee and oil supplies. Superman also battles personal demons after an exposure to a synthetic form of kryptonite that corrupts him.\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as August \"Gus\" Gorman: A bumbling computer genius who works for Ross Webster and inadvertently gets mixed up in Webster's scheme to destroy Superman.\n* [[Jackie Cooper]] as [[Perry White]]: The editor of the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]: A photographer for the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Annette O'Toole]] as [[Lana Lang]]: Clark's high school friend who reconciles with Clark after seeing him during their high school reunion. O'Toole later portrayed Martha Kent on the Superman television series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Ross \"Bubba\" Webster: A villainous, super-wealthy industrialist and philanthropist. After Superman prevents him from taking over the world's coffee supply, Ross is determined to destroy Superman before he can stop his plan to control the world's oil supply. He is an original character created for the movie.\n* [[Annie Ross]] as Vera Webster: Ross' sister and partner in his corporation and villainous plans.\n* [[Pamela Stephenson]] as Lorelei Ambrosia: Ross' assistant. Lorelei, a voluptuous blonde bombshell, is well-read, articulate and skilled in computers, but conceals her intelligence from Ross and Vera, to whom she adopts the appearance of a superficial, stereotypical klutz. As part of Ross' plan, she seduces Superman.\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]]: A reporter at the ''Daily Planet'' who has a history with both Clark Kent and Superman. She is away from Metropolis on vacation to [[Bermuda]], which put her in the middle of a front-page story.\n* [[Gavan O'Herlihy]] as Brad Wilson: Lana's ex-boyfriend and Clark's high school rival.\n\nFilm director/puppeteer [[Frank Oz]] originally had a cameo in this film as a [[surgeon]], but the scene was ultimately deleted, though it was later included in the TV extended version of the film. [[Shane Rimmer]], who had a role in ''[[Superman II]]'' as a NASA controller, has a small part as a state police officer. Pamela Mandell, who played a diner waitress in the same film, appears here as the hapless wife of a ''Daily Planet'' sweepstakes winner. Aaron Smolinski, who had played baby Clark Kent in the first film, appears in this one as the little boy next to the photo booth Superman changes into. He also would later appear in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' as a communications officer.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard Donner]] confirmed that he had been interested in writing at least two more ''Superman'' films, which he intended to allow [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to direct, and that he would have included [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] as the villain of the third film.

Hackman would reprise his role as Lex Luthor in ''[[Superman IV]]'', with which the Salkinds had no involvement. In his commentary for the 2006 DVD release of ''Superman III'', [[Ilya Salkind]] denied any ill will between Margot Kidder and his production team and denied the claim that her part was cut for retaliation. Instead, he said, the creative team decided to pursue a different direction for a love interest for Superman, believing the Lois and Clark relationship had been played out in the first two films, (but could be revisited in the future). With the choice to give a more prominent role to Lana Lang, Lois' part was reduced for story reasons. Salkind also denied the reports about Gene Hackman being upset with him, stating that Hackman was unable to return because of other film commitments.\n\nAfter an appearance by Richard Pryor on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'',<ref name=\"Superman III\">{{cite web | title=The Superman Super Site - Superman III | url=http://www.supermansupersite.com/movie3.html | access-date = January 10, 2008}}</ref> telling [[Johnny Carson]] how much he enjoyed seeing ''[[Superman II]]'', the Salkinds were eager to cast him in a prominent role in the third film, riding on Pryor's success in films such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Toy (1982 film)|The Toy]]''.<ref name=\"fast-rewind\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/supermaniii.htm|title=Article on Superman III|work=fast-rewind.com|location=United States|access-date=August 7, 2006}}</ref> Pryor accepted a $5 million salary to appear in the film.<ref name=\":4\" /> Following the release of the film, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] worth $40 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm | work=BBC News | title=Comedian Richard Pryor dead at 65 | date=December 10, 2005 | access-date=May 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography commenced on June 21, 1982.

Lester broke tradition by setting the opening credits for ''Superman III'' during a prolonged [[Slapstick|slapstick sequence]] rather than in outer space.\n\nThe film's screenplay, by [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]], was also criticized.<ref name=\"Superman III\"/> When Richard Donner was hired to direct the first two films, he found the Newmans' scripts so distasteful that he hired [[Tom Mankiewicz]] for heavy rewrites. Since Donner and Mankiewicz were no longer attached, the Salkinds were free to bring their version of ''Superman'' to the screen and once again hired the Newmans for writing duties.<ref name=\"Superman II\" /> Reeve stated in his autobiography that the original script for the first ''Superman'' had so many puns and gags that it risked having Superman earn a reputation akin to that of [[Batman]] being associated with [[Batman (TV series)|the campy TV show of the 1960s]]. \"In one scene in this script, Superman would be in pursuit of Lex Luthor, identified by his bald head and grab him, only to realize he had captured [[Telly Savalas]] who would remark \"Who loves ya, baby?\" and offer Superman a lollipop. Dick [Donner] had done away with much of that inanity.\"\n\nReeve's own performance as a corrupted Man of Steel received praise, particularly the junkyard battle between this newly darkened Superman and Clark Kent.<ref name=\"rot\"/> One of the film's positive reviews was from the fiction writer [[Donald Barthelme]], who praised Reeve as \"perfect\", also describing Vaughn as \"essentially playing [[William F.
