It was the first film by Zemeckis' production company [[ImageMovers]]. The film opened in 2,813 theaters in North America, and grossed $291 million at the worldwide box office, becoming the [[2000 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. It received mixed reviews, but was nominated for three [[Saturn Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer cellist Claire Spencer and her husband Norman, an accomplished scientist and professor, live a quiet life in [[Vermont]]. Their relationship seems slightly strained, particularly after Claire's daughter, Caitlin, leaves for college. Claire notices the new neighbors, Mary and Warren Feur, appear to have a volatile relationship. After Mary is unseen for several days, Claire suspects Warren may have killed her.\n\nWhile by the lake next to their house, Claire believes she sees a woman's body in the water. She later discovers an odd key inside a heater vent. After unusual occurrences and sensing a presence in the house, Claire and her mystic friend, Jody, hold a failed [[s\u00e9ance]]. Claire later finds the bathtub filled with hot water and, \"You know,\" written on the steamy mirror. Claire's computer inexplicably types \"MEF\" repeatedly. Claire becomes convinced it is the missing Mary's spirit, but Norman discounts this. Several days later, Mary returns home alive and well, explaining she went to her mother's in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] after a fight with Warren.\n\nA framed newspaper article about Norman mysteriously falls off his desk and shatters. On the article's reverse side, Claire reads a piece about a missing woman named Madison Elizabeth Frank (\"MEF\"). Claire tracks down and visits Madison's mother, who shows her Madison's bedroom. While there, Claire steals a lock of Madison's hair, and notices a photo of her wearing an unusual necklace.\n\nLater that night, Claire, holding Madison's hair, performs a ritual from a book. She [[Invocation|conjures]] Madison, whose spirit [[Spirit possession|possesses]] her. While still possessed, Claire aggressively seduces Norman. Madison, speaking through Claire, shocks Norman. Claire, dropping the lock of hair, immediately becomes herself again. She then recalls a [[repressed memory]] about Norman's affair with a student. Norman admits it happened during a rough patch in their marriage. Claire leaves and spends the night with Jody, who reveals that a year earlier, she saw Norman arguing with a blonde woman at a caf\u00e9 in Adamant, a nearby town.\n\nClaire returns home and finds Norman unconscious in the tub. He seemingly recovers and claims it was an accident and not a [[suicide]] attempt. He denies killing Madison. Norman later finds Claire standing on the lake dock. Claire, holding Madison's hair, is pulled into the water by an unseen force. Dragged to the bottom, she sees a jewelry box with the same symbol as Madison's necklace. Before she can grab it, Norman has jumped in and pulls her to the surface. They then burn the lock of hair.\n\nClaire later visits a shop in Adamant, where she sees a jewelry box with the same design as the one in the lake. Claire recovers the box from the lake and unlocks it with the key she previously found. Inside is Madison's necklace. Norman changes his story, claiming Madison killed herself in their house. He says he pushed her car into the lake with her body inside. Norman agrees to confess to authorities, but Claire discovers he dialed [[4-1-1|411]], and faked the conversation. Norman paralyzes Claire with [[halothane]], and admits he murdered Madison when she threatened to expose their affair to the dean.\n\nNorman places Claire in the bathtub, filling it with water to stage her suicide. He spots Madison's necklace around Claire's neck. When Claire's face seems to contort into Madison's corpse, Norman jerks back and smashes his head on the bathroom sink, rendering him unconscious. As the water level rises, Claire recovers enough from the paralysis to partially close the tap and then dislodge the stopper, barely surviving drowning. Norman has left the bathroom and she finds him seemingly unconscious downstairs. She flees in the couple's truck. As she crosses the bridge over [[Lake Champlain]], Norman, hiding in the truck bed, attacks Claire, who frantically dials 911 on her cell phone. The truck careens down the embankment into the lake. As it sinks, it dislodges Madison's car. Madison's body floats toward the couple as Norman tries to drown Claire. Madison grabs Norman's arm, shocking him, which allows Claire to escape. Norman drowns and Madison's ghost drifts away. Later that winter, Claire places a red rose on Madison's grave.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Dr. Norman Spencer, a successful college professor and scientist. \n*[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Claire Spencer, Norman's wife. \n*[[Diana Scarwid]] as Jody, a mystic and Claire's best friend.\n*[[Miranda Otto]] as Mary Feur, Norman and Claire's neighbor.\n*[[James Remar]] as Warren Feur, Norman and Claire's neighbor and Mary's husband.\n*Katharine Towne as Caitlin Spencer, Claire's daughter and Norman's stepdaughter.\n*[[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Dr. Stan Powell\n*[[Joe Morton]] as Dr. Drayton, a therapist whom Claire visits upon Norman's urging.\n*[[Amber Valletta]] as Madison Elizabeth Frank, a murdered young woman with whom Norman has had an affair.\n*[[Wendy Crewson]] as Elena\n\n==Production==\nDocumentary filmmaker [[Sarah Kernochan]] had adapted a personal experience with the paranormal as a script treatment featuring a retirement aged couple dealing with restless but compassionate spirits.
