Macy]], [[Dean Stockwell]], and [[Paul Guilfoyle]]. The film was written by [[Andrew W. Marlowe]]. It tells the story of a group of terrorists who [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]] [[Air Force One]] and the [[President of the United States|President]]'s attempt to rescue everyone on board by retaking his plane.\n\nThe film was a box office success and received mostly positive critical reviews. It became the [[1997 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 1997]].\n\n==Plot==\nA joint operation between American and Russian Special Forces captures General Radek, the dictator of a rogue [[Neo-Sovietism|neo-Soviet]] regime in [[Kazakhstan]] that retained its [[nuclear weapon]]s, threatening war. Three weeks after the mission, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] James Marshall attends a diplomatic dinner in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], during which he praises the operation and insists the U.S. will \"no longer negotiate with terrorists\". Marshall and his entourage, including his wife Grace and daughter Alice, and several of his cabinet and advisers, prepare to return home on [[Air Force One]]. In addition, members of the press have been invited aboard, including six Radek loyalists disguised as journalists, led by Egor Korshunov.\n\nAfter takeoff, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Gibbs, a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], enables Korshunov and his men to obtain weapons and storm the plane, killing many of the other security and military personnel before taking the rest hostage, including Grace and Alice. Marshall is raced to an [[escape pod]] in the [[cargo hold]] while pursued by Korshunov's men, but they are too late to stop the pod from ejecting. Korshunov breaches the cockpit and slays the crew, narrowly preventing the plane from making an emergency landing at [[Ramstein Air Force Base]] in [[Germany]]. A squadron of [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15s]] escort Air Force One as Korshunov has it piloted towards a Radek-loyal airbase in Kazakhstan.\n\nUnknown to all, Marshall, a [[Vietnam veteran|veteran of the Vietnam War]] and a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, had hidden himself in the cargo hold instead of using the pod, and stealthily observes the loyalists. He covertly kills some of Korshunov's men and uses a satellite phone to communicate with [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Kathryn Bennett, letting his staff know he is still alive and aboard the plane. Korshunov, assuming that it is merely a Secret Service agent that is in the cargo hold, contacts Bennett and demands Radek's release, threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour. Marshall and military advisors devise a plan to trick Korshunov to take Air Force One to a lower altitude for a [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]], buying time for the hostages to parachute safely off the plane. As a [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10]] tanker docks with Air Force One, Marshall helps to capture another loyalist and escorts the hostages to the cargo hold, where the majority parachute to safety. Korshunov discovers the deception and forces Air Force One to break the connection with the tanker, causing the fuel to ignite and destroying the tanker; the consequent shockwave disrupts the escape process, and Korshunov is able to stop Marshall, [[Chief of Staff]] Lloyd Shepherd, Major Caldwell and Gibbs from escaping. Some hostages and the captured loyalist fall out of the plane without parachutes to their deaths.\n\nWith the president and his family under his control, Korshunov violently berates Marshall for killing his men, and forces him to contact Russian President Petrov and arrange for Radek's release. Bennett is urged by Defense Secretary Walter Dean to declare the president incapable under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]], thus overriding Radek's release, but she refuses. While Korushunov and his men celebrate the news of Radek's release, Marshall breaks his bonds and kills Korshunov and his remaining henchmen. Marshall then rescinds his order to release Radek, who is subsequently shot dead when he attempts to escape.\n\nMarshall and Caldwell direct the plane back to friendly airspace, accompanied by the F-15s, only to be quickly tailed by a second batch of Radek loyalists in [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]]. Marshall is saved by one F-15 pilot who sacrifices himself to intercept a missile; the resultant explosion damages the plane's tail, and they start to lose altitude. A standby USAF Rescue [[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]] with the callsign Liberty 24 is called to help, sending [[United States Air Force Pararescue|parajumpers]] on tether lines to rescue the survivors. Marshall insists that his family and the injured Shepherd be transferred first. When there is time for only one more transfer, Gibbs reveals himself as the traitor, killing Caldwell and the last parajumper. Marshall and Gibbs fight for control of the transfer line; Marshall grabs and detaches it at the last moment. As the HC-130 airmen reel Marshall to safety, the now inoperable Air Force One crashes into the [[Caspian Sea]], killing Gibbs. With Marshall and his family safe, Liberty 24 is given the callsign Air Force One as they fly back to safety.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[List of fictional presidents of the United States (K-M)#President James Marshall|President James Marshall]], the popular President of the United States and a family man, who loves his wife, Grace, and daughter, Alice.

They based some of the film's scenes on the touring experience when the terrorists disguised as journalists survey the plane's layout and begin to take their seats.

According to director Wolfgang Petersen, Gibbs was a former CIA agent who lost a lot after the end of the [[Cold War]] and thus became angry with the American government and wanted revenge. He knew the terrorists from his CIA days and so they included him in their operation. The scene was considered too long to tell and so it was cut from the film. The director also felt that it was unnecessary to have in the film so it was removed as it was irrelevant to the plot. Petersen also said that in the original draft, Gibbs revealed himself as the mole early and joined the terrorists in hijacking the plane. The director felt it was more suspenseful to keep the audience guessing in the final cut and specifically pointed to the scene in which Marshall gives Gibbs a gun before escorting the hostages from the conference room to the parachutes in the cargo hold.<ref name=commentary/>\n\nGary Oldman did not stay in character between the scenes.

Although the book has the same central plot and outcomes as the film, its main storyline has additional scenes and lines not in the film. The book develops characters more than the film. Marshall is described as possessing a smile that is described in the novel as \"the most valuable weapon in his public relations arsenal\" (p.&nbsp;11). He promotes an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] line on foreign policy and a strong stance against terrorism (met with political opposition from opposition [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], Franklin Danforth, in the novel). He is described as a first-term President, up for re-election later on in the year that the film is set in. Marshall's home state is [[Iowa]]. A two-term former governor of Iowa in the novel, he first campaigns in the film for the US House.\n\nHe graduated from [[University of Iowa]] in the early 1970s in the novel and may also have attended the [[University of Notre Dame]]. His senior Staff and Cabinet include Vice President Kathryn Bennett (former congresswoman and trial attorney from [[New Jersey]]), [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Lloyd Shepherd (an old friend from [[University of Iowa|U of I]]), [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Jack Doherty, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Walter Dean, [[Deputy Director of the National Security Agency|Deputy NSA Director]] Thomas Lee, Deputy [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]] Melanie Mitchell, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] Northwood, Air Force General Greeley (under whom Marshall served in Vietnam). His Party is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in the novel.\n\nMarshall is described in the novel as \"a moderate-Republican version of [[Bill Clinton]], minus the womanizing reputation, and without a hint of personal or professional scandal\" (p.&nbsp;99\u2013100). Korushunov's family is expanded upon, and it is revealed that Korushunov is not his real name. Unlike the movie, Gibbs's identity as the traitor is not revealed until the end of the book. It also hints at his motivation: \"What he did remember, as he sipped his coffee, was that he knew these men, had worked with these men, and it was a damn shame they had to die so that he could be wealthy.\" Korushunov later tells Marshall he \"paid\" him off. It also presents a slightly alternative ending: in the novel, ''Air Force One'' crashes in the Russian countryside, but in the film, it crashes into the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/663082.Air_Force_One|title=Air Force One review|publisher=[[Goodreads]]|access-date=November 18, 2015|archive-date=November 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101235747/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/663082.Air_Force_One|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |access-date=September 28, 2011 |url=http://garyoldman.info/Movies/thumbnails.php?album=18 |title=''Air Force One'' Movie Gallery |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208095140/http://www.garyoldman.info/movies/thumbnails.php?album=18 |archive-date=December 8, 2008}}\n* {{cite web |access-date=October 5, 2010 |url=http://www.rad.net.nz/index.php?id=843 |title=Air Force One as Political Communication|first=Richard|last=Davis|work=Radiescent}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/matinee.cfm?Film=air-for&File=productn |work=Film Scouts |author=Film Scouts |title=''Air Force One'': About The Production |year=1999 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000106101418/http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/matinee.cfm?Film=air-for&File=productn |archive-date=January 6, 2000}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Air Force One (film)|Air Force One}}\n{{portal|Film}}\n* {{AFI film|60488|Air Force One}}\n* {{IMDb title|0118571|Air Force One}}\n* {{tcmdb title|328888|Air Force One}}\n* {{Allmovie title|156948|Air Force One}}\n\n{{Wolfgang Petersen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Air Force One}}\n[[Category:1997 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American political thriller films]]\n[[Category:Beacon Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films about aviation accidents or incidents]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about aircraft hijackings]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wolfgang Petersen]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Caspian Sea]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kazakhstan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in the White House]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films set on airplanes]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cleveland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gail Katz]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Air Force]]\n[[Category:United States presidential succession in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films about Air Force One]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
