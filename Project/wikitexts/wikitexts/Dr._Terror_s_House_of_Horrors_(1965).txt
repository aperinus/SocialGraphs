During the journey, the doctor opens his pack of [[Tarot of Marseilles|Tarot]] cards (which he calls his \"House of Horrors\") and proceeds to reveal the destinies of each of the travellers. This provides the framework to tell five horror stories.\n\n* [[Peter Cushing]] - Dr. Schreck\n\n===Werewolf===\nArchitect Jim Dawson ([[Neil McCallum (actor)|Neil McCallum]]) returns to his old family home on a Scottish isle to make renovations for the new owner, Mrs. Biddulph ([[Ursula Howells]]). Biddulph explains she bought the secluded house to help her recover from the death of her husband, to whose memory she would like to dedicate a newly enlarged room as a museum.\n\nDawson finds behind a fake wall in the cellar the coffin of Count Cosmo Valdemar. Valdemar, the original owner of the house, was killed in a conflict with the Dawson family centuries ago. Local legend states that Valdemar would reclaim his former home and take revenge on the current owner. Dawson discovers that Valdemar is rising at night as a [[Werewolf fiction|werewolf]], and has already killed a housemaid (Katy Wild).\n\nBelieving Mrs. Biddulph to be in danger, he makes silver bullets out of an ancestral cross that was produced from the sword historically used to kill the monster. However, when the creature surges again from his tomb in the cellar, Dawson is baffled to find such bullets ineffective. He runs upstairs to protect Mrs. Biddulph within her room, but the lady reveals that she has replaced the ammunition with ordinary ones. She clarifies how the actual curse meant that Valdemar will take revenge on the last descendant of the Dawson clan, not on the current owner of the estate; and that his death and placement in Valdemar's coffin will fully restore the werewolf to life in human form. It was all a trap: Biddulph is Valdemar's wife, who has returned from the grave after 200 years and proceeds to attack and kill Dawson.\n\n* [[Neil McCallum (actor)|Neil McCallum]] - Jim Dawson\n* [[Ursula Howells]] - Deirdre Biddulph\n* [[Peter Madden (actor)|Peter Madden]] - Caleb\n* Katy Wild - Valda\n* [[Edward Underdown]] - Tod\n\n===Creeping Vine===\nBill Rogers ([[Alan Freeman]]) and his wife and daughter ([[Ann Bell]] and [[Phoebe Nicholls|Sarah Nicholls]]) return from their holiday to discover a fast-growing vine in the garden. When the plant seems to respond violently to attempts to cut it down, Rogers goes to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], where he gets advice from a couple of scientists (played by [[Bernard Lee]] and [[Jeremy Kemp]]). The plant shows increasing signs of intelligence, murderous intent and self-preservation, first killing the family dog, then one of the scientist and finally blocking all windows and doors to the house, and even snapping the phone line. Fire appears for a few moments to scare it away, until that too becomes ineffective as the vine learns to put out a flame.\n\n* [[Ann Bell]] - Ann Rogers\n* [[Bernard Lee]] - Hopkins\n* [[Alan Freeman]] - Bill Rogers\n* [[Jeremy Kemp]] - Jerry Drake\n* [[Phoebe Nicholls|Sarah Nicholls]] - Carol Rogers\n\n===Voodoo===\nBiff Bailey ([[Roy Castle]]) is a happy-go-lucky jazz musician, who promptly accepts a gig in the [[West Indies]] with his band. Upon witnessing a local [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] ceremony, he loves the exhotic rhythm and tries to pitch on the natives the idea to use it as template for new commercial music.\nDespite warnings not to \"steal\" the sacred tunes from the god, Biff tries to use them for a jazz performance back in London, overtly mocking that religion. The show is suddenly halted by a stormy wind which makes the public flee, and leads Bailey as well to leave the stage and stumble in the streets until he comes across a garish poster for \"Dr Terror's House of Horrors\". \nThis story may be {{weasel inline|date=July 2017}} based on the short story \"Papa Benjamin\" by [[Cornell Woolrich]], which was also adapted by the television series ''[[Thriller (U.S. TV series)|Thriller]]'' and the radio series ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The quintet of British jazz saxophonist [[Tubby Hayes]] appears as Bailey's backing band.\n\n* [[Roy Castle]] - Biff Bailey\n* [[Kenny Lynch]] - Sammy Coin\n* [[Harold Lang (actor)|Harold Lang]] - Roy Shine\n* Christopher Carlos - Vrim\n* [[Thomas Baptiste]] - Dambala\n\n===Disembodied Hand===\nPompous art critic Franklyn Marsh (Christopher Lee) seems more concerned with his own devastating wit than art itself. \nPainter Eric Landor ([[Michael Gough]]) bears the brunt of one of Marsh's tirades, but gets even by humiliating the critic publicly. He shows that Franklyn mistakes the work of a chimpanzee for modern art, and subsequently follows him at public speeches and social gatherings, silencing his contributions mid-way with shameful reminders of the error.\nIncreasingly exasperated, finally Marsh retaliates by running over Landor with his car, causing Landor to lose the right hand. Unable to paint any more, Landor commits suicide. From this moment Marsh is tormented by the disembodied hand of the artist, which seems immune to fire and any other attempts to contain it. In a last attack while Franklyn is driving, the car crashes and the broken window leads to Marsh's permanent blindness.\n\n* [[Christopher Lee]] - Franklyn Marsh\n* [[Michael Gough]] - Eric Landor\n* [[Isla Blair]] - Pretty girl\n* [[Judy Cornwell]] - Nurse\n* Hedger Wallace - Surgeon\n\n===Vampire===\nDr Bob Carroll ([[Donald Sutherland]]) returns to his home in the United States with his new French bride, Nicolle ([[Jennifer Jayne]]). Soon there is evidence that a [[vampire]] is on the loose, and Carroll seeks the aid of his colleague, Dr Blake ([[Max Adrian]]). They find that Nicolle is the vampire. Following Blake's advice, Carroll kills Nicolle. When the police come to arrest Carroll for his wife's murder, Blake denies giving any such advice. As the police take Carroll away, Blake says to himself that the town isn't big enough for two doctors or two vampires, and he turns into a bat.\n\n* [[Max Adrian]] - Dr. Blake\n* [[Jennifer Jayne]] - Nicolle Carroll\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] - Dr. Bob Carroll\n* [[Al Mulock]] - Detective\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe frame story ends with a twist. After showing sympathy to all his fellow passengers and attempting not to show them the prediction of death that all received from the tarots' deck,  Dr. Schreck informs the men that this would be the only way that they could escape the forecast of an even more horrible destiny. \nHe then vanishes during a moment of darkness. Puzzled and fearful, the men have a moment of relief when the train stops and they assume this to mean having reached the intended destination.\nAt the station however they are alone in a dark, silent and spooky atmosphere. Suddenly the wind carries a newspaper, with the report of an accident in which they all died. Schreck reappears in a black mantel, and he is revealed to be [[Death (personification)|Death himself]]. The men begin to slowly follow him in the darkness as the credits roll.\n\n==Production==\n''Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'' was a conscious attempt by Milton Subotsky to repeat the success of ''[[Dead of Night]]'' (1945). Subotsky considered that movie to be \"the greatest horror film ever,\"<ref>Brosnan, John. ''The Horror People''. London, 1976.</ref> and used it as a blueprint for ''Dr. Terror'' and the rest of Amicus's portmanteau films. The script began as a stillborn television series in 1948 during the time when ''Dead of Night'' was a recent release.  Subotsky wrote the original stories in 1948 when he was employed as a scriptwriter for NBC's ''[[Lights Out (radio show)#Television|Lights Out]]'' series.<ref name=\"amicus\"/>\n\nDonald Sutherland was paid \u00a31,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1000|1965|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) for his performance.<ref name=\"amicus\"/>\n===Filming===\nFilming began on ''Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'' at [[Shepperton Studios]] on 25 May 1964 with a budget of \u00a3105,000 and was completed on 3 July 1964.\n\nIt was filmed using the cinematic process known as [[Techniscope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32c9DwAAQBAJ&q=dr+terror%27s+house+of+horrors+techniscope&pg=PT146|title=The British Horror Film: From the Silent to the Multiplex|first=Ian|last=Fryer|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Fonthill Media|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\nIn a contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted \"a usefully chilly package deal which will offer audiences several mild shudders and quite a lot of amusement.
