The film was directed by [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]] and Michele Imperato Stabile, with a screenplay written by [[Brian Lynch (writer)|Brian Lynch]], [[Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio|Cinco Paul]], and [[Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio|Ken Daurio]]. Paul and Daurio also conceived the film's story. Starring [[James Marsden]], [[Russell Brand]], [[Kaley Cuoco]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Chelsea Handler]], and [[Hugh Laurie]], the film follows a young rabbit who would rather drum in a band than succeed his father as the Easter Bunny, as a human  slacker have the title for himself.\n\n''Hop'' premiered at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]] in Hollywood on March 27, 2011, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 1, by [[Universal Pictures]]. During its theatrical run, the film earned $184{{nbsp}}million at the box office. To date, it is the only Illumination film that combines live-action photography with animation.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Easter Island]], a young rabbit named E.B. is intended to succeed his father as the [[Easter Bunny]]. Intimidated by the calling's demands and ignoring his father's orders, E.B. runs away to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer. In [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]], E.B. is hit by Fred O'Hare, an out-of-work, job-hopping slacker who was driving to his sister Sam's boss's house to house-sit, while his parents forced him to move out. Feigning injury, E.B. persuades Fred to take him in as he recovers, but when E.B. causes trouble, Fred attempts to release him in the wilderness. E.B. persuades to help him by claiming to be the Easter Bunny, whom Fred as a child had witnessed delivering eggs.\n\nE.B.'s father sends his royal guards, the Pink Berets, to search for him and bring him back. In Hollywood, E.B. sees the Berets closing in on him and hides inside a business where Fred is having a job interview. E.B. enjoys a successful recording session with [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] as their substitute drummer, but ruins Fred's job interview. In the process, E.B. gets a tip about a possible audition for [[David Hasselhoff]], who invites him to perform on his show.\n\nAfterwards, Fred attends his adoptive younger sister Alex's school Easter pageant with E.B. hiding in a satchel. E.B., alarmed that the Pink Berets have apparently found him due to the three bunny suit shadows on a wall and disgusted by Alex's awful rendition of \"[[Peter Cottontail (song)|Peter Cottontail]]\", dashes out and disrupts the show, forcing Fred to feign a ventriloquist's act with E.B.'s cooperation as his dummy and leading the show in singing, \"[[I Want Candy]]\". Both Fred's father Henry and Alex are angry about the upstaging, but Fred is inspired to be the Easter Bunny himself. Although skeptical, E.B. agrees to train him and finds that Fred has some genuine talent for it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Easter Bunny's [[second-in-command]] Carlos the Chick plots a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against him to take over Easter. Carlos inspires the chicks to uprise the bunnies and begins training to become the Easter Bunny, or, Easter Chick, but seems to lack the qualities an Easter Bunny needs. As the Pink Berets close in on him, E.B. prepares a decoy to fake his death and leaves for Hasselhoff's show. The Berets see the decoy and, horrified that Fred has apparently killed E.B., capture him and take him to Easter Island. Fred is confronted by E.B.'s father and Carlos, however Carlos pretends to be upset about E.B.'s death, silences Fred when he tries to tell the truth, and seizes control of the Easter factory, tying up E.B.'s father and placing him and Fred to be boiled alive. Meanwhile, E.B. starts to feel guilty for acting selfish and leaving Fred, and is convinced by Hasselhoff on his show to go back and help his friend.\n\nE.B. races back to the factory. He confronts Carlos, but is immobilized in gummy candy and tossed into the chocolate bunny carving line. E.B. survives by dodging the blades of the machine, while Fred eats through the black-licorice ropes, escaping with E.B\u2019s father, who couldn\u2019t eat through due to the poor taste of the candy. Carlos, now a chick-bunny combination due to the magic of The Egg of Destiny, battles with E.B. and defeats him easily due to his size. Carlos then tries to lead the Egg Sleigh out with his sidekick Phil directing, but E.B. improvises a drum session that drives Phil to uncontrollably dance to the beat and provide the wrong signals, causing the sleigh to crash and subdue Carlos. E.B. and his father reconcile, and he and Fred are crowned co-Easter bunnies, while Carlos is forced to pull the Egg Sleigh.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast in order of production notes listing:{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=2}}\n\n===Live-action cast actors===\n* [[James Marsden]] as Frederick \"Fred\" O'Hare, an out of work slacker who is trying to find work\n** Coleton Ray as Young Fred\n* [[Kaley Cuoco]] as Samantha \"Sam\" O'Hare, Fred's younger sister\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Henry O'Hare, Fred's father\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Bonnie O'Hare, Fred's mother\n* [[Tiffany Espensen]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" O'Hare, Fred's adoptive younger sister\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Himself, the host of \"Hoff Knows Talent\"\n* [[Chelsea Handler]] as Mrs. Beck, a video game company member and Fred's interviewer\n* [[Dustin Ybarra]] as Cody\n* [[Russell Brand]] as a \"Hoff Knows Talent\" production assistant.\n\n===Voice cast actors===\n* [[Russell Brand]] as E.B., a rabbit who dreams of becoming a drummer rather than following his father's footsteps to be the next Easter Bunny.\n** Django Marsh as Young E.B.\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Carlos, a chick who schemes to take over Easter Island\n** Azaria also voices Phil, Carlos' naive and good-natured sidekick.\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Mr. Bunny (credited as \"E.B.'s Dad\"), E.B.'s father who is the current Easter Bunny.\n* [[Hugh Hefner]] as Voice at Playboy Mansion\n\n==Production==\n===Animation and character design===\nThe animated characters were designed by [[Peter de S\u00e8ve]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Phipps |first=Keith |date=March 31, 2011 |title=''Hop'' |url=https://www.avclub.com/hop-1798167778 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211124090032/https://www.avclub.com/hop-1798167778 |archive-date=November 24, 2021 |access-date=November 24, 2021 |website=[[The A.V.
