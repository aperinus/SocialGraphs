She and her roommate and college professor Kia are in a coffee shop when they run into Ely, a [[hippie]]ish woman with long braided hair, whom Max initially dismisses. Max and Ely do end up going to a film together. After the film they return to Ely's place and, after some flirtatious conversation, they kiss. Suddenly a call comes in from Ely's (unseen on-screen) partner Kate, with whom Ely has been in a long-distance relationship for more than two years, which puts a bit of a damper on things.\n\nEly decides to cut off all her hair, ending up with a very short [[butch and femme|butch]] style. She runs into Max in a bookstore and Max almost does not recognize her.\n\nKia's girlfriend Evy returns home. Her ex-boyfriend Junior is there. Evy's mother confronts her, saying that Junior [[Outing|told her]] that he had spotted Evy at a gay bar. Evy's mother kicks her out and Evy flees to Kia's place and Max invites her to live with them.\n\nEly and her roommate Daria throw a dinner party and, after a spirited game of [[Never have I ever|I Never]], Max and Ely reconnect. They make plans to go out again and then begin kissing. They have several phone conversations, in the course of which Ely reveals that she's \"sort of broken up\" with Kate. They get together for a second date but they never make it out of the apartment. Max ends up trimming Ely's fingernails. This turns into [[foreplay]] and they have sex. Intercut with the closing credits are shots and short scenes of Max and Ely's burgeoning relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Guinevere Turner]] as Camille 'Max' West\n* V.S. Brodie as Ely\n* T.
