It is based on the 1981 [[The Mosquito Coast (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Paul Theroux]]. The film tells the story of a family that leaves the United States and tries to find a happier and simpler life in the jungles of Central America. However, their jungle paradise quickly turns into a [[dystopia]] as their stubborn father's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive. It was shot in the cities of [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]] and [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in addition to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Belize]].\n\n==Plot==\nAllie Fox is a brilliant but stubborn inventor who has grown fed up with the [[American Dream]] and consumerism. Furthermore, he believes that  a nuclear war is on the horizon as a result of American greed and crime. After Allie and his eldest son Charlie acquire the components at a local dump, he finishes assembling his latest creation, an ice machine known as Fat Boy. Allie's boss, Mr. Polski, an asparagus farm owner, complains that Allie is not tending to the asparagus, which is rotting. Allie, Charlie, and Allie's youngest son, Jerry, meet Mr. Polski, and Allie shows him \"Fat Boy.\" The machine leaves Polski unimpressed. As he drives past the fields, a dejected Allie comments on immigrants picking asparagus, and says that where they come from, they might think of ice as a luxury.\n\nThe next morning, Allie throws a party for the immigrant workers before telling his family that they're leaving the United States. On board a [[Panama]]nian barge, the family meets Reverend Spellgood, a missionary, his wife, and their daughter, Emily. Allie and the Reverend clash due to their opposing religious views. When the barge docks in [[Belize City]], the families disembark and go their separate ways. From a drunken German, Allie purchases a small village called Jeronimo located in the rainforest along the river.\n\nMr. Haddy takes Allie and his family upriver to Jeronimo. Allie meets the inhabitants and proceeds to start building a new, \"advanced\" civilization, inventing many new things in the process. The locals take kindly to Allie and his family, but Allie's will to build a [[utopia]]n civilization keeps them working to their limits. Reverend Spellgood arrives to convert Jeronimo's citizens. In the process, Allie and Spellgood angrily denounce each other, leading to a permanent schism: Allie believes Spellgood to be a religious zealot; Spellgood believes Allie to be a communist. Allie sets to constructing a huge version of \"Fat Boy\" that can supply the town with ice. Upon completing the machine, Allie hears rumors of a native tribe in the mountains that has never seen ice. Allie recruits his two sons to carry a load of ice into the jungle to supply the tribe. Upon arriving, Allie finds that the load has melted, and that the tribe has already been visited by missionaries.\n\nWhen Allie returns to Jeronimo, he learns that Spellgood has left with much of the populace, scaring them with stories of God's biblical destruction. The near-empty town is visited by three rebels, who demand to use Jeronimo as a base. Allie and his family agree to accommodate them while Allie concocts a plan to be rid of them. Set on freezing them to death, Allie bunks the rebels up in the giant ice machine, tells Charlie to lock its only other exit, and activates it. The rebels, waking in panic, try to shoot their way out. To Allie's horror, the rebels' gunfire sets off an explosion within the machine. By the next morning, both the machine and the family's home is in ruins, and chemicals from the destroyed machine have severely polluted the river.\n\nForced downstream, Allie and his family arrive at the coast. Mother and the children rejoice, believing they can return to the United States. Allie, refusing to believe his dream has been shattered, announces that they have all they need on the beach and tells them that the United States has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Settling on the beach in a houseboat he has built, and refusing assistance from Mr. Haddy, Allie believes that the family has accomplished building a utopia. One night, the storm surge from a tropical cyclone nearly forces the family out to sea until Charlie reveals that he has been hiding motor components (secretly given to him by Mr. Haddy), allowing them to start the motor on the boat.\n\nForced to travel upstream once again, Charlie and Jerry grow resentful of their father. Coming ashore when the family stumbles across Spellgood's compound, Allie sees barbed wire, and mutters that the settlement is a Christian concentration camp. While the rest of the family sleeps, Charlie and Jerry sneak over to the Spellgood home. They find out that the United States was not destroyed and that Emily will assist them in escaping from Allie. Before Charlie can persuade Mother and his sisters to leave, Allie sets Spellgood's church on fire. Spellgood shoots Allie, paralyzing him from the neck down. The family escapes aboard the boat.\n\nThe family begins traveling downriver again, with Allie drifting in and out of consciousness. Allie asks his wife if they are going upstream. She lies to him for the first time. Charlie's narration reports the death of Allie, but gives hope that the rest of the family can live their lives freely from now on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Allie Fox\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Margot \"Mother\" Fox\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Charlie Fox\n* [[Conrad Roberts]] as Mr. Haddy\n* [[Andre Gregory]] as Reverend Spellgood\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Emily Spellgood\n* Melanie Boland as Mrs. Spellgood\n* [[Dick O'Neill]] as Mr. Polski\n* [[Jadrien Steele]] as Jerry Fox\n* Hilary Gordon as April Fox\n* Rebecca Gordon as Clover Fox\n* Alice Heffernan-Sneed as Mrs. Polski\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Hardware Clerk\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Captain Smalls\n* [[Aurora Clavel]] as Mrs. Maywit\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Mrs. Kennywick\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[Jerome Hellman]] bought the rights to Theroux's novel as soon as it was published, and Weir committed to filming it. [[Jack Nicholson]] was originally offered the lead role, but backed out partly because he could not watch [[Los Angeles Lakers]] games in Belize, where part of the film was to be shot.<ref name=\"duke\">Duke, Brad. ''Harrison Ford: the films''. McFarland, 2005.</ref>\n\nAs the film went into pre-production, and Weir was in Central America scouting for locations, the financial backing for the film fell through and the project was suspended indefinitely.<ref name=\"pfeiffer\">Pfeiffer, Lee. ''The Films of Harrison Ford''. Citadel Press, 2002.</ref> In the meantime, Weir was approached to direct ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' starring Harrison Ford. The film, which was Weir's first American production, was a critical and commercial success, garnering eight [[Academy Award]] nominations including Weir for Best Director, Ford for Best Actor, and the film itself for Best Film. During the production of ''Witness'', Weir discussed ''The Mosquito Coast'' with Ford who became interested in the role of Allie Fox (though Ford's agent was less enthusiastic). With Ford attached to the project, financial backing and distribution for the film was easier to find (ultimately from [[Saul Zaentz]] and [[Warner Bros.]]).<ref name=\"pfeiffer\" />\n\nFilming began the week of February 7, 1986 in Belize and finished there on April 26 before moving to Georgia. Weir and Ford famously missed the Academy Awards ceremony for which they had both been nominated for ''Witness'',<ref name=\"duke\" /> which won two Oscars, for Best Screenplay and Best Film Editing.\n\nThe film contains the last feature film role of [[Butterfly McQueen]], who had a prominent role in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. She plays a lapsed churchgoer, and in real life was a vocal atheist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/news/2009/madison_buscampaign.php|title=Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.|date=December 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205024517/http://ffrf.org/news/2009/madison_buscampaign.php|archive-date=December 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was initially a critical and commercial disappointment, but has since received much stronger modern reviews.
