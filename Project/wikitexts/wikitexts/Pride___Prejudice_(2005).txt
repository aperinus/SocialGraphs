The film features five sisters from an English family of [[landed gentry]] as they deal with issues of marriage, morality and misconceptions. [[Keira Knightley]] stars in the lead role of [[Elizabeth Bennet]], while [[Matthew Macfadyen]] plays her romantic interest [[Mr. Darcy]].\n\nScreenwriter [[Deborah Moggach]] initially attempted to make her script as faithful to the novel as possible, writing from Elizabeth's perspective while preserving much of the original dialogue. Wright encouraged greater deviation from the text, including changing the dynamics within the Bennet family. Wright and Moggach set the film in an earlier period and avoided depicting a \"perfectly clean Regency world\", presenting instead a \"muddy hem version\" of the time. It was shot entirely on location in England on an 11-week schedule.{{sfn|Elley|2005}}{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Wright found casting difficult due to past performances of particular characters. The filmmakers had to balance who they thought was best for each role with the studio's desire for stars. Knightley was well known in part from her role in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series, while Macfadyen had no international name recognition.\n\nProduced by [[Working Title Films]] in association with [[StudioCanal]], ''Pride & Prejudice'' was released on 16 September 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 11 November in the United States. The film's themes emphasise realism, romanticism and family. It was marketed to a younger, mainstream audience; promotional items noted that it came from the producers of 2001's [[romantic comedy]] ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' before acknowledging its provenance as an Austen novel. ''Pride & Prejudice'' earned a worldwide gross of approximately $121 million, a commercial success. It received generally positive reviews, and also received four nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]], including [[Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for 20-year-old Knightley, making her the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 3|third-youngest Best Actress]] nominee at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Renfro|first=Kim|title=The 31 youngest Oscar nominees of all time|url=https://www.insider.com/youngest-oscar-nominees-2018-2|access-date=2021-04-17|website=Insider|language=en-US|archive-date=12 February 2020|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20200212223412/https://www.insider.com/youngest-oscar-nominees-2018-2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Evry|first=Max|title=The 25 Youngest Oscar Nominees of All Time|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/2802405/youngest-oscar-nominees-winners-of-all-time/|access-date=2021-04-17|website=MTV News|language=en|archive-date=20 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420163843/https://www.mtv.com/news/2802405/youngest-oscar-nominees-winners-of-all-time/|url-status=live}}</ref> Austen scholars have opined that Wright's work created a new hybrid genre by blending traditional traits of the [[heritage film]] with \"youth-oriented filmmaking techniques\".{{sfn|Dole|2007}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the late 18th century, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their daughters \u2013 Jane, [[Elizabeth Bennet|Elizabeth]], Mary, Kitty, and Lydia \u2013 live at Longbourn, their estate in rural [[England]]. Mrs. Bennet, eager to secure suitable marriages for her daughters, is delighted when wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley moves into nearby Netherfield. At an [[assembly rooms|assembly]] [[ball (dance)|ball]], Bingley, his sister, Caroline, and his friend [[Mr. Darcy]] meet the local society. Bingley and Jane are immediately taken with each other, while Elizabeth instantly dislikes the snobbish Darcy and overhears his dismissive remarks about her.\n\nLater, visiting the Bingleys, Jane falls ill and must stay to recuperate. While Elizabeth is visiting Jane at Netherfield, she verbally spars with the haughty Caroline and the aloof Darcy. Jane recovers and soon after, Mr. Bennet's cousin, [[Mr. William Collins|Mr. Collins]], a pompous clergyman, visits the Bennets; as the closest male relative, Collins will inherit Longbourn. Mr. Collins intends to propose to Jane, but Mrs. Bennet says she will soon be engaged; she suggests Elizabeth, which Collins considers an agreeable alternative. The Bennet sisters also meet the handsome and charming soldier, [[George Wickham|Lieutenant Wickham]], who is connected to the Darcy family. He wins Elizabeth's sympathy by claiming Mr. Darcy denied him his rightful inheritance.\n\nAt the Netherfield ball, Elizabeth dances with Darcy, though the encounter is strained. The next day, Collins proposes to Elizabeth, who soundly rejects him; despite her mother's anger, her father supports her decision. The Bingley party unexpectedly return to [[London]]. Elizabeth urges Jane to visit their aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, who live in London, hoping she reconnects with Bingley. Elizabeth is astonished when her friend, Charlotte, fearing [[spinster]]hood, announces her engagement to Mr. Collins.\n\nMonths later, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins, who reside on [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]'s estate. Elizabeth unexpectedly meets Darcy, who is Lady Catherine's nephew, and is visiting with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Unaware that Jane is Elizabeth's sister, Fitzwilliam mentions that Darcy recently untangled Bingley from an imprudent match with an \"unsuitable\" family.\n\nDistraught, Elizabeth is then met by Darcy, who surprisingly proposes marriage, declaring his ardent love despite her inferior rank. Offended and angry, she refuses him. He defends separating Jane and Bingley, believing Jane indifferent, and rightly criticizes the other Bennets' occasional social impropriety. Elizabeth also cites his mistreating Wickham. Angry and heartbroken, Darcy later delivers Elizabeth a letter describing Wickham's true character: Wickham squandered the bequest Darcy's father left him, then attempted to seduce Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, into eloping to gain her fortune.\n\nElizabeth returns home, as does Jane. Accompanying the Gardiners on a trip to the [[Peak District]], Elizabeth reluctantly tours [[Pemberley]], the grand Darcy estate. She unexpectedly runs into Darcy, who invites her and the Gardiners to dine at Pemberley. Darcy's manner has softened considerably, his manners impressing the Gardiners, and Georgiana sharing her brother's flattering reports about Elizabeth.\n\nAn urgent letter from Jane reveals that Lydia has run off with Wickham. Darcy leaves abruptly, and Elizabeth returns home, certain she will never see Darcy again. Her mother fears Lydia's disgrace will ruin her other daughters' chances for good marriages. After a tense waiting period, Mr. Gardiner sends news that Lydia and Wickham are now married, and the newlyweds return to Longbourn. Lydia lets slip to Elizabeth that it was Darcy who found them and paid for their wedding. He also purchased Wickham's [[purchase of commissions in the British Army|military commission]].\n\nBingley and Darcy return to Netherfield and visit Longbourn; Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Late that night, Lady Catherine arrives to see Elizabeth and demands she never become engaged to Darcy because, she claims, Darcy has been engaged to marry Lady Catherine's daughter since infancy; deeply insulted, Elizabeth orders her to leave. Walking the moor early the next morning, Elizabeth encounters Darcy, who apologizes for his aunt's intrusion. He professes his continued love, and Elizabeth, her feelings radically altered, accepts his proposal. She tells her father the truth of Darcy's actions, and Mr. Bennet gives Elizabeth his consent to marry, overjoyed she has found love.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet|Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" Bennet]]\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[Mr. Darcy]]\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as [[Bennet family#Mrs. Bennet|Mrs. Bennet]]\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Bennet family#Mr. Bennet|Mr. Bennet]]\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as [[Mr. William Collins|Mr. Collins]]\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as [[Bennet family#Jane Bennet|Jane Bennet]]\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as [[Bennet family#Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet|Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet]]\n* [[Jena Malone]] as [[Bennet family#Lydia Bennet|Lydia Bennet]]\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as [[Bennet family#Mary Bennet|Mary Bennet]]\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]\n* [[Simon Woods]] as Charles Bingley\n* [[Tamzin Merchant]] as Georgiana Darcy\n* [[Claudie Blakley]] as Charlotte Lucas\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Caroline Bingley\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as [[George Wickham]]\n* [[Cornelius Booth]] as Colonel Fitzwilliam\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Mrs. Gardiner\n* [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as Mr. Gardiner\n* [[Meg Wynn Owen]] as Mrs. Reynolds\n* [[Sinead Matthews]] as Betsy\n* [[Roy Holder]] as Mr. Hill\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\nAs with several recent [[Jane Austen]] adaptations, ''Pride & Prejudice'' was an Anglo-American collaboration, between British studio [[Working Title Films]] (in association with French company [[StudioCanal]]) and its American parent company [[Universal Studios]].{{sfn|Elley|2005}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p = 170}} Working Title at the time was known for mainstream productions like ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' and ''[[Love Actually]]'' that drew international audiences,{{sfn|Durgan|2007}} rather than films in the historical drama genre.{{sfn|Troost|2007|p = 86}} Its co-chairman [[Tim Bevan]] explained that the studio wanted to \"bring Austen's original story, concentrating on [[Elizabeth Bennet|Lizzie]], back in all its glory to the big screen for audiences everywhere to enjoy\".{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Given a \"relatively inexpensive\" budget of \u00a322 million ($28 million),{{sfn|British Film Institute}}{{sfn|The Numbers}} the film was expected to excel at the box office, particularly based on the commercial successes of ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996) and ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' (1998) as well as the resurgence of interest in Austen's [[Jane Austen#List of works|works]].{{sfn|Andrew|2011|p = 31}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p = 166}}\n\n[[File:Deborah Moggach.jpg|thumb|Screenwriter [[Deborah Moggach]] changed the film's period setting to the late 18th century partly out of concern that it would be overshadowed by the [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|1995 BBC adaptation]].{{sfn|Cartmell|2010|p = 85}}]]\nGiven little instruction from the studio, screenwriter [[Deborah Moggach]] spent over two years adapting ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' for film. She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts.{{sfn|Spunberg|2011}}{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} Realising it held \"a perfect three-act structure\",{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it \"so beautifully shaped as a story \u2013 the ultimate romance about two people who think they hate each other but who are really passionately in love. I felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'\"{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} While she could not reproduce the novel's \"fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety\", she attempted to keep much of it.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}\n\nMoggach's first script was closest to Austen's book, but later versions trimmed extraneous storylines and characters.{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} Moggach initially wrote all scenes from Elizabeth's point of view in keeping with the novel; she later set a few scenes from the male perspective, such as when Bingley practices his marriage proposal, to \"show Darcy and Bingley being close\" and to indicate Darcy was a \"human being instead of being stuck up\".{{sfn|Spunberg|2011}} Small details were inserted that acknowledged wider events outside of the characters' circle, such as those then occurring in France.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} While Moggach is the only screenwriter credited for the film, playwright [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]] also made early additions to the script.{{sfn|Wells|2007}}{{sfn|Dawtrey|2004}}\n\nTelevision director [[Joe Wright]] was hired in early 2004,{{sfn|Dawtrey|2004}} making ''Pride & Prejudice'' his feature film directorial debut.{{sfn|Holden|2005}} He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the [[Romance film|romance]] [[Drama film|drama]] genre due to his past work with [[social realism]].{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p = 171}} Wright's body of work had impressed the producers,{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} who were looking for a fresh perspective;{{sfn|Durgan|2007}} they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}{{sfn|DeGennaro|2005}} He commented that at the time, \"I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it\".{{sfn|Fetters}} He next read the novel, which he called \"an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people&nbsp;... things like that.\"{{sfn|Fetters}}\n{{Quote box\n| quote=\"I wanted to make something that is about young people, about young people experiencing these emotions for the first time and not understanding the feelings they are having. If you have a 40-year-old man as your star not understanding the feeling he's having then it becomes a bit unbelievable and suspect, rather like ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' or something instead of ''Pride & Prejudice''\".\n| source = \u2014 Director Joe Wright commenting on the ages of the actors in the 1940 adaptation{{sfn|Fetters}}\n| width = 30em\n| align = left\n| bgcolor = #FFFFF0\n}}\nThe only adaptation of ''Pride and Prejudice'' Wright had seen was the [[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|1940 production]], which was the last time the novel had been adapted into a feature film. The director purposely did not watch the [[Pride and Prejudice#Film, television and theatre|other productions]], both out of fear he would inadvertently steal ideas and because he wanted to be as original as possible.{{sfn|Fetters}} He did, however, watch other period films, including [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'', [[Roger Michell]]'s ''[[Persuasion (1995 film)|Persuasion]]'', and [[John Schlesinger]]'s ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd (1967 film)|Far from the Madding Crowd]]''; Wright cited this last film as the greatest influence on his own adaptation, calling it \"very real and very honest \u2013 and it is quite romantic as well\".{{sfn|Haun|2005}} In trying to create an atmosphere of charged flirtation, the director also gained inspiration from teen romance films such as ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''{{sfn|Austen|2008}} and ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 10:00\u201310:40}}\n\nWright's hire occurred while Moggach was on her third draft.{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} Despite her desire to work closely with Austen's dialogue, Wright made an effort to not \"be too reverential to [it]. I don't believe people spoke like that then; it's not natural.\"{{sfn|DeGennaro|2005}} While a few scenes, such as the discussion over accomplished women, aligned closely with the author's original dialogue, many others \"substituted instead a mixture of modern idiom and archaic-sounding sentence structure\".{{sfn|Wells|2007|}} One alteration concerned politeness; Wright noted that while Austen's work had characters waiting before speaking, he believed that \"particularly in big families of girls, everyone tends to speak over each other, finishing each other's sentences, etc. So I felt that the Bennet family's conversations would be overlapping like that.\"{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} ''Sense and Sensibility'' actress and screenwriter [[Emma Thompson]] aided in script development, though she opted to be uncredited. She advised the nervous director about adapting Austen for the screen and made dialogue recommendations, such as with parts of the Collins-Charlotte storyline.{{sfn|Hewitt|2005}}{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 55:30\u201355:44}}\n\nCiting the year Austen first wrote a draft of the novel,{{#tag:ref|Austen wrote a draft of ''First Impressions'' (later renamed ''Pride and Prejudice'') between October 1796 and August 1797.{{sfn|Silvers|Olsen|2011|p=191}}|group=\"note\"}} Wright and Moggach changed the period setting from 1813 (the novel's publication date) to the late eighteenth century; this decision was partly because Wright wanted to highlight the differences within an England influenced by the [[French Revolution]],{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}{{sfn|DeGennaro|2005}} as he was fascinated that it had \"caused an atmosphere among the British aristocracy of fear\".{{sfn|Haun|2005}} Additionally, Wright chose the earlier period because he hated dresses with an [[empire silhouette]], which were popular in the later period.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}{{sfn|DeGennaro|2005}} The decision helped make the film visually distinct from other recent Austen adaptations.{{sfn|Austen|2008}} In comparison to the popular [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|1995 BBC version]], which featured [[Colin Firth]] and [[Jennifer Ehle]], producer [[Paul Webster (producer)|Paul Webster]] desired to make an adaptation that \"doesn't conform to the television drama stereotypes of a perfect clean Regency world\".{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Wright and Moggach opted for a \"muddy hem version\" of Longbourn, presenting a more rural setting than in previous adaptations{{sfn|Cartmell|2010|p = 11}}{{sfn|Spunberg|2011}} out of a desire to depict the Bennets in \"very close proximity to their rural life\"{{sfn|DeGennaro|2005}} and to emphasise their relative poverty.{{sfn|Cartmell|2010|p = 86}} While the degree of poverty was criticised by some critics, Wright felt that the \"mess adds to the drama of the predicament that the family were in\", and helps contrast the Bennets, Darcys, and Bingleys.{{sfn|Woodworth|2007}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{See also|Pride and Prejudice#Characters|l1=Characters of Pride and Prejudice}}\n\nWright found casting of the film to be difficult because he was very particular about \"the types of people [he] wanted to work with\".{{sfn|Fetters}} While interviewing to direct, he insisted that the actors match the ages of the characters in the novel.{{sfn|Haun|2005}} Wright specifically cast actors that had rapport on and off screen, and insisted that they partake in three weeks of rehearsal in improvisation workshops.{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} Wright also had to balance who he thought was best for each role with what the producers wanted \u2013 mainly a big name attraction.{{sfn|Fetters}} Though Wright had not initially pictured someone as attractive as English actress [[Keira Knightley]] for the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet,{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}} he cast her after realising that the actress \"is really a tomboy [and] has a lively mind and a great sense of humour\".{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Knightley at the time was known for ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' and the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.{{sfn|Austen|2008}} She had been an Austen fan since age 7, but initially feared taking the role out of apprehension that she would be doing \"an absolute copy of Jennifer Ehle's performance\", which she deeply admired.{{sfn|Rojas Weiss|2005}} Knightley believed Elizabeth is \"what you aspire to be: she's funny, she's witty and intelligent. She's a fully rounded and very much loved character.\"{{sfn|Lee|2005}} For the period, the actress studied etiquette, history and dancing but ran into trouble when she acquired a short haircut while preparing for her role in the bounty hunter film ''[[Domino (2005 film)|Domino]]''.{{sfn|Rojas Weiss|2005}}\n\n[[File:Bust of Matthew Macfadyen as Fitzwilliam Darcy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of [[Mr. Darcy]] played by [[Matthew Macfadyen]]. [[Keira Knightley]]'s name recognition allowed the casting of Macfadyen, who was little known internationally.]]\nWebster found the casting of Darcy especially hard due to the character's iconic status and because \"Colin Firth cast a very long shadow\" as the 1995 Darcy.{{sfn|Alberge|2004}} Wright later commented that his choice of Knightley allowed him to cast comparative unknown [[Matthew Macfadyen]], something that would have been impossible had he chosen a less well-known actress for Elizabeth Bennet.{{sfn|Fetters}} Macfadyen at the time was known for his role in the British television spy series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'',{{sfn|Alberge|2004}} but had no recognition internationally.{{sfn|Austen|2008}} A fan of the actor's television work,{{sfn|Haun|2005}} Wright called Macfadyen \"a proper manly man&nbsp;... I didn't want a pretty boy kind of actor. His properties were the ones I felt I needed [for Darcy]. Matthew's a great big hunk of a guy.\"{{sfn|Fetters}}\n\nAccording to Wright, [[Rosamund Pike]] was cast as the eldest sister \"because [he] knew she wasn't going to play her as a nice, simple person. Jane has a real interior world, she has her heart broken.\"{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}} Despite being Pike's ex-boyfriend, [[Simon Woods]] was cast as her romantic interest Mr Bingley.{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}} The other three Bennet sisters were played by [[Talulah Riley]], [[Carey Mulligan]], and [[Jena Malone]], the only American actress among them.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Wright believed Malone to have a \"pretty faultless English accent\".{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 4:10\u20134:35}} Mulligan heard about the casting call at a dinner hosted by [[Julian Fellowes]], to whom she had written a letter after failing to get into drama school; she won the part after three auditions.{{sfn|Hall|2010}} [[Tamzin Merchant]] appears as Georgiana Darcy; she was hired despite having no previous acting experience after she wrote a letter to the casting director.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} In addition to Merchant, ''Pride & Prejudice'' was the feature film debut of both Mulligan{{sfn|Roberts|2010}} and Riley.{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|loc = 3:10\u20133:20}}\n\n[[Donald Sutherland]] reminded Wright of his own father and was cast as the Bennet patriarch;{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 4:10\u20134:35}} Wright thought the actor possessed the \"strength to handle those six women\".{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}} [[Brenda Blethyn]] was hired to play Mrs Bennet, whom Moggach believed to be the unsung heroine of the film;{{sfn|Cartmell|2010|p = 63}} Wright explained that it was \"a tricky part [to fill], as she can be very annoying; you want to stop her chattering and shrieking. But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters.\"{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Wright convinced veteran actress [[Judi Dench]] to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read \"I love it when you play a bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me.\"{{sfn|Dole|2007}}{{sfn|Hoggard|2005}} Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.{{sfn|Hewitt|2005}}{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 1:00:05\u20131:00:15}}\n\n=== Costume design ===\n[[File:Pride & Prejudice (2005) Bennet sisters screenshot.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jacqueline Durran]] designed the Bennet sisters' costumes based on their characters' specific characteristics. From left: Mary, Elizabeth, Jane, Mrs Bennet, Kitty and Lydia.]]\nKnown for her [[BAFTA award]]-winning work on the 2004 film ''[[Vera Drake]]'', [[Jacqueline Durran]] was hired as the costume designer. She and Wright approached his film \"as a difficult thing to tackle\" because of their desire to distinguish it from the television adaptation. Due to Wright's dislike of the high waistline, Durran focused on later [[1795\u20131820 in fashion|eighteenth century fashions]] that often included a [[corset]]ed, natural waistline rather than an [[empire silhouette]] (which became popular after the 1790s).{{sfn|Robey|2006}} A generational divide was established: the older characters dress in mid-eighteenth century fashions while the young wear \"a sort of proto-[[British Regency|Regency]] style of hair and dress\".{{sfn|Tandy|2007}}\n\nDurran's costumes also helped emphasise social rank among the different characters;{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 23:40\u201324:00}} Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been at the height of fashion.{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 7:30\u20137:40}} During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her.{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 35:10\u201335:30}} Costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.{{sfn|Demory|2010|p = 134}}\n\nTo help differentiate the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the \"tomboy\", clothing her in earthy colours because of her love of the countryside.{{sfn|Robey|2006}} For the other sisters, Durran remarked, \"Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee in a kind of teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two.\"{{sfn|Robey|2006}} In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses.{{sfn|Cartmell|2010|p = 86}}\n\nMr Darcy's costume went through a series of phases. Durran noted: {{Blockquote|The first time we see him he's at Meriton {{sic}}, where he has a very stiffly tailored jacket on and he's quite contained and rigid. He stays in that rigid form for the first part of the film. By the time we get to the proposal that goes wrong in the rain, we move to a similar cut, but a much softer fabric. And then later he's got a completely different cut of coat, not interlined and he wears it undone. The nth degree is him walking through the mist in the morning, completely undressed by 18th-century standards. It's absolutely unlikely, but then Lizzie's in her nightie, so what can you say?{{sfn|Robey|2006}} }}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Filming Pride and Prejudice in Stamford Lincolnshire - geograph.org.uk - 61717.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] represented the fictional village of Meryton.{{sfn|Focus Features Locations|2005}} {{small|(Filming of the militia pictured)}}]]\nMoggach believed the novel was very filmable, \"despite it containing no description and being a very unvisual book\".{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} To Wright, many other period films had relied on paintings for inspiration rather than photographs, causing them to appear unreal. He thus used \"Austen's prose [to give him] many visual references for the people in the story\", including using close-up shots of various characters.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} The filmmakers also changed several scenes to more romantic locales than those in the book. For instance, in the film, Darcy first proposes outdoors in a rainstorm at a building with [[neoclassical architecture]]; in the book, this scene takes place inside a parsonage. In the film, his second proposal occurs on the misty moors as dawn breaks;{{sfn|Chan|2007}}{{sfn|Gymnich|Ruhl|Scheunemann|2010|p = 40}} in the book, he and Elizabeth are walking down a country lane in broad daylight.{{sfn|Austen|2006|pp = 392\u201396}} Wright has acknowledged that \"there are a lot of period film clich\u00e9s; some of them are in the film and some are not, but for me it was important to question them\".{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}\n[[File:Pride & Prejudice Exhibit (6319832859).jpg|left|thumb|''Pride & Prejudice'' exhibition in [[Basildon Park]], which was used as the location of Netherfield, home of George Bingley]]\n[[File:Groombridge Place 1.jpg|left|thumb|[[Groombridge Place]] served as the filming location of the Bennet family house]]\nDuring script development, the crew created a \"constant going back and forth between script and location\".{{sfn|Hanson|2005}} The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule{{sfn|Elley|2005}}{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} during the 2004 summer.{{sfn|Knightley|2005|loc = 1:25\u20131:30}} Co-producer Paul Webster noted that \"it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe [Wright]'s idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment.\"{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} Working under [[production designer]] [[Sarah Greenwood]] and [[set decorator]] [[Katie Spencer]], the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because \"nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century\", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming.{{sfn|Whitlock|2010|p = 304}} Visual effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.{{sfn|Desowitz|2005}}\n\nProduction staff selected particularly grand-looking residences to better convey the wealth and power of certain characters.{{sfn|Silvers|Olsen|2011|p = 194}} Locations included [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], the largest privately held country house in England with its spectacular rooms frescoed by [[Antonio Verrio]].

The soundtrack is performed by the French pianist [[Jean-Yves Thibaudet]] accompanied by the [[English Chamber Orchestra]].\n\nThe early [[piano sonata]]s of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] \"became a point of reference\" and \"starting point\" for the original score.{{sfn|Goldwasser|2006}} Some pieces were inspired by the film's period,{{sfn|O'Brien}} with the assumption that they could conceivably have been heard during that time and contained actual dance cues that were fitting for the late eighteenth century. Pieces that actors perform were composed first, before filming began.\n\nThe soundtrack ultimately contained seventeen instrumental tracks of music organised in a different way from the film.{{sfn|O'Brien}}\n\n=== Editing ===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = You have to be true to the integrity of the book and to Jane Austen, but then you also have to be quite ruthless.

After watching a preview of the film before its wide release, former JASNA president Elsa Solender commented, \"It has nothing at all of Jane Austen in it, is inconsistent with the first two-thirds of the film, insults the audience with its banality and ought to be cut before release\".{{sfn|Wloszczyna|2005}} It had been removed from the British version after preview audiences found it unintentionally humorous;{{sfn|Brownstein|2011|pp = 53}} however, later audiences complained that they were excluded from viewing this version, causing the film to be re-released in the UK and Ireland 10 weeks after the original UK premiere date.{{sfn|Dawson Edwards|2008|p = 1}}{{sfn|Working Title Films|2005d}} The original British version ended with Mr Bennet's blessing upon Elizabeth and Darcy's union,{{sfn|Dole|2007}} thus circumventing the last chapter in the novel, which summarises the lives of the Darcys and the other main characters over the next several years.{{sfn|Austen|2006|pp = 403\u201305}}\n\n== Major themes and analysis ==\n\n=== Romanticism and realism ===\nFilm, literary, and Austen scholars noted the appearance of romance and [[romanticism]] within ''Pride & Prejudice'', especially in comparison to previous adaptations.{{sfn|Demory|2010|p = 132}} Sarah Ailwood marked the film as \"an essentially Romantic interpretation of Austen's novel\", citing as evidence Wright's attention to nature as a means to \"position Elizabeth and Darcy as Romantic figures&nbsp;... Wright's ''Pride & Prejudice'' takes as its central focus Austen's concern with exploring the nature of the Romantic self and the possibilities for women and men to achieve individual self-fulfillment within an oppressive patriarchal social and economic order.\"{{sfn|Ailwood|2007}} Likewise, Catherine Stewart-Beer of [[Oxford Brookes University]] called Elizabeth's presence on the Derbyshire cliff a \"stunning, magical evocation of Wright's strong stylistic brand of Postmodern Romanticism\", but found this less like Austen and more reminiscent of [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.{{sfn|Stewart-Beer|2007}} In her analysis, [[University of Provence]] scholar Lydia Martin concluded that the \"Romantic bias of the film is shown through the shifts in the characters' relationships, the soundtrack and the treatment of landscape\".{{sfn|Martin|2007}}\n\nRealism is a prominent aspect of the film, a theme confirmed by Wright in interviews as well as the DVD audio commentary.{{sfn|Paquet-Deyris|2007}} In a 2007 article, [[Ursinus College]] film studies professor Carole Dole argued that ''Pride & Prejudice'' is \"a hybrid that embraces both an irreverent realism to which younger audiences are accustomed (and which reflects the director's realist aesthetic) and the classic [[heritage film]]'s reverence for country houses, attractive landscapes and authentic period detail\". Such \"irreverent realism\" included the depiction of Longbourn as a working farm complete with chickens, cattle and pigs; as Dole explains, \"The agricultural realities of 1790s England are equally evident in the enclosed yard with barn and hay where Lizzie twirls barefoot over the mud on a rope swing\". Referring to recent adaptations such as 1999's gritty ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'', Dole cited ''Pride & Prejudice'' as evidence that the heritage film is still around but has \"been transformed into a more flexible genre\".{{sfn|Dole|2007}} Jessica Durgan agreed with this assessment, writing that the film \"simultaneously reject[s] and embrac[es] heritage to attract a larger audience\".{{sfn|Durgan|2007}}\n\n=== Family ===\nRaised with three sisters, Moggach was particularly interested in the story's family dynamics.{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}} [[Brock University]] professor Barbara K. Seeber believed that in contrast to the novel, the 2005 adaptation emphasises the familial over the romantic. Evidence of this can be seen in how ''Pride & Prejudice'' \"significantly recast the Bennet family, in particular its patriarch, presenting Mr Bennet as a sensitive and kind father whose role in the family's misfortunes is continually downplayed.\"{{sfn|Seeber|2007}} Seeber further observed that the film is \"the first to present Mrs Bennet in a sympathetic light\", with Mr Bennet displayed as \"an attentive husband as well as a loving father.\"{{sfn|Seeber|2007}}\n\nStewart-Beer and Austen scholar Sally B. Palmer noted alterations within the depiction of the Bennet family;{{sfn|Palmer|2007}} Stewart-Beer remarked that while their family home \"might be chaotic, in this version it is, at heart, a happy home\u2014much happier and much less dysfunctional, than Austen's original version of Longbourn&nbsp;... For one, Mr and Mrs Bennet actually seem to like each other, even love each other, a characterisation which is a far cry from the source text.\"{{sfn|Stewart-Beer|2007}} Producer Paul Webster acknowledged the familial theme in the DVD featurette \"A Bennet Family Portrait\", remarking \"Yes, it's a great love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but underpinning it all is the kind of love that runs this family.\"{{sfn|Seeber|2007}}\n\n=== Depiction of Elizabeth Bennet ===\nWright intended for the film to be \"as subjective as possible\" in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does.{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 6:40\u20136:55}} This focus on Elizabeth features some dramatic changes from the novel. Knightley's Elizabeth has an \"increasingly aloof and emotionally distant\" relationship with her family. Evidence of this can be seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events.{{sfn|Stewart-Beer|2007}} Wright wanted to create a \"real\" relationship between the two sisters and have them grow apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too \"syrupy.\"{{sfn|Wright|2005|loc = 14:00\u201314:30}} Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to \"keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden to her&nbsp;... As she keeps all this to herself, we feel for her more and more. The truest comedy, I believe, is born from pain.\"{{sfn|Focus Features Production|2005}}\n\nIn her \"feisty, impassioned\" interactions with Darcy and \"rebellious refusal to 'perform'\" for Lady Catherine, Stewart-Beer sees Knightley's depiction as \"far removed from Austen's original Elizabeth, who has a greater sense of grounded maturity, even though both Elizabeths have an occasional inclination to fluster, fun and giggles.\"{{sfn|Stewart-Beer|2007}} According to [[George Washington University]] professor Laurie Kaplan, while Wright's focus on Elizabeth is consistent with the novel, the screenplay removed her line of self-recognition: \"Till this moment, I never knew myself\". Kaplan characterises the sentence as Elizabeth's \"most important\", and believes its deletion \"violates not only the spirit and the essence of Austen's story but the viewer's expectations as well.\"{{sfn|Kaplan|2007}}\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Marketing ===\nAfter a string of Jane Austen semi-adaptions in the late 1990s and early 2000s,{{#tag:ref|Recent Austen adaptations included ''[[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1999), ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (2001), ''[[Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy]]'' (2003), and ''[[Bride and Prejudice]]'' (2004).{{sfn|Higson|2011|pp=161\u201370}}|group=\"note\"}} ''Pride & Prejudice'' was positioned to take audiences \"back into the world of period drama and what many saw as a more authentic version of Austen.\"{{sfn|Higson|2011|p = 170}} While the novel was known to audiences, the large number of related productions required the film to distinguish itself.{{sfn|Dawson Edwards|2008|p = 4}} It was marketed to attract mainstream, young viewers,{{sfn|Troost|2007|p = 87}} with one observer referring to it as \"the ultimate chick-flick romance\" and \"more commercial than previous big-screen Austen adaptations.\"{{sfn|Higson|2011|p = 172}} Another wrote that it brings \"millennial girlhood to the megaplex&nbsp;...

Lydia Martin wrote that in contrast to past ''Pride and Prejudice'' productions, marketing materials downplayed the \"suggested antagonism between the heroes\" in favour of highlighting a \"romantic relationship\", as can be seen with the positioning of the characters as well as with the tagline, \"Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is the one you can't be without.\"{{sfn|Martin|2007}}\n\n=== Box office ===\nOn 11 September 2005, ''Pride & Prejudice'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] as a special Gala Presentation.{{sfn|MTV|2005}}{{sfn|Working Title Films|2005a}} The film was released in cinemas on 16 September in the United Kingdom and Ireland.{{sfn|Papamichael|2005}}{{sfn|Working Title Films|2005b}} It achieved the number one spot in its first week, earning \u00a32.5 million ($4.6 million) while playing on 397 screens.{{sfn|Working Title Films|2005c}}{{sfn|Box Office Mojo International Box Office}}{{sfn|UK Film Council|}} The film stayed at the top for two more weeks, earning by then a total of over \u00a39 million at the UK box office.

JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]''.{{sfn|Camden|2007}}{{sfn|Camden|Ford|2007}}{{sfn|Copeland|McMaster|2011|p = 257}}\n\n''Pride & Prejudice'' impacted later productions in the costume drama and heritage film genres. Literary critics protested that Wright's adaptation effectively \"popularized Austen's celebrated romance and brought her novel to the screen as an easy visual read for an undemanding mainstream audience.\"{{sfn|Sabine|2008}} Carole Dole noted that the film's success \"only made it more likely that future adaptations of Austen will feature, if not necessarily mud, then at least youthful and market-tested performers and youth-oriented filmmaking techniques balanced with the visual pleasures of the heritage film.\" She cited [[Anne Hathaway]] in the 2007 film ''[[Becoming Jane]]'' as an example.{{sfn|Dole|2007}} Jessica Durgan added that ''Pride & Prejudice'' conceived a new hybrid genre by rejecting the visual cues of the heritage film, which attracted \"youth and mainstream audiences without alienating the majority of heritage fans.\"{{sfn|Durgan|2007}}\n\nProduction of ''Pride & Prejudice'' began Wright's relationship with Working Title Films, the first of four collaborations.{{sfn|Working Title Films|2011}} Many members of the film's cast and crew joined Wright in his later directorial efforts. For his adaptation of ''Atonement'', which he viewed as \"a direct reaction to ''Pride & Prejudice''\",{{sfn|Wloszczyna|2007}} Wright hired Knightley, Blethyn, Marianelli, Thibaudet, Greenwood, and Durran.{{sfn|Wells|2008|p = 110}} ''Atonement'' employed themes similar to Austen's, including the notion of a young writer living in \"an isolated [[English country house]]\" who \"mixes up desires and fantasies, truths and fiction.\"{{sfn|Brownstein|2011|pp = 53}} Wright's 2009 film ''[[The Soloist]]'' included Hollander, Malone, and Marianelli,{{sfn|Monger}}{{sfn|Bradshaw|2009}}{{sfn|Pham|2010}} while Hollander was also featured in ''[[Hanna (film)|Hanna]]'' (2011).{{sfn|McCarthy|2011}} Wright's [[Anna Karenina (2012 film)|2012 adaptation]] of ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' features Knightley, Macfadyen, Marianelli, Durran, and Greenwood and is produced by Bevan, [[Eric Fellner]], and Webster.{{sfn|Working Title Films|2011}}\n\nOn 11 December 2017, [[Netflix]] announced that a person from Chile watched the film 278 times during the entire year.{{sfn|Villa|2017}} It was later reported that the person was a 51-year-old woman, who declared herself as \"obsessed\" with the film and saw Elizabeth Bennet as \"a feminist icon\".{{sfn|Guti\u00e9rrez|2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jane Austen in popular culture]]\n* [[Janeite]]\n* [[List of literary adaptations of Pride and Prejudice|List of literary adaptations of ''Pride and Prejudice'']]\n* [[2005 in film]]\n* [[List of British films of 2005]]\n* [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 3|List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees \u2013 Youngest nominees for Best Actress in a Leading Role]]\n* [[78th Academy Awards]]\n* [[63rd Golden Globe Awards]]\n* [[59th British Academy Film Awards]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n==== Books ====\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=True to the Spirit: Film Adaptation and the Question of Fidelity |last=Andrew|first=Dudley |publisher=Oxford University Press |others=Colin MacCabe, Rick Warner, Kathleen Murray (editors) |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-537467-4|pages=27\u201340 |chapter=The Economies of Adaptation|author-link=Dudley Andrew }}\n* {{cite book|title=Jane Austen: Complete and Unabridged |last=Austen |first=Jane |publisher=Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc |others=Sarah S.G.
