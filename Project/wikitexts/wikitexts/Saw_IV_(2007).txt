It is the fourth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]], the third directed by Bousman. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Scott Patterson]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], and [[Lyriq Bent]]. The plot follows Daniel Rigg, a police officer obsessed with rescuing the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s victims, who finds himself the focus of Jigsaw's latest series of tests, in which he must rescue his partners, [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and [[Mark Hoffman]], while learning to overcome his obsession. The film also explores John Kramer's legacy and his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work after his death, while providing more of his backstory and an additional explanation as to why he became Jigsaw.\n\n''Saw IV'' was the first film in the franchise to not be written by [[Leigh Whannell]]. It was released by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] in the United States on October 26, 2007, and received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $139 million worldwide. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw V]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nAn [[autopsy]] of the Jigsaw Killer reveals a wax-coated [[microcassette]] in his stomach. The tape shows Detective Hoffman promising that \"the games have just begun.\" In a [[mausoleum]], Trevor and Art are chained to a large device. Trevor's eyes have been sewn together, and Art's mouth has been sewn shut, making communication between them impossible. When the device begins pulling them together, they panic, and Art murders Trevor to retrieve a key from his collar.\n\nMeanwhile, the police discover the corpse of [[Allison Kerry|Detective Kerry]]. After cautioning [[Rigg (Saw)|Lieutenant Rigg]] for barging through an unsecured door, Hoffman is introduced to FBI Agents Strahm and Perez, who deduce that [[Amanda Young]], Jigsaw's apprentice, would need assistance with Kerry's death, indicating that there is another.\n\nThat evening, Rigg and Hoffman are kidnapped. Rigg is told that [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Matthews]] is in fact still alive, and is given ninety minutes to save him. He is then given his first test, where he finds Brenda is slowly being scalped. He rescues her, although he is warned not to, and Brenda later attempts to stab Rigg; Rigg subdues her and learns that Brenda was told that Rigg was there to arrest her for [[prostitution]].\n\nRigg's next test is at a motel, where he is instructed to abduct the manager, Ivan, revealed to be a serial rapist. Angered by seeing videos of Ivan's exploits, Rigg forces Ivan into a prearranged trap, which dismembers him. Rigg's next test occurs in a school where Rigg attacked a man acquitted of abusing his family, though Rigg's career was saved by Hoffman. In one of the classrooms, Rigg discovers the husband and wife impaled on a pole, with the man dead and the woman clinging to life. Rigg tells the woman that she must remove the spikes herself before leaving, pulling a fire alarm as he does.\n\nStrahm and Perez arrive on the scene, where it is learned that all of the victims were defended by Art, who is also the lawyer of Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's ex-wife. After a photographer is accidentally killed on the scene, Perez finds [[Billy (Saw)|Billy]], Jigsaw's puppet, in the office. She is told that Strahm will \"soon take the life of an innocent man\" and that her \"next step is critical\". Ignoring past clues that she is in danger, Perez continues with the investigation before Billy explodes; she is rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Furious, Strahm interrogates Jill, who recounts Jigsaw's backstory. She was once pregnant with a boy to be named Gideon, but suffered a [[miscarriage]] when Cecil Adams robbed the clinic at which she was employed and he slammed a door into her stomach. She and her husband grew apart and divorced. After learning that he had cancer and only a short while to live, Jigsaw placed Cecil in a trap which collapsed prematurely; Cecil then lunged at Jigsaw, but fell into a mesh of barbed wire. Strahm makes connections from Jill's story to the Gideon Meat Factory, the scene of Rigg's final test.\n\nStrahm arrives but finds himself lost, accidentally trailing Jeff Denlon. Rigg, meanwhile, approaches his final test. In the next room are Art, Matthews, and Hoffman; it was revealed earlier that if the door was opened before Rigg's time was up, Matthews' head would be crushed between two ice blocks and Hoffman would be electrocuted by a complex device. Rigg charges through the door with one second to spare; despite Matthews' attempts to stop Rigg by shooting him, he is killed. Rigg shoots Art while, in another room, Strahm faces off with Jeff, who brandishes a gun, unaware that Jeff is frantically searching for his daughter. Strahm kills Jeff while Hoffman, who was never in any danger and is Jigsaw's other apprentice, rises and seals an injured Rigg and a bewildered Strahm in the factory.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as Agent [[Peter Strahm]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as [[Jill Tuck]]\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as Officer [[Daniel Rigg]]\n* [[Athena Karkanis]] as Agent [[Lindsey Perez]]\n* [[Louis Ferreira|Justin Louis]] as Art Blank\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[Jeff Denlon]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as [[Lynn Denlon]]\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Detective [[Allison Kerry]]\n* Mike Realba as Detective Fisk\n* Simon Reynolds as SWAT Member Lamanna\n* Kelly Jones as SWAT Member Pete\n* [[Marty Adams]] as Ivan Landsness\n* Sarain Boylan as Brenda\n* Billy Otis as Cecil Adams\n* James Van Patten as Dr. Adam Heffner\n* Kevin Rushton as Trevor\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Vagrant\n* Ingrid Hart as Tracy Rigg\n* [[Niamh Wilson]] as Corbett Denlon\n* [[Janet Land]] as Morgan\n* [[Ron Lea]] as Rex\n* Joanne Boland as Crime Scene Photographer\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as [[Gus Colyard]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as [[Addison Corday]]\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as Michael Marks\n* Mike Butters as [[Paul Leahy (Saw)|Paul Leahy]]\n* [[J.

An executive discovered [[Marcus Dunstan]] and [[Patrick Melton]] and read their script ''[[The Collector (2009 film)|The Midnight Man]]''. The executive thought that the duo's script could serve as a prequel to the [[Saw (2004 film)|first film]], detailing a traumatic event in [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]'s early life. However, producers [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]] didn't want to do a prequel and dropped the idea, but the script led Dunstan and Melton to be hired to write the next three ''Saw'' films.<ref name=\"How 'The Collector' Was Almost a Prequel to Saw!\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16731|title=How 'The Collector' Was Almost a Prequel to Saw!|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=May 18, 2021}}</ref> [[Thomas Fenton]] also joined Dunstan and Melton as writer to the film, though [[Marek Posival]] was attached to write as well at one point.<ref>[https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7904 Actual writer for ''Saw IV'' revealed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402181539/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7904 |date=April 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nStepping into the franchise was tricky for Dunstan and Melton given the serialized nature of the ''Saw'' films, but they counted with Bousman and the crew to watch over them, pitching a trilogy which would start with ''Saw IV'' and conclude in ''[[Saw VI]]''. The duo didn't have any trouble in bringing Jigsaw back into the story despite his death in the last film, as the character had been dying since the original film, feeling that the film wouldn't feel like a ''Saw'' entry without the character on it. Once the duo was hired and showed ''Saw III'', they begged the crew to spare [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]], who was originally depicted to be killed in the third film, but at their insistence the producers had his death scene removed from that film so they could bring him back in the fourth film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2016/10/27/marcus-dunstan-interview/|title=Marcus Dunstan talks stunts, 'Saw' and his new film 'The Neighbour'|publisher=THN|accessdate=June 29, 2021}}</ref> In earlier drafts, ''Saw IV'' was going to take place simultaneously as the original ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and it would have included a scene of Agent Peter Strahm finding and entering the bathroom, moments after Adam Stanheight was left in there to die by Jigsaw. Adam would have attempted to shoot him out of panic, prompting the agent to kill him in self-defense. This was eventually changed to the film taking place simultaneously with ''Saw III'' instead.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Like in previous entries, a lot of rewrites took place during the writing process, leading many unused ideas for the film to later be recycled for ''[[Saw V]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/31/exclusive-interview-patrick-melton|title=Exclusive Interview: Patrick Melton|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Bousman, he stated that the last work on ''Saw IV'' would happen in August to be able to have prints made.<ref name=\"MObousman\"/> At [[San Diego Comic-Con|Comic Con Intermeational]] 2007, it was revealed by Bousman and Burg that the MPAA had given the film an NC-17 rating.
