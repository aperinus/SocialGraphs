The family takes a trip to the oceanside [[Rhode Island]] home of his parents for an annual family gathering. Also in attendance are Dan's brother and sister with their families, along with Dan's younger brother Mitch, who is known for his carefree lifestyle.\n\nThe morning after their arrival, Dan meets Marie in a bookshop. They share a muffin and a heart-felt conversation, although Marie gently warns Dan that she has a boyfriend. Dan returns to his parents' house and announces that he has \"met someone\". Mitch introduces his new girlfriend, who turns out to be Marie. Dan is disheartened and resists his father's relationship advice about finding someone of his own.\n\nDan reluctantly agrees to a double date with their once unattractive childhood friend, Ruthie \"Pig Face\" Draper. Marie jealously watches Dan and Ruthie. The next morning, Dan endures her 'punishment' for his late night with Ruthie by eating the burnt pancakes which she serves him. Tension grows between Dan and Marie, culminating at the family talent show. Dan accompanies Mitch on the guitar as Mitch sings, \"[[Let My Love Open the Door]]\".  During the bridge, Dan begins to sing too, seemingly to Marie. The next morning, Marie breaks up with Mitch. However, Marie and Dan meet to talk at a bowling alley. The meeting evolves into a date and finally a passionate kiss, interrupted when Dan's entire family arrives to bowl. Mitch punches Dan in the face, and Marie hurries out. Meanwhile, Dan's middle daughter, Cara, grows more frustrated because of his meddling in her relationship with her boyfriend, Marty.\n\nDan and his daughters travel to [[New York City]], where they finally find Marie at her gym. As he makes eye contact with her, Dan, in voice-over, tells the readers of his advice column that instead of merely planning ahead in life, they should \"plan to be surprised.\"\n\nThe film ends with Dan and Marie celebrating their wedding at his parents' Rhode Island home, Mitch happily dancing with Ruthie, and Cara happily dancing with Marty, whom Dan has now accepted.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Dan Burns, widower, and father of 3 daughters\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Marie Diamond, Mitch's girlfriend and Dan's love interest later 2nd wife\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Jane Burns, eldest daughter of Dan\n* [[Britt Robertson|Brittany Robertson]] as Cara Burns, second daughter of Dan\n* Marlene Lawston as Lilly Burns, youngest daughter of Dan\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Mitch Burns, Dan's brother (as well as the youngest of all his siblings.) \n* [[John Mahoney]] as John \"Poppy\" Burns, Dan's father\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Nana Burns, Dan's mother\n* [[Norbert Leo Butz]] as Clay Burns, Dan's  brother\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Amy Burns, Dan's sister\n* [[Amy Ryan]] as Eileen Burns, Clay's wife\n* [[Frank Wood (actor)|Frank Wood]] as Howard Wilson, Amy's husband\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Dr. Ruthie \"Pigface\" Draper, Mitch's love interest\n* Felipe Dieppa as Marty, Cara's boyfriend\n* [[Bernie McInerney]] as James Lamson, newspaper proprietor\n* [[Amy Landecker]] as Cindy Lamson, newspaper editor\n* [[Matthew Morrison]] as Policeman\n* Stephen Mellor as Bookstore Clerk\n* Henry Miller as Will Burns, Clay and Eileen's oldest son\n* Ella Miller as Rachel Burns, Clay and Eileen's oldest daughter\n* [[CJ Adams|Cameron \"CJ\" Adams]] as Elliot Burns, Clay and Eileen's youngest son\n* Jessica Lussier as Jessica Burns, Clay and Eileen's youngest daughter\n* Seth D'Antuono as Gus Wilson, Amy & Howard's son\n* Margot Janson as Olivia Wilson, Amy & Howard's oldest daughter\n* Willa Cuthrell-Tuttleman as Bella Wilson, Amy & Howard's youngest daughter\n* Shana Carr as Suzanne Burns, Dan's late wife\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Lily\u2019s Dance Partner\n}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened October 26, 2007 in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and grossed $11.8 million in 1,921 theaters its opening weekend, ranking #2 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl558663169/weekend/ |title=Dan in Real Life (2007) - Weekend Box Office |access-date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> As of February 2, 2011, it has grossed $68,377,859.
