The film had its US premiere on October 10, 2014, at the [[New York Film Festival]] and its UK premiere on October 17, 2014, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]]. The film features Snowden and [[Glenn Greenwald]], and was co-produced by Poitras, [[Mathilde Bonnefoy]], and [[Dirk Wilutzky]], with [[Steven Soderbergh]] and others serving as [[executive producer]]s. ''Citizenfour'' received critical acclaim upon release, and was the recipient of numerous accolades, including [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]]. This film is the third part to a 9/11 trilogy following ''[[My Country, My Country]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Oath (2010 film)|The Oath]]'' (2010).\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:CITIZENFOUR (2014) trailer.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:05|Shot from the film trailer for ''Citizenfour'']]\nIn January 2013, Laura Poitras, an American documentary film director/producer who had been working for several years on a film about monitoring programs in the United States that were the result of the [[September 11 attacks]], receives an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who calls himself \"Citizen Four.\"<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/snowdens-first-emails-to-poitras/|title=These Are the Emails Snowden Sent to First Introduce His Epic NSA Leaks|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 13, 2014}}</ref> (Per a 2014 ''Vice'' article featuring Poitras, Snowden chose this codename as a nod to three NSA whistleblowers who came before him: [[William Binney (intelligence official)|Bill Binney]], J. Kirk Wiebe, and [[Thomas A. Drake|Thomas Drake]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Woman Who Captured Snowden |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezv587/laura-poitras-the-woman-who-captured-snowden |access-date=2022-11-13 |website=www.vice.com |language=en}}</ref>) In Snowden's initial message to Poitras, he offers her inside information about illegal [[wiretapping]] practices of the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, accompanied by columnist Glenn Greenwald and ''[[The Guardian]]'' intelligence reporter [[Ewen MacAskill]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview|title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light|author1=Suzanna Andrews|author2=Bryan Burrough|author3=Sarah Ellison|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 2014}}</ref> she travels to [[Hong Kong]] with her camera for the first meeting with \"Citizenfour\" in a hotel, who reveals himself as [[Edward Snowden]]. Scenes of their meeting take place in Snowden's hotel room, where he maintains his privacy. Shots of Snowden in his bed, in front of his mirror and of the hotel from a distance form the character of Snowden as a trapped political agent.<ref>Thomas Keenan, \u201cWindows: of Vulnerability,\u201d Ed. Bruce Robbins, The Phantom Public Sphere (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,1997), 121-141</ref>\n\nAfter four days of interviews, on June 9, Snowden's identity is made public at his request. As media outlets begin to discover his location at the [[The Mira Hong Kong|Mira Hotel]], Snowden moves into Poitras' room in an attempt to elude phone calls made to his room. Facing potential [[extradition]] and prosecution in the United States, Snowden schedules a meeting with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and applies for refugee status. After Poitras believes she is being followed, she leaves Hong Kong for [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].\n\nOn June 21, the US government requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. Snowden manages to depart from Hong Kong, but his US passport is cancelled before he can connect to [[Havana]], stranding him in the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in [[Moscow]] for 40 days. On August 1, 2013, the Russian government grants Snowden temporary [[right of asylum|asylum]] for a period of one year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chumley|first1=Cheryl|last2=Sherfinski|first2=David|title=Edward Snowden granted asylum in Russia, leaves airport|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/1/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-granted-asylum-ru/|work=The Washington Times|access-date=April 21, 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, Greenwald returns to his home in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and speaks publicly about United States' utilization of NSA programs for foreign surveillance. Greenwald and Poitras maintain a correspondence wherein they both express reluctance to return to the United States.\n\nThroughout, the film offers smaller vignettes that precede and follow Snowden's Hong Kong interviews, including [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] speaking about NSA programs, and eventually testifying before the [[Bundestag|German Parliament]] regarding [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA spying in Germany.]]\n\nThe film closes with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting once again, this time in Russia. Greenwald and Snowden discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful to only write down and not speak critical pieces of information. Greenwald tears these documents creating a pile of scraps, before slowly removing them from the table.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Snowden]]\n* [[Glenn Greenwald]]\n* [[Laura Poitras]]\n* [[Ewen MacAskill]]\n* [[Jacob Appelbaum]]\n* [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]]\n* [[Julian Assange]]\n* [[Ladar Levison]]\n* [[Jeremy Scahill]]\n* [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]]\n\n== Background on Snowden ==\n[[File:Edward Snowden 2013-10-9 (1) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Edward Snowden, October 2013.]]\nBorn on June 21, 1983 in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]], Edward Snowden first became involved with the United States government upon his enrollment in the [[Army Reserves]] in the spring of 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/edward-snowden-21262897|title=Edward Snowden|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref> Snowden claims to have left the program after a few months because he broke his legs in a training accident while a US House of Representatives report claims he had [[shin splints]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Executive Summary of Review of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|year=2016|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> He then began working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 2006 and was stationed with diplomatic cover at the embassy in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]] in 2007.
