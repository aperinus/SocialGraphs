Directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] and written by [[Dustin Lance Black]], the film stars [[Sean Penn]] as Milk and [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Dan White]], a city supervisor, and [[Victor Garber]] as San Francisco Mayor [[George Moscone]].\n\nAttempts to put Milk's life to film followed a 1984 documentary of his life and the aftermath of [[Moscone\u2013Milk assassinations|his assassination]], titled ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]'', which was loosely based upon [[Randy Shilts]]'s 1982 biography, ''[[The Mayor of Castro Street]]'' (the film won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] for 1984, and was awarded Special Jury Prize at the first [[Sundance Film Festival]], among other awards). Various scripts were considered in the early 1990s, but projects fell through for different reasons, until 2007. Much of ''Milk'' was filmed on [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro Street]] and other locations in [[San Francisco]], including Milk's former storefront, [[Castro Camera]].\n\nThe film was released to critical acclaim and grossed $54 million worldwide. It earned numerous accolades from film critics and guilds for Penn and Brolin's performance, Van Sant's directing, and Black's screenplay, it received 8 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and went on to win two: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Penn, his second Oscar, and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Black.<!-- Place a quote here that represents how reviewers saw the impact of the film -->\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with archival footage of police raiding [[gay bar]]s and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s November 27, 1978 announcement to the press that [[Harvey Milk]] and Mayor [[George Moscone]] [[Moscone\u2013Milk assassinations|had been assassinated]]. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, [[Scott Smith (activist)|Scott Smith]].\n\nDissatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of [[Eureka Valley, San Francisco, California|Eureka Valley]], a [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly [[gay village|gay neighborhood]] known as [[The Castro, San Francisco|The Castro]]. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a [[Gay activism|gay activist]], eventually becoming a mentor for [[Cleve Jones]]. Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but he grows frustrated with Milk's devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay \"establishment\" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse.\n\nAfter two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the [[California State Assembly]], Milk finally wins a seat on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and the third openly homosexual politician in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor [[Dan White]], a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes.\n\nMilk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a [[psychiatric hospital]] from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], an [[initiative]] on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]], a conservative state senator from [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by [[Anita Bryant]] and her organization ''[[Save Our Children]]'' in [[Dade County, Florida]] to repeal a local gay rights ordinance.\n\nOn November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. A desperate White favors a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition, resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk.\n\nOn the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]] through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution-style. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a [[closeted]] gay man.<ref>Edelstein D. \"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97518380 'Milk' Is Much More Than A Martyr Movie].\" ''[[National Public Radio|NPR]]''. November 26, 2008. Accessed on: January 3, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe last scene is a [[candlelight vigil]] held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city.

crew also talked to people who knew Milk to shape their approach to the era.\n\nThe filmmakers also revisited the location of Milk's camera shop on Castro Street and dressed the street to match the film's 1970s setting. The camera shop, which had become a gift shop, was bought out by the filmmakers for a couple of months to use in production. Production on Castro Street also revitalized the [[Castro Theatre]], whose facade was repainted and whose neon marquee was redone. Filming also took place at the [[San Francisco City Hall]], while White's office, where Milk was assassinated, was recreated elsewhere due to the city hall's offices having become more modern.

So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it needs to be in order to hold us and take our breath away.
