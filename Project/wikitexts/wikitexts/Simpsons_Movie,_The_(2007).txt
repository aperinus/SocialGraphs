The film was directed by the show's supervising director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and stars the show's regular cast of [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Pamela Hayden]], [[Karl Wiedergott]], [[Marcia Wallace]], [[Maggie Roswell]], [[Russi Taylor]], and [[Joe Mantegna]] reprising their roles and [[Albert Brooks]] as the film's main [[antagonist]], Russ Cargill, head of the EPA. The film follows [[Homer Simpson]], who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], causing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to imprison the town under a giant glass dome. After he and [[Simpson family|his family]] escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town's demolition by Cargill. Homer works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself in an effort to save it.\n\nAlthough previous attempts to create a ''Simpsons'' film had been made, they failed due to the lack of lengthy script. Eventually in 2001, producers [[James L. Brooks]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Scully]] and [[Richard Sakai]] began development on the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]], [[George Meyer]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Matt Selman]], [[John Swartzwelder]] and [[Jon Vitti]] were assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one adapted. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, also continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]] from [[Erin Brockovich]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Kelsey Grammer]], who would have reprised his role as [[Sideshow Bob]]. [[Tom Hanks]] and the members of [[Green Day]] voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of its main antagonist, Russ Cargill.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including [[Burger King]] and [[7-Eleven]], the latter of which [[Kwik-E-Mart#7-Eleven promotion|transformed selected stores]] into [[Kwik-E-Mart]]s. The film premiered in [[Springfield, Vermont]] on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later on July 27 by [[20th Century Fox]] across the United States. ''The Simpsons Movie'' received positive reviews and grossed $536.4 million worldwide, becoming the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2007]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|second-highest-grossing traditionally animated film]] (behind [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[The Lion King]]''), and the highest-grossing film based on an animated television series.  The film received praise for its humor, emotional weight, and callbacks to early seasons. The film was nominated for numerous awards, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter finishing a concert at Lake [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], [[Green Day]] tries to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment. However, the people refuse to listen and the pollution in the lake erodes the band's [[barge]], causing them to drown. During their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson]] has a spiritual experience and frantically prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield, but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes it seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and her new friend, Colin, hold a seminar and convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and Bart go to [[Krusty Burger]], where Homer adopts a pig to save it from being killed by [[Krusty the Clown]]. Marge, identifying the pig as a part of Grampa's prophecy, warns Homer to get rid of it, but he refuses. Homer's fawning over the pig makes Bart, now fed up with his father's carelessness, look to their neighbor, [[Ned Flanders]], as a father figure.\n\nHomer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, disgusting Marge. Homer attempts to dispose of it safely at Marge's request but then learns of a place that is giving away donuts for free. In a rush to get to the giveaway, Homer dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a [[squirrel]] stumbles into it and becomes severely mutated. While bonding on a hike, Bart and Flanders notice the squirrel, which the EPA capture. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, informs [[President of the United States|president]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on Springfield's pollution crisis. As a response, the president orders to imprison Springfield under a giant glass dome. When Homer's silo is discovered on live television, all of the townspeople (except for the Flanders' and Colin) form an angry mob and attempt to [[lynching|lynch]] them. The family escapes through a [[sinkhole]], which destroys the house soon after. The family flees to [[Alaska]], where they try to restart their lives.\n\nWithin 93 days, Springfield completely exhausts its daily supplies and the townspeople lose their sanity while trying to escape from the dome. Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to spread around the world, plots to destroy Springfield by tricking the president into ordering its demolition. The Simpsons see a television advertisement, featuring [[Tom Hanks]], for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, all of them decide to save it except for Homer, who refuses to help the people who tried to kill them. The family soon abandons Homer for his selfishness, with Marge leaving behind a message about it recorded over their wedding video, causing him to run off in search of them. The family is captured by the EPA and placed back inside the dome. After an encounter with a mysterious [[Inuit shaman]] who saves him from a [[polar bear]], Homer has an epiphany about saving the town to save himself.\n\nHomer returns home and learns about his family's capture as a helicopter lowers a [[time bomb]] suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome. Homer enters the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown. Taking a motorcycle, he rides to the church and reunites with Bart. After reconciling, Bart and Homer use the motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome. Bart throws the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Later, a shotgun-wielding Cargill confronts the pair and attempts to kill them for foiling his plan. But before he can do so, [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] knocks him out by dropping a large rock on his head. As Cargill is fired from his job and sent to prison for his actions, the townspeople decide to forgive Homer and hail him a hero for saving Springfield from destruction. He rides into the sunset with Marge, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the townspeople also help the Simpsons rebuild their house that was destroyed by the sinkhole earlier.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Simpsons characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Voice actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Credited roles\n! scope=\"col\" class=unsortable | Uncredited roles (in order of appearance)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Dan|Castellaneta}}\n|[[Homer Simpson]], [[Grampa Simpson|Abe Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]], [[Sideshow Mel]], [[Mr. Teeny]],  [[EPA]] Official, [[Itchy and Scratchy|Itchy]], and [[Barney Gumble]]\n|Stage Manager, [[Blue Haired Lawyer]], Multi-Eyed Squirrel, [[Hans Moleman]], Panicky Man, Kissing Cop, Bear, Boy on Phone, [[NSA]] Worker, Officer, [[Rich Texan]], [[Santa's Little Helper]], and [[Squeaky-Voiced Teen]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Julie|Kavner}}\n|[[Marge Simpson]], and [[Patty and Selma|Selma Bouvier, and Patty Bouvier]]\n|{{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Nancy|Cartwright}}\n|[[Bart Simpson]], [[Ralph Wiggum]], [[Todd Flanders]], and [[Nelson Muntz]]\n|[[Maggie Simpson]], TV Daughter, Woman on Phone, and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney Zzyzwicz]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Yeardley|Smith}}\n|[[Lisa Simpson]]\n|{{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Hank|Azaria}}\n|[[Moe Szyslak]], [[Chief Wiggum]], [[Cletus Spuckler]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[List of The Simpsons recurring characters#Lou|Lou]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Captain McCallister]], [[Bumblebee Man]], and [[List of The Simpsons recurring characters#Dr. Nick Rivera|Dr. Nick]]\n|[[Carl Carlson|Carl]], Male EPA Worker, Dome Depot Announcer, Kissing Cop, Carnival Barker, Gas Station Clerk, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]], EPA Passenger, Robot, and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy|Wiseguy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Harry|Shearer}}\n|[[Mr. Burns]], [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]], [[Ned Flanders]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]], [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], President [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], [[Kent Brockman]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], and [[Otto Mann]]\n|[[Itchy and Scratchy|Scratchy]], Skull, Toll Booth Operator, and Guard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Pamela|Hayden}}\n|[[Milhouse Van Houten]], [[Rod Flanders]], and [[Jimbo Jones]]\n|{{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Tress|MacNeille}}\n|Medicine Woman, [[Agnes Skinner]], [[Crazy Cat Lady]], Colin, and [[Cookie Kwan]]\n|Sweet Old Lady, [[Mrs. Muntz]], [[Plopper]], Female EPA Worker, [[List of The Simpsons characters#Lindsey Neagle|Lindsey Neagle]], [[GPS]] Voice, TV Son, Girl on Phone, and [[List of The Simpsons characters#Dolph Starbeam|Dolph Starbeam]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{sortname|Albert|Brooks}} (as \"A.
