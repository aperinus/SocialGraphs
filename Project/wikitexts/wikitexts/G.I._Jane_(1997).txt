Jane''''' is a 1997 American [[war drama film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Demi Moore]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], and [[Anne Bancroft]]. The film tells the fictional story of the first woman to undergo [[special operations]] training similar to the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Largo Entertainment]], [[Scott Free Productions]], and [[Caravan Pictures]], and distributed by [[Hollywood Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews, with Moore's performance receiving criticism and winning her the [[Razzie Award for Worst Actress]]. It also was a box office bomb, grossing $48&nbsp;million on a $50&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400\u2013700 words. -->\nA [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] interviews a candidate for the position of [[Secretary of the Navy]]. Senator Lillian DeHaven from [[Texas]] criticizes the Navy for not being [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]]. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: If women compare favorably with men in a series of test cases, the military will integrate women fully into all occupations of the Navy.\n\nThe first test is the training course of the U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to the SEALs [[United States Navy SEAL selection and training|UDT/BUDs]]<ref>[https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/gi-jane-errors/ 39 horrible technical errors in \u2018GI Jane\u2019] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027021408/https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/gi-jane-errors/ |date=2021-10-27 }}, \"4:31 The [[admiral]] makes the first mention of \u201cC.R.T \u2014 Combined Reconnaissance Team,\u201d which he refers to as SEALs. There\u2019s no such thing as CRT. The training program that Navy SEALs go through is called BUD/S, or Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL.\"</ref>) Senator DeHaven selects [[topographical]] analyst [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Jordan O'Neil, because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates.\n\nTo make the grade, O'Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost sixty percent of candidates wash out, most before the fourth week, with the third week being particularly intensive (\"[[United States Navy SEAL selection and training#Phase 1: Physical conditioning (7 weeks)|hell week]]\"). The enigmatic [[Command Master Chief Petty Officer|Command Master Chief]] John James Urgayle runs the training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits' physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship [[Fender (boating)|fender]]s up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts.\n\nGiven a 30-second \"[[gender-norming]]\" allowance in an [[obstacle course]], O'Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. The master chief observes O'Neil helping the other candidates by allowing them to climb on her back to make it over the wall obstacle course. Eight weeks into the program, during [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] training in [[Captiva, Florida]], the Master Chief ties her to a chair with her hands behind her back, grabs hold of her and slams her through the door, then picking her up off the floor he repeatedly dunks her head in ice-cold water in front of the other crew members. O'Neil retaliates and is successful in causing him some injury, despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees.\n\nNavy leaders, confident that a woman would quickly drop out, become concerned. The media learn of O'Neil's involvement, and she becomes a sensation known as \"G.I. Jane.\" and \"[[Joan of Arc]]\". Soon, she must contend with trumped-up charges that she is a [[lesbian]], and is fraternizing with women. O'Neil is told that she will be given a desk job during the investigation and, if cleared, will need to repeat her training from the beginning. She decides to \"ring out\" (ringing a bell three times, signaling her voluntary withdrawal from the program) rather than accept a desk job.\n\nIt is later revealed that the photo evidence of O'Neil's alleged fraternization came from Senator DeHaven's office. DeHaven never intended for O'Neil to succeed; she used O'Neil as a bargaining chip to prevent military base closings in her home state of Texas. O'Neil threatens to expose DeHaven, who then has the charges voided and O'Neil restored to the program.\n\nThe final phase of training, an operational readiness exercise, is interrupted by an emergency that requires the CRT trainees' support. The situation involves a [[reconnaissance satellite]] powered by [[weapons-grade plutonium]] that fell into the Libyan desert. A team of [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Rangers]] is dispatched to retrieve the plutonium, but their evacuation plan fails, and the trainees are sent to assist the Rangers. The Master Chief's shooting of a Libyan soldier to protect O'Neil leads to a confrontation with a Libyan patrol. During the mission, O'Neil, using her experience as a topographical analyst, realizes when she sees the team's map that the Master Chief is not going to use the route the others believe he will in regrouping with the others. She also displays a definitive ability in leadership and strategy while rescuing the injured Master Chief, whom she and McCool pull out of an explosives-laden \"[[kill zone]].\" With [[helicopter gunship]]s delivering the final assault to the defenders, the rescue mission is a success.\n\nUpon their return, all those who participated in the mission are accepted to the CRT. Urgayle gives O'Neil his [[Navy Cross]] and a book of poetry containing a short poem, \"Self-pity\", by [[D. H. Lawrence]], as acknowledgment of her accomplishment and in gratitude for rescuing him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Demi Moore]] as [[Lieutenant]] Jordan O'Neil\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Command Master Chief]] John James 'Jack' Urgayle\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Senator Lillian DeHaven (TX.)\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Royce Harper\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Salem\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Chief of Staff\n* [[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]] as Instructor Max Pyro\n* [[David Warshofsky]] as Instructor Johns\n* [[David Vadim]] as [[Sergeant First Class]] Cortez\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Lieutenant Blondell\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Lieutenant McCool\n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] F.
