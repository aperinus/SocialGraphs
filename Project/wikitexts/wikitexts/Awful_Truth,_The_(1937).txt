Based on the 1923 play ''The Awful Truth'' by Arthur Richman, the film recounts how a distrustful rich couple begins divorce proceedings, only to interfere with one another's romances. This was McCarey's first film for [[Columbia Pictures]] with the dialogue and comic elements being largely improvised by the director and actors. It was Dunne's second comedy following ''[[Theodora Goes Wild]]'' (1936), for which she was also nominated for a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]]. Her costumes were designed by [[Robert Kalloch]]. Although Grant tried to leave the production due to McCarey's directorial style, ''The Awful Truth'' saw his emergence as an A-list star and proponent of on-the-set improvisation.\n\nThe film was a box office hit. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], Best Actress, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. McCarey won for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. ''The Awful Truth'' was selected in 1996 for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n''The Awful Truth'' was the first of three film pairings co-starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, followed by ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940) and ''[[Penny Serenade]]'' (1941).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,tv_miniseries,documentary,video_game,short&roles=nm0000026,nm0002050&sort=year,asc|title = Feature Film/TV Episode/Video/TV Movie/TV Special/TV Mini-Series/Documentary/Video Game/Short Film, with Cary Grant, Irene Dunne (Sorted by Year Ascending)| website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Warriner ([[Cary Grant]]) tells his wife he is going on vacation to [[Florida]], but instead spends the week at his sports club in New York City. He returns home to find that his wife, Lucy ([[Irene Dunne]]), spent the night in the company of her handsome music teacher, Armand Duvalle ([[Alexander D'Arcy]]). Lucy claims his car broke down unexpectedly. Lucy discovers that Jerry did not actually go to Florida. Their mutual suspicion results in divorce proceedings, with Lucy winning custody of their dog. The judge orders the divorce finalized in 90 days.\n\nLucy moves into an apartment with her Aunt Patsy ([[Cecil Cunningham]]). Her neighbor is amiable but rustic [[Oklahoma]] oilman Dan Leeson ([[Ralph Bellamy]]), whose mother ([[Esther Dale]]) does not approve of Lucy. Jerry subtly ridicules Dan in front of Lucy, which causes Lucy to tie herself more closely to Dan. Jerry begins dating sweet-natured but simple singer Dixie Belle Lee ([[Joyce Compton]]), unaware that she performs an embarrassing, [[Sexual suggestiveness|sexually suggestive]] act at a local nightclub.\n\nConvinced that Lucy is still having an affair with Duvalle, Jerry bursts into Duvalle's apartment only to discover that Lucy is a legitimate vocal student of Duvalle and is giving her first [[Concert#Recital|recital]]. Realizing he may still love Lucy, Jerry undermines Lucy's character with Mrs. Leeson even as Dan and Lucy agree to marry. When Jerry attempts to reconcile with Lucy afterward, he discovers Duvalle hiding in Lucy's apartment and they have a fistfight while Dan and his mother apologize for assuming the worst about Lucy. When Jerry chases Armand out the door, Dan breaks off his [[engagement]] to Lucy and he and his mother return to Oklahoma.\n\nSome weeks pass, and Jerry begins dating high-profile heiress Barbara Vance ([[Molly Lamont]]). Realizing she still loves Jerry, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion the night the divorce decree is to become final. Pretending to be Jerry's sister, she undermines Jerry's character, implying that \"their\" father was [[Working class in the United States|working class]] rather than wealthy. Acting like a [[slut|slatternly]] showgirl, she recreates Dixie's risqu\u00e9 musical number from earlier in the film. The snobbish Vances are appalled.\n\nJerry attempts to explain away Lucy's behavior as [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]], and says he will drive Lucy home. Lucy repeatedly sabotages the car on the ride to delay their parting. Pulled over by motorcycle police officers, who believe Jerry is drunk, Lucy manages to wreck the car. The police give the couple a lift to Aunt Patsy's nearby cabin. Although sleeping in different (but adjoining) bedrooms, Jerry and Lucy slowly overcome their pride and a series of comic mishaps in order to admit \"the awful truth\" that they still love one another. They reconcile at midnight, just before their divorce is to be finalized.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes:{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=264}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Lucy Warriner\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Jerry Warriner\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Dan Leeson\n* [[Alexander D'Arcy]] as Armand Duvalle\n* [[Cecil Cunningham]] as Aunt Patsy\n* [[Molly Lamont]] as Barbara Vance\n* [[Esther Dale]] as Mrs. Leeson\n* [[Joyce Compton]] as Dixie Belle Lee\n* [[Bob Allen (actor)|Robert Allen]] as Frank Randall\n* [[Zita Moulton]] as Lady Fabian\n* [[Robert Warwick]] as Mr. Vance\n* [[Mary Forbes]] as Mrs. Vance\n* [[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]] as Mr. Smith, the dog\n}}\n\n==Pre-production==\n[[File:Promo for The Awful Truth.jpg|thumb|right|Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in ''The Awful Truth'']]\nThe film is based on a 1923 stage play ''The Awful Truth'' by playwright Arthur Richman.{{sfn|Leonard|1981|pages=116-117}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Sloan|first=J.

Jerry is violence-prone (he punches Lucy in the eye), and the couple fight over a necklace (not a dog). Much of the action in Taylor's script is set at Jerry's club. The mishaps in the script cause Jerry to crack up emotionally.

Cohn declined to say anything about the film, and allowed Bellamy to talk to Leo McCarey.{{sfn|Maltin|2018|page=171}} Bellamy went to McCarey's home to discuss the issue with him. McCarey was charming and witty, but evaded all of Bellamy's questions and concerns.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}}\n\n===Initial disruptiveness of McCarey's working style===\nThe first four or five days on the set{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}} were deeply upsetting to Dunne, Grant, and Bellamy due to the lack of a script and McCarey's working methods.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=84}} McCarey had the cast sit around on the set the first few days and largely swap stories.{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=34}} The lack of rehearsal activity and script{{Efn|One source says Dunne had seen fragments of a script.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|page=125}}}} caused Dunne such emotional distress that she spontaneously burst into tears several times each day.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} Grant was so nervous that at times he became physically ill.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=88}} When McCarey bowed to the cast's concerns and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] a scene for Dunne and Grant, Grant refused to perform it.{{sfn|McCann|1998|pages=84-85}}\n[[File:The Awful Truth 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Bellamy, Cary Grant, and Irene Dunne in ''The Awful Truth'']]\nCary Grant in particular was unnerved by McCarey's behavior and lack of a script. Grant had spent most of his career at [[Paramount Studios]], which had a factory-like approach to motion picture production;{{sfn|Kendall|2002|pages=197-198}} actors were expected to learn their lines and be ready every morning, and shooting schedules were strictly enforced.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} McCarey's [[Improvisation#Performing arts|improvisational]] style was deeply unsettling to Grant,{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} and at the end of the first week Grant sent Cohn an eight-page memorandum titled \"What's Wrong With This Picture\".{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} Grant asked Cohn to let him out of the film,{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}}{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Eagan|2010|pages=265-266}} offering to do one or more pictures for free{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=34}}{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} and even saying he'd reimburse Cohn $5,000 if he were released.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}}{{Efn|Grant allegedly asked his friend, actor [[Joel McCrea]], to take over the part.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=269}}}} McCarey was so angry at Grant that he stopped speaking to him and told Cohn he'd kick in another $5,000 to get Grant off the film.{{sfn|Wansell|1983|page=121}} Cohn ignored both the memo and the offers.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}}{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} Grant also sought to switch roles with Bellamy{{sfn|Eagan|2010|pages=265-266}}{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} and asked Cohn to pressure McCarey into sticking to a more conventional style of filmmaking.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} Again, Cohn said no to Grant's requests.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}}{{sfn|Eagan|2010|pages=265-266}} McCarey later said that Grant \"had no sound judgment\" when it came to determining what made for good comedy,{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} and McCarey seemed to harbor a grudge against Grant for decades for trying to get out of the picture.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=269}}\n\n===Cast support for improvisation===\nAccording to Bellamy, after the first five days, the three leads began to believe McCarey was a comedy genius.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}}{{sfn|McCann|1998|pages=84-85}}\n\nMcCarey believed that [[Improvisation#Comedy|improvisation]] was the key to great comedy.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} \"[A] lot of times we'd go into a scene [on ''The Awful Truth''] with nothing at all\", he said.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} His working method was to ask his cast to improvise the scene,{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} creating their own dialogue and blocking their own action before allowing cameras to roll. If a problem arose with a scene, McCarey would sit at a piano on the set and pick out tunes and sing until a solution came to him.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} McCarey supported his actors' comedy and other choices, which quickly alleviated the tension which had built up on the set.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} For example, Ralph Bellamy was told to bring a selection of clothing from his own extensive, personal wardrobe.{{sfn|Maltin|2018|pages=171-172}} He did so, but was worried that he had not been given costuming. McCarey told him that the clothes he'd brought from home fit the part perfectly, which made Bellamy feel comfortable in his acting and comedy choices.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} McCarey was also extremely patient with his cast, understanding of their concerns, and sympathetic to their needs and problems. He also used his own wit to keep his cast in good humor.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}} Irene Dunne later recalled that the entire cast loved working on the picture because every day was full of laughter. Many actors didn't want each day's work to end, because they were having such a good time.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}}\n[[File:Dunne-Grant-Asta-The-Awful-Truth.jpg|thumb|right|Dunne and Grant with \"Asta\" the dog]]\nCary Grant began trusting the director{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} once he realized that McCarey recognized Grant's strengths{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} and welcomed Grant's ideas about blocking, dialogue, and comic bits.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=97}} McCarey also had the ability to get his performers to mimic his own unique mannerisms. (It was something Irene Dunne thoroughly admired.){{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=85}} McCarey taught Grant a repertoire of comic vocalizations (like grunts) and movements and asked him to work with them. In turn, Grant imitated much of McCarey's own mannerisms and personality,{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} becoming a \"clone\" of McCarey.{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=34}} Grant biographer Graham McCann says it would be an \"overstatement\" to say that McCarey gave Grant an on-screen personality.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=97}} Grant had been working on this acting persona for some time;{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=97}}{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=85}} McCarey merely made Grant think more precisely about what he was trying to accomplish on camera.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=97}}{{Efn|McCarey appeared to hold a grudge against Grant for the rest of his life. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] believes McCarey felt \"Grant never gave him enough credit for basically handing him the characteristics he would play variations on throughout the rest of his career\". Grant never seemed upset by McCarey's ill-will, apparently understanding why McCarey felt the way he did.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}}}} Additionally, McCarey worked to give Grant comic dialogue and [[physical comedy]] (like pratfalls) as well as sophisticated dialogue and urbane moments, efforts which Grant also deeply appreciated.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} Over time, Grant came to feel liberated rather than inhibited by the lack of a script, and seized the chance to make sure that the film's humor reflected his own. According to Ralph Bellamy, Grant enjoyed knowing that the audience was laughing at him, and worked to encourage it.{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=85}} Grant also used his early feelings of frustration to build his character's emotional and sexual frustration in the film.{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=266}}{{Efn|Irene Dunne says she helped \"calm down\" Grant's deep unease over the lack of a script.{{sfn|Gehring|2002|page=100}}}}\n\nMost of ''The Awful Truth'' was improvised on the set.{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=170}} McCarey had two guides for directing the film. The first was that he believed the film was the \"story of my life\",{{sfn|Bogdanovich|2005|page=101}} because McCarey based many scenes and comic moments on misunderstandings he had had with his own wife (although they never accused one another of infidelity).{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=85}} The second guide was McCarey's own lengthy experience directing comedy. Jerry Warriner's need to find a lie to cover for his \"boys' night out away from the wives\" is a typical scenario McCarey used in many feature motion pictures and [[short film]]s. It was also common in many of the [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts which McCarey directed for only the man's alibi to break down. Subsequently, in ''The Awful Truth'', it is Jerry's alibi that crumbles.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=85}} The [[bowler hat]] sequence in Lucy's apartment was based on a standard bit McCarey had frequently used in Laurel and Hardy films (as well as in the [[Marx Brothers]]' comedy ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), which McCarey had also directed).{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=266}} Dunne's increasingly outrageous mishaps with the car radio in the scene after Jerry and Lucy leave the Vance mansion is similar to [[Harpo Marx]]'s misadventures with a radio in ''Duck Soup''{{sfn|Gehring|2007|pages=59-60}} and incorporates the straight man (Grant for Oliver Hardy) from Laurel and Hardy bits.{{sfn|Gehring|2002|pages=54-55}}\n\nMcCarey also relied on his ability to craft a narrative from a series of unrelated sketches,{{sfn|Gehring|2006|pages=85-86}}{{Efn|McCarey called this narrative the \"ineluctability of incidents\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daney|first1=Serge|last2=Noames|first2=Jean-Louis|title=Taking Chances|journal=Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in English|date=January 1967|page=53}}</ref>}} and he often staged portions of his films like musicals, inserting a song to tie elements together.{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=266}}\n\n===Improvising the film===\nIrene Dunne had never met Cary Grant before, but she later recalled that they \"just worked from the first moment\" and called Grant a very generous actor.{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=170}} Cary Grant, in turn, said \"we just clicked\". Dunne so trusted his comedy judgment that she would often turn to him after a take and ask in a whisper, \"Funny?\"{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=123}}\n\nNearly every day during principal photography, Leo McCarey would arrive in the morning with ideas for the film written down on scraps of paper.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}}{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=86}}{{Efn|According to Cohn biographer Bob Thomas, McCarey often wrote down dialogue and directions for the day while riding in a [[taxi]] from his home to the studio.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|page=124}}}} On days when he had nothing in mind, McCarey would arrive on the set and play the piano until inspiration struck. He would then have the [[script supervisor|script girl]] write down his ideas or dialogue, and give the actors their instructions.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=269}}{{Efn|Dunne told an interviewer that all the film's dialogue was written by McCarey on the set, while the crew and actors waited.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=682}}}} Although he asked the cast to rehearse scenes, McCarey also encouraged his actors to improvise and build up the scene on their own. At times, McCarey himself acted out bits with the performers.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}}{{Efn|According to sound supervisor [[Edward Bernds]], improvisation almost always occurred during rehearsal. Lines might be improvised while photography occurred, but blocking never was. The [[Boom operator (media)|microphone operator]] had to know where the boom went in order to capture the sound.{{sfn|Bernds|1999|page=290}}}} McCarey continued to meet with screenwriter Vi\u00f1a Delmar every evening,{{sfn|Bernds|1999|page=290}} sitting with her in a parked car on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and improvising scenes for her to write down.{{sfn|Greene|2008|page=266}}{{sfn|Wansell|1983|page=121}} McCarey also relied for dialogue on writer [[Sidney Buchman]], who had joined Columbia in 1934 and who had written ''Theodora Goes Wild'' for Irene Dunne.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|page=101}} Some of the best lines and comic moments in the film remained improvised, however.{{sfn|Kendall|2002|page=197}} For example, McCarey himself came up with the idea of arguing over a dog rather than property.{{sfn|Kendall|2002|page=200}} Another example occurs when Cary Grant appears at Lucy's apartment while she is meeting for the first time with Dan Leeson. The writers did not have a line of dialogue for Grant, who [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] the line, \"The judge says this is my day to see the dog.\"{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=88}}{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=88}}{{sfn|Wansell|1983|page=122}} Grant and Dunne also came up with the idea for Jerry to tickle Lucy with a pencil while Dan Leeson is at Lucy's door.{{sfn|Kendall|2002|page=203}} Grant quickly became an accomplished improvisational actor during the shoot. He ad-libbed with such speed and composure that his co-stars often \"[[Corpsing|broke character]]\".{{sfn|McCann|1998|page=88}}\n\nThe nightclub scene was apparently also somewhat improvised on the set. In the Delmar script, Jerry's date is named Toots Biswanger and the scene is meant to parody the novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (two years before the film). She has a [[Southern American English]] accent, and Toots believes her song is a tribute to the novel. Jerry has a line in which he slyly criticizes Lucy's date by telling Dan \"It's a book.\" As Toots sings the song's critical line (\"my dreams are gone with the wind\"), the wind machine on the stage was to have blown off her hat, then her muff, then her cape.{{sfn|Kendall|2002|page=203}} On the set, the singer's name is changed to Dixie Belle, much of the dialogue is improvised, and the wind machine joke changed to a more restrained blowing of the dress.{{sfn|Kendall|2002|pages=203-204}}\n\nAccording to Dunne, the action and dialogue for the scene in the Vance mansion was all written on the set.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=682}} Dunne choreographed the dance and at least one line of dialogue,{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=9}} while the bit with the long handkerchief was a classic comic routine from silent films.{{sfn|Harvey|1998|page=683}}\n\nColumbia Pictures head Harry Cohn was not happy with McCarey's directorial methods, either. On the first day of shooting,{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=34}}{{sfn|Thomas|1990|page=124}} he walked onto the soundstage to see Bellamy singing ''Home on the Range'' off-key while Dunne tried to pick out the tune on a piano. He shook his head in disbelief and left.{{sfn|Bawden|Miller|2017|page=170}} Later, Cohn became angry when he learned McCarey was apparently dawdling on the set by playing the piano and telling stories. He angrily confronted McCarey in front of the cast and crew, shouting, \"I hired you to make a great comedy so I could show up [[Frank Capra]]. The only one who's going to laugh at this picture is Capra!\"{{sfn|Wiley|Bona|MacColl|1986|pages=77-78}} When Cohn caught McCarey playing the piano another time, McCarey dismissed his concerns by claiming to be writing a song for the film.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|page=124}} Cohn also came on the set the day [[Harold Lloyd]] was visiting. Cohn was so incensed that McCarey seemed to be telling jokes that he ordered the set cleared. Lloyd departed, and so did McCarey. Cohn finally reached McCarey at home, and in a profanity-laced conversation demanded that McCarey return to work. McCarey demanded in turn that Cohn apologize personally to everyone on the set, and send his apology to Lloyd. Cohn, unwilling to abandon the picture, perfunctorily apologized.{{sfn|Thomas|1990|page=125}} Nevertheless, Cohn did not rein in the director.{{sfn|Morgan|Davies|2016|page=149}} Cohn decided instead to write the entire picture off as a loss, since he was obligated to pay Dunne's salary whether the film was made or not and he could not fire McCarey since only McCarey knew where the film was headed.{{sfn|Greene|2008|page=266}}\n\nImprovisation proved to be a problem for actor Alexander D'Arcy, who played the suave musician Armand Duvalle. Initially, D'Arcy portrayed Duvalle as [[French people|French]]. Columbia Pictures' in-house censors vetoed his performance, saying it would offend overseas audiences. D'Arcy tried an [[Austrians|Austrian]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]], and even vaguely [[South America]]n persona. Each time, the censors disapproved of his work. Finally, after much experimentation, the actor's [[Theatrical makeup|makeup]] was changed to fair from swarthy, he was told not to gesticulate too much, and he created a nondescript, vaguely European accent (which was nicknamed \"Spenchard\") for his role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaffer|first=George|title=Plays Villain of Five Lands, Then All in One|work=Chicago Tribune|date=September 7, 1937|page=20}}</ref> The accent proved difficult to maintain. During [[long take]]s, D'Arcy would slip into his native [[French language|French]]-inflected voice, forcing these scenes to be reshot multiple times.<ref name=parsonsblowing />\n\nImprovisation could sometimes be a risky choice for the production in other ways as well. Delmar's script called for the film to be set in [[Connecticut]]. The critical plot element had the divorce court judge issue a 90-day [[interlocutory]] [[decree]], and it is during this period in which most of the action in the film occurs. As filming commenced, it became clear that no one knew if Connecticut permitted interlocutory decrees. It turned out that the state did not, and Columbia Pictures' in-house lawyers could not determine which state did. By coincidence, [[David T. Wilentz]], the [[New Jersey Attorney General]], was visiting Los Angeles. McCarey called him on the telephone, and Wilentz confirmed that [[New Jersey]] divorce courts used them. The setting of the film was then changed to New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood Talkie-Talk|work=Baltimore Evening Sun|date=September 22, 1937|page=23}}</ref> Improvisation also led to minor visual inconsistencies in the film, such as when Jerry Warriner appears to both stand and sit during the divorce proceedings.{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=266}}\n\n===Songs and choreography===\nDuring pre-production, McCarey knew that he needed two songs for important scenes in the picture.{{sfn|Eagan|2010|page=266}} Composer [[Ben Oakland]] and lyricist [[Milton Drake]] wrote two numbers for the film, \"I Don't Like Music\" and \"My Dreams Are Gone with the Wind\".{{sfn|Burton|1953|page=99}} Both were finished by the time principal photography began.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parsons|first=Louella O.|title=Warners and Selznick Plan John D.

In a second scene, Dunne's character dances in front of Jerry, his fianc\u00e9e, and her family. Usually, the production would hire a [[choreographer]] for these scenes, but McCarey declined to do so. Instead, he asked an [[African American]] youth working on the Columbia lot to teach Dunne and Grant how to dance. Their inept efforts to imitate him made their on-screen dances funnier.<ref>{{cite news|title=Talk of the Talkies|work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=September 6, 1937|page=17}}</ref> Ralph Bellamy was required to do the fictional \"Balboa Stomp\" in the nightclub scene while Irene Dunne largely stands by, feebly trying to imitate him. The dance proved so physically intimidating that Bellamy lost {{convert|15|lb}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Parsons|first=Louella O.|title=Russell, Once 'Another Loy', Cast With Her|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=July 22, 1937|page=12}}</ref> and his muscles and joints were sore for weeks afterward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kendall|first=Read|title=Around and About Hollywood|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 1937|page=14}}</ref> Irene Dunne choreographed the burlesque dance which her character performs at the Vance mansion to embarrass Jerry. In rehearsal, Leo McCarey asked her to insert a \"[[stripper]] bump\"{{Efn|This is a physical move where the performer swiftly pushes the hips forward suddenly, as if thrusting sexually. It is often performed with the hands behind the head or on the hips.

Dunne replied, \"Never could do that.\" McCarey laughed so hard at her response that he asked her to include it in the performance.{{sfn|Gehring|2006|page=9}}\n\nOne of the film's best remembered comedy moments is when Lucy Warriner accompanies an out of tune Dan Leeson on the piano while he sings \"Home on the Range\".
