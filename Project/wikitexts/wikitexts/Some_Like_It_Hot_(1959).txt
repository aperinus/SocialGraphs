It stars [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]], with [[George Raft]], [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Joe E. Brown]], [[Joan Shawlee]], [[Grace Lee Whitney]] and [[Nehemiah Persoff]] in supporting roles. The screenplay by Wilder and [[I. A. L. Diamond]] is based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan from the 1935 French film ''[[Fanfare of Love]]''. The film is about two musicians who disguise themselves by dressing as women to escape from [[American mafia|mafia]] [[gangsters]] whom they witnessed committing a crime.\n\n''Some Like It Hot'' opened to critical and commercial success and is considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. In 1989, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=Entertainment: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. |access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>\n\nThe film was produced without approval from the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Motion Picture Production Code (Hays Code)]], because it features [[List of LGBT-related films of the 1950s|LGBT-related themes]], including [[cross-dressing]]. The code had been gradually weakening in its scope since the early 1950s, due to greater social tolerance for taboo topics in film, but it was enforced until the mid-1960s.

They work in a [[speakeasy]] owned by [[gangster]] \"Spats\" Colombo. Tipped off by informant \"Toothpick\" Charlie, the police raid the joint. Joe and Jerry escape, but later accidentally witness Spats and his henchmen gunning down \"Toothpick\" and his gang in revenge (inspired by the real-life [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Gene D. |title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder |date=2010 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |page=212 |isbn=978-0813173672 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&pg=PT258}}</ref>\n). Spats and his gang see them as they flee. Broke, terrified, and desperate to get out of town, Joe and Jerry [[Drag (clothing)|disguise themselves as women]] named Josephine and Daphne so they can join Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed (by train) to [[Miami]]. On the train Joe and Jerry befriend Sugar Kane, the band's vocalist and [[ukulele]] player.\n\nJoe and Jerry become obsessed with Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises. Sugar confides to \"Josephine\" that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have taken advantage of her in the past. She hopes to find a gentle, bespectacled millionaire in [[Florida]]. During the forbidden drinking and partying on the train, \"Josephine\" and \"Daphne\" become close friends with Sugar, and struggle to remember that they are supposed to be girls and cannot make passes at her.\n\nOnce in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as millionaire Junior, the heir to [[Shell Oil]], while feigning indifference to her. An actual millionaire, the much-married, aging, mama's-boy Osgood Fielding III, persistently pursues \"Daphne\", whose refusals only increase his appetite. He invites \"her\" for a champagne supper on his yacht, ''New Caledonia''. Joe convinces Jerry to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that \"Junior\" can take Sugar to Osgood's yacht, and pass it off as his own. Once on the yacht, \"Junior\" tells Sugar that [[Psychological pain|psychological trauma]] has left him [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]] and [[Celibacy|frigid]], but that he would marry anyone who could cure him. Sugar tries to arouse him, with considerable success. Meanwhile, \"Daphne\" and Osgood dance the tango (\"[[La Cumparsita]]\") till dawn. When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel, Jerry announces that Osgood has proposed marriage to \"Daphne\" and that he, as Daphne, has accepted, anticipating an instant divorce and huge cash settlement when his ruse is revealed. Joe convinces Jerry that he cannot actually marry Osgood.\n\nThe hotel hosts a conference for \"Friends of Italian Opera\", which is in fact a major meeting of the national crime syndicate, presided over by \"Little Bonaparte\". Spats and his gang recognize Joe and Jerry as the witnesses they have been looking for. Joe and Jerry, fearing for their lives, realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel. Joe conceals his deception from Sugar by telling her, over the telephone, that he, Junior, must marry a woman of his father's choosing and move to [[Venezuela]] for financial reasons. Sugar is distressed and heartbroken. Joe and Jerry evade Spats' men by hiding under a table at the syndicate banquet. \"Little Bonaparte\" has Spats and his men killed at the banquet; again, Joe and Jerry are witnesses and they flee through the hotel. Joe, dressed as Josephine, sees Sugar onstage singing a lament to lost love. He runs onto the platform and kisses her, causing Sugar to realize that Josephine and Junior are the same person.\n\nJerry persuades Osgood to take \"Daphne\" and \"Josephine\" away on his yacht. Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her performance and jumps aboard Osgood's launch just as it is leaving the dock with Joe, Jerry, and Osgood. Joe confesses his deception to Sugar and tells her that he is not good enough for her, but Sugar wants him anyway. Meanwhile, Jerry tries to get out of his promise to marry Osgood, by listing reasons why \"Daphne\" and Osgood cannot marry, ranging from a [[Chain smoking|smoking habit]] to [[infertility]]. Osgood has answers for all of them. Exasperated, Jerry rips off the wig, switches to his normal voice and says \u201cI'm a man!\u201d  Straightfaced, Osgood replies  \"Well, nobody's perfect,\" leaving Jerry speechless..\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Monroe and Curtis in Some Like it Hot.JPG|thumb|Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe in ''Some Like It Hot'']]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Sugar \"Kane\" Kowalczyk, a ukulele player and singer\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Joe/\"Josephine\"/\"Shell Oil Junior\", a saxophone player\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Jerry (Gerald)/\"Daphne\", a double bass player\n* [[George Raft]] as \"Spats\" Colombo, a mobster from Chicago\n* [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] as Agent Mulligan\n* [[Joe E.
