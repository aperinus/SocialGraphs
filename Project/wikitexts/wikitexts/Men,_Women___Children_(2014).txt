Their communication, self-images and relationships are all affected by the technological age, compounding the usual social difficulties people already encounter. These are video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the massive abundance of illicit material available on the internet. Each character and relationship are put to the test.\n\nDonald and Helen Truby are a sexually dissatisfied married couple. She starts having multiple affairs through the social media website Ashley Madison, and he regularly sees escorts through another site. Donald accidentally catches sight of his wife's website, then shows up where she's meeting her latest affair. In a discussion the day after this discovery, both admit to having indiscretions and agree to ignore they ever happened. The Trubys' teenage son Chris, a football player, is aroused by online material not deemed \"normal\" by society. Hoping to have arousal by \"traditional means\", Chris tries to date cheerleader and classmate Hannah. However, as they start to initiate sex, he fails to become aroused, so she tells everyone they did anyway and then breaks up with him.\n\nHannah and her mother Donna come across auditions for a television series one day in the mall. She's ecstatic as her dream is to become famous, but because her mom had showcased her very provocatively on her website, Hannah is disqualified for the show. Later on, Joan takes the website down, realizing her daughter's activity on the site is damaging to Hannah.\n\nTim, a football player, quits to play a [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] following his parents' divorce. He gains a reason for living after dating the introverted Brandy Beltmeyer, who expresses herself on a secret [[Tumblr]] account. The account and Tim's online conversations are discovered by her overprotective mother Patricia, who removes her daughter's online privileges. Tim's father Kent, noticing lewd comments about a [[Facebook]] picture of Tim's mother on his game, confronts him and states she abandoned both of them. He deletes the game and demands Tim play football next year, causing him to get down. Patricia then poses as Brandy and messages to Tim that she is uninterested. Dejected, Tim overdoses on his [[antidepressants]] and nearly dies, which makes Patricia realise her monitoring has gone too far, and she deactivates the surveillance device she used to monitor Brandy.\n\nDonna goes to content awareness meetings run by Patricia to learn about what is legally allowed on her daughter's website. There she meets Kent and starts a relationship with him. After Donna informs him about the website, he initially wants to end the relationship. However, after reconciling with Tim and realizing how difficult it is to be a single parent, Kent reconnects with her.\n\nHannah's co-cheerleader Allison Doss has been starving herself for months over the summer, with the support of an online group. For years she has had a crush on Brandon Lender, a football player, and he finally notices her. Excited, she secretly shares her first kiss with him, and later sex on his insistence, and he treats it casually and with disinterest. Allison develops an [[ectopic pregnancy]], and she miscarries a short time later. Rushed to the hospital, both she and her parents learn about it. Brandon's only concern is about others discovering they had sex. Realizing how selfish Brandon is, Allison throws a rock through his window in the middle of the night.\n\nWe are left with the overall message that humans should remember to be kind to one another.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col begin}}\n* [[Emma Thompson]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> (''voice'') as the narrator\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Helen Truby\n* [[Jennifer Garner]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Patricia Beltmeyer\n* [[Judy Greer]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Donna Clint\n* [[Dean Norris]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Kent Mooney\n* [[Adam Sandler]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Don Truby\n* [[Ansel Elgort]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Tim Mooney\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Brandy Beltmeyer\n* [[J.
