It received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Make Up Your Mind\", which was written and performed by [[Randy Newman]].\n\nThe film depicts a hectic 24 hours in a newspaper editor's professional and personal life. The main story of the day is the murder of a couple of visiting businessmen. The reporters discover evidence suggesting a police cover-up of evidence of the suspects' innocence, and rush to scoop the story in the midst of professional, private and financial chaos.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the workaholic metro editor of the ''New York Sun'', a fictional<ref>The real ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' merged with another paper in 1950, but the film version shares the same [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]]. Since the film's release, [[The New York Sun|a new incarnation]] of the ''Sun'' has appeared, also using the masthead.</ref> New York City tabloid, who loves his job but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, and tries to track down his estranged daughter Deanne in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up.\n\nThe paper's owner Graham Keighley faces dire financial straits, so he has managing editor Alicia Clark, Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks, as she schemes to get a raise in her salary. Alicia is also having an affair with ''Sun'' reporter Carl. Henry's wife Martha, a ''Sun'' reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she dislikes Alicia. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the ''Sun'' and become an assistant managing editor at the ''New York Sentinel'' (based on ''[[The New York Times]]''), which would mean more money and respectability for shorter hours, but may also be too boring for his tastes.\n\nA hot story is circulating the city, involving the murder of two white businessmen in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]]. Two African-American teenagers are arrested for the crime, which both Henry and ''Sun'' columnist Michael McDougal believe to be false charges when they overhear the NYPD discuss the arrest on the ''Sun'' office's police scanner. Henry becomes obsessed with the case, getting others from the ''Sun'' staff to investigate along with him. He blows his job offer at the ''Sentinel'' after he steals information about the case from the editor's notes while being interviewed for the job, reporting it during a ''Sun'' staff meeting. Martha discovers through her friend in the Justice Department that the businessmen were bankers who stole a large sum of money from their largest investor, a trucking company with ties to the Mafia. Henry begins to believe that it was a setup and the Brooklyn boys were likely just caught in the midst of it.\n\nHenry leaves a dinner with Martha and his parents to go to the police station with McDougal to confirm that the boys were not responsible before they print the story. They corner McDougal's police contact Richie, who, through repeated interrogation and the promise of anonymity, admits that the kids are indeed innocent and just happened to be walking by the scene of the crime when they were caught. Henry and McDougal race back to the ''Sun'' office to discover that Alicia has approved the paper's original front-page headline and story stating that the teens were guilty. This results in a physical fight between Henry and Alicia after he tries to stop the presses printing the papers with the wrong information.\n\nMcDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky, whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall.  Martha is rushed to the hospital for an emergency caesarean section due to uterine hemorrhaging. Alicia is brought to the same hospital and has a change of heart. She calls the ''Sun'' office, has the print room stop the run, and the headline is corrected to Henry's suggestion, \"They Didn't Do It\", with McDougal's story, just in time for the following morning's circulation. The movie ends with Martha giving birth to a healthy baby boy, and a morning news radio report states that because of the ''Sun''{{'}}s exclusive story, the Brooklyn teens were released from jail with no charges pressed.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Henry Hackett\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Bernie White\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Alicia Clark\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Martha Hackett\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as McDougal\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Graham Keightley\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Marion Sandusky\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Paul Bladden\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Susan\n* [[Lynne Thigpen]] as Janet\n* [[Jack Kehoe]] as Phil\n* [[Roma Maffia]] as Carmen\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Ray Blaisch\n* [[Michael P.

David said, \"We wanted a regular day, though this is far from regular.\"<ref name= \"Schaefer, Stephen\">{{cite news\n | last = Schaefer\n | first = Stephen\n | title = New edition competes with small screen, too\n | work = [[Boston Herald]]\n | date = March 27, 1994\n }}</ref> They also wanted to \"look at the financial pressures of a paper to get on the street and still tell the truth.\"<ref name= \"Schaefer, Stephen\"/> After creating the character of a pregnant reporter (played by Marisa Tomei in the film) who is married to the metro editor, both of the Koepps' wives became pregnant. Around that time, [[Universal Pictures]] greenlighted the project.\n\nFor his next project after ''[[Far and Away]]'', Ron Howard was looking to do something on the newspaper industry. [[Steven Spielberg]] recommended that he get in touch with David Koepp. Howard intended to pitch an idea to the writer, who instead wanted to talk about how much he loved the script for ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]''. The filmmaker remembers, \"I found that pretty flattering, of course, so I asked about the subject of his work-in-progress. The answer was music to my ears: 24 hours at a tabloid newspaper.\"<ref name= \"Arnold, Gary\">{{cite news\n | last = Arnold\n | first = Gary\n | title = Tabloid press gets the Ron Howard touch in ''The Paper''\n | work = [[Washington Times]]\n | date = March 27, 1994\n }}</ref> Howard read their script and remembers, \"I liked the fact that it dealt with the behind-the-scenes of headlines. But I also connected with the characters trying to cope during this 24-hour period, desperately trying to find this balance in their personal lives, past and present.\"<ref name= \"Uricchio, Marylynn\">{{cite news\n | last = Uricchio\n | first = Marylynn\n | title = Opie's Byline: ''Paper'' Director Ron Howard was drawn to Keaton's Style, Newsroom's Buzz\n | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]\n | date = March 25, 1994\n }}</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the film, Howard made several visits to the ''[[New York Post]]'' and ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' (which would provide the inspiration for the fictional newspaper in the film). He remembers, \"You'd hear stuff from columnists and reporters about some jerk they'd worked with ...

According to David Koepp, \"Anything else would be trying to figure out, 'How would a woman in power behave?' And it shouldn't be about that. It should be about how a person in power behaves, and since that behavior is judged one way when it's a man, why should it be judged differently if it's a woman?\"<ref name= \"Schwager\"/>\n\nHoward met with some of the top newspapermen in New York, including former ''Post'' editor [[Pete Hamill]] and columnists [[Jimmy Breslin]] and [[Mike McAlary]] (who inspired Randy Quaid's character in the movie). They told the filmmaker how some reporters bypass traffic jams by putting emergency police lights on their cars (a trick used in the movie). Hamill and McAlary also can be seen in cameos.<ref name= \"Kurtz, Howard\"/>\n\nHoward wanted to examine the nature of tabloid journalism. \"I kept asking, 'Are you embarrassed to be working at the ''New York Post''? Would you rather be working at ''The Washington Post'' or ''The New York Times''?' They kept saying they loved the environment, the style of journalism.\"<ref name= \"Kurtz, Howard\"/> The model for Keaton's character was the ''Daily News''{{'}} metro editor Richie Esposito. Howard said, \"He was well-dressed but rumpled, mid-to-late 30s, overworked, very articulate and fast-talking. And very, very smart. When I saw him, I thought, that's Henry Hackett. As written.\"<ref name= \"Arnold, Gary\"/>\n\nThe director also was intrigued by the unsavory aspect of these papers. \"They were interested in celebrities who were under investigation or had humiliated themselves in some way. I could see they would gleefully glom onto a story that would be very humiliating for someone. They didn't care about that. If they believed their source, they would go with it happily.\"<ref name= \"Kurtz, Howard\"/>\n\nIn addition to being influenced by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]'s famous stage play ''[[The Front Page]]'', Howard studied old newspaper movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Howard said, \"Every studio made them, and then they kind of vanished. One of the reasons I thought it would make a good movie today is that it feels fresh and different.\"<ref name= \"Dowd, Maureen\">{{cite news\n | last = Dowd\n | first = Maureen\n | title = ''The Paper'' Replates ''The Front Page'' for the 90's\n | work = [[The New York Times]]\n | date = March 13, 1994\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/movies/film-the-paper-replates-the-front-page-for-the-90-s.html\n | access-date = 2010-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nOne of Howard's goals was to cram in as much information about a 24-hour day in the newspaper business as humanly possible. He said, \"I'm gonna get as many little details right as possible: a guy having to rewrite a story and it bugs the hell out of him, another guy talking to a reporter on the phone and saying, 'Well, it's not [[Watergate]] for God's sake.' Little, tiny \u2013 you can't even call them subplots \u2013 that most people on the first screening won't even notice, probably.
