The film stars [[Peter Strauss]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Andrea Marcovicci]] and [[Michael Ironside]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/spacehunter-adventures-forbidden-zone-1970-2|title=SPACEHUNTER - ADVENTURES IN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE - British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk|access-date=April 8, 2015|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073630/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/spacehunter-adventures-forbidden-zone-1970-2|url-status=live}}</ref> The film's executive producer was [[Ivan Reitman]], and it was directed by [[Lamont Johnson]]. The film's music score was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]]. When the film was originally released in theaters it was shown in a polarized, over/under [[3-D film|3-D]] format. The film became part of the 3-D film revival craze of the early 1980s, being widely released after ''[[Comin' at Ya!]]'' (1981). The film is about a bounty hunter who goes on a mission to rescue three women stranded on a brutal planet and meets a vagrant teenage girl along the way.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the early 22nd century, the film opens with the destruction of a space cruise liner by a bolt of nebular lightning. The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women \u2014 Nova, Reena, and Meagan \u2014 who abscond in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails.\n\nIn space, an alert is broadcast for the safe return of the women with a reward of 3,000 mega-credits. A small-time salvage operator named Wolff intercepts the message and heads to the planet. Joining him is his female engineer Chalmers, who learns that the planet, Terra XI, is a failed colony that fell victim to a deadly plague and civil warfare. Wolff risks the dangers, believing that the reward will solve his debt problems.\n\nAfter landing on the barren world, Wolff and Chalmers set out in a [[four-wheel-drive]] vehicle called the Scrambler. Soon, they join a battle in progress between a group of marauders (called the Zoners) and a band of nomads (the Scavs). The Zoners take the women before Wolff can stop them and fly away on jet-powered [[hang glider]]s. Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into The Zone which is ruled by Overdog, their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds that Chalmers \u2014 revealed to be a [[gynoid]] \u2014 has been killed. Wolff continues alone, but he soon catches a teenage Scav, Niki, trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone, and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead.\n\nIn the meantime, the three women are taken before The Chemist, the chief henchman of Overdog who administers pacifying drugs to the women and prepares them for Overdog's pleasure. Overdog is a hideous [[cyborg]] with giant metal claws for hands.\n\nElsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his, a soldier named Washington, who reveals that he, too, has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off of the planet. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself.\n\nStill led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments \u2014 from being attacked by mutated humanoids, to strange Amazon-like women and a water dragon (which the Amazon-like women fear). He loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington, and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. They agree to a 50/50 split of the reward.\n\nNow a team, Wolff and Washington sneak into Overdog's fortress, where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki (who was left out of the rescue for her safety) decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end. Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy, in turn, recharges Overdog.\n\nWolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog's claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the fortress explodes around them, Wolff and Niki run for cover and are rescued by the timely arrival of Washington, who is driving the plow machine with Nova, Reena and Meagan driving another commandeered vehicle. They all race out of the fortress just as it explodes behind them.\n\nWolff invites Niki to stay with him, and she agrees since they made good partners.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Peter Strauss]] as Wolff\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Niki\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Washington\n* [[Andrea Marcovicci]] as Chalmers\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Overdog McNabb\n* Beeson Carroll as Grandman Patterson\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as The Chemist\n* [[Deborah Pratt]] as Meagan\n* Aleisa Shirley as Reena\n* [[Cali Timmins]] as Nova\n* [[Reggie Bennett]] as Barracuda Leader\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Voice On Intercom (Uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in February 1982.<ref>NY CLIPS From the folks who gave you 3-D thrills . . .\nO'Toole, Lawrence.

I was quite relieved when Lamont showed up and said, 'This is awwwful. Let's change all this!' The script was re-written a lot. There was a train which started out as evil and wound up being good.

Wolff was a wonderful, Harrison  Ford type, but that's not Peter. An actor has to take it his own way and do something totally different. Unfortunately, you're working with people who want the Harrison Ford thing, and they want it from you... Peter had to carry his first big feature through all that confusion, and it was very difficult.\"<ref name=\"ernie\"/>\n\nIn regards to the 3D aspect Reitman said in 2015: \"We had to have two cameras. We just shot it in what is now called \u201cnative\u201d 3-D, and it was hell. And there were no screens that you could show it in. That was not really a practical idea in 1981.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Post production===\nThe film's music was done by [[Elmer Bernstein]] who later called the film \"too rushed. The studio's ''only'' concern was getting it to the box office to make quick money, riding an anticipated, lucrative 3-D boom. ... The producers didn't want to \nfool around. They were looking for a more conventional approach. So, I wrote it like a Western with lots of straightforward heroics and a conventional orchestra, except for the [[Ondes Martenot]].\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-103/page/n69/mode/1up?q=spacehunter|page=71|date=February 1986|title=Composer Elmer Berstein|first=Thom|last=Clement}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film's advertising emphasized the 3D aspects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/08/business/advertising-all-sci-fi-s-are-not-all-the-same.html|title=Advertising; All Sci-Fi's Are Not All The Same|last=Salmons|first=Sandra|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1983-06-08|accessdate=2021-05-01|archive-date=May 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524135205/http://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/08/business/advertising-all-sci-fi-s-are-not-all-the-same.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Columbia released ''Spacehunter'' on May 20, 1983, timed to be a week before ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/movies/hollywood-forecast-best-summer-at-box-office.html|title=HOLLYWOOD FORECAST: BEST SUMMER AT BOX OFFICE|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1983-05-16|accessdate=2021-05-01|archive-date=August 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828232705/https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/movies/hollywood-forecast-best-summer-at-box-office.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIt took $7 million in the first week<ref>FILM CLIPS: A LIGHT & MAGIC TOUCH WILL RESCUE 'THE KEEP'\nCaulfield, Deborah.
