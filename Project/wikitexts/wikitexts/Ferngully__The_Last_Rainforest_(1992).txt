Adapted from the \"FernGully\" stories by Diana Young, the film is an Australian and American<ref name=\"BFI\"/> venture produced by [[Kroyer Films]], Inc., Youngheart Productions, [[FAI Films]] and [[20th Century Fox]]. The film stars the voices of [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Jonathan Ward (actor)|Jonathan Ward]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Grace Zabriskie]]. ''FernGully'' is set in an [[Australia]]n [[rainforest]] inhabited by [[Fairy|fairies]] including Crysta, who accidentally shrinks a young [[Lumberjack|logger]] named Zak to the size of a fairy. Together, they rally the fairies and the animals of the rainforest to protect their home from the loggers and Hexxus, a malevolent pollution entity. Wayne Young, the film's producer, said the film was \"blatantly environmental\" though made an effort to avoid \"preaching\".\n\nThe film was released to mainly positive reviews, and was also generally considered a moderate financial success at both the box office and in home video sales. In 1998, it was followed by a [[direct-to-video]] sequel ''[[FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue]]'', though none of the original voice cast reprised their roles.\n\n==Plot==\nCrysta is a [[fairy]] of curious nature who lives in FernGully, a [[picturesque]] rainforest free from human pollution. The fairies of FernGully once lived in harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day, Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty Koda, a [[Megabat|bat]] who claims to have been experimented on by humans, giving him a manic and deluded personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him except for Crysta who volunteers to investigate the situation. She meets Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.\n\nThe tree that Hexxus is imprisoned in is cut down by Zak's supervisors Tony and Ralph. Hexxus quickly begins to regain his powers by feeding on pollution. He manipulates Tony and Ralph to drive to FernGully. In FernGully, Zak meets Pips, a fairy jealous of Zak's relationship with Crysta. Zak begins to fall in love with Crysta, but hides the true reason that the humans had returned. When the signs of Hexxus's resurrection begin to manifest themselves in poisoned trees and rivers, Zak finally admits that humans are destroying the forest. The fairies mount an attempt to defend their homes. Knowing their fight is hopeless, Zak convinces Batty to aid him in stopping the machine before it destroys them. When Zak makes his presence known to Tony and Ralph, Hexxus takes over the machine and begins to wildly destroy the forest.\n\nMagi sacrifices herself to give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to remember everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus the source of his power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Batty, Pips and the rest of the fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta fed Hexxus to start growing wildly. Hexxus and the machine are both simultaneously imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom.\n\nCrysta appears after the fight, having survived and succeeds Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she forlornly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully as Crysta playfully chases Pips with Batty following.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Tim Curry cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|Tim Curry, pictured in 1995, provided the voice for Hexxus, the film's main antagonist|alt=Tim Curry, a Caucasian man with a beard and short brown hair facing the viewer and smiling.

Keith Booker states that ''FernGully'' \"focuses on the theme of the destruction of the Earth's rainforests. In this case the rainforest is located near [[Mount Warning]], on the eastern coast of Australia, but the theme is global and the specific location is not particularly emphasized\". Despite the environmental theme, Booker stated the film was \"somewhat vague in its explanation of the dire consequences of rainforest destruction and it addresses the economic impetus behind this destruction hardly at all\"; the fact that the rainforest was saved at the end of the film \"diminishes the urgency of its environmentalist message\" and that the character of Hexxus \"displaces the real blame for environmental destruction from its real perpetrators onto nonexistent supernatural perpetrators, further diluting the political message.\" The character of Batty was said to introduce \"the secondary theme of animal experimentation, though with a light touch that presents this potentially horrifying motif as essentially humorous.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Booker |first=M.

As Zak is shrunk to fairy size and integrated into the fairy world, more similarities rather than differences are implied with the nonhuman characters. Crysta is said to defeat the evil Hexxus \"in the manner of classic western genre heroes\", though with the key difference that her weapon is a seed rather than a revolver, allowing the produce of nature to share the heroic role with her.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jagtenberg |first1=Tom |last2=McKie |first2=David |date=November 7, 1996 |title=Eco-Impacts and the Greening of Postmodernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaCnBAAAQBAJ&q=%22aimed+at+a+younger+generation%22+%22to+relatively+discredited+genres%22.&pg=PA177 |publisher=Sage Publications |pages=177\u2013178 |isbn=978-0803974074 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nProducer Wayne Young said his passion for the environment was his motivation for making the film, saying the film was \"blatantly environmental, although we have gone to a lot of trouble to avoid preaching. We also want it to be viewed as entertainment.\" The inspiration for ''FernGully'' came from stories written by his former wife, Diana Young.<ref name=\"vanityfair\">{{cite web |date=April 25, 2017 |last=Tattoli |first=Chantel |title=FernGully at 25: How an Upstart Disney Rival Created a Millennial Silent Spring |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/ferngully-making-of |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] }}</ref><ref name=\"portman\" /> Diana first wrote the story of ''FernGully'' 15 years before the film's release. Wayne said the couple planned a film adaptation for five years, then spent \"seven years of dreaming and hustling, followed by another three years of production\". Wayne stated their dream was not possible until the success of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s 1989 film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', which brought popularity back to animation.<ref name=brownstein>{{cite news |last=Brownstein |first=Bill |date=April 16, 1992 |title=It's hip, it's animated, and it's eco-friendly; Cartoon adventure FernGully began with an idea 15 years ago |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |page=F1 |issn=0384-1294 }}</ref> Hand-drawn scenes in the film were complemented by [[computer animation]], which was used to create elements such as [[flocks of birds]] that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally. Kroyer states 40,000 frames of computer-generated graphics were used in the film, and that the use of such animation halved the production time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rickitt|first=Richard|title=Special Effects: The History and Technique| publisher=Billboard Books|year=2000|isbn=0-8230-7733-0|page=147}}</ref> Most of the film's $24 million budget was spent on the animation and the soundtrack.<ref name=\"brownstein\" />\n\nThe film marked [[Robin Williams]]'s first animation role, with the character Batty Koda being created specifically for him. Williams provided 14 hours' worth of improvised lines for the part, which had been originally conceived as an eight-minute role. Director [[Bill Kroyer]] was so impressed with the voice work he ended up tripling the screen time given to the character. Williams went on to provide the voice of the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] in Disney's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' later the same year, receiving critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rusoff |first=Jane Wollman |date=June 9, 1992 |title=Animation gives stars a whole other way to express themselves |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |page=D1 |issn=1082-8850}}</ref> Williams had already agreed to voice Batty Koda before being approached to do ''Aladdin''. [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], then-chairman of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], tried to force Williams to withdraw from ''FernGully'', on the grounds he did not want him voicing two animated characters around the same time, but Williams refused. According to Wayne Young, Disney repeatedly interfered with the production of ''FernGully'', twice taking over spaces the producers had rented by offering to pay more. When the producers eventually set up studio in a former brewery in the [[San Fernando Valley]], Disney attempted to purchase it. Katzenberg declined to comment on the issue when approached by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 2017.<ref name=\"vanityfair\" />\n\nThe voice cast of ''FernGully'' agreed with the film's message, and worked for scale wages.<ref name=\"brownstein\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Wuntch |first=Phillip |date=December 18, 1992 |title=Williams serious about Toys: It's a whimsical response to military mind |newspaper=[[The Province]] |page=C10 |issn=0839-3311 }}</ref><ref name=\"green\">{{cite news |last=Green |first=Tom |date=December 18, 1992 |title=Wild Child: Playful role fits the boyish soul |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |page=01D |issn=0734-7456}}</ref> The film marked the first time that both members of [[Cheech & Chong]] had worked together in six years, with the two voicing beetle brothers Stump and Root.
