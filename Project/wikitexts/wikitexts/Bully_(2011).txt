The film jumps back and forth between the teens to describe their lives. The film starts off by telling the story of Tyler Long and how he died. Tyler\u2019s father speaks about his son\u2019s social issues and how he knew early on that Tyler might become a victim of bullying. Mr. Long mentions that kids took his clothes when he showered, forcing him to leave naked. They shoved him into lockers and demoralized him verbally as well. These actions are said to have led Tyler to commit suicide in 2009, at the age of 17, when his father found him hanging in his closet with a note on the bed.\n\nAlex Libby, who was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], is 12 years old, and is interviewed about his family and how nervous he is to return to school, as he has issues making friends.<ref name=\"Storify (2012)\"/> The cameraman follows him to the bus stop and onto the bus, where the bullying begins and doesn\u2019t stop. The boy sitting beside him on the bus is seen violently threatening him. At school, the camera captures instances of bullying that do not directly pertain to Alex, but do show the principal of the school noticing and simply saying the children should get along but doing little to put an end to it. A boy named Cody is pulled from class to discuss being bullied at lunch, but pulling him out of class was simply a move by the school to give the appearance of attempting to address the issue at hand.\n\nKelby Johnson is a 16 year-old girl who has come out to [[Tuttle, Oklahoma|her hometown]] as a lesbian. She states that she is not welcome anywhere in the town, due to the town\u2019s [[Social conservatism|religious and societal beliefs]]. Kelby states that as she was walking down the road a group of boys hit her with a minivan and did not slow down, knowing it was her. Kelby admits that she used to self-harm and has tried to commit suicide three times now. The family mentions that when Kelby\u2019s sexuality came out even the people they were close with stopped talking to them. During the school year, kids would harass, bully, and ignore her. She mentions that even the teachers would bully her and exclude her from events, like calling her as part of a separate roll call list. Her parents have offered to move several times, but Kelby refuses stating that, \u201cIf I leave, they win.\u201d\n\nJa\u2019Meya Jackson is a 14-year-old teenage girl who lives with her mother. She went to school in [[Yazoo County, Mississippi]]. Ja\u2019Meya is an honor student and talented basketball player. The children harassed and picked on her for quite some time. Even so, Ja\u2019Meya had plans to join the Navy in order to help her mother. She explains that one day she finally had enough and took her mother\u2019s gun to school in an attempt to intimidate her bullies into leaving her alone. It works and the bullies are terrified, but she was then tackled to the ground by another student and arrested by the police.\n\nTyler\u2019s parents used their son\u2019s death to focus on the issue of bullying at the schools in their town. They held a town meeting, trying to find a way to fix the problem and show the schools and the officers that it is a serious problem. The administrators felt that \u201ckids will be kids\u201d and the teachers shrugged it off, not really taking a stance on the problem even when they knew of bullying in the classroom. During the town meeting Tyler\u2019s family arranges for another child to speak up about bullying and how the teachers don\u2019t pay attention; his name is Devon and he used to be bullied in the past.\n\nJa\u2019Meya is told the charges against her will be dropped, if she accepts to be held in a psychiatric hospital for 3 months. After that she will be allowed to go home, unless a doctor states otherwise.\n\nTy Smalley is a younger child who was bullied relentlessly until he committed suicide at age 11. He had been bullied because of his height, as he was quite small at the time. The school officials claim that bullying wasn\u2019t a factor, even though his friend says otherwise. Trey Wallace, his best friend, claims that Ty was extremely sad the last time that he saw him; he said he was crying. They show pieces of Ty\u2019s funeral, including his parents, \u201ctucking in their baby one last time.\u201d Trey is overcome with emotion and cries at Ty\u2019s casket. He later explains that he used to be a bully when he was in second grade, but as he got older he realized the harm and hurt he did to people. He mentions that when he tried to stand up for Ty, the latter would always tell him that, \u201cthey aren\u2019t worth it,\u201d or, \u201cdon\u2019t be like them,\u201d getting Trey to back down.\n\nWe see Kelby rather happy talking about the rain with her current girlfriend. She claims she would not be here, or be able to go to school, without her friends and girlfriend. She refuses to let her bullies \u201cwin\u201d.\n\nAlex is shown being bullied while on the bus. He has been stabbed, punched, and had his life threatened. He claims to not feel anything anymore. The filmmakers, worried about Alex\u2019s well-being, showed the footage to the administrators and his parents, and when his parents confronted the administrators, a handful of students are disciplined and punished through bus suspension. During the school's efforts, students are shown lying about what happened. Alex is told to tell someone if he is bullied again. Alex claims he won't because he told adults in sixth grade and nothing was done.\n\nA few months later, Ja\u2019Meya arrives home with her mother. She is excited to be home again and states how different everything looks.\n\nIt is Alex\u2019s last day of school. Other students are shown being friendly towards him, signing T-shirts, and laughing with him. Kelby\u2019s parents pulled her out of school because on her first day back, everyone moved their desks to be away from her, showing that nothing has changed. Tyler\u2019s family is later shown hosting rallies to gain awareness for the other children around the world who committed suicide due to bullying. Eventually they start an online group and meet others whose children met a similar fate. They start a memorial service called \u201cStand for the Silent\u201d to help reach out to children and adults who are or have been victims of bullying and tackle the problem together.\n\nKelby, while also in attendance, stands for the support of the fallen children. Ty\u2019s parents set off groups of balloons to symbolize the lost lives throughout the country. They give out wristbands to help raise awareness for their cause. Ty\u2019s father stands before the crowd to give a speech, in which he states that he will forever fight against bullies everywhere because, \u201c[his] son will be 11 years old forever.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* Ja'Meya Jackson\n* Kelby Johnson\n* Lona Johnson\n* Bob Johnson\n* Alex Libby\n* Jackie Libby\n* Philip Libby\n* Maya Libby\n* Jada Libby\n* Ethan Libby\n* Logan Libby\n* Kim Lockwood\n* David Long\n* Tina Long\n* Teryn Long\n* Troy Long\n* Devon Matthews\n* Barbara Primer\n* Kirk Smalley\n* Laura Smalley\n* Trey Wallace\n* Tyler Lee Long (archive footage)\n* Mercedes Banks\n* Dean Donehoo\n* Vickie Reed\n* Jeff Johnson\n* Howard Ensley\n* Derek Parker\n* Chloe Albright\n* James Ramsey\n* Paula Crandall\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

I couldn\u2019t enroll people\u2019s support. People would say things like 'get over it,' even my own father and mother. They weren't with me. That was a big part of my wanting to make the film. It's cathartic on a daily basis.\" Hirsch said he hoped the film grows far beyond him, inspiring advocacy, engagement, and empowerment not just in people who are being bullied and in their families, but by those of us who all too often stand by and do nothing. He stated, \"I hope we build something that\u2019s really sustainable. I hope this takes on a life of its own.\"<ref name=\"tcjewfolk\"/>\n\n== MPAA rating ==\nOn February 27, 2012, a Change.org online petition was created, directed to the CEO of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) in order to reduce the movie's [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating]] from R (due to some language as shown in the poster) to PG-13, because the R rating would prevent the intended audience from seeing the film. The filmmakers lost the appeal for a PG-13 rating by one vote. As of March 15, 2012, Butler had collected more than 300,000 signatures, but the MPAA initially hesitated to make the change.
