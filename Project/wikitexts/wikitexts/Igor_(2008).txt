''Igor'', developed and produced by [[Max Howard]] with the California-based Exodus Film Group, was the first feature-length animated film to be financed with [[private equity]]. The animation was completed at France's [[Sparx Animation Studios]] and a facility in Vietnam. It was distributed in North America by [[MGM Distribution Co.]] and internationally by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It is MGM's first fully computer-animated film as well as the studio's first animated film in twelve years following 1996's ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]''.\n\n''Igor'' features the voices of [[John Cusack]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Sean Hayes]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[John Cleese]], [[Molly Shannon]], and [[Christian Slater]]. Conceived by McKenna as a twisting of evil scientist film tropes, ''Igor'' features Cusack as the titular Igor, who lives in the kingdom of Malaria where [[Igor (character)|others of his kind]] serve as assistants to evil scientists. In trying to achieve his dream to become an evil scientist, Igor accidentally creates a sweet female monster named Eva.\n\n''Igor''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first teaser trailer premiered at the 2008 [[New York Comic-Con]] before being released online on May 7, 2008. Promoted with a video game, toys, books, comic books, and fast-food tie-ins, ''Igor'' premiered at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] on September 13, 2008, before starting its American nationwide theatrical run five days later. The film received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $30.7 million worldwide on a $25 million budget. ''Igor'' garnered a [[cult following]] and received an [[Annie Award]] nomination for Val\u00e9rie Hadida's character design.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Kingdom of Malaria was once a peaceful land of farmers until its environment was devastated by a mysterious storm that never ended and killed all of its plantations, thus driving its inhabitants into poverty. In response to this calamity, Malaria's ruler King Malbert initiates a plan to save the country by having the kingdom's best and most wicked scientists create various [[doomsday device]]s and blackmail the rest of the world into paying them by threatening to unleash these devices upon the world. As a result, Malaria becomes a dark country where evil reigns supreme. There is also an annual Evil [[Science fair|Science Fair]] that takes place in an arena known as the Kiliseum, where the inventions fight one another while being broadcast to the rest of the planet. Also, while [[Mad scientist|evil scientist]]s are treated as celebrities, citizens with [[Kyphosis|hunchbacks]] are treated as [[Second-class citizen|second-class]], usually referred to by the derogatory name \"[[Igor (character)|Igor]]\", and are often employed as lowly minions for these scientists.\n\nOne Igor, however, is a talented inventor and smarter than most of Malaria's scientists who aspires to be an evil scientist himself. Among his inventions are his friends Scamper, a re-animated, immortal and suicidal rabbit, and Brain, an unintelligent robot with a human brain transplanted into a [[life support]] jar. Unfortunately, he must keep his talent a secret out of fear of being sent to the \"Igor Recycling Plant\", especially from his master, the incompetent Dr. Glickenstein. Meanwhile, another evil scientist named Dr. [[Schadenfreude]] becomes immensely popular due to winning several Evil Science Fairs in a row. In truth, he always steals the prize-winner from another scientist before the fair with help of his shape-shifting girlfriend, Jaclyn, and desires to overthrow King Malbert and rule Malaria as its new king.\n\nOne day, Glickenstein is visited by his \"girlfriend\" Heidi (who is actually Jaclyn in disguise attempting to steal his plans), giving Igor aspirations of romance. After throwing out Heidi, Glickenstein ignores Igor's concerns of using better parts for his latest invention, which is a rocket ship that malfunctions and explodes, taking Glickenstein with it. At this same moment, King Malbert arrives to see Glickenstein and demand that he builds an invention that could defeat Schadenfreude, who Malbert fears will replace him as king due to his popularity. Unable to tell the truth of Glickenstein's death and seizing the opportunity, Igor boldly claims that Glickenstein is creating life, which greatly pleases Malbert, who proclaims that such an invention would make its creator the greatest evil scientist of all time. After the king leaves, Igor reveals to Scamper and Brain his project to create a huge and [[Frankenstein's monster|monstrous being from human remains]].\n\nWith Brain and Scamper's help, he assembles the giant, and adds an \"evil bone\" that will make it pure evil. It first seems his experiment failed but seconds later, the [[monster]] reveals to have come alive and later escapes. They later find the giantess in an orphanage playing with blind orphans. At the same time, Schadenfreude sneaks into Glickenstein's castle to steal his invention, but he not only discovers that Glickenstein is dead, but his Igor had created a living monster, which he believes will be his key to taking the throne.\n\nIgor manages to lead the giant back to the castle with flowers that she likes. There, he discovers that the evil bone he gave her was not activated, making the monster sweet, friendly and gentle despite being hideous. Igor attempts to activate the evil bone by commanding the monster to kill a fly, but she instead catches it and sets it outside. Igor tries to convince the monster that she is evil but fails as the gentle [[giantess]] misinterpreted it as \"Eva\", thinking that's the name he gave her. Igor later attempts to [[mind control|brainwash]] Eva into becoming evil by bringing her to a brainwashing salon. Brain also decides to get his brain cleaned and to watch TV but breaks the remote to his TV, so he takes the remote from Eva's room and, in an attempt to change the channel, inadvertently changes the monster's TV channel from a horror movie marathon to a talk show whose topic of the day is the history of acting. She ends up watching the talk show for several hours and upon leaving the salon, she can speak proper English and aspires to be an actress.\n\nIgor then reluctantly takes his creation back to the castle in their car, bemoaning his failures. On the way back to the castle, Schadenfreude chases after Igor in an attempt to steal Eva by using a shrink ray, only to fail and end up shrinking himself. Igor and his friends nearly go over a cliff, but Eva saves them all, showing her appreciation of all life. Brain then brags on about how he changed the channel for Eva's TV, thus admitting that he made her what she is. Upon learning this, Igor attempts to kill Brain with an axe in anger for ruining his monster. When Eva questions this, Scamper sarcastically tells her they're practicing for a play and the monster believes that they're performers. Igor then gets the idea to exhibit Eva at the science fair while lying to her that the fair is an \"[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]\" audition with a few differences. While helping Eva with the \u201cplay\u201d, Igor slowly starts to fall for her, who tries to convince him that its always better to be good than evil, no matter how much more successful evil is.\n\nDr. Schadenfreude takes Igor to his home revealing he knows about Glickenstein's death and Eva, so he offers a compromise, if Igor gives him Eva to overthrow King Malbert he will make Igor Malaria's number one scientist, but Igor refuses forcing Schadenfreude to refute to blackmail. Igor narrowly escapes but is too late to stop Schadenfreude from exposing Igor to the King who sends him to the \"Igor Recycling Plant\". Schadenfreude tricks Eva into coming with him by having Jaclyn (again disguised as Heidi) pretend to kiss Igor.\n\nAt the fair, Schadenfreude manipulates Eva into striking him, activating her evil bone and turning her into a mindless killing machine. He unleashes the monster on the Science Fair where she destroys all the Evil Inventions whilst singing a rendition of \"[[Tomorrow (song from Annie)|Tomorrow]]\". Brain and Scamper help Igor escape from the plant and learn that Malbert had deliberately killed Malaria's crops with a weather ray that created the storm clouds so he could implement his \"Evil Inventions\" plan, thereby keeping himself in power. Rushing into the arena, Igor tries to reason with the enraged Eva while Brain and Scamper power down the weather ray. Eva roars furiously at Igor until the sunlight begins to shine once again on Malaria, which permanently deactivates her evil bone and returns her to her sweet and gentle self.\n\nIgor exposes Malbert's lies to the public, telling them they do not need to be evil. The crowd boos at Malbert for his treachery before the damaged weather ray falls and crushes him to death. Dr. Schadenfreude attempts to take power, but Eva humiliates him. Malaria returns to its sunny peaceful ways with the monarchy dissolved and replaced with a [[republic]] with Igor as the president. Schadenfreude is reduced to a pickle salesman and Jaclyn, who's revealed to be a female Igor, loses her shapeshifting ability and becomes a pretzel saleswoman (while starting a relationship with Schadenfreude's Igor) while the annual science fair becomes an annual [[musical theatre]] showcase. Igor reveals his plan to build a dog to Eva, with her remarking that they'll just adopt if it doesn't work out. Igor and Eva live happily together as Malaria becomes a better place.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[John Cusack]] as Igor, a short [[hunchback]] who aspires to be an evil scientist.\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Eva, the hideous, yet sweet [[monster]] Igor makes using human remains, that aspires to be an actress.

Since none of the Vietnamese animators could speak English, Leondis recorded videotapes of himself doing character movements and the voice actors doing their lines; and the Vietnamese workers would animate the characters with the tapes as references. According to Howard, \"It was a real buzz to go out there and see our artwork come to life on their monitors.

the Paris office [[Box modelling|modelled]] and [[Skeletal animation|rigged]] the characters, and the Vietnamese space modelled the props and sets.<ref name = \"CWG\"/> A 3D animatic was done in the next four months by six animators and two camera people, with two-and-a-half of those months involving revisions of the animatic.<ref name = \"CWG\"/> The following six months, 50 of the Vietnamese workers animated the film before it was taken to the Paris office for the lighting and final compositing to be done with [[Digital Fusion]].<ref name = \"CWG\"/> According to Sparx manager Jean-Philippe Again, each animator completed an average of 0.6 seconds of animation.<ref name = \"CWG\"/> Rending was done with another [[Autodesk]] program, [[Mental Ray]];
