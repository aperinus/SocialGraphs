The film tells the story of a [[schizophrenic]] young woman (Andersson) vacationing on a remote island with her husband (von Sydow), novelist father (Bj\u00f6rnstrand), and frustrated younger brother (Passg\u00e5rd).\n\nBergman structured the film as a [[Three act structure|three-act]] play, drawing on his personal experiences and relationships. The film was his first of several shot on the island of [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]], at the recommendation of cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]]. The score incorporates the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Themes explored include the equation of God with love, exploitation in art, psychosis, and sexuality.\n\n''Through a Glass Darkly'' was released to positive reviews, specifically for Andersson's performance, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films ''[[Winter Light]]'' and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story takes place during a 24-hour period while four family members take their vacation on a remote island, shortly after one of them, Karin, is released from an asylum where she has been treated for [[schizophrenia]]. Karin's husband Martin (von Sydow), a respected doctor, tells her father David (Bj\u00f6rnstrand) that Karin's disease is almost incurable. Meanwhile, Minus (Passg\u00e5rd), Karin's 17-year-old brother, tells Karin that he wishes he could have a real conversation with his father and feels deprived of his father's affection. David is a [[novelist]] suffering from \"[[writer's block]]\" who has just returned from a long trip abroad. He announces he will leave again in a month, though he promised he would stay. The others perform a play for him that Minus has written. David, while feigning approval of the play, takes offence since the play can be interpreted as an attack on his character.\n\nThat night, after rejecting Martin's [[Eroticism|erotic]] overtures, Karin wakes up and follows the sound of a [[foghorn]] to the attic. She faints after an episode in which she [[Auditory hallucination|hears voices]] behind the peeling wallpaper. She then enters David's room and looks through his desk and finds his diary, seeing he described her disease as incurable. She discovers his callous desire to record the details of her deterioration. The following morning, David and Martin, while fishing, confront each other over Karin. Martin accuses David of sacrificing his daughter for his art and of being [[Narcissism|self-absorbed]], callous, cowardly, and phony. David is evasive but admits that much of what Martin says is true. David says that he recently tried [[Suicide|to kill himself]] by driving over a cliff but was saved by a faulty [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. He says that after that, he discovered that he loves Karin, Minus and Martin, and this gives him hope. Meanwhile, Karin tells Minus about her episodes, and that she is waiting for God to appear behind the wallpaper in the attic. Minus is somewhat sexually frustrated, and Karin teases him, even more so after she discovers that he hides a [[pornographic magazine]]. Later, on the beach, when Karin sees that a storm is coming, she runs into a wrecked ship and huddles in fear. Minus goes to her and they engage in [[incest]]uous sexual activity.\n\nMinus tells the other men about the incident in the ship and Martin calls for an ambulance. Karin asks to speak with her father alone. She confesses her misconduct toward Martin and Minus, saying that a voice told her to act that way and also to search David's desk. She tells David she would like to remain at the hospital, because she cannot go back and forth between two realities but must choose one. While they are packing to go to the hospital, she runs to the attic where Martin and David observe her actions. She says that God is about to walk out of the closet door, and asks her husband to allow her to enjoy the moment. She becomes fixated on a crack in the wall out of which a spider emerges. The ambulance, a helicopter, flies by the window, making a lot of noise and shaking the door open. Karin moves toward the door eagerly but then she runs from it, terrified, and goes into a frenzy of panic. Karin vanishes and, reappearing in a frenzy, is sedated. When she stands, she tells them of God: an evil-faced spider who tried to penetrate her. She looked into God's eyes, and they were \"cold and calm,\" and when God failed to penetrate her he retreated onto the wall. \"I have seen God,\" she announces.\n\nKarin and Martin leave in the helicopter. Minus tells his father that he is afraid, because when Karin had grabbed him in the ship, he began leaving ordinary reality. He asks his father if he can survive that way. David tells him he can if he has \"something to hold on to\". He tells Minus of his own hope: [[love]]. David and his son discuss the concept of love as it relates to God, and they find solace in the idea that their own love may help sustain Karin. Minus is grateful and in awe that he finally had a real conversation with his father, uttering: \"Papa spoke to me\".\n\n==Themes==\nThe genre of \"family drama\" is one analytic approach, with academic Frank Gado referring to Minus as the \"consciousness\" of this portrayal of family.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=272}} The tense relationship between the family members is revealed in the meal scene, where David's children are dismayed by his intentions to leave soon after returning to the family, placing a damper on the joy of the occasion.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=90\u201391}} Minus expresses his desire, \"I wish I could talk to Papa just once\".{{sfn|Young|2015|p=91}} Minus' play also reveals conflicts. Gado wrote that the [[story within a story]] takes place in Saint Teresa's Chapel, with [[Teresa of \u00c1vila|Saint Teresa]] having used the \"[[The Interior Castle|interior castle]]\" as a symbol of the soul.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=272}} While appearing to be \"Gothic nonsense\", Gado argued that Minus was attempting to tell David that he has always fallen short of greatness as a writer, and that Minus' character uses art to explain his failings in love, in much the same way David retreats to writing to avoid being with Karin. Gado further argued that David's blindfolding before the performance signifies his eyes opening to reality.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=273}}\n\nThe fact that David plans to use Karin's condition as a source for his writing creates a \"portrait of the artist as charlatan, windbag, and heartless exploiter\", essayist Peter Matthews wrote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/296-through-a-glass-darkly-patron-saint-of-angst |title=Through a Glass Darkly: Patron Saint of Angst |last=Matthews |first=Peter |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=17 October 2017 |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref> In the end, when David shares his thoughts of love as God to Minus, Gado believed Minus is most impressed not by the theory but the \"face to face\" encounter with his father and the sharing of love, signified in Minus' closing line \"Papa spoke to me\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=271}}\n\nIn Karin's relationship with her husband, [[psychiatrist]] Barbara Young wrote Karin appears \"withdrawn\" sexually from Martin, but her sexuality is \"still alive in her psychosis\".{{sfn|Young|2015|p=91}} Young observed what she described as a \"[[Flirting|flirtatious]]\" relationship she has with Minus, and when she hears voices, she \"massages her thighs in a sexual way\".{{sfn|Young|2015|p=91}} Her sexuality and knowledge of Minus' [[sexual frustration]] is what leads her to [[incest]] with Minus, and why they defy the [[incest taboo]], Young wrote.{{sfn|Young|2015|p=92}} She believed it was this episode of incest that finally led Karin to realize that she \"can't live in two worlds\".{{sfn|Young|2015|p=92}}\n\n{{Listen|filename=Q 2008-02-14 Paul of Tarsus.ogg |title=A reading of 1 Corinthians 13  |description=}}\nKarin envisions God as a \"[[Cultural depictions of spiders|spider-god]]\". Bergman's next film, ''Winter Light'' explains the metaphor when the character Tomas, played by Bj\u00f6rnstrand, relates the spider-god to suffering, as opposed to his previous ideas of a God of love that provides comfort.{{sfn|Pamerleau|2009|p=123}} The story ends with a discussion of how God is love, a question further explored in ''Winter Light'', which asks if understanding God is as simple as that.{{sfn|Gervais|2001|p=77}} One ''Winter Light'' character mocks the idea of God as love, quoting the end of ''Through a Glass Darkly'' exactly.{{sfn|Gervais|2001|p=78}} The title ''Through a Glass Darkly'' is derived from [[1 Corinthians 13]], which Gado observed also follows themes of \"faith, hope and love\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=267}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Kabi-Laretei-Ingmar-Bergman.jpg|200px|thumb|Bergman's relationship with his wife [[K\u00e4bi Laretei]] influenced the film, which is dedicated to her.]]\nAfter [[Ingmar Bergman]] made notes on his ideas for the film in his diary, drawing on his personal experiences in planning to meet and reconcile with his parents Karin and [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik Bergman]],{{sfn|Young|2015|p=96}} Ingmar wrote the screenplay on the island of [[Tor\u00f6]] in the [[Stockholm archipelago]].{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=40}} He imagined it as a three-act play, where the acts serve as \"mirror panels,\" showing the same thing from different angles.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=267}} This led to the phrase from the Biblical passage [[1 Corinthians 13]] being used as the film's title.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=267}}\n\nBergman claimed the inspiration for the character of Karin was a woman he had lived with when he was younger. He reported she heard voices telling her to do things.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=272}} The scene where David describes his [[attempted suicide]] is also inspired by Bergman's real-life attempt in Switzerland, before making ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' in 1955.{{sfn|Hart|2008|p=113}} Bergman explained that \"while I was preparing the film, I became interested in the human drama surrounding another human being who really was in the process of slipping away\".{{sfn|Vermilye|2002|p=111}} He also referred to his screenplay as \"a desperate attempt to present a simple philosophy: God is love, and love is God\".{{sfn|Young|2015|p=89}} Bergman later regretted that message as lacking truth,{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=25}} and acknowledged that the optimistic epilogue was \"tacked loosely onto the end,\" causing him to feel \"ill at ease\" when later confronted with it.<ref name=\"My Life in Film\">{{cite book |last1=Bergman |first1=Ingmar |title=My Life in Film |date=1990 |publisher=Arcade|page=243}}</ref> He added that \"I was touching on a divine concept that is real, but then smeared a diffuse veneer of love all over it.\"<ref name=\"My Life in Film\"/>\n\nWhile working on ''Through a Glass Darkly'', he was adapting ''[[The Seagull]]'' by [[Anton Chekhov]] in the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], and borrowed an idea from ''The Seagull'' in having Minus write a play.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=272}} Bergman dedicated the film to his then-wife [[K\u00e4bi Laretei]],{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=40}} with influence from what he described as their \"complicated, staged relationship\".{{sfn|Hart|2008|p=113}}\n\n===Casting===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

''[[Winter Light]]'' and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'', and focuses on spiritual issues.  Bergman writes, \"These three films deal with reduction. ''Through a Glass Darkly'' \u2013 conquered certainty. ''Winter Light'' \u2013 penetrated certainty. ''The Silence'' \u2013 God's silence \u2013 the negative imprint.
