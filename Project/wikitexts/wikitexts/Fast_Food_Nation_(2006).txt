The film, an international co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom, is loosely based on Schlosser's bestselling 2001 non-fiction book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nDon Anderson is the Mickey's hamburger chain marketing director who helped develop the \"Big One\", its most popular menu item. When he learns that independent research has discovered a considerable presence of [[Feces|fecal matter]] in the meat, he travels to the fictitious town of Cody, [[Colorado]] to determine if the local Uni-Globe meatpacking processing plant, Mickey's main meat supplier, is guilty of sloppy production. Don's tour shows him only the pristine work areas and most efficient procedures, assuring him that everything the company produces is immaculate.\n\nSuspicious of the fa\u00e7ade he's been shown, Don meets rancher Rudy Martin, who used to supply cattle to the Uni-Globe plant. Rudy and his Chicana housekeeper both assure him that because of the plant's production level, several safety regulations are ignored or worked against; workers have no time to make sure that the manure coming from the intestines stays away from the meat. Don later meets with Harry Rydell, executive VP of Mickey's, who admits being aware of the issue, but is not concerned.\n\nAmber is a young, upbeat employee of Mickey's, studying for college and living with her mother Cindy. While her life seems to be set, she continually faces the contrast between her current career and her own ambition, emphasized by her two lazy co-workers, Brian and Andrew, who, having heard of armed robberies at fast food restaurants in the area, start planning their own.\n\nAmber and Cindy are visited by Cindy's brother Pete, who encourages Amber to leave town and start a real career. Amber eventually meets a group of young activists, Andrew, Alice, and Paco, who plan to liberate cattle from Uni-Globe as their first act of rebellion. They proceed to sneak up to a holding pen at the plant, but after breaking down the fence, they are shocked that the cattle make no attempt to leave. Upon hearing the police, they retreat and contemplate why the cattle decided to stay in confinement.\n\nRaul, his love interest Sylvia, and Sylvia's sister Coco are [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] from [[Mexico]], trying to make it in Colorado. They all go to Uni-Globe in hopes of finding a job \u2013 Raul becomes a cleaner, while Coco works on a meat processing conveyor belt. Sylvia, however, cannot take the environment, and instead finds a job as a hotel maid. Coco develops a drug habit, and begins an affair with her exploitative superior, Mike.\n\nIn a work accident, a friend of Raul's falls in a machine, and his leg is mangled. Raul, attempting to save him, falls and is injured. At the hospital, Sylvia is told that Raul was on [[amphetamine]]s at work. Because Raul is now unable to work, Sylvia has sex with Mike in order to find a job at Uni-Globe. She ends up working on the \"kill floor.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Cindy\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Mike\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Brian\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Benny\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Pete\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Amber\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Don Anderson\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Rudy Martin\n* [[Avril Lavigne]] as Alice\n* [[Esai Morales]] as Tony\n* [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]] as Sylvia\n* [[Lou Taylor Pucci]] as Gerald 'Paco'\n* [[Ana Claudia Talanc\u00f3n]] as Coco\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Raul\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Harry Rydell\n* Matt Hensarling as Kevin\n* [[Aaron Himelstein]] as Andrew\n* [[Cherami Leigh]] as Kim\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Debi Anderson\n* [[Ellar Coltrane]] as Jay Anderson\n* [[Glen Powell]] as Steve\n* [[Marco Perella]] as Tom Watson\n* [[Roger Cudney]] as Terry\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Houston]], [[Texas]], and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], as well as in [[Mexico]].

The site's consensus states, \"Despite some fine performances and memorable scenes, ''Fast Food Nation'' is more effective as Eric Schlosser's eye-opening non-fiction book than as Richard Linklater's fictionalized, mostly punchless movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |title = Fast Food Nation (2006) |url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fast_food_nation/ |website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date = April 29, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fast-food-nation|title=Fast Food Nation Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=January 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said about the film, \"while it does not shy away from making arguments and advancing a clear point of view, is far too rich and complicated to be understood as a simple, high-minded [[polemic]]. It is [[Didacticism|didactic]], yes, but it's also [[dialectic]]al. While the climactic images of slaughter and butchery \u2014 filmed in an actual abattoir \u2014 may seem intended to spoil your appetite, Mr. Linklater and Mr. Schlosser have really undertaken a much deeper and more comprehensive critique of contemporary American life ... The movie does not neglect the mute, helpless suffering of the cows, but it also acknowledges the status anxiety of the managerial class, the aspirations of the working poor (legal and otherwise) and the frustrations of the dreaming young. It's a mirror and a portrait, and a movie as necessary and nourishing as your next meal.\"<ref>{{cite news |first = A. O. |last = Scott |author-link = A. O.

It doesn't hold together or grip you the way a documentary might have. The people are sketchily drawn \u2013 just when you start to care about one of them, he or she vanishes.
