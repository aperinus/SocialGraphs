The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|18th Disney animated feature film]], it is based on [[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[T. H. White]], first published in 1938 and then revised and republished in 1958 as the first book of White's Arthurian [[tetralogy]] ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. Directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the film features the voices of [[Rickie Sorensen]], [[Karl Swenson]], [[Junius Matthews]], [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[Norman Alden]], and [[Martha Wentworth]]. It was the last animated film from Walt Disney Productions to be released in Walt Disney's lifetime.\n\nDisney first acquired the film rights to the novel in 1939, and there were various attempts at developing the film over the next two decades before production on the film officially began. [[Bill Peet]] wrote the story for the film, while the songs were written by the [[Sherman Brothers]]. This was the first animated Disney film to feature songs by the Sherman Brothers; they went on to contribute music to such Disney films as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' (1977). [[George Bruns]] composed the film's [[film score|score]], following his work on the previous two animated Disney films, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959) and ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961). He also composed the scores of the next three animated Disney films, ''The Jungle Book'', ''The Aristocats'', and ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973).\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, but became a box-office success. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1983, as a [[double bill]] with the animated cartoon short ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]''. A [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action remake]] entered development in 2015 and is set to be directed by [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] and released on [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Disney's 'Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake Finds Director (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-remake-disney-hires-director-1075997|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 19, 2018|access-date=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 633 words. -->\nWhen [[King]] Uther Pendragon dies leaving no heir to the throne, a sword magically appears in an anvil, itself embedded in a stone, with an inscription proclaiming that whoever removes the sword is the rightful King of England. None succeed in removing the sword, which becomes forgotten, leaving [[England]] in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].\n\nYears later, an 11-year-old orphan named Arthur, who is given the nickname Wart, accidentally scares off a deer his older foster brother [[Sir Kay]] was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into the forest. While retrieving the arrow, Arthur meets [[Merlin]], an elderly [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who lives with his talking pet [[owl]] Archimedes. Merlin declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with him to his home, a castle run by [[Sir Ector]], Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, [[Pellinore|Sir Pellinore]], arrives with the news that the winner of the upcoming [[New Year's Day]] tournament in [[London]] will be crowned king. Ector decides Kay will be a contestant, and appoints Arthur to be Kay's [[squire]].\n\nTo educate Arthur, Merlin transforms them both into fish and they swim in the castle moat to learn about [[physics]]. Arthur is attacked by a [[northern pike|pike]], but uses his wits to avoid being eaten and is saved by Archimedes. After the lesson, Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment after he attempts to relate what happened to Ector and Kay. Merlin enchants the dishes to wash themselves and takes Arthur out again.\n\nFor the next lesson, Merlin turns them into [[squirrels]] to learn about gravity.  The lesson is sidetracked again, this time by an amorous Girl Squirrel who takes an interest in Arthur.  Merlin finds this amusing until a Granny Squirrel begins chasing ''him''.  Once again, Arthur narrowly avoids being eaten.  Merlin returns them to human form, leaving the Granny Squirrel shocked and the Girl Squirrel in tears.  Back at the castle, Ector accuses Merlin of using black magic on the dishes. Arthur defends Merlin, and Ector punishes Arthur by giving Kay another squire, Hobbs.\n\nResolving to make amends, Merlin plans on educating Arthur full-time. However, Merlin's knowledge of future events, such as trains, planes, and the revelation that Earth is round, confuses the boy, prompting Merlin to appoint Archimedes as Arthur's teacher. Merlin transforms Arthur into a sparrow and Archimedes teaches him how to fly. A [[hawk]] chases Arthur and he seeks refuge in the house of Madam Mim, an eccentric, evil [[witch]]. She decides to destroy Arthur, but Merlin arrives to rescue him. Mim challenges Merlin to a wizards' duel and, despite Mim's cheating, Merlin outsmarts her by transforming into a germ and infecting her, illustrating the importance of knowledge over strength.\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], Kay is knighted. When Hobbs comes down with the [[mumps]], Ector reinstates Arthur as Kay's squire. Arthur's delight at this turn of events causes Merlin to think he cares more about war games than his education. Arthur defends himself, and in a fit of anger Merlin flies off to 20th-century [[Bermuda]].\n\nAt the tournament, Arthur realizes he left Kay's sword at the inn. He finds the doors locked, but Archimedes sees the \"Sword in the Stone\", though unaware of its significance.  Arthur removes the sword from the anvil almost effortlessly, fulfilling the prophecy. When Arthur returns with the sword, Ector recognizes it and the tournament is halted. Ector places the sword back in its anvil, demanding Arthur prove that he pulled it. Kay attempts to pull the sword himself first, prompting the other knights to insist Arthur be given a chance. Arthur pulls it again, revealing that he is England's rightful king. Ector apologizes to Arthur as the knights cheer for him.\n\nLater, the newly crowned [[King Arthur]] sits in the throne room with Archimedes, feeling unprepared for the responsibility of ruling. Merlin returns from his vacation in Bermuda and resolves to help Arthur become the great king he has foreseen him to be.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- Do not add links to pages that have not been written yet, per [[WP:REDNOT]].

An additional animation technique, \"touch-up\", was created during production to replace the [[Cleanup (animation)|clean-up]] process. The clean-up process had required assistant animators to transfer the directing animators' sketches onto new sheets of paper, which were then copied onto the animation cels. To do a touch-up, the assistants would instead draw directly on the animators' sketches. This streamlined the process, but it also caused assistants of directing animator Milt Kahl to fear they would ruin his linework.<ref>{{cite web|last=Korkis|first=Jim|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/11932/Floyd_Norman_Remembers_The_Sword_in_the_Stone_Part_Two|title=Floyd Norman Remembers The Sword in the Stone: Part Two|website=MousePlanet|date=November 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Sword in the Stone'' premiered in London on December 12, 1963.

Merlin was voiced by [[Hamilton Camp]], and appears in the episode \"Rent Day\". Wart also made a few appearances in the series, usually seen in crowd shots with Merlin. He also appears with Merlin in the audience in the episode: \"Mickey vs. Shelby\" after a cartoon ends. Sir Kay was seen in the episode \"Ask Von Drake\", when he tries to pull the sword from the stone with Arthur, Merlin, and Madam Mim. Madam Mim appears as a villain in the spin-off film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. In the past, Merlin frequented the Disney Parks, the only character from the film appearing occasionally for meet-and-greets at [[Disneyland Resort]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. He appeared in the opening unit of [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland Park]]. He also hosts the ''Sword in the Stone'' ceremony in the [[King Arthur Carrousel]] attraction in [[Fantasyland]] at [[Disneyland]]. In 2014 and 2015, UK health directive [[Change4Life]] incorporated \"Higitus Figitus\" as the soundtrack for adverts promoting their Disney-sponsored \"10 minute shake up\" summer program.\n\n===Comics===\n[[File:Madam Mim.gif|thumb|Madam Mim]]\n\nIn the [[Disney comics]], Madam Mim was adopted into the [[Donald Duck universe]], where she sometimes teams with [[Magica De Spell]], [[Witch Hazel (Disney)|Witch Hazel]] and/or the [[Beagle Boys]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64|date=2015|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn=978-1605490458|page=192}}</ref> She also appeared in the [[Mickey Mouse universe]], where she teamed with [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] on occasion and with the [[Phantom Blot]] at one point. She was in love with [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] in several stories; in others, with [[Phantom Blot]]. In the comics produced in Denmark or in the Netherlands, she lost her truly evil streak, and appears somewhat eccentric, withdrawn and morbid, yet relatively polite.\n\nMim appeared in numerous comics produced in the United States by Studio Program in the 1960s and 1970s,<ref>First is in S 65051, according to the [[Inducks]]</ref> often as a sidekick of Magica. Most of the stories were published in Europe and South America. Among the artists are Jim Fletcher, [[Tony Strobl]], Wolfgang Sch\u00e4fer, and Katja Sch\u00e4fer. Several new characters were introduced in these stories, including Samson Hex, an apprentice of Mim and Magica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=Samson+Hex|title=Samson Hex - I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|website=coa.inducks.org}}</ref>\n\nMerlin ({{lang-it|Mago Merlino}}), Archimedes ({{lang-it|Anacleto}}) and Mim ({{lang-it|Maga Mag\u00f2}})'s debut in the prolific Italian Disney comics scene was in a greatly remembered story: \"Mago Merlino presenta: Paperino e la 850\" ({{lit|The Wizard Merlin presents: Donald Duck and the 850}}), published in nine parts in ''[[Topolino]]'' \"libretto\" #455-#464 (16 August-18 October 1964). In the story, [[Scrooge McDuck]] charged [[Donald Duck]] and [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] with delivering a special gas to power the [[Olympic torch]] at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], passing through the World's most disparate climates to test its properties. Unfortunately, Donald's car, the 313, breaks down, but Merlin materializes and magically creates a [[Fiat 850]] ([[Fiat]] was sponsoring the story). Mim, however, wants to obtain the gas, and has the Beagle Boys chase after them. The 850 (initially put in contrast with the villains' generic, [[Edsel]]-like car), thanks to Merlin's magic, displays remarkable characteristics that help the ducks successfully finish their mission.\n\n===Video games===\nMadam Mim made a surprise appearance in the video game ''[[World of Illusion]]'' as the fourth boss of the game.\n\nMerlin is a supporting character in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts|developer=Square|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|date=November 15, 2002|platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref> In ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', Merlin, who lives in an abandoned shack in Traverse Town with [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]'s [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]], is sent by [[Mickey Mouse|King Mickey]] to train Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the art of magic. He owns an old book that features the world of The Hundred Acre Wood, home of Winnie the Pooh. The book's pages, however, have been torn out and scattered across the universe, so Merlin asks Sora to retrieve them for him. He reprises the same role in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', as a figment of Sora's memories.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Merlin, now voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]],<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=Square|publisher=Square Electronic Arts|date=December 22, 2005|platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref> has moved to Hollow Bastion to aid Leon's group as part of the town's restoration committee, though he is at odds with Cid, who prefers his own computer expertise over Merlin's magic. Merlin again instructs Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the art of magic, and again requests that they retrieve the stolen parts of the Pooh storybook. At one point in the game, he is summoned to Disney Castle by [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]] to counter the threat of [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], and he constructs a door leading to Disney Castle's past (Timeless River) for the trio to explore and stop Maleficent and Pete's plans.\n\nIn the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', Merlin encounters Terra, Aqua, and Ventus and grants them each access to the Hundred Acre Wood. The prequel also reveals that it was Terra who gave him the book in the first place after finding it in Radiant Garden. According to series creator [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a world based on ''The Sword in the Stone'' was initially to appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but the idea was scrapped. Merlin returns in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', where he asks Sora to restore Pooh's storybook once more (though it does not involve finding any missing pages), but his involvement in the story is minimal beyond that, and he mostly spends his time at Remy's bistro in Twilight Town having tea.\n\nMerlin appears in the [[City-building game|world builder]] video game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'' as the guide for the player during the game progress, and as the owner of Merlin's Shop, where the players can buy and sell in-game items, as well as other options that Merlin can perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0lYJgim7zc&ab_channel=DisneyMagicKingdoms |title=Update 9: Beauty and the Beast {{!}} Livestream|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Live-action film adaptation===\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action feature film adaptation]] entered development in July 2015, with [[Bryan Cogman]] writing the script and [[Brigham Taylor]] serving as producer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sword-stone-live-action-remake-809845|title='Sword in the Stone' Live-Action Remake in the Works With 'Game of Thrones' Writer (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=July 20, 2015|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> By January 2018, [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] was announced as director.<ref name=\"Director\"/>\n\n===Live-action film spin-off===\nOn October 15, 2021, Disney announced a live-action adaptation of [[T.
