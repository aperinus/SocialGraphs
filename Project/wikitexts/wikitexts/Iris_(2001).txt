Directed by [[Richard Eyre]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Charles Wood (playwright)|Charles Wood]], the film is based on Bayley's 1999 memoir ''[[Elegy for Iris]]''.<ref name=\"Bayley\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/18/1| title=Iris|date=18 January 2002|author=Peter Bradshaw| website=The Guardian| access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> [[Judi Dench]] and [[Jim Broadbent]] portray Murdoch and Bayley during the later stages of their marriage, while [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Hugh Bonneville]] appear as the couple in their younger years. The film contrasts the start of their relationship, when Murdoch was an outgoing, dominant individual compared to the timid and scholarly Bayley, and their later life, when Murdoch was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and tended to by a frustrated Bayley in their North Oxford home in Charlbury Road. The beach scenes were filmed at Southwold in Suffolk, one of Murdoch's favourite haunts.\n\nThe film had its world premiere in [[Los Angeles]] on 14 December 2001, followed by a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2002 and in the United States on 29 March. It grossed $16 million on a $5.5 million budget and received positive reviews, with praise towards the performances. For his role as Bayley, Broadbent won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]], with Dench ([[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]) and Winslet for ([[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]) also receiving nominations.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the young Iris Murdoch meets fellow student John Bayley at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], he is a naive virgin easily flummoxed by her libertine spirit, arch personality, and obvious artistic talent. Decades later, little has changed and the couple keeps house, with John doting on his more famous wife. When Iris begins experiencing forgetfulness and dementia, however, the devoted John struggles with hopelessness and frustration,<ref name=\"Bayley\"/> and becomes her caretaker, as his wife's mind deteriorates from the ravages of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/iris|title=Iris|website=TimeOut|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Iris Murdoch]]<ref name=\"Bayley\"/>\n** [[Kate Winslet]] as young Iris<ref name=\"Bayley\"/>\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]]<ref name=\"Bayley\"/>\n** [[Hugh Bonneville]] as young John<ref name=\"Bayley\"/>\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Janet Stone\n** [[Juliet Aubrey]] as young Janet\n* [[Timothy West]] as Maurice\n** [[Samuel West]] as young Maurice\n* [[Siobhan Hayes]] as Checkout girl\n* [[Kris Marshall]] as Dr Gudgeon\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 270\n| image1 = JudiDenchFeb07 (cropped).jpg\n| width1 = 1446\n| height1 = 1962\n| image2 = KateWinsletByAndreaRaffin2011.jpg\n| width2 = 529\n| height2 = 669\n| footer = [[Judi Dench]] and [[Kate Winslet]]'s performances garnered critical acclaim and earned them [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively.\n| align = \n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 79% of 110 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
