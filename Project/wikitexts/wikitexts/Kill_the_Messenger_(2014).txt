It is based on the [[Kill the Messenger (Schou book)|book of the same name]] by Nick Schou and the book ''[[Dark Alliance (book)|Dark Alliance]]'' by [[Gary Webb]]. The film stars [[Jeremy Renner]], who also produced the film. The film was released on October 10, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\"/> and depicts a reporter's suppressed attempts to cover the [[CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking|CIA involvement]] and secret support of large scale cocaine sales to fund the Nicaraguan Contras.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1996, ''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' reporter [[Gary Webb]] interviews drug dealer Ronny Quail, who is outraged that the government used [[civil asset forfeiture]] to keep his house even after he was acquitted. Webb's ensuing article about the abuses of forfeiture garners repeated phone calls from a woman named Coral, whom he agrees to meet when she says she has documents that prove the government sponsored [[cocaine]] sales in the U.S. Coral gives Webb a transcript of grand jury testimony (normally kept secret) which was accidentally released to her boyfriend, an accused drug dealer, during [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. After Webb reveals to the prosecutor in the case that he has the transcript, the government drops the charges against Coral's boyfriend in order to protect their main witness: [[Oscar Danilo Bland\u00f3n]].\n\nAfter Webb researches Bland\u00f3n and comes across the pending case of [[\"Freeway\" Rick Ross]], he is stunned to learn that Bland\u00f3n is a paid informant. Armed with this knowledge, Ross' attorney elicits from Bland\u00f3n his sworn testimony outlining the [[CIA]]'s alleged involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking\u2014that the CIA actively supported Bland\u00f3n and his partners\u2019 smuggling of cocaine into the U.S. and used the profits to benefit the Nicaraguan [[Contras]].\n\nWebb travels to a prison in [[Managua]] and speaks to Bland\u00f3n's partner, Norwin Meneses, who confirms [[Oliver North]]'s involvement in the basic \"drugs for guns\" scheme to use profits from cocaine trafficking to fund the Contras. In Washington, D.C., Webb tracks down Fred Weil, a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] employee who was an investigator on the [[Kerry Committee report]], which touched on the same issues. Like many other people that Webb speaks to, Weil warns him that the subject may put him in danger. For good measure, federal agents summon Webb to a meeting where they warn him against publishing what he has learned.\n\nThe paper publishes Webb's story as a three-part series with the title \"[[Dark Alliance series|Dark Alliance]]\"; it is an immediate sensation. Humiliated by being scooped by a regional paper, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' ''[[Washington Post]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]'' all dig into Webb's reporting. Webb views their follow-up reporting as being far too deferential to the CIA. Eventually, their reporting turns to Webb himself, including an affair he had while working at ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''.\n\nWebb is banished to the newspaper's [[Cupertino]] bureau to cover mundane local news. However, he continues to work on the story. He is awoken in his motel room one night by John Cullen, who is precisely the kind of CIA source with direct knowledge of the scheme that Webb's reporting needs. Webb's exhilaration at finding Cullen is quickly dampened when the paper reveals its plans to write an open letter calling into question aspects of its \"Dark Alliance\" reporting. At a [[Society of Professional Journalists]] dinner honoring Webb as the [[Bay Area]] \"Journalist of the Year\", he submits his resignation to his editors. An epilogue reveals that in 2004 [[Gary Webb]] was found dead in his apartment, shot twice in the head. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Gary Webb]]\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Susan Webb\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as John Cullen\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Alan Fenster\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Russell Dodson\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Anna Simons\n* [[Paz Vega]] as Coral Baca\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as [[Jerome Ceppos]]\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Fred Weil\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as [[Walter Pincus]]\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Norwin Meneses\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Ronny Quail\n* [[Michael K.
