It stars [[Guy Pearce]], [[Ray Winstone]], [[Emily Watson]], [[John Hurt]], [[Danny Huston]] and [[David Wenham]]. The film's production completed in 2004 and was followed by a wide 2005 release in [[Australia]] and a 2006 theatrical run in the U.S. through [[First Look Pictures]]. The film was shot on location in [[Winton, Queensland]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1880s [[Australia]],  Charlie Burns ([[Guy Pearce]]) and his gang engage in a gunfight with the police. All of the gang members except for Charlie and his younger brother Mikey are killed. Captain Morris Stanley ([[Ray Winstone]]) tells Charlie that he will have Mikey executed by Christmas, which is in 9 days. Stanley offers to free both Mikey and Charlie if Charlie agrees to kill his older brother Arthur Burns ([[Danny Huston]]), a mercurial psychopath and infamous mass-murdering outlaw who is wanted for serial rapes and murder. Mikey remains in custody while Charlie sets out to kill their brother. During a raid, the police capture some Aboriginal people who, when questioned, claim that Arthur is actually a \"dog man\" and no one goes near his cave.\n\nRiding in search of Arthur, Charlie comes to the charred remains of the Hopkins home, a family that was murdered and the wife raped by the Burns gang. Along the way, he encounters an inebriated old man named Jellon Lamb ([[John Hurt]]) in a cantina where the owner has been speared to death. Charlie realizes that Lamb is a [[bounty hunter]] in pursuit of the Burns brothers and knocks him out. Later on, Charlie awakes and is speared in the chest by a group of Aboriginal men standing over him. Just before passing out, he witnesses the man who speared him get his head blown off by an unseen assailant.\n\nIn town, Eden Fletcher ([[David Wenham]]), who hired Stanley to \"clean up\" the area, orders that Mikey be given one hundred [[Flagellation|lashes]] as punishment for the rape and murder of the Hopkins family. Stanley is aghast at this, not only because he believes Mikey is not responsible for his actions and the flogging will kill him, but also because it will break his deal with Charlie and bring the Burns gang's revenge upon him and his wife. Stanley sends Sergeant Lawrence away with tracker Jacko ([[David Gulpilil]]) and other men to \"investigate\" the reported slaying of Dan O'Riley (the dead man in the cantina) by a group of Aboriginal people.\n\nCharlie wakes up in his brother Arthur's camp, located in caves among desolate mountains. Arthur's gang consists of Samuel Stoat ([[Tom Budge]]), a woman named Queenie ([[Leah Purcell]]) who tends to Charlie's wound, and an Aboriginal man called Two-Bob ([[Tom E. Lewis]]). Arthur apparently will sit alone for long periods of time in a catatonic, alienated, psychopathic state; appearing psychologically dead or dormant. As he recovers from his wounds, Arthur slowly is activated and Charlie is given several opportunities to kill his brother, but does not. He lies and tells Arthur that Mikey is not with him because he has met a woman.\n\nCaptain Stanley attempts to defend Mikey at gunpoint from the bloodthirsty townspeople, but is overruled once Martha arrives, insisting on revenge for her dead friends. Mikey is flogged and fatally wounded. The townspeople grow tired and eventually disturbed at the excessive display, Martha faints, and Stanley flings the bloody whip at Fletcher, who fires him. Back at the abandoned cantina, Sergeant Lawrence and his men have found and massacred a group of Aboriginal people. Arthur and Two-Bob find Lawrence's group while they sleep. Arthur\u2019s psychopathy is now fully triggered, revealing himself to be a cunning murderer, and he kills Jacko. Before Arthur kills Lawrence, he tells Arthur that Charlie has been sent to kill him. Arthur doesn\u2019t care and proceeds to stomp Lawrence to death with his boot.\n\nJellon Lamb enters Arthur's camp and ties up Samuel and Charlie, both of whom are sleeping. Lamb is shot in the stomach by the returning Two-Bob. Arthur begins to sadistically torture Lamb to death with his knife slowly while Lamb is still alive; in disgust Charlie points his revolver at Arthur, but instead shoots Lamb in the head, putting him out of his misery. In a confession to Charlie, Arthur acknowledges his disturbed nature and addiction to murder as a sickness, sensing his brother\u2019s disapproval and asking for mercy and sympathy. Charlie finally informs Arthur that Mikey is in custody and is set to hang. Charlie decides to break out Mikey; Arthur, Samuel and Charlie ride into town dressed in the clothes taken from the officers Arthur and Two-Bob had killed, while Two-Bob poses as an Aboriginal man they have captured. Once at the jail, the men free Mikey, and Charlie and Two-Bob ride off with him, but the badly injured Mikey dies in Charlie's arms. Arthur and Samuel remain to behead the two officers in the jail.\n\nStanley fears retribution and makes preparations, but he and Martha let their guard down to have a peaceful Christmas dinner. Once they begin, Arthur and Samuel shoot open the door and invade their home. Arthur pulls Stanley into another room and brutally beats him. Samuel drags Martha inside, and Arthur has Stanley watch as Samuel begins to rape Martha. Charlie walks in and informs Arthur of Mikey's death; Arthur ignores him and encourages Charlie to listen to Samuel's beautiful singing. Charlie shoots Samuel in the head, killing him, and then shoots Arthur once in the stomach and then again, fatally in the heart. Arthur staggers out of the house and Charlie follows to find him seated on the ground, dying. In a moment of forgiveness and gesture of brotherly love, Charlie sits next to Arthur to watch the sunset. Arthur asks Charlie what he will do next, and dies after his question is answered with stoic silence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Guy Pearce]] as Charlie Burns\n*[[Ray Winstone]] as Captain Morris Stanley\n*[[Emily Watson]] as Martha Stanley\n*[[Danny Huston]] as Arthur Burns\n*[[David Wenham]] as Eden Fletcher\n*[[Richard Wilson (Australian actor)|Richard Wilson]] as Mike Burns\n*[[John Hurt]] as Jellon Lamb\n*[[Tom E.

The music was composed and performed by [[Nick Cave]] and violinist [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]].\n\nAll tracks are directly reproduced from the musical interludes in the film, and feature little alteration from the film score. Many songs on the album are slow-tempo and ballad-like, and the violin work of Warren Ellis becomes the central voice of the album for much of the time. The album is instrumentally focused, and is a departure from Cave's band-oriented compositions. Cave's unusual vocal performances on the \"Rider\" trilogy of songs brings a particularly haunting and uneasy tone to the album.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Proposition'' received a [[Limited release]] in North America opening in 3 theatres and grossed $32,681, with an average of $10,893 per theatre and ranking #46 at the box office.

And [[Danny Huston]] is oddly perfect as Arthur. It\u2019s a strange, unsettling film, ultimately quite moving, it\u2019s impossible not to respond to it strongly. It\u2019s not an easy access film.

So, it has a lot of originality there. And it has fine performances. I thought Danny Huston was extraordinary, actually. He's an actor I usually don't respond to, but I thought he was excellent in this role. So, there's a lot of intriguing elements to this film, but I did find the violence almost unwatchable.\"<ref>D.

In an interview included on the DVD, Lewis even compares the depiction of indigenous cultures in ''The Proposition'' to the landmark film ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' (1978), which Lewis starred in.\n\n==Home media==\nThe DVD was released in the United States by First Look Pictures on 19 September 2006.\n\nTartan Video's [[DVD region code|Region 2 DVD]] release in the UK was a two-disc release and contains these additional features: audio commentary by Nick Cave and John Hillcoat on disc 1, exclusive interviews with Guy Pearce and Danny Huston (25 minutes), a \"meet the cast and crew\" feature (35 minutes), a \"making of\" feature (118 minutes) and a theatrical trailer on disc 2.\n\nThe film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on 19 August 2008.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Australian films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0421238|title=The Proposition}}\n* {{Mojo title|proposition06}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|proposition|title=The Proposition}}\n* {{Amg movie|317309|The Proposition}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051207014238/http://www.infilm.com.au/reviews/theproposition.htm InFilm Australia review]\n*[http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A676125;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 The Proposition at the National Film and Sound Archive]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326060744/http://url.edna.edu.au/4bbN Full Cast Credits at IMDb]\n{{AACTAAward BestMusicScore 2000-2019}}\n{{John Hillcoat}}\n{{Nick Cave}}\n{{Bushrangers |state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Proposition, The}}\n[[Category:2005 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:Bushranger films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Hillcoat]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nick Cave]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Warren Ellis (musician)]]\n[[Category:Films set in colonial Australia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1880s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Nick Cave]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
