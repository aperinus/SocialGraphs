Filmed from 2002 to 2013, ''Boyhood'' depicts the childhood and adolescence of Mason Evans Jr. (Coltrane) from ages six to eighteen as he grows up in [[Texas]] with divorced parents (Arquette and Hawke). Richard Linklater's daughter Lorelei plays Mason's sister, Samantha.\n\nProduction began in 2002 and finished in 2013, with Linklater's goal to make a film about growing up. The project began without a completed script, with only basic plot points and the ending written initially. Linklater developed the script throughout production, writing the next year's portion of the film after rewatching the previous year's footage. He incorporated changes he saw in each actor into the script, while also allowing all major actors to participate in the writing process by incorporating their life experiences into their characters' stories.\n\n''Boyhood'' premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref name=\"sund\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/richard-linklaters-ambitious-boyhood-premieres-at-sundance |title=Richard Linklater's Ambitious 'Boyhood' Premieres at Sundance |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=April 27, 2014 |archive-date=May 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520133238/http://www.slashfilm.com/richard-linklaters-ambitious-boyhood-premieres-at-sundance/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and was released theatrically on July 11, 2014.<ref name=\"neumyer1\">{{cite news |url=http://www.parade.com/220002/scottneumyer/richard-linklater-talks-before-midnight-boyhood-and-a-possible-tv-series/ |title=Richard Linklater Talks Before Midnight, Boyhood, and a Possible TV Series |work=Parade |first=Scott |last=Neumyer |date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=November 3, 2013 |archive-date=November 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103215646/http://www.parade.com/220002/scottneumyer/richard-linklater-talks-before-midnight-boyhood-and-a-possible-tv-series/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The film competed in the main competition section of the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Berlin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_21396.html |title=Berlinale 2014: Competition Complete |access-date=January 15, 2014 |work=berlinale |archive-date=January 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118075918/http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_21396.html |url-status=live }}</ref> where Linklater won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/auszeichnungen__/pue-presse-detail_22936.html |title=The Awards Of The 64th Berlin International Film Festival |access-date=January 15, 2014 |work=berlinale |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223000217/http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/auszeichnungen__/pue-presse-detail_22936.html# |archive-date=February 23, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> It received universal acclaim from critics, with praise for its performances, Linklater's screenplay and direction, and subject matter.

Furthermore, the plot summary should be set between 400-700 words per WP:FILMPLOT. -->\n\nIn 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans Jr. and his older sister Samantha live with their divorced mother, Olivia, in a small town in [[Texas]]. Mason overhears Olivia arguing with her boyfriend, saying she has no free time due to parenting. In 2003, Olivia moves the family to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] so she can attend the [[University of Houston]] and get a better job. In 2004, Mason's father, Mason Sr., visits Houston and takes Mason and Samantha bowling. When he drops the children off at home, he argues with Olivia while Mason and Samantha watch from a window. Olivia takes Mason to one of her classes, introducing him to her professor, Bill Welbrock; Mason sees them flirt.\n\nIn 2005, Olivia and Bill have married and blended their two families. They share experiences such as playing video games and attending a midnight release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. Mason and Samantha are enrolled in the same school as their step-siblings, where Mason befriends Nicole, who has a crush on him. In 2006, Mason and Samantha bond with Mason Sr. as he takes them out for a day in Houston, culminating in a [[Houston Astros]] game and a sleepover at his house. Olivia continues her education and is initially supportive of Bill's strict parenting style, which includes many chores for the children and an enforced cutting of Mason's long hair. In 2007, Bill gradually becomes abusive and violent as alcoholism takes over his life. After Bill assaults Olivia and endangers the children, Olivia moves her children to a friend's house and files for divorce while her step children stay with their abusive father and face an uncertain future. \n\nIn 2008, Mason Sr. learns that Samantha has a boyfriend and talks to her and Mason about contraception. Mason Sr. and Mason go camping and connect through music, film, and Mason's blossoming interest in girls. Mason and Samantha have grown into their lives in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], a town close to Austin. In 2009, Mason is bullied at school and playfully teased on a camping trip but starts receiving attention from girls. Olivia takes a job in teaching psychology at college and moves in with Jim, a student and [[Iraq War]] veteran.\n\nIn 2010, Mason has started high school and experimented with [[marijuana]] and [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. Mason Sr., who has remarried and has a baby, takes Mason and Samantha to visit his wife's parents. For his birthday, Mason Sr. gives Mason a suit and CDs; Mason's step-grandparents give him a Bible and a shotgun. In 2011, Mason is lectured by his photography teacher, who sees his potential but is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Mason attends a party and meets Sheena, who becomes his girlfriend. After Mason arrives home late one night from a party, a drunk Jim confronts Mason about his late hours. Olivia and Jim subsequently break up, and the family's financial situation worsens.\n\nIn 2012, Mason and Sheena visit Samantha, who is attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where they share their hopes and fears about college. Samantha's roommate discovers them asleep together in her dormitory. In May 2013, during the end of Mason's senior year in high school, he has a painful breakup with Sheena, wins the second place silver medal in a state photography contest, and is awarded college scholarship money. Mason's family throws him a graduation party and toasts his success. Mason Sr. gives him advice about his breakup. Planning to sell the house and downsize, Olivia meets Samantha and Mason for lunch and asks them to sort through their possessions. Later that year, as Mason prepares to leave for college, Olivia breaks down, disillusioned by how quickly life has passed. At [[Sul Ross State University]] in [[Alpine, Texas|Alpine]], Mason moves into his dorm and meets his new roommate Dalton, Dalton's girlfriend Barb, and Barb's roommate, Nicole. Mason takes drugs given to him by Barb and the group goes hiking at [[Big Bend Ranch State Park]]. Nicole shares with Mason her belief that, rather than people seizing moments, moments seize people; Mason agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Ellar Coltrane]] as Mason Evans Jr.\n*[[Patricia Arquette]] as Olivia\n*[[Ethan Hawke]] as Mason Evans Sr.\n*[[Lorelei Linklater]] as Samantha Evans\n*[[Libby Villari]] as Catherine\n*[[Marco Perella]] as Bill Welbrock\n*[[Brad Hawkins (actor)|Brad Hawkins]] as Jim\n*Jamie Howard as Mindy Welbrock\n*Andrew Villarreal as Randy Welbrock\n*Jenni Tooley as Annie\n*Richard Andrew Jones as Annie's father\n*Karen Jones as Annie's mother\n*[[Bill Wise]] as Steve Evans\n*Zoe Graham as Sheena\n*[[Charlie Sexton]] as Jimmy\n*Barbara Chisholm as Carol\n*Cassidy Johnson as Abby\n*Richard Robichaux as Mason's boss\n*Steven Chester Prince as Ted\n*[[Tom McTigue]] as Mr. Turlington\n*Will Harris as Sam's boyfriend at college\n*Andrea Chen as Sam's college roommate\n*Maximillian McNamara as Dalton\n*Taylor Weaver as Barb, Dalton's girlfriend\n*Jessi Mechler as Nicole\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn May 2002, Linklater said that he would begin shooting an untitled film in his home city of [[Houston]] that summer.<ref name=\"twelve\">Blackburn, Rachel.

All major actors participated in the writing process, contributing their life experiences; for example, Hawke's character is based on his and Linklater's fathers\u2014both Texan insurance agents who divorced and remarried\u2014and Arquette's character is based on her mother, who resumed her education later in life and became a psychotherapist.{{r|stern20140710}}\n\nDespite the unconventional screenwriting process, Linklater stated that he had a general storyline in mind, and that the actors did not change the general direction of the story:\n\n<blockquote>People think I asked Ellar, \"What did you do in school the other day? Let's make a scene about that!\" That never happened. The time we spent together was me just gauging where he was at in his life\u2014what his concerns were and what he was doing.
