In 1990, the film was shot in the [[United States]], [[Turkey]] and [[Israel]], and the main characters Betty Mahmoody and [[Sayyed Bozorg Mahmoody|Sayyed Bozorg \"Moody\" Mahmoody]] are played by [[Sally Field]] and [[Alfred Molina]], respectively. Sheila Rosenthal and [[Roshan Seth]] star as [[Mahtob Mahmoody]] and Houssein the smuggler, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1984, an Iranian physician, Sayyed Bozorg \"Moody\" Mahmoody lives in the [[United States]] with his American wife Betty and their daughter Mahtob. Due to his background, he is often mocked and ridiculed by American physicians at the hospital where he works. Moody claims that his Iranian family wants to meet Betty and Mahtob, and asks them to come with him for a two-week visit.\n\nDespite her deep fears about visiting Iran, particularly due to the [[Iranian Hostage Crisis]] of several years earlier, Betty reluctantly agrees after her husband promises they will safely return to America. Upon their arrival, Mahtob is embraced, while Betty's unfamiliarity with Iranian culture inadvertently offends some members of Moody's family. The night before their flight back to the United States, Moody's brother Mammal tells Moody and Betty that in order for them to go back home, their passports would have to have been taken to the airport for approval three days prior. Betty questions this, but Moody brushes this off, suggesting that they will take a later flight.\n\nAfter Betty insists that they go to the airport anyway, Moody reveals that he never intended for them to return, and that they will remain in Iran permanently. When Betty protests, Moody becomes enraged and strikes her. Betty tries to earn sympathy from Moody's family, but is scorned by them. Iran's [[Iran-Iraq War|war with Iraq]] continues, with the family having to shelter in place during an Iraqi missile attack; Moody blames these difficulties on American [[Iraq-United States relations|support for Iraq]].\n\nMoody becomes more hostile and abusive to his wife and daughter, preventing Betty from leaving the house or even using the telephone. One day Betty answers a phone call from her mother and reveals she is trapped in Iran. Her mother tells her to seek help from the [[Protecting power|American Interests Section]] of the [[Iran-Switzerland relations|Swiss Embassy]]. Betty sneaks out of the house and visits the embassy, but is told that under Iran's [[Iranian nationality law|nationality law]], she acquired Iranian citizenship upon her marriage to Moody and thus is not entitled to consular protection. Because Iran is an [[Islamic republic]] governed by [[sharia law]], Betty cannot leave the country or make decisions concerning her daughter without her husband's permission. Moody, alarmed by Betty's absence from the house, threatens to kill her if she tries anything again.\n\nFor 18 months Betty conforms to her husband's wishes in order to gain Moody's trust. Watched by Moody's sister, Betty convinces him that they should move out of her home and into Mammal's home. By chance, during a trip to the marketplace, she meets a sympathetic storekeeper who allows her to use his telephone and overhears her conversations with the Swiss Embassy. He puts her in contact with a pair of humanitarian Iranians, Hossein and his sister, who offer to help Betty and Mahtob return to the United States. Betty accepts Hossein's assistance, especially after he warns her that Mahtob, when she reaches nine years old, could be at risk of being [[Child marriage|forced into marriage]] and or be [[Conscription|drafted]] as a [[child soldier]]. Mahtob does not adjust to her new Iranian school and has to be accompanied to school by Betty. The women at the school tell Betty that they sympathize with her, and though they will not allow her to use the telephone, they allow her to bring Mahtob to school hours after she would normally arrive. Betty uses this time to meet with Hossein, and they discuss an escape route. When she and Mahtob arrive at school, Moody is there waiting for them and attacks Betty. She leaves with Moody, but flees when he is distracted. She finds a telephone booth and calls a woman from the Swiss embassy whom she had spoken with previously. They return to the school, but the women from the school forbid her from taking Mahtob. With no other options, Betty and Mahtob return home with Moody.\n\nBetty learns that her father is seriously ill. Moody tells Betty he will allow her to return to see her dying father, but will not let Mahtob go with her. He tells Betty while she is in the United States, she is to liquidate their assets and return to Iran. Hossein warns Betty that if she visits her father, she may never see Mahtob again. Betty decides to wait to return to the United States with Mahtob. Moody unknowingly foils her plans by having her booked on a flight several days early, thanks to his relatives' contacts in the airport.\n\nMoody is called to the clinic for an emergency. On the pretense of going to buy presents for her father, Betty takes Mahtob and they contact Hossein, who supplies Betty and Mahtob with fake identity documents, and they make their way past checkpoint with Iranian smugglers.\n\nBetty and Mahtob are dropped off in a street in [[Ankara]], where they see the flag of the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] in the distance. Betty and Mahtob make it back home to the United States. Betty becomes a successful author and dedicates herself to helping those in need.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sally Field]] as Betty Mahmoody\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Sayyed Bozorg \"Moody\" Mahmoody\n* Sheila Rosenthal as Mahtob Mahmoody\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as Houssein the Smuggler\n* [[Sarah Badel]] as Nicole (Swiss diplomat)\n* Mony Rey as Ameh Bozorg\n* [[Georges Corraface]] as Mohsen\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was based on a book with the [[Not Without My Daughter (book)|same title]], written by Betty Mahmoody and William Hoffer and based on Betty's version of events.

If a movie of such a vitriolic and spiteful nature were to be made in America about any other ethnic group, it would be denounced as racist and prejudiced. Yet I recommend that the film be seen, for two reasons. One reason is because of the undeniable dramatic strength of its structure and performances; it is impossible not to identify with this mother and her daughter, and Field is very effective as a brave, resourceful woman who is determined to free herself and her daughter from involuntary captivity. The second reason is harder to explain. I think the movie should be seen because it is an invitation to thought.\"<ref name=\"EbertRev\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/not-without-my-daughter-1991 |title=Not Without My Daughter (review) |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |work=RogerEbert.com |date=January 11, 1991 |access-date=2014-07-08}}</ref>\n\nWhile Iranians are not shown in a completely negative light, as the film depicts generous and brave Iranians who contact Betty Mahmoody and arrange for the escape of her and her daughter, these \"good\" Iranians are high-born opponents of the Islamic Republic regime, shown listening to European classical music.<ref>Yale, Pat, Anthony Ham, and Paul Greenway.
