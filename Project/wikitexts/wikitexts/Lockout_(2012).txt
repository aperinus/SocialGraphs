It is both Mather and Saint Leger's feature directorial debuts. The film stars [[Guy Pearce]], [[Maggie Grace]], [[Vincent Regan]], [[Joe Gilgun]], [[Lennie James]] and [[Peter Stormare]]. The plot follows Snow (Pearce), a man framed for a crime he did not commit, who is offered his freedom in exchange for rescuing the President's daughter Emilie (Grace) from the orbital prison ''MS One'', which has been taken over by its inmates, led by Alex (Regan) and his psychotic brother Hydell (Gilgun).\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Belgrade|Belgrade, Serbia]]. It premiered on 7 April 2012 at the [[Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film]], and was released on 13 April 2012 in North America and on 18 April 2012 in France.\n\nA French court has ruled the film plagiarises the plot of the [[Cult film|cult classic]] ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''.<ref name=\"yahoo.com\">{{cite news|title=French filmmaker Besson guilty of plagiarising action classic|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/french-filmmaker-besson-guilty-plagiarising-action-classic-141823009.html|access-date=29 July 2016|work=AFP|date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2079, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative Snow is arrested for [[murder]]ing Colonel Frank Armstrong, who had uncovered evidence of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] selling secrets about the United States space program. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and [[espionage]]. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary ''MS One'', where prisoners are kept in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] for the length of their sentences. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden.\n\nMeanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on ''MS One'' to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop [[mental instability]]. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a [[siege]]. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on ''MS One'' and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but Hydell disagrees and Snow is forced to infiltrate ''MS One''. Alex realizes that Emilie is the President's daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the [[oxygen]] supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by [[suicide]] in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time.\n\nSnow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie after administering first aid for her wounds. Snow then changes Emilie's hair & clothing to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed. They find Mace, but the stasis has given him [[dementia]] and made him incoherent. Snow and Emilie bring Mace with them and attempt to reach the [[escape pod]]. With no one at the helm, the prison falls out of orbit and crashes into the [[International Space Station]]. The collision causes a hull breach, killing Mace. Snow brings Emilie to the escape pod, but discovers it has only one seat. Realizing that he has been sent there to die, he sends Emilie on her way, but she allows the pod to launch without her because she believes the remaining hostages will be killed. Hydell contacts Emilie and threatens the hostages unless she reveals her location; after she does, however, he kills them anyway.\n\nSnow and Emilie discover evidence that the prisoners were being illegally used as test subjects. Alex finds and captures Emilie; he also shoots Snow, leaving him for dead. Alex learns that Hydell has killed all of the hostages; he contacts the President, threatening to let Hydell and the prisoners [[rape]] Emilie if they are not released. The President refuses to allow a siege and risk Emilie, causing Langral to temporarily relieve him of his command. Langral orders the destruction of ''MS One''. Hydell tries to rape Emilie as promised, but is stopped by Alex. Hydell and Alex fight, resulting in Alex's death. Hydell then tries to stab Emilie, but Snow arrives and knocks him out. Snow and Emilie flee from Hydell and the remaining prisoners. Meanwhile, Langral's men plant a bomb on the prison. Snow and Emilie use space suits and jump from ''MS One'' as it detonates. Using their suits, Snow and Emilie re-enter Earth's atmosphere and land safely in [[New York City]], where Snow is arrested.\n\nEmilie later realizes that Mace's incoherent rambling was actually a code revealing the location of Frank's briefcase. Examining the motel room where Frank was killed, Emilie realizes that Langral saw what he believed was Snow shooting Frank on a mirrored door which only showed part of what happened when in reality Snow was shooting at the actual assassin at the same time that Frank was shot. Snow gives the briefcase to Shaw, who unlocks it but is shocked to find it empty. Snow notes that he had not given Shaw the combination, and Shaw is revealed to be the mole and arrested. However, he believes that he will get off lightly as people like him are needed. Snow is released and his possessions returned, including a lighter given to him by Frank before his death. Examining the lighter, Snow finds a [[memory card]] containing the real secret information hidden inside. Emilie meets Snow and teases him after discovering his first name is Marion; the pair walk away together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Marion Snow:\n:A former government agent wrongly convicted of espionage against the United States.<ref name=\"Cast1\"/> After meeting with him for the first time, the directors commented that he was too skinny, but Pearce promised that he would \"buff up.\" Pearce undertook a [[high-protein diet]] and weightlifting regimen to increase his muscle mass, as he believed it was important that Snow look like a serious action hero.<ref name=\"Cast3\"/>\n* [[Maggie Grace]] as Emilie Warnock:\n:The daughter of the [[President of the United States]].<ref name=\"Cast1\"/> Grace intended to perform as many of her own stunts as possible, and was required to learn stunt, combat, and wire work before filming began.<ref name=\"Filming2\"/><ref name=\"Cast2\"/> She was drawn to the role partly because of Besson, with whom she had worked twice previously, and because she saw the character as a \"kick-ass\" woman. Describing Emilie, Grace said she is a \"capable young woman who knows how to negotiate her role as someone in a position of responsibility. She certainly has a strong world compass and she responds amazingly well under pressure. True, she's not exactly trained for the situation she finds herself in, but that's OK. There's still a strength about her in spite of that.\"<ref name=\"Filming2\"/>\n* [[Joe Gilgun]] as Hydell:\n:Alex's psychotic brother and fellow prisoner.<ref name=\"Cast5\"/>\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as Alex:\n:A prisoner and leader of the prison revolt.<ref name=\"Cast5\"/>\n* [[Lennie James]] as Harry Shaw:\n:A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer.<ref name=\"Cast5\"/>\n*[[Peter Stormare]] as Scott Langral:\n:The Chief of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. Describing what drew him to the role, Stormare commented \"the part was nice because it was like 'Wow, he's eluding me all the time. What is he up to? Is he really a bad guy or a good guy? What side is he on?' You never find out, which is kind of cool.\"<ref name=\"Cast4\"/>\n\nThe cast also includes [[Jacky Ido]] as Hock, Emilie's bodyguard; [[Tim Plester]] as Mace, Snow's contact; Mark Tankersley as Barnes, the prison Warden; [[Anne-Solenne Hatte]] as Kathryn, Emilie's aide and friend; Peter Hudson as President Jeff Warnock, Emilie's father; and Miodrag Stevanovic as Frank Armstrong, a CIA agent.\n\n==Development==\n[[Principal photography]] was scheduled to begin on 7 September 2010,<ref name=\"Filming1\"/> in the [[Serbia]]n capital city [[Belgrade]].<ref name=\"Filming2\"/><ref name=\"ColliderFeb11\"/> Much of the filming used [[Chroma key|green screen]]s, rather than practical sets.<ref name=\"Filming2\"/><ref name=\"ColliderFeb11\"/> The intended scenes were [[storyboard]]ed in [[Dublin, Ireland]] to aid the actors in visualizing how the green screen scenes would appear after the completion of the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in post-production. Speaking about the experience, Grace stated: \"You just have to suspend the voice in your head because you feel so silly reacting to nothing there. Having whole conversations with people that aren't there. I felt a little crazy the first time around.\"<ref name=\"Cast2\"/>\n\n[[Luc Besson]] produced the film.
