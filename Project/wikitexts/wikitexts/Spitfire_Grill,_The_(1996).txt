It tells a story of a woman who was just released from prison and goes to work in a small-town caf\u00e9 known as The Spitfire Grill.  \n\nThe film won the Audience Award at the 1996 [[Sundance Film Festival]], prompting several distributors to enter into a bidding war in response to the positive buzz, but when the movie was finally released, critics as a whole responded less favorably than they had at Sundance. The movie is the basis for the 2001 [[Off-Broadway]] [[The Spitfire Grill (musical)|musical of the same name]] by [[James Valcq]] and [[Fred Alley]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story centers on a young woman named Percy Talbott, a recently released prison parolee who arrives in a small town in Maine with hopes of starting a new life. She lands a job as a waitress at the Spitfire Grill, owned by Hannah, whose gruff exterior conceals a kind heart and little tolerance for the grill's regular customers who are suspicious of Percy's mysterious past. None is more suspicious than Nahum, Hannah's nephew; although his wife, Shelby, has a kinder curiosity.\n\nWhen Hannah is bedridden after a nasty fall, Percy and Shelby pitch in to save the Grill and win the approval of Hannah, who learns she does need friends. Joe, an attractive young man in town, becomes smitten with Percy. He is approached by a scientist who thinks that the town's trees might have medicinal benefits. As the plot unfolds, Hannah holds a $100-per-entry essay contest to find a new owner for the grill. This creates a positive change in the town, but the plans are disrupted by Nahum's suspicions about Percy and the revelation that a local hermit is Hannah's shell-shocked, [[Vietnam veteran]] son. Percy sacrifices her own life to save Hannah's son and prompts a number of the town's citizens to examine their own conduct more deeply.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Alison Elliott]] as Percy Talbott\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Hannah Ferguson\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Shelby Goddard\n* [[Will Patton]] as Nahum \"Caleb\" Goddard\n* [[Kieran Mulroney]] as Joe Sperling\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as Sheriff Joe Sutter\n* [[John M.

The film somewhat misleads the audience into thinking that it will be Percy who finds redemption, but it is other characters and relationships, and indeed the town itself, that are powerfully redeemed through Percy's actions.\n\n==Background==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2022}}\nThe idea for the film was conceived by Malcolm Roger Courts, long-time director and CEO of Sacred Heart League, Inc., a Catholic nonprofit fundraising and communications organization based in Walls, Mississippi.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Catholic-Funded 'Spitfire Grill' Finds Success Despite Skepticism |url=https://www.ncregister.com/features/catholic-funded-spitfire-grill-finds-success-despite-skepticism |access-date=2022-08-07 |website=National Catholic Register |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hays |first=Katie |title=Movie Review: The Spitfire Grill (Nov 96 \u2013 Mar 97) |url=https://archives.wineskins.org/article/movie-review-the-spitfire-grill-nov-96-mar-97/ |website=Wineskins magazine}}</ref> In the late 1970s, he wished to make a film\u2014an alternative to the ministry of print that was a hallmark of Sacred Heart League, which published and distributed millions of pieces of literature.\n\nWith the approval and support of the league's board of directors, Courts began searching for a screenplay that could be produced under the direction of Sacred Heart League's film production subsidiary, Gregory Productions, Inc. Courts and his colleagues read more than 200 prospective screenplays and found most of them lacking in Judeo-Christian values and good story-telling. In the early 1990s, Courts was introduced to Warren Stitt, who eventually became the executive producer of \"The Spitfire Grill.\" Stitt knew of the work of Lee David Zlotoff of ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' fame, and an introduction was made. Courts agreed to field screenplay treatments from Zlotoff, and in late 1994, the story of the film was written by Zlotoff.\n\nWith private financing from Sacred Heart League, the film was shot in Peacham, Vermont and Troy, Vermont in 35 days in April\u2013May, 1995. After editing the film, it was submitted to the Sundance Film Festival in the feature film competition, and was accepted for screening at the 1996 festival in Park City, Utah. Before screening at Sundance, Courts engaged composer [[James Horner]] to compose the musical score for the film.\n\nWith the three female stars in attendance at Sundance, Courts and his team enjoyed the support of an enthusiastic crowd during the festival screenings. During one sold-out festival screening, a representative of [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] viewed the film and contacted her superiors in Los Angeles. A second print of the film was sent by courier to the Castle Rock headquarters for screening by its executives, who promptly offered $10 million for the film's rights, the largest sum paid outright for an independent feature film.\n\nOn the heels of being sold to Castle Rock Entertainment, the film won the Audience Award at Sundance. The film was distributed worldwide with only a modest return and lukewarm critical reaction.\n\nProfits from the sale of the film were used to construct a kindergarten through eighth grade school for 450 children in Southaven, Mississippi, located 10 miles from the Sacred Heart League headquarters in Walls.\n\nIn 2001, a [[The Spitfire Grill (musical)|musical adaptation]] of the film with a brighter ending, written by [[Fred Alley]] and [[James Valcq]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Spitfire Grill Musical |url=https://www.spitfiregrillmusical.com/ |website=The Spitfire Grill}}</ref> premiered at [[George Street Playhouse]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey, directed by David Saint and then moved to [[Playwrights Horizons]] Theater in New York.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews. Critics generally were impressed by the film's efforts, but felt that the script was too underdeveloped and too similar to other films. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote \"Watching this plot unfold, I was remembering last week's ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'', which also premiered at Sundance; its cafe was run by an older woman (Shelley Winters), and had a veteran waitress (Deborah Harry) and a young waitress (Liv Tyler), and had a regular customer whose name was Leo, not Joe, although he was played by Joe Grifasi. Also echoing in the caverns of my memory were several other movies about stalwart women running cafes and striding above the local gossip: ''[[The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9 (film)|The Ballad of the Sad Cafe]],'' ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes]],'' [[Staying Together (film)|''Staying Together'']] and of course ''[[Bagdad Caf\u00e9|Bagdad Cafe]].''\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=August 23, 1996 |title=The Spitfire Grill movie review (1996) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-spitfire-grill-1996 |access-date=August 7, 2022 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> Ebert also reviewed the film with [[Gene Siskel]], each giving a thumbs down.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Very Brady Sequel, She\u2019s the One, Kansas City, Girls Town, The Spitfire Grill - August 24, 1996 |url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=792 |access-date= |website=Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews}}</ref> Robert Roten of the ''Laramie Movie Scope'' wrote \"this light character study explodes into a full blown melodrama at the end using a bunch of tired old clich\u00e9s, like misplaced money, your standard hermit in the woods and an almost laughably melodramatic drowning.
