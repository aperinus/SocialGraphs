Their feature film [[directorial debut]], it had its world premiere on September 9, 2013 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], where it won a special jury citation for Best Canadian First Feature Film. Lee and Prowse star as two friends whose goal to film themselves traveling the world is cut short when one of them contracts a mysterious disease.\n\n''Afflicted'' received a theatrical and [[video-on-demand]] release on April 4, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nChildhood friends Clif Prowse and Derek Lee have decided to venture around the world to film their travel [[web series]] ''Ends of the Earth''. The trip is Derek's last wish, as he has an [[Cerebral arteriovenous malformation|AVM]], which could cause his death at any moment.\n\nClif and Derek stop in [[Barcelona]] to meet with old friends currently on tour with their band. After their initially uneventful stay, Derek picks up a woman by the name of Audrey after telling her about his AVM. Later that night, Clif bursts into Derek's hotel room as a prank, only to discover Derek bleeding and semiconscious, and no sign of Audrey. Though Derek doesn't remember anything about the attack, they assume that Audrey planned to rob him.\n\nUpon getting to Italy, Derek passes out and sleeps for an entire day. Clif awakens him the next afternoon for lunch. At the restaurant, Derek hungrily devours his pasta dish and then suddenly projectile vomits. Later, at a vineyard, Derek has an extreme reaction to sunlight, and is forced to flee inside, covered in burns. Back at the hotel room, Clif attempts to calm Derek down, only for Derek to explosively punch clean through the corner of a stone wall with his bare hands.\n\nOver the next few days, Derek displays superhuman strength, speed and agility. Clif attempts to persuade Derek to stop their trip and go home, but Derek continues to insist that there is nothing wrong with him. As Derek grows sicker due to not being able to eat, he finally agrees to go to a hospital. On the way, the two are almost hit by a car. Derek fights with the angry driver and passenger, completely overpowering them both. Then he licks their blood off his hand.\n\nClif correctly deduces that Derek has contracted [[vampire|vampirism]], but researching it online proves unhelpful. Derek first tries drinking blood obtained from a butcher, and then kills and drinks the blood from someone's pet piglet, only to vomit out the blood on both occasions. Realizing that Derek needs human blood, he and Clif attempt to rob an ambulance, which proves unsuccessful, and they retreat back to the hotel. Derek enters a catatonic state, and Clif decides to cut his own arm to give Derek some human blood, but discovers that Derek has escaped. Clif attempts to find him, only to be ambushed and killed by the completely inhuman Derek. Upon regaining his senses and realizing that he has killed his friend, Derek shoots himself in the head with a shotgun. Shortly after, however, Derek's head heals with only slight scarring, and he is faced with the fact that he cannot die or be killed.\n\nSoon after, [[Interpol]] agents attempt to take Derek into custody, forcing him to escape in daylight, carrying only Clif's camera bag. He manages to get back to France and hides in an abandoned warehouse in Paris. Reviewing the footage of his meeting with Audrey, he realizes that her cell phone might be at the hotel where she bit him. After retrieving the cell phone, Derek texts every one of the numbers on the contact list in order to try and lure someone to him. Eventually, he gets a reply from an unknown man offering to meet in person; Derek hides and tails him back to a squalid building. In the man's apartment, he finds a bloodstained saw and photographs, one of them showing an old black and white photograph of Audrey. Suddenly the man ambushes Derek from behind, but his superior strength enables him to overpower and restrain his attacker.  The man is revealed to be Maurice, an acquaintance of Audrey's who is bitter that Audrey turned Derek into a vampire but left him human. Derek sets up a live-stream camera showing Maurice tied up, in order to draw Audrey in. Maurice nevertheless warns Derek to leave before Audrey arrives and kills him. Suddenly, however, the apartment is stormed by the [[GIGN]] and Derek is shot to near-death before entering a frenzy state. After slaughtering the whole squad, Derek escapes once again.\n\nAudrey finally comes to Derek in the abandoned building, where she attacks him and tells him not to approach her or Maurice ever again, before suddenly relinquishing this approach, telling Derek that he is not feeding properly. She tells the distraught Derek that there is no cure for his condition, adding that she would have cured herself if there were one, to which Derek responds by furiously lashing out at her. The two fight, but Derek is easily overpowered by the more experienced Audrey. Audrey urges him to feed every four to five days, lest he become inhuman again and turns into \"something much worse\", and starts to kill indiscriminately and daily. Audrey tells him that he cannot choose not to kill, but he can choose whom to kill, and explains that she chose Derek because she knew he was dying and thought she was being kind.\n\nLater, Derek posts his final entry online, in which he explains that he can never contact his family again. He thereafter is shown filming himself feeding on a man who had videos on his cell phone of a sexual assault on a child.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, somewhere in Italy, a teenage boy and two teenage girls are seen sneaking into a swimming pool, only to be attacked. The boy gets away, and with his camera running, finds the bloodied corpse of one of the girls, before Clif, now also a vampire, appears and attacks him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*Derek Lee as Derek\n*Clif Prowse as Clif\n*Michael Gill as Michael Gill\n*Jason Lee as Jason\n*Gary Redekop as Gary\n*Lily Py Lee as Derek's Mom\n*Zach Gray as Zachary\n*Edo Van Breemen as Edo\n*Benjamin Zeitoun as Maurice\n*Baya Rehaz as Audrey\n*Ian Hanlin as Jeff}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in Barcelona, Paris, Italy, and Vancouver<ref name=\"STYD interview\">{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive Interview: How Lee & Prowse Pulled Off the Ambitious Afflicted|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/351145-exclusive-interview-derek-lee-clif-prowse-afflicted/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=3 April 2014|archive-date=4 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404080959/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/351145-exclusive-interview-derek-lee-clif-prowse-afflicted/|url-status=live}}</ref> on a budget of $318,000.<ref name=\"budget\"/> Funding was raised through a small grant and through Prowse and Lee's family and friends.<ref name=\"STYD interview\" /> ''Afflicted'' was their first feature-length film, as the two had previous only created [[short film]]s together.<ref name=MP>{{cite web|last=Pierce|first=Scott|title=Interview: Reviving Found Footage In Afflicted|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/04/01/interview-reviving-found-footage-in-afflicted-1307481?lt_source=external,manual|publisher=Movie Pilot|accessdate=3 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085611/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2014/04/01/interview-reviving-found-footage-in-afflicted-1307481?lt_source=external,manual|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The movie's original concept was initially planned to be a [[web series]] akin to [[Lonelygirl15]] or [[Marble Hornets]], where the two would make posts and upload videos that would seem ordinary but grow more bizarre over time.<ref name=MP /> Of the concept, Prowse commented that \"You'd eventually have all these gaps because eventually the characters would stop posting and then the feature film would be this skeleton key that would click at the very end that you'd present.\"<ref name=MP /> They chose to make Derek's disease [[vampire|vampirism]], as they felt that vampires are usually in \"very stylized, cinematic, often melodramatic, and romanticized films\" and were not traditionally filmed otherwise.<ref name=\"STYD interview\" /><ref name=MP />\n\nAs the two were not familiar with filming in the found footage genre, Prowse and Lee found the filming challenging and commented that they had a lot of respect for the crews of films such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''.<ref name=MP /><ref name=AC>{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Feeding the 'Afflicted'|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2013-09-24/feeding-the-afflicted/|publisher=Austin Chronicle|accessdate=3 April 2014|archive-date=2014-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403081942/http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2013-09-24/feeding-the-afflicted/|url-status=live}}</ref> They commented that their choice to star as the film's protagonists helped make the process easier, as it allowed them more freedom to shoot and re-shoot scenes.<ref name=AC /> Lee commented that his role of \"Derek\" was very physically taxing due to the weather in Italy and the demands of the role.<ref name=\"STYD interview\" />\n\n==Promotion==\nThe film's [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] is notable for showing a selection of the characters' \"[[Travelogue (films)|travelogue]]\" scenes in reverse order: Entry 206, Entry 185, Entry 163, Entry 151, and so on, each scene suggesting the horrors that are growing throughout the story.
