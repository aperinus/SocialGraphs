The dialogue is mostly in French, with some English and much Spanish, a little Catalan, Danish, German and Italian.\n\nIt is the first part of the ''[[Spanish Apartment]]'' trilogy, which continues in the sequels ''[[Russian Dolls (film)|Russian Dolls]]'' (2005) and ''[[Chinese Puzzle]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite news|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2012/09/11/03002-20120911ARTFIG00498-cedric-klapisch-tourne-casse-tete-chinois-a-new-york.php |title=C\u00e9dric Klapisch tourne Casse-t\u00eate chinois \u00e0 New York |newspaper=[[Le Figaro]] |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nXavier ([[Romain Duris]]), a 24-year-old student from France, attends the [[Erasmus programme]] in Barcelona to further his career, against the wishes of his girlfriend Martine ([[Audrey Tautou]]). On the flight, Xavier meets a married couple from France, a doctor and his wife. They invite him to stay in their home while he looks for somewhere to live. Xavier finds a flatshare with students from England, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Denmark. The roommates develop a companionship as they struggle with their different languages and cultures.\n\nMartine visits Xavier and returns disappointed when she realizes things are not the same. Xavier begins an affair with the French doctor's wife, using seduction tips learned from Isabelle ([[C\u00e9cile de France]]), his lesbian roommate from Belgium. William arrives from England to visit his sister Wendy and creates tension with his abrasive manner and culturally insensitive comments.\n\nXavier gets depressed and hallucinates after Martine breaks up with him. He seeks the doctor's advice, but the doctor tells Xavier that his wife has confessed everything, and tells him to stop seeing her.\n\nDiscord divides the roommates, but they come together to aid Wendy, who was nearly caught by her boyfriend in a romantic encounter with an American.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to his new close friends, Xavier returns to Paris and gets his desired job at the ministry, but realizes that his experiences in Spain have changed him. He subsequently runs away on his first day on the job and pursues his dream to become a writer, recounting the story of his experiences in the ''Auberge Espagnole''. Towards the end Xavier can be seen getting together with his now ex-girlfriend Martine as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Romain Duris]] as Xavier\n* [[Barnaby Metschurat]] as Tobias\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Anne-Sophie\n* [[C\u00e9cile de France]] as Isabelle\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Wendy\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Martine\n* [[Cristina Brondo]] as Soledad\n* [[Kevin Bishop]] as William\n* [[Wladimir Yordanoff]] as Jean-Michel Perrin\n* [[Federico D'Anna]] as Alessandro\n* [[Christian Pagh]] as Lars\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as The barman\n* [[Lise Lam\u00e9trie]] as The woman in the ministry\n* [[Martine Demaret]] as Xavier's mother\n* [[Jacno]] as Xavier's father\n* [[Olivier Raynal]] as Bruce\n* [[Iddo Goldberg]] as Alistair\n* [[Irene Montal\u00e0]] as Neus\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Title==\nThe phrase ''auberge espagnole'' is a French idiom, literally translated as \"Spanish inn\" or \"Spanish hotel\".
