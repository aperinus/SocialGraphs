It is an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to Zeffirelli's friend, internationally acclaimed [[opera]] [[diva]] [[Maria Callas]], whom he directed on stage in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', ''[[La traviata]]'', and ''[[Tosca]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was his last film before his death in 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe partially [[fiction]]alized film is set in 1977, the year in which Callas died, and centers on the making of a movie of [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''. The diva, whose now-ragged voice is well past its prime, is persuaded to star in it by longtime friend and former manager Larry Kelly, who abandoned classical music to become a [[rock music|rock]] [[impresario]]. He insists by [[lip-synch]]ing to her old recording she will recapture her lost youth and leave behind a priceless legacy for her admirers, and his theory is supported by Callas [[confidante]] and [[journalist]] Sarah Keller.\n\nOther characters include Michael, a handsome young painter of limited talent and ardent Callas fan with whom Larry is infatuated; Marco, the [[tenor]] who plays Don Jos\u00e9 in ''Carmen'' and flirts with his aging co-star, who responds to his advances; and Bruna, the housekeeper in Callas' [[Paris]] apartment.\n\nCallas' passion for music and faith in herself are restored by the finished film. She refuses to lip-synch more filmed operas but agrees to star in a screen adaptation of ''Tosca'' if it is filmed live, using her own voice. When the financial backers walk out and the contract is canceled, she demands that Larry destroy ''Carmen'', arguing its release would be contrary to her legacy of honest performances, even those she delivered on really awful nights when her fans wanted to close their ears and hide their eyes with embarrassment and disappointment.\n\n== Production notes ==\nThe film was made in [[Bucharest, Romania]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]], and Paris.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe costume designs were nominated for a [[Goya Awards|Goya Award]] in Spain and a Silver Ribbon by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe film grossed $445,996 in the US, \u20ac1,249,657 in Italy, and \u20ac278,631 in Spain.

A lip-synching hall of mirrors, it is essentially a piece of highbrow [[karaoke]] . . . Ms. Ardant displays an eerie command of the diva's body language: the way her lips could curl into an imperious sneer, her flame-throwing glare, her hands crossed prayerfully on her chest as she sank to her knees in agony. Yet there is something inescapably ghoulish in the spectacle of an actress (even a great one) lip-synching the role of an opera legend who is herself lip-synching to her old records to create a bogus product . . . If ''Callas Forever'' is compellingly acted . . . it is a skimpily produced movie that looks pasted together on a limited budget. The la-di-da ambience of divas and their courtiers rings true for its era, but the fussy hothouse atmosphere of unrestrained diva-worship is ultimately more than a little stifling.\"<ref name=\":0\">[https://movies.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/movies/05call.html ''The New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stated, \"The visual style is all Zeffirelli, and it is interesting that the opera-within-the-film is not skimped on, as is usually the case in films containing scenes from other productions. Indeed, most of the budget seems to have gone to the moments of ''Carmen'' that we see; they look sumptuous and robust, and the surrounding film looks, well, like a low-budget art movie . . . Ardant . . . [has] the fiery passion needed for ''Carmen'' . . . [and] excels at playing a temperamental diva.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041125/REVIEWS/41116003/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Deborah Young described the film as \"an impressionistic sketch\" and added, \"Opera buffs may be disappointed not to see their heroine depicted in her heyday, and casual viewers may be miffed not to get a [[melodrama]]tic replay of her affair with [[Aristotle Onassis]] . . . [the] main body of the movie is weighed down by flat, expository dialogue and a lot of pedestrian filming . . . however . . . the ''Carmen'' sequences, which make up a sizable chunk of the film and are far and away the pic's most exhilarating sections, are graceful and fluid.\"<ref name=\":1\">[http://www2.variety.com/ref.asp?u=IMDB&p=H2BE&sid=VE1117918780 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Guardian]]'', Peter Bradshaw called it \"a gallant, ghastly fantasy\" and added, \"half a pound of Roquefort left overnight in a glove compartment could not be cheesier. It's a camp extravaganza of such exquisite awfulness, such unembarrassable silliness, that you watch it hypnotised.\"<ref>[http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1354273,00.html ''The Guardian'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Mark Kermode]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' said it was \"directed by Zeffirelli like a man still living in the Seventies, replete with ostentatious zooms and unfashionably smouldering close-ups.\"<ref>[http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1355871,00.html ''The Observer'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' enthused, \"For Callas lovers, it doesn't get much better than this. The movie is rich with music and more than a few moments of painful exaltation, where the breath catches, the eyes fill and the skin tingles . . . Yet a familiarity with Callas or opera in general is hardly required for appreciating this film. Though [[Camp (style)|campy]] at times, ''Callas Forever'' is a generous offering, full of flamboyant characters and grand performances . . . [the Callas Zeffirelli] gives us [is] a woman blessed and cursed by a terrible gift that makes normal life meaningless, while giving her a glimpse into a transcendence that eludes her. There are other ways of presenting Callas, but this is an especially powerful one.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/11/24/DDG3H9VRHR1.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New York Observer]]'', [[Rex Reed]] opined, \"You will go away devastated and raving about the great French actress Fanny Ardant as Callas. It's a titanic performance that redefines the term \"tour de force.\"<ref>[http://www.nyobserver.com/pages/story.asp?ID=9790 ''New York Observer'' review]</ref>\n\nKevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"not only one of Zeffirelli's sumptuous productions but also a film that celebrates the sacredness of artistic integrity that to Zeffirelli Callas embodied fully . . . Ardant comes fully into her own in her portrayal of a great artist . . . [she] is a boldly striking beauty with a commanding star charisma . . . as an actress she has delved so deeply within herself that she doesn't have to resemble Callas closely because she has become her from frame one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.callasforever-themovie.com/kevinthomas.htm# |title=''Los Angeles Times'' review |access-date=2007-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010065435/http://www.callasforever-themovie.com/kevinthomas.htm# |archive-date=2007-10-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0274407}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|callas_forever}}\n\n{{Franco Zeffirelli}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2002 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:Italian biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:French biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Romanian biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language Romanian films]]\n[[Category:English-language Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Films about classical music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Zeffirelli]]\n[[Category:Films about opera]]\n[[Category:Films set in Romania]]\n[[Category:Films set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:2000s musical films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Maria Callas]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
