It was adapted by Williams and [[Hal Kanter]] and directed by [[Daniel Mann]], with stars [[Anna Magnani]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Marisa Pavan]] and [[Jo Van Fleet]]. Williams originally wrote the play for [[Italian people|Italian]] Anna Magnani to play on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] in 1951, but she declined the offer because of her difficulty with the English language at the time. By the time of this film adaptation, she was ready.<ref name=\"Osborne\" />\n\nAnna Magnani won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance, and the film won\n[[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] receiving five other nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Pavan.\n\n== Plot ==\nSerafina Delle Rose ([[Anna Magnani]]), a Sicilian seamstress, living in a community in proximity to the [[Gulf of Mexico]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wlrn.org/culture/2016-03-22/rose-tattoo-house-reborn-in-key-west|title=Rose Tattoo House Reborn In Key West |publisher=[[WLRN-FM]]|date=2016-03-22|accessdate=2022-05-06}}</ref> fiercely proud of and loyal to her truck-driving husband Rosario, is pregnant with her second child. While he is sleeping, Estelle ([[Virginia Grey]]) asks Serafina to make a shirt for her lover from some expensive silk material; Serafina does not know that the lover is Rosario, and that earlier that afternoon, Estelle got a tattoo of a rose on her chest to match Rosario's.\n\nThat night, Rosario is killed in an accident while trying to evade police during a smuggling run. When Serafina discovers her beloved husband's demise she collapses, and later the local doctor informs her daughter Rosa ([[Marisa Pavan]]) and the women of the neighborhood that Serafina has miscarried.\n\nThree years later, Serafina has become a recluse, allowing her appearance and reputation to deteriorate, to Rosa's embarrassment. Serafina decides to attend her daughter's graduation, but two women arrive demanding Serafina quickly mend their bandanas for a festival. Serafina reluctantly does so, but is appalled by their talk of men and reprimands them. One of the women, Bessie ([[Jo Van Fleet]]), takes offense and mocks Serafina with Rosario's infidelity. Serafina sits alone in the dark until Rosa comes home, and is infuriated when Rosa introduces her to her new sailor boyfriend Jack Hunter ([[Ben Cooper]]). After her interrogation, he confides that he is a virgin.  She forces him to vow before a statue of the Virgin Mary that he will respect Rosa's innocence.\n\nDetermined to find out the truth about her husband, Serafina heads to the church (where a bazaar is being held) to ask the priest if her husband had confessed to an affair with another woman. When he refuses to answer, she attacks him, and a truck driver named Alvaro ([[Burt Lancaster]]) pulls her off. Alvaro drives the dazed Serafina home in his banana truck, where she offers to repair his torn shirt. Serafina loans Alvaro the rose silk shirt that she had sewn the night of her husband's death until she is able to repair it, and they agree to meet later that night.\n\nAlvaro returns, having impulsively gotten a rose tattooed on his chest. Serafina is disgusted and tries to throw him out, then demands that Alvaro drive her to a club her husband used to attend. Once there, she meets Estelle, who confesses and shows Serafina the rose tattooed on her chest as a symbol of her love for Rosario. Returning home, Serafina smashes the urn containing Rosario's ashes, and invites Alvaro to return in the night.\n\nAlvaro turns up hours later severely intoxicated and, mortified by his actions, Serafina leaves him in a drunken stupor and retires to bed. That night Rosa returns home and falls asleep on the sofa; Alvaro awakens and, still drunk, mistakes Rosa for Serafina and tries to kiss her; Rosa wakes up and screams, and Serafina gets rid of him.\n\nThe following morning Serafina finds him on top of a boat mast outside her house begging for her forgiveness. Serafina and Rosa are extremely embarrassed and Serafina refuses to leave the house in order to make him come down, much to Rosa's frustration. At that moment Jack arrives and asks Serafina if he can marry Rosa. Serafina is stunned, but seeing that this is what Rosa wants she gives them her consent and they leave to be married. Serafina then calls Alvaro down from the boat mast before declaring in front of her neighbors that they have to pick up from where they left off the night before. They enter her house and shut the door. A lively pop tune<!-- ''The Sheik of Araby'', probably too much information here --> is heard starting up on Serafina's [[player piano]], along with the sounds of their partying and laughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Anna Magnani]] \u2013 Serafina Delle Rose\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] \u2013 Alvaro Mangiacavallo\n* [[Marisa Pavan]] \u2013 Rosa Delle Rose\n* [[Ben Cooper]] \u2013 Seaman Jack Hunter\n* [[Virginia Grey]] \u2013 Estelle Hohengarten\n* [[Jo Van Fleet]] \u2013 Bessie\n* Sandro Giglio \u2013 Father De Leo\n* [[Mimi Aguglia]] \u2013 Assunta\n* [[Florence Sundstrom]] \u2013 Flora\n* Jeanne Hart - Violetta\n\n==Production and release==\nMuch of the film was shot on location in [[Key West, Florida]], although the setting is not specifically mentioned in the film.
