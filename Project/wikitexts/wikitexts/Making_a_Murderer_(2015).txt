The show tells the story of [[Steven Avery]], a man from [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin]], who served 18 years in prison (1985-2003) after his [[wrongful conviction]] for the [[sexual assault]] and [[attempted murder]] of Penny Beerntsen. He was later charged with and convicted of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach. The connected story is that of Avery's nephew [[Brendan Dassey]], who was accused and convicted as an accessory in the murder of Halbach.\n\nThe first season mainly chronicles the period between 1985 and 2007, portraying Avery's 1985 arrest and conviction, his subsequent exoneration and release in 2003, the [[civil lawsuit]] Avery filed against Manitowoc County, his 2005 arrest, and his ensuing trial and conviction in 2007. It also depicts the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of Dassey, focusing on the accusations of [[false confession|coercion]] and [[Ineffective assistance of counsel|attorney ineptitude]].\n\nThe second season explores the aftermath of both Avery's and Dassey's convictions, focusing on Avery's and Dassey's families, the investigation and findings of Avery's new attorney [[Kathleen Zellner]], which supported the thesis of Avery's innocence and him being framed for the murder of Halbach, and Dassey's legal team's efforts in arguing that his confession was coerced by prosecutors and his [[constitutional right]]s were violated.\n\nThe first season premiered on [[Netflix]] on December 18, 2015.<ref name=\"cruzatlantic\">{{cite journal|last=Cruz|first=Lenika|date=December 18, 2015|title=Making a Murderer: An American Horror Story|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/making-murderer-netflix-review-steve-avery/420891/|journal=The Atlantic|access-date=December 20, 2015}}</ref> It was filmed over the course of 10 years, with the filmmakers moving back and forth from New York City to Wisconsin during filming.<ref name=\"nytreview\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/arts/television/review-making-a-murderer-true-crime-on-netflix.html?_r=0|title=Review: 'Making a Murderer,' True Crime on Netflix|last=Hale|first=Mike|date=December 16, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=December 20, 2015}}</ref> To promote the series, Netflix released the first episode concurrently on [[YouTube]] and on Netflix, which it had not done for any other original programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/netflix-series-brings-worldwide-spotlight-to-steven-avery-case-b99639845z1-363521841.html|title=Netflix series brings worldwide spotlight to Steven Avery case|last=Vielmetti|first=Bruce|date=December 25, 2015|website=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Netflix announced the second season, to explore the aftermath of Dassey's conviction and the numerous appeals that had taken place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/making-a-murderer-season-2-new-episodes-netflix-1201817364/|title='Making a Murderer' Gets New Episodes on Netflix|website=Variety|first=Laura|last=Prudom|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=July 19, 2016}}</ref> The 10-episode second season was released on October 19, 2018.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/new-making-murderer-season-two-teaser-728909/|title='Making a Murderer': Watch Chilling Season Two Teaser|magazine=Rolling Stone|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=September 25, 2018|access-date=September 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Making a Murderer'' won several awards, including four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s in 2016.

In 1985, Avery was arrested and [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of the [[sexual assault]] of Penny Beerntsen, despite having an alibi. After serving 18 years in prison, Avery was exonerated with the aid of the [[Innocence Project]], when the [[DNA]] in the case was matched to another man. After Avery was released from prison in 2003, he filed a $36 million [[civil lawsuit]] against Manitowoc County and several county officials associated with his arrest and conviction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lenk, Colborn, O'Kelly: Where are they now?|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/steven-avery/2016/01/15/lenk-colborn-okelly-where-they-now/78840672/|website=Post-Crescent Media|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in 2005, Avery was arrested and charged with the murder of Teresa Halbach, a photographer who disappeared after she photographed a vehicle at Avery's salvage yard.
