Scott]]. Adapted from a story by [[Jonas McCord]], the plot follows Andy and Tracy Safian, a newlywed couple whose lives are upturned after they rent part of their Victorian home to Jed, a cavalier surgeon; things are further complicated when he removes Tracy's [[ovaries]] during an emergency surgery to save her life. The film features supporting performances from [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Peter Gallagher]], and [[Tobin Bell]], with minor appearances from [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Brenda Strong]].\n\nReleased in the fall of 1993, ''Malice'' grossed a total of $61 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAndy and Tracy Safian are a newlywed couple living in a [[Victorian house]] that they are restoring in [[Western Massachusetts]]. He is an [[Dean (education)|Associate Dean]] at a local [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], while his wife teaches art to children. They hope to start a family soon. One night before making love, they notice the young boy next door at his window, seemingly watching them. They jokingly refer to him as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]].\n\nWhen a student on campus is attacked and seriously wounded by a [[serial rape|serial rapist]], Dr. Jed Hill, a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Andy meets Jed to thank him for saving the student and realizes that they attended high school together. Andy and Jed quickly strike up a friendship. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. Tracy is unhappy that Andy has invited Jed to live with them. She describes Jed as arrogant. Jed brings home a woman and causes noise disturbance late at night, to Tracy\u2019s annoyance.\n\nAndy finds the body of one his students, who has been raped and murdered by the serial rapist. Police detective Dana Harris interviews him as a possible suspect and asks him to provide a [[semen]] sample. While leaving the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized for severe pain in her abdomen and is being operated on by Jed. While removing one of Tracy's [[ovary|ovaries]], which has ruptured due to a [[cyst]], Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the surgery causes the [[fetus]] to [[spontaneous abortion|abort]]. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is [[Ovarian torsion|torsed]] and appears [[necrotic]]. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed removes it, overruling the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. Tracy tells Jed she's suing him for malpractice.\n\nDuring a deposition in which Jed is accused of having a [[God complex]], Jed delivers a monologue proudly claiming himself infallible as a surgeon, asserting \"I am God,\" due to his ability to heal patients, then storms out. With Hill absent, Tracy's lawyer reveals that Jed had been in a bar the night of the operation.  \"Ask God how many shots of bourbon he had before he cut me open,\" Tracy tells the hospital's attorneys.  Fearful of the negative publicity that would result from a civil trial, the hospital and Jed's insurance company [[Settlement (litigation)|settle]] with Andy and Tracy for $20 million. However, Tracy leaves Andy, telling him that she can't forgive him for the loss of her ability to have children.\n\nAndy discovers that the serial rapist is a handyman at the college named Earl. After a struggle, Andy subdues him and Earl is arrested, thus clearing Andy of the crimes. In the aftermath, Dana informs Andy that his semen sample indicated that he was [[male infertility|sterile]], thereby revealing he wasn't the father of the aborted child. Andy confronts Tracy's lawyer, Dennis Riley, accusing him of having impregnated Tracy. Riley calmly asserts his innocence, but tells Andy that Tracy's mother \u2014 who she had told Andy had died 12 years ago \u2014 can answer all of his questions. Riley refuses to break [[Attorney\u2013client privilege|lawyer-client privilege]], but tells Andy to take a bottle of [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] to her.\n\nAndy tracks down Mrs. Kennsinger, who tells Andy that Tracy is a lifelong [[con artist]]. As a younger woman, she had an affair with a wealthy man, who paid for her to have an abortion; Tracy kept the money and had it done at a clinic, beginning her career as a con woman. Andy subsequently learns that Tracy and Jed had been carrying on an affair for some time. Tracy had arranged for Jed to move into the house so that he could begin overdosing her with a drug to intentionally cause the ovarian cyst. Andy confronts Tracy and tells her he wants half of the settlement money. Suspecting that she might try to murder him, Andy implies their next-door neighbor, the ten-year-old boy who's been their seeming voyeur, is named in his will as a potential police witness to her and Jed's nefarious activities.\n\nJed tells Tracy to give Andy what he wants so they can leave the country, but Tracy instead suggests murdering the boy. Jed refuses to kill a child, so Tracy shoots Jed, fatally. She then slips into the neighbor's house and attempts to suffocate the boy in his chair, only to find a dummy in his place. An enraged Tracy begins to destroy the dummy and attacks Andy after he walks in on her. They fall from the second floor, but they both survive. Detective Harris appears and arrests her, revealing that the boy's supposed agreement to testify against her was part of a [[sting operation]] to catch her in the act of attempted murder.\n\nAs Tracy is led away in handcuffs, the boy and his mother return home. As Tracy is taken to the police cruiser, Tracy sees that the boy is, in fact, [[Visual impairment|blind]]. Andy leaves with Dana to have a drink of Scotch.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Dr. Jed Hill\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Tracy Safian\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Andy Safian\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Det.
