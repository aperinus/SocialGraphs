Centred on the sport of [[curling]], the offbeat comedy tells the story of a reunited curling team from a small Canadian town as they work through their respective life issues and struggle to win the championship for the sake of their late coach.\n\nThe cast also includes [[Connor Price]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Peter Outerbridge]], [[Kari Matchett]], [[Molly Parker]] and [[Polly Shannon]]. Members of the Canadian rock band [[The Tragically Hip]] make a cameo appearance in the film as a competing rink representing [[Kingston, Ontario]], the band's home city. Winnipeg curler and three-time [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] champion [[Jeff Stoughton]] also made a cameo appearance throwing his [[trademark look|trademark]] \"spin-o-rama\" shot.\n\nA television adaptation, also titled ''[[Men with Brooms (TV series)|Men with Brooms]]'' debuted October 4, 2010 on [[CBC Television]] for the 2010-11 television season.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with Donald Foley retrieving curling stones from a lake near Long Bay, Ontario.  Foley dies after retrieving the stones, and a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will demands that curling [[Glossary of curling terms#Rink|rink]] he formerly coached be re-assembled, and enter a [[bonspiel]] to win the Golden Broom by placing a stone containing his ashes on the button. The team's skip, Chris Cutter, had skipped town ten years ago over the shame of failing to call a burnt stone, abandoning his fianc\u00e9e Julie Foley (Donald's daughter) at the altar, and throwing the team's stones into the lake. Chris returns to Long Bay, where he convinces the former members of his team, Neil Bucyk, James Lennox, and Eddie Strombeck, to enter the competition for the Golden Broom. While the rink practices for the Golden Broom tournament, Chris tries to make amends with Julie, which is complicated by his feelings for her younger sister Amy.  Neil deals with his resentment towards his wife, and unhappiness at running a funeral home inherited from his father in law. Eddie deals with his low sperm count and dissatisfaction about being unable to father children. James is working as a minor drug dealer, and tries to raise money to pay off a supplier to whom he is indebted.<ref name = \"ENCOSPO\">{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Sports Films |author1=K Edgington |author2=Thomas Erskine |author3=James M.

Chris reconciles with his estranged father Gordon Cutter, so he will coach the team.  Gordon trains the team for the upcoming bonspiel. In the first match of the bonspiel, the rink plays another rink, skipped by former Olympian Alexander Yount.  Chris again fails to call a burnt stone, demoralising himself, the rest of his rink, and his father. Chris goes drinking at a bar, where Amy meets him and informs him she and Julie have come to an understanding; Julie accepts that Chris and Amy love one another, and once Chris accepts it they can be together.  Julie, meanwhile, will be blasted off into space. Chris goes to his mother's grave where he encounters his father; the two reconcile, and Gordon tells Chris to go be with Amy.<ref name = \"ENCOSPO\" />\n\nNeil quits the rink, and is replaced by Gordon. However, in the second to last match, Gordon once again throws out his back and is unable to curl. However, Chris and his rink manage to win the match. In the final match of the bonspiel, the rink once again meets Yount's rink. With Gordon injured, Chris is forced to curl with a rink of three. Down 6-0 early, Gordon laments that they \"need a good lead man.\" At this time, Neil and his wife are at the country club. Joanne rushes to the club and convinces Neil to rejoin the rink. Chris and his rink stage a comeback, and are now within victory. On the critical final shot, one of the sweepers burns the stone, noticed only by Chris. In this instance, Chris calls the burn.  Yount allows Chris to retake the shot, to which Chris changes up his shot. Chris throws the rock directly at the centre of the house, smashing it and the rock it collided with. A large piece of granite lands directly on the button, along with Coach Foley's ashes. Chris and his rink have not only won the Golden Broom bonspiel, but have also fulfilled Coach Finley's final wish.<ref name = \"ENCOSPO\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Paul Gross]] as Chris Cutter\n*[[Peter Outerbridge]] as James Lennox\n*[[Jed Rees]] as Eddie Strombeck\n*[[James Allodi]] as Neil Bucyk\n*James B.

Lantos had an idea for a [[ice hockey|hockey]] film: \"I talked to (co-writer) [[John Krizanc]] about it, but it was too complicated with that number of characters. Besides, hockey is political. It's hard to talk hockey in this country since we think of it as our game, but it's largely owned by others.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSF/is_36_10/ai_86043584/print|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}</ref>   Gross solved those problems by replacing hockey with curling.\n\nIn October 2000, Gross was still working on the script with Krizanc and another writer, [[Paul Quarrington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbackonline.ca/articles/magazine/20001002/30032.html?print=yes|title=Bellwood does second flick|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production and filming===\nAccording to Thom Best (the film's director of photography),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbackonline.ca/articles/magazine/20020401/cine.html?print=yes&word=Brooms|title=Best sweeps his way to the top|publisher=}}</ref> the film had three weeks of [[pre-production]], which mostly consisted of scouting locations in [[Ontario]].
