Written by Glenn German and Adam Rodgers, the film follows a man and a woman as they meet and fall in love while taking their children on a college tour. The film had its world premiere at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] on May 17, 2013.<ref name=\"EW\"/> It was released in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]] on January 31, 2014 by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay Films]].<ref name=\"Fandango\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/atmiddleton_170029/movieoverview|title=At Middleton (2014)|website=[[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]]|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEdith Martin and her highly strung daughter Audrey, and George Hartman and his unmotivated son Conrad, arrive for a campus tour of the quaint Middleton College led by junior \"dingleberry\" Justin. When Edith and George wander off, the two bond as they try to reunite with the tour. When they meet the group in the library, Edith and George embarrass their children.\n\nAudrey accuses Edith of not supporting her decision to go to Middleton, and as revenge, Edith lies and says that she and George are taking an exclusive tour of the campus with the university's Dean. Audrey and Conrad are then left alone with the rest of the \"cookie cutter\" tour, while Edith and George play hooky. The two borrow some bikes to explore the campus. They climb to the top of the belltower, and sneak into an acting class. During an acting exercise, the two emotionally connect.\n\nMeanwhile, Audrey tells Conrad that the reason she wants to attend Middleton is so she can be mentored by Middleton's acclaimed professor Roland Emerson. Conrad says he's keeping his options open. At lunch, Audrey calls the Dean's assistant, and finds out that Edith was lying about the exclusive tour. She then bumps into George and demands to know where her mother is. He tells her that Edith went to the observatory, when she is really having lunch with George in the cafeteria. Edith and George discuss their relationship, unsure of what it is since they are both married.\n\nAudrey and Conrad go to the observatory, finding it locked. In her anger, Audrey insults Conrad, saying he's peaked in life and it's all downhill for him; Conrad walks off. George and Edith then meet film student Daphne, who offers George her computer so he can help out a heart patient. Edith and George then get high with Daphne and her boyfriend Travis, and discuss their relationships with their children.\n\nAudrey and Conrad go to their respective meetings with professors. Audrey has tea with Emerson, while Conrad meets Boneyard Sims, who runs the campus' radio station. Audrey finds out that Emerson is going on a sabbatical, meaning he won't be able to be her advisor should she attend Middleton. Audrey reacts angrily, and Emerson warns her that she might've crossed the line from ambition into obsession. Conrad realizes his interest is in radio.\n\nEdith and George go back to the belltower, where they spend an intimate moment. Conrad apologizes to Audrey for her bad day, and informs her that he could see himself going to Middleton; Audrey tells him she no longer wants to go there. As Edith and George head back to their cars, they emotionally part ways. The two then embrace their children and drive off. Edith tells Audrey that they're going to be okay, and George requests Conrad take the long way home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as George Hartman\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Edith Martin\n* [[Taissa Farmiga]] as Audrey Martin\n* [[Spencer Lofranco]] as Conrad Hartman\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Boneyard Sims\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Roland Emerson\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Justin \"Dingleberry\"\n* Daniella Garc\u00eda as Daphne\n* Stephen Borrello as Travis\n* [[Mirjana Jokovic]] as Professor Riley\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film was directed by Adam Rodgers, and co-written by Rodgers and Glenn German.

At least the ending is brazen enough not to conclude in a tidy fashion.

At others times, it serves to underscore what might have been. It's a feckless conundrum. Edith (Farmiga) is the free-spirited mom. Audrey is her serious, literary-minded daughter, nicely played by Farmiga's real-life sister Taissa, who shares Vera's luminous presence on screen. George (Garcia) is a cardiac surgeon, nattily uptight in his crisp white shirt and bow tie. He's with his reluctant son Conrad (Spencer Lofranco)... Together, Garcia and Farmiga are a sweetheart couple whose mild flirtation makes the time spent ''At Middleton'' bearable. With a stronger script, it might have turned into a beautiful day.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-at-middleton-review-20140131-story.html|title='At Middleton' romantic comedy gets a middling grade|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Sharkey|first=Betsy|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
