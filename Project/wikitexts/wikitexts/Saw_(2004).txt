It is the first installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]], and stars Whannell, [[Cary Elwes]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Monica Potter]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Ken Leung]], and [[Tobin Bell]]. The film tells a [[nonlinear narrative]], revolving around the mystery of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], who tests his victims' will to live by putting them through deadly \"games\" where they must inflict great physical pain upon themselves to survive. The [[frame story]] follows Jigsaw's latest victims (Whannell and Elwes), who awaken in a large, dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other to save his own family.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Whannell, who co-created the story with Wan in their respective screenwriting debuts. It was originally written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] short film [[Saw (2003 film)|of the same name]] from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from [[Evolution Entertainment]] were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label, [[Twisted Pictures]]. The film was given a small budget of $1.2 million and was shot in 18 days.\n\n''Saw'' was first screened on January 19, 2004, before being released in North America on October 29, 2004, by [[Lionsgate Films]]. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics but grossed more than $100 million worldwide to become one of the most profitable horror films since ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The film has since gained a [[Cult film|cult following]] and has been frequently credited as one of the most revolutionary horror films of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/movies/saw-review-revisited-looking-back-james-wan-leigh-whannell-horror-film-1295883.html|title=Saw revisited: Looking back at the film that changed the horror genre forever|first=Daniel|last=Falconer|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|access-date=January 25, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/570087/saw-at-15/|title=Saw at 15: Changing the Course of Modern Horror|first=Kalyn|last=Corrigan|date=October 29, 2019|website=SlashFilm.com|access-date=January 25, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popdust.com/saw-horror-movie-2641106787.html|title=15 Years Later: How \"Saw\" Changed the Horror Genre|date=October 27, 2019|website=Popdust.com|access-date=January 25, 2022}}</ref> It was theatrically re-released, to select theaters, on October 31, 2014, to celebrate its tenth anniversary.<ref name=\"IGNAug2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/27/saw-returning-to-theaters-for-its-10th-anniversary|title=Saw returning to theaters for its 10th anniversary|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=August 28, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014}}</ref> The first sequel, titled ''[[Saw II]]'', was released in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nPhotographer [[List of Saw characters#Adam Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]] awakens in a dilapidated bathtub, with his ankle chained to a pipe. Across the room is [[Oncology|oncologist]] [[List of Saw characters#menGordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], also chained, and between them is the corpse of an apparent [[suicide]] victim holding a [[revolver]] and a [[microcassette]] recorder. Both men find a tape in their pockets, and Adam retrieves the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to survive, while Gordon's tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock or [[List of Saw characters#Alison and Diana Gordon|his wife Alison and daughter Diana]] will be killed. Adam finds a bag containing two [[hacksaw]]s inside the toilet which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks. Gordon realizes the saws are meant for their feet, and identifies their captor as the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]\u2014a [[serial killer]] testing his victims' will to survive through lethal traps referred to as \"games\", whom Gordon knows of because he was once a suspect.\n\nFive months prior, Gordon, while discussing the terminal brain cancer of patient John Kramer, was interrogated by Detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who found his penlight at the scene of one of Jigsaw's games. Gordon's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of [[heroin]] addict [[Amanda Young]], the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's traps, who had been forced to disembowel a man to obtain a key to free herself. After Gordon's release, Tapp and Sing find Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. There, they apprehend Jigsaw and save a man from a trap, but Jigsaw injures Tapp and escapes. Sing pursues Jigsaw down a hallway where he accidentally triggers a shotgun trap and is killed.\n\nIn the present, Alison and Diana are held captive at their apartment as their captor watches Adam and Gordon through a hidden camera. The house is simultaneously watched by Tapp who, after being discharged from the police following Sing's death, has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case, and remains convinced that Gordon is the killer. Meanwhile, Gordon finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone. He recounts his abduction in a parking garage by a pig-masked figure. Adam recalls his own abduction when he returned home to find [[Billy the Puppet|a puppet]] in his [[darkroom]], where he stored photos of Gordon.\n\nAlison, held at gunpoint, calls her husband and warns him not to believe Adam. Adam admits to Gordon that he was paid by Tapp to spy on him, and reveals his knowledge of Gordon's affair with one of his medical students whom he had visited the night he was abducted; Gordon deduces the affair is the reason he is being tested. Adam finds a photo of Alison and Diana's captor whom Gordon identifies as [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], a hospital orderly.\n\nOnce the clock strikes six, Zep, seeing that Gordon has still not killed Adam, moves to murder Alison and Diana, but the former frees herself and fights him. The struggle attracts Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana before chasing Zep to the sewers, where he is shot in the chest after a brief fight. Gordon, only aware of the gunshots and screaming, is shocked and loses reach of the cell phone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Gordon but Adam, having survived the gunshot, bludgeons him to death with a toilet tank lid. Gordon crawls out of the bathroom to find help while Adam searches Zep's body for a key. He finds another tape, revealing that Zep was just another victim of Jigsaw following rules to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body.\n\nThe corpse in the room rises and is revealed to be John Kramer, the real Jigsaw Killer. He tells Adam that the key to his ankle chain was in the bathtub; it went down the drain when Adam had first awoken and drained the water. Horrified, Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John electrically shocks him through his chain, exits the bathroom, and says \"Game Over\" before sealing the door, leaving a helpless Adam to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Adam Stanheight\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Lawrence Gordon\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[David Tapp|Detective David Tapp]]\n* [[Ken Leung]] as Detective Steven Sing\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Detective Allison Kerry\n* Mike Butters as Paul Leahy\n* [[Paul Gutrecht]] as Mark Wilson\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as Zep Hindle\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Brett\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Makenzie Vega]] as Diana Gordon\n* [[Monica Potter]] as Alison Gordon\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as Jeff Ridenhour\n* Hans Raith as A Detective\n* [[Alexandra Bokyun Chun|Alexandra Chun]] as Carla Song\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n}}\n\nAdditionally, producer [[Oren Koules]] appears as Donnie Greco in an uncredited role.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|Wan (left) and Whannell (right)]]\nAfter finishing film school, Australian director [[James Wan]] and Australian writer [[Leigh Whannell]] wanted to write and fund a film.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/saw-creators-leigh-whannell-and-james-wan,46975/ |title=Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan |last=Tobias |first=Scott |work=[[The A.V.

In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt ''Seven'' was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo ''Seven''.

In light of it\u2019s small production budget of $1.2 million, the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking.

More than anything, the premise of the film\u2019s twisted take on morality is a story made truly for horror fans; it's gory, it's depraved, and, best of all, it introduced a new horror icon in the form of a doll on a child\u2019s bicycle accompanied with a message on a tape recorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18425 |title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade ...
