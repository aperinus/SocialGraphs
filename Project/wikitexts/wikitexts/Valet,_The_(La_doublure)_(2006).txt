An English-language remake, ''[[The Valet (2022 film)|The Valet]]'', was released on 20 May 2022 by [[Hulu]].\n\n==Plot==\nPierre Levasseur is a wealthy married Parisian executive involved in an affair with top model Elena Simonsen. When a [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] catches the two of them departing their secret hideaway and their photograph is published on the front page of the local newspaper, Pierre's wife Christine confronts him. He claims he has no idea who the woman is, and that she must have been a companion of the man seen walking beside them. Fully aware of  Pierre's difficult situation, Elena gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between her and his wife. Because Christine is the majority shareholder of his business, Pierre is in danger of losing his fortune if he divorces her. His lawyer Ma\u00eetre Foix advises him the only way to resolve the issue is to find the anonymous man in the photo and have him pose as Elena's lover.\n\nThe anonymous man is the hapless Fran\u00e7ois Pignon, a parking valet who is in love with bookstore owner \u00c9milie. Deep in debt and worried about her business, she has turned down his marriage proposal because she believes she has too much on her plate, and thinks of him as a brother. Meanwhile, Ma\u00eetre Foix locates Fran\u00e7ois and offers him money to let Elena move in with him and pretend they are a couple. Fran\u00e7ois agrees and asks for 32,450 euros: the exact amount of money that will pay off \u00c9milie's debts. Meanwhile, Elena demands 20 million euros to participate in the sham relationship, a sum she keeps as a deposit that she will return to Pierre when he leaves his wife. Dislodging his friend and roommate Richard, Elena moves in with Fran\u00e7ois, who is overwhelmed by the situation, but the two quickly become friends.\n\nChristine is not fooled and plays the situation for all it is worth, making her husband jealous of Fran\u00e7ois and Elena's living situation. \u00c9milie, too, is confused and upset to see Fran\u00e7ois and Elena together. Eventually, Elena explains the situation to \u00c9milie, who is grateful for the funding Fran\u00e7ois requested for her, and she acquires a newfound respect for him and eventually accepts Fran\u00e7ois' proposal.\n\nIn the meantime, Christine secretly tape records Pierre saying he has no intention of leaving her for Elena and offering to take his wife on a second honeymoon. When she sends the tape to Elena, Elena decides to leave Pierre. She notifies Pierre of her leaving by sending Fran\u00e7ois to meet him in her car at a secret rendezvous point. Fran\u00e7ois conveys the news to Pierre who angrily responds that he has voided the 20 million euro transfer. Fran\u00e7ois then tells Pierre that Elena anticipated this of him and indicates that she never wanted the money implying that Elena leaves the relationship with a clean split. Fran\u00e7ois then walks away from the limo as a cross-dressing prostitute approaches Pierre and the two are photographed by a paparazzo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Pierre Levasseur\n* [[Richard Berry (actor)|Richard Berry]] as Lawyer Foix\n* [[Gad Elmaleh]] as Fran\u00e7ois Pignon\n* [[Alice Taglioni]] as Elena Simonsen\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Christine Levasseur\n* [[Virginie Ledoyen]] as \u00c9milie\n* [[Dany Boon]] as Richard\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Garcia]] as Louise\n* [[Michel Aumont]] as doctor\n* [[Michel Jonasz]] as Andr\u00e9 Pignon\n* [[No\u00e9mie Lenoir]] as Karine\n* [[Laurent Gamelon]] as Paul\n* [[Karl Lagerfeld]] as himself\n* [[Ellie Harvie]] as restaurant manager\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFran\u00e7ois Pignon also is the name of the protagonist in screenwriter-director Francis Veber's films ''[[Les Comp\u00e8res]]'' (1983), ''[[The Dinner Game]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Closet (2001 film)|The Closet]]'' (2001), although the characters are not the same person. The film also makes a reference to ''The Dinner Game'' during a scene. Fran\u00e7ois gives his father, Andr\u00e9, a corkscrew as a birthday present. Andr\u00e9 then mentions that he has even been invited to dinner to talk about his passion and collection of corkscrews.\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], and [[Puteaux]], all located in the ''[[D\u00e9partements of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Hauts-de-Seine]].\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a delectable comedy\" and added, \"Francis Veber ... is a master of the modern French farce. And this film has the same tight structure and carefully plotted surprises and reversals as his earlier comedies ''The Dinner Game'' and ''The Closet''. These movies are wonderfully frothy contrivances, built with traditional machinery from models that have been around for centuries ... Because its structure and the targets of its satire\u2014vanity, greed and lust\u2014hark back to [[Moli\u00e8re]], ''The Valet'' offers a reassuring vision of a fixed social order, bourgeois to the core, in which virtue is rewarded and hubris exposed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/movies/20vale.html|title=Wanted: A Third Party to Complete Love Triangle|first=Stephen|last=Holden|authorlink=Stephen Holden|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 April 2007|access-date=3 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it \"an enjoyable farce, with lots of laughs and a strong cast.\" He observed, \"At 80 minutes long, it's that rare case of a short film that should have been longer. And that's its problem: It really should have been longer. This is not just a matter of wishing the pleasure might have been extended. The comparative shortness is indicative, rather, of the movie's sole flaw: Veber doesn't know how to end his movie. True, he knows how the audience would like the story to resolve, and he does get there. But he doesn't find a mechanically interesting way to do it. After putting this wonderful machinery in place, he more or less just pulls the plug. He ties things up quickly with a couple of pleasant but lackluster scenes and gets out, leaving the movie feeling truncated. Fine. If he couldn't come up with a great ending, at least he didn't belabor it, and along the way ''The Valet'' is a total pleasure.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Here-are-my-car-keys-And-here-s-my-girlfriend-2599329.php|title=Here are my car keys.

A complete master of cinematic farce, Veber's latest venture ... makes creating deliciously funny comedy look a lot easier than it has any right to ... While some of the sight gags on view in ''The Valet'' have roots that go back to the great silent clowns, Veber's innate understanding of what makes people laugh, his gift for impeccable timing and for getting his cast to work together like interlocking parts of a fine machine, are difficult to resist.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-apr-20-et-valet20-story.html|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Turan|title=\u2018Valet\u2019 parking is recommended|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=20 April 2007|access-date=3 October 2021}}</ref>\n\nLisa Nesselson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"Even though you can hear the clockwork mechanism ticking, comic craftsman Francis Veber ... has tooled another bigscreen timepiece with a fun premise and satisfying quotient of laughs.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/reviews/the-valet-1200517318/|last=Nesselson|first=Lisa|title=The Valet|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=30 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was released in France and Belgium on March 20, 2006.

''Do Knot Disturb'' later inspired the 2014 Punjabi movie ''[[Disco Singh]]'' and the 2016 Bengali movie ''[[Haripad Bandwala]]''.\n\nAn English-language remake of ''The Valet'' has long been in the works.
