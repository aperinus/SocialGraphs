It was released in the United States on {{nowrap|July 1, 2011}}.\n\n==Plot==\n\nLarry Crowne, a middle-aged [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[veteran]], is fired from his job at a [[big-box store]] due to a lack of college education, despite his seniority and exemplary work.  Larry, who is divorced and lives alone, cannot find a job and could lose his house. His neighbor, Lamar, suggests he enroll at East Valley Community College and get an education.\n\nSubsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]], Larry buys a scooter from Lamar. At the college, he becomes part of a colorful community trying to find a better future, he is nicknamed \"Lance Corona\" by classmate Talia. Two of the classes he takes are speech, taught by Mercedes Tainot and economics, taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani. While initially struggling in speech class, he does very well in economics.\n\nMercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean, a former professor-turned-writer-turned-blogger. In reality, Dean spends his days looking at internet porn.\n\nTalia invites Larry to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo. She also updates Larry's home decor, hair style, and wardrobe. His friend Frank, who runs the diner, offers him a job to help make ends meet, as Larry had been a Navy cook.\n\nAfter a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop, where Larry and his scooter gang notice her. He offers her a ride home, which she reluctantly accepts. On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for [[drunk driving]]. \n\nAt her front door, Mercedes invites Larry to kiss her and they hug, before she passionately starts kissing him. She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state. When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn.\n\nRealizing there is no way he will not lose his house, Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a [[strategic default|strategic foreclosure]]. Mercedes, meanwhile, warns Larry not to disclose the events of the previous night, and remains under the false impression that he is romantically involved with the much-younger Talia. It disappoints Larry, who had been excited about Mercedes' interest in him. He goes back to concentrating on his studies and his new job instead.\n\nMercedes runs into Talia, who is telling Frances, her English teacher, that she will be dropping out of college to start a [[thrift store]]. There, she finds out that Talia and Larry are just friends. Later, Frances comes over to Mercedes' to provide emotional support due to her divorce.\n\nFinals arrive, and Larry is scheduled last. His speech is about his travels around the world while in the Navy, and also manages to include all of his classmates' topics within his own. He is given a big round of applause by his classmates and an A-plus grade from Mercedes, who is now happier in her life, and has rediscovered her passion for teaching.\n\nA short while later, Mercedes and Frances show up at Larry's diner. She lets him know that he was an excellent student, to which he replies that she was an excellent teacher.  When the next term begins, some of the students from Mercedes' speech course register for her [[Shakespeare]] class, but Larry is not with them. He is seen taking Dr. Matsutani's second-term Economics class.  \n\nMercedes walks to her office and sees a note from Larry on the door, which is an invitation for French toast, with the address to his new apartment. She drives there and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Larry Crowne\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Mercedes \"Mercy\" Tainot\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Talia\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Dell Gordo\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Frances\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Lamar\n* [[Taraji P.
