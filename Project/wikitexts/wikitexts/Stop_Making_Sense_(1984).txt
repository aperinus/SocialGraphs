The concert serves as a comprehensive retrospective of the band's history to that time, featuring many of their popular songs from their first hit single \"[[Psycho Killer]]\", through to their most recent album. In addition, the group performs one song, \"[[Genius of Love]]\", by the [[Tom Tom Club]], a side project for two members of the band. The film is the first made entirely using [[digital audio]] techniques. The band raised the budget of $1.2 million themselves.\n\nThe four core members of [[Talking Heads]]: lead singer and guitarist [[David Byrne]], drummer [[Chris Frantz]], guitarist and keyboardist [[Jerry Harrison]], and bassist [[Tina Weymouth]], are joined on stage by an extensive supporting band including backing singers [[Lynn Mabry]] and Ednah Holt, guitarist [[Alex Weir (musician)|Alex Weir]], keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], and percussionist Steve Scales.\n\n''Stop Making Sense'' is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest concert films of all time. [[Leonard Maltin]] called it \"one of the greatest rock movies ever made\", [[Robert Christgau]] \"the finest concert film\", and [[Pauline Kael]] \"close to perfection\". \nIt is considered a [[cult classic]].<ref>[https://siskelebert.org/?p=6069 Cult Movies on Videocassette, 1987 - Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews]</ref>\n\nIn 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/news/talking-heads-stop-making-sense-added-to-national-film-registry/ Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense Added to National Film Registry|Pitchfork]</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nLead singer [[David Byrne]] walks on to a bare stage with a portable [[cassette tape]] player and an acoustic guitar. He introduces \"[[Psycho Killer]]\" by saying he wants to play a tape, but in reality a [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine starts playing from the [[mixing board]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/12/beat_box_review_drum_machine_gets_its_due_in_joe_mansfield_book.html|title=Select-a-Rhythm|last=Hamilton|first=Jack|date=December 5, 2012|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=March 21, 2018|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]]}}</ref> The gunshot-like beats cause Byrne to stagger \"like [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] in the final minutes of <nowiki>'</nowiki>''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'',' a hero succumbing, surprised, to violence that he'd thought he was prepared for.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/1999/09/16/sense/|title=Stop Making Sense|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|date=September 17, 1999|work=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|access-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith each successive song, Byrne is joined by more members of the band: first by [[Tina Weymouth]] for \"[[Heaven (Talking Heads song)|Heaven]]\" (with [[Lynn Mabry]] providing harmony vocals from backstage), second by [[Chris Frantz]] for \"Thank You for Sending Me an Angel\", and third by [[Jerry Harrison]] for \"Found a Job\". Performance equipment is wheeled out and added to the set to accommodate the additional musicians: back-up singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt, keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], percussionist Steve Scales, and [[guitarist]] [[Alex Weir (musician)|Alex Weir]]. The first song to feature the entire lineup is \"[[Burning Down the House]]\", although the original 1985 RCA/Columbia Home Video release (which featured three additional songs in two performances edited into the film) has the entire band (minus Worrell) performing \"[[Cities (song)|Cities]]\" before this song. Byrne leaves the stage at one point to allow the Weymouth\u2013Frantz-led side-band [[Tom Tom Club]] to perform their song \"[[Genius of Love]]\". The band also performs two songs from Byrne's soundtrack album ''[[The Catherine Wheel (album)|The Catherine Wheel]]'', \"What a Day That Was\" and (as a bonus song on the home video release) \"Big Business\".\n\nThe film includes Byrne's \"big suit\", an absurdly large business suit that he wears for the song \"Girlfriend Is Better\". The suit was partly inspired by [[Noh]] theatre styles, and became an icon not only of the film \u2013 as it appears on the movie poster, for instance \u2013 but of Byrne himself. Byrne said: \"I was in Japan in between tours and I was checking out traditional Japanese theater \u2013 [[Kabuki]], Noh, [[Bunraku]] \u2013 and I was wondering what to wear on our upcoming tour. A fashion designer friend (Jurgen Lehl) said in his typically droll manner, 'Well David, everything is bigger on stage.' He was referring to gestures and all that, but I applied the idea to a businessman's suit.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://time.com/2980989/stop-making-sense-anniversary-david-byrne-jonathan-demme/ |

Demme had considered additional shooting on a soundstage made to recreate the Pantages Theater, but the band declined to do this, as they thought the lack of audience response would have hindered the energy of their performance.  Before the shooting of the movie, David Byrne implored the band to wear neutral-coloured clothing so the stage lights would not illuminate anything too distinctive.  However, drummer Chris Frantz can still be seen wearing a turquoise-coloured polo shirt.\n\nDemme also considered including more shots of the audience reacting to the performance, as is traditional in concert films. However, he discovered that filming the audience required additional lighting, which inhibited the audience's energy. This in turn made the band feel insecure and thus led to \"the worst Talking Heads performance in the history of the band's career.\" The only direct audience shots in the film occur at the very end, during \"[[Crosseyed and Painless]].\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Jonathan Demme \u2013 On Stop Making Sense (2007) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS-FHFV7IbQ  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/pS-FHFV7IbQ| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|website=YouTube |publisher=Reelblack |access-date=1 December 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered during the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] on April 24, 1984 and entered commercial release in the United States on October 19, 1984.<ref name=\"Mojo title|stopmakingsense\">{{Mojo title|stopmakingsense}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film was first released on home video, the songs \"Cities\" and \"Big Business\"/\"I Zimbra\" were restored to the performance, thus forming what was dubbed the \"special edition\" of the film.
