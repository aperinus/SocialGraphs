It dramatizes the last ten years in the life of pianist [[Liberace]] and the relationship that he had with [[Scott Thorson]]. It is based on Thorson's memoir, ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]]'' (1988).<ref name=\"earlyword\" /> [[Richard LaGravenese]] wrote the screenplay. [[Jerry Weintraub]] was the executive producer.\n\nIt premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 21, 2013, and competed for the [[Palme d'Or]].<ref name=\"Cannes2013\">{{cite web |url= http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/59652.html |title = 2013 Official Selection|date = April 18, 2013|access-date = April 18, 2013|work = Cannes}}</ref> It aired on [[HBO]] on May 26, 2013, and was given a cinematic release in the United Kingdom on June 7, 2013.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Higgins | first = Charlotte | title = Behind the Candelabra is tipped for Cannes success \u2013 but can't win Oscar | newspaper = Guardian | date = May 21, 2013 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/21/behind-the-candelabra-cannes-oscar | access-date = May 25, 2013 }}</ref> The film received critical  acclaim from television critics, including praise for the performances of [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Matt Damon]]. It marked the final onscreen acting role for [[Debbie Reynolds]] before her death in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1977, 18-year-old [[Scott Thorson]] ([[Matt Damon]]), who works as an [[Animal training|animal trainer]] for films, meets Bob Black ([[Scott Bakula]]), a Hollywood producer, in a gay bar in Los Angeles.  At Black's urging, he leaves his adopted home in search of better-paying work.  Black introduces Thorson to [[Liberace]] ([[Michael Douglas]]), who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man.  Liberace invites the two backstage and then to his luxurious home in Las Vegas.\n\nThorson observes that one of Liberace's beloved dogs has a temporary form of blindness, and with his veterinary assistant background, informs the famous pianist that he knows how to cure the condition.  After treating the dog, Thorson becomes Liberace's \"assistant\" at the performer's request. Thorson also becomes employed as Liberace's stage chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce limousine onto the stage for Liberace's grand entrances.\n\nThorson moves in with Liberace and becomes his lover.  At this point, Thorson says that he is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] because he is also attracted to women.  Liberace is sympathetic, informing him that he wanted and tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men.  He relates a story of a \"divine healing\" in which a \"messenger\" informed him that God still loved him.\n\nIt gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mold Thorson into a younger version of himself.  He asks his plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz ([[Rob Lowe]]), to transform Scott's face to more closely resemble his own and makes an unsuccessful attempt to formally adopt him.  Thorson soon turns to drugs (begun by his usage to recover from his surgery) as he becomes more angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control him as well as Liberace's obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost.\n\nBy 1982, Thorson's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James ([[Boyd Holbrook]]), creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship.  When Liberace begins visiting pornographic peep shows and suggests that they each see other people, Thorson becomes upset.\n\nScott Thorson retains an attorney to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100,000,000 in [[palimony]].  As a result, Liberace ends their formal partnership and involves himself with his most recent, and much younger, \"assistant\".  In 1984, Thorson's palimony lawsuit starts where he gives details about his romance for five years with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship.\n\nNot long thereafter, in December 1986, Thorson receives a telephone call from Liberace telling him that he is very sick with what is later revealed to be [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and that he would like Thorson to visit him again.  Thorson agrees and drives to Liberace's retreat house in Palm Springs, where he and Liberace have one last, emotional conversation. Liberace dies a few months later in February 1987.  Thorson attends Liberace's funeral, in which he imagines seeing Liberace performing one last time with his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Liberace]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Scott Thorson]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Seymour Heller]]\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Dr. Jack Startz\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Frances Liberace\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Bob Black\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Cary James\n* [[Tom Papa]] as [[Ray Arnett]]\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Mr. Y\n* [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Billy Leatherwood (based on Liberace's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Vince Cardell]])\n* [[Paul Reiser]] as Mr. Felder\n* [[David Koechner]] as Adoption Attorney\n* [[Peggy King]] as TV Vocalist (''When Liberace Winks at Me'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIajC6_XWj4|title=When Liberace Winks At Me|last=SCargoProductionsInc|date=May 6, 2013|access-date=July 30, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Liberace's rhinestone car TWC jeh.jpg|thumb|Liberace's rhinestone-studded [[Excalibur (automobile)|Excalibur]], which was used in the production]]\n\nDirector [[Steven Soderbergh]] first spoke with [[Michael Douglas]] about the idea of doing a [[Liberace]] film during the production of'' [[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000), but had trouble figuring out an angle for it that would differentiate it from a traditional biopic.<ref name=\"OAAN\">{{cite web|last=Azzopardi|first=Chris|title=Behind the 'Candelabra'|url=http://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/behind-candelabra|publisher=Out & About Nashville|access-date=June 2, 2013|date=May 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023454/http://www.outandaboutnashville.com/story/behind-candelabra|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the summer of 2008, Soderbergh contacted screenwriter [[Richard LaGravenese]] with the idea of adapting [[Scott Thorson]]'s memoir ''[[Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace]]''.<ref name=\"collider\">{{cite web |last= Radish |first= Christina |title= Richard LaGravenese Talks BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, Signing on to the Film, Input from Matt Damon and Michael Douglas & Working with Steven Soderbergh |url= https://collider.com/richard-lagravenese-behind-the-candelabra-interview/ |publisher= Collider.com |access-date = June 1, 2013 |date= May 26, 2013}}</ref> In September 2008, the project was officially announced with [[Matt Damon]] close to signing on to play Thorson and Douglas in talks to portray Liberace.<ref>{{cite web |last= Chen |first= David |title= Soderbergh To Direct \"Liberace\" Biopic, Michael Douglas To Play Lead |url= https://www.slashfilm.com/soderbergh-to-direct-liberace-biopic-michael-douglas-to-play-lead/ |publisher= [[/Film]] |access-date= June 1, 2013 |date= September 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Douglas officially signed on to play Liberace alongside Damon.<ref>{{cite news |last= Dominguez |first= Robert |title= Michael Douglas signs on to play Liberace in new biopic -
