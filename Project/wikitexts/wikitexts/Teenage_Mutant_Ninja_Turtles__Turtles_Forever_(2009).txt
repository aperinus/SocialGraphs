A crossover film featuring three different incarnations of the Ninja Turtles fighting together, it was produced in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the TMNT and serves as the series finale to the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 series]]. It is also retroactively established that various continuities of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' franchise (comic books, films, television series, etc.) comprised as a narrative multiverse, allowing future crossovers.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot too long|date=July 2022}}\nThe [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|Ninja Turtles]] and their master [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] are startled to watch a video broadcast of the Turtles fighting the [[Purple Dragons]] on TV. The Turtles set out to break into the Purple Dragons' HQ to get to the bottom of these [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]s, to discover that their \"imposters\" are actually [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|alternate versions of themselves]]. They escape together, but the 2003 Turtles find the 1987 team too difficult to control, until they summon Splinter, in whose presence the 1987-Turtles explain that they landed here after fighting the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|1987 Shredder]] and [[Krang]] over mutagen in the [[Technodrome]]. During the battle, the dimensional teleporter malfunctioned, sending them all to the 2003 dimension. Checking recent tremor reports, the Turtles find the Technodrome, only to have to battle an army of Foot-Bots led by [[Bebop and Rocksteady]].\n\nWhen the 1987-Shredder sees the two Turtle teams, he hypothesizes the possible existence of another Shredder in this dimension. After escaping the Turtles, Shredder and Krang locate Ch'rell, the Utrom Shredder, on an icy asteroid where he is banished. After Ch'rell is thawed out, he proves too insane to work with and is retained for vivisection. However, his adopted daughter [[Karai (character)|Karai]], who had been monitoring his exile, breaks into the Technodrome and frees him, declaring the Technodrome technology property of the Foot Clan.\n\nWhile tracking the Technodrome, the Turtles and Splinter are attacked by Hun and the Purple Dragons, who want their mutagen. In the course of the fight, Hun accidentally becomes exposed to the substance and turns into a mutant turtle. He wanders until coming upon the Technodrome, now under the control of The Utrom Shredder, who takes Hun back into his service.\n\nCh'rell and Karai begin upgrading the Technodrome and the Foot-Bots with Utrom science, and use their supply of mutagen to make a mutant army out of the Foot clan. Using the trans-dimensional portal, Utrom Shredder learns there are many parallel universes filled with Ninja Turtles. Hun, Bebop and Rocksteady are dispatched alongside an army of Utrom Foot-Bots to capture the Turtles, breaking into their lair and it begins crumbling, forcing the Turtles to use their own dimensional portal projector to escape into the 1987 universe. Splinter is captured by Hun to serve as bait, and Utrom Shredder decides to launch an all-out assault on the 2003 universe to lure the Turtles out of hiding.\n\nAfter a brief stint in the 1987 universe, the Turtles are able to return to the 2003 universe with anti-Technodrome gear and infiltrate the Technodrome. Captured by Utrom Shredder, the Turtles learn from him they are not the only versions in the multiverse; because any of their alternate versions would pose a hindrance to Ch'rell's plan to rule all of reality. Ch'rell intends to kill [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|the Ninja Turtles of the source dimension]], creating a [[domino effect]] that will erase every other team of Ninja Turtles in the multiverse. All eight are scanned for shared DNA and are about to be obliterated as the Technodrome vanishes to the source dimension (dubbed \"Turtle Prime\"); however, Karai has gotten doubts about her father's plan and secretly teleports the Turtles to safety, where they are joined by [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] and [[April O'Neil]]. Unfortunately, Ch'rell has already infiltrated the source dimension and is now demolishing it; this causes a chain reaction that begins to literally erase everything in the 2003 universe. Needing to upgrade their portal device, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon HQ, where Hun is waiting for them to take revenge on them. However, when he sees the world vanishing, Hun surrenders the upgrade tech just before he's erased.\n\nDespite April and Casey being erased as well, the Turtles just manage to escape the 2003 universe, and are teleported to Turtle Prime. They quickly encounter their 1984 counterparts, and after some explanation, the twelve Turtles team up to stop the destruction wrought by Utrom Shredder, joined by Splinter, Karai, '87 Shredder and Krang. During the scuffle, Ch'rell's exo-suit grows giant size and proceeds to finish off his enemies. In the midst of the fight, the exo-suit is knocked into the energy the Technodrome is firing and receives damage. Everyone tries knocking him into the beam before Rocksteady accidentally trips on and unplugs the power cable for the Technodrome's main beam cannon. Utrom Shredder seizes and begins crushing the Prime Turtles, causing Turtle Prime and all his enemies to start being erased. Even though Karai warns him that all of reality, including Ch'rell himself, will vanish, Utrom Shredder continues to crush the Prime Turtles due to being too insane to care until the 1987 turtles toss explosive throwing stars at his leg, causing him to release the Prime Turtles and thus halting Turtle Prime's demise. Bebop then plugs the Technodrome's beam back in, thus inadvertently vaporizing Ch'rell into nothingness.\n\nWith their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as Turtle Prime and the 2003 reality restore themselves. Even if Utrom Shredder is defeated, 2003 Splinter and Karai note that Ch'rell always returns no matter how he is defeated, but the 2003 characters decide they'll be there to stop him whenever he may rise again. The 1987 characters board the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the 2003 characters use the portal projector to return to theirs. The Prime Turtles decide to go get some pizza to eat, as somewhere else, in the real world, [[Peter Laird]] and [[Kevin Eastman]] put the finishing touches on the first issue of ''Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'', and go out themselves to get pizza, expressing the hope that the book will sell.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]: the leader of the 2003 Turtles.\n* [[Sam Riegel]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]]: the 2003 Turtles' genius engineer who is identified as the member who holds the team together.\n* [[Greg Abbey]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]: 2003 Leo's second-in-command who often argues with him.\n* [[Wayne Grayson]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]: the 2003 Turtles' youngest member and a source of comic relief.\n* [[Darren Dunstan]] as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]]: the 2003 Turtles' sensei and adopted father.\n* [[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]] as 1987 Leonardo: an alternate version of Leo from the 1987 cartoon universe.\n* [[Tony Salerno]] as 1987 Donatello: an alternate version of Donnie from the 1987 cartoon universe.\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as 1987 Raphael: an alternate version of Raph from the 1987 cartoon universe.\n* Johnny Castro as 1987 Michelangelo: an alternate version of Mikey from the 1987 cartoon universe.\n** Castro also voices [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady]], a mutant rhinoceros employed as a minion for 1987 Shredder.\n* [[Scott Rayow|Scottie Ray]] as [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Ch'rell/the Utrom Shredder]]: the leader of the 2003 Foot Clan.\n* Karen Neill as [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]]: Utrom Shredder's adoptive daughter and the 2003 Foot Clan's second-in-command.\n* [[Greg Carey (voice actor)|Greg Carey]] as [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Hun|Hun]]: a former ally of the Utrom Shredder and leader of the Purple Dragons, who gets transformed into a ferocious mutant turtle before rejoining the 2003 Foot Clan.\n* [[Veronica Taylor]] as [[April O'Neil]]: an ally of the 2003 Turtles and Casey's wife.\n* [[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]] as [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]]: a vigilante ally of the 2003 Turtles and 2003 April's husband.\n* Load Williams as Oroku Saki/1987 Shredder: an alternate version of Shredder from the 1987 cartoon universe.\n* Bradford Cameron as [[Krang]]: an alien ally of 1987 Shredder from Dimension X\n** Cameron also voices 1984 Michelangelo, an alternate version of Mikey from the 1984 Mirage comics universe; and [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Bebop]], a mutant warthog employed as a minion for 1987 Shredder and Rocksteady's partner.\n\nAdditionally, [[Jason Griffith]] voices 1984 Leonardo, an alternate version of Leo from the 1984 Mirage comics universe; Clay Adams voices 1984 Donatello, an alternate version of Donnie from the 1984 Mirage comics universe; [[Sean Schemmel]] voices 1984 Raphael, an alternate version of Raph from the 1984 Mirage comics universe; [[David Wills (voice actor)|David Wills]] voices both 1987 Splinter, an alternate version of Splinter from the 1987 cartoon universe, and 1984 Shredder, an alternate version of Shredder from the 1984 Mirage comics universe; [[Rebecca Soler]] voices 1987 April, an alternate version of April from the 1987 cartoon universe; and [[Peter Laird]] and [[Kevin Eastman]] make voiceover cameos as themselves.\n\n== Production ==\nNone of the original voice cast from the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 cartoon series]] reprised their roles nor was the original music from the show used in this special.

She then claims the Technodrome in the name of the 2003 Foot Clan.\n* 1987 Krang and Shredder commiserate about 2003 Shredder ruining their expensive computer equipment in the Technodrome during its renovations.\n* As part of the renovations to the Technodrome, 2003 Shredder programmed the computer to now utilize all of his extraneous superlatives when it addresses him. He also states that he is intrigued by the implications of the trans-dimensional portal.\n* 2003 Raphael calls the 1987 Turtles \"clowns\", which causes an argument that gets immediately interrupted by Splinter. Splinter then orders them to stop bickering, reminding them that they should be working together, which causes 2003 Raphael to apologize for the insult.\n* 2003 Casey and April have an extended fight sequence with some enemies who are attacking them.\n* The 1987 and 2003 Turtles argue about whose Shredder is worse, calling 2003 Shredder \"psycho-evil\" and 1987 Shredder \"decaf\".\n* 2003 Leonardo gives a more complete explanation regarding the 2003 Shredder's plan when they initially meet up with the Prime Turtles.\n* 1987 Shredder yells at Rocksteady and Bebop before the Turtles' assault on the Technodrome in Turtle Prime starts.\n* Karai warns 2003 Shredder that he is making a grave mistake as he attempts to destroy the Mirage Turtles, pointing out he will destroy himself and her in the process, which causes him to stop briefly before resuming his attempt to eliminate them, no longer caring about his or anyone else's fate.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Turtles Forever'' received mixed reviews from fans and critics.
