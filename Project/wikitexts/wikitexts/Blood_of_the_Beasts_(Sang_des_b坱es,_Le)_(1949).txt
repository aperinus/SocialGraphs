It is Franju's [[List of directorial debuts|first film]] and is narrated by Georges Hubert and Nicole Ladmiral.\n\nThe film is a special feature on [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD for Franju's ''[[Eyes Without a Face (film)|Eyes Without a Face]]'' (1960).\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFranju's film contrasts peaceful scenes of [[Historical quarters of Paris|Parisian suburbia]] with scenes from a [[slaughterhouse]]. The film documents the [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtering]] and butchering of [[horse]]s, [[cattle]], and [[sheep]]. The film is narrated without emotive language.\n\n== Production ==\nFranju states that he wasn't interested in the subject of slaughterhouses when he decided to make the film, but the location around the building was the [[Ourcq Canal]], allowing him to make a [[documentary film]]. Franju stated by using a documentary film format, he was able to use both locations as lyrical counterpoints and \"to explain it as a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] while remaining a [[surrealist]] by displacing the object in another context. In this new setting, the object rediscovers its quality as an object\".<ref name=\"DVD\">''Eyes Without a Face'' (1997; DVD, The Criterion Collection, 2004).</ref> The film marked the debut of documentary photographer [[Patrice Molinard]] who took stills during the shoot.\n\n''Blood of the Beasts'' was made as a [[black and white]] film as an [[aesthetic]]. Franju states \"If it were in colour, it'd be repulsive... the sensation people get would be physical one.\"<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''Blood of the Beasts'' had no commercial release outside of Paris.<ref name=\"Ince155\">Ince 2005, p. 155.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n* Grand Prix International du Court Sujet 1950<ref>[http://0xdb.org/0041842 Le Sang des b\u00eates (Georges Franju)] 0xdb</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*{{cite book\n | last= Ince\n | first= Kate\n | title= Georges Franju\n |publisher= [[Manchester University Press]]\n |year= 2005\n |isbn= 0-7190-6828-2\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7OsMLZjh7IC\n}}\n\n*{{cite book\n | last= Grant\n | first= Barry Keith\n | title= Documenting the Documentary: Close Readings of Documentary Film and Video\n |publisher= [[Wayne State University Press]]\n |year= 1998\n |isbn= 9780814326398\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFhiHHHJbUgC\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0041842}}\n* {{Amg movie|6151|Blood of the Beasts}}\n\n{{Georges Franju}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood Of The Beasts}}\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1940s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French short documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Georges Franju]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about animal rights]]\n[[Category:1949 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Black-and-white documentary films]]\n[[Category:1940s short documentary films]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1949 short films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joseph Kosma]]\n[[Category:1940s French films]]"}]}}}}
