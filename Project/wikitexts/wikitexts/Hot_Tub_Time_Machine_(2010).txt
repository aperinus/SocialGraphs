The film was released on March 26, 2010. It follows four men who travel back in time to 1986 via a hot tub, and must find a way to return to 2010. A sequel, ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine 2]]'', was released on February 20, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nThree estranged, depressed friends\u2014Adam Yates, a workaholic who was dumped by his girlfriend; neglected husband Nick Webber-Agnew, who works a dead-end job; and Lou Dorchen, an alcoholic slacker in his 40s\u2014reconnect in 2010 when Lou is hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning. To cheer him up, Adam and Nick arrange for Lou to join them and Adam's slacker nephew Jacob at Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, where the three enjoyed themselves in their youth. When they arrive, they find that the town is not what it used to be, with many of the stores boarded up and the hotel run down.\n\nWhile drinking in their hotel room's hot tub, the four accidentally douse the console with an energy drink. The next day, the four go skiing, and after many strange occurrences, they realize they have traveled back to 1986. Adam, Lou, and Nick have also assumed their younger bodies, although Jacob's appearance has not changed since he was not born yet, though he occasionally flickers.\n\nA cryptic repairman appears and warns them not to change anything, as it might affect history. To minimize the [[butterfly effect]], the group plans to re-enact their experiences: Adam has to break up with his girlfriend Jenny and get stabbed in the eye with a fork; Lou must pick a fight with and get beaten up by Blaine, a ski patrol bully; Nick must have sex with a groupie and perform with his band at an open microphone event. They also find Adam's sister\u2014and Jacob's mother\u2014Kelly at the resort.\n\nThe three find their tasks difficult; Lou gets punched by Blaine and loses his backpack, but realizes he must face him again later at night, so he reluctantly challenges Blaine again. Adam becomes attracted to Jenny again and loses the will to break up, but is distracted when he meets free-spirited music journalist April during a concert. Nick is concerned about cheating on his wife, even though he has not married yet at the time.\n\nJenny turns the tables on Adam when she initiates their breakup, but Adam still gets stabbed in the eye with a fork after he tries to prevent the breakup. Dejected, he wanders around the resort alone before encountering April, and they break into a home and become intimate. Meanwhile, Nick covers more upbeat music during his performance. When the repairman tells Jacob a chemical is the key to their time travel, Jacob realizes it was the energy drink they spilled.\n\nAfter the group prevents Lou falling off the rooftop, they go to Blaine's cabin to search for the drink. Lou seduces Kelly. When Jacob interrupts Lou and Kelly having sex, he suddenly vanishes. They realize that Lou is Jacob's father, and he reappears after Lou and Kelly finish conceiving him. Leaving Kelly, Lou finally beats Blaine, and the four retrieve the energy drink and return to the hot tub where they create a vortex.\n\nJacob and Nick enter the tub first, but Lou decides to stay in 1986, admitting to Adam that his carbon monoxide poisoning was a suicide attempt. Knowing the future, he intends to make investments and have a closer relationship with Jacob. Adam insists upon staying too, but Lou throws him into the vortex at the last moment.\n\nBack in 2010, Adam, Nick, and Jacob discover that Lou has changed history by founding the immensely successful [[Google|Lougle]], which affords him a luxurious lifestyle with Kelly. Adam discovers that he is happily married to April, while Nick is a successful music producer married to a loving and supportive wife. They reunite at Lou's mansion with their families, satisfied with their new lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Adam Yates\n** Jake Rose as 1986 Adam\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Lou \"Violator\" Dorchen\n** Brook Bennett as 1986 Lou\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Nick Webber-Agnew\n** Aliu Oyofo as 1986 Nick\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Jacob Yates\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Repairman\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Kelly Yates\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Phil Wedmaier\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Blaine\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as April Drennan\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Zoe\n* [[Kellee Stewart]] as Courtney Agnew\n** Odessa Rojen as 9-year-old Courtney\n* [[Lyndsy Fonseca]] as Jenny\n* [[Charlie McDermott]] as Chaz\n* [[Jessica Par\u00e9]] as Tara\n* [[William Zabka]] as Rick Steelman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSteve Pink directed the movie and Josh Heald wrote the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2008/12/10/hot-tub-time-machine-writer-comes-forward-explains-himself/ |title=''Hot Tub Time Machine'' Writer Comes Forward, Explains Himself |publisher=Cinematical |date=2008-12-10 |access-date=2009-05-30}}</ref> It was filmed primarily at the [[Vancouver Film Studios]] in [[Vancouver]] and the [[Fernie Alpine Resort]] in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[British Columbia]].<ref name=\"thr\">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chevy-chase-jumps-hot-tub-84681|title=Chevy Chase jumps in ''Hot Tub'' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2009-05-28 |access-date=2011-04-30 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez}}</ref> [[Kelvin Humenny]] served as the [[art director]] for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc50dd489|title=Kevin Humenny|work=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=April 6, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for the film and the red-band trailer appeared on July 24, 2009, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2009 and on the Internet.
