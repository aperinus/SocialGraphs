It stars [[Scott Mechlowicz]], [[Jacob Pitts]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Travis Wester]], and [[Jessica Boehrs]] (in her film debut). Mechlowicz portrays Scott \"Scotty\" Thomas, an American teenager who travels across Europe in search of his German [[pen pal]], Mieke (Boehrs). Accompanied by his friend Cooper (Pitts) and twin siblings Jenny and Jamie (Trachtenberg and Wester), Scott's quest takes him to England, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, and Italy, encountering awkward, humorous, and embarrassing situations along the way.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of [[Hudson, Ohio]], Scott \"Scotty\" Thomas is dumped by his girlfriend Fiona immediately after his high school graduation at the beginning of the film. With his best friend, Cooper Harris, Scotty attends a graduation party that evening, where the band performs [[Scotty Doesn't Know|a song]] detailing the affair Fiona was having with the band's singer. Scotty returns home drunk and angry and reads an email from his German [[pen pal]], Mieke\u2014who Scotty calls \"Mike\"\u2014expressing sympathy for Scotty and suggesting they meet in person. Cooper suggests that \"Mike\" may be a sexual predator and Scotty tells Mieke to stay away from him. Scotty's younger brother, Bert, informs him that \"Mieke\" is actually a common German feminine name. Realizing that he had mistaken her name and that he has feelings for Mieke, Scotty tries to contact her again, but finds that Mieke has blocked his email address. Scotty decides to travel to Europe with Cooper to find Mieke and apologize in-person.\n\nScotty and Cooper first arrive in [[London]], where they befriend a [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] [[Red Army (football)|football hooligan firm]], led by Mad Maynard. After a night of drinking, Scotty and Cooper wake up on a bus on their way to [[Paris]] with the hooligans. In Paris, they meet up with their classmates, Jenny and Jamie, [[fraternal twins]] who are touring Europe together. Jenny and Jamie decide to accompany Scotty and Cooper to find Mieke in [[Berlin]]. The group travels to [[Amsterdam]], where Jamie is robbed while receiving oral sex in an alley, losing everyone's money, passports, and train tickets. They attempt to hitchhike to Berlin, but due to a language misunderstanding, they end up in [[Bratislava]]. Finding a great [[exchange rate]] with the [[U.S. dollar]], the group goes to a nightclub. Drunk on [[absinthe]], Jenny and Jamie [[Incest|make out with each other]], witnessed by Scotty and Cooper, and are horrified when they realize what they are doing. The next day, a Slovak man drives them to Berlin, where they learn that Mieke has left with a summer tour group, and will be reachable in [[Rome]] for only a short time. Jamie sells his [[Leica Camera]] for plane tickets to Rome to find Mieke.\n\nIn Rome, the group heads to [[Vatican City]], where Mieke is touring before her summer at sea. Inside the Vatican, Scotty and Cooper search for Mieke and accidentally rings the bell that signals the [[Pope]] has died. Scotty appears on a balcony and spots Mieke in the cheering crowd below, who have mistaken him for the newly elected pope; all this happens while the current pope is watching everyone. The [[Swiss guard]]s realizes what is going on and detain Scotty and Cooper for their actions. However, the Manchester United football hooligans from London suddenly appears at the Vatican and tells the guards to release Scotty and Cooper. Scotty finally introduces himself to Mieke and confesses his love. Mieke is happy to see him, and they have sex in a confessional booth before she leaves on her trip. On the flight back to Ohio, Jenny and Cooper give into their urges and [[Mile high club|have sex in the plane's lavatory]], while Jamie stays in Europe after being hired by [[Arthur Frommer]].\n\nScotty moves to [[Oberlin College]] in the fall term to begin his studies. During his phone conversation with Cooper, who is dating Jenny, Cooper asks what Scotty's new roommate looks like. Mieke knocks on the door of his room, having been assigned to the same room because of another misunderstanding about her name. Scotty and Mieke embrace and get into bed together, with Cooper calling for Scott on the other end of a still-open cell phone call and the film's closing with the Absinthe Green Fairy wondering at his own lack of a sex life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Scott Mechlowicz]] as Scott \"Scotty\" Thomas: <br />A recent high school graduate who inadvertently makes the mistake of thinking his German pen pal Mieke to be a homosexual man, thanks to his limited fluency in speaking [[German language|German]].<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web |title=''Eurotrip'' Movie Production Notes |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2004/eurotrip_production_details.htm |website=Media Atlantis |publisher=[[DreamWorks Pictures]] |access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> When he finds out that Mieke is in reality an attractive woman, Scotty travels across Europe to Berlin to beg for her forgiveness.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web |last1=Foundas |first1=Scott |title=Eurotrip |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/eurotrip-1200536350/ |website=Variety |date=February 17, 2004 |access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref> Mechlowicz described Scotty as a flawed but kindhearted man, who is \"very lucky to have such a good group of friends to prop him back up\".<ref name=\"production\"/>\n* [[Jacob Pitts]] as Cooper Harris: <br />Scotty's raunchy, libidinous best friend.
