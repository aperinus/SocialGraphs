Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $70 million against a budget of $22 million, making it the [[Christian film industry|seventh-highest grossing Christian film of all time]]. It was the first Christian movie to be released under [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n== Plot ==\nJohn, the last surviving follower of [[Jesus Christ]], lives in exile as a hermit near the seaside where he tells his story of his time with Jesus. In [[Bethlehem]], Jesus is born to a [[Virgin Mary|virgin]] named [[Mary, Mother of God|Mary]] and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]. [[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] visit Jesus declare him the future King.\n\nThirty years later, an adult [[Jesus Christ]] ([[Diogo Morgado]]) travels to [[Galilee]] and begins recruiting followers, [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], his brother [[John the Apostle|John]], [[Peter the Apostle|Peter]], a fisherman, [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector and [[Mary Magdalene]]. Soon these men and women eventually become his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]].\n\nThrough his teachings and numerous miracles, Jesus builds a huge following, who begin to call him the [[Messiah]]. He also draws the attention of the [[Pharisees]], Jewish religious leaders. The Pharisees claim Jesus is blaspheming God by forgiving sins, something only God can do. Jesus responds by saying he is the son of God.\n\nJesus tells the disciples they are to travel to [[Jerusalem]] for the upcoming [[Passover]] holiday. He enters the city on the back of a donkey and is met by a huge crowd of supporters, who lay [[palm leaves]] in his path. [[Caiaphas]], the head of the Pharisees, is afraid that Jesus' presence in the city will further agitate his people, who are already in a near state of revolt against the oppressive Romans, led by [[Pontius Pilate]]. It is revealed that, earlier, Pilate had warned Caiaphas that if there were any trouble from the Jews, he would close the temple, thus cancelling Passover.\n\nUpon entering the temple, Jesus sees a group of money changers and proceeds to upend their tables. This act draws cheers from the people and scorn from the Pharisees. Later, Jesus tells a little girl that every stone of the temple will soon fall. The Pharisees take this as a plan to destroy the temple and decide Jesus must be stopped. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], one of Jesus' disciples, approaches the Pharisees. He believes Jesus is going too far and wants to help. The Pharisees give him [[30 pieces of silver]] for his assistance.\n\nThe night before Passover, Jesus tells the disciples this will be their [[Last Supper]] together and says that one of them will betray him. Later, in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Judas kisses Jesus' cheek, thereby identifying Jesus to the Pharisees and revealing Judas' betrayal. Jesus is arrested while the disciples flee the garden to save themselves.\n\nOut of fear of the temple's closure due to an open trial during Passover, Caiaphas orders an immediate trial during the late hours of night in privacy, which are violations of Jewish law, against the order of other priests. Caiaphas asks Jesus if he is the son of God, and he answers \"I am\". This is all the Pharisees need to hear, and they immediately find Jesus guilty of blasphemy.\n\nThat morning, to a growing crowd, Caiaphas announces Jesus' guilt and reveals the penalty for blasphemy is death. Judas, horrified by what he has done, throws the silver at the Pharisees and runs off; he later hangs himself. Caiaphas believes if the Pharisees killed Jesus on Passover, it would start a riot, so he turns him over to the Romans for the punishment.\n\nPilate tells Caiaphas that Jesus didn't break any Roman laws, but orders him to be lashed 40 times. Since it's Passover, Pilate says he will follow tradition and free a prisoner of the people's choosing, and if they choose Jesus, he will be set free. By this time, Mary ([[Roma Downey]]) has arrived in Jerusalem to see what is happening to her son.\n\nPilate orders the crowd to enter his courtyard to choose whether to release Jesus or [[Barabbas]], a convicted murderer. Since none of Jesus' followers are allowed into the courtyard, Caiaphas easily sways the vote so that Barabbas is set free. Pilate then asks what he should do with Jesus, and again Caiaphas sways the crowd to have him executed by way of [[crucifixion]].\n\nFearing a riot among the hostile people, Pilate orders the crucifixion, then literally washes his hands of the situation. A battered and bloodied Jesus then carries a [[cross]] to [[Golgotha]] and is nailed to it by the mocking Roman guards, who earlier had placed a [[crown of thorns]] on his head. Before the cross is put into place, Pilate orders a sign attached to it, reading: \"The King of the Jews\", much to Caiaphas' dismay.\n\nWith John, Mary and Magdalene watching in horror, Jesus hangs from the cross for several agonizing hours. After forgiving the Romans and the Pharisees who condemned him to death, he asks why God has forsaken him, and declares \"It is finished\". Accomplished, Jesus dies as the temple and earth are shaken by an earthquake. While the lamps are knocked down, the curtains in the temple where God's spirit was supposed to be present, tear apart. He is then lowered from the cross and placed into a tomb, which is sealed off with a large rock.\n\nThree days later, Magdalene goes to visit the tomb but is shocked to see the rock broken into pieces and the tomb empty. Magdalene soon sees a man by the tomb's entrance and realizes he is Jesus, [[Resurrection of Jesus|who has been resurrected]]. Magdalene goes to the disciples' hiding place and tells them the good news, but they don't believe her at first. Jesus then appears to them, and they all now believe, except [[Doubting Thomas|\"Doubting\" Thomas]]. Once Thomas touches Jesus, then he believes.\n\nForty days later, Jesus is speaking to his disciples where he tells them to travel the world and spread his message. He then ascends into Heaven, and the disciples go their separate ways.\n\nAfter finishing his story, an elderly John says that all of the disciples were eventually killed for their beliefs, except him. He has been exiled to live alone on a deserted island until he dies. Jesus then pays him a visit and tells him he will not die, but have [[Everlasting life#Religious|everlasting life]], and he will return one day.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Diogo Morgado]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n* [[Darwin Shaw]] as [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]]\n* [[Sebastian Knapp]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n* [[Amber Rose Revah]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Roma Downey]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n** [[Leila Mimmack]] as young Mary\n* Joe Coen as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Said Bey]] as [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]]\n* [[Matthew Gravelle]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* [[Paul Marc Davis]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* Joe Wredden as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Louise Delamere]] as [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]\n* [[Simon Kunz]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Adrian Schiller]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* Anas Cherin as [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]\n* [[Fraser Ayres]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Greg Hicks]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Rick Bacon as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* Sanaa Mouziane as [[Martha]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film features select scenes from the [[The Bible (TV miniseries)|miniseries]] as well as footage not aired in the telecast.<ref name=\"Son of God\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/20th-century-fox-distribute-jesus-628306 | title=20th Century Fox to Distribute Jesus Christ Movie 'Son of God' | author=Kits, Borys | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref> However, the film does not include scenes featuring [[Satan]] (played by Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni) due to claims that the actor resembled the United States President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bible-producers-cut-satan-scenes-680781 |title='Bible' Producers Cut Satan Scenes From 'Son of God' Following Obama Controversy (Video) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 17, 2014 |access-date=May 26, 2014}}</ref> The resemblance was first pointed out  by [[Glenn Beck]] ahead of that episode's premiere.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anyone else think the Devil in #TheBible Sunday on HIstory Channel looks exactly like That Guy?|url=https://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/313120671297306624|work=@glennbeck|publisher=Twitter|access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}} The film's casting director Carl Proctor, claimed that the resemblance is entirely accidental.

[...] Accompanied by a score that sounds recycled from ''[[The Fountain]]'', the most famous scenes are trotted out: \"I'll give my stone to the first man who tells me that he has never sinned\"; the loaves and fishes; the resurrection of Lazarus; the last supper. It's unlikely [[Paul Verhoeven]] will ever get to make [[Paul Verhoeven#Other activities|his historical Christ movie]], but to the extent that ''Son Of God'' has a measure of dramatic impact, it's how it illustrates the radicalism of Jesus' message and the threat it posed to the establishment.
