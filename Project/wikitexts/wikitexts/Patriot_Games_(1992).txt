The film is a [[sequel]] to the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', but with different actors in the leading roles, [[Harrison Ford]] starring as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]] and [[Anne Archer]] as his wife. [[James Earl Jones]] reprises his role as Admiral James Greer. The cast also includes [[Sean Bean]], [[Patrick Bergin]], [[Thora Birch]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[James Fox]], and [[Richard Harris]].\n\nThe film premiered in theaters in the United States on June 5, 1992, and spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, grossing $178,051,587 worldwide at the box office. The film received a mixed reception from critics, with controversies due to changes from the source material and the film's portrayal of the [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland conflict]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> During production Clancy also repeatedly voiced his displeasure with the adaptation.<ref name=\":2\" /> The following film in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|series]], ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994), also starred Ford and Archer.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst Jack Ryan now teaches history at the [[United States Naval Academy]]. In [[London, England|London]] with his physician wife, Cathy, and their young daughter Sally, Ryan witnesses and intervenes in a terrorist kidnapping attempt on Lord William Holmes, the British [[Minister of State, Northern Ireland|Minister of State for Northern Ireland]] and a cousin to the Queen. Ryan is wounded but disarms one terrorist and fatally shoots two others, then subdues Sean Miller. Among those killed is Miller's younger brother. All belong to a radical [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] splinter cell led by Kevin O'Donnell. Shortly after the incident, IRA operatives attempt and fail to assassinate O'Donnell, considering him and his followers too radical.\n\nMiller is tried and convicted. As he is being transported to [[HM Prison Albany|prison]], O'Donnell and his comrades ambush the police convoy, killing the guards and freeing Miller. Fleeing to [[North Africa]], O'Donnell plans the next attempt on Lord Holmes. Miller vows to avenge his brother's death, and O'Donnell allows him, O'Donnell's lover, Annette, and several others to travel to the US to assassinate Ryan. Meanwhile, [[Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch|British police]] have determined that an [[informant]] has been tipping off the terrorists and are surveilling a book shop owner who is an IRA operative.\n\nBack in America, Ryan is informed about Miller's escape. Soon after, he narrowly survives an assassination attempt by Miller's accomplices, while Miller simultaneously targets Cathy, causing her car to crash into a highway divider, seriously injuring Sally. Ryan's former CIA superior, Vice Admiral James Greer, asks Ryan to rejoin the agency to help capture the terrorists. While investigating, Ryan recalls glimpsing a red-headed woman during the attacks on him and Lord Holmes. Ryan approaches [[Sinn Fein]] representative Paddy O'Neil for information. O'Neil denies IRA involvement and denounces the attacks, but refuses to betray any fellow Irishmen. Ryan threatens to sabotage O'Neil's American fundraising efforts by showing images of his hospitalized daughter to the media. O'Neil eventually relents and identifies the red-haired female accomplice as an Englishwoman (Annette). Finding her will lead to Miller. Satellite analysis indicates that Miller and O'Donnell are at a terrorist training camp in [[Libya]]. The [[Special Air Service]] raid the camp, killing everyone, though Miller, O'Donnell, and their cohorts have already fled to North America to coincide with Lord Holmes's visit there.\n\nWhile Lord Holmes is at the Ryan residence to present Ryan's [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] medal, a severe thunderstorm apparently knocks out the house's power. Ryan notices the boat-house lights are still on, and he is unable to radio any [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agents or state troopers guarding the premises. He deduces the house's power was deliberately cut and fears an imminent attack. Ryan realizes that Holmes' assistant, Watkins, is the informant and forces him to reveal information. Outside, O'Donnell, Miller, and their team have killed all security personnel, then infiltrate the house. After Ryan and his Naval Academy associate, Lt. Commander Robby Jackson, eliminate several terrorists, Ryan lures O'Donnell, Miller, and Annette into pursuing him on open water in their waiting speed boats. Upon realizing it is a ruse, O'Donnell demands they return and complete their mission to abduct and ransom Holmes. Miller, crazed with revenge against Ryan, refuses, then fatally shoots O'Donnell and Annette. He leaps aboard Ryan's boat where a struggle ensues; Ryan kills Miller and jumps overboard just before the burning boat crashes into jutting rocks and explodes. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Hostage Rescue Team]] arrives, rescuing Ryan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Cathy Ryan\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as Kevin O'Donnell\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Sean Miller\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Sally Ryan\n* [[James Fox]] as Lord William Holmes\n* [[Ellen Geer]] as Rose\n* [[Samuel L.
