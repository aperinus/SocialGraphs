The film stars [[Hilary Swank]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Gina Gershon]], [[James Marsters]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]] and [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 21, 2007, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It was critically panned, with criticism being directed at Swank's performance and the writing. It was a box office success, and grossed $156.8 million worldwide against a $30 million budget. In 2019 Swank expressed interest in adapting the follow-up book into a second film.<ref>{{cite web |date=19 September 2019 |title=Ahern says Swank will return for PS I Love You sequel |website=[[RT\u00c9.ie]] |url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/0919/1076898-ahern-says-swank-will-return-for-ps-i-love-you-sequel/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=12 February 2020 |last1=McNary |first1=Dave |title=Film News Roundup: Hilary Swank's 'P.S.

They are deeply in love though they fight occasionally. One winter, Gerry dies of a [[brain tumor]], and Holly realizes how much he meant to her as well as how insignificant their arguments and differences were.\n\nDeeply distraught, Holly withdraws from her family and friends out of grief until they descend upon her on her thirtieth birthday. She doesn't want to live anymore without him. They are determined to prod the young [[widow]] to face the future and explore what her life choices should be. As they rally around Holly and help organize her apartment, a cake is delivered, and with it is a message from Gerry. It proves to be the first of several meaningful messages\u2014all ending \"P.S. I Love You\"\u2014which he had arranged to have delivered to her after his death.\n\nAs the seasons pass, each new message fills her with encouragement and sends her on a new adventure. Holly's mother is worried that Gerry's letters are keeping Holly tied to the past. With Gerry's words as her guide, Holly slowly embarks on a journey of rediscovery.\n\nGerry arranged for Holly and her friends Denise and Sharon to travel to his homeland of Ireland. They arrive at their destination, a house in the beautiful Irish countryside where they find letters from Gerry for Sharon & Denise, one asking Denise to take Holly to his favorite pub. While there, they meet William, a singer who strongly reminds Holly of her deceased husband. He asks her to stay to see him after his last song (\"[[Galway Girl (Steve Earle song)|Galway Girl]]\"), which he dedicates to her. Upon hearing it, she is overcome with emotion and walks out, because it was the song Gerry sang to her shortly after they first met.\n\nDuring the vacation, while on a fishing trip, they lose the boat's oars, leaving the three women stranded in the middle of a lake. During their wait for help, Sharon announces that she is pregnant and Denise reveals she is getting married. This news causes Holly to relapse emotionally and again withdraw into herself. They are eventually rescued by William, whom Sharon and Denise invite to stay the night because of the pouring rain.\n\nUnable to deny their feelings for each other, William and Holly kiss and have sex. They begin a conversation about her deceased husband and Holly asks William to drive her to visit her in-laws. Upon Holly revealing their names, William realizes she is the widow of his childhood best friend. Revealing this to Holly causes her to panic, but William calms her down and starts to tell stories about his and Gerry's childhood. The next day, Holly visits Gerry's parents and while there receives another letter from Gerry, reminding her of their first meeting.\n\nArriving home, Holly again withdraws from family and friends. As she continues to become more and more lost, she is inspired by Gerry after finding one of his suspender clips next to one of her shoes and realizes she has a flair for designing women's shoes; she enrolls in a class that teaches how to actually make the shoes she has designed. New found self-confidence allows her to emerge from her solitude and genuinely embrace her friends' happiness.\n\nWhile on a walk with her mother, she learns that her mother was the one whom Gerry asked to deliver his letters after his death. Her mother hands her the last letter and she takes it home where she gets a voicemail from Daniel asking her to forget everything he said{{clarify|date=July 2021}} about not wanting her. She meets him at Yankee Stadium and asks him to read the last letter from Gerry, who tells her not to turn away from new love. Daniel and Holly kiss but decide they are better off as friends.\n\nLater, Holly takes her mother on a trip to Ireland. By chance they meet William, and he expresses his wish to see her again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Holly Reilly-Kennedy\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Gerry Kennedy, Holly's husband \n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Denise Hennessey, One of Holly's best friends \n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Sharon McCarthy, One of Holly's best friends\n* [[James Marsters]] as John McCarthy, Sharon's husband and Gerry's best friend \n* [[Harry Connick Jr.]] as Daniel Connelly, Patricia's employee and Holly's new friend \n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as William Gallagher, Holly's love interest and Gerry's childhood best friend \n* [[Nellie McKay]] as Ciara Reilly, Holly's sister\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Patricia Reilly, Holly and Ciara's mother\n* Anne Kent as Rose Kennedy, Gerry's mother\n* Brian McGrath as Martin Kennedy, Gerry's father\n\n==Production==\nIn ''A Conversation with Cecilia Ahern'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, the author of the novel discusses the [[Americanization]] of her story \u2014 which was set in [[Ireland]] \u2014 for the screen and her satisfaction with the plot changes which screenwriter and director Richard LaGravenese had to make in order to fit the book into the screen.\n\nThe film was shot on locations in [[New York City]] and [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=P.S.

Yet as directed by Richard LaGravenese ... it has a curious morbid quality&nbsp;... [It] won't win any awards; it isn't the sort of work that flatters a critic's taste. It's preposterous in big and small matters&nbsp;... and there are several cringe-worthy set pieces, some involving Mr.&nbsp;Butler and a guitar. The film is not a beautiful object or a memorable cultural one, and yet it charms, however awkwardly. Ms.&nbsp;Swank's ardent sincerity and naked emotionalism dovetail nicely with Mr.&nbsp;LaGravenese's [[melodrama]]tic excesses.\"<ref>[[Manohla Dargis]].

The only good things in it are Lisa Kudrow and Swank's wardrobe. The plot is unbelievable, although a competent script could have fixed that. The direction is flabby and uninspired, the casting is wrongheaded, and the performances run the gamut from uninteresting to insufferable ... the film wants terribly to be ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' without a potter's wheel, but it just succeeds at being terrible.\"<ref>[[David Wiegand]].
