A third film was announced in December 2016, but was ultimately cancelled and replaced by a sequel miniseries, ''[[And Just Like That...]]'', on [[HBO Max]].<ref name=\"satc3\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nTaking place a few years after the events of the ''[[Sex and the City]]'' television series, Carrie is now in a committed relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and they are viewing apartments with plans to move in together. Carrie falls in love with a [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] far from their price range. Big offers to pay for it. Carrie offers to sell her own apartment, although she also fears that she would have no legal rights to their home in case they separate, as they are not married. To quell her fears, Big suggests that they marry. Charlotte hires her longtime friend, Anthony Marantino, as the [[wedding planner]].\n\nCarrie shows Anthony and Charlotte the vintage suit she plans to marry Big in, but no one except Carrie loves it. Carrie is asked by her Vogue editor Enid to do a spread for Vogue called \"The Last Single Girl\". She gets to dress up in fancy couture gowns and is gifted a gown from [[Vivienne Westwood]], which she decides to wear instead of her suit. The ensuing publicity of her engagement blows up her small wedding to a big affair, which makes Big increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nMiranda, who has settled down in [[Brooklyn]] with Steve to raise Brady together, has been so busy with work, that she has not had sex with Steve in six months. When Steve confesses he has cheated on her, Miranda is devastated and immediately leaves him. At Carrie and Big's rehearsal dinner, Steve tries to reconcile with Miranda, but she is still upset and tells Big bluntly that marriage ruins everything. On the wedding day, a stressed-out Big cannot go through with the ceremony. As a devastated Carrie flees the wedding, Big quickly realizes his mistake and catches up with Carrie, who furiously attacks him with her bouquet in the middle of a one-way street.\n\nMiranda tells Charlotte that she may have upset Big, and she wants to tell Carrie. Charlotte tells her not to, as Big has always had doubts about marriage. To console Carrie, the women take her on the honeymoon that she had booked to Mexico, where they de-stress and collect themselves. Upon returning to New York, Carrie hires an assistant, Louise, to help her manage her life. She gets her apartment back, and Louise helps her put up her website. Charlotte, who is married to Harry and has adopted a Chinese girl named Lily, learns she\u2019s pregnant. She is fearful that something might happen to her baby, but Carrie reassures her.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Carrie and Miranda have dinner, where she tells Miranda that reading the Vogue article about her and Big's engagement made her realize that she had become so consumed with the wedding that it was not about her and Big anymore; it was all about her. Miranda then confesses to Carrie about what happened at the rehearsal dinner. Carrie is furious that she had ruined her wedding. After a few days, Miranda gets Carrie to talk to her, and begs for her forgiveness; Carrie asks that she does the same for Steve. Miranda attends couples counseling with Steve and they eventually reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Samantha is now living in [[ Los Angeles]] to be close with Smith, and is shown to be lonely, with Smith constantly shooting films from morning until night. Watching her sexy neighbor Dante have sexual flings, she buys a dog, overeats and goes shopping to distract herself. Finally admitting she misses her old single life even though she loves Smith, she breaks up with him and moves back to New York. Meanwhile, Louise quits her job to move back to [[St. Louis]] and get married.\n\nLater, Charlotte encounters Big, leaving her so outraged that her water breaks. Big takes her to the hospital and waits until baby Rose is born, hoping to see Carrie. Harry tells Carrie that Big would like her to call him, having written to her frequently but never receiving a reply. Carrie soon finds in Louise's files that he has sent her many emails: letters copied from books she read him before their wedding, culminating with one of his own where he apologizes for screwing up and promises to love her forever.\n\nCarrie goes to the penthouse Big had bought for them to collect a pair of brand new [[Manolo Blahnik]] shoes that she had left there. She finds Big in the [[walk-in closet]] he had built for her. Her anger at his betrayal dissipates and she runs into his arms. After reflecting on how perfectly happy they were before talking about marriage, Big proposes to Carrie, using one of her crystal-encrusted shoes in place of a ring. They marry alone in a simple wedding in [[New York City Hall]], with Carrie wearing the simple vintage suit. Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte turn up to surprise her, having been called by Big.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n* [[Kristin Davis]] as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt]]\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n* [[Chris Noth]] as [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|John James \"Mr. Big\" Preston]]\n* [[Jennifer Hudson]] as [[List of Sex and the City characters#Louise|Louise]], Carrie's Assistant\n* [[David Eigenberg]] as [[Steve Brady]]\n* [[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]] as [[List of Sex and the City characters#Smith Jerrod|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod]]\n* [[Evan Handler]] as [[Harry Goldenblatt]]\n* [[Willie Garson]] as [[Stanford Blatch]]\n* [[Mario Cantone]] as [[List of Sex and the City characters#Anthony Marentino|Anthony Marentino]]\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Recurring characters|Magda]]\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as [[List of Sex and the City characters#Enid Frick|Enid Frick]]\n* [[Annaleigh Ashford]] as Spoiled Label Queen\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley]] ([[Cameo appearance|cameo]]) as [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']] Magazine Executive\n* Joseph Pupo as Brady Hobbes, Miranda and Steve's Son\n* Alexandra and Parker Fong as Lily Goldenblatt, Charlotte and Harry's Daughter\n* [[Gilles Marini]] as Dante\n* [[Monica Mayhem]] as Dante's Lover #1\n* [[Julie Halston]] as Bitsy Von Muffling\n* [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Baby-Voiced Girl\n* [[Ben Rindner]] as The Waiter\n* [[Bridget Everett]] as Drunk Party Girl\n* [[Veanne Cox]] as Halloween Woman #1\n* Philipp Christopher as Married Man\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n<!-- [[File:Kim Cattrall 1999.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Kim Cattrall decided to take other offers at hand, resulting in the cancellation of the immediate movie follow-up.]] -->\nAt the end of ''[[Sex and the City]]''{{'}}s run in 2004, there were indications of a film being considered following the series.
