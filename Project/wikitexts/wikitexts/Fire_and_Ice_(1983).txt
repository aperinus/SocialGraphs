The film, a collaboration between Bakshi and [[Frank Frazetta]], was distributed by [[20th Century-Fox]], which also distributed Bakshi's 1977 release ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=6 June 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/178/mode/2up |page=178}}</ref> The animated feature, based on characters co-created by Bakshi and Frazetta, was made using the process of [[Rotoscope|rotoscoping]], in which scenes were shot in live-action and then traced onto animation cels.\n\nThe screenplay was written by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]], both of whom had written ''[[Conan (comics)|Conan]]'' stories for [[Marvel Comics]]. The background painter was [[James Gurney]], the author and artist of the ''[[Dinotopia]]'' illustrated novels. Iconic American painter [[Thomas Kinkade]] also worked on the backgrounds to various scenes. [[Peter Chung]], the creator of ''[[Aeon Flux]]'', was a layout artist.\n\n== Plot ==\nFrom their citadel Icepeak, the evil queen Juliana and her son Nekron send forth a wave of glaciers; this forces humanity to retreat south towards the [[equator]]. Nekron sends a [[delegation]] to Firekeep, the [[volcano]] citadel of king Jarol, ostensibly to request the king's surrender. In truth, the ice queen has orchestrated it as a ruse so that her subhuman troops can abduct Jarol's beautiful daughter, princess Teegra. Juliana feels that Nekron should take her as a bride to produce an [[heir]].\n\nTeegra escapes her captors and comes upon a young warrior named Larn, the only survivor of a village destroyed by Nekron's glaciers. The two grow close, but they become separated when Larn is attacked by a monstrous [[giant squid]], and Nekron's subhumans recapture Teegra. She briefly escapes again, but runs into the witch Roleil and her son Otwa, who intend to use her as a bargaining chip for incurring Nekron's favor. However, the subhumans simply kill them and take Teegra to Icepeak. Nekron refuses to marry Teegra, in spite of his mother's plan, but keeps the princess as a hostage.\n\nWhile looking for Teegra, Larn encounters Darkwolf, a mysterious masked warrior who pursues a personal vendetta against Nekron and Juliana. While Darkwolf holds off Nekron's horde, Larn continues his search and comes upon Roleil's remains, which briefly reanimate and tell him how to find the princess. At the same time, Jarol sends his son, Prince Taro, to Nekron to bargain for Teegra's release. With Larn as a stowaway on their ship, Taro and his emissaries reach Icepeak. Nekron refuses to release Teegra and insults her, inciting Taro to attack him.  Using his magic, Nekron forces the prince and his delegation to kill each other.\n\nLarn infiltrates the ice fortress, but fails to retrieve Teegra and is rescued by Darkwolf. They travel to Firekeep to inform Jarol, who decides to give them time to penetrate Icepeak and rescue his daughter until the glacier crosses the border to his realm, forcing him to release the lava from the volcano to destroy the advancing ice. With some help from Jarol's [[Pterosaur|dragon hawk]] riders, they assault the fortress, but only Darkwolf manages to reach Nekron. Larn, stranded midway during the attack, finally finds and rescues Teegra from Juliana. Darkwolf slays Nekron, but Nekron's dying agony expands the glacier explosively, prompting Jarol to open the volcano's valves. The lava flow swiftly overcomes the glacier, obliterating Icepeak, Juliana, and the subhuman army.\n\nLarn and Teegra barely succeed in escaping the cataclysm. When they encounter a wounded subhuman, Larn prepares to kill him, but Teegra stops him and they embrace with a kiss. From atop a cliff, a smiling Darkwolf briefly watches the pair, then disappears.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Performance model\n!Voice actor\n|-\n|Larn\n|Randy Norton\n|William Ostrander\n|-\n|Teegra\n|Cynthia Leake\n|[[Maggie Roswell]]\n|-\n|Darkwolf\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | [[Steve Sandor]]\n|-\n|Nekron\n|Sean Hannon\n|Stephen Mendel\n|-\n|Jarol\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | [[Leo Gordon]]\n|-\n|Taro\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | William Ostrander\n|-\n|Juliana\n|Eileen O'Neill\n|[[Susan Tyrrell]]\n|-\n|Roleil\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | Elizabeth Lloyd Shaw\n|-\n|Otwa\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | Micky Morton\n|-\n|Tutor\n|Tamarah Park\n|Clare Nono\n|-\n|Monga\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | Big Yank\n|-\n|Pako\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center | Greg Wayne Elam\n|-\n|Envoy\n|{{n/a}}\n|Alan Koss\n|-\n|Defender Captain\n|{{n/a}}\n|Hans Howes\n|-\n|Subhumans\n|[[Jimmy Bridges (actor)|James Bridges]]<br>Shane Callan<br>Archie Hamilton<br>Michael Kellogg<br>Douglas Payton<br>Dale Park\n|Ray Oliver<br>[[Nathan Purdee]]<br>[[Le Tari]]\n|}\n\n== Production ==\nBy 1982, [[fantasy film]]s had proven to be considerably successful at the box office, including ''[[The Beastmaster (film)|The Beastmaster]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', and Bakshi had a desire to work with long-time friend and fantasy illustrator [[Frank Frazetta]].<ref name=\"Gibson-McDonnell-192\">{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=978-0-7893-1684-4 |pages=192; 196 |chapter=''Fire and Ice'' }}</ref> Bakshi received $1.2 million to finance ''Fire and Ice'' from some of the same investors as ''[[American Pop]]'', and [[20th Century-Fox]] agreed to distribute the film based upon the financial longevity of ''Wizards''.<ref name=\"Gibson-McDonnell-192\"/>\n\nBecause ''Fire and Ice'' was the most action-oriented story Bakshi had directed up until that point, rotoscoping was again used, and the realism of the animation and design replicated Frazetta's artwork.<ref name=\"Gibson-McDonnell-192\"/> Bakshi and Frazetta were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences, from casting sessions to the final shoot.<ref name=\"Gibson-McDonnell-192\"/> The film's crew included background artists [[James Gurney]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], layout artist [[Peter Chung]], and established Bakshi Productions artists Sparey, [[Steven E.
