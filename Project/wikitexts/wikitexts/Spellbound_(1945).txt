It follows a psychoanalyst who falls in love with the new head of the [[Vermont]] hospital in which she works, only to find that he is an imposter suffering [[dissociative amnesia]], and potentially, a murderer. The film is based on the 1927 novel ''[[The House of Dr. Edwardes]]'' by [[Hilary Saint George Saunders]] and [[John Palmer (author)|John Palmer]].\n\nFilming of ''Spellbound'' took place in the summer of 1944 in Vermont, [[Utah]], and [[Los Angeles]]. ''Spellbound'' was released theatrically in New York City on [[Halloween]] 1945, after which its U.S. release expanded on December 28, 1945. The film received favorable reviews from critics and was a major box-office success, grossing $6.4 million in the United States, and breaking ticket sales records in London. The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Constance Petersen is a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] at a [[mental hospital]] in [[Vermont]]. The hospital's director, Dr. Murchison, is forced into retirement shortly after returning from an absence due to nervous exhaustion. His replacement, Dr. Anthony Edwardes, turns out to be surprisingly young. Petersen is immediately smitten with him.\n\nThey fall in love. One day, while kissing him, Petersen notices that this Edwardes has a peculiar [[phobia]] about sets of parallel lines against a white background. She compares his signature with an autographed copy of one of his books, realizing that they do not match and he is an impostor. He confides to her that he has killed the real Edwardes and taken his place. Suffering from [[amnesia]], he does not know who he really is. Petersen believes he is an innocent man with a [[Survivor guilt|guilt complex]]. Overnight, he disappears. At the same time, it becomes public knowledge that the man is an impostor, and that the real Edwardes is missing and may have been killed.\n\nPetersen tracks him down to a [[New York City]] hotel, where he is living under the pseudonym John Brown. Despite his insistence for her to leave, she convinces him that psychoanalysis can break through his amnesia and uncover his former memories. The two travel to [[Rochester, New York]], and stay with Dr. Alexander Brulov, Petersen's former mentor.\n\nThe two doctors analyze a dream that Brown had. He is playing cards in a mysterious club when a scantily-clad woman resembling Petersen starts kissing everybody there. His card partner, an older man, is accused of cheating and threatened by the club's masked proprietor. The scene changes to the older man standing on the precipice of a sloped roof and falling off. The proprietor is found to be standing behind a chimney and dropping a wheel he held in his hands. Brown's dream concludes with him being chased down a hill by a great pair of wings.\n\nBrown's phobia of dark lines on white turns out to be based on ski tracks in the snow and the older man in his dream is the real Edwardes, who met his demise in a skiing accident. The detail of the wings makes them deduce that it must have been the Gabriel Valley ski lodge. Brown and Petersen travel there to recreate the circumstances of Edwardes' death. However, Brown fears that, if he really was Edwardes' murderer, he may impulsively kill again in the same situation.\n\nAs they go down the slope, Brown remembers details of his former life: he has a guilt complex, rooted in a childhood accident where he killed his brother by knocking him onto a spiked fence. He also recognizes the cliff where Edwardes fell off and recalls his real name: John Ballantyne. Petersen and John later meet with the police, who find Edwardes' body with Ballantyne's directions. However, the corpse has a bullet wound in his back. Ballantyne is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder.\n\nHeartbroken, Petersen returns to the hospital. Murchison, once again the director, lets slip that he knew Edwardes slightly and did not like him, contradicting his earlier statement that they had never met. This inspires Petersen to re-examine her notes of Ballantyne's dream: the masked proprietor represents Murchison and the wheel represents a revolver. Murchison therefore murdered Edwardes and left the gun on the ski slope.\n\nConfronting Murchison to prove her hunch, Petersen gets him to admit that the man in the dream likely represents himself. She presents her accusation, and Murchison replies that she got every detail right but one: he still has the revolver, and draws it on her. Deciding to phone the police, Petersen points out that while he could [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]] and get a lesser charge for Edwardes' murder, shooting her would guarantee his execution. She leaves the office, and Murchison turns the gun on himself.\n\nIn the final scene, Petersen and Ballantyne, now married, receive well-wishes from Dr. Brulov before departing on their honeymoon at Grand Central Terminal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Dr. Constance Petersen\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Dr. Anthony Edwardes / John Ballantyne\n* [[Michael Chekhov]] as Dr. Alexander \"Alex\" Brulov, a teacher of Dr. Petersen's\n* [[Leo G.

Selznick]]. Hitchcock's contract with Selznick began in March 1939, but only resulted in three films: ''Spellbound'', ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947). (''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' was sold to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] in mid-production.) Selznick had wanted Hitchcock to make a film based upon Selznick's own positive experience with [[psychoanalysis]]; Selznick, at Hitchcock's suggestion, purchased the rights to the 1927 novel ''[[The House of Dr. Edwardes]]'' by [[Hilary St. George Saunders]] and [[John Palmer (author)|John Palmer]] (who had co-written it under the pseudonym Francis Beeding), for approximately $40,000.<ref name=afi/>\n\nIn December 1943, Hitchcock and his wife, [[Alma Reville]], began working on a [[film treatment|treatment]] of the novel, and consulted prominent British psychologists and psychoanalysts so as to accurately represent the psychological elements of the story.<ref name=afi/> However, the following month, in January 1944, Hitchcock hired [[Angus MacPhail]], with whom he had collaborated on several war-related short films, to co-author the treatment.<ref name=afi/> MacPhail was ultimately given the adaptation credit, and the extent to which Reville was involved in the final product is unknown.<ref name=afi/> Following the completion of the treatment, screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]] began writing the screenplay.<ref name=afi/>\n\nBetween May and July 1944, Selznick submitted numerous drafts of Hecht's screenplay for approval from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), who objected to various words and phrases in it, including \"sex menace,\" \"frustrations,\" \"libido,\" and \"tomcat.\"<ref name=afi/> This resulted in some alterations in the screenplay, including the removal of most of a character named Mary Carmichael, a violent [[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] at Green Manors.<ref name=afi/> However, the [[suicide]] of Dr. Murchison in the screenplay\u2014which typically violated the MPAA's rules against depicting suicide\u2014was allowed to remain, as it was reasoned by Selznick that the character was clearly \"of unsound mind,\" rendering him an exception.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Casting===\nSelznick originally wanted [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], and [[Paul Lukas]] to play the roles ultimately portrayed by Peck, Bergman, and Chekhov, respectively.{{sfn|Haney|2009|p=116}}<ref name=indiewire>{{cite news|last=Lyttleton|first=Oliver|title=5 Things You May Not Know About Alfred Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'|date=31 October 2012|work=[[IndieWire]]|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/10/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-alfred-hitchcocks-spellbound-104471/|access-date=18 September 2016}}</ref>  [[Greta Garbo]] was considered for the role of Dr. Constance Petersen.<ref name=indiewire/>  Hitchcock wanted Joseph Cotten to portray Dr. Murchison.{{sfn|Millington|Freedman|1999|p=25}} Selznick also wanted [[Jennifer Jones]] to portray Dr. Petersen but Hitchcock objected.{{sfn|Green|2011|p=224}}{{sfn|Fishgall|2002|p=96}}\n\n===Filming===\nSelznick brought in his own [[therapist]], May Romm, MD, to serve as a technical advisor on the production.<ref name=lyttelton/> Dr. Romm and Hitchcock clashed frequently.<ref name=lyttelton>{{cite web|last=Lyttelton|first=Oliver|title=5 Things You May Not Know About Alfred Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'|date=October 31, 2012|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-alfred-hitchcocks-surreal-thriller-spellbound-20121031|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nFurther contention was caused by the hiring of [[surrealism|surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] to conceive certain scenes in the film's key dream sequence. However, the sequence conceived and designed by Dal\u00ed and Hitchcock, once translated to film, proved to be too lengthy and complicated for Selznick, so the vast majority of what had been filmed ultimately was edited out. Two minutes of the dream sequence appear in the final film, but according to Ingrid Bergman, the original had been twenty minutes long.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=277}} The cut footage apparently is now considered lost footage, although some production stills have survived in the Selznick archives. Eventually, Selznick hired [[William Cameron Menzies]], who had worked on ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', to oversee the set designs and direct the sequence.  Hitchcock himself had very little to do with its actual filming.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=277}}\n\nBoth Bergman and Peck were married to others at the time of production&mdash;Bergman to Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, and Peck to Greta Kukkonen&mdash;but they had a brief affair during filming.{{sfn|Haney|2009|p=122}} Their secret relationship became public knowledge when Peck confessed to Brad Darrach of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' in an interview in 1987, five years after Bergman's death. \"All I can say is that I had a fiery kinda love for her, and I think that\u2019s where I ought to stop\u2026 I was young.

The trailer for ''Spellbound''{{'}}s original theatrical release in America made a great deal of fuss over this cameo of Hitchcock's, showing the footage twice and even freeze-framing Hitchcock's brief appearance while a breathless narrator informs us that this ordinary-looking man is, in fact, Hitchcock himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n \n''Spellbound'' was shot in black and white, except for two frames of bright red at the conclusion, when Dr. Murchison's gun is fired into the camera. This detail was deleted in most 16mm and video formats but was restored for the film's DVD release and airings on [[Turner Classic Movies]].\n\nParts of the film were shot in [[Alta, Utah]] at the Alta Lodge and Wasatch Ranch.{{Sfn|D'Arc|2010|p=287}} The film's picnic sequence between Peck and Bergmans' characters was filmed at the Cooper Ranch in [[Northridge, Los Angeles]], while other sequences\u2014such as the train depot scene\u2014were filmed on the [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] lot.<ref name=afi>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24594|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Spellbound|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611195629/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24594|archive-date=June 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film features an orchestral score by [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]] that  pioneered the use of the [[theremin]], performed by [[Dr. Samuel Hoffmann]]. Selznick originally wanted [[Bernard Herrmann]], but when Herrmann became unavailable, R\u00f3zsa was hired and eventually won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his score.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=277}} Although R\u00f3zsa considered ''Spellbound'' to contain some of his best work, he said \"Alfred Hitchcock didn't like the music \u2014 said it got in the way of his direction. I haven't seen him since.\"<ref name=imdb>{{cite web |url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000067/bio |title=Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa \u2013 Biography |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date = 2009-12-21 }}</ref> During the film's protracted post-production, considerable disagreement arose about the music, exacerbated by a lack of communication between producer, director, and composer. R\u00f3zsa had scored another film, ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', before ''Spellbound'' was released and had used the theremin in that score as well. This led to allegations that he had recycled music from Selznick's film in the Paramount production. Meanwhile, Selznick's assistant tampered with the ''Spellbound'' scoring by replacing some of R\u00f3zsa's material with earlier music by [[Franz Waxman]] and [[Roy Webb]]. The tangled history of the scoring process has been explored by Jack Sullivan (''Hitchcock's Music'', 2006) and especially Nathan Platte (''Making Music in Selznick's Hollywood'', 2018), both of which qualify and sometimes contradict the early accounts of the participants.\n\nR\u00f3zsa's music achieved great popularity outside the film. Selznick's innovative use of promotional recordings for radio broadcast made the themes familiar and eventually inspired R\u00f3zsa to prepare a full-scale ''Spellbound Concerto'' for piano, theremin, and orchestra. This work became a popular staple in the movie concerto genre and has received multiple recordings.  [[Intrada Records]] made the first recording of the film's complete score with the [[Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. This album also included music not heard in the finished film.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.5373/.f | title = ''Spellbound'' | publisher = [[Intrada Records]] | access-date = October 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = Intrada Records album\n| title1   = Main Title; Foreword\n| length1  = 3:13\n| title2   = Green Manors\n| length2  = 0:51\n| title3   = First Meeting\n| length3  = 2:11\n| title4   = The Picnic\n| length4  = 2:01\n| title5   = The Awakening; Love Scene; The Dressing Gown; The Imposter \u2013 Parts 1 & 2; The Cigarette Case\n| length5  = 16:49\n| title6   = The Letter\n| length6  = 0:30\n| title7   = The Empire Hotel\n| length7  = 1:22\n| title8   = The Burned Hand \u2013 Parts 1 & 2\n| length8  = 2:29\n| title9   = The Penn Station\n| length9  = 2:44\n| title10  = Railway Carriage\n| length10 = 1:16\n| title11  = Honeymoon at Brulov's; The White Coverlet; The Razor \u2013 Parts 1 & 2; Constance Is Afraid\n| length11 = 10:03\n| title12  = Constance and Brulov \u2013 Parts 1 & 2\n| length12 = 4:15\n| title13  = Gambling Dream; Mad Proprietors Dream; Roof-Top Dreams\n| length13 = 2:37\n| title14  = Dream Interpretation \u2013 Parts 1 & 2; The Decision\n| length14 = 6:10\n| title15  = Train to Gabriel Valley\n| length15 = 1:23\n| title16  = Ski Run; Mountain Lodge\n| length16 = 5:51\n| title17  = Defeat\n| length17 = 3:15\n| title18  = Contance's Discovery\n| length18 = 2:04\n| title19  = The Revolver\n| length19 = 3:05\n| title20  = The End\n| length20 = 0:59\n| title21  = End Title \u2013 Short\n| length21 = 0:24\n}}\n\n===Production credits===\nThe production credits on the film were as follows:\n* Director \u2013 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] \n* Producer \u2013 [[David O.
