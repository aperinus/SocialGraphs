Katsu No wa Ore da|lead=yes}} or by [[Toei Animation|Toei]]'s own English title '''''Dragon Ball Z: Attack! Super Warriors''''', is a 1994 Japanese [[Anime|animated]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[martial arts film]] and the eleventh ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' feature film. It was released in [[Japan]] on July 9 at the Toei Anime Fair alongside ''[[Dr. Slump and Arale-chan: N-cha!! Excited Heart of Summer Vacation]]'' and the second ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' film. It was the third [[List of Dragon Ball films|''Dragon Ball Z'' film]] to feature the character of [[Broly]], albeit as a genetic clone.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nIn a laboratory, [[humanoid]]s emerge from tanks after having been created by the scientist Dr. Collie whose employer, Mr. Jaguar, plans to use these humanoids to expose the \"world's greatest fraud\", and laughs madly as a muscular, nude man with a tail lays dormant in another tank.\n\n[[Android 18]] harasses [[Mr. Satan]] as he has yet to pay her for purposely losing to him in the World Martial Arts Tournament final while [[Krillin]], [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], [[Goten]] and [[Marron (Dragon Ball)|Marron]] wait outside. A businessman named Men-Men arrives and speaks with Mr. Satan, telling him that Mr. Jaguar, who was Mr. Satan's rival at summer camp, has requested his presence on his island laboratory to have him fight his special fighters, and threatens to expose Mr. Satan as a [[bed wetter]] if he refuses. Mr. Satan reluctantly accepts with Android 18 accompanying them to make sure Mr. Satan keeps good on his promise for payment. Trunks and Goten stow away, hoping to find a challenging fight.\n\nOn the island, a tournament is organized to pit Jaguar's bio-warriors against Mr. Satan. Android 18, Goten and Trunks ask to take part by posing as his pupils. Goten and Trunks easily defeat the bio-warriors and they observe the excommunicated [[shaman]] from the village they encountered during their [[Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 Second Coming|fight]] with [[Broly]]. Trunks and Goten explore the lab and find a tank which appears to house Broly who is supposed to be dead. They confront the shaman who tells them that after Broly was killed, he found a sample of the Legendary Super Saiyan's blood and took it to Jaguar, who used it to have a [[cloning|clone]] created. Goten and Trunks attempt to destroy the clone but he breaks out of the tank and attacks them. The ensuing struggle causes a major leak of a dangerous bio-fluid that instantly devours matter. The Broly clone is drenched in the bio-fluid and becomes deformed. Jaguar orders ''Bio-Broly'' to kill Mr. Satan but Android 18 saves him and is subsequently defeated. Goten and Trunks battle Bio-Broly while the bio-fluid kills all of the bio-warriors, scientists, and the shaman.\n\nBio-Broly pummels Goten, Trunks, and Android 18. [[Krillin]] saves Android 18 but is also defeated. Trunks lures Bio-Broly beneath a bio-fluid tank and destroys it, showering Bio-Broly in more of the fluid which appears to damage him. They attempt to evacuate the island but Dr. Collie tells them that the bio-fluid will continue to spread until it covers the entire Earth. However, they discover that the fluid turns to stone upon contact with seawater so Goten, Trunks and Krillin each fire a ''Kamehameha'' wave at the base of the island, causing a massive wave of seawater to flood the island and turn the fluid to stone. A colossal sized Bio-Broly suddenly emerges from the sea but before he is able to attack, he too becomes solidified. Goten, Trunks, and Krillin blast him with a combined Kamehameha wave which destroys him.\n\nIn the [[afterlife|Other World]], [[Goku]] receives orders from [[King Kai]] to help stop Broly who is rampaging in [[Hell]].\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese\n!
