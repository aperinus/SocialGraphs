The film is based on the novel ''The Nanny'', by [[Dan Greenburg]].\n\nDirector [[Sam Raimi]] was originally attached to the project, before dropping out to direct ''[[Darkman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/dvd/the-guardian-1|work=Total Film|title=The Guardian (1990) Review|date=October 17, 2011|access-date=August 12, 2014|author=Harley, Kevin}}</ref> Heavily marketed as director Friedkin's first foray into the horror genre since 1973's ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', the film had a troubled production, with the script undergoing changes that continued well into the shooting process.\n\nThe film was released in the spring of 1990, and had a generally unfavorable critical reception, later making [[Roger Ebert]]'s \"most hated films\" list. A [[cable television]] version of the film was credited to [[Alan Smithee|\"Alan Von Smithee\"]], due to Friedkin's wish to disassociate himself from its release. Although a critical and commercial failure, the film later found an audience as a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://criticsword.com/review-the-guardian-1990/|work=The Critic's Word|title=Review: The Guardian|date=February 24, 2012|access-date=August 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/748112-defense-william-friedkins-guardian|title=In Defense of William Friedkin's THE GUARDIAN|date=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMolly and Allan Sheridan leave their two children in the care of a new [[nanny]], Diana Julian. Diana, who is in fact an ancient [[Hamadryad]],{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}{{Original research inline|date=October 2021}} kidnaps their infant daughter, taking her to a forest where she approaches a giant, gnarled tree, serving the child as a [[human sacrifice]] to sustain the tree's life. Diana's reflection as she stares into a pool of water transforms to that of a growling wolf.\n\nThree months later, Phil and Kate Sterling have recently relocated from [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]], where Phil has taken a lucrative advertising job. Kate becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son, Jake. The couple decide to hire a nanny to allow each of them to maintain their jobs, and interview two clients through a nanny agency: a young woman named Arlene, and a caring [[English people|English]] woman, Camilla. When Arlene dies in a bicycling accident, Camilla is swiftly hired and becomes an invaluable member of the Sterlings' household.\n\nOne afternoon while Camilla rests in a meadow with Jake, she is approached by three aggressive [[Motorcycling|bikers]] who attempt to sexually assault her. She flees to the base of the gnarled tree, which subsequently comes to life, its branches strangling and eviscerating the men. Wolves consume one of their entrails, and another is impaled by the tree's root and then bursts into flame. During a dinner party some days later, Ned, the Sterlings' neighbor who designed their home, invites Camilla on a date, which she declines. That night, Phil has a nightmare in which he has sex with Camilla. The next day, moments after Camilla leaves to go shopping, Ned stops by the house with a bouquet of flowers for her. Kate explains she just left on foot, and Ned drives after her, catching sight of her fleeing into the forest. Ned pursues her, eventually coming across her bathing in the creek. He watches as Camilla approaches the large tree, and begins to fuse with the tree bark. A pack of wolves pursue Ned, who flees back to his house. He leaves a rambling phone message for Phil and Kate. Moments later, Camilla appears, naked and ashen, on the hearth, before the wolves break into the home, eating him alive. Camilla drags his remains away.\n\nWhen checking the answering machine the following morning, Phil finds two messages: One from a stranger, Molly Sheridan, who says it is urgent she speak with him. The next is Ned's, which is incoherent, but Camilla interrupts him from finishing listening to it. Phil meets with Molly the next day. She describes the disappearance of her infant daughter, as well as the nanny Diana, whom she came to discover was a false identity. She requests that Phil arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting they are the same person. When Phil returns home, he listens to Ned's message in full, which warns him against letting Camilla back in the house. Discovering Ned is missing, Phil confronts Camilla in front of Kate, but Jake grows violently ill during the confrontation and has to be rushed to the hospital, exhibiting [[coma]]-like symptoms.\n\nJake regains consciousness in the hospital, and Camilla attempts to kidnap him, but Phil intercepts, throwing Camilla to the ground. Phil and Kate depart with Jake, and upon arriving home are confronted by a pack of wolves. Kate flees to the couple's [[Jeep]], while Phil runs toward the woods with Jake, as Camilla pursues them both, [[levitation|levitating]] through the forest, until they reach the large tree. Kate chases after them in the Jeep, eventually hitting and killing Camilla. As Phil examines Camilla's body, he notices faces of babies embossed in the tree bark.\n\nLater, a detective tells the couple no evidence of Camilla's existence can be found. Phil decides to cut down the tree with a chainsaw, but in his absence, Kate is attacked by Camilla\u2014now part-tree, part-human\u2014who has again infiltrated the house. As Phil attempts to cut the tree, the branches entangle him and begin to bleed as he inflicts damage on them. The damage concurrently impacts Camilla, who is fighting Kate. When Phil saws off a large branch, Camilla's leg severs from her body, allowing Kate to push her out a window. Simultaneously, Phil manages to fell the tree, but it combusts before landing, as Camilla's body similarly disintegrates before hitting the ground. A bloodied Phil drops the chainsaw and returns home as Kate picks up Jake. Seeing the mess in the house, Phil realizes what happened as he is reunited with his wife and son now knowing with Camilla finally died, his family is now safe.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Jenny Seagrove]] as Camilla Grandier / Diana Julian\n*[[Dwier Brown]] as Phil Sterling\n*[[Carey Lowell]] as Kate Sterling\n*[[Brad Hall]] as Ned Runcie\n*[[Miguel Ferrer]] as Ralph Hess\n*[[Natalia Nogulich]] as Molly Sheridan\n*[[Pamela Brull]] as Gail Krasno\n*[[Gary Swanson]] as Allan Sheridan\n*Jack David Walker as [[Punk subculture|Punk]] #1\n*Willy Parsons as Punk #2\n*[[Frank Noon]] as Punk #3\n*[[Theresa Randle]] as Arlene Russell\n*[[Xander Berkeley]] as Detective\n*Ray Reinhardt as Dr. Klein\n*Jacob Gelman as Scotty Sheridan\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n''The Guardian'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Clarita, California]].<ref name=\"effects\">{{cite AV media\n | people =Mungle, Matthew\n | date =\n | year =2015\n | title = Tree Woman: The Effects Of The Guardian - An Interview With Makeup Effects Artist Matthew Mungle\n | trans-title =\n | medium = Blu-ray short\n | language =English\n| publisher = [[Shout!

[[Uma Thurman]] was originally a candidate for the role prior to the script changes.<ref name=\"volk\"/> After Volk suggested using elements from the [[M.R.
