The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]] and starred [[Hugh Grant]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], and [[David Morse]].\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Guy Luthan is a New York emergency room doctor who one night comes across a strange patient: a homeless man who has a wristband from a hospital he's not familiar with, mentioning a drug he's never heard of, and with strange symptoms, including a wildly fluctuating heart rate. When the man dies, Guy attempts to follow up and find out more about the patient - only to find that the body and all records have disappeared, and he's told by his superiors to drop the case.\n\nAs he continues trying to find out what happened, Guy's personal and professional life get suddenly sidetracked. His home is ransacked and cocaine is planted near his bedside. The police arrest him and he is convicted and in the process he loses his job, his license to practice medicine and all of his friends. In desperation, he manages to get the help of some homeless men who lead him to [[mole people|their underground home]]. His ER patient who died also had lived there. Through them he's led to an organization, led by neurosurgeon Dr. Lawrence Myrick, that performs spinal experiments on the homeless people, all of whom have died thus far, in an attempt to find a cure for paralysis.\n\nMyrick attempts to sway Guy to join his team, telling him that his \"test subjects\" are heroes, and that killing one to save millions is worth the sacrifice.  Guy admits that while there is some truth in what Myrick says, Myrick's victims did not choose to give up their lives, which makes Myrick a murderer. Myrick is accidentally shot and killed by rogue FBI Agent Frank Hare.  Later, Myrick's widow hands the discs and documentation regarding the research to Guy telling him \"my husband was trying to do a good thing, but in the wrong way\".  He opens the package, views the materials and proceeds towards the neurology building where he is now working.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Dr. Guy Luthan\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Dr. Lawrence Myrick\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Jodie Trammel\n* [[David Morse]] as FBI Agent Frank Hare\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Det.

It was originally developed as a vehicle for [[Alec Baldwin]].<ref name=\"Willistein\" />\n\nThen it went to [[Simian Films]], the company of [[Hugh Grant]] and his then-girlfriend [[Elizabeth Hurley]], which had set up at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. The film marked a change of pace for Grant, being a drama. \"I was always on the lookout for one (a drama), but I wasn't saying, `I've got to do a serious role now.' It was just that that was the best script around.\"<ref name=\"Willistein\" />\n\nThe script was developed for about a year, including rewrites with involvement from [[William Goldman]]. \"We just tamed it a bit for me,\" said Grant. \"We just tweaked it.\"<ref name=\"Willistein\" />\n\nPalmer said, \"They apologized for the way they deviated from the book. Hugh Grant has turned the protagonist into a character he can live with, but the nature of the character hasn't changed. The more I think about it, the more it seems like my book.\"<ref>{{cite news |id={{ProQuest|426723651}} |last1=Strickler |first1=Jeff |title=Bottleneck at box office // The hits just keep on coming |work=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |date=July 21, 1996 |page=08.F }}</ref>\n\nFilming took place in Toronto and New York City, beginning February 1996.\n\nDirector [[Michael Apted]] found it challenging working with Grant and Hurley. \"It's not something I'd recommend, however genial the people are.... It was tricky. We had the same agendas, mercifully, so it was all right.... Producers are powerful. And actors are powerful these days. So, to have the double whammy up there, it makes your job harder. The other challenge I had was that this was the first film they (Hurley and Grant) produced. They were learning as they were doing.... I didn't know whether they were going to be dilettante producers.... They really got their hands dirty. They weren't just swanning in for the glamour bits. They were there the whole time in the trenches.\"<ref name=\"Willistein\">{{cite news |id={{ProQuest|392830140}} |last1=Willistein |first1=Paul |title=HUGH GRANT, ELIZABETH HURLEY GO TO 'EXTREME MEASURES' TO STAY TOGETHER |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1996-09-22-3099859-story.html |work=The Morning Call |date=September 22, 1996 |page=F.01 }}</ref>\n\nAdded Hurley: \"I've been on film sets for about nine years as a hired hand so it wasn't that I didn't know anything.... Yes, there are things I know now that I didn't know before. But there are things a monkey could learn to do.... I think learning to keep on top of things ... You have to, sort of, learn that as you go. I hadn't realized how fragile a film could be. I did end up being very hands-on. I ended up doing much more than I had expected to. I didn't realize how easy it was to really not make the film you set out to make.... I think having to concentrate very, very hard on every department was a shock.\"<ref name=\"Willistein\" />\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had a mixed reception from critics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 4, 1996|url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294427,00.html|access-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Extreme Measures|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 15, 1996|url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911083?refcatid=31|access-date=December 13, 2010|first=Leonard|last=Klady}}</ref> It currently holds a 56% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.
