The film is the third installment of the [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'' film series]], following ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' (2008), and was the first film in the series to be released in 3D. It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]], [[Conrad Vernon]], and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] from a screenplay by Darnell and [[Noah Baumbach]], and features [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Andy Richter]], and McGrath reprising their [[voice acting]] roles from the previous installments, alongside new cast members [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Frances McDormand]]. In the film, the main characters\u2014a party of animals from the [[Central Park Zoo]] whose adventures have already taken them to Madagascar and Africa\u2014attempt to return to New York, and find themselves traveling across Europe with a [[circus]] while being pursued by a relentless [[Animal control service|Animal Control]] officer.\n\n''Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted'' premiered at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 8, 2012. It was the [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2012]] and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, with a worldwide gross of over $746 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> A spin-off titled ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'' was released in 2014. A sequel, ''Madagascar 4'', was initially planned for a 2018 theatrical release, but was removed from the release schedule following a restructuring of DreamWorks Animation in 2015.<ref name=\"BOMNewDates2017-01-27\" /><ref name=DeadlineCut500 />\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events of [[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|the previous film]], the [[penguin]]s and the [[chimpanzee]]s leave [[Africa]] for [[Monte Carlo]] in their modified airplane. When they do not return, Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, King Julien, Maurice and Mort decide that they should go find them and return to their home at the [[Central Park Zoo]] in [[New York City]]. They find the penguins and chimpanzees at the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. Chaos ensues, and the animals barely escape from Chantel DuBois, a merciless French [[Animal Control]] officer who is determined to add Alex's head to her [[taxidermy]] collection.\n\nWhen their plane crashes in [[France]], the animals board a departing [[circus train]]. The circus animals\u2014a [[sea lion]] named Stefano, a [[jaguar]] named Gia, and a [[tiger]] named Vitaly\u2014are suspicious of outsiders, so Alex lies about them being American circus animals. The circus is headed for a performance in [[Rome]], followed by one in [[London]] where they hope to impress an American promoter in order to get their first American tour. To allay suspicion, the penguins purchase the circus from its human [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] with the fortune they gained in Monte Carlo. In Rome, Alex becomes enamored with Gia while King Julien falls in love with performing bear Sonya. DuBois pursues King Julien and Sonya, but fails to catch them and is arrested.\n\nThe performance at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome is a disaster: the animals' acts go awry and they are chased off by the angry audience, though they barely escape on the train. Stefano later explains to Alex that the circus was once famous and Vitaly was its star, skillfully jumping through ever-smaller hoops. However, a severe burn during one of Vitaly's stunts caused him to lose his passion and the entire circus suffered as a result. Alex convinces the circus animals to come up with a new and exciting all-animal act that will restore their former glory. Marty and Stefano find a new passion in [[human cannonball|being shot out of a cannon]], while Melman and Gloria become adept at [[tightrope walking|dancing together on a tightrope]]. Gia persuades Alex to teach her \"[[Trapeze]] Americano\" and the two begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, DuBois escapes from prison and resumes her pursuit before printing a document which shows a photo of Alex performing at the Central Park Zoo.\n\nIn London, Vitaly is afraid of failing again and considers ditching the show, but Alex helps him rediscover his passion for performing the impossible. At Alex's suggestion, Vitaly lubricates himself with [[hair conditioner]] instead of [[olive oil]], and succeeds in jumping through the hoop. The show is a spectacular success, and the promoter signs the circus to a contract. DuBois shows up and the penguins manage to foil her attempt to capture Alex. However, the printed document she was carrying reveals that Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria were zoo animals all along. Feeling betrayed and deceived, the circus animals eject the foursome.\n\nAfter King Julien and Sonya get into an argument, the zoo and circus animals go their separate ways but arrive in [[Central Park]] at the same time. Looking in at their old home, the zoo animals realize how much their adventures have changed them and decide that their true place is with the circus. They are then ambushed by DuBois, but before she can behead Alex, the zoo staff arrive and incorrectly believe that she is returning the missing animals. King Julien makes it back to the circus with the news and reconciles with Sonya while Gia and Vitaly convince the others that they should rescue their friends. The zoo animals awaken in their old enclosures, now surrounded by high fences. DuBois is being honored by the zoo staff, but she rejects their reward and secretly loads a poison-filled dart and takes aim at Alex. They are soon rescued by the circus animals and together they defeat DuBois. Alex and his friends permanently join the circus with Alex and King Julien starting a romantic relationship with Gia and Sonya, respectively. As retribution for causing their troubles, the penguins ship DuBois and her henchmen in crates to [[Madagascar]], reminiscent of how the animals were shipped in [[Madagascar (2005 film)|the first movie]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Ben Stiller Cannes 2012.jpg\n| width1    = 99\n| image2    = Jessica Chastain Cannes 2, 2012.jpg\n| width2    = 123\n| footer    = [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Jessica Chastain]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], where the film had its worldwide premiere.\n}}\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]] and Gia's love interest.\n*[[Chris Rock]] as Marty, a [[zebra]] and Alex's best friend.\n*[[David Schwimmer]] as Melman, a [[giraffe]], another of Alex's friends and Gloria's love interest.\n*[[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Gloria, a [[hippopotamus]], another of Alex's friends and Melman's love interest.\n*[[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]] who is the king of the lemurs in Madagascar and Sonya's love interest.\n*[[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Maurice, an [[aye-aye]] and adviser of King Julien XIII\n*[[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]] and a companion of King Julien XIII\n*[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, a [[penguin]] who is the leader of all penguins and First Policeman.\n*[[Frances McDormand]] as Captain Chantel DuBois, the leader of the Animal Control.\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Gia, an Italian [[jaguar]] and Alex's love interest.\n*[[Martin Short]] as Stefano, an Italian [[sea lion]].\n*[[Bryan Cranston]] as Vitaly, a Russian [[Siberian tiger]] and a former superstar of the travelling circus\n*[[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, a penguin and Skipper's right-hand man.\n*[[Christopher Knights]] as Private, a penguin\n*[[Frank Welker]] as Sonya, a [[Eurasian brown bear]] and King Julien's love interest.\n*[[Paz Vega]] as the Andalusian Triplets (Esmeralda, Esperanza and Ernestina)\n*[[Conrad Vernon]] as Mason, a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] and Second Policeman\n*[[Vinnie Jones]] as Freddie the Dog\n*[[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] as Jonesy the Dog\n*[[Nick Fletcher (film editor)|Nick Fletcher]] as Frankie the Dog\n*[[Eric Darnell]] as Comandante, Zoo Official and Zoo Announcer\n*Dan O'Connor as Casino Security and Mayor of New York City\n*[[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as Croupier and [[Ringmaster (circus)|Circus Master]]\n\n==Production==\nDreamWorks Animation's CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] confirmed in 2008 that there would be an additional sequel to ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' and ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]''.
