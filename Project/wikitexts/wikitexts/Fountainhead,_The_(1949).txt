Roark fights to design [[modern architecture]] despite resistance from the traditionally minded architectural establishment. Roark's complex relationships with the individuals who assist or hinder his progress allow the film to be both a romantic drama and a philosophical work. Roark represents Rand's embodiment of the human spirit, and his struggle represents the struggle between [[individualism]] and [[Collectivism and individualism|collectivism]].\n\n==Plot==\nHoward Roark is an individualistic architect who follows his own  artistic path in the face of public conformity. Ellsworth Toohey, the architecture critic for ''The Banner'' newspaper, opposes Roark's individualism and volunteers to lead a print crusade against him. Wealthy and influential publishing magnate Gail Wynand pays little attention, approving the idea and giving Toohey a free hand. Dominique Francon, a glamorous socialite who writes a ''Banner'' column, admires Roark's designs, and opposes the paper's campaign against him. She is engaged to an architect, the unimaginative Peter Keating ([[Kent Smith]]). She never has met or seen Roark, but she believes that he is doomed in a world that abhors individualism. Wynand falls in love with Francon and exposes Keating as an opportunist.\n\nRoark is unable to find a client willing to build according to his vision. He walks away from opportunities that involve any compromise of his standards. Broke, he takes a job as a day laborer in a [[quarry]] that belongs to Francon's father and is near the Francon summer home. The vacationing Francon visits the quarry on a whim and spots Roark, and they share a mutual attraction. Francon contrives to have Roark repair some white marble in her bedroom. Roark mocks her pretense, and after the first visit, he sends another worker to complete the repair. Francon is enraged and returns to the quarry on horseback. She finds Roark walking from the site. He again mocks her, and she strikes him across the face with her horsewhip. He later appears in her open bedroom, forcefully embracing and kissing her passionately. In his room, Roark finds a letter offering him a new building project. He immediately packs up and leaves. Francon later goes to the quarry and learns that Roark has quit. She does not know that he is Howard Roark, the brilliant architect whom she had once championed in print.\n\nWynand offers to marry Francon, though she is not in love with him. Francon demurs and soon learns Roark's true identity when she is introduced to him at a party opening the Enright House, a new building that Roark has designed. Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture, saving himself from public rejection. Roark rejects her fears and says that they will face many years apart until she alters her thinking. Francon finds Wynand and accepts his marriage proposal. Wynand agrees and commissions Roark to build him a lavish but secluded country home. Wynand and Roark become friends, which drives Francon to jealousy.\n\nKeating, employed to create an enormous housing project, requests Roark's help. Roark agrees, demanding that Keating must build it exactly as designed in exchange for permitting Keating to take all of the credit. With prodding from the envious Toohey, the firm backing the project alters the Roark design presented by Keating into a gingerbread monstrosity. Roark, with Francon's help, rigs explosives to destroy the buildings and is arrested at the site. Toohey pressures Keating into privately confessing that Roark had designed the project. Roark goes on trial and is painted as a public enemy by every newspaper apart from ''The Banner'', in which Wynand now publicly campaigns on Roark's behalf. However, Toohey has permeated ''The Banner'' with men loyal to him. He has them quit and uses his clout to keep others out. He leads a campaign against ''The Banner''{{'}}s new policy that all but kills the newspaper. Faced with losing, Wynand saves ''The Banner'' by bringing back Toohey's gang, joining the rest in publicly condemning Roark.\n\nCalling no witnesses, Roark addresses the court on his own behalf. He makes a long and eloquent speech defending his right to offer his own work on his own terms. He is found innocent of the charges against him. A guilt-stricken Wynand summons the architect and coldly presents him with a contract to design the Wynand Building, destined to become [[List of tallest buildings and structures|the greatest structure of all time]], with complete freedom to build it however Roark sees fit. As soon as Roark leaves, Wynand pulls out a pistol and kills himself.\n\nMonths later, Francon enters the construction site of the Wynand Building and identifies herself as Mrs. Roark. She rises in the open construction elevator, looking upward toward the figure of her husband. Roark stands triumphant, his arms akimbo, near the edge of the tall skyscraper as the crosswinds buffet him atop his magnificent, one-of-a-kind creation.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Howard Roark\n* [[Patricia Neal]] as Dominique Francon\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Gail Wynand\n* [[Kent Smith]] as Peter Keating\n* [[Robert Douglas (actor)|Robert Douglas]] as Ellsworth M.

Rand's screenplay criticized the Hollywood film industry and its self-imposed mandate to \"give the public what it wants\". Roark, in his architecture, refuses to give in to this demand \"by the public\". He refuses to work in any way that compromises his integrity and in which he would succumb to \"popular taste\".<ref name=Hoberman-98/> In a similar vein, Rand wrote a new scene for the film in which Roark is rejected as architect for the Civic Opera Company of New York, an allusion to [[Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and the Civic Light Opera Company of [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Toker |first=Franklin |title=Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd Wright, E.J.

Therefore, the style is rooted in German, rather than American, modernism. During filming, Rand told Gerald Loeb that she disliked the style, which she felt had resulted from Carrere's lack of experience as a practicing architect. She described his designs as copied from pictures of \"horrible modernistic buildings\" and judged them as \"embarrassingly bad\".<ref name=Johnson132/> The film's closing image, depicting Roark standing atop his \"tallest structure in the world\", arguably evokes [[futurism]].<ref name=Collin-26/>\n\n===Music score===\nThe film's score was composed by [[Max Steiner]].
