This was the sixth and final time Ritt directed Newman; they had previously worked together on ''[[The Long Hot Summer]]'', ''[[Paris Blues]]'', ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]'', ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'', and ''[[The Outrage]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:David Canary 1967.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Canary]] as Lamar Dean in ''Hombre'']]\nIn late 19th-century Arizona an [[Apache]]-raised white man, John Russell, faces prejudice in the white world after he returns for his inheritance (a gold watch and a boarding house) on his father's death.  Deciding to sell the house to buy a herd of horses, which does not endear him to the boarders who live there or to the caretaker, Jessie, Russell ends up riding a stagecoach with Jessie and unhappily married boarders Doris and Billy Lee Blake leaving town.\n\nThree others ride with them: [[Indian agent]] Professor Alexander Favor, his aristocratic wife Audra, and the crude Cicero Grimes.  On discovering that John Russell is of Apache background, Professor Favor requests that Russell ride up top with driver Henry Mendez. The stagecoach is robbed by a gang led by Grimes, who knew that Dr Favor had been carrying money that he stole from the very Apaches with whom Russell grew up.  Grimes rides off, taking Mrs Favor as a hostage. Russell pulls out his hidden Winchester rifle and shoots two of the outlaws\u2014one of whom is Jessie's former lover, sheriff-gone-bad Frank\u2014who have the stolen money in their saddle bags. He insists that Dr Favor give the recovered money to him. His fellow passengers now appeal to Russell to lead them to safety. After Russell scouts ahead, Dr Favor disarms Mendez.  Russell returns as Favor is about to leave with the money and supplies; Russell banishes him from the group.\n\nRussell's instincts to protect the group clash with their morality and desire to save the Favors, especially when Grimes and his remaining gang offer to trade Mrs Favor for the money. Their pity for her life eventually outweighs the knowledge that Grimes is using her to bait a trap, and Jessie talks Russell into saving Mrs Favor. He gives the money to Billy Lee and asks him to take it back to the Indians from whom it was stolen.  Russell descends from the group's hideout with saddle bags that he pretends are full of the money, while Billy Lee stays in the hideout and aims a rifle at the Mexican outlaw who is at Russell's back. Russell cuts Mrs Favor loose, and she slowly and painfully makes her way up to the group, but by the time Russell throws the saddle bags to Grimes she has collapsed at a point where she is obscuring Billy Lee's target. In the ensuing firefight, although Russell is able to kill Grimes, he dies in a gunfire exchange with the Mexican outlaw, who is mortally wounded. As his last words, the Mexican outlaw says, \"I would like at least to know his name\". Mendez replies, \"He was called John Russell\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Newman]] as John Russell \n* [[Fredric March]] as Reverend Alex Favor\n* [[Richard Boone]] as Cicero Grimes\n* [[Diane Cilento]] as Jessie Brown\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Frank Braden\n* [[Barbara Rush]] as Audra Favor\n* Peter Lazer as Billy Lee Blake\n* [[Maggie Blye|Margaret Blye]] as Doris Blake\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Henry Mendez\n* Skip Ward as Steve Early\n* [[Frank Silvera]] as Mexican Bandit\n* [[David Canary]] as Lamar Dean\n* [[Val Avery]] as Delgado\n* [[Larry Ward (actor)|Larry Ward]] as Soldier\n\n==Background==\n''Hombre'' is one of several films in the 1960s portraying the situation of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in a different way from how they had previously been seen in Westerns. Management of  Indians who did their share of pioneer killing (witting or unwitting), and their perception of exploitation, are somewhat depicted.\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was filmed on location in the [[Coronado National Forest]] in Arizona, at the [[Helvetia Mine]] in [[Pima County, Arizona]], at [[Old Tucson]], Arizona, and at the Bell Ranch in [[Santa Susana, California]]. Stage station scenes were filmed at [[Jean Dry Lake]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $6.5 million in rentals in North America, making it one of the biggest hits of the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Big Rental Films of 1967 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=January 3, 1968 |page=25 |url=https://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-01-03-1968-25 |access-date=July 17, 2018}} Please note these figures refer to [[Gross rental|rentals accruing to the distributors]].</ref>\n\nAccording to Fox records, the film needed to earn $9,600,000 in rentals to break even and made $9,910,000, meaning it made a profit.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv/page/326 326]|title=The Fox that got away : the last days of the Zanuck dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox|url=https://archive.org/details/foxthatgotawayt00silv|url-access=registration|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M|year=1988|publisher=L. Stuart}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reaction===\nMost reviews of the film are positive.  Critics praise the performance of Newman and the writing of Elmore Leonard.  Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], in a 1967 review, notes, \"The performances are uniformly excellent. Three particularly pleasing ones, however, were from Diane Cilento, the boarding-house operator who talks Hombre into his ethical heroics; Richard Boone as the villainous Cicero Grimes, and [[Martin Balsam]], as the good Mexican. Ritt directs with a steady hand, and the dialog by [[Irving Ravetch]] and Harriet Frank bears listening to. It's intelligent, and has a certain grace, as well. Last year, [[Richard Brooks]]' ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'' was the best-directed film out of Hollywood, and this year it looks as if the honors may rest with Martin Ritt and ''Hombre''.\" Ebert gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four possible stars in his review.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hombre-1967 |title=Hombre |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |access-date=August 3, 2009 |archive-date=October 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007214639/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hombre-1967 |url-status=live |date=April 21, 1967 |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |work=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\n''Hombre'' holds a 93% approval rating on the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 14 reviews with an average rating of 8.1/10.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hombre/ |title = Hombre (1967) |access-date = July 17, 2018 |publisher = [[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n*[[List of American films of 1967]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0061770|Hombre}}\n* {{TCMDb title|78238}}\n* {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/03/22/archives/screen-an-able-hombre-western-recipe-served-skillfully-at-astor.html |title=Screen: An Able 'Hombre'; Western Recipe Served Skillfully at Astor (Review) |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 22, 1967 |page=41}}\n\n{{Elmore Leonard}}\n{{Martin Ritt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Martin Ritt]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Elmore Leonard]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Rose]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Revisionist Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
