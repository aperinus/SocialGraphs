A flashback reveals Sh\u014dya as a sixth-grade student in elementary school, during which a new student named Sh\u014dko Nishimiya joins the class, who is deaf. She tries to integrate with the class but ends up being an easy target for Sh\u014dya and his friends to bully. When word of the bullying reaches the principal, Sh\u014dya is singled out as the culprit by his teacher and friends resulting in the class's bullying becoming directed toward him. Sh\u014dya blames Sh\u014dko, and the two get into a physical altercation. Sh\u014dko is subsequently transferred to another school, and Sh\u014dya keeps a notebook Sh\u014dko had left behind.\n\nFor his reputation as a bully, Sh\u014dya is outcast throughout middle school. Now in high school, Sh\u014dya is a depressed loner who is unable to look others in the eyes and envisions an \"X\" mark on people's faces. To wrap up his loose ends, Sh\u014dya goes to return Sh\u014dko's notebook at the [[sign language]] center and apologize, but panics and asks to be friends instead. Sh\u014dko accepts his offer, leading Sh\u014dya to endeavor to make up for his bullying of Sh\u014dko. Tomohiro Nagatsuka, another loner, also befriends Sh\u014dya after he protects him from a bully.\n\nOne day, Sh\u014dya accidentally drops the notebook into a river, and he jumps in to retrieve it, which is prohibited. Yuzuru, Sh\u014dko's younger sister, takes a photo of Sh\u014dya jumping in and posts it online to get revenge on him, eventually leading to Sh\u014dya getting suspended. Sh\u014dya finds Yuzuru, who ran away from home, and brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Sh\u014dya follows, and the two make up and become friends.\n\nSh\u014dya and Sh\u014dko reunite with Miyoko Sahara, a classmate from elementary school who was friendly to Sh\u014dko. Sh\u014dko later gives Sh\u014dya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing them out, Sh\u014dya mishears her.\n\nSh\u014dya invites Sh\u014dko to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki Kawai (another classmate from elementary school), and Satoshi Mashiba (Miki's friend). There, they are joined by another classmate from elementary school, Naoka Ueno (who had also bullied Sh\u014dko alongside Sh\u014dya), who drags Sh\u014dko into a Ferris wheel. Naoka voices her feelings of hatred for Sh\u014dko, blaming her for creating a rift between her and Sh\u014dya, with whom she is infatuated. Yuzuru, who had been secretly recording the encounter, shows this video to Sh\u014dya. Desperate to remain blameless for her part in bullying Sh\u014dko following the leak, Miki exposes Sh\u014dya's past to the students, who are oblivious to it. Later, she attempts to apologize to the group, but Sh\u014dya blows everyone off after Naoka remains dismissive.\n\nMeanwhile, Sh\u014dko and Yuzuru's grandmother has died peacefully. To cheer them up, Sh\u014dya takes them to the countryside and sees that Sh\u014dko blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Sh\u014dya decides to devote his entire social life to the sisters.\n\nDuring a [[Fireworks#Japan|fireworks festival]], Sh\u014dko goes home under the guise of finishing homework. Sh\u014dya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. As he arrives, he finds Sh\u014dko standing and preparing to fall from the balcony. Sh\u014dya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up but falls into the river below. He is rescued by his former best friends in elementary school but slips into a coma. Hoping to help Sh\u014dya, Sh\u014dko meets with each group member to explain her and Sh\u014dya's situations.\n\nOne night, Sh\u014dko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Sh\u014dya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge and collapses in tears. Sh\u014dya, awakening from his coma, stumbles to the bridge and finds her there. He apologizes for how he treated her, asking her to stop blaming herself, and admits that, while Sh\u014dya once considered ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Sh\u014dya then asks her to help him continue to live, to which she agrees.\n\nWhen Sh\u014dya returns to school, he is reunited with his friends and understands how much they still care for him. The friends go to the [[Cultural festival (Japan)|school festival]] together, and Sh\u014dya manages to look people in the eye again as he envisions the \"X\" marks fading away. Looking around at his family and friends he has made, Sh\u014dya tears up, knowing he has finally redeemed himself.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Shoya Ishida|\u77f3\u7530 \u5c06\u4e5f|Ishida Sh\u014dya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Irino]],<ref name=\"VAPart1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-27/a-silent-voice-anime-film-stars-miyu-irino-saori-hayami/.102548|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Stars Miyu Irino, Saori Hayami|date=May 27, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=May 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Mayu Matsuoka]] (child)<ref name=\"VAPart2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-08/a-silent-voice-anime-film-reveals-trailer-more-cast-new-visual/.104076|title=A Silent Voice Anime Film Reveals Trailer, More Cast, New Visual|date=July 8, 2016|website=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref>|[[Robbie Daymond]],<ref name=\"English Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blog.alltheanime.com/a-silent-voice-uk-home-video-release-details/|title='A Silent Voice' UK Home Video Details|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=All The Anime|access-date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> Ryan Shanahan (child)}}\n:A high school boy who bullied Sh\u014dko Nishimiya, a deaf girl, in elementary school.
