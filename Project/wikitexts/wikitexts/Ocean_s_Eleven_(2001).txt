The first installment of the ''[[Ocean's (franchise)|Ocean's]]'' franchise, it is a [[remake]] of the 1960 [[Rat Pack]] [[Ocean's 11|film of the same name]]. ''Ocean's Eleven'' features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[George Clooney]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Julia Roberts]]. The story follows friends [[List of Ocean's characters#Danny Ocean|Danny Ocean]] (Clooney) and [[List of Ocean's characters#Rusty Ryan|Rusty Ryan]] (Pitt), who plan a heist of $160 million from casino owner Terry Benedict (Garc\u00eda), the lover of Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Roberts).\n\nUpon release, the film was a success at the box office and with critics; it was the [[2001 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 2001]], with a worldwide gross of $450 million. Soderbergh directed two [[sequel]]s, ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' in 2007, which make up the ''[[Ocean's (franchise)|Ocean's Trilogy]]''. ''[[Ocean's 8]]'', a spin-off with an all-female lead cast, was released in 2018.<ref>{{cite web | first=Rodrigo | last=Perez | title=Exclusive: All-Female 'Ocean's Eleven' In The Works Starring Sandra Bullock, With Gary Ross Directing | work=The Playlist | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-all-female-oceans-eleven-in-the-works-starring-sandra-bullock-with-gary-ross-directing-20151029 | date=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | first=Kevin P. | last=Sullivan | title=Sandra Bullock will lead an all-female Ocean's Eleven reboot | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=2015-10-30 | url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/30/sandra-bullock-oceans-eleven}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nFollowing his release from prison, [[List of Ocean's characters#Danny Ocean|Danny Ocean]] violates his parole by traveling to [[California]] to meet his friend and partner-in-crime [[Rusty Ryan (character)|Rusty Ryan]] to propose a heist. The two go to [[Las Vegas]] to pitch the plan to wealthy friend and former [[casino]] owner [[List of Ocean's characters#Reuben Tishkoff|Reuben Tishkoff]]. The plan consists of simultaneously robbing the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]], the [[The Mirage|Mirage]], and the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] casinos. Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, he agrees to finance the operation. The three men know that the [[Nevada Gaming Commission]] requires casinos to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets and they predict that on the night of a highly anticipated [[boxing]] match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $150 million.\n\nDanny and Rusty recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: con men Linus Caldwell, Frank Catton, and Saul Bloom, auto specialists Virgil and Turk Malloy, explosives expert Basher Tarr, electronic surveillance technician Livingston Dell, and \"The Amazing\" Yen an acrobat. Several team members carry out reconnaissance at the Bellagio to learn as much as possible about the security, the routines, the behaviors of the casino staff, and the building itself. Other members create a precise replica of the vault, which is built in order to practice maneuvering through its formidable security systems. During this planning phase, the team discovers that Danny's ex-wife, Tess, is Benedict's girlfriend. Rusty urges Danny to give up on the plan, believing Danny incapable of sound judgment while Tess is involved, but Danny refuses.\n\nOn the night of the fight, the plan is put into motion. Danny shows up at the Bellagio purposely to be seen by Benedict, who, as predicted, locks him in a storeroom with Bruiser, a bouncer. However, Bruiser is on Danny's payroll and allows him to access the vent system and join his team as they seize the vault, coincident with activities of their other team members in and around the casino. Rusty calls Benedict on a cell phone Danny dropped in Tess's coat earlier and tells him that unless he lets them have half of the money in the vault, they will blow it up; Benedict sees video footage confirming Rusty's claim. Benedict complies, having his bodyguards take the loaded duffel bags to a waiting van driven by remote control. Benedict has his men follow the van while he calls in a [[SWAT]] team to try to secure the vault. The SWAT team's arrival causes a shootout that sets off the explosives and incinerates the remaining cash. After affirming the premises otherwise secure, the SWAT team collects their gear and departs.\n\nAs Benedict arrives to examine the ruined vault himself, his men stop the van and find the bags were only loaded with flyers for prostitutes. Benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault. It is shown that Danny's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool Benedict. Furthermore, they themselves were the SWAT team and used their gear bags to take all of the money from the vault right under Benedict's nose. Benedict goes to see that Danny has seemingly been locked up in the storeroom throughout the heist and thus innocent of any involvement. As Tess watches via [[closed-circuit television]], Danny tricks Benedict into saying he would give her up in exchange for the money. Benedict, dissatisfied with Danny's plan to get back the money, orders his men to escort Danny off the premises and inform the police that he is violating his parole by being in Las Vegas. Tess leaves Benedict and exits the hotel just in time to see Danny arrested. The rest of the team bask in the victory in front of the [[Fountains of Bellagio]], silently going their separate ways one-by-one.\n\nWhen Danny is released after serving time for his parole violation, he is met by Rusty and Tess. They drive off, closely followed by Benedict's bodyguards, whose presence was noted by Rusty as he and Danny approach Rusty's car.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ocean's11Cast.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Brad Pitt]], [[George Clooney]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Andy Garcia]], [[Julia Roberts]], and [[Steven Soderbergh]] in December 2001]]\n{{main|List of Ocean's characters}}\n\n===The Eleven===\nIn order of recruitment:\n\n* [[George Clooney]] as [[List of Ocean's characters#Danny Ocean|Danny Ocean]], an ex-con who establishes a heist.\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Frank Catton, a discredited [[croupier]] and [[Confidence trick|con man]].\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Robert \"Rusty\" Ryan, Danny's friend and partner-in-crime.\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Reuben Tishkoff, a former casino owner who is Danny's wealthy friend.\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Virgil Malloy, a gifted [[mechanic]].\n* [[Scott Caan]] as Turk Malloy, a gifted mechanic and Virgil's brother.\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as Livingston Dell, an electronics and surveillance expert.\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Basher Tarr, an explosives expert.\n* [[Shaobo Qin]] as \"The Amazing\" Yen, an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]].\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as Saul Bloom, an elderly con man.\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Linus Caldwell, a [[Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] that aids Danny.\n\n===Others===\n* [[Andy Garcia]] as Terry Benedict, the owner of three casinos who is Reuben's rival.\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife and Terry's girlfriend.\n\n===Cameos===\n* Five television actors make cameos as themselves, being taught how to play [[poker]] by Rusty:\n** [[Holly Marie Combs]]\n** [[Topher Grace]]\n** [[Joshua Jackson]]\n** [[Barry Watson (actor)|Barry Watson]]\n** [[Shane West]]\n* [[Jerry Weintraub]] as Denny Shields, a high-roller gambler\n* [[Siegfried & Roy]] as themselves\n* [[Wayne Newton]] as himself\n* [[Henry Silva]] and [[Angie Dickinson]] as themselves (both appeared in the [[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|original film]])\n* [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]] and her husband [[Steve Lawrence]] as themselves\n* Boxers [[Wladimir Klitschko]] and [[Lennox Lewis]] as themselves\n* Boxing commentator [[Larry Merchant]] and sportscaster [[James Lampley]] as themselves\n* [[Steven Soderbergh]] as one of the bank robbers with Basher\n\n==Production==\nIn 1987, an attempt to remake the 1960 film was attempted by [[David Permut]], who had produced a [[Dragnet (1987 film)|film adaptation]] of the 1950s TV show ''[[Dragnet (1951 TV series)|Dragnet]]'' for the studio, but it was never materialized.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1987-08-12 |title='Ocean's Eleven' Update On Slate Of 'Dragnet' Producer Permut |page=24 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> In January 2000, Warner Bros. was moving forward with Steven Soderbergh on development of an ''Ocean's Eleven'' remake, starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts.
