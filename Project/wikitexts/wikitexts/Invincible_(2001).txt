The film stars [[Tim Roth]], [[Jouko Ahola]], [[Anna Gourari]], and [[Max Raabe]]. The film tells the story of a [[Jewish]] strongman in Germany. While basing his story on the real-life figure [[Zishe Breitbart]] (a.k.a. Siegmund Breitbart), Herzog uses the bare facts of Breitbart's life to weave fact and fiction (e.g., the story is set in 1932 Berlin, a full seven years after Breitbart's death in 1925) to create an allegory of human strength, knowing oneself with honesty and pride in one's heritage.\n\nThe film features an original score composed by German composer [[Hans Zimmer]], co-written with fellow composer [[Klaus Badelt]]. Along with films like ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' (also co-written with Zimmer) this marks one of the first projects of Badelt in the [[film industry|feature film industry]], and one of several collaborations with Herzog as well.\n\n== Plot ==\nZishe Breitbart ([[Jouko Ahola]]) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural [[Poland]]. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labour all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish [[shtetl]] home and convinces him to move to [[Berlin]], where he can find work as a strongman.\n\nHanussen (an allusion to the real-life figure [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], played by [[Tim Roth]]), an epic [[con-man]] and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a [[Northern Europe|Nordic]] helmet and calls him \"[[Sigurd|Siegfried]]\" so as to identify him with the [[Aryan]] notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely [[Nazi]] clientele, and he is a big hit.\n\nThis is a dark comedy but is equally a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin.  Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis.  Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed.\n\nA visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \"Aryan\", and calls himself a new Jewish [[Samson]]. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power.\n\nHanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of [[Hitler]]'s future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of [[Himmler]] and [[Goebbels]]. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the [[Brownshirts]]. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the [[Holocaust]] and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people of its coming. Unfortunately, no one believes him and he accidentally dies from an infected wound, according to the final titles, two days before Hitler takes power in 1933. In the final scene he is in a delirium as a result of the infection. In a dreamscape surrounded by [[Christmas Island red crab]]s, he has a vision of his younger brother Benjamin flying safely away from the looming Holocaust.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jouko Ahola]] \u2013  Zishe Breitbart.

On one end of the spectrum, [[Roger Ebert]] said it was one of the best movies of the year:\n\n<blockquote>Watching ''Invincible'' was a singular experience for me, because it reminded me of the fundamental power that the cinema had for us when we were children. The film exercises the power that fable has for the believing. Herzog has gotten outside the constraints and conventions of ordinary narrative, and addresses us where our credulity keeps its secrets.<ref name=Ebert>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/invincible-2002 \"Invincible\"], review by [[Roger Ebert]], October 4, 2002. Retrieved Feb 22, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the syndicated television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]'', Ebert's co-host [[Richard Roeper]] was also enthusiastic, calling the film, \"A tremendous piece of work.\"<ref name=RottenTomatoes/>\n\n[[David Stratton]] described it as an uninteresting and overly-long take on a fascinating period of 20th century history. However he did appreciate the production values, which were \"solid\", and the film had a \"predictably rich\" music soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stratton|first=David|authorlink=David Stratton|title=Invincible|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|volume=384|issue=6|page=28|date=24 September 2001}}</ref>\n\nAs of 24 August 2010, the film has a score of 53% on Rotten Tomatoes.<ref name=RottenTomatoes>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1110925-invincible/ \"Invincible (2002)\"], RottenTomatoes.com.
