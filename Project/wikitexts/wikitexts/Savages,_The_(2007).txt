It stars [[Laura Linney]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], and [[Philip Bosco]].\n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival|2007 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2007. It was released on November 28, 2007, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. It received critical acclaim. At the [[80th Academy Awards]], it earned two nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Linney) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (for Jenkins). At the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]], it was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]] (for Seymour Hoffman).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter drifting apart emotionally over the years, two single siblings\u2014Jon and Wendy, the younger of the two\u2014band together to care for their estranged, elderly father, Lenny, who is rapidly slipping into [[dementia]]. Wendy and Jon first travel to [[Sun City, Arizona]] to attend the funeral of their father's girlfriend of 20 years.  When they arrive, they are told that their father signed a non-marriage agreement and will not have rights to any of her property.  They then move him to a nursing home in Buffalo, where Jon is a theater professor working on a book about [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Wendy, who is an aspiring, but unsuccessful, playwright, moves from New York City to help establish their father in Buffalo.\n\nNeither of the siblings is close with Lenny. It is implied that he was a physically and emotionally [[verbal abuse|abusive]] father when Jon and Wendy were growing up and they cut him out of their lives. They were also abandoned by their mother at a young age. Their [[dysfunctional family]] life appears to have left Wendy and Jon emotionally crippled and unable to sustain a relationship. She is sleeping with an unattainable married man 13 years her senior and Jon cannot commit to a Polish woman who must return to [[Krak\u00f3w]] after her visa expires.\n\nTheir visits to the nursing home and their father's eventual death allow them to reevaluate their lives and to grow emotionally. In the end, Wendy has broken up with her married lover, but has adopted his dog, which he had planned to put down. She is also seen working on the production of her play about their terrible childhood, while  Jon is leaving for a conference in Poland where it is suggested he may reconnect with the woman he had let go. The film closes with Wendy running with her lover's dog alive, running with the aid of a wheeled hip cast, suggesting a mode of flawed yet persevering life for both siblings.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Wendy Savage\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Jon Savage\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Lenny Savage\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as Larry\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Bill Lachman\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Nancy Lachman\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Roz\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as Doris Metzger\n* [[David Zayas]] as Eduardo\n* [[Gbenga Akinnagbe]] as Jimmy\n* [[Tonye Patano]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Kasia\n* [[Kristine Nielsen]] as Nurse\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nFilming took place from April to early June 2006 in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] area of New York.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 3, 2006 |title='Savages' In Buffalo |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/savages-in-buffalo/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=[[CBS News]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=McNeil |first=Harold |date=January 20, 2007 |title=Buffalo on the big screen 'The Savages,' filmed in Queen City, debuts at Sundance festival |url=https://buffalonews.com/news/buffalo-on-the-big-screen-the-savages-filmed-in-queen-city-debuts-at-sundance-festival/article_806457fe-c9a9-57db-93c4-450885e5c475.html |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=Buffalo News |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received very favorable reviews from critics.
