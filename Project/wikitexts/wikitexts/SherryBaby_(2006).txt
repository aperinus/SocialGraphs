Screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2006, the film received a [[limited release]] in the [[United States]] on September 8, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story takes place in New Jersey. Sherry Swanson ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a young woman who has recently been released from prison and is recovering from a [[heroin addiction]], is trying to rebuild her life on the outside. Above all, she wants to repair her relationship with her young daughter, but finds the challenges more daunting than she had expected.  Her daughter barely recognizes her and no longer calls her \"mommy\", the [[halfway house]] where she lives has a curfew that interferes with her ability to visit her family, and her relationship with her family has become tense and strained and she often tends to act childlike at times.\n\nIn between trips to visit her daughter and her job at a youth center, Sherry attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings in an effort to beat back her addiction to heroin.  She strikes up a relationship with Dean ([[Danny Trejo]]), a fellow addict she meets at Alcoholics Anonymous. The stresses of her damaged relationships with her family, satisfying her parole officer, and finding a way to reconnect with her daughter soon prove overwhelming.  Sherry soon starts drinking and using drugs again, putting her parole at risk.  Struggling to maintain a grip on her life, Sherry finally breaks down and admits to her brother that she knows she needs help.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Sherry Swanson\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Bobby Swanson\n* [[Sam Bottoms]] as Bob Swanson, Sr.\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Marcia Swanson\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as parole officer Hernandez\n* [[Rio Hackford]] as Andy Kelly\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Dean Walker\n* [[Michelle Hurst]] as Dorothy Washington\n* Caroline Clay as parole officer Murphy\n* Bridget Barkan as Lynette Swanson\n* [[Ryan Simpkins]] as Alexis Parks\n* Stephen Peabody as Mr. Monroe\n\n==Reception==\n''Sherrybaby'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
