It is an account of the life of [[Rudy Ruettiger|Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger]], who harbored dreams of playing [[American football|football]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]] despite significant obstacles. It was the first film that the Notre Dame administration allowed to be shot on campus since ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]'' in 1940.\n\nIn 2005, ''Rudy'' was named one of the best 25 sports movies of the previous 25 years in two polls by [[ESPN]] (#24 by a panel of sports experts, and #4 by [[ESPN.com]] users).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/bestmoviesresult |title= ESPN25: The 25 Best Sports Movies |date= June 29, 2004 |access-date=2008-05-31 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> It was ranked the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers|54th-most inspiring film of all time]] in the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI 100 Years... series|\"100 Years\" series]].<ref>[http://www.afi.com/100years/cheers.aspx \"AFI 100 years... 100 cheers\"].

Retrieved November 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 18, 1993, and was released in the United States on October 15, 1993, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. It stars [[Sean Astin]] as the title character, along with [[Ned Beatty]], [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], [[Robert Prosky]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]]. The film had supporting roles from [[Jon Favreau]] and [[Vince Vaughn]], being both actors' first film roles. The script was written by [[Angelo Pizzo]], who created ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' (1986), which was also directed by Anspaugh.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 1960s in [[Joliet, Illinois]], Daniel Eugene \"Rudy\" Ruettiger dreams of playing football at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] but lacks the grades and money to attend and the talent and physical stature to play major [[college football]]. Following high school, he works at a steel mill with his father, a Notre Dame fan, and his older brother. When his supportive best friend Pete is killed in a mill explosion, Rudy decides to follow his dream.\n\nIn 1972, Rudy visits Notre Dame but is not academically eligible to enroll. With the help of local priest and former Notre Dame president Father John Cavanaugh, Rudy enrolls at nearby [[Holy Cross College (Indiana)|Holy Cross College]], hoping to transfer. He approaches Fortune, head groundskeeper at Notre Dame Stadium, and is given a job. Homeless, Rudy sneaks into Fortune's office through a window to sleep on a cot; initially indifferent to Rudy's plight, Fortune later leaves him with blankets and a key to the office. Rudy learns that Fortune, despite working at the stadium for years, has never seen a Notre Dame football game.\n\nRudy befriends [[teaching assistant]] D-Bob, who helps him study in return for Rudy helping him socially with girls.  D-Bob tests Rudy for a learning disability; the results indicate that Rudy suffers from [[dyslexia]], which he then overcomes to become a better student. At Christmas, Rudy returns home to find that his family appreciates his college academic achievements, although his brother Frank still mocks him for his attempts to play college football. Rudy persists, and even losing his girlfriend to his older brother Johnny does not deter him.\n\nAfter two years at Holy Cross and three rejections from Notre Dame, Rudy is finally admitted and attends football tryouts in the hope of making the team as a [[Walk-on (sports)|\"walk-on.\"]] Assistant coach Yonto warns the walk-ons that 35 scholarship players will not even make the \"dress roster\" of players who take the field during games, but notices Rudy's determination and gives him a spot on the daily practice squad. Rudy tells Fortune and persuades him to promise to see his first game.\n\nPlaying well, Rudy convinces head coach [[Ara Parseghian]] to let him suit up for one home game in his senior year, but Parseghian retires following the [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974 season]] and is replaced by former [[National Football League|NFL]] coach [[Dan Devine]], who refuses to place Rudy on the game-day roster. Frustrated to not be on the dress list for the next-to-last home game, Rudy quits the team.\n\nFortune finds a distraught Rudy and reveals he had actually played for Notre Dame years earlier, but quit as he felt his skin color kept him from playing and has regretted it ever since. Reminded that he has nothing to prove to anyone but himself and will forever regret quitting, Rudy returns to the team. Each of his fellow seniors, led by [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] and [[All-America]]n Roland Steele, lines up to lay his jersey on Devine's desk, requesting Rudy be allowed to dress in his place for the season's final game. Devine lets Rudy suit up against [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].\n\nWith Rudy's family and D-Bob in attendance, Steele invites Rudy to lead the team onto the field, and Fortune is there to see the game as promised. With Notre Dame leading 17\u20133 in the fourth quarter, Devine sends all the seniors into the game except Rudy, despite Steele's and the assistant coaches' urging. Fans are aware of Rudy's goal from a story in the student newspaper, and a \"Rudy!\" chant begins in the stadium. Hearing this, the Notre Dame offense, led by [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] Jamie O'Hara, overrules Devine's call for [[Quarterback kneel|victory formation]] and scores a quick touchdown, providing defensive player Rudy a chance to get in the game and be entered onto the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]] roster. Devine finally lets Rudy play on the Notre Dame kickoff to Georgia Tech. Rudy stays in for the final play, sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, and is carried off the field on his teammates' shoulders to cheers from the stadium.\n\nAn epilogue states that since 1975, no other player for Notre Dame had been carried off the field as of the time of the film's release in 1993.{{refn|name=Update|group=N|In 1995, fullback [[Marc Edwards (American football)|Marc Edwards]] became the second Notre Dame player carried off the field by his teammates following their upset win over the [[University of Southern California Trojans football|USC Trojans]].}} Rudy graduated in 1976 and five of his younger brothers went on to earn college degrees.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sean Astin]] as [[Daniel Ruettiger|Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger]]\n*[[Jon Favreau]] as Dennis \"D-Bob\" McGowan\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as Daniel Ruettiger, Sr.\n*[[Charles S.
