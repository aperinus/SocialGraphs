Macy]]. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival|1999 Sundance Film Festival]] and was acquired by [[Miramax]]. It had a limited release in North American theaters on October 1, 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nThree prisoners escape from a [[chain gang]], and two of them, Wayne and Harry, steal an RV. They discover that the RV actually belongs to two [[Homosexuality|gay]] men who travel around Texas as consultants for [[Beauty pageant|beauty pageants]]. They are apprehended by Chappy Dent, the sheriff of [[Happy, Texas]], who mistakes the escapees for the pageant organizers. Posing as the organizers, Wayne and Harry proceed to help out with the pageant while hiding from the law and waiting for an opportunity to rob the local bank. \n\nThe duo's scheme is complicated by the fact that Chappy himself is gay and is attracted to the prisoner Harry. Straight Harry, on the other hand, becomes attracted to Josephine, the president of the bank. Meanwhile, \"gay\" David, also actually straight, gets involved with the local pageant coordinator, Doreen. \n\nBy the day of the big pageant, the third escaped convict has surfaced, leading Wayne and Harry to organize a break-in during the show. Harry calls in more police, and in the process, all three are apprehended. In the last scene, the pageant group that Wayne helped train came to the prison to show them the closing number, in the costumes he made.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Steve Zahn]] as Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (David)\n*[[Jeremy Northam]] as Harry Sawyer (Steven 'Steve')\n*[[William H.
