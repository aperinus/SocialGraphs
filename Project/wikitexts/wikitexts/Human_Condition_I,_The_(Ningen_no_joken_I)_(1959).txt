''The Victim As Hero: Ideologies of Peace and National Identity in Postwar Japan'', p. 107.</ref> The films are subtitled [[The Human Condition I: No Greater Love|No Greater Love]] (1959), Road to Eternity (1959), and [[A Soldier's Prayer]] (1961).\n\nThe trilogy follows the life of Kaji, a Japanese [[pacifism|pacifist]] and [[socialism|socialist]], as he tries to survive in the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and oppressive world of [[World War II]]-era Japan.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Human Condition''  follows the journey of the well-intentioned, yet na\u00efve Kaji who transitions from being a labor camp supervisor to an Imperial Army soldier and eventually Soviet POW. Constantly trying to rise above a corrupt system, Kaji time and time again finds his morals an impediment rather than an advantage.\n\n===''No Greater Love'' (1959)===\n{{main article|No Greater Love (1959 film)}}\n\nIn [[World War II]]-era Japan, Kaji marries his sweetheart Michiko despite his misgivings about the future. To gain exemption from military service, he moves his wife to a large mining operation in [[Manchukuo|Japanese-colonized Manchuria]], where he serves as a labor chief assigned to a workforce of Chinese prisoners.\n\nKaji aggravates the camp bureaucracy by implementing humane practices to improve both labor conditions and productivity, clashing with foremen, administrators, and the [[Kenpeitai]] military police. Ultimately his efforts to grant autonomy to the POWs are undermined by scheming officials, resulting in the electrocution of several prisoners and the beheading of others accused of attempted escape. When Kaji protests the brutality, he is tortured and then drafted into the army to relieve the camp supervisors of his disruptive presence.\n\n===''Road to Eternity'' (1959)=== \nKaji, having lost his exemption from military service by protecting Chinese prisoners from unjust punishment, has now been conscripted into the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]].  Under suspicion of leftist sympathies, Kaji is assigned the toughest duties in his military recruiting class despite his excellent marksmanship and strong barracks discipline. His wife Michiko pleads for understanding in a letter to his commanding officer and later pays Kaji a highly unorthodox visit to his military facility to express her love and solidarity. Kaji considers escaping across the front with his friend Shinjo, who is similarly under suspicion due to his brother's arrest for communist activities.  Distrusting the idea that desertion will lead to freedom, and being faithful to his wife, Kaji ultimately commits to continued military service despite his hardships.\n\nWhen Obara, a poor-sighted, weak soldier in Kaji's unit, kills himself after troubles from home are compounded by ceaseless punishment and humiliation from other soldiers, Kaji demands disciplinary action from his superiors for [[Private first class|PFC]] Yoshida, the ring leader of the troops who pushed Obara over the brink. While Yoshida is not disciplined, Kaji helps to seal his fate by refusing to rescue the vicious soldier when both men are trapped in quicksand while in pursuit of Shinjo, who finally seized the opportunity to desert. Kaji is released from hospitalization related to the quicksand incident and is transported to the front with his unit.\n\nKaji is asked to lead a group of recruits and promoted to private first class. He accepts his assignment with the condition that his men will be separated from a group of veteran artillerymen, who practice intense cruelty as punishment for the slightest offenses. Often taking the punishment for his men, Kaji is personally beaten many times by these veterans, despite his relationship with Second Lieutenant Kageyama. Demoralized by the fall of Okinawa and continually battling with the veterans, Kaji and most of his men are sent on a month-long trench digging work detail. Their work is interrupted by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] army [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|onslaught]] that produces heavy Japanese casualties and the death of Kageyama. Forced to defend flat terrain with little fortification and a light armament, the Japanese troops are overrun by Soviet tanks, and untold men are killed. Kaji survives the battle but is forced to kill a maddened Japanese soldier with his bare hands to prevent Soviet soldiers from discovering his position. The film ends with Kaji uttering \"I'm a monster, but I'm going to stay alive!\" and running and screaming in desperate search of any other Japanese survivors.\n\n===''A Soldier's Prayer'' (1961)===\n{{main article|A Soldier's Prayer}}\nThe Japanese forces having been shattered during the events of the second film, Kaji and some comrades attempt to elude capture by Soviet forces and find the remnants of the Kwantung army in South Manchuria.  Following the bayonetting of a Russian soldier, however, Kaji is increasingly sick of combat and decides to abandon any pretense of rejoining the army. Instead, he leads fellow soldiers and a growing number of civilian refugees as they attempt to flee the warzone and return to their homes. Lost in a dense forest, the Japanese begin to infight, and eventually many die of hunger, poisonous mushrooms, and suicide. Emerging from the forest on their last legs, Kaji and the refugees encounter regular Japanese army troops, who deny them food as if they were deserters. Carrying on further south, Kaji and his associates find a well-stocked farmhouse that is soon ambushed by Chinese peasant fighters. A prostitute to whom Kaji had shown kindness is killed by these partisans, and Kaji vows to fight them rather than escape. However, overpowered by these newly armed Chinese forces, Kaji and his fellow soldiers are nearly killed and are forced to run through a flaming wheat field to survive. Kaji then encounters a group of fifty Japanese army holdouts who are attempting to resume combat in alliance with [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whom they believe will be supported by American forces, in a civil war against Russian-backed Communist Chinese. Kaji, a believer in pacifism and socialism, rejects this strategy as misguided and doomed to failure. Eventually, Kaji and a group of Japanese soldiers, whose number has grown to fifteen, fight through Russian patrols and find an encampment of women and old men who seek their protection. Kaji is driven to continue moving in search of his wife but decides to surrender to Soviet forces when the encampment is besieged.\n\nCaptured by the [[Red Army]] and subjected to treatment that echoes the violence meted out to the Chinese in the first film, Kaji and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Terada resist the Japanese officers who run their work camp in cooperation with Soviet forces.  While such resistance amounts to no more than picking through the Russians' garbage for scraps of food and wearing gunnysacks to protect them from increasingly colder weather, Kaji is branded a saboteur and judged by a Soviet tribunal to harsh labor. With a corrupt translator and no other means of talking to the Russian officers with whom he feels ideological sympathies, Kaji becomes increasingly disillusioned by conditions in the camp and with Communist orthodoxy. When Terada is driven to exhaustion and death by harsh treatment from the collaborating officer Kirihara, Kaji decides to kill the man and then escape the camp alone. Still dreaming of finding his wife and abused as a worthless beggar and as a \"Japanese devil\" by the Chinese peasants of whom he begs mercy, Kaji eventually succumbs to the cold and dies in the [[Eurasia|vast]] [[Continental climate|winter]] wasteland covered in snow.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ningen no j\u014dken 1.jpg|thumbnail|right|Tatsuya Nakadai and Michiyo Aratama in 1959]]\n\n===''No Greater Love''===\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Kaji\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as Michiko\n* [[Chikage Awashima]] as T\u014dfuku Kin \n* [[Ineko Arima]] as Shunran Y\u014d\n* [[S\u014d Yamamura]] as Okishima\n* [[Keiji Sada]] as Kageyama \n* [[K\u014dji Nanbara]] as Kao (as Shinji Nanbara)\n* [[Akira Ishihama]] as Chen  \n* [[K\u014dji Mitsui]] as Furuya\n* [[Seiji Miyaguchi]] as Wang Heng Li \n* [[Eitaro Ozawa]] as Okazaki \n* [[Toru Abe]] as Sergeant Watai \n* [[Junkichi Orimoto]] as Sai\n* [[Masao Mishima]] as Manager Kuroki \n* [[Ky\u016b Sazanka]] as Cho Meisan\n* [[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as [[manj\u016b]] shop proprietor\n* [[Yasushi Nagata]] as Muta\n* [[Yoshio Kosugi]] as Kawashima\n* [[Shinsuke Ashida]] as Matsuda\n* [[Toshiko Kobayashi]] as Yasuko\n* [[Taiji Tonoyama]] as Huang\n* [[Ry\u016bji Kita]] as Liu\n\n===''Road to Eternity''===\nSee also [[Ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army]].\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Kaji\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as Michiko\n* [[Keiji Sada]] as Second Lieutenant Kageyama\n* Kokinji Katsura as Private 2nd class Sasa\n* Jun Tatara as Warrant Officer Hino\n* Michir\u014d Minami as Senior Private Yoshida\n* Kei Sat\u014d as [[Private first class|PFC]] Shinj\u014d\n* [[Kunie Tanaka]] as Private 2nd class Obara\n* [[Ry\u014dhei Uchida (actor)|Ry\u014dhei Uchida]] as Sergeant Hashiya\n* [[Sh\u014dbun Inoue]] as PFC Akahoshi\n* [[Taketoshi Nait\u014d]] as PFC Tange\n* [[Y\u016bsuke Kawazu]] as Private 2nd class Terada\n* [[Susumu Fujita]] as Private 2nd class Naruto\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Corporal Onodera\n* [[Sh\u014dji Yasui]] as apprentice officer\n* [[Fumio Watanabe]] as [[Staff (military)|staff]] officer\n* [[Jun Hamamura]] as First Lieutenant Toi\n* [[Akiji Kobayashi]] as Second Lieutenant Nonaka\n* [[Hisashi Igawa]] as PFC Masui\n\n===''A Soldier's Prayer''===\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Kaji\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as Michiko\n* [[Tamao Nakamura]] as refugee girl \n* [[Y\u016bsuke Kawazu]] as Private 2nd class Terada\n* [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] as refugee elder \n* [[Taketoshi Nait\u014d]] as PFC Tange\n* [[Ky\u014dko Kishida]] as Ry\u016bko \n* Ed Keene as Russian officer\n* Ronald Self as Chapayev\n* [[Nobuo Kaneko]] as Corporal Kirihara\n* [[Kazuo Kitamura]] as Sergeant Major Kitago\n* [[Toshio Takahara]] as corporal going to Korea\n* [[Kin Sugai]] as refugee on the road\n* [[Hideko Takamine]] as a refugee\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based upon [[Junpei Gomikawa]]'s six-part autobiographical [[The Human Condition (novel)|novel of the same name]], which strongly resonated with the director [[Masaki Kobayashi]]. Like the novel's protagonist, he was drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during World War II and stationed in Japan-occupied [[Manchuria]]. Self-described as a pacifist and socialist, he had refused to rise above the rank of a private, feeling opposed to both the war and Japan's imperialist ideology at the time. Kobayashi adhered to such views for the rest of his life, always remaining critical of Japan's conformist culture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grilli|first1=Peter|title=Interview with Masaki Kobayashi|url=http://eigageijutsu.blogspot.com/2011/12/interview-with-masaki-kobayashi.html|website=Nihon Cine Art|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nRemembering his own experiences in the war and feeling connected to the novel's events, Kobayashi secured the rights from Gomikawa and petitioned [[Shochiku]] to approve the project. Due to the subject matter directly criticizing the actions of Japan during World War II, the studio was initially unenthusiastic about the film and only relented when Kobayashi threatened to quit.<ref name=\"kempphilip\">{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Philip|date=9 September 2009|title=The Human Condition: The Prisoner|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7415-the-human-condition-the-prisoner|url-status=live|access-date=15 March 2015|website=Criterion|publisher=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> During filming, Kobayashi aimed to be as faithful to Gomikawa's work as possible; he had a copy of the original novel on hand to help in this regard. If any scenes were in the book, but not the script, they would be added in when possible. The actors were usually notified of these changes a day in advance to memorize their new lines. Because of this striving for accuracy, Gomikawa was reportedly very pleased with the adaptation.<ref name=nakadai />\n\n[[Tatsuya Nakadai]], who had previously appeared in Kobayashi's ''The Thick-Walled Room'' and ''[[Black River (1957 film)|Black River]]'', was specifically chosen by the director to play the protagonist Kaji. Much of the supporting cast were veteran film and stage actors who had previously worked with Kobayashi on other projects, or who would later become regulars with the director. The film marked Nakadai's first leading role, and he later recalled his performance as being exceptionally challenging. Certain fight scenes called for actual contact, leading to the actor's face becoming swollen. The final sequence additionally involved Nakadai lying face-down in a field, the cameras not stopping until he was completely covered in a mound of snow.<ref name=nakadai>{{cite web|last1=Nakadai|first1=Tatsuya|title=Criterion Collection Interview with Tatsuya Nakadai|location=Found on the Criterion Collection's DVD release of ''The Human Condition''}}</ref>\n\nAs opposed to hiring Shochiku staff, the crew from the independent studio Ninjin Club were used instead. Kobayashi utilized cinematographer [[Yoshio Miyajima]] for the film, having been an admirer of his work for director [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shinoda|first1=Masahiro|title=Directors Guild of Japan video interview with Masaki Kobayashi, conducted by Masahiro Shinoda|location=Found on the Criterion Collection's DVD release of ''The Human Condition''}}</ref> Despite featuring extensive dialogue in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], none of the actors were actually [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. These lines were spoken [[phonetically]] with accompanying burnt-in Japanese subtitles on all prints. Non-Japanese and [[Russian people|Russians]] were seemingly used for the roles of Soviet soldiers, though only Ed Keene and Ronald Self are credited. Due to the non-existent [[China\u2013Japan relations]] at the time, Kobayashi scouted out filming locations in [[Hokkaido]] for the Manchurian setting over two months. Including pre-production, ''The Human Condition'' took four years to complete.<ref name=nakadai />\n\n==Release==\nNoted for its length, ''The Human Condition'' runs at nine hours, and thirty-nine minutes (579 minutes) and would be the longest film in Kobayashi's career.\n\nThe film was released as a trilogy in Japan between 1959 and 1961, while shown at various film festivals internationally. All-night marathons of the entire trilogy were occasionally shown in Japan; screenings with Tatsuya Nakadai in attendance typically sold out.<ref name=nakadai /> In 1999, [[RLJE Films|Image Entertainment]] released ''The Human Condition'' on three separate Region 0 DVDs. These discs were criticised for their image and sound quality and translation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Human Condition DVD Comparison|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews46/the_human_condition.htm|website=DVD Beaver|publisher=DVD Beaver|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> On 8 September 2009, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the entire trilogy with restored image, new translation and supplements.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Criterion Collection: The Human Condition|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/2106-the-human-condition|website=Criterion|publisher=The Criterion Collection|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref> [[Arrow Video]] released a dual-format (Blu-ray and DVD) edition of ''The Human Condition'' in September 2016.
