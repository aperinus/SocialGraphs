[[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] returned to score the film. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2010 action film ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', and stars Sylvester Stallone, [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The story follows the mercenary group known as \"the Expendables\" as they undertake a seemingly simple mission which evolves into a quest for revenge against rival mercenary Jean Vilain, who murdered one of their own and threatens the world with a deadly weapon. It is the second installment in ''[[The Expendables (film series)|The Expendables]]'' film series.\n\nPrincipal photography took place over 14 weeks (beginning in September 2011) on an estimated $100&nbsp;million budget. Film locations included [[Bulgaria]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[New Orleans]]. Controversy arose over the accidental death of a stuntman and environmental damage caused during filming in Bulgaria.\n\nThe film was released in Europe on August 16, 2012, and in North America the following day. ''The Expendables 2'' grossed over $310&nbsp;million worldwide, with its greatest success outside North America. Critics generally considered the film an improvement over its predecessor (citing an increased use of humor and action scenes), but its plot and dialogue received criticism. A tie-in downloadable video game was released on July 31, 2012, as a prequel to the events of the film. A sequel, ''[[The Expendables 3]]'', was released on August 15, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Expendables\u2014leader Barney Ross, knife specialist Lee Christmas, hand-to-hand combat specialist Yin Yang, heavy-weapons specialist Hale Caesar, demolitions expert Toll Road, the unstable Gunner Jensen, and sniper Billy the Kid, the team's newest recruit and Ross' prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2014are deployed to [[Nepal]] to rescue Dr. Zhou, a hostage. They also rescue the captured mercenary Trench, Ross's rival. Yang leaves the group to escort Zhou back to China.\n\nAfter returning to New Orleans, Billy tells Ross that he intends to retire at the end of the month and live with his girlfriend Sophia. Later, Ross is forced to accept a mission from CIA operative Mr. Church to retrieve an item from a downed airplane in [[Albania]]. Church sends technical expert Maggie Chan with the team. In Albania the Expendables retrieve the item, but are then ambushed by international criminal and arms dealer Jean Vilain, his right-hand man Hector and his mercenary group (the Sangs), who have captured Billy. Vilain demands the item in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up the item, but Vilain roundhouse kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain.\n\nMaggie tells them that the item is a computer, with the location of five tons of refined [[plutonium]] abandoned in a mine by the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Cold War]]. Vilain intends to retrieve the plutonium and sell it. The Expendables are able to weakly track the computer's signal and follow Vilain, which leads them to [[Bulgaria]] where they stay overnight at an abandoned Russian military base. The next morning, the team is ambushed by the Sangs and a tank. After the Expendables run out of ammunition, they are saved by Ross's old friend, Booker, who quickly eliminates both the Sangs and the tank. Before he departs, Booker informs the group of a nearby village whose residents oppose Vilain. Meanwhile, Hector and Vilain dig up the plutonium and begin collecting it.\n\nIn the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers guarding their children from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately crashing into the mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.\n\nChurch and Trench arrive, freeing the miners and the team, and join the Expendables to pursue Vilain. The group intercepts Vilain and his men at an airport as he prepares to leave by plane. Joined again by Booker, the Expendables, Trench and Church engage the Sangs in battle. Christmas decapitates Hector, while Ross and Vilain fight hand-to-hand. Ross defeats Vilain, stabbing him and avenging Billy.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ross is given an old [[Antonov An-2]] [[biplane]] by Church; Church, Maggie, Booker and Trench then leave the team. In France, Sophia discovers a box on her doorstep with a large sum of money and Billy's letter. As the Expendables depart in the plane, they propose a final toast to Billy.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Expendables 2 Cast Roster.jpg|thumb|300px|Ensemble cast of action stars, including (left to right) Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Terry Crews|alt=[[Photomontage]] of the film's stars]]\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Barney Ross: \n: The Expendables' leader.

The distributor would produce the film, in exchange for a Chinese actor (Donnie Yen) being cast and filming in China. The partnership was considered to make a Chinese release of the film easier,<ref name=\"YenVariety\"/> and would have granted Millennium Films a larger share of its Chinese revenue.<ref name=\"BOChina\"/> However, the partnership fell apart before production began.<ref name=\"BOChina\"/> However, another Chinese studio, Le Vision Pictures, invested in the film.<ref name=\"SequelChan\"/> [[Lionsgate Films]] purchased the North American and United Kingdom distribution rights to the film for $35&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BOPre\"/>\n\nOn January 19, 2012, Stallone stated that the film was being aimed at a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|PG-13]] audience. Unlike the first film (which was restricted to viewers over age 17), this would have made the sequel available to all viewers over 13 years of age (and younger children, with parental consent). The reported change received a negative reception.<ref name=\"PG13\"/><ref name=\"PG13C\"/> Speaking to [[Ain't It Cool News]] about the change, Stallone said \"The PG-13 rumor is true, but before your readers pass judgement, trust me when I say this film is large in every way and delivers on every level.\"<ref name=\"PG13\"/> It was reported that the change was requested by Norris before he would take part in the film, because he did not appreciate the swearing in the script.<ref name=\"PG13B\"/> However, these plans for a more family-friendly rating did not succeed and the finished film was rated R. When the adult-oriented rating was confirmed shortly before release, West stated that \"the shooting style and the dialogue, from day one, it was R-rated.\"<ref name=\"PG13C\"/> However, the visual effects supervisor said that ''The Expendables 2'' was shot as a PG-13 film, with all bullet wounds being dust-hits. Once it was decided that the film would be R-rated, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and severed limbs were digitally added in post-production.<ref name=\"FX\"/>\n\nVan Damme redesigned his final fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. Van Damme was unhappy with the scripted fight, which had his character running away and only a brief confrontation between the pair. He felt that the audience wanted a longer fight scene between the two actors.<ref name=\"VDRewrite\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Interior, new terminal at Plovdiv Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Plovdiv Airport]] was the background for one of the film's largest action scenes (including the terminal)|alt=Airport terminal, with small round tables covered with large white tablecloths]]\nOn a budget of $100 million,<ref name=\"Budget\"/> [[principal photography]] of ''The Expendables 2'' began on September 29, 2011, and lasted 14 weeks.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=12}}<ref name=\"Rourke2\"/> Filming took place largely in Bulgaria: at the [[Nu Boyana Film]] studio in [[Sofia]], the city of [[Plovdiv]] and the town of [[Bansko]].<ref name=\"CastGeneral\"/>{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=12}}<ref name=\"FilmingLocation1\"/> One of the film's larger set pieces took place at Bulgaria's second-largest airport (in Plovdiv), including gunfights, explosions and car chases throughout the terminal.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=12}} On October 27, 2011, while the second-unit stunt team was filming at the [[Ognyanovo Reservoir]] {{convert|15|mi}} from Sofia, stuntman Kun Liu was killed and another (Nuo Sun), was critically injured in a staged explosion on a rubber boat. Sun underwent a five-hour operation, which left him in stable condition.<ref name=\"FilmingAcc1\"/><ref name=\"FilmingAcc2\"/>\n\nFilming also took place at [[List of caves in Bulgaria|Devetashka Cave]] in [[Lovech Province]].<ref name=\"FilmingAcc3\"/> As part of the cave shoot, [[Bulgarian lev|BGN]]600,000 ($408,762) was spent rebuilding a {{convert|114|m|yd}} bridge from the cave over the [[Osam]] River; only the concrete bridge columns remained from the original structure.

(0:28)|alt=Video sample of the film]]\n''The Expendables 2'' contains approximately 1,547 digital effect shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded in response to changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and {{nowrap|R-Team}}, also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled even if it was not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.<ref name=\"FX\"/>\n\nSeveral sets were rendered digitally, and almost all of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on [[Chroma key]] with the cave background inserted later.<ref name=\"FX\"/>\n\nThe entire opening sequence of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant to take place in tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex digital environment, shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital [[matte painting]]s were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.<ref name=\"FX\"/>\n\nVehicles also received digital enhancement. For the scene in which the Expendables crash their [[Canadair CL-215]] amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use [[Miniature effect]]s, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose-mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane, but the craft's design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves, and so it was digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors, and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8 helicopter]] was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments.<ref name=\"FX\"/> The [[T-72]] tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.<ref name=\"FX\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Controversies}}Controversy===\n[[File:Devetashka pestera lqto 2009 1.JPG|thumb|Devetashka Cave in 2009|alt=Stone arch with foliage, seen from cave entrance]]\nOn November 16, 2011, the production received a fine (between $343\u2013$3,440) from the Bulgarian environmental protection agency for unlawfully removing shrubs and small trees from the entrance of Devetashka Cave. Although permits had been obtained allowing sets to be built in the area (including a bridge to the cave), environmentalists complained that filming could damage the cave (home to about 40 endangered species). To avoid further problems, the producers agreed not to film explosions, car chases and fires near the cave.<ref name=\"FilmingAcc3\"/>\n\nHowever, later that month Bulgarian environmentalists stated that the bat population in the cave had been reduced by up to 75% (from about 30,000 in 2010 to 8,000 in 2011). Nikolay Simov of the Center for Bat Studies and Protection at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences blamed ''The Expendables 2''{{'}}s production for the reduction.<ref name=\"FilmingNov2711\"/> On January 16, 2012, the Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Prosecutor's Office overturned a ruling by its Lovech equivalent to prevent an investigation of what environmentalists stated to be an \"excessive\" number of dead bats found in the cave after filming (including several endangered species). The [[European Commission]] became involved, contacting the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Waters for information about the dead bats; the Bulgarian Ministry and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences conducted their own probe, stating that the bat kill was within normal parameters.
