Produced by [[Scott Rudin]] and Eli Bush, the film stars Rock, [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Gabrielle Union]], and follows [[New York City]] comedian and film star Andre Allen (Rock), who has to confront his past and comedic career while doing an interview with journalist Chelsea Brown (Dawson).\n\nThe ensemble cast features comedians [[J. B. Smoove]], [[Kevin Hart]], [[Sherri Shephard]], [[Michael Che]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Jay Pharoah]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Cedric the Entertainer]]. Comedians [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]] appear as themselves.\n\nIt was screened in the Special Presentations section of the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on December 12, 2014 by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"Indiewire\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/tiff-toronto-intl-film-festival-gala-special-presentations-1201266480/ |title=Toronto Film Festival Lineup |access-date=July 22, 2014 |work=Variety|date=July 22, 2014 }}</ref> It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at the performances of the cast, and Rock's screenplay and direction, as well as comparisons to [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' (1980).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400 to 700 words only-->\n''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Chelsea Brown is spending a day interviewing comedian and recovering alcoholic Andre Allen, star of the hit film franchise ''Hammy The Bear,'' about a cop in a bear suit. Chelsea has forgotten her audio recorder, so they first go to her apartment. While there they discuss a magazine article about the [[Cinderella complex]]. Chelsea explains that Cinderella left something behind to let the prince know that she wanted to see him again.\n\nAndre is attempting a foray into serious films with  ''Uprize'', in which he portrays [[Haitian Revolution]] figure [[Dutty Boukman]], and is sensitive to criticism, particularly by ''Times'' critic James Nielson, whose previous reviews of Andre's work have been negative and insulting. As the interview begins in his limousine, Andre recalls his lowest point, when he was in [[Houston]] in 2003 and met Jazzy Dee, who supplied him with drugs, alcohol and women. When Jazzy refused to pay the women, they contended they were raped, leading to Andre's arrest and subsequent sobriety.\n\nAfter the limo gets hit by a cab, Andre and Chelsea wander the city. Andre stops at a jewelry store to pick up the rings for his wedding to reality-TV star Erica Long. Following a subtle, tense interaction with Andre assisting an acquaintance who is actually his father, they visit the apartment of Andre's old friends and his ex-girlfriend. Chelsea interviews each, learning that Andre wasn't particularly funny when he started in stand-up comedy. They nominate their five favorite rappers, including a sixth in their lineups as well. Andre goes to radio shows such as ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' to promote ''Uprize'' and attends a press conference with fellow stars including [[Taraji P. Henson]] and [[Gabourey Sidibe]]. To his chagrin, Andre is asked when there will be another Hammy movie.\n\nAt a hotel, Andre and Chelsea unexpectedly encounter her boyfriend, Brad, along with his friend Ryan, who is wearing Brad's shirt. Chelsea deduces Brad is cheating on her with Ryan. She and Andre, both recovering alcoholics, stop in a liquor store but resist making a purchase. Chelsea explains in graphic detail how the signs were there that Brad was gay. Andre laughs, calling Chelsea naive. She becomes angry and insults his movie, but the two end up kissing. Andre asks to borrow Chelsea's phone, since his own died. While using it, he sees an email from her editor, revealing James Nielson is Chelsea herself. The truth devastates Andre, who angrily tells Chelsea he felt he was never funny unless he was drunk or high, and now is fearful for his career. Despondent and acting out at a supermarket, he is arrested by police.\n\nIn jail, Andre calls Erica, who fumes over the arrest, mainly because of how it will look for her image. She tells Andre this piece of fame is all she has since she thinks she has no other talent. Erica's manager Benny takes the phone and tells Andre to go to his bachelor party for good press and fly out for the wedding. Andre's bodyguard Silk bails out Andre, and they go to a strip club for a bachelor party with a theme based on Hammy The Bear. There, Andre hangs out with [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. They give him different views on marriage and sex. Andre runs into Chelsea, who wants to make it up to him and invites him to follow her.\n\nAndre, Chelsea, and Silk go to the [[Comedy Cellar]], where Andre gets up onstage and performs standup for the first time in years. He turns out to still be funny, and the crowd loves him. After the performance, he tells Chelsea he got inspired to return to standup after being in jail and talking to [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], who told Andre he does not want to keep rapping and wants to sing instead. He then sings \"[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]\", terribly.\n\nThey drop Chelsea off at her place, where she and Andre share one last kiss before departing. Andre asks for her top five rappers, which she lists. While driving away, Silk tells Andre he should have gone after Chelsea. Andre goes through the gift bag from the party and finds items including a scented candle and a bottle of vodka. Then he pulls out a slipper, and Silk smiles.\n\nAfter the credits begin rolling, the movie returns to the party, where Jerry Seinfeld shares his \"top five\" as [[The Sugarhill Gang|Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eminem]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Ice Cube]], and [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Andre Allen\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Chelsea Brown, a journalist assigned to interview Andre<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite web |first= Smriti |last= Mundhra |work= BET.com |date= June 26, 2013 |title=Kevin Hart to Play Chris Rock's Agent in Finally Famous|url=http://blogs.bet.com/celebrities/what-the-flick/kevin-hart-to-play-chris-rocks-agent-in-finally-famous/|access-date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Erica Long, Andre's fianc\u00e9e<ref>{{cite web |author= Star, Lucas |date= May 17, 2013 |work=[[TheWrap]] |title=Gabrielle Union to Play Chris Rock's Fianc\u00e9e in His 'Finally Famous' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/gabrielle-union-play-chris-rock-s-fiancee-his-finally-famous-exclusive-92236|access-date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Charles, Andre's Ivy League-educated agent <ref name=\"Hart\"/>\n* [[Sherri Shepherd]] as Vanessa, Andre's ex-girlfriend who still lives in the neighborhood<ref name=\"Hart\"/>\n* [[J.
