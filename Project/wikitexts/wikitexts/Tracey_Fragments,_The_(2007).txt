Based on Medved's [[The Tracey Fragments (novel)|1998 novel of the same name]], it stars [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} as Tracey Berkowitz exploring the city in search of her missing brother, presented in a [[nonlinear narrative]] and [[Split screen (video production)|split screen format]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[57th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it was awarded the Manfred Salzgeber Prize for innovative filmmaking.<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 19, 2007|title=Canadian wins Berlin festival breakthrough award|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadian-wins-berlin-festival-breakthrough-award-1.630745|url-status=live|website=[[CBC Arts]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFifteen-year-old Tracey Berkowitz is first seen naked in a tattered shower curtain at the back of a bus, looking for her little brother Sonny, who thinks he's a dog. The film shares its story in choppy, disjointed fragments, telling the story from Tracey's point of view.\n\nTracey is a caustic, sarcastic, and vulgar teenager, living with her well-meaning but often verbally abusive and neglectful parents. Bullied at her public school, Tracey's closest person to a friend is her homely psychiatrist, Dr. Hecker, who is at first cold to her and doubtful of her perception of the world as accurate. Tracey is seen briefly in a flashback at a police station, while her parents tearfully demand to know where their son is. Tracey reveals that she hypnotized Sonny into behaving like a dog, a game between siblings that actually manifested into Sonny acting like a dog all the time, angering her father, who finds it an annoying phase. Sonny gives Tracey a necklace on her birthday, and he's the only person who Tracey expresses a great deal of affection for. Not long after that, Sonny disappeared during a freak blizzard, something shown to be connected with an older boy Tracey had a crush on called \"Billy Zero\". She fantasizes about Billy and her in a famous tabloid relationship, in which they run a [[metalcore]] band duet with Tracey taking on the stage name \"Estuary Palomino\" and bleaching her hair blonde.\n\nTracey's everyday world is shown to involve riding the buses in Manitoba repeatedly, looking for Sonny, having stopped attending classes or living at home. Dr. Hecker becomes more curious about Tracey's strange behaviour, and wonders if she has [[borderline personality disorder]]. Tracey recalls in a flashback her father telling her a bedtime story about Sonny's birth as a child. He tells her that Sonny's mother was a dog who died [[Nunavut|up north]], a statement that confuses Tracey. Meanwhile, on the bus, she begins associating with the other lost and homeless people of the city, mostly hipsters and junkies with similar lives to hers and not a lot of money or emotional support. Tracey witnesses physical violence, drug use, sex and alcohol consumption in her new environment. She asks Dr. Hecker if she could rent a room in her house. Dr. Hecker, pitying Tracey, explains that there are ethical boundaries preventing such an arrangement, and she urges Tracey to go home and reconcile with her family. Tracey stays in the apartment of a grown man, Lance, who promises to help her. She becomes fixated on a crow that keeps stopping by a broken window in the building, and she tries to fit in with an older adult crowd. When Tracey is nearly raped in the apartment, she uses a rusty tin can lid to defend herself, escaping with no clothes on, only the flower-print shower curtain around her shoulders that she grabbed from the apartment at the last minute.\n\nA final flashback reveals that, on the night of the blizzard, Tracey was grounded but escaped her house under the guise of \"taking Sonny for a walk\" while she went to meet Billy. Billy, only interested in hooking up, had sex with Tracey in the back of his car at a deserted park. During this time, Sonny disappeared. It is implied that he fell in the river and drowned. Tracey is devastated. A final fragment shows Tracey wandering naked under her shower curtain, unresponsive, through a Winnipeg park at night. The ground has grass on it, in contrast to the film's mostly winter weather and snow, suggesting a full season has gone by since Sonny's disappearance in the blizzard.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} as Tracey Berkowitz\n* [[Ari Cohen]] as Mr. Berkowitz\n* [[Maxwell McCabe-Lokos]] as Lance\n* Erin McMurtry as Mrs. Berkowitz\n* [[Slim Twig]] as Billy Zero\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Dr. Heker\n* [[Kate Todd]] as Debbie Dodge\n* [[Ryan Cooley]] as David Goldberg\n* Libby Adams as Young Tracey Berkowitz\n* Zie Souwand as Sonny Berkowitz\n* Derek Scott as Headstand Johnny\n* Sydney Rodgers as Tracey Berkowitz Imagination\n* [[Stephen Amell]] as Detective\n* [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] as himself<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thetraceyfragments.blogspot.com/2007/10/bruce-mcdonald-on-hour-with-george.html|title=Bruce McDonald on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos CBC|website=The Tracey Fragments|accessdate=12 March 2020|date=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Tracey Fragments multi-frame.png|thumb|right|250px|A multiframe sequence from the film showing its visual style, which polarized critics.]]\nMcDonald read the book and called it \"like a contemporary ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]''\", and contacted to Medved, who wrote a first draft script that was used in the film.
