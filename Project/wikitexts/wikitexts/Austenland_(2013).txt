Based on [[Shannon Hale]]'s 2007 [[Austenland|novel of the same name]] and produced by author [[Stephenie Meyer]], it stars [[Keri Russell]] as a single thirty-something obsessed with [[Jane Austen]]'s 1813 novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', who travels to a British resort called Austenland, in which the Austen era is recreated. [[JJ Feild]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], [[Bret McKenzie]], and [[Jennifer Coolidge]] co-star.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nJane Hayes, an American woman obsessed with [[Jane Austen]] \u2013 especially [[Colin Firth]]'s portrayal of [[Mr. Darcy]] in the [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|1995 BBC adaptation of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] \u2013 spends her entire savings on a trip to a [[Jane Austen]]-themed resort in England. At \u201cAustenland\u201d, guests receive pseudonyms and period costumes, living as ladies of the [[Regency era]]. The highlight of the resort is guaranteed romance with the male actors, though no touching is allowed.\n\nWhile Jane can only afford the cheapest \"copper\" package, the other guests have purchased the most expensive \"platinum\" option. Although she befriends fellow guest Ms. \u201cElizabeth Charming\u201d, Jane is treated with disdain by the manager, Mrs. Wattlesbrook, who prefers the wealthier guests. \n\nJane and Elizabeth meet their actor-companions \u2013 the obsequious Colonel Andrews and the unenthusiastic Mr. Henry Nobley, Mrs. Wattlesbrook's nephew \u2013 and \u201cLady Amelia Heartwright\u201d, another guest. Amelia and Elizabeth flirt openly with Nobley, whom is reserved and Jane finds disagreeable. (Their argument mirrors the first meeting of [[Elizabeth Bennet]] and Mr. Darcy in ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'').\n\nMartin, the resort's chauffeur/stablehand, flirts with Jane. Jealous, Nobley rescues her from walking in the rain. She visits Martin at his quarters; after more flirting and witnessing the birth of a foal, they kiss, and spend the following afternoon together. When another actor, the muscular Captain George East, arrives and flirts with Jane, Martin rebuffs her for \"parading around\" with the actors. She asks if he is breaking up with her, and he replies that they were never \"going steady\".\n\nForced to play piano for the group, Jane performs the only song she knows, \"[[Hot in Herre]]\", shocking Mrs. Wattlesbrook. On her way to find Martin, Jane is stopped by Nobley, who warns against \u201ccavorting with the servants\". Returning to the house, Jane fights off a drunken Mr. Wattlesbrook.\n\nDetermined to find love by the end of her stay, Jane takes charge of her \"story\". Elizabeth helps her steal some of Amelia's costumes, and Jane charms the group with her new-found confidence. Mrs. Wattlesbrook discovers Jane's contraband cell phone and prepares to evict her, but Amelia lies to save her. In exchange, Amelia blackmails Jane into helping her and East be alone together. \n\nThe party rehearses a play (mirroring what the characters did in ''[[Mansfield Park]]''), and Jane pairs herself with Nobley to allow Amelia time with East. Jane and Nobley bond, and Martin attempts to apologize to her. After the disastrous play, Jane and Nobley sneak off to her room, where he requests a dance during the final ball.\n\nAt the ball, Nobley confesses his love to Jane. Disillusioned after watching the other actors fulfill their guests' fantasies with fake proclamations of love, she declares that she would rather have something real and leaves, spending the evening with Martin.\n\nDeparting Austenland, Jane discovers that Amelia is American, and that Nobley had asked Amelia to pretend Jane's phone was hers to prevent Jane being sent away. Mrs. Wattlesbrook reveals that the actor assigned to Jane was not Nobley, but Martin \u2013 whose romance with Jane was fully scripted. Angry at being duped and certain she is not the only guest assaulted by Mr. Wattlesbrook, Jane threatens to sue Mrs. Wattlesbrook and shut down Austenland.\n\nMartin is sent to the airport to smooth things over with Jane, but Nobley appears, asserting that his own affections were genuine, but Jane dismisses them both. When Nobley tries again to express his feelings, Jane thanks him for being \"perfect\" and leaves.\n\nBack home, Jane clears out her Darcy collection. Nobley arrives, having traveled across the Atlantic to return her sketchpad. He explains that his name truly is Henry Nobley, he is a history professor who simply wanted to experience the Austen era, and that he does love her. Jane finally believes him and they kiss.\n\nA mid-credits scene reveals that Elizabeth has bought Austenland and turned it into a theme park, assisted by Colonel Andrews. Mr. Wattlesbrook now works as a garbage picker, Captain East does a strip show to Amelia's delight, Martin is snubbed by the guests, and Jane and Nobley are still very much in love.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Keri Russell]] as Jane Hayes\n*[[JJ Feild]] as Mr. Henry Nobley\n*[[Bret McKenzie]] as Martin\n*[[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Elizabeth Charming\n*[[James Callis]] as Colonel Andrews\n*[[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] as Mrs. Wattlesbrook\n*[[Georgia King]] as Lady Amelia Heartwright\n*[[Ricky Whittle]] as Captain George East\n*[[Rupert Vansittart]] as Mr. Wattlesbrook\n*[[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]] as Nigel\n\n==Production==\n''Austenland'' was filmed in the summer of 2012 at [[West Wycombe Park]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Other Projects - Austenland Movie|url=https://stepheniemeyer.com/project/fickle-fish-films/|work=Stephenie Meyer website|publisher=Stephenie Meyer|accessdate=June 30, 2021}}</ref> in [[Buckinghamshire]].
