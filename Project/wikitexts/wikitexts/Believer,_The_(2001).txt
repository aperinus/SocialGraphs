As a child, he often challenged his teachers with unorthodox interpretations of scripture. He once argued that the [[Binding of Isaac]] was not about [[Abraham]]'s faith but God's power: that God's purpose was not to have Abraham accomplish a particular task, but rather to demand unquestioning obedience, which Abraham refuses to give. Daniel concluded that God is a bully.\n\nDaniel finds a meeting of [[fascists]] run by Curtis Zampf and Lina Moebius, where he also makes a connection with Lina's daughter Carla. Daniel advocates killing Jews, and a banker named Manzetti in particular, but Curtis and Lina oppose harming Jews on practical if not moral grounds. Impressed with Daniel's intelligence, Lina invites him to their camp retreat in the country. Afterward, Daniel and his neo-Nazi friends pick a fight with two African-American men, get arrested, and are bailed out by Carla. He spends the night with her but returns to his ailing father's home where he is harangued by his sister Linda for his Nazi beliefs, but she also urges him to stay and have ''[[Shabbat]]'' dinner. The men watch television, which is forbidden on Sabbath according to some [[Orthodox Jews]], leading them to commiserate on the incomprehensibility of Jewish law.\n\nGuy Danielsen, a journalist writing an article on hate groups, meets Daniel for an interview. He listens to Daniel's [[antisemitic]] speech, then reveals that he had been in contact with Daniel's old rabbi and knows that Daniel is Jewish. Daniel pulls out a pistol and threatens to commit suicide if Guy publishes the truth.\n\nDaniel goes to the fascist camp retreat, where he meets Drake, a skilled marksman, along with an explosives expert. Six of the retreat participants, including Daniel, go to a Jewish deli, where they torment the owner about [[Jewish dietary laws]] until a fight breaks out. Daniel and his friends are required by a court to take [[sensitivity training]], where they listen to the experiences of [[Holocaust]] survivors. One talks about how his infant son was murdered by a Nazi. Daniel is enraged that the man did nothing to save his son, but all the survivors assert that Daniel would also have done nothing, and he walks out in anger.\n\nThe story haunts him, and he imagines himself as the Nazi. Later that night, Daniel and the gang break into a [[synagogue]], vandalize it, and plant a time bomb under the pulpit. They also tear, trample, and spit on a [[Torah]] scroll, though Daniel protests. After they leave, Daniel takes the scroll and a ''[[tallit|tallit katan]]'' (a small Jewish prayer cloth) with him. The next morning, the neo-Nazis hear on the news that the bomb failed to go off. Back in his cabin, Daniel puts on the tallit under his shirt and performs a combination of the [[Nazi salute]] and a ''[[Torah reading#Hagbaha|Hagbaha]]''.\n\nDrake approaches him with a plan to kill Manzetti. Outside a temple, Daniel fires at him but misses. Drake discovers the tallit and realizes that he is a Jew, so Daniel shoots him and escapes. He continues to meet with Lina and Curtis, who want to start an above-ground movement to bring fascism into the political mainstream, inviting Jews, blacks, and liberals. Daniel reluctantly agrees to help them raise funds. At the meetings that follow, Daniel first charms, then enrages, their potential donors with his intellectual games, leading to his expulsion. When news breaks that Manzetti was killed, Lina suspects Daniel, since he proposed the assassination, but Drake is the real killer.\n\nCarla comforts Daniel and they sleep together at his home. When she sees the stolen Torah, she asks Daniel to teach her [[Hebrew]], ostensibly for intellectual reasons. He soon runs into an old friend and his fianc\u00e9e, Stuart and Miriam, who invite him to a [[Rosh Hashanah]] service, assuming that he is an [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice|anti-racist skinhead]]. When Daniel arrives, another old friend calls him out as a racist skinhead. As he is leaving, Miriam, who works for the [[District Attorney]], tells him that half of the people in Lina's meetings are informants for the D.A. She asks Daniel to record conversations at a meeting so she can help him with possible charges stemming from the Manzetti killing, but he refuses.\n\nAs [[Yom Kippur]] approaches, Daniel calls Miriam and insists on taking Stuart's place leading the [[Ne'ila]] service at the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] on Yom Kippur. He and his friends plant a new bomb under the temple's pulpit even though they find it reinforced, limiting the explosion. When Daniel takes the pulpit the next day, he is shocked to see Carla in the congregation. He again imagines himself in the story the Holocaust survivor told him, this time as both the Nazi and the Jew. With minutes to go, Daniel stops and tells everyone to get out because there is a bomb, but refuses to leave himself.\n\nDaniel is shown ascending the stairs in the Jewish school he left as a child. His old teacher approaches, hoping to talk about the Binding of Isaac, and suggests that Isaac died on the mountain and was reborn in the next world. But Daniel ignores him and keeps going, up, and up, as his teacher urges him to stop, calling out, \"There's nothing up there.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Danny Balint\n** Jacob Green as Young Danny Balint\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Curtis Zampf\n* [[Theresa Russell]] as Lina Moebius\n* [[Summer Phoenix]] as Carla Moebius\n* [[Ronald Guttman]] as Mr. Balint\n* [[Glenn Fitzgerald]] as Drake\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Billings\n* [[Heather Goldenhersh]] as Linda\n* [[A.D.
