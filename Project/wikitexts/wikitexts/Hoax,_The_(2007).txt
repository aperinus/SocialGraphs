The screenplay by [[William Wheeler (screenwriter)|William Wheeler]] is based on the book of the same title by [[Clifford Irving]]. It recounts Irving's elaborate hoax of publishing an [[Clifford Irving#Fake autobiography of Howard Hughes|autobiography of Howard Hughes]] that he purportedly helped write, without ever having talked with Hughes.\n\nThe screenplay was considerably different from the book. Hired as a technical adviser to the film, Irving was displeased with the product and later asked to have his name removed from the credits. It nonetheless earned a positive critical reception, but was a box office bomb, grossing only $11.7 million against a budget of $25 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, publishing executives at [[McGraw-Hill]] express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, ''Rudnick's Problem.'' ''Fake!'', his previous book about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]], had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' editor deems it unsatisfactory.\n\nVacationing with his friend and researcher [[Richard Suskind]], Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire [[Howard Hughes]] arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to [[New York City]] to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \"book of the century\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject.\n\nIrving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a $500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book.\n\nAt the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he will be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of [[Noah Dietrich]], a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions.\n\nAs work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President [[Richard Nixon]]. He believes that Hughes sent the package and convinces himself that Hughes wants this damaging material included in the book, as a sign he supports the work.\n\nAs the publication date draws near, Irving elaborates his hoax, staging an \"aborted\" meeting between Hughes and the publishers. Hughes has officially denied that he is involved in the work, but the McGraw-Hill executives are convinced it is genuine. They begin to think it will be a bestseller, and Irving works to gain larger payments for himself and (purportedly) Hughes. Irving and Edith concoct a scheme for her to deposit Hughes's check, payable to \"H. R. Hughes\", into a Swiss bank account using a forged passport with the name \"Helga R. Hughes.\"\n\nThe continuing drama makes Irving increasingly paranoid. He has alcohol-fueled fantasies about being kidnapped by Hughes's people. His affair with Van Pallandt continues, and the pressure of keeping up a pretense of fidelity with his wife adds to his stress. In what is implied to be a favor to Nixon, Hughes goes public via a televised conference call and denies any knowledge of Irving or the book. Irving is arrested and agrees to cooperate if Edith is granted [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. At a press conference, a government spokesman announces that Irving, Edith, and Suskind have received short jail sentences.\n\nAn overheard radio report details a sudden wave of legal decisions in favor of Hughes. Irving believes this indicates that his book had been used to place the president in debt to Hughes. A fleeting scene set inside the Nixon White House suggests that Nixon's preoccupation with Hughes led directly to the [[Watergate scandal|burglary and wiretapping of Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel]]. Historians and political analysts dispute this.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/ \"Watergate Aviator connection\"], CBS News</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* Milton Buras as [[Howard Hughes]]\n* [[Richard Gere]] as [[Clifford Irving]]\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as [[Richard Suskind]]\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Edith Irving\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Andrea Tate\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as [[Nina, Baroness van Pallandt|Nina van Pallandt]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Shelton Fisher\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as [[Noah Dietrich]]\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Albert Vanderkamp\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as George Gordon Holmes\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as [[Ralph Graves]]\n\n==Production==\nPortions of the film were shot in the [[Coachella Valley]], California.<ref name=Filming>{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920\u20132011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |work=Filming in Palm Springs |access-date=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305201810/http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 }} \u2666 [http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download Download]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ([[Portable Document Format|Downloadable PDF file]])</ref> Irving was hired by the producers as technical adviser.

He was unhappy with being portrayed as \"desperate and humorless, a washed-up hack writer who lives in a conservative New York suburb.\" Irving observed, \"The movie misses the point that the Howard Hughes hoax was a live-action adventure story concocted by two middle-aged [[hippie]] [[Expatriate|expat]] writers and a Swiss heiress. Edith, my then-wife, a woman of great zest, is portrayed as a dull hausfrau, and [[Nina van Pallandt]], my Danish mistress, as barely one level above a New York hotel hooker. Dick Suskind, witty friend and co-conspirator, is offered to the public as a self-righteous, sweaty buffoon. The scenes that deal with Movie Clifford feuding with Movie Dick, getting him drunk and hiring a [[bargirl]] to seduce him, are totally fictional.
