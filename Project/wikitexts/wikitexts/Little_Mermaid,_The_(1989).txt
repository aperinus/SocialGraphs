The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|28th Disney animated feature film]], it is loosely based on the 1837 Danish [[The Little Mermaid|fairy tale of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The film tells the story of a teenage [[mermaid]] princess named [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]], who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Eric]], which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], to become human and be with him. ''The Little Mermaid'' was written and directed by [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] and produced by Musker and [[Howard Ashman]], who also wrote the film's songs with [[Alan Menken]]. Menken also composed the film's score. The film stars the voices of [[Jodi Benson]], [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]], [[Pat Carroll]], [[Samuel E. Wright]], Jason Marin, [[Kenneth Mars]], and [[Buddy Hackett]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]] planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen's stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Disney Studios chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway-style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to females, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney's first [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster hit]].\n\n''The Little Mermaid'' was released to theaters on November 17, 1989, to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84&nbsp;million at the domestic box office during its initial release,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Little Mermaid (1989) \u2013 Box Office Summary|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=littlemermaid.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=September 7, 2018|archive-date=July 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031530/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=littlemermaid.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> and {{US$|235 million|long=no}} in total lifetime gross worldwide.<ref name=\"DisneyWW\"/> Along with the major success of both the 1986 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] animated film ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9534/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_One|title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One|last=Korkis|first=Jim|website=Mouse Planet|date=February 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9549/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_Two|title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part Two|last=Korkis|first=Jim|website=Mouse Planet|date=March 2, 2011|access-date=November 21, 2019|archive-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029172108/https://www.mouseplanet.com/9549/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_Two|url-status=live}}</ref> and the 1988 Disney/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]] live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', ''The Little Mermaid'' is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling.

She is fascinated by the human world. With her best friend [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flounder|Flounder]], Ariel collects human artifacts in her [[grotto]]. She ignores the warnings of her father [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], the ruler of Atlantica, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden. One night, Ariel, Flounder, and [[Sebastian (The Little Mermaid)|Sebastian]], a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, travel to the ocean surface to watch a birthday celebration for Prince Eric. Ariel falls in love with Eric after watching him for a while. Suddenly a violent storm arrives, wrecking the ship, and knocking Eric overboard. Ariel rescues Eric and brings him to shore. She sings to him but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find the girl who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows to find a way to join him in his world. Discovering a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian about her behavior and learns of her love for Eric. An outraged Triton travels to Ariel's grotto and destroys her collection of artifacts in a misguided attempt to protect her. After a remorseful Triton leaves, two [[eel]]s named [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Flotsam and Jetsam|Flotsam and Jetsam]] convince Ariel to visit [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]] the [[sea witch]].\n\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, Ariel must receive the \"kiss of true love\" from Eric. If Ariel gets Eric to kiss her, she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. Ariel accepts and is then given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who had rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Furious at Ariel's close success, Ursula disguises herself as a beautiful young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song and, in her disguise, Ursula, transformed in Vanessa, casts a hypnotic enchantment on Eric to make him forget about Ariel.\n\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters#Scuttle|Scuttle]], a seagull who Ariel used to visit for inaccurate knowledge of human culture when she was a mermaid, discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who immediately pursues the wedding barge. Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. In the chaos, the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck is destroyed, restoring Ariel's voice and breaking Ursula's enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid and Vanessa transforms back into her true form of Ursula. Ursula then kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. At Ursula's urging, Triton agrees to take Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the Queen of the Seven Seas, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes, causing Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow to a monstrous size.\n\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before Ursula grows past and towers over them. She then gains full control of the entire ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. Just as Ursula is about to kill Ariel, Eric commandeers a wrecked ship and kills Ursula by impaling her with its splintered [[bowsprit]]. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in Ursula's garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton willingly changes her from a mermaid into a human permanently and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart with all of Ariel's friends and family watching them as well.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Little Mermaid characters}}\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]], the 16-year-old mermaid princess of Atlantica who is fascinated with humans, especially Prince Eric.<ref name=\"DisneyChar\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters|publisher=Hyperion|year=1998|pages=344\u2013345|isbn=0-7868-6336-6|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n** Benson also voices Vanessa, Ursula's human alter-ego and disguise.\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#Prince Eric|Prince Eric]], a human prince who is saved by Ariel and is determined to find and marry her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\">{{cite news|date=July 14, 2014|title=The-Little-Mermaid \u2013 Cast, Crew, Director and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715022533/https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/29563/The-Little-Mermaid/cast|archive-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Ursula (The Little Mermaid)|Ursula]], a sea witch who takes Ariel's voice in exchange for human legs, and is determined to ruin her attempts to get Eric to love her.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as [[List of The Little Mermaid characters#King Triton|King Triton]], Ariel's father and the ruler of Atlantica who is prejudiced towards humans.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n* [[Samuel E.

Katzenberg passed the project over, because at that time the studio was in development on a sequel to their live-action mermaid comedy ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' (1984) and felt ''The Little Mermaid'' would be too similar a project.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> The next day, however, Katzenberg approved of the idea for possible development, along with ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While in production in the 1980s, the staff found, by chance, original story and visual development work done by [[Kay Nielsen]] for Disney's proposed 1930s Andersen feature.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen's original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\">{{cite AV media |title=Treasures Untold: The Making of Disney's 'The Little Mermaid' |location=''The Little Mermaid'': Platinum Edition |year=2006 |medium=DVD |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nThat year, Clements and Musker expanded the two-page idea into a 20-page rough script, eliminating the role of the mermaid's grandmother and expanding the roles of the Merman King and the sea witch. However, the film's plans were momentarily shelved as Disney focused its attention on ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''Oliver & Company'' as more immediate releases.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> In 1987, songwriter [[Howard Ashman]] became involved with the writing and development of ''The Little Mermaid'' after he was asked to contribute a song to ''Oliver & Company''. He proposed changing the minor character Clarence, the English-butler crab, to a Jamaican crab and shifting the music style throughout the film to reflect this. At the same time, Katzenberg, Clements, Musker, and Ashman revised the story format to make ''The Little Mermaid'' a musical with a Broadway-style story structure, with the song sequences serving as the tentpoles of the film.<ref name=\"commentaryTLM\" /> Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]], both noted for their work as the writers of the successful [[Off-Broadway]] stage musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', teamed up to compose the entire song score.

Disney's next film, ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', used a digital method of coloring and combining scanned drawings developed for Disney by [[Pixar]] called CAPS/ink & paint ([[Computer Animation Production System]]), which would eliminate the need for cels, the multiplane camera, and many of the optical effects used for the last time in ''The Little Mermaid''. Clements and Musker's next film, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', also used digital coloring via CAPS.

One of the film's most prominent songs, \"[[Part of Your World]],\" was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements and Keane. Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" nearly being cut from 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' when it was appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state.

It was instrumental in re-establishing feature-length animation as a profitable venture for the Walt Disney Company, as the company's theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s.<ref name=\"wakingsleepingbeauty\" /> ''The Little Mermaid'' was the second film, following ''Oliver & Company'', produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since ''[[The Rescuers]]'' in 1977.<ref name=\"wakingsleepingbeauty\" /> Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a result of ''The Little Mermaid'' and increasingly successful follow-ups \u2013 ''Beauty and the Beast'' (1991), ''Aladdin'' (1992), and ''The Lion King'' (1994). The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in [[Burbank, California]], Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]], France.<ref name=\"WDFAtimeline\">{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Moore|title=After the Magic|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2004-06-20-0406180524-story.html|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|pages=F1, F6|date=June 20, 2004|access-date=November 3, 2021|archive-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003204828/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2004-06-20-0406180524-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, ''The Little Mermaid'' signaled the re-establishment of the musical film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" /> 1988's ''Oliver & Company'' had served as a test of sorts to the success of the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of ''The Little Mermaid''.<ref name=\"makingofTLM\" />\n\n===Sequels===\n*A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] titled ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' was released on September 19, 2000.

The story is set before the events of the original film, in which King Triton has banned music from Atlantica.\n\n===Television===\n*An [[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|animated series]] prequel based on the film premiered in late 1992 on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] television network, following Ariel's adventures before the events of the film. The show ran for 31 episodes.\n*A series of shorts starring Sebastian was aired as part of the Disney animated series ''[[Raw Toonage]]'' and ''[[Marsupilami (1993 TV series)|Marsupilami]].''\n*Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, King Triton, Ursula, Prince Eric, Scuttle, Grimsby, and Chef Louie are \"guests\" in ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Ariel, Prince Eric, and Ursula appear in the series' direct-to-video film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]].'' Ursula appears as one of the leading villains in the direct-to-video film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n\n[[File:Portrait d'Ariel la petite sir\u00e8ne.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Ariel meet-and-greet character at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]]]]\n\n===Theme parks===\n*A [[dark ride]] based on the film, [[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure|Ariel's Undersea Adventure]], opened at both [[Disney California Adventure]] at the [[Disneyland Resort]] and [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Ursula is also featured as a tutorial boss in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' and Ariel appears as a Summon in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n*In the [[City-building game|world builder]] video game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'', Eric's castle appear as part of the environment.
