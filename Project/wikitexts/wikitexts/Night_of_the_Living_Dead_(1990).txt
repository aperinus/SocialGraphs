During their visit, an elderly man who is in shock and has blood on his forehead, bumps into them and flees in terror. They offer to help him, but they are attacked by a zombie. Johnny is killed while Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what appears to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives after fleeing from a local diner that was attacked by zombies, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows.\n\nThey discover other survivors hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a selfish and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; and teenage lovers Tom Bitner and Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \"death trap\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, while the other survivors go upstairs to continue reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts a large mob of zombies to the farmhouse.\n\nThe group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a few hundred yards away. They find a set of keys within the corpse who lived in the farmhouse. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the set they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the gasoline gushing forth is ignited by a burning piece of wood in the truck. The resulting explosion kills both Tom and Judy.\n\nBen returns to the house to find things beginning to dissolve into chaos. Harry has wrestled Barbara's gun away from her and is now armed. Unknown to the survivors upstairs, the Coopers' daughter Sarah has succumbed to the bite on her arm and has transformed into a zombie; she attacks and bites her distraught mother. When Sarah makes her way upstairs, she triggers a shootout between her father, who is trying to protect her, and Ben and Barbara, who are trying to protect themselves. Both Ben and Harry are badly wounded, and Barbara shoots Sarah. Harry retreats upstairs to the attic, while Ben makes his way to the cellar, where he shoots a reanimated Helen. Ben gradually goes into shock, and after realizing the gas key has been in the cellar the entire time, he laughs mindlessly at the irony before succumbing to his injuries and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara leaves the house alone and attempts to find help. She eventually joins a group of countryside locals who are clearing the area of the undead, and awakens the next day surrounded by the safety of the media and townspeople, led by Sheriff McClelland. Noticing hillbillies playing around with a few zombies, she comments on the similarities between the living and the undead. She returns to the farmhouse to find Ben, who has now been reanimated; he gazes at Barbara before being shot by McClelland. When Harry emerges from the attic alive, Barbara kills him in a fit of rage and retribution for causing Ben's death, and turns to leave the house, telling the vigilantes they have \"another one for the fire.\" Barbara watches as the bodies are burned on a pyre.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tony Todd]] as Ben\n* [[Patricia Tallman]] as Barbara Todd\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Harry Cooper\n* McKee Anderson as Helen Cooper\n* [[William Butler (actor)|William Butler]] as Tom Bitner\n* [[Katie Finneran]] as Judy Rose Larson\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Johnny Todd\n* [[Heather Mazur]] as Sarah Cooper\n* [[Russell Streiner]] as Sheriff McClelland (uncredited)\n* Bud Koffler as Zombie Hunter\n* Greg Funk as Cemetery Zombie\n* Pat Logan as Uncle Rege\n* Albert Shellhammer as Cousin Satchel\n\n== Production ==\nRomero said that the remake came about in part because of issues over profits of the original film.  A lengthy court battle over the rights to the film, plus an oversight that caused the [[copyright notice]] not to be included, caused Romero to see little in the way of profit.  Romero's production company, Image Ten, eventually won the lawsuit, but the distributor went out of business before they could collect any money.\n\nAnother issue was the fact that the filmmakers were worried that someone else might make an unauthorized remake.  Romero contacted [[Menahem Golan]] when he heard that [[21st Century Film Corporation]] was interested in a remake, and Romero, Russo, and Streiner collaborated for the first time in 20 years.<ref name=\"lat\" />  Savini was initially hired to perform the special effects, but was persuaded to direct by Romero.{{sfn|Kane|2010|p=160}}  Savini was drawn to the remake because he was unavailable to do special effects on the original.<ref name=\"savini\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/TomSavini/TomSavini.html|title=An Interview with Tom Savini|last=Schultz|first=Gary|work=FilmMonthly.com|date=January 14, 2003|access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[special effect]]s team intentionally kept the effects restrained, as they felt that excessive gore would be disrespectful to the original film.<ref name=\"lat\" /> To keep the effects realistic, they used as inspiration a real [[autopsy]], [[forensic pathology]] textbooks, and [[Nazi death camp]] footage.

Savini said that only 40% of his ideas made it into the final film. Without Romero on set, he clashed with the producers, who did not allow him to explore his vision for the film.<ref name=savini/>\n\n== Release ==\nTo avoid an [[NC-17 rating]], Savini had to cut several scenes from the film.
