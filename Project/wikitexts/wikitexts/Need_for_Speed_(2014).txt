It is the film adaptation of the [[racing video game]] [[Need for Speed|franchise of the same name]] by [[Electronic Arts]]. The film stars [[Aaron Paul]], [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Kid Cudi|Scott Mescudi]] in his feature film debut, [[Imogen Poots]], [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Michael Keaton]]. It tells the story of street racer Tobey Marshall, who sets off to race cross-country as a way of avenging his friend's death at the hands of a rival racer, Dino Brewster.\n\n''Need for Speed'' was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on March 14, 2014, in 3D, [[IMAX 3D]], and conventional theaters. After its release, the film received generally negative reviews, criticized for its direction, nonsensical story, and acting of the supporting cast, though some praise for Paul's acting. The movie grossed $203 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTobey Marshall is a former race car driver who owns his late father's garage, Marshall Performance Motors, in [[Mount Kisco, New York]], where he and his friends tune performance cars. Struggling to make ends meet, he and his crew participate in street races after hours. After a race, Tobey's former rival Dino Brewster conscripts them into completing the build of a rare [[Shelby Mustang#2013-2014 Ford Shelby GT500|Ford Shelby Mustang]] worked on by the late [[Carroll Shelby]], in exchange for 25% of the car's sales revenue. The completed Mustang is displayed for auction at a party in [[New York City]]. Tobey and Dino meet Julia, an English car broker whose client, Bill Ingram, wants to purchase the car if they can prove it will drive over 230&nbsp;mph, as Tobey claims. Despite Dino's objections, Tobey takes the Mustang to a local race track and successfully drives it at 234&nbsp;mph, convincing Ingram to purchase it for $2.7 million.\n\nEnraged by Tobey's disobedience to his objections, Dino challenges Tobey and his friend Pete to a race after Pete flatly tells Dino that everyone knows Tobey is a better driver than him. Dino offers to relinquish his entire share of the Mustang sale if Tobey wins, otherwise Tobey will have to forfeit his share. He challenges them to race with his uncle's three [[Koenigsegg Agera#Koenigsegg Agera R (2011\u20132014)|Koenigsegg Agera R]] cars illegally imported from Europe. On the home stretch, realizing he is going to lose, Dino intentionally bumps into Pete's car, sending it down a ravine and killing Pete as it bursts into flames. Dino disappears from the scene, while Tobey is arrested by the police and sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, unable to prove Dino was there.\n\nUpon his release on parole, Tobey sets out to avenge Pete's death. He borrows Ingram's Mustang to enter the De Leon, a winner-takes-all [[Supercar|exotic car]] [[Street racing|race]] organized by the mysterious Monarch, but as a condition, Ingram requires Julia to accompany Tobey while Tobey is driving the Mustang. The pair have 45 hours to reach [[San Francisco]] before the race starts. In [[Detroit]], they cause an interstate chase with the [[Michigan State Police]] and upload the footage. Dino offers his rare [[Lamborghini Sesto Elemento]] to anyone who can stop Tobey entering the race, causing a group of truckers to go after the Mustang as well. Julia retaliates by convincing Monarch of Tobey's innocence, securing his invitation to the De Leon.\n\nIn [[Utah]], Tobey and Julia are ambushed by truckers, forcing them off the road. Benny, a member of Tobey's crew, appears in a military helicopter stolen from the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], and carries the Mustang mid-air to Tobey's crew at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], getting himself arrested in the process. Tobey and Julia reach San Francisco's [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]] in time to register for the race, but on [[Nob Hill, San Francisco|Nob Hill]], a tow truck smashes into the Mustang, wrecking it and injuring Julia. Desperate to get another car for the race, Tobey meets Dino's fianc\u00e9e Anita, his ex-girlfriend and Pete's sister. Having discovered Dino's involvement in Pete's death, Anita gives Tobey the location of Dino's hidden Koenigsegg, which Tobey and crew member Joe extract. Tobey meets Julia at a San Francisco hospital, confessing his feelings for her with a kiss and letting her know that he has a \"fast\" car, and that this is for Pete.\n\nThe next morning, Tobey surprises Dino by showing up in the Koenigsegg he had driven when Pete was killed, and giving him Anita's engagement ring, informing Dino that she is through with him. Besides the Koenigsegg and Dino's [[Lamborghini Sesto Elemento|Lamborghini]], the other participating cars and drivers include:\n:*Texas Mike's [[McLaren P1]]\n:*Johnny V's [[GTA Spano#First generation (2013\u20132015)|GTA Spano]]\n:*The Gooch's [[Saleen S7#S7 Twin Turbo|Saleen S7 Twin Turbo]]\n:*English Paul's [[Bugatti Veyron#Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport, World Record Edition (2010\u20132011)|Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport]]\nIn the ensuing race along the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]], the racers and pursuing [[California Highway Patrol]] officers crash one-by-one, leaving Tobey and Dino racing side-by-side. Dino attempts to ram Tobey the same way he killed Pete, but Tobey dodges, causing Dino to crash and flip over. Tobey pulls Dino from the wreckage before reaching the finish line, but not without punching Dino to avenge Pete; both are subsequently apprehended by the police, with Dino eventually convicted of the murder of Pete.\n\n178 days later, Tobey is released, and Julia meets him at the prison gates in a [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|2015 Ford Mustang]]. The couple drives to a prison in Utah, where Benny is getting released early for good behavior.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Tobey Marshall: a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] mechanic and skilled former race car driver from [[Mount Kisco, New York]] who is [[Frame-up|framed]] for a [[federal crime]] he didn't commit.\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Dino Brewster: a former [[Indianapolis 500|Indy]] racer and Tobey's fierce rival.\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Julia Maddon: a savvy exotic car broker, who becomes Tobey's love interest.\n* [[Kid Cudi|Scott Mescudi]] as Sergeant Benny \"Maverick\" Jackson: a member of Tobey's crew, and a former National Guard soldier.

He owns a [[Cessna 182]].\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ramon Rodriguez]] as Joe \"Beasty\" Peck: a member of Tobey's crew.
