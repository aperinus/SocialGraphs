After finding the road he was driving along mysteriously replaced with a large lake, he enters a coffee shop to find a phone. Minami is given a complimentary meal that makes him violently throw up in the bathroom and returns to discover that Ozaki's body is missing. When he asks the people in the town, he finds most of them apprehensive and uncooperative. He then sets out to explore the nearly-deserted, run-down suburb of Nagoya in a desperate attempt to recover the body, only to find himself caught in a series of increasingly surreal situations. He meets several strange characters including an elderly innkeeper obsessed with her breast milk, her strange brother who can supposedly channel spirits, a waiter who died three years ago in a car accident and ''gozu'' or a man with a cow's head, who appears to him in a dream.<ref name=\":1\" /> Minami tracks Ozaki to a junk yard, where he is told that he was murdered and turned into a skin suit. He returns to his car to find a girl (Yoshino) who claims to be Ozaki. After sharing intimate details of their life, as well as one of his dreams, he believes her.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMinami and the female Ozaki spend the night at a hotel. During the night, Minami hears what sounds like a voice emanating from the female Ozaki\u2019s vagina while she sleeps. She wakes up and asks Minami if he wants to have sex with her; he rejects her advances.\n\nThe next day, Minami drives the female Ozaki back to his gang\u2019s office, with the intent of explaining the situation to his boss. However, once they arrive, the female Ozaki claims that she is actually the daughter of another yakuza family\u2019s deceased boss, and that she wishes to start working for Minami\u2019s boss.\n\nThe boss takes the female Ozaki to his office to have sex with her, leaving Minami outside. The boss inserts the handle of a [[Ladle (spoon)|ladle]] into his anus, as this is apparently the only way he can achieve an erection. Minami sneaks back into the office, and confronts his boss; in the ensuing physical altercation, the boss falls backwards, impaling himself on the ladle achieving orgasm. Minami electrocutes the unconscious boss with exposed wires from a light fitting, then leaves with the female Ozaki.\n\nMinami and the female Ozaki return to Minami\u2019s home. Minami gives in to his temptations, and at the behest of the female Ozaki, they begin to have sex. However, as soon as he penetrates her, something latches onto his penis from within the female Ozaki; as Minami recoils in horror, a human hand emerges from the female Ozaki\u2019s vagina. The original male Ozaki then extricates himself from the female Ozaki as Minami cowers in the corner of the room.\n\nIn the final scene of the movie, the two male brothers, along with the female Ozaki, are seen walking down the street together, arms linked.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* Hideki Sone as Minami\n* [[Show Aikawa]] as Ozaki\n* [[Kimika Yoshino]] as Female Ozaki\n* [[Sh\u014dhei Hino]] as Nose\n* [[Keiko Tomita]] as Innkeeper\n* [[Harumi Sone]] as Innkeeper's Brother\n* [[Renji Ishibashi]] as Boss\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nShot on a low budget, the movie was originally planned for [[direct-to-video]] release on [[DVD]].<ref name=\":1\" /> However, its positive reception at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2003 secured its theatrical release overseas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mes|first=Tom|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/gozu.shtml|title=Midnight Eye review: Gozu (Gokudo Kyofu Daigekijo Gozu, 2003, Takashi MIIKE|date=21 May 2003|website=[[Midnight Eye]]|access-date=26 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 72%, based on 57 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gozu|title=Gozu (2003)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the film has a score of 58 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gozu|title=Gozu Reviews - Metacritic|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref> In a review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Michael O'Sullivan wrote that \"''Gozu'' makes little sense on paper.
