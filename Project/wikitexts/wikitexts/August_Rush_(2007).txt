The screenplay is by [[Nick Castle]] and [[James V. Hart]], with a story by [[Paul Castro]] and Castle. It involves an 11-year-old musical prodigy living in an orphanage who runs away to [[New York City]]. He begins to unravel the mystery of who he is, all while his mother is searching for him and his father is searching for her. The many different sounds and rhythms he hears throughout his journey culminate in a major instrumental composition, which concludes the film (\"August's Rhapsody\").\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1995, Lyla Novacek is a cellist studying at the [[Juilliard School]] and living under the strict rule of her father. Louis Connelly is the lead singer of an [[Ireland|Irish]] rock band. They meet and have a [[one-night stand]], but are unable to maintain contact. Lyla discovers that she is pregnant. Following an argument with her overbearing father over her unborn baby, she is struck by a car, forcing her to give birth prematurely. While Lyla is unconscious, her father secretly puts the baby boy up for adoption, telling Lyla that her son died.\n\nEleven years later, the baby is living in a boys' [[orphanage]] under the name Evan Taylor, where he is assigned to a [[social worker]] named Richard Jeffries. Evan is a musical genius and displays [[Savant syndrome|savant]]-like abilities and [[perfect pitch]], which often causes him to be bullied. Convinced that his parents will find him, Evan runs away to New York City, \"following the music\" in the hope it will lead him to his family. He finds a boy named Arthur [[busking]] in [[Washington Square Park]] and follows Arthur to his home in a condemned theatre, where Evan is introduced to \u201cWizard\u201d Wallace, an arrogant and aggressive vagrant and musician who teaches homeless, orphaned, and runaway children to be [[street performer]]s. Evan tries playing Wizard's prize guitar, Roxanne (a Gibson J150ec). Evan is so good that Wizard gives him his old spot in Washington Square Park, along with the guitar, which was also Arthur's. He gives Evan the [[stage name]] \"August Rush\" and tries to market him to clubs. Seeing the posters that Jeffries has placed for the runaway Evan, Wizard destroys all the ones he finds, hoping to keep Evan for his own gain.\n\nLouis now lives in [[San Francisco]] as a talent agent, while Lyla is a music teacher in [[Chicago]]. Louis reconnects with his brothers and decides to try to find Lyla. Lyla is called to her father's deathbed, where he confesses that her son is alive, causing Lyla to abandon her dying father and immediately start looking for her son.\n\nOn arriving at Lyla's apartment in Chicago, Louis talks to one of her neighbors, who mistakenly tells Louis she is on her honeymoon. Despairing, he ends up in New York, where he gets his band back together. After Jeffries meets Wizard and Arthur on the street and becomes suspicious, the police raid the derelict theatre in which Wizard and his \"children\" are living. Evan manages to evade the police and remembers Wizard's advice to never reveal his real name to anyone. Evan (now \"August\") takes refuge in a church, where he befriends a little girl named Hope, who introduces him to the piano and written music. Hope brings August and his abilities to the attention of the parish pastor, who takes August to Juilliard, where he once again impresses the faculty. A [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]] takes shape from August's notes and homework.\n\nIn New York, Lyla goes to Jeffries' office, and Jeffries identifies Evan/August as her son. While looking for him, she takes up the cello again and accepts an offer to perform with the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic]] at a series of concerts in [[Central Park]]. August is selected to perform the rhapsody he has been composing at the same concert. However, Wizard interrupts the rehearsal and, claiming to be his father, manages to pull August out of the school.\n\nOn the day of the concert, August is back in his spot in Washington Square, while Wizard makes plans to smuggle him around the country to play. He meets Louis, and unaware of their blood relationship, they have an impromptu guitar duet. August tells him of his dilemma, and Louis encourages him to go. That evening, with help from Arthur, August escapes from Wizard through the [[Rapid transit|subway]] and heads for his concert. Louis, after his own performance with his reunited band, sees Lyla's name on one of the banners and also heads for the park. Jeffries finds a misplaced flyer for \"August Rush\" with a picture, and also heads for the concert.\n\nAugust arrives in time to conduct his rhapsody, which attracts both Lyla and Louis to the audience, where they are reunited. August finishes his rhapsody and as he turns to discover his parents, he smiles knowing that he has been right all along.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Evan Taylor / \"August Rush\"\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Lyla Novacek, Evan's mother\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Louis Connelly, Evan's father\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Maxwell \"Wizard\" Wallace\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Counselor Richard Jeffries\n* [[Alex O'Loughlin]] as Marshall Connelly, Louis' older brother and Evan's paternal uncle\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Thomas Novacek, Lyla's father and Evan's maternal grandfather\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Dean Alice MacNeil\n* [[Jamia Simone Nash]] as Hope\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Reverend James\n* [[Leon Thomas III]] as Arthur\n* [[Bonnie McKee]] as Lizzy\n* [[Timothy Mitchum]] as Joey\n* [[Becki Newton]] as Jennifer\n* [[Aaron Staton]] as Nick\n* [[Ronald Guttman]] as The Professor\n* [[Michael Drayer]] as Mannix\n* [[Tablo]] as Clarinet player (uncredited cameo)<ref name=\"CJ Entertainment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2008/01/141_17427.html|title=Augusts Success in Korea Surprises US Producer|last=Garcia|first=Cathy Rose|date=16 January 2008|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|location=[[South Korea]]|access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=blobyblo|author-link=Tablo|number=1195135433182564353|date=15 November 2019|title=My hobby of popping up in the most random places continues.<br>First, I appeared as a 9 yr old boy in a hollywood film called August Rush.<br>Then, my artwork appeared in a Justin Bieber video.<br>And now, I\u2019m seated amongst Star Wars / Marvel experts theorizing about Yoda. \ud83e\udd23|access-date=30 November 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Koo Hye-sun]] as Girl on couch (cameo)<ref name=\"CJ Entertainment\" /><ref>\n{{cite\u00a0web|url=https://www.insight.co.kr/news/312197|script-title=ko:\ud560\ub9ac\uc6b0\ub4dc \uba85\uc791 \u2018\uc5b4\uac70\uc2a4\ud2b8 \ub7ec\uc26c\u2019\uc5d0 \u20183\ucd08 \ucd9c\uc5f0\u2019 \ud588\uc5c8\ub358 \u2018\uc804\ucc38\uc2dc\u2019 \uad6c\ud61c\uc120 (\uc601\uc0c1)|last=\uae40|first=\ubbfc\uc9c0|date=15 November 2020|website=\uc778\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8|publisher=\ub274\uc2a41\ucf54\ub9ac\uc544|location=[[South Korea]]|language=ko|access-date=16 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n*\"[[Moondance (Van Morrison song)|Moondance]]\"<br />Written by [[Van Morrison]], Performed by [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]\n*\"This Time\"<br />Written by [[Chris Trapper]], Performed by Jonathan Rhys Meyers\n*\"Bari Improv\"<br />Written by [[Mark Mancina]] and [[Kaki King]], Performed by Kaki King\n*\"Ritual Dance\"<br />Written by [[Michael Hedges]], Performed by Kaki King\n*\"[[Raise It Up (August Rush song)|Raise It Up]]\"<br />Written by Impact Repertory Theatre, Performed by [[Jamia Simone Nash]] and Impact Repertory Theatre<br />Nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]\n*\"Dueling Guitars\"<br />Written by [[Heitor Pereira]], Performed by Heitor Pereira and Doug Smith\n*\"Someday\"<br />Written by J.
