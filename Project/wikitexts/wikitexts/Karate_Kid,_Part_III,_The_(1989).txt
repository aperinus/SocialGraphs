It stars [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Pat Morita]], [[Robyn Lively]], and [[Thomas Ian Griffith]] in his film debut. As was the case with the first two films in the series, it was directed by [[John G. Avildsen]] and written by [[Robert Mark Kamen]], with stunts choreographed by [[Pat E. Johnson]] and music composed by [[Bill Conti]]. In the film, the returning [[John Kreese]], with the help of his best friend [[Terry Silver]], attempts to gain revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi which involves hiring a ruthless martial artist and harming their relationship.\n\nThough moderately successful at the box office, ''The Karate Kid Part III'' received generally negative reviews, with criticism aimed at its rehashing of elements found in its two predecessors, though Griffith's performance as Silver received praise from some critics. It was followed by ''[[The Next Karate Kid]]'' in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nIn September 1985, John Kreese, broke and destitute after the loss of his students due to the events in ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', visits his [[Vietnam War]] comrade, a shady businessman named Terry Silver. Silver vows to personally help him get revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and re-establish Cobra Kai. Silver sends Kreese to [[Tahiti]] to relax and hires Mike Barnes, a vicious national [[karate]] champion, to challenge Daniel at the upcoming All-Valley Karate Tournament. Upon returning to [[Los Angeles]] from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], Daniel and Miyagi discover that the South Seas apartment complex is being renovated, leaving Miyagi unemployed and Daniel homeless. Miyagi allows Daniel to live in his home, as his mother Lucille is in [[New Jersey]] to care for his ill uncle. Daniel uses his college funds to help finance Miyagi's dream of opening a [[bonsai]] shop, and Miyagi makes him a partner in the business. Meanwhile, Silver approaches Daniel and Miyagi as a friend, claiming that Kreese is dead and that he is apologizing on his behalf.\n\nVisiting the pottery store across the street, Daniel meets one of the employees, Jessica Andrews. He later finds out that she is from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and has not made any friends yet during the two months she has worked there. After seeing a picture of her rock-climbing with a man whose face had been torn out of the photo, they plan to go out on a date that evening. However, when Daniel comes to pick Jessica up, they decide to just be friends as he learns that Jessica has made up with her boyfriend.\n\nLater, Barnes and his friends Snake and Dennis harass Daniel and Jessica, and even steal the bonsai trees from Miyagi's shop. In order to replace the missing trees, Daniel and Jessica decide to dig up and sell a valuable bonsai tree that Miyagi brought from Okinawa. As they retrieve it, Barnes and his friends appear and retract their climbing ropes, demanding that Daniel sign up for the tournament. He asks Miyagi to train him for the upcoming tournament, but Miyagi refuses due to his principles.\n\nSilver offers to train Daniel for the tournament at the Cobra Kai dojo with a series of brutal, violent techniques. This alienates Daniel from Miyagi and lead him to violently attack a stranger that was bribed by Silver. Daniel apologizes and makes amends with Jessica as she is packing to go home. She forgives him, and encourages him to make amends with Miyagi. He also promises to send her a Christmas card as he leaves. \n\nLater, after apologizing to Miyagi, Daniel visits Silver at the Cobra Kai dojo to tell him he will not compete at the tournament, but Silver discloses his true agenda as Barnes and Kreese appear. Barnes begins to beat Daniel, but Miyagi intervenes and defeats Kreese, Silver, and Barnes. After the scuffle, he finally agrees to train Daniel. At the tournament, Silver reveals his plan to use Cobra Kai's victory to re-establish Cobra Kai and turn it into a business franchise. Barnes reaches the final round to challenge Daniel. Silver and Kreese instruct Barnes to make Daniel suffer by successively gaining and losing points by using illegal tactics. They taunt him and shout racist insults at Miyagi. The match ends in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death overtime]]. Daniel wants to quit, but Miyagi urges him to continue, saying that whilst it is ok to lose to his opponent, Daniel must not lose to his fear and that his best karate is still inside of him. With this encouragement, Daniel performs the Kata, and strikes Barnes to win the tournament, causing Silver and Kreese to become disgraced and ending their plans to revive Cobra Kai.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Thomas Ian Griffith]] as [[Terry Silver]]\n* [[Robyn Lively]] as [[Jessica Andrews (character)|Jessica Andrews]]\n* [[Sean Kanan]] as [[Mike Barnes (character)|Mike Barnes]]\n* William Christopher Ford as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Dennis|Dennis]]\n* Jonathan Avildsen as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Snake|Snake]]\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]]\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Pat E.
