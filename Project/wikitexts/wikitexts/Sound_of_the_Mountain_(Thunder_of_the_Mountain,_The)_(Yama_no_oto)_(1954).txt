It is based on the novel ''[[The Sound of the Mountain]]'' by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Yasunari Kawabata]].<ref name=\"russell\" />\n\n==Plot==\nShingo, an aging businessman, sees the marriage of his son Shuichi and his daughter-in-law Kikuko, who live in the same household, fall apart due to Shuichi's coldness and adulterous behaviour. Flattered by Kikuko's overt adoration for him, he tries to act as a cornerstone for her. His own daughter Fusako, who left her husband and moved back into her parents' home with her children, blames Shingo for her arranged and failed marriage and for his preference of Kikuko over her. Shingo accompanies Kikuko to a hospital visit, only to learn later that she aborted the child she expected from Shuichi. A secretary from Shingo's company helps him to find Kinu, Shuichi's mistress and an independent businesswoman, who tells him of his son's abusive behaviour. Kikuko finally decides to divorce her husband and, meeting Shingo in a park, tells her father-in-law that she wants to try to live a life on her own.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Setsuko Hara]] as Kikuko Ogata\n* [[S\u014d Yamamura]] as Shingo Ogata\n* [[Ken Uehara]] as Shuichi Ogata\n* [[Y\u014dko Sugi]] as Hideko Tanizaki\n* Teruko Nagaoka as Yasuko\n* Yasuko Tan'ami as Ikeda\n* Chieko Nakakita as Fusako Aihara\n* Rieko Sumi as Kinuko (Kinu)\n\n==Legacy==\nNaruse biographer Catherine Russell sees ''Sound of the Mountain'' as a woman's film, as it reduces the book's perspective of Shingo in favour of the female characters who, with the exception of the passive Kikuko, act outspoken and independently, \"trying to make their way in a world in which men like Shuichi have been psychologically destroyed by the war\".<ref name=\"russell2\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Catherine |date=2011 |title=Classical Japanese Cinema Revisited |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-4411-1681-9}}</ref> The last scene suggests the possibility of change for Kikuko, achieving a positive resolution of her problems.<ref name=\"russell2\" /><ref name=\"Jacoby\">{{cite book |last=Jacoby |first=Alexander |date=2008 |title=Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day |location=Berkeley |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=978-1-933330-53-2}}</ref>\n\nNaruse himself declared ''Sound of the Mountain'' one of his favourites of his films.<ref name=\"russell\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Catherine |date=2008 |title=The Cinema of Naruse Mikio: Women and Japanese Modernity |location=Durham and London |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=978-0-8223-4290-8}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0047682}}\n* {{jmdb title|1954|cd000200}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/cteq/mountain/ |title=Sound of the Mountain: The Beauty of Pessimism |last=S\u00f8dtholt |first=Dag |date=November 2001 |website=Senses of Cinema |access-date=20 January 2021}}\n\n{{Mikio Naruse}}\n{{Yasunari Kawabata}}\n\n[[Category:1954 films]]\n[[Category:1954 drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Yasunari Kawabata]]\n[[Category:Toho films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mikio Naruse]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sanezumi Fujimoto]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ichir\u014d Sait\u014d]]\n[[Category:1950s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
