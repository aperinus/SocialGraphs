Released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] on November 17, 1933, it starred the [[Marx Brothers]] ([[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], [[Chico Marx|Chico]], and [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]] in his final Marx Brothers\u2019 movie) and also featured [[Margaret Dumont]], [[Louis Calhern]], [[Raquel Torres]] and [[Edgar Kennedy]]. It was the last of five Marx Brothers movies released by Paramount Pictures.<ref>Zeppo retired from acting altogether after ''Duck Soup'', becoming a Talent agent.

Relations between Groucho and the Sylvanian ambassador deteriorate during the film, and they go to war at the conclusion.\n\nCompared to the Marx Brothers' previous films, ''Duck Soup'' was a box office disappointment,<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> though not entirely a \"flop\" as is sometimes reported.

Firefly be appointed leader of the small, financially struggling nation of [[Freedonia]] before she will continue to provide much-needed financial aid. Meanwhile, the neighboring country of Sylvania is scheming to annex Freedonia. Sylvanian [[ambassador]] Trentino tries to foment a revolution and court Mrs. Teasdale as he tries to dig up dirt on Firefly by sending in spies Chicolini and Pinky.\n\nAfter failing to collect any useful information against Firefly, Chicolini and Pinky are able to infiltrate the government when Chicolini is appointed Secretary of War after Firefly notices him selling peanuts outside his window. A short time later, Firefly's secretary, Bob Roland, tells Firefly he suspects Trentino's motives and he advises him to get rid of the thin-skinned Trentino by insulting him. Firefly agrees to the plan, but after a series of personal insults exchanged between Firefly and Trentino, the plan backfires when Firefly slaps Trentino instead of being slapped by him. As a result, the two countries come to the brink of war. Adding to the international friction is the fact that Firefly is also wooing Mrs. Teasdale, and, like Trentino, hoping to get his hands on her late husband's wealth.\n\nTrentino learns from sexy spy Vera Marcal that Freedonia's plans of war are in Mrs. Teasdale's safe and he tells her to assist Chicolini and Pinky in stealing them. Chicolini is eventually caught by Firefly and put on trial, during which war is officially declared, and everyone is overcome by war frenzy, breaking into song and dance.  Chicolini and Pinky join Firefly and Bob Roland in anarchic battle, resulting in general mayhem.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, the end of the film finds Trentino caught in a makeshift pillory, with the Brothers pelting him with fruit. Trentino surrenders, but Firefly tells him to wait until they run out of fruit. Mrs. Teasdale begins singing the Freedonia national anthem in her operatic voice and the Brothers begin hurling fruit at ''her'' instead.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Groucho Marx-Margaret Dumont in Duck Soup trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Groucho Marx]] and [[Margaret Dumont]] ]]\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Groucho Marx]] as Rufus T.

Only the names of Chicolini and Mrs. Teasdale were kept. Groucho's character\u2014originally named \"Rufus T. ''Firestone''\"\u2014eventually became Rufus T. Firefly, while the name of Harpo's character\u2014named Pinky in the final product\u2014was given in the Paramount pressbook as \"Brownie\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/images/pressbook.gif | title=Paramount's Press Book }}</ref> \"Ambassador Frankenstein of Amnesia\" was quickly changed to Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Zeppo's character remained Firefly's son until very late in production, finally becoming Bob Roland, his secretary; also, Mrs Teasdale's niece \"June Parker\" transformed into Vera Marcal, first introduced as Trentino's \"niece\" before ultimately becoming his companion.<ref name=\"scripts\"/>\n\n==Production notes==\n===Development===\nThe Marx Brothers' previous film, ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', had been [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s highest-grossing film of 1932.  Encouraged by this success, the studio suggested on August 2, 1932, that they rush out a follow-up. Already at this early stage, the story (provisionally entitled ''Oo La La'')<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> was set in a mythical kingdom. On August 11, 1932, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that production would commence in five weeks with the famed [[Ernst Lubitsch]] directing.\n\nThis was a turbulent time in the Marx Brothers' career. [[The Great Depression]] was raging and Paramount Pictures was attempting to stave off bankruptcy. A reorganization of the studio brought fears that money due the Marxes would never be paid; as a result, the Brothers threatened to leave Paramount and form their own company, Marx Bros., Inc.<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> Their first planned independent production was a film adaptation of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', with [[Norman Z. McLeod|Norman McLeod]] leaving Paramount to direct.<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> During late 1932 and early 1933, Groucho and Chico were also working on ''[[Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel]]'', a [[radio show]] written by [[Nat Perrin]] and [[Arthur Sheekman]]; there was even, at one time, talk of casting the two as their radio characters for the new film<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> (an idea that was eventually used by Perrin in the 1941 Marx Brothers film ''[[The Big Store]]'').<ref name=\"Louvish\"/>\n\nBy October 4, 1932, Arthur Sheekman, [[Harry Ruby]], and [[Bert Kalmar]] began writing the screenplay for the next Paramount film, which was now called ''Firecrackers''.<ref name=\"filmsite\"/><ref name=\"scripts\"/> [[Herman Mankiewicz]] was to supervise production, beginning in January 1933.<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> By December 1932, ''Firecrackers'' had become ''Cracked Ice''.<ref name=\"scripts\">[http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/duck.htm The different scripts for ''Duck Soup''&nbsp;\u2013 Marxology.com]</ref> [[Grover Jones]] was also reported to have contributed to the first draft by Ruby and Kalmar.<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> In ''The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia'', Glenn Mitchell says that \"the first script's content is difficult to determine\".<ref name=\"Mitchell\"/>\n\nOn January 18, 1933, Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones submitted to Paramount their \"Second Temporary Script\" for ''Cracked Ice'',<ref name=\"scripts\"/> and Paramount announced that shooting would commence on February 15. This script shows that the basic plot of ''Duck Soup'' was in place. In February, Paramount announced that the title had been changed to ''Grasshoppers''<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> (\"because animal stories are so popular\"), and that filming was set back to February 20.\n\nHowever, on May 11, 1933, the Marx Brothers' father [[Sam Marx|Sam \"Frenchie\" Marx]] died in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> and shortly afterward the contract dispute with Paramount was settled.<ref name=\"TCM\"/> The ''[[New York Post]]'' reported on May 17 that the Brothers would make a new comedy for Paramount, called ''Duck Soup''. [[Leo McCarey]] was set for direction of the film. Three days later ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|The New York Sun]]'' reported that ''Duck Soup'' would start filming in June. ''Duck Soup''{{'}}s script was completed by July 11.<ref name=\"scripts\"/> The script was a continuation of Ruby and Kalmar's ''Firecrackers''/''Cracked Ice'' drafts, but contained more elements.<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> Many of the film's clever gags and routines were lifted from ''Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel'',<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> giving Perrin and Sheekman an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\n===Title===\nDirector McCarey reportedly came up with the title for the film, having previously used it for [[Duck Soup (1927 film)|an earlier directorial effort]] with [[Laurel and Hardy]].<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> This continued the \"animal\" titles of the Brothers' previous three films, ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'' and ''[[Horse Feathers]]''.<ref name=\"Marxology\">[http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/duck.htm \"The Making of ''Duck Soup''\" \u2013 Marxology.com]</ref>\n\n\"Duck soup\" was American English [[slang]] at that time; it meant something easy to do. Conversely, \"to duck something\" meant to avoid it. When Groucho was asked for an explanation of the title, he quipped, \"Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\"<ref name=\"filmsite\">{{cite web| last = Dirks| first = Tim| title = ''Duck Soup'' review| website = filmsite.org| url = http://www.filmsite.org/duck.html| access-date = 2007-12-30}}</ref>\n\nMcCarey also thought up \"the very Laurel & Hardy-like sequence in which Harpo and Chico stage a break-in at Mrs Teasdale's house.\"<ref name=\"Marxology\"/> Another McCarey contribution was the \"mirror scene\", a revival of an old Marx Brothers [[vaudeville]] act.<ref name=\"Louvish\"/><ref name=\"filmsite\"/>\n\n===Mirror scene===\nIn the \"mirror scene\", Pinky, dressed as Firefly, pretends to be Firefly's reflection in a missing mirror, matching his every move\u2014including absurd ones that begin out of sight\u2014to near perfection. In one particularly surreal moment, the two men swap positions, introducing the question of which is the reflection. Eventually, and to their misfortune, Chicolini, also disguised as Firefly, enters the frame and collides with both of them.\n\nAlthough its appearance in ''Duck Soup'' is the best known instance, the concept of the mirror scene did not originate in this film. [[Harold Lloyd]] used essentially the same routine in his short ''[[The Marathon (film)|The Marathon]]'' (1919). [[Max Linder]] included it in ''[[Seven Years Bad Luck]]'' (1921), where a man's servants have accidentally broken a mirror and attempt to hide the fact by imitating his actions in the mirror's frame.<ref name=\"Steffen\">James Steffen [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=500600&category=Articles \"Seven Years Bad Luck\" (TCM article)]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]] used a similar joke in ''[[The Floorwalker]]'' (1916),<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> though it did not involve a mirror.\n\nThis scene has been imitated many times; for instance, in the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ''[[Hare Tonic]]'',<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> the [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', ''[[The Square Peg]]'' (1959), ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1963), the [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Cat and Dupli-cat]]'' (1967), ''[[Big Business (1988 film)|Big Business]]'' (1988), [[X-Files]] episode [[Dreamland (The X-Files)|\"Dreamland\"]] (1998), ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]'' (2006) and the [[Family Guy]] episode \"[[Road to Germany]]\". Harpo himself did a reprise of this scene, dressed in his usual costume, with [[Lucille Ball]] also donning the fright wig and trench coat, in the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' episode \"Lucy and Harpo Marx\".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0609287/ ''I Love Lucy'': \"Lucy and Harpo Marx\"] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref>\n\n===Other scenes and jokes===\nThe climactic production number ridicules war by comparing [[nationalism]] to a [[minstrel show]]. One segment is a variant on the old [[Spiritual (music)|Negro spiritual]] \"[[All God's Chillun Got Wings (song)|All God's Chillun Got Wings]]\" (and was reportedly considered for deletion for the film's DVD release, for fear of offending [[African Americans]]):<ref name=\"silver\"/>\n<blockquote><poem>They got guns,\nWe got guns,\nAll God's chillun got guns!\nI'm gonna walk all over the battlefield,\n'Cause all God's chillun got guns!</poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother repeated gag involved Harpo, who drives a motorcycle with a sidecar, as a chauffeur, to transport Groucho. Twice, after Groucho gives the orders to Harpo, Harpo rides his motorcycle away, leaving Groucho stranded in the sidecar. Later, Groucho has Harpo sit in the sidecar, while Groucho gets on the motorcycle, the sidecar, with Harpo in it, rides off away, again, leaving Groucho stranded.\n\nShortly after, during the final battle scenes, \"rightfully [...] called the funniest of all of cinema\",<ref name=\"Griffin\"/> Firefly can be seen wearing a different costume in almost every sequence until the end of the film, including [[American Civil War]] uniforms (first Union and then Confederate), a British palace guard uniform, a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] Scoutmaster's uniform, and even a [[Davy Crockett]] coonskin cap. Meanwhile, the exterior view of the building they are occupying changes appearance from a bunker to an old fort, etc. Firefly assures his generals that he has \"a man out combing the countryside for volunteers.\" Sure enough, Pinky is wandering out on the front lines wearing a sandwich board sign reading, \"Join the Army and see the Navy.\" Later, Chicolini volunteers Pinky to carry a message through enemy lines; Firefly tells him, \"[...] and remember, while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker ''you'' are.\" Thomas Doherty has described this line as \"sum[ming] up the [[World War I|Great War]] cynicism towards all things patriotic\".<ref name=\"Doherty\">Doherty, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe melodramatic exclamation \"This means war!\" certainly did not originate with ''Duck Soup'', but it is used several times in the film\u2014at least twice by Trentino and once by Firefly<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/duck-soup-script-transcript-marx.html Transcript of ''Duck Soup'']</ref>\u2014and was repeated by Groucho in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]''. Variations of this phrase later became a frequently used catch-phrase for [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] in [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons.<ref>[[John Canemaker|Canemaker, John]].  ''The Boys from [[Termite Terrace]]''. A Camera Three Documentary, 1975. [[Warner Bros.]] [[cartoon]] [[animation director|director]] [[Chuck Jones]] admitted during this interview that he and his associates \"borrowed\" [[Bugs Bunny]]'s phrase, \"Of course you know, this means war!\", from Groucho Marx. Jones, a fan of the Marx Brothers, laughed, \"We would steal from almost ''any'' source!\"</ref>\n\nIn another scene, the film pokes fun at the [[Hays Code]]. Due to the code, a man and woman could not be shown in bed together. The camera begins the scene in a woman's bedroom, panning across the foot of the bed. A pair of men's shoes are shown on the floor, then a pair of women's shoes and then four [[horseshoe]]s. The camera cuts to a shot of the entire room: Pinky is sleeping in one bed with the horse, while the woman is in another bed.\n\nThe film's writers recycled a joke used in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' in this dialogue with Chico:\n<blockquote>Prosecutor: Chicolini, isn't it true you sold Freedonia's secret war code and plans?<br />Chicolini: Sure! I sold a code and two pairs o' plans!</blockquote>\n\nThe street vendor confrontations are also well-remembered pieces of [[physical comedy]]:<ref name=\"filmsite\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/> Chico and Harpo harass a lemonade seller (comedy film veteran [[Edgar Kennedy]]), egged on by his irritation that they have stolen his pitch.\n\nFirst, there is a scene involving the knocking off, dropping, picking up and exchanging of hats. Later, Kennedy (a much larger man) steals bags of Harpo's peanuts, and Harpo responds by burning Kennedy's new straw boater hat; in return, Kennedy pushes over their peanut wagon. Harpo responds by stepping knee-deep into Kennedy's lemonade tank, where he imitates a stereotypical Italian grape-crushing peasant; this drives off Kennedy's waiting line of customers.\n\nJust before the Mirror Scene is the Radio Scene. Harpo tries the combination to the safe on a box which proves to be a radio, and it starts blaring the break-up strain of John Philip Sousa's \"[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]\". The music continues despite frantic efforts to silence, and finally destroy, the radio, by throwing it out the window, shattering the glass.\n\nHarpo often doffed his hat on-screen, but Chico very rarely removed his [[Tyrolean hat]], even when indoors. For a few seconds on-screen in the earlier scene, Chico's head is uncovered, revealing a wavy wig. Chico had already started going bald when the brothers appeared in their first Broadway production, ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'', in 1924. All of the Brothers' natural receding-hairline patterns were similar, but Harpo and Chico covered theirs with wigs (Groucho later sported an obvious [[toupee]] in the films ''[[At The Circus]]'' and ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'').\n\n==Soundtrack==\nBreaking with their usual pattern, neither Harpo's [[harp]] nor Chico's [[piano]] is used in the film, although Harpo briefly pretends to play harp on the strings of a piano, strumming chords in accompaniment to a duck-shaped music box that is playing.\n\nThe musical introduction to Groucho's character is similar to those in ''Animal Crackers'' and ''Horse Feathers'' but it did not become closely associated with him as did \"[[Hooray for Captain Spaulding]]\" from ''Animal Crackers''.\n\nZeppo, playing according to [[James Agee]] \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\",<ref>{{cite book  | last = Adamson  | first = Joe  | title = Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers  | location= New York City| publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 1973  | isbn = 0671470728 }}</ref> sings with the group, including soloing the first few lines of the first song, \"When the Clock on the Wall Strikes 10\". He also sings with the others in \"Freedonia's Going to War\", filling out the four-cornered symmetry as the Brothers sing and dance in pairs during the number.<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite web  | last = Griffin  | first = Danel  | title = ''Duck Soup'' review  | work = Film as Art  | publisher = [[University of Alaska Southeast]]  | url = http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | archive-url = https://archive.today/20121203234711/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2012-12-03  | access-date = 2007-12-30  }}</ref>\n\n===Original songs by Kalmar and Ruby===\nThe \"Freedonia National Anthem\" is used frequently throughout the film, both as vocal and instrumental; the entire song seems to consist of \"Hail, Hail, Freedonia, land of the brave and free\", contrasting with the final line of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''. The \"Sylvania theme\", which sounds vaguely like \"[[Rule, Britannia!]]\", is also used several times. \"When The Clock On The Wall Strikes 10\", the first musical number in the film, is part of the same scene as \"Just Wait 'Til I Get Through With It\",<ref name=\"filmsite\"/> Groucho's song about the laws of his administration. \"This Country's Going To War\"<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=73717&category=Music Music]</ref> is the final musical ensemble in the film. Technically it is the only musical number in the Marx Brothers' films to feature all four of the brothers. However, in ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', Chico briefly bangs on the piano while the other three play saxophones while eluding their pursuers on an [[ocean liner]].\n\nThe introductory scene, showing ducks swimming in a kettle and quacking merrily, is scored with an instrumental medley of the aforementioned songs, and it is also the only scene in the film that has to do with ducks and soup.\n\n===Non-original music===\n* ''[[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|Military Polonaise]]'' ([[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]) \u2013 played over newspaper headline of Firefly's appointment as president of Freedonia\n* \"[[Hornpipe|Sailor's Hornpipe]]\"; \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" \u2013 short segments embedded in \"These Are the Laws of My Administration\"\n* \"[[Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf]]\" \u2013 music box, accompanied by Harpo on (simulated) harp, briefly; a few minutes later, in another scene, Groucho says \"I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your door in\" after he is locked in a closet.

Audiences were taken aback by such preposterous political disregard, buffoonery, and cynicism at a time of economic and political crisis.<ref name=\"silver\"/><ref name=\"filmsite\"/>  Film scholar [[Leonard Maltin]] had this to say in his book ''The Great Movie Comedians'':\n<blockquote>As wonderful as ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]'', ''[[Horse Feathers]]'', and ''Duck Soup'' seem today, some critics and moviegoers found them unpleasant and longed for the more orderly world of ''[[The Cocoanuts]]'' with its musical banalities. [...] Many right-thinkers laughed themselves silly in 1933\u2014but a large number didn't. [...] The unrelieved assault of Marxian comedy was simply too much for some people.<ref name=\"Maltin\">Maltin, pp. 135\u2013136</ref></blockquote>\n\nYears later, Groucho's son [[Arthur Marx]] described [[Irving Thalberg]]'s assessment of the film's purported failure during a [[National Public Radio]] interview:\n<blockquote>[Thalberg] said the trouble with ''Duck Soup'' is you've got funny gags in it, but there's no story and there's nothing to root for. You can't root for the Marx Brothers because they're a bunch of zany kooks.

When asked the significance of the film's politics, Groucho only shrugged and said: \"What significance? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh.\"<ref name=\"silver\"/>{{efn|[https://archive.today/20121212105659/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/Q&A.htm Danel Griffin] elaborates on this quote from Groucho at his website:<blockquote>I've always been on the fence about this one. In my write-up, of course, I argue that even if the Marxes didn't intend any deeper significance, one still exists that its longevity has created. And of course, it's impossible to tell when Groucho is being sarcastic and when he isn't. But that he communicated with [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]], etc., all who praised the Brothers' work, means that he was at least aware of the various readings of the film, and he engaged them on some level. I suspect that his outspoken opinion of ''Duck Soup'' simply changed over time. While the Brothers were still active, they were infamously embarrassed by the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] films\u2014hard to believe it, but there was a time when the Thalberg collaborations were actually considered better. Perhaps the 'four Jews trying to get a laugh' comment was a dismissive one he made towards that era in general. Towards the end of his lifetime, critics reexamined the Paramounts and embraced them, and perhaps this gave Groucho incentive to finally admit that the film indeed was an intentional, biting satire. But who knows? Part of the charm of the Marx Brothers is that it's impossible to know where they\u2019re channeling.</blockquote>}} Nevertheless, the Brothers were ecstatic when [[Benito Mussolini]] took the film as a personal insult and banned it in Italy.<ref name=\"filmsite\"/><ref name=\"Groucho\">Kanfer</ref>  Also, the residents of [[Fredonia, New York]], protested because they feared that the similar-sounding nation would hurt their city's reputation.
