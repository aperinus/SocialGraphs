He is sent to [[Central America]] by General Haynes to battle [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] insurgents, but a flaw develops in his programming and he develops a conscience and compassion. His developers try to take him back for deprogramming, but he flees to the [[jungle]] in a helicopter. His main energy supply was damaged during the first mission, forcing him to switch to his much less powerful secondary power. He joins a small village community that is under constant threat from guerilla attackers, and he protects them in exchange for use of their electric generator (they previously used it to power a television). There he learns to 'bluff' from a child that befriends him, Miguel.\n\nSolo helps the villagers drive off local Warlord Rio and his small army, but the combat is detected by a military satellite. A black ops team is sent to recover or destroy Solo, while they ally with Rio. The highly sadistic black ops leader, Colonel Frank Madden, who has an intense hatred for Solo as he sees Solo renders the Black Ops members like him out of job, brings in Dr. Bill Stewart, Solo's creator, as a lure, leaving the man mortally wounded but Solo survives. Having occupied the village, the militiamen and black ops team attempt to kill Solo, but he manages to kill them.\n\nRio is betrayed by Madden, who tries to kill Solo with an automatic grenade launcher. Solo is able to fight Madden in hand-to-hand combat and non-fatally break his spine. Suddenly a helicopter delivers a more powerful version of the android, which is armed with a multi-barreled gun and has Madden's face. The MkII kills Madden and proceeds to hunt down Solo. Solo rescues the villagers and destroys the MkII android, using his acquired bluffing skills. After the temple the two androids fought in collapses, causing the military to pull out believing both units are destroyed and unrecoverable, Miguel mourns Solo believing he was destroyed by cave-in, but Miguel starts to hear Solo, laughing, as he knows he has earned his freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Solo\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Colonel Frank Madden / Improved Solo\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Dr. Bill Stewart\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as General Clyde Haynes\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Rio\n* [[Jaime Gomez]] as Sergeant Lorenzo\n* [[Seidy L\u00f3pez]] as Agela\n* Abraham Verduzco as Miguel\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Garrido]] as Vasquez\n* [[Jaime P.
