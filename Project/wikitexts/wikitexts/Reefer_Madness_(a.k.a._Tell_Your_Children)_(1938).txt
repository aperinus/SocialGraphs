While this is all happening they suffer [[hallucinations]], descend into [[insanity]], associate with organized crime and (in one character's case) commit [[suicide]]. The film was directed by [[Louis J. Gasnier]] and featured a cast of mainly little-known actors.\n\nOriginally financed by a church group under the title ''Tell Your Children,'' the film was intended to be shown to parents as a [[morality tale]] attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use.<ref name=\"History\"/> Soon after the film was shot, it was purchased by producer [[Dwain Esper]], who re-cut the film for distribution on the [[exploitation film]] circuit, exploiting vulgar interest while escaping censorship under the guise of moral guidance, beginning in 1938\u20131939 through the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe film was \"rediscovered\" in the early 1970s and gained new life as an unintentional satire among advocates of [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|cannabis policy reform]].<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book |last=Peary |first=Danny |title=Cult Movies |year=1981 |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |isbn=0440016266 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cultmoviesclassi0000pear/page/203 203\u2013205]|title-link=Cult Movies (book) }}</ref> Critics have called it [[List of films considered the worst#Reefer Madness (1936)|one of the worst films ever made]] and has gained a [[cult following]] within [[cannabis culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1936/Reefer+Madness|work=[[AMC (TV channel)]] |access-date=November 17, 2013 |title= Reefer Madness (1936)}}</ref><ref name=\"Stemme\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/04/magazine/tm-letters36.1 |date=September 4, 2005 |last=Stemme |first=Joe |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=November 17, 2013 |title=What's the Worst Movie Ever?}}</ref> Today, it is in the [[public domain]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Peary\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nMae Coleman and Jack Perry are a cohabitating couple who sell marijuana. The unscrupulous Jack sells the drug to teenagers over Mae's objections; she'd rather stick to an adult clientele. Ralph Wiley, a sociopathic college dropout turned dealer, and siren Blanche help Jack recruit new customers. Ralph and Jack lure high school student Bill Harper and college student Jimmy Lane to Mae and Jack's apartment. Jimmy takes Bill to a party where Jack runs out of reefer, and Jimmy, who has a car, drives him to pick up more. When they get to Jack's boss' \"headquarters\", Jimmy asks for a cigarette as Jack gets out and he gives him a joint. By the time Jack returns, Jimmy is unknowingly high; he [[Cannabis and impaired driving|drives away recklessly]] and hits a pedestrian. A few days later, Jack tells Jimmy that the man died of his injuries and agrees to keep Jimmy's name out of the case{{snd}}if Jimmy will agree to \"forget he was ever in Mae's apartment.\" As the police did not have enough specific details to track Jimmy down, he indeed escapes punishment.\n\n[[File:ReeferMadness 14.jpg|275 px|thumb|left|Ralph is arrested for Jack's murder.]]\nBill, whose once-pristine record at school has rapidly declined, has a fling with Blanche while high. Mary, Jimmy's sister and Bill's girlfriend, goes to Mae's apartment looking for Jimmy and accepts a joint from Ralph, thinking it's a regular cigarette. When she refuses Ralph's advances, he tries to rape her. Bill comes out of the bedroom and, still high, hallucinates that Mary is willingly offering herself to Ralph and attacks the latter. As the two are fighting, Jack knocks Bill unconscious with the butt of his gun, which inadvertently fires, killing Mary. Jack puts the gun in Bill's hand, framing him for Mary's death by claiming he [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blacked out]].  The dealers lie low for a while in Blanche's apartment while Bill's trial takes place. Over the objections of a skeptical juror, Bill is found guilty.\n\nBy now Ralph is paranoid from both marijuana and his guilty conscience. Blanche is also high; at one memorable point she plays the piano more and more rapidly as Ralph eggs her on. The boss tells Jack to shoot Ralph to prevent him from confessing, but when Jack arrives, Ralph immediately recognizes the threat and beats him to death with a stick as Blanche [[pseudobulbar affect|laughs uncontrollably in terror]]. The police arrest Ralph, Mae, and Blanche. Mae's confession leads to the boss and other gang members also being arrested. Blanche explains that Bill was innocent and agrees to serve as a material witness for the case against Ralph, but instead, she jumps out of a window and falls to her death, traumatized by her own adultery and its role in Mary's death. Bill's conviction is overturned, and Ralph, now nearly [[catatonia|catatonic]], is sent to an asylum for the criminally insane for the rest of his natural life.\n\nThe film's story is told in [[Inclusio|bracketing]] sequences at a lecture given at a [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] meeting by high school principal Dr. Alfred Carroll. At the film's end he tells the parents he has been told that events similar to those he has described are likely to happen again, then points to random parents in the audience and warns that \"the next tragedy may be that of your daughter... or your son... or yours or yours...\" before [[Breaking the fourth wall|pointing straight at the camera]] and saying emphatically \"... or ''yours''!\" as the words \"TELL YOUR CHILDREN\" appear on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Reefer Madness.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Reefer Madness'']]\n[[File:Reefer madness1938.webm|thumb|thumbtime=2|''Reefer Madness'', 1938 release]]\n* [[Dorothy Short]] as Mary Lane\n* Kenneth Craig as Bill Harper\n* [[Lillian Miles]] as Blanche\n* [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] as Ralph Wiley\n* [[Thelma White]] as Mae Coleman\n* [[Carleton Young]] as Jack Perry\n* Warren McCollum as Jimmy Lane\n* Pat Royale as Agnes\n* Josef Forte as Dr. Alfred Carroll\n* Harry Harvey Jr. as Junior Harper\n* [[Richard Alexander (actor)|Richard Alexander]] as Pete Daly, Pusher (uncredited)\n* [[Lester Dorr]] as Joe \u2013 Bartender (uncredited)\n* [[Edward LeSaint]] as The Judge (uncredited)\n* [[Forrest Taylor]] as Blanche's Lawyer (uncredited)\n\n==Production and history==\n[[File:ReeferMadness 13.jpg|left|thumb|\"If you want a good smoke, try one of these.\"]]\nIn 1936 or 1938,<ref name=howell>{{cite web |url=http://www.november.org/stayinfo/breaking2/Madness.html |title=Nip Reefer In The Bud |work=The Toronto Star |author=Peter Howell |date=April 15, 2004 |access-date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> ''Tell Your Children'' was financed and made by a church group and intended to be shown to parents as a morality tale attempting to teach them about the dangers of cannabis use.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reefer-madness-movie.com/history.html |title=The history of ''Reefer Madness'' |access-date=2006-11-07 |last1 =Murphy |first1=Kevin |last2=Studney |first2=Dan |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20060328163318/http://www.reefer-madness-movie.com/history.html |archive-date=2006-03-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"Peary\"/> It was originally produced by [[George Hirliman]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/87909/Tell-Your-Children/full-credits.html |title=Tell Your Children (full credits) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] (via [[American Film Institute]] catalog) |access-date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> however, some time after the film was made, it was purchased by [[exploitation film]]maker [[Dwain Esper]], who inserted salacious shots.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 1938<ref name=pdreview/><ref name=tcmopi/> or 1939,<ref name=mathijs/><ref name=senn/> Esper began distributing it on the exploitation circuit<ref name=\"History\"/> where it was originally released in at least four territories, each with their own title for the film:<ref name=peter/> the first territory to screen it was the South, where it went by ''Tell Your Children'' (1938 or 1939).<ref name=povrow/> West of Denver, Colorado, the film was generally known as ''Doped Youth'' (1940).<ref name=povrow/> In New England, it was known as ''Reefer Madness'' (1940<ref name=povrow>{{cite web |url=http://monsterkidclassichorrorforum.yuku.com/topic/37115/REEFER-MADNESS-questions |title=Reefer Madness Questions |work=Poverty Row Horrors |date=April 3, 2011 |access-date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> or 1947),<ref name=howell/> while in the Pennsylvania/West Virginia territory it was called ''The Burning Question'' (1940).<ref name=peter>{{cite web |url=http://petersmovieposters.com/index-trade-30s-3.html |title=1930-1945 |work=Peter's Movie Posters |access-date=December 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219212134/http://petersmovieposters.com/index-trade-30s-3.html |archive-date=December 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name=povrow/> The film was then screened all over the country during the 1940s under these various titles and Albert Dezel of Detroit eventually bought all rights in 1951 for use in [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow screenings]] throughout the 1950s.<ref name=povrow/>\n\nSuch education-exploitation films were common in the years following adoption of the stricter version of the [[Production Code]] in 1934.
