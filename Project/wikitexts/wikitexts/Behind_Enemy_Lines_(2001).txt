The film tells the story of [[Lieutenant (US Navy)|Lieutenant]] Chris Burnett, an American [[naval flight officer]] who is shot down over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and uncovers [[Bosnian genocide|genocide]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. Meanwhile, his commanding officer is struggling to gain approval to launch a [[combat search and rescue]] mission to save Burnett. The plot is loosely based on the 1995 [[Mrkonji\u0107 Grad incident]] that occurred during the war.<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,338983,00.html |title=Plane Truth: Downed airman sues over \"Behind Enemy Lines\"|date=August 20, 2002| last =Susman |first = Gary|access-date=August 22, 2009 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\nReleased on November 30, 2001, ''Behind Enemy Lines'' received generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a considerable box office success, taking in nearly $92 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. The film started a franchise of [[direct-to-video]] [[spiritual successor]]s: ''[[Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil]]'', ''[[Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia]]'', and ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]]'', with the third film being co-produced by [[WWE Studios]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], [[United States Navy]] flight officer Lieutenant Chris Burnett and pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse are stationed on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Carl Vinson}} in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Burnett is preparing to leave the Navy, and clashes with his [[commanding officer]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] Leslie Reigart. On Christmas, Reigart assigns Burnett and Stackhouse to fly an [[aerial reconnaissance]] mission, which goes smoothly until they spot unusual activity in the [[demilitarized zone]]. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] off-course for a closer look, unaware that they are photographing [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] soldiers burying massacred [[Bosniak]] civilians in [[mass graves]]. The local [[Republika Srpska (1992\u201395)|Bosnian Serb]] paramilitary commander, General Miroslav Lokar, is conducting a secret [[Bosnian genocide|genocidal campaign]] against the [[Bosniak]] population, and orders the jet be shot down.\n\nAttempting to outmaneuver Lokar's [[surface-to-air missiles]], Burnett and Stackhouse's jet is hit, forcing them to [[Ejection seat|eject]]. Lokar and his men find the injured Stackhouse, who is executed by Sasha Ivanic, one of Lokar's right-hand men. Watching nearby, Burnett flees into the wilderness, and Lokar orders his deputy, Colonel Bazda, and Sasha to hunt him down. Burnett radios for help and receives an [[extraction (military)|extraction point]] from Reigart, who is forced to stand down after Admiral Piquet, the commander of [[Allied Maritime Command|NATO naval forces]] in the region, warns him that rescuing Burnett in the demilitarized zone risks derailing the peace process. Burnett reaches the extraction point only to be informed that he must continue to another location, miles outside the demilitarized zone, in order to be rescued.\n\nSpotting Bazda's patrol, Burnett falls into a mass grave, and hides under a dead body until the Serbs move on. To ensure Burnett's rescue, Reigart [[News leak|leaks news]] of the downed jet to [[Sky News]], angering Piquet. Lokar realizes that the American jet's [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] with the incriminating photographs may still be in the wreckage. Heading to the new extraction point, Burnett escapes Serb soldiers through a [[Land mine|minefield]]. Pursued by Sasha, he encounters Bosniak [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] who offer him a ride to the town of Ha\u010d, which turns out to be a war zone. After the battle, Serb troops believe they have found Burnett's body, but Sasha realizes Burnett switched uniforms with a dead Serb guerrilla and escaped. The Serbs present the corpse wearing Burnett's uniform to the media, convincing [[Implementation Force|NATO forces]] that Burnett has been killed, and the mission to rescue him is aborted just as he reaches the extraction point.\n\nRealizing why the Serbs shot him down, Burnett remembers a statue of an angel near where his ejection seat landed, and returns to find it. He reactivates the seat's [[Emergency locator beacon|rescue beacon]], notifying his [[Carrier battle group|carrier group]] that he is still alive, but also alerting the Serbs to his location. Knowing he risks being relieved of command, Reigart prepares a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] task force to rescue Burnett, in defiance of Piquet's orders. On the way to kill Burnett and recover his body, Bazda steps on a landmine; Sasha abandons him to his fate, and the explosion alerts Burnett that someone is approaching. Sasha finds the ejection seat, but is ambushed by Burnett, who, despite taking a shot in the arm, fatally stabs him with the spike of a [[Flare#Fusee|railroad flare]]. Lokar arrives with armored vehicles and infantry, but is held off by Reigart's task force. Retrieving the hard drive, Burnett is successfully rescued, much to the dismay of Lokar as his crime is now being exposed.\n\nThe photographs of the mass grave lead to Lokar's arrest and conviction for [[war crime]]s including genocide. Reigart's actions result in him being relieved of command and retiring from service, and Burnett continues his career in the Navy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Navy Pilot Lieutenant Chris \"Longhorn\" Burnett\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Rear Admiral Leslie McMahon Reigart\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Navy Pilot Lieutenant Jeremy \"Smoke\" Stackhouse\n* [[Charles Malik Whitfield]] as Marine Captain Glen Rodway\n* [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as Master Chief Tom O'Malley\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Serb General Miroslav Lokar\n* [[Joaquim de Almeida]] as Admiral Juan Miguel Piquet\n* [[Vladimir Mashkov]] as Serb Sniper Sasha Ivanic\n* Marko Igonda as Serb Colonel Viktor Bazda\n* [[Eyal Podell]] as Petty Officer Kennedy\n* [[Laurence Mason]] as Captain Glen Brandon\n* [[Leon Russom]] as Ed Burnett\n* [[Geoff Pierson]] as Admiral Donnelly\n* Vladimir Oktasec as Serb President Petrovic\n* Salaetin Bilal as Muslim Guerilla Leader Ejup\n* Kamil Koll\u00e1rik as Muslim Guerilla Babi\u0107\n* [[Aernout van Lynden]] as Himself\n\n==Production== \nThe film was shot at the Koliba Studios in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] and on location in the Slovakian village of [[H\u00e1j, Ko\u0161ice-okolie District|H\u00e1j]] (in the village of H\u00e1j there is also a prop of an angel from the film).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.planetslovakia.sk/zaujimavosti/17-anjel-v-haji|title=Anjel v obci H\u00e1j (rekvizita z filmu Za nepriate\u013eskou l\u00edniou) 31 March 2016 Slovak language|accessdate=Jul 16, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USS|Carl Vinson}} was the aircraft carrier featured in the film.

He survived for six days before being rescued by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. O'Grady, who later became a children's author and motivational speaker, filed suit against both the producers of ''Behind Enemy Lines'' as well as ''Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O\u2019Grady Story'', a 1998 documentary that [[Discovery Channel]] aired on his experience, for [[defamation]] of character, accusing the film's producers of invasion of privacy through the misappropriation of his name, likeness and identity, false representation and false advertising, and contending that those involved in both works produced them without his permission, and that the commercial value of his name was damaged by them. O'Grady's complaint indicated that among other things, he was troubled by the disobedience and profanity exhibited by the feature film's main character. O'Grady also accused Fox of using the documentary to promote the feature film and making a film about his ordeal without his permission. The film's characters and events differ from O'Grady's experience; he never entered populated areas, nor did he interact with civilians, and did not engage in direct combat with enemy soldiers. Also, O'Grady never flew an F/A-18F but rather an [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly/><ref>{{cite news|title=Pilot sues over Bosnian escape film|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, England|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2205560.stm|date=August 20, 2002|access-date=June 8, 2011}}</ref> The case was settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|first=Sarah|last=Hall|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/46666/behind-enemy-lines-suit-settled |title=Behind Enemy Lines Suit Settled |website=[[E!
