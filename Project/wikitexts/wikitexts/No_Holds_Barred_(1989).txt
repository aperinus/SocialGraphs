Wright, written by Dennis Hackin and starring professional wrestler [[Hulk Hogan]] (who is billed as executive producer alongside [[Vince McMahon]]). It is owned by [[WWE]] under a \"Shane Distribution Company\" copyright and was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on June 2, 1989. Released seven years after his appearance in ''[[Rocky III]]'', it was Hogan\u2019s first starring role.\n\n==Plot==\nRip Thomas is the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] [[WWE Championship|Heavyweight Champion]], and his appearances on network television have been a thorn in the side of Mr. Brell, the head of the struggling World Television Network. Rip is a huge ratings draw while WTN is the lowest rated television network. The day after Rip's most recent title match against Jake Bullet, Brell attempts to get Rip to become a part of his network but he refuses. Angry at being stood up by a man he considers a \u201cjock ass\u201d, Brell tries to exact revenge by hiring his goons to jump Rip in the limo to no avail as Rip fights off his goons.\n\nLater, Brell visits the No Count Bar, where he comes up with his own wrestling program called ''Battle of the Tough Guys''. The show is successful due to the introduction of Zeus, an ex-convict and former protege of Rip's trainer, Charlie. Zeus wins the $100,000 tournament and becomes Brell's prized fighter.\n\nSamantha Moore, a corporate spy, is sent by Brell to seduce Rip. However, Rip's good nature and dedication to charity win her over, and she confesses her identity to the wrestler and turns to his side. Brell learns of Samantha's defection and, vowing revenge, sends his underlings to kidnap and rape her. Rip stops the would-be rapist, throwing one of the stooges into a tree trunk.\n\nLater, Rip is at a charity event when Brell and Zeus arrive, demanding that Rip prove his honor by fighting Zeus on ''Battle of the Tough Guys.'' Rip, wanting to set a good example and knowing children are around, declines. Meanwhile, Rip's younger brother Randy and his friend, Craig, decide to check out Zeus for themselves, attending an illegal fight being held in a warehouse. After watching Zeus defeat the monstrous Rebar Lawless, Craig identifies Randy as Rip's brother to Brell and his associates. Randy attempts to defend himself but Zeus brutally beats him, sending him to the hospital. Enraged, Rip accepts Zeus' challenge to avenge his brother.\n\nOn the night of the match, Brell has Samantha kidnapped and orders Rip to go ten minutes through the fight then lose the fight to save her life. As the battle begins, Samantha escapes, but just as Brell's goons corner her, Charlie and Craig rescue her and defeat the bad guys. Back in the arena, Zeus has the upper hand at the start of the fight, ruthlessly pummeling Rip, even attempting to kill him by ripping out one of the steel posts and trying to impale him through the chest. Randy cheers to urge his brother to fight back. Rip is re-energized by Randy's words and once he sees Samantha is safe, gains a second wind and starts to turn the tides on Zeus. The fight destroys the ring, with Rip and Zeus continuing the battle up the through the stands as Brell watches from the control room.\n\nRip finally puts an end to the match by knocking Zeus off a catwalk and through the ring far below. A frustrated Brell begins destroying electrical equipment, enraged over Zeus' loss. Rip angrily goes after Brell intending to repay him for his misdeeds. Brell retreats, but accidentally comes in contact with live wires he has exposed in his tirade and is electrocuted. With their enemies vanquished, Rip and Randy celebrate victory with friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hulk Hogan]] as Rip Thomas\n* [[Joan Severance]] as Samantha Moore\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Tom Brell\n* [[Tommy Lister Jr.|Tiny Lister]] as Zeus\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Randy Thomas\n* [[Bill Henderson (actor)|Bill Henderson]] as Charlie\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]] as Ordway\n* [[David Paymer]] as Unger\n* Patrick O'Bryan as Craig\n* [[Robert Swenson|Jeep Swenson]] as \"Lugwrench\" Perkins\n* [[Bill Eadie]] as Jake Bullet\n* [[Stan Hansen]] as Neanderthal\n* Rebecca Wackler as Ms. Tidings\n* Bruce Taylor as Mr. Johnson\n* [[Gene Okerlund]] as Himself\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] as Himself\n* [[Howard Finkel]] as Himself\n* [[Joey Marella]] as Himself\n* Rick Allen as Unnamed Wrestler\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], and [[LaserDisc]] in October 1989.

He may one day want to try ''[[Hamlet]]'' and I can see the billing now: Hulk Hogan vs. Felonious Polonius.\n\nBut, from what I hope is a safe distance, let me point out a few things about Hulk's work in ''No Holds Barred''.

His sober speaking voice outside of the ring does not match his wild roars when doing battle. The amused gleam in his eye hints at a canny intelligence behind the sinew and sweat. And his exaggeratedly stagy bouts make only a token attempt to look real. More than Sylvester Stallone or [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Mr. Hogan behaves like a self-invented [[Comic book|comic-book]] character sprung to life.\n\n''No Holds Barred,'' which opened yesterday at the [[Criterion Theatre (New York)|Criterion 1]] and other local theaters, is as cartoonish as its star.<ref>{{cite news | date = June 3, 1989 | first=Stephen | last=Holden | title = The Ferocious Hulk Hogan and Other Tough Guys | work = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/03/movies/review-film-the-ferocious-hulk-hogan-and-other-tough-guys.html }}</ref>}}\n\nReviewing the Blu-ray in 2014, Felix Vasquez Jr. of ''Cinema Crazed'' wrote: \"Hogan as The Ripper is a force of nature here, and he makes \"No Holds Barred\" in to a fun action cartoon.\"<ref>{{cite web | date = April 14, 2014 | author = Felix Vasquez Jr. | work = Cinema Crazed | title = No Holds Barred (1989) [Blu-Ray] | url = http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2014/04/14/no-holds-barred-1989-blu-ray/ }}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n===No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie===\n{{Infobox Wrestling event\n| name= No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie\n| image= No Holds Barred 1989 .jpg\n| promotion= [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]\n| date= December 12, 1989\n| date_aired= December 27, 1989\n| venue= [[Nashville Municipal Auditorium]]\n| city= [[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n| lastevent= [[Survivor Series (1989)]]\n| nextevent= [[Royal Rumble (1990)]]\n}}\n{{main|No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie}}\n'''No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie''', as the event was billed, was shown on [[pay-per-view]] on December 27, 1989.

It is currently one of the few WWE pay-per-views not yet available on the [[WWE Network]].\n\n==== Background ====\nThe main event pitted Hogan and Lister \u2014 appearing in character as \"Zeus\" \u2014 on opposing tag teams. Hogan teamed with longtime friend [[Brutus Beefcake]], while the [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Zeus teamed with [[Randy Savage]]. The four had been involved in an intertwined feud since the summer. Zeus had made several appearances at WWF events and cut promos stating that he, and not Hogan, should have received top billing in ''No Holds Barred''. Meanwhile, as Hogan and Savage were feuding over the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]], Beefcake began feuding with Savage after Beefcake insulted Savage's manager [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]] during a TV taping. At the [[SummerSlam (1989)|1989 SummerSlam]], Hogan and Beefcake teamed to defeat Savage and Zeus, after which the tag team feud simmered for several months as Zeus began appearing with [[Ted DiBiase]] in the lead-up to [[Survivor Series (1989)|the 1989 Survivor Series]]. Unlike [[SummerSlam (1989)|1989 SummerSlam]], [[Miss Elizabeth]] did not make an appearance at this event.\n\nThe Hogan-Beefcake vs. Savage-Zeus tag team rivalry resumed after the Survivor Series, in the lead-up to \"No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie.\"\n\n====Results====\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n| times  = <ref name=\"pwh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#89|title=Royal Rumble 1989|access-date=2010-05-17|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>\n| dark1  = yes\n| match1 = [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] defeated [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]\n| stip1  = [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|Singles match]]\n| time1  = 9:23\n| dark2  = yes\n| match2 = [[The Ultimate Warrior]] (c) defeated [[Dino Bravo]]\n| stip2  = Singles match for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]]\n| time2  = 13:45\n| dark3  = yes\n| match3 = [[The Colossal Connection]] ([[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]]) defeated [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) (c) via [[countout]]\n| stip3  = Tag Team match for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]]\n| time3  = 10:02\n| dark4  = yes\n| match4 = [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] defeated [[Ron Garvin]]\n| stip4  = Singles match\n| time4  = 10:45\n| match5 = [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Brutus Beefcake]] defeated [[Randy Savage]] and [[Tom Lister Jr.|Zeus]] (with [[Sensational Sherri]])\n| stip5  = [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel cage match]]\n| time5  = 09:27\n}}\n\nThe Hogan-Beefcake vs. Savage-Zeus steel-cage match was part of a ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' taping. In addition to matches pitting mid- and lower-card wrestlers against jobbers, other contests (which were not televised) saw \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes defeat [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]], WWF Intercontinental Champion [[The Ultimate Warrior]] defeat [[Dino Bravo]], [[The Colossal Connection]] (Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Haku) defeat WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] by countout, and [[Curt Hennig]] defeat [[Ron Garvin]].\n\nHulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake defeated Randy Savage and Zeus in the 09:27-long [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel-cage match]]. The match could be won either by pinfall/submission or by having both members of a team escape the cage.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth match early on, all four competitors were knocked out after Hogan hit a suplex on Zeus, and Beefcake and Savage hit each other's heads into the cage structure. Sensational Sherri (the manager of the Savage-Zeus team) handed a chain to Savage, who attempted to strike Beefcake with a fist drop off the top of the cage, but Beefcake recovered and caught Savage coming off. Eventually, Beefcake knocked Savage to the mat and escaped the cage; Savage\u2014with some eventual help from Beefcake\u2014crawled outside, tying the match at 1-apiece.\n\nMeanwhile, Hogan rallied against Zeus, battering him before dropping three leg drops to score the pin and the win for the Hogan-Beefcake team.\n\n====Aftermath====\nThis was Zeus' last match in the WWF, as Lister left shortly afterward; meanwhile, Savage continued to target Hogan, and later, [[The Ultimate Warrior]], over the WWF Championship. Zeus (as Z-Gangsta) and Hogan would eventually face each other again in the main event at [[WCW]]'s [[Uncensored (1996)]] with Savage this time partnering Hogan, in a two-versus-eight [[Professional wrestling match types#Triple Cage match|Doomsday Cage match]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/uncensored.htm  |title=Uncensored |website=thehistoryofwwe.com}}</ref>\n\nAmong the dark matches, the Demolition-Colossal Connection match was contested one day prior to the match where the Colossal Connection won the WWF Tag Team Championship, while Dino Bravo continued to be the Ultimate Warrior's top foe for the Intercontinental Championship.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0097987}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|no_holds_barred|No Holds Barred}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708154223/http://www.cinemaconn.com/reviews-2/2006/09/18/no-holds-barred/ Cinema Connoisseur review]\n* [http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/no-holds-barred Review of ''No Holds Barred'' with animated screenshots] at I-Mockery\n\n[[Category:1989 action films]]\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 in professional wrestling]]\n[[Category:American action films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kansas]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
