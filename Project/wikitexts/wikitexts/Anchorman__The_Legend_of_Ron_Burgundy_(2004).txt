He works alongside his friends, whom he had known since childhood, on the news team: lead [[Correspondent|field reporter]] Brian Fantana, [[Sports commentator|sportscaster]] Champ Kind, and [[Weather presenter|meteorologist]] Brick Tamland. Station director Ed Harken informs the team that they have retained their long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party, where Burgundy unsuccessfully attempts to [[Courtship|pick up]] a beautiful blonde woman, Veronica Corningstone. Harken later informs the team that they [[Affirmative action|have been forced to hire]] Corningstone. After a series of unsuccessful attempts by the team to seduce her, she finally relents and agrees to a \"professional tour\" of the city with Ron, culminating in a sexual relationship. Despite agreeing to keep the relationship discreet, Burgundy announces it on air.\n\nAfter a dispute with a motorcyclist ends in Burgundy's dog Baxter being punted off the [[San Diego\u2013Coronado Bridge]], Burgundy is late to work. Corningstone fills in for him on-air, receiving higher ratings than Burgundy usually receives, and the couple breaks up when Burgundy bemoans her success. Corningstone is promoted to co-anchor, to the disgust of the team. The co-anchors become fierce rivals off-air while maintaining a phony cordiality on-air. Depressed, the team (barring Corningstone) decide to buy new suits, but Tamland, who was leading the way, gets them lost in a shady part of town. Confronted by main competitor Wes Mantooth and his news team, Burgundy challenges them to a fight. When several other news teams converge onsite, a full-on melee battle ensues, only to be broken up by police sirens that cause them to flee. Realizing that having a female co-anchor is straining their reputation, Burgundy gets in another heated argument with Veronica, and they get in a physical fight after she insults his hair.\n\nAfter one of Corningstone's co-workers informs her that Burgundy will read anything written on the [[teleprompter]], she sneaks into the station and changes the text in revenge. The next day, Burgundy (unaware of what he is saying) concludes the broadcast with \"Go fuck yourself, San Diego!\", instead of his signature closing line, \"You stay classy, San Diego!\", triggering an angry mob outside the studio and forcing Harken to fire Burgundy. Realizing she went too far, Corningstone attempts to apologize but Burgundy angrily dismisses her apology. Burgundy soon becomes unemployed, friendless, and heavily antagonized by the public, grows depressed, and begins to neglect his duties while Veronica enjoys fame, although her male co-workers work with her grudgingly.\n\nThree months later, when a [[panda]] is about to give birth, every news team in San Diego rushes to the zoo to cover the story. In an attempt to sabotage her, a rival news anchor pushes Corningstone into a [[Kodiak bear]] enclosure. When Ed is unable to locate Veronica, he recruits and rehires Burgundy. Once at the zoo, Burgundy, his personal morale restored, jumps in the bear pen to save Veronica, as the public watches helplessly. The news team then jump in to save Ron and Veronica. Just as a bear is about to attack, Baxter, who miraculously survived, intervenes and encourages the bear to spare them. As the group climbs out of the pit, Wes appears and holds the ladder over the bear pit, threatening to drop Ron back in, and says that deep down he has always hated him, but then admits to Ron that he also respects him and pulls Ron out to safety.\n\nAfter Burgundy and Corningstone reconcile, it is shown that in years to come, Fantana becomes the host of a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] reality show named ''Intercourse Island'', Tamland is married with 11 children and is a top political adviser to [[George W. Bush]], Kind is a commentator for the [[National Football League|NFL]] before getting fired after being accused by [[Terry Bradshaw]] of [[sexual harassment]], and Burgundy and Corningstone are co-anchors for the [[CNN]]-esque ''World News Center''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Will Ferrell]] as Ron Burgundy \u2013 Anchorman for a small news station in San Diego called KVWN Channel 4.\n*[[Christina Applegate]] as Veronica Corningstone \u2013 Intelligent news anchor beside Ron Burgundy for KVWN Channel 4.\n*[[Paul Rudd]] as Brian Fantana \u2013 Friend, anchorman, and coworker of Ron Burgundy.
