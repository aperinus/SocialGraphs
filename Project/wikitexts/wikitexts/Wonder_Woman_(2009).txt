The plot of the film is loosely based on [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the character, specifically the [[Wonder Woman: Gods and Mortals|Gods and Mortals]] arc that started the character's second volume in 1987.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070623103614/http://www.newsarama.com/movies/DCanimated/WWmovie.html DC Comics promotional document published by Newsarama]</ref> It is the fourth film of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] released by [[Warner Premiere]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].\n\nThe film is directed by [[Lauren Montgomery]], who directed the second act of ''[[Superman: Doomsday|The Death of Superman]]'' and did [[storyboard]] work for ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'', written by [[Gail Simone]] and Michael Jelenic. As with all previous releases in this line of films, it is produced by acclaimed DC Comics animation veteran [[Bruce Timm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/dcuam/wonderwoman/ |title=The World's Finest \u2013 DC Universe \u2013 Wonder Woman |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n\nOn August 11, 2015, Warner Home Video re-released the film on a combo pack, which includes a DVD and Blu-ray copy, a digital copy, and with the graphic novel it was based on.\n\n==Plot==\nIn ancient times, the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], a fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], battle [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta beheads her son [[Thrax (mythology)|Thrax]], whom Ares [[rape|forcibly conceived]] with her and who fought for his father. She is about to kill Ares, when Zeus stops her. Instead, [[Hera]] bounds his powers with magic bracers. They deprive him of his ability to draw power from the violence and death he can instigate. In compensation for their years of servitude to Ares, the Amazons are granted the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], where they remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man, holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Hippolyta is also granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shapes from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gives life with her own blood.\n\nOver a millennium later, Diana is unsatisfied with her life on Themyscira and longs to explore the outside world. An American fighter pilot, [[Colonel]] [[Steve Trevor]], is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his plane on the island. He then meets Diana, starting a fight in which he is defeated and taken to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy and as such, their tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but her mother argues that she hasn't enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana is instead assigned to guard Ares' cell; her bookish but kind-hearted best friend Alexa offers to cover for her. Defying her mother, Diana covers her face with a helmet and participates in contests of strength, ultimately winning the right to escort Trevor home.\n\nIn the meantime, the Amazon Persephone, seduced by Ares, kills Alexa and releases him. Diana brings Trevor in his repaired and now invisible jet to New York City, where he volunteers to help Diana capture Ares. An investigation uncovers a pattern of violence created by Ares' presence. The pair goes out to a bar and, after some heavy drinking, Trevor makes a pass at Diana. They argue outside, but are attacked by the demigod [[Deimos and Phobos (DC Comics)|Deimos]]. Diana subdues Deimos, who kills himself to avoid interrogation. His death leads Diana and Steve to a concealed gateway to the underworld guarded by members of a still-extant ancient cult of Ares.\n\nOnce they have arrived, Diana attempts to take Ares down, but he summons [[Harpy|harpies]] that attack her, prompting Trevor to save her. Meanwhile, Ares performs a sacrificial ritual that opens a gate to the Underworld, where he persuades his uncle [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]] to remove the bracers. Hades agrees, but does not tell his nephew that the ultimate cost of removing them would be his own death in combat. Later, Diana wakes up in a hospital, furious that Trevor saved her instead of stopping Ares. Trevor defends his actions, revealing how much he cares about her in the process.\n\nAres and his dark army attack [[Washington, D.C.]]; Trevor and Diana arrive to battle him and are soon joined by the Amazons. Ares manages to summon the Amazons long dead from the Underworld to fight their own sisters, but Alexa, a member of the undead host, reveals to her sister Artemis a chant which nullifies Ares's control. The undead then turn on Ares, but are destroyed by his powers; before passing on, Alexa makes peace with her older sister. Hippolyta kills Persephone in combat. With her dying breath, Persephone declares that by shutting the Amazons away from the world of Man, Hippolyta has denied them the happiness that comes with love and a family.\n\nMeanwhile, Ares' influence reaches the [[President of the United States]], who orders a nuclear missile against Themyscira, assuming the island is the source of the attack on Washington. This act of supreme aggression increases Ares's power, but Trevor takes the invisible jet and shoots down the missile just before it hits the island. After taking a brutal beating at Ares' hands, Diana finally outmaneuvers and beheads him. Trevor arrives back at the scene, Diana finally accepts him, and the two share a kiss. Ares is later condemned to the underworld to attend Hades as a slave.\n\nOn Themyscira, in memory of Alexa, Artemis takes up reading. Realizing that Diana misses both the outside world and Trevor, Hippolyta gives her the task of being a channel for \"communication between men and women\". Diana accepts and returns to New York, where she enjoys the company of Trevor and becomes the newly christened [[Wonder Woman]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keri Russell]] as [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]]\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as [[Steve Trevor]]\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]]\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as [[Hera]]\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]]\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]\n* Skye Arens as Little Girl\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as [[Deimos and Phobos (DC Comics)|Deimos]] ''(credited)'', Homeless Man ''(uncredited)''\n* Julianne Grossman as [[Etta Candy]]\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Persephone\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]]\n* [[Jason C.
