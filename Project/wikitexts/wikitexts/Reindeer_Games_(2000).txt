It stars [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[James Frain]], [[Donal Logue]], [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Clarence Williams III]].\n\n''Reindeer Games'' was released by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] on February 25, 2000. It received generally negative critical reception and was a [[box office bomb|box office failure]], grossing $32 million against a budget of $42 million.\n\n==Plot==\nPrison cellmates Nick Cassidy and Rudy Duncan are two days from release. Nick has been exchanging letters with a young woman named Ashley Mercer, although they have never met. Nick plans to meet Ashley as soon as he is released, while Rudy wants to join his family for Christmas. During a fight between the prisoners, Nick is killed while protecting Rudy. Upon release, Rudy pretends to be Nick in order to meet Ashley. They go to a diner then have sex in a cabin.\n\nThe two are kidnapped by Gabriel, Ashley\u2019s gang leader brother. He tells Rudy that the gang, composed of Pug, Merlin, and Jumpy, are planning to rob a casino where Nick used to work before going to prison. Rudy protests that he is not Nick, but Ashley reveals that she wrote to him knowing Gabriel would use him for the robbery. Realizing that the gang will likely kill him if they find out he knows nothing about the casino, Rudy resumes the ruse.\n\nRudy devises a robbery plan based on Nick\u2019s prison cell stories, and tells Gabriel the biggest loot is in the \"PowWow safe\" in manager Jack Bangs's office. Gabriel wants Rudy to draw a map of the casino, but Rudy claims that the casino has been remodeled. At the casino Rudy, dressed as a cowboy, snoops around to see any changes, and is almost caught by Jack Bangs but escapes by switching clothes with a college student. Merlin discovers that the casino was never remodeled and has been the same since it opened. Rudy runs with Ashley to a frozen lake pursued by Gabriel and his thugs shooting at them. Ashley falls through the ice and Rudy jumps in to rescue her. The thugs pull them out and are seen by an ice fisherman, whom Gabriel kills.\n\nGabriel throws darts at Rudy to get some answers and rants about his life as a truck driver. He decides to give Rudy a second chance at drawing the map. Later, Rudy stumbles upon Gabriel and Ashley in the pool area and learns they are not siblings, but lovers. The casino robbery doesn't go according to plan due to the inaccurate details of Rudy's map. Pug is killed in the count room.\n\nEveryone meets in the manager's office. Gabriel introduces Rudy to Jack as Nick, but the manager recognizes him only as the cowboy from earlier and not as Nick. Gabriel, furious at Rudy\u2019s deception, spares him for a moment when he demands to know where the \"PowWow\" safe is. When Jack opens the safe, he grabs guns from inside and kills Jumpy as the rest flee. Jack dies during the shootout while Rudy kills Merlin. Rudy is grabbed out the back door by Gabriel and Ashley who tie him up in their 18-wheeler truck.\n\nThe two plan to drive Rudy off the cliff in a burning car with some of the money, so it will be assumed the stolen money had been burned. Ashley shoots and kills Gabriel, then Nick appears, having staged his death earlier. Ashley's real name is revealed to be Millie Bobeck, and she was aware of Rudy's identity the whole time. Millie and Nick had collaborated to rob the casino using Rudy, Gabriel, and the gang. They tie Rudy to the steering wheel. Rudy produces a knife he had gotten earlier, cuts his bindings, hot wires the car, and reverses it, crushing Nick's legs. Millie desperately tries to shoot him but Rudy rams the burning car into her. He dives out as the car and Millie go over the cliff. Nick tries to convince Rudy to share the money, but Rudy locks him in the truck and sends it over the cliff.\n\nRudy picks up the cash and begins distributing it in mailboxes on the way home to his family, where he joins them for Christmas dinner.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ben Affleck]] as Rudy Duncan / Nick Cassidy\n*[[Gary Sinise]] as Gabriel 'Monster' Mercer\n*[[Charlize Theron]] as Ashley Mercer / Millie Bobeck\n*[[Dennis Farina]] as Jack Bangs\n*[[James Frain]] as Nick Cassidy\n*[[Clarence Williams III]] as 'Merlin'\n*[[Donal Logue]] as 'Pug'\n*[[Danny Trejo]] as 'Jumpy'\n*[[Isaac Hayes]] as 'Zook'\n*[[Gordon Tootoosis]] as Old Governor\n*[[Dana Stubblefield]] as 'The Alamo'\n*[[Lonny Chapman]] as Old Timer\n}}\n\nIn addition, some brief appearances include [[Ashton Kutcher]], then starring in the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]'', as a college student, while [[Pornographic film actor|porn star]] [[Ron Jeremy]] (credited under his real name, Ron Hyatt) plays a prison inmate.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was set in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] but was shot in [[Vancouver]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia]], Canada.
