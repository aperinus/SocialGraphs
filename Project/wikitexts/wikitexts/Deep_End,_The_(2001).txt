Her husband is a pilot on the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']]. She is startled to discover that her son Beau ([[Jonathan Tucker]]), a high school senior, has been having a sexual affair with 30-year-old [[Reno|Reno, Nevada]], night club owner Darby Reese ([[Josh Lucas]]). Margaret visits Reese's nightclub, The Deep End, to demand that he stay away from her son. That night, Reese secretly visits Beau and the two meet in the boathouse. Beau confronts him about asking his mother for money. The two argue, eventually coming to blows. As Beau returns to the house, Reese leans on a railing, causing it to collapse, and falls into the water, impaling himself on an anchor.\n\nThe next morning, Margaret discovers Reese's body on the beach. Margaret removes the body and dumps it in a cove but it is soon discovered and the police investigate it as a homicide.  Soon after, a man named Alek Spera ([[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]]) confronts Margaret with a tape of Darby and Beau having sex. Alek demands $50,000 in 24 hours or he will turn the tape over to the police, which would implicate Beau in Reese's \"murder\".\n\nMargaret struggles unsuccessfully to get the money by selling all her jewels. Alek calls Margaret the next day and tells her that she needs to get only $25,000 but Alek's partner, Nagle ([[Raymond J. Barry]]) is convinced she is lying about not being able to raise the money. Nagle corners and beats Margaret but Alek arrives and the two men scuffle, and Alek strangles Nagle. Margaret attempts to take responsibility for Nagle's death, but Alek takes the body away in Nagle's car. As Margaret and her son drive looking for Nagle's car, they see it overturned in a ditch. Margaret attempts to free Alek, who is critically injured. Alek pleads with her to leave before the police arrive. Margaret stays until Alek dies. \n\nBack at home, Margaret, in a state of distress, is comforted by Beau. Another phone call is heard coming in from the absent husband, answered by Beau's sister. The Halls' normal life resumes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Margaret Hall\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Alek Spera\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Beau Hall\n* [[Peter Donat]] as Jack Hall\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Darby Reese\n* [[Raymond J.
