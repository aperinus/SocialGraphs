The story centres on young [[skinhead]]s in England in 1983. The film illustrates how their [[subculture]], which has its roots in 1960s [[West Indies]] culture, especially [[ska]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[reggae]] music,<ref name=\"autogenerated8\">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_38/ai_n6234788/pg_1 |work=Journal of Social History |title=Subcultures, pop music and politics: skinheads and \"Nazi rock\" in England and Germany |first=Timothy S. |last=Brown |year=2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081655/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_1_38/ai_n6234788/pg_1 |archive-date=5 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=A Stevens |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/apr/26/afreshcropofskinheadsimag |title=Cropping the skinhead image &#124; Books |date=26 April 2007 |work=The Guardian |access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref> became influenced by the [[Far-right politics|far-right]], especially [[White nationalism|white nationalists]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacists]], which led to divisions within the skinhead scene. The film's title is a direct reference to a scene where the character Combo explains his nationalist views using the phrase \"this is England\" during his speech.\n\n==Plot==\nIn July 1983, Shaun is a troubled 12-year-old boy who lives with his widowed mother and is frequently antagonised in school and around town. On the last day of the school year, Shaun gets into a fight at school with a boy named Harvey after the latter makes an offensive joke about his father, who was killed in the [[Falklands War]]. On his way home, Shaun comes across a gang of young [[skinhead]]s led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group. He introduces Shaun to Milky, the only black skinhead of the gang; Pukey, Kes, and the overweight, dim-witted Gadget. Despite some initial hostilities between Shaun and Gadget, the gang accepts Shaun as a member. Shaun bonds closely with Richard \"Woody\" Woodford, viewing him a big brother figure, and his girlfriend Lorraine \"Lol\" Jenkins, who takes a motherly role towards him. Shaun also develops a romantic relationship with Michelle, also known as Smell, an older girl who dresses in a [[New wave music|new wave]], [[new romantic]] style.\n\nDuring a party one night, the group is ambushed by a bald, tattooed, moustachioed machete-wielding man, who is then attacked by Andrew \"Combo\" Gascoigne, a first-wave skinhead. With the attack revealed to be a prank, Woody announces that Combo had just finished a three-year prison sentence, and Combo introduces the man as his associate Banjo. Combo, a charismatic but unstable man with [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] tendencies, begins to express [[English nationalism|English nationalist]] and [[Racism|racist]] views, alienating Woody, Lol, Kes, and Milky. Later on, he attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. When Combo mentions the Falklands War as part of a speech, an upset Shaun reveals to the gang that his father died in that conflict, which Combo then uses to manipulate the boy into joining his side. Consequently, the gang splits, with young Shaun, the belligerent Pukey, and Gadget, who feels bullied by Woody for his weight, choosing Combo over Woody's apolitical gang.\n\nShaun finds a hero-figure in Combo, who in turn is impressed by, and identifies with, Shaun. Combo's group attend a [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] meeting. On the drive home Pukey expresses doubt over their racist and nationalistic politics. Combo furiously stops the car and yanks Pukey out, lightly assaulting him<!-- one tap to the stomach and two light head butts, leaving no visible injuries --> in ridicule in front of the others, abandoning him in isolated countryside by the roadside.\n\nThe gang deface walls, intimidate local children and spray [[Hate crime|racist]] slogans on Asian shopkeeper Mr Sandhu's walls, whilst Shaun, previously banned from the shop, launches a bigoted verbal assault on Sandhu with demands for drink and cigarettes. Combo viciously threatens Sandhu with a [[machete]] and the gang steal goods for a birthday party under Combo's instructions.\n\nCombo becomes upset after Lol, Woody's girlfriend, rejects him when he admits that he has loved her since they had sex years before. To console himself, Combo buys [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] from Milky, and invites him to a party. While intoxicated, Combo and Milky bond, but Combo becomes increasingly bitter and envious, all wrapped up in a racist viewpoint, when Milky shares details of his many relatives, comfortable family life and happy upbringing, everything that Combo lacked.  An enraged Combo enters a frenzied state and brutally beats Milky unconscious, while Banjo holds down Shaun, and Meggy watches on in horror. An angry Combo violently throws Shaun out of his flat after Shaun verbally defends Milky, then slams the door hard. When Banjo attempts to hit Milky as well, Combo violently beats him and evicts him and Meggy from the flat. Horrified at the realisation of what he has done, a remorseful Combo weeps over Milky. Shaun and Combo later take Milky to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe film cuts forward to Shaun, who is in his bedroom looking at a picture of his late father. He is contemplating the incident and brooding about what happened, with his mother Cynthia assuring him that Milky will be all right. Shaun is then shown walking near the beach and throwing his [[Flag of England|St George's Flag]], a gift from Combo, into the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Thomas Turgoose]] as Shaun Fields\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Andrew \"Combo\" Gascoigne\n* [[Jo Hartley]] as Cynthia Fields\n* [[Joe Gilgun]] as Richard James \"Woody\" Woodford\n* [[Vicky McClure]] as Frances Lorraine \"Lol\" Jenkins\n* [[Andrew Shim]] as Michael \"Milky\"\n* [[Rosamund Hanson]] as Michelle \"Smell\"\n* Andrew Ellis as Gary \"Gadget\" Flowers\n* [[Perry Benson]] as Ronald \"Meggy\" Megford\n* George Newton as Banjo\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as \"Pukey\" Nicholls\n* Kieran Hardcastle as Kes\n* [[Chanel Cresswell]] as Kelly Jenkins\n* Danielle Watson as Trev \n* Sophie Ellerby as Pob\n* Kriss Dosanjh as Mr. Sandhu\n* [[Michael Socha]] as Harvey\n* [[Frank Harper]] as Lenny\n* Hannah Walters as Trudy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = This Is England Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 23 April 2007\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Ska]], [[reggae]], [[new wave music|new wave]]\n| length     =\n| label      = Commercial Marketing\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Shane Meadows]] film soundtracks\n| prev_title = [[Dead Man's Shoes (2004 film)#Soundtrack|Dead Man's Shoes]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Somers Town (film)#Soundtrack|Somers Town]]\n| next_year  = 2008\n}}\n\n# \"[[54-46 That's My Number|54\u201346 Was My Number]]\" \u2013 [[Toots & The Maytals]]\n# \"[[Come On Eileen]]\" \u2013 [[Dexys Midnight Runners]]\n# \"[[Tainted Love]]\" \u2013 [[Soft Cell]]\n# \"Underpass/Flares\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"Nicole (Instrumental)\" \u2013 [[Gravenhurst (band)|Gravenhurst]]\n# \"Cynth / Dad\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"Morning Sun\" \u2013 Al Barry & [[The Cimarons]]\n# \"Shoe Shop\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"[[Louie Louie]]\" \u2013 Toots & The Maytals\n# \"[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]\" \u2013 Toots & The Maytals\n# \"Hair in Cafe\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"Do the Dog\" \u2013 [[The Specials]]\n# \"Ritornare\" \u2013 [[Ludovico Einaudi]]\n# \"This Is England\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"[[Return of Django (song)|Return of Django]]\" \u2013 [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] & [[The Upsetters]]\n# \"Warhead\" \u2013 [[UK Subs]]\n# \"Fuori Dal Mondo\" \u2013 Ludovico Einaudi\n# \"[[Since Yesterday]]\" \u2013 [[Strawberry Switchblade]]\n# \"Tits\" (''Film dialogue'')\n# \"[[The Dark End of the Street]]\" \u2013 [[Percy Sledge]]\n# \"Oltremare\" \u2013 Ludovico Einaudi\n# \"[[Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want]]\" ([[The Smiths]] cover) \u2013 [[Clayhill]]\n# \"Dietro Casa\" \u2013 Ludovico Einaudi\n# \"Never Seen the Sea\" \u2013 Gavin Clark (of [[Clayhill]])\n\n;Additional music from the film includes\n# \"[[Pomp and Circumstance|Pomp and Circumstance March No 1 in D.
