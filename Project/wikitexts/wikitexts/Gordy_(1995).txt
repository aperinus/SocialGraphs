He experiences the lives of others who are part of the film's side plots, including traveling country music singers Luke McAllister and his daughter, Jinnie Sue; and lonely boy Hanky Royce whose mother, Jessica, is engaged to a sinister businessman named Gilbert Sipes. Gordy changes lives for the people he encounters due to their ability to understand him.

Current count is 675 words. -->\nA piglet named Gordy lives a happy life on Meadow Brook Farm somewhere near [[Hope, Arkansas]]. However, after the farmer goes bankrupt, he is forced to sell everything, starting with Gordy's family. Two men arrive in a truck to take Gordy's father, but Gordy is alerted of this by Richard, the rooster. He tries to stop his father from leaving by following the truck taking him, but he tells him to go home and look after his family. When he returns he finds that they were taken in another truck while he pursued his father. Determined to locate them and return to the farm, he sets out alone to find them. He eventually ends up in the care of Jinnie Sue McAllister, a young [[country singer]] who lives in a camper van with her father, Luke, and their \"manager\", Cousin Jake. She, not knowing Gordy's name, calls him Pinky.\n\nThey travel to a dinner party, where Luke performs for the governor of Arkansas. Also there is rich businessman named Henry Royce; his daughter, Jessica; her rather dull but scheming fianc\u00e9, Gilbert Sipes; and her lonely young son, Hanky. Hanky wanders off on his own and meets Gordy and Jinnie Sue. He falls into the swimming pool, but can't swim. Just as Jinnie Sue rushes off to get help, Gordy dives into the pool with an inflatable tube, and saves Hanky. Due to his bravery, he is given to Hanky as a pet, and also becomes suddenly famous.\n\nHenry and Gilbert have alternate decisions on who the new mascot of the Royce Company should be: Gordy or Jessica. In the end, Gordy wins, due to a switched camera lens used on Jessica's promotion. Gilbert is determined to remove Gordy and then take control of the company. He sends his henchmen, Dietz and Krugman, to kidnap Gordy, but he and Hanky escape by boarding a school bus, which Dietz and Krugman pursue. On the way, they are distracted briefly by a cross-dressing thief, and discover that Gordy and Hanky have escaped onto a feeding truck. They unexpectedly meet up with the McAllisters, who learn from the radio that Hanky has apparently run away. Another bulletin follows, revealing Henry has died of a heart attack. The McAllisters return Hanky and Gordy to the Royce building in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where an attorney reveals Henry has left his company to them.\n\nCousin Jake, upon learning Gordy's family is missing, organizes a giant countrywide search to locate them and also a country music concert in [[Branson, Missouri]] in Gordy's name. [[Jim Stafford]], [[Moe Bandy]], [[Boxcar Willie]], [[Cristy Lane]], [[Buck Trent]], and [[Mickey Gilley]] perform, as well as a surprise speech from President [[Bill Clinton]] (voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]), who unveils a new stamp of Gordy. Gilbert sends Dietz and Krugman to kidnap Gordy, tie him in a sack, and toss him in a river, but he is saved by Cousin Jake, who returns him to Hanky and Jinnie Sue. Everyone learns from someone who calls into the telethon that his family is going to be slaughtered at an unidentified slaughterhouse in Nebraska. Gilbert tries to hide the fact that it's owned by the Royce family. However, a battle ensues between him and Luke, with Jessica and Luke knocking him out with the suitcase of Brinks, the family attorney. Gordy, Hanky, Jinnie Sue, Jessica, Luke, Cousin Jake, and Brinks race to stop the slaughterhouse from killing Gordy's family, but a train slows them down. Hanky successfully rings the lovestruck supervisor, and the slaughterhouse is shut down just in time. To Gordy's happiness, his family has survived, and he is reunited with his father, who was also about to be killed at the slaughterhouse. The pigs are moved back to the farm, which Luke and Jessica decide to buy with most of the Royce Company profits; they marry and Hanky, Jinnie Sue, and Cousin Jake move in too. Gordy and his family are finally reunited.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Doug Stone]] as Luke McAllister: A country singer, and the father of Jinnie Sue.\n* Kristy Young as Jinnie Sue McAllister: The daughter of Luke, also a country singer.\n* [[Tom Lester]] as Cousin Jake: Luke's cousin and the manager of his group.\n* Deborah Hobart as Jessica Royce: the daughter of Henry and mother of Hanky, engaged to Gilbert.\n* Michael Roescher as Hanky Royce: The lonely but friendly son of Jessica.

I rate it at two stars, but I'd recommend it for kids.

The highlight comes when Gordy jumps into a backyard swimming pool\u2014piglets really are cutest when they put their little trotters together and dive\u2014and saves Hanky from drowning.

She later went on to say that \"It's fairly obvious that Gordy's performance was inspired by Arnold Ziffel's precedent-setting work on the old TV series ''[[Green Acres]]''. But then so was the movie, which was penned by series alumni Jay Sommers and Dick Chevillat. Their screenplay is as bland as an afternoon in ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', though the director, Australian animal-mockumentary-maker Mark Lewis, adds a touch of menace by using extreme close-ups, bizarre angles and other stylish camera work. One thing's for sure, ''Gordy'' will put little pea-pickers off their pork.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/gordygkempley_c015cc.htm|title=Gordy|work=Washington Post|date=May 12, 1995|access-date=March 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWalter V. Addiego of ''The Examiner Staff'' stated that \"The film tosses a few mild, satirical darts at [[public relations]] and [[advertising]], but otherwise it's strictly hokum from the heartland. The director, I'm sorry to say, is Mark Lewis, the Australian responsible for the strange and funny documentary ''[[Cane Toads: An Unnatural History]]'', which enlivened the S.F.

Kids will no doubt be entertained by the talking animals, cute pigs, and loads of adventure. Parents, however, should note the parent and child separation and the death of a grandparent as key concerns, as well as the scariness factor of the impending violence of the slaughterhouse, which is teased throughout the movie. If the audience is old enough to handle that potentially squeamish subject, ''Gordy'' is otherwise a passable 90 minutes of animal-talking antics.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/gordy|title=Gordy - Movie Review|author=Tracy Moore|work=Commonsensemedia.org|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> [[TV Guide]] gave the film 1\u00bd stars out of four.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/gordy/review/130779|title=Gordy: Review|publisher=Movies.tvguide.com|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Louis Black]] of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote a favorable review of the film concluding that \"A lot happens, it moves quickly, and the film is filled with minor characters who nicely round things out; my young companion watched the film from beginning to end, loving it.
