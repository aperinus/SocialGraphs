It stars a prominent [[ensemble cast]] of 11 stars \u2014 [[Vivien Leigh]] (in her final film role), [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jose Ferrer]], [[Lee Marvin]], [[Oskar Werner]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[George Segal]], [[Jose Greco]], [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]], [[Charles Korvin]] and [[Heinz Ruehmann]]. It also marked [[Christiane Schmidtmer]]'s first U.S. production.\n\n''Ship of Fools'', which was based on [[Katherine Anne Porter]]'s 1962 [[Ship of Fools (Porter novel)|novel of the same name]], was highly regarded, with reviewers praising the cast's performance but also noted the movie's overlong (for 1965) runtime. The film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] in 1966, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for [[Oskar Werner]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Simone Signoret]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]]. It won for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction, Black-and-White]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black-and-White]].\n\n==Introductory comments by Michael Dunn==\n\"My name is Carl Glocken and this... is a ship of fools. I'm a fool and you'll meet more fools as we go along... this tub is packed with them. Emancipated ladies... ball players... lovers... dog lovers... ladies of joy... tolerant Jews... dwarfs... all kinds... and who knows... if you look closely enough, you may even find yourself on board.\"\n\n==Plot==\nThe action of the film takes place almost entirely on board a passenger ship in 1933, between [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] Mexico and [[Bremerhaven]], Germany. Most of the scenes unfold on the First Class deck or among the upper middle-class passengers, but the ship is carrying 600 displaced workers, far more than the ship is certified to carry and they're assigned to squalid conditions in [[steerage]]. They are all being deported [[Spanish immigration to Cuba|back to Spain]] by the order of the Cuban dictator, [[Gerardo Machado]]. Many passengers bound for [[Nazi Germany]] are happy, some are apprehensive, while others downplay the significance of fascist politics.\n\nThe ship's medical officer, Dr. Schumann, takes a special interest in {{lang|es|La Condesa}}, a countess from Cuba who has an opiate addiction which he reluctantly accommodates with prescriptions. She is being transported to a Spanish prison on the Canary Island of [[Tenerife]]. Her sense of doom is contrasted with the doctor's initial determination to fight the forces of oppression, embodied by his insistence that the people in steerage be treated like human beings rather than cargo. The doctor conceals having a heart condition. His sympathy for the countess soon evolves into love, though both realize it is a hopeless passion.\n\nSelected passengers are invited to dine each night at the captain's table. Some are amused and others offended by the anti-Semitic rants of a German businessman named Rieber who \u2013 though married \u2013 begins an affair with Lizzi. The Jewish Lowenthal is not invited and is seated at a side table with a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] named Glocken and the two bond over their sense of social exclusion. Later a passenger named Freytag is shocked to find himself blackballed from the Captain's Table when Rieber learns Freytag's wife is Jewish and after an angry public outburst, he too is re-seated at the side table. Here Lowenthal counsels Glocken regarding tactical accommodation to the Nazis from people like Rieber, stating that [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany has been good for the Jews and the Jews have been good for Germany]], \"We are Germans first and Jews second...There are nearly a million Jews in Germany. What are they going to do, [[Shoah|kill all of us]]?\"\n\nOthers aboard include an American couple, David and Jenny. Jenny is infatuated with David, who is disconsolate at his lack of success as a socially committed artist and feels stifled by Jenny's needy dependence. Mary Treadwall, a divorc\u00e9e, drinks and flirts. She is on a quest to recapture her lost youth while in Paris, but the men who take an interest in her she rejects as unworthy. Bill Tenny is a former baseball player with a drinking problem, angry the way his career never took off. Passengers are entertained nightly by a troupe of [[flamenco]] musicians and dancers, whose leader pimps the women in the troupe, while other passengers regularly drink themselves to oblivion. One young heir to a fortune loses his virginity to one of the flamenco dancers, who treats him with gentleness.\n\nThe ship arrives in Spain where the displaced workers from steerage disembark.  Here, after an emotionally painful farewell with the doctor, {{lang|es|La Condesa}} is forced to exit the ship under [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] escort. Upon arrival in Germany, the remaining passengers depart the ship. The doctor dies before the ship reaches [[Bremerhaven]] and his body is unloaded in a coffin. At the disembarkation, which seems like a parade, most characters show they will behave as though it is 'business as usual.'\n\nThe last passenger to leave the 'Ship of Fools' is Glocken, who [[speaks directly to camera]], as he did in the opening minutes of the film. Glocken asks the film's audience if they are thinking \"What has all this to do with us?\" (meaning the passengers). \"Nothing\" he adds and exits into the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Vivien Leigh]] as Mary Treadwell     \n* [[Simone Signoret]] as La Condesa\n* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Rieber \n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Tenny\n* [[Oskar Werner]] as Dr. Schumann \n* [[Elizabeth Ashley]] as Jenny \n* [[George Segal]] as David\n* [[Jose Greco]] as Pepe \n* [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]] as Glocken \n* [[Charles Korvin]] as Capt.
