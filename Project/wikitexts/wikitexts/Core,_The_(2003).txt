J. Qualls]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo|Tcheky Karyo]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], and [[Alfre Woodard]]. The film focuses on a team whose mission is to drill to the center of the Earth and set off a series of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear explosions]] in order to restart the rotation of the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's core]]. The film was released on March 28, 2003, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $74 million worldwide with a production budget of $85 million.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral small, disparate incidents involving the [[Earth's magnetic field]] cause scientists led by [[Geophysics|geophysicist]] Dr. Josh Keyes and scientists Dr. Serge Leveque and Dr. Conrad Zimsky to conclude that the Earth's molten core has stopped rotating. Unless it can be restarted, the field will collapse within months, exposing the surface to devastating [[solar radiation]]. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] back a secret project to build a vessel that can drill to the core and release [[nuclear weapon]]s to restart the rotation. They utilize the work of Dr. Ed \"Braz\" Brazzelton who has developed a material \"[[Unobtainium]]\" that can withstand and convert extreme heat into electricity, as well as a laser-based high-speed drilling array. [[NASA]] pilots [[Commander]] Robert Iverson and [[Major]] Rebecca \"Beck\" Childs are enlisted to pilot the multi-compartment vessel ''USS Virgil'', while computer [[hacker]] Theodore Donald \"Rat\" Finch is brought on to keep news of the pending disaster or the attempt to restart the core from the Internet.\n\n''Virgil'' is launched through the [[Marianas Trench]] and successfully makes its way through the crust. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty [[geode]] structure, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base. As they traverse outside the ship to free the vessel from the crystalline structures, the geode starts to flood with magma, and Iverson is impaled by a falling shard and falls into the magma. The rest manage to return in time as ''Virgil'' continues its descent. Further down, they pass through a field of gigantic [[diamond]] formations, one of which breaches the last compartment housing the detonation timers for the [[Nuclear bombs|nuclear charges]]. Leveque sacrifices himself to make sure that the others have the charges and launch codes before the compartment is crushed by the extreme pressure.\n\nThe team reaches the molten core and realizes it is much less dense than previously thought, throwing off their calculations on restarting its motions. They communicate with the surface, where Lieutenant General Thomas Purcell, overseeing the operation, orders them to abandon the effort and return immediately as they plan to use a secondary protocol to restart the core. Finch is secretly communicating with the ''Virgil'' team and learns that this secondary protocol is the top-secret project \"DESTINI\" ('''D'''eep '''E'''arth '''S'''eismic '''T'''rigger '''INI'''tiative). Keyes finds that Zimsky was a lead scientist on \"DESTINI,\" a [[tectonic weapon]] intended to be used by the U.S. but, when first tested, had caused the core's rotation to stop. Finch redirects power from DESTINI to prevent Purcell from activating it again, as Keyes fears that it could destroy the Earth instead of restarting the core. Meanwhile, destructive events, including a [[thunderstorm|lightning storm]] in [[Rome]] and a burst of [[ultraviolet]] rays that destroys the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], alert the world to the situation.\n\nOn ''Virgil'', the remaining team comes up with a plan to place an explosive in each of the remaining compartments, release them, and time their detonations in an exact sequence to trigger the core's rotation through constructive [[wave interference]]. Due to the faulty design of ''Virgil'' because of time constraints, Brazzelton has to sacrifice himself to engage the compartment detachment mechanism in the vessel's underbelly. As they set the charges, Keyes and Zimsky realize that they need more explosive power than previously thought and in their race to adjust timings, Zimsky becomes trapped in a detached compartment. Keyes uses ''Virgil''{{'}}s nuclear power source to provide the additional energy for the final detonation. While it leaves the main compartment powerless and Keyes and Childs trapped, the other explosions successfully restart the core's rotation. Keyes recalls that the unobtainium shell can convert the heat and pressure to energy, and the two of them wire the shell directly to their systems in time to power the craft and ride the pressure wave out of the core and up towards the surface through [[tectonic plates]], eventually breaching into the floor of the ocean near [[Hawaii]]. Due to the much lower heat and pressure in this environment, ''Virgil'' no longer has sufficient power to establish communications. The government searches for them, and Finch, tracking nearby [[whale sound]], realizes that the ''Virgil'' crew are using low-power [[ultrasound]] to draw whales nearby. Keyes and Childs are soon rescued.\n\nIn the aftermath, Finch uploads information about ''Virgil'' and its team and the classified information about \"DESTINI\" across the Internet, causing the world to revere the crew as heroes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Dr. Joshua \"Josh\" Keyes, a scientist and professor at the [[University of Chicago]] who designs the navigation system for ''Virgil'' and is assigned as head of the project.\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Major (United States)|Major]] Rebecca \"Beck\" Childs, [[United States Air Force|USAF]], an astronaut who distinguished herself during an emergency crash landing of the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] in Los Angeles, California, a result of the magnetic instability.\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Dr. Edward \"Braz\" Brazzelton, the designer of ''Virgil'' and the ultrasonic lasers. \n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dr. Conrad Zimsky, Earth specialist and designer of Project D.E.S.T.INI., based in Alaska. He went on high alert after the magnetic instability caused an attack in Trafalgar Square by an enormous flock of pigeons.\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo|Tcheky Karyo]] as Dr. Serge Leveque, nuclear weapons specialist.\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Robert \"Bob\" Iverson, [[United States Navy|USN]], Major Childs' commander and mentor.\n* [[DJ Qualls|D. J. Qualls]] as Theodore Donald \"Rat\" Finch, a computer hacker who is widely regarded as the best in the world, crippled the FBI's database, recruited to control the flow of information on the Internet to prevent public panic.\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Dr. Talma \"Stick\" Stickley, the mission controller for [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] and ''Virgil''.\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Thomas Purcell, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], leader of the operation.\n* [[Fred Ewanuick|Fred Ewanvick]] as ''Endeavor'' Flight Engineer Jenkins\n\n==Production==\n''The Core'' had out-to-sea scenes, starring {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}}, with full support of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]].\n\nThe original plan for the shuttle landing scene had been for ''Endeavour'' to attempt a landing at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] with the shuttle coming to a halt on the nearby beaches. However, due to the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the crew was not allowed to film at LAX. The scene was therefore rewritten with ''Endeavour'' landing in the LA river.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Core'' garnered mixed reviews from critics. It has a 40% approval rating based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10, on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the site's consensus states, \"A B-movie with its tongue planted firmly in cheek, ''The Core'' is so unintentionally (intentionally?) bad that it's a hoot.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Core (2003)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/core|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506231318/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/core|archive-date=May 6, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], another aggregation website, the film has a [[weighted average]] score of 48 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Core (2003)|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-core|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=May 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220504044258/https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-core|archive-date=May 4, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> In his review, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said \"I have such an unreasonable affection for this movie, indeed, that it is only by slapping myself alongside the head and drinking black coffee that I can restrain myself from recommending it.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-core-2003|title=The Core movie review & film summary (2003)|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=March 28, 2003|access-date=October 16, 2020|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220309053631/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-core-2003|archive-date=March 9, 2022|url-status=live|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $31.1 million in United States theaters, and another $43.0 million overseas for a total worldwide gross of $74.1 million<ref name=\"Numbers\"/> against a production budget of $85 million.<ref name=\"Numbers\">[http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Core-The#tab=summary The Numbers.com]</ref>\n\nSeveral reviews cited the numerous scientific inaccuracies in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/4722-physicist-explains-the-non-science-of-the-core|title=When Sci-Fi Goes Wrong: Physicist Explains the Non-Science of The Core|last=Tracey|first=Janey|website=www.outerplaces.com|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciencefiction.com/2012/02/13/did-the-movie-the-core-get-anything-right/|title=Did The Movie 'The Core' Get Anything Right?|date=February 13, 2012|website=ScienceFiction.com|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.headstuff.org/entertainment/film/the-core-at-15/|title=Bad Science {{!}} The Core at 15|date=March 28, 2018|website=HeadStuff|language=en-GB|access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref> [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"The brazen silliness of ''The Core'' is becalming and inauthentic, like taking a bath in nondairy coffee creamer.
