It is the sequel to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014), and the second and final installment in the reboot series. Directed by [[Dave Green (director)|Dave Green]] and written by [[Josh Appelbaum]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Nemec]], the film stars [[Megan Fox]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Laura Linney]], [[Stephen Amell]], [[Noel Fisher]], [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]], [[Pete Ploszek]], [[Alan Ritchson]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Gary Anthony Williams]], [[Brian Tee]], and [[Sheamus]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on April 27, 2015, in [[New York City]]. It was released on June 3, 2016, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, with some deeming it a slight improvement over its predecessor. However, it was [[box-office bomb|not financially successful]] and grossed only $245 million against a $135 million budget,<ref name=BOM/><ref name=\"blockbustersbomb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/07/08/box-office-as-blockbusters-bomb-tentpoles-arrive-with-dread/ |title=Box Office: As Blockbusters Bomb, Tentpoles Arrive Not With Excitement But With Dread |first=Scott |last=Mendelson |author-link=Scott Mendelson |work=[[Forbes]] |date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=July 9, 2016 }}</ref> resulting in a planned third film being scrapped. A [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] is being planned.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after stopping [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], <!--A news report stated that only one year had passed since the events of the previous film.--> the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] are informed by [[April O'Neil]] that scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] is working for Shredder and plans to bust him out of prison. As the Shredder is transferred between prisons alongside [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] by [[corrections officer]] [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], the [[Foot Clan]] attack their convoy. Despite the turtles' interference, Shredder escapes when Stockman uses a [[teleportation]] device. Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport, winds up in [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|another dimension]], and meets the alien warlord [[Krang]], who reveals his plans to invade Earth. He gives Shredder a mutagenic compound in exchange for finding three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago which will open a portal to his dimension when united, as Shredder and Stockman have the first piece. Casey tells [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[Chief of police|chief]] Rebecca Vincent what happened to Shredder, but is met with disbelief, and decides to go on his own.\n\nShredder recruits Bebop and Rocksteady, and Stockman uses Krang's mutagen to transform them into a humanoid warthog and rhinoceros, respectively. April witnesses their transformation and steals the remaining mutagen vial from the TCRI lab. Pursued by the Foot, she is rescued by Casey, who later meets the turtles, but the vial is taken into police custody. In the lair, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the turtles into humans, but [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] refuses and orders Donatello to keep it a secret from the others. However, [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] overhears and tells [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], which enrages Raphael and leads to a fierce argument between him and Leo. Raphael then recruits Mikey, April, Casey, and Vern Fenwick to break into the NYPD headquarters and retrieve the mutagen, but the Foot arrive ahead of them. In the ensuing battle, the turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who start a manhunt for them, and April and Casey are arrested while helping the brothers escape with the mutagen.\n\nAfter recovering the second component of the machine, Bebop and Rocksteady go to the rainforests of [[Manaus, Brazil]], for the final component. The turtles follow them and board Bebop and Rocksteady's jet in midair. In the resulting battle, the jet is critically damaged after Rocksteady fires a [[M1 Abrams|tank]]-mounted [[Mark 19 grenade launcher]], and crashes into a river, though Bebop and Rocksteady are ultimately able to escape with the component. Shredder and Stockman complete the device and open a portal to Krang's dimension through which his war machine, the [[Technodrome]], begins to emerge. Shredder betrays Stockman and his men take him to their headquarters in Tokyo. When entering the Technodrome, Krang likewise betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him with his collection of other defeated foes.\n\nUnable to reach the Technodrome as the police pursue them, the turtles debate over taking the mutagen to become human and fight openly. While Leonardo agrees, Raph shatters the vial. Upon April's request, Vern recovers the security footage from a hidden TCRI camera that proves Stockman and the Shredder's collaboration and secures April and Casey's release. April arranges a meeting between the turtles and Vincent, and convinces her that they are not enemies. With the help of the police, the turtles are able to jump from the [[Chrysler Building]] and confront Krang aboard the still-assembling Technodrome. Krang is defeated when Donatello short circuits his robotic body. April, Casey and Vern raid the Foot Clan facility, defeat Bebop, Rocksteady and the Shredder's lieutenant [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] and take control of the device. The turtles are able to hurl the ship's beacon back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it, as April, Casey, and Vern shut the portal down.\n\nBebop and Rocksteady are back in custody, while Stockman remains at large. The turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD along with April, Casey, and Vern. Vincent offers to introduce the turtles to the public, but the turtles opt to keep their existence a secret while still helping as they always have. On top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], the turtles celebrate their victory over the vanquished Krang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Voice actors and motion-capture===\n* [[Pete Ploszek]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: The leader of the turtles who wields a pair of [[katana]] in battle.
