Helping to protect [[sharks]], changing government policy, and inspiring the creation of shark conservation groups, ''Sharkwater'' is considered one of conservation's success stories, resulting in [[shark finning]] being banned in over 90 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sharkwater.com/sharkwater-extinction/sharkwater-extinction-synopsis/|title=Sharkwater Extinction Synopsis &#124; Sharkwater Extinction|date=April 26, 2018|website=Sharkwater: Extinction}}</ref> In the film, Stewart documents current attitudes about [[shark]]s, and how shark-hunting industries are driving them to [[extinction]].\n\n''Sharkwater'' explores the densest shark hunting populations in the world, [[Shark fin trading in Costa Rica|exposing the exploitation and corruption of the shark-hunting industry]] in the marine reserves of [[Cocos Island]], [[Costa Rica]] and the [[Galapagos Islands]], [[Ecuador]].\n\nStewart travels with [[Paul Watson]] and his [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] ship as they confront shark poachers in [[Guatemala]] and Costa Rica. Among the group's experiences are boat confrontations, poachers, police, corrupt court systems, and eventually murder charges. Also, Stewart states how the increasing demand for [[shark-fin soup]] in Asia is fuelling an illegal trade in sharks. His expedition is cut short, however, when he is diagnosed with [[necrotizing fasciitis]], from which he recovers.\n\nStewart discovers that sharks prevent the overconsumption of [[plankton]] by other fish, which moderates [[climate change]]. Yet sharks have gone from predator to prey, and while they have survived Earth's [[mass extinctions]], they could be extinct within a few years.\n\nThe film has received 31 international awards.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0856008|title=Sharkwater}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nStewart was working on a sequel film, ''[[Sharkwater Extinction]]'', at the time of his death in January 2017.<ref>[https://etcanada.com/news/326890/teaser-from-the-late-rob-stewarts-third-film-sharkwater-extinction-released/ \"Teaser From The Late Rob Stewart\u2019s Third Film \u2018Sharkwater: Extinction\u2019 Released\"].
