McKittrick wrote the screenplay while working as a [[waiting staff|waiter]].\n\nThe script was initially sold in a film deal to [[Artisan Entertainment]], but was released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] (which purchased Artisan in 2003). Producers [[Chris Moore (film producer)|Chris Moore]] and Jeff Balis of Live Planet's ''[[Project Greenlight]]'' fame also took notice of the project and assisted. The film made over US$6 million, more than twice the budget of the film, in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"Box Office\">{{cite news | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=waiting.htm | title=Waiting... | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=2007-10-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a single day at \"Shenaniganz\", a franchise restaurant. Dean, who has been working there for four years, learns from his mother that a schoolmate recently graduated from college and has secured a high paying job in [[electrical engineering]]. \n\nDean's co-worker Monty takes new employee Mitch through his training, introducing him to the staff both in the restaurant and kitchen. Monty also shows Mitch the \"Penis Game\", where the male staff deliberately expose their genitalia to their unsuspecting coworkers, as well as the ways the staff deal with rude and entitled customers. In one scene food is sent back which the kitchen staff then gladly contaminate with spit, [[dandruff]] and other unsavory bits.\n\nThe remaining waitstaff comprise of Serena, Monty's ex-girlfriend; Natasha, the underage hostess who shares a [[ephebophilia|mutual attraction]] with Monty; Amy, who is Dean's girlfriend; Calvin, a hopeless romantic who [[Paruresis|cannot urinate in public]], and Naomi, a constantly angry waitress. Managing them is Dan, who offers Dean the Assistant Manager position in competition to Calvin. However, an altercation with a customer who left a pitiful tip to Dean results in Dan demanding an answer from him by the end of the day.\n\nAs the day winds down, Dean is left on his own during the final hour of business. In the last few minutes of opening time two new guests arrive, one of which Dean quickly realizes is Chet, his successful schoolmate. Initially annoyed, Dean is humbled by Chet when he leaves Dean $100 for his $30 meal, leaving Dean with $70 in tips. Ironically, Chet reiterates 'You look like you need it more than me', which Dean had retorted to the earlier customer. When Dean is called to Dan's office to give his decision in regards to the promotion, Dean ultimately turns it down and quits instead to return to college for a more promising future.\n\nWhen the shift ends, the staff all head to a party at Monty and Dean's house, where Monty refrains from having sex with the underage Natasha as she is not of legal age yet, but promises they will when she does the following week. Mitch, who had been unable to speak all day largely due to Monty's interruptions, finally rants in regards to the entire staff and quits. Prior to leaving, Mitch exposes his genitals in the form of \"The Goat\", which head chef Raddimus had said earlier would grant him instant god-status. Monty declares his allegiance to Mitch, having now replaced Dean in his absence.\n\nIn a post credits scene, Dan is shown arriving at the customers house who Dean had insulted earlier, incorrectly believing it was the location of the party. The customer angrily demands from Dan the milkshake he was earlier promised.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Monty Cook\n* [[Justin Long]] as Dean Saunders\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Serena Vowles\n* [[David Koechner]] as Daniel Christopher Pratt\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Raddimus Lopez\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Bishop Coleman\n* [[John Francis Daley]] as Mitch Haim\n* [[Kaitlin Doubleday]] as Amy Presley\n* [[Rob Benedict|Robert Patrick Benedict]] as Calvin Costanza\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Naomi\n* [[Vanessa Lengies]] as Natasha Willett\n* [[Max Kasch]] as Theodore \"T-Dog\"\n* [[Andy Milonakis]] as Nick\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Floyd Biggs\n* [[Jordan Ladd]] as Danielle\n* [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Tyla, The Bartender\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Monty's Mom\n* [[Skyler Stone]] as Cook #1\n* [[JD Evermore]] as Redneck\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Waiting...'' was filmed in [[New Orleans]]; [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana]]; and [[Kenner, Louisiana]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Waiting...
