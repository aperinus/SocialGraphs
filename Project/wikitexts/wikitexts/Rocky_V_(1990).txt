Avildsen]] (the first time since the [[Rocky (film)|first film]] of the franchise), written by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=\"Rocky V\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/21906/Rocky-V/|title=Rocky V|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=February 28, 2016}}</ref> It is the sequel to ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985) and is the fifth installment in the [[Rocky franchise|''Rocky'' franchise]]. It also stars [[Talia Shire]], [[Burt Young]], [[Sage Stallone]], [[Tommy Morrison]] and [[Burgess Meredith]]. In the film, a financially struggling [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone) agrees to train prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Tommy Gunn (Morrison) at the gym once owned by Balboa's trainer, [[Mickey Goldmill]] (Meredith).<ref>{{cite news|title= Film Flam for 'Rocky' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 15, 1989|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/sports/film-flam-for-rocky.html |access-date=August 12, 2010 | first=Phil | last=Berger}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment for the film began in 1989, after Stallone completed the screenplay. Avildsen, who directed the first installment, was soon confirmed to return and [[principal photography]] began in January 1990, being largely filmed on location around [[Philadelphia]]. The filmmakers encountered creative differences with [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.|MGM/UA]] and were disallowed to include darker elements of Stallone's original screenplay, who had envisioned ''Rocky V'' as the final film in the franchise. The film also marks the final appearances of Shire and Meredith in the franchise.\n\n''Rocky V'' was theatrically released in the United States by MGM/UA on November 16, 1990. The film received negative reviews, with criticism for its screenplay, characterization, continuity errors and medical inaccuracies; Stallone later expressed regret over the outcome of the film. It is usually considered the worst movie of the [[Rocky franchise|''Rocky'' franchise]]. ''Rocky V'' also underperformed expectations at the box office, grossing $120 million worldwide, making it the lowest grossing film in the franchise. A sequel, ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn the aftermath of his victory over [[Ivan Drago]] in Moscow, [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] finds himself experiencing physical complications from the fight. Rocky, his wife [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian]], his brother-in-law Paulie, and his trainer Tony \"Duke\" Evers return to the United States where they are greeted by Rocky's son, Robert Jr. At a press conference, boxing promoter George Washington Duke attempts to goad Rocky into fighting his boxer, Union Cane, who is the top-rated challenger, but Rocky declines.\n\nAfter returning home, Rocky and Adrian discover they are bankrupt after Paulie was fooled into signing a \"[[power of attorney]]\" over to Rocky's accountant, who squandered all of his money on [[real estate]] deals gone sour and failed to pay Rocky's [[Income tax|taxes]] over the previous six years. His mansion has been mortgaged by $400,000, but his attorney tells Rocky that it is fixable with a few more fights. Rocky initially accepts the fight with Cane, but Adrian urges him to see a doctor, and he is diagnosed with [[cavum septum pellucidum]].\n\nReluctantly, Rocky retires from boxing. His home and belongings are sold to pay the debt and the Balboas move back to their old working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia. Rocky visits Mighty Mick's Gym (willed to his son by his old trainer Mickey Goldmill), which has fallen into disrepair. Seeing a vision of himself and Mickey from years past, Rocky draws inspiration to become a trainer himself and reopens the gym.\n\nRocky and Paulie meet a young fighter from Oklahoma named Tommy Gunn. Rocky agrees to become his manager. Training him gives Rocky a sense of purpose, and Tommy rises to become a top contender. Distracted with Tommy's training, Rocky neglects Robert, who is being [[bullied]] at school. After learning to defend himself, Robert falls in with the wrong crowd and becomes withdrawn from his family.\n\nUnion Cane wins the vacant world heavyweight title. Still wanting to do business with Rocky, Washington showers Tommy with luxuries and promises him that he is the only path to a shot at the title. Rocky insists dealing with Washington will end badly, causing Tommy to desert him. Adrian attempts to comfort Rocky but Rocky vents his frustrations by telling her his life had a new meaning by training Tommy. Adrian tells Rocky that Tommy never had his heart and that was something he could never learn. Realizing that his family is his top priority, Rocky apologizes to Adrian and the two embrace. Rocky then apologizes to Robert and they mend their relationship.\n\nTommy defeats Cane for the heavyweight title with a first-round knockout, but is jeered by spectators for leaving Rocky and hounded by reporters after the fight. Tommy gives all the credit for his success to George Washington Duke, which only fans the flames of contempt for Tommy by the fans and media. They insist that Cane was nothing but a \"paper champion\", because Cane did not [[Lineal championship|win the title from Balboa]].\n\nWashington convinces Tommy that he needs to secure a fight with Rocky to refute the notion that he is not the real champion. Washington and Tommy show up at the local bar with a live television crew to goad Rocky into accepting a title fight. Rocky declines and tries to reason with him, but Tommy calls him weak, prompting Paulie to stand up for Rocky. When Tommy punches Paulie, Rocky challenges Tommy to a street fight on the spot; despite Duke's objections, Tommy accepts.\n\nRocky initially knocks Tommy to the ground with a flurry of punches, but Tommy gets up and attacks Rocky from behind. Rocky is beaten down by Tommy, seeing nightmarish visions of Drago, before a vision of Mickey urges him to get up and continue the fight. When Robert and Adrian see the brawl being televised, they rush to the back alley to cheer for Rocky. With Robert, Paulie, Adrian and the neighborhood crowd cheering him on, Rocky makes use of his street-fighting skills and defeats Tommy.\n\nWhile Tommy is escorted away by the police, Washington threatens to sue Rocky if he touches him. After a brief hesitation, Rocky knocks him onto the hood of a car, defiantly replying \"Sue me for what?\"\n\nMonths later, Rocky and Robert climb up the [[Rocky Steps]], see his statue, and are about to go inside and explore the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] when Rocky gives his son [[Rocky Marciano]]'s cufflink, given to him years earlier as a gift from Mickey.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{see also|List of Rocky characters}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": Heavyweight Champion of the World, who suffers from brain damage caused by the head-trauma he received at the hands of [[Ivan Drago]] in the previous film. Because of his injuries, Rocky is forced to officially retire from boxing.

Throughout his career he is called Rocky's \"shadow\", and angrily seeks out another manager.

Burgess appears in new footage, filmed as a flashback to before Rocky's second fight with [[Apollo Creed|Apollo]].\n* [[Richard Gant]] as [[George Washington Duke (fictional character)|George Washington Duke]]: Loud and obnoxious boxing promoter, who repeatedly tries to convince Rocky to re-enter the ring.

Micale as Father Carmine (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Williams (boxer)|Michael Williams]] as [[Union Cane]]: Reigning Heavyweight Champion of the World who wants to fight legendary Rocky, and eventually fights Tommy Gunn. Williams was also a real-life boxer. He and Morrison were to have an actual match about a month after ''Rocky V'' was released, but it was canceled when Williams was hurt. The match was being hyped as \"The Real Cane vs. Gunn Match.\"\n\nThe film has cameos by sportswriters and boxing analysts, including [[Al Bernstein]], Stan Hochman and Al Meltzer, and sportscaster [[Stu Nahan]], who was the ringside announcer in every ''Rocky'' movie, save the sixth and seventh. [[Dolph Lundgren]] and [[Carl Weathers]] appear as [[Ivan Drago]] and [[Apollo Creed]] in archival footage, uncredited. [[Mr. T]] appears as his ''[[Rocky III]]'' character [[Clubber Lang]] in archival footage, uncredited. [[Hulk Hogan]], from his ''Rocky III'' role as [[Thunderlips]], appears in a still shot during the film's end credits sequence taken from the staredown the two engaged in during said film, also uncredited.\n\nJodi Letizia, who played street kid Marie in the original ''Rocky'' (1976), was supposed to reprise her role. Her character was shown to have ended up as Rocky predicted she would: a prostitute, but the scene ended up on the cutting room floor. She can briefly be seen during the street fight at the end. The character reappears in ''Rocky Balboa'' (2006) as a bartender and confidante to the aging Rocky. Actress [[Geraldine Hughes]] took over the role.\n\n[[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], who gained success as [[Eric Murphy]] on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', was in his first acting role as neighborhood bully Chickie.\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nFilming began in mid-January 1990.<ref name=loveinway>{{cite news |last=Hinds |first=Michael Decourcy |title=Love Gets in the Way as Rocky V Starts Filming |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/movies/love-gets-in-the-way-as-rocky-v-starts-filming.html |access-date=21 September 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 23, 1990}}</ref> Some of the fight sequences were filmed at [[The Blue Horizon]] in Philadelphia, a venue which was a mecca for boxing in the city during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Philly\u2019s Rocky V Boxing Venue Abandoned and Demolished |url=https://totalrocky.com/articles/philadelphia-rocky-v-boxing-venue-demolished/ |website=totalrocky.com |publisher=TotalRocky.com |access-date=3 July 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe Rocky statue, which was commissioned for ''[[Rocky III]]'', had since been gifted to the city of Philadelphia and moved to the entrance of the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]], and so had to be moved back to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] for the filming.<ref name=loveinway/>\n\nScenes with Mickey, played by [[Burgess Meredith]], were trimmed in the final film when Rocky fights Tommy. Mickey appeared in ghost form on top of the railway bridge, giving words of encouragement. In the final film, this was made into flashbacks. The speech Mickey gives to Rocky in the flashback sequence is based on an interview with [[Cus D'Amato]] given in 1985, shortly after [[Mike Tyson]]'s first professional bout.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mickeys Inspiration was Cus D'Amato ROCKY V SPEECH|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFWwGfqtl4g}}</ref>\n\nAs a promotional gimmick, replicas of the golden glove necklace featured so prominently in the film were distributed to moviegoers at the Hollywood premiere of ''Rocky V'' at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\nProfessional wrestling veteran [[Terry Funk]] helped choreograph much of the street fight between Rocky and Tommy Gunn.\n\nIn the original script, Rocky is killed during the final fight with Tommy, dying in Adrian's arms in the street.<ref>{{cite news|title= He could have been a contender |date=December 5, 1997|newspaper= Independent|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/he-could-have-been-a-contender-1286809.html|access-date=October 29, 2010|location=London|first=Nick|last=Hasted}}</ref> According to Stallone, the director and the studio had second thoughts. Eventually, Stallone rewrote the ending, saying that he decided to change it because Rocky was supposed to be about perseverance and redemption, and having him die in a street brawl would be against the roots of the series.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\n===Continuity===\nIn the years following the film's release, Stallone acknowledged that the injury which forces Rocky to retire, referenced in the film as a potentially lethal form of '[[brain damage]]', was inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861 |title=Round One With Sylvester Stallone Q&A!! |website=Aintitcool.com |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> Stallone stated that having discussed the story with many boxing medical professionals, the injury Rocky suffered was a milder form of brain damage, similar to that of a long term concussion that many boxers suffer from and by modern-day standards are still able to gain licenses to box. It would not have prevented Rocky from gaining a license to box nor killed him.<ref name=AICNQA>{{cite web|author=Moriaty|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30861|title=Round One With Sylvester Stallone Q&A!!|website=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=December 1, 2006|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Tony Burton]] briefly reprises his role as Duke at the beginning of the film. However, during his scenes, Rocky refers to him as \"Tony\". In the credits, Burton is credited as playing \"Tony\", as opposed to \"Duke\" (possibly to avoid confusion with the George Washington Duke character). ''Rocky V'' is the third time in the series to do so, with the first being ''Rocky II'' as Apollo asked \"What are you afraid of, Tony?\", and the second time during ''Rocky IV'' after receiving a pep talk in the former Soviet Union, \"Thanks, Tony.\" ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' names Burton's character \"Duke Evers\".\n\n[[Sage Stallone]], Sylvester's real-life son, portrays his character's son in the film. In ''Rocky IV'', he was portrayed as a nine-year-old child whereas Sage was 14 at the time of filming, making him a teenager in ''Rocky V'', despite it taking place just days after the events of ''Rocky IV''.\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{main|Rocky V: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture}}\nThe soundtrack album is not the original motion picture score, but rather has music from and inspired by the film. This soundtrack features [[Joey B. Ellis]], [[MC Hammer]], [[7A3]], MC Tab, [[Rob Base]], and [[Bill Conti]]. Most of the soundtrack album contains rap music, rather than the Bill Conti score. Also, two of the scores from ''Rocky IV'' were featured in this film's trailer, but were not present in the actual film or soundtrack. \"The Measure of a Man\" was written by [[Alan Menken]], [[Elton John]], [[Tim Rice]] and performed by John.\n\nLike ''Rocky IV'', a full version of \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\" with lyrics is not heard in the film. However an instrumental horn version is played during the early scene where Rocky gets off the airplane, and at the end of the movie after Rocky defeats Tommy, another instrumental version is heard.  In addition, a solo piano version is heard during several scenes including where Balboa speaks with his son upon his return from Russia, and during the scenes where his property is being auctioned.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nAnticipated to be one of the big hits of the 1990 holiday season, ''Rocky V'' finished third in its opening weekend, trailing ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' and ''[[Home Alone]]'', and never recovered. The film earned US$14 million on its opening weekend and $41 million in total in the US and Canada, about one-third of its predecessor's take.
