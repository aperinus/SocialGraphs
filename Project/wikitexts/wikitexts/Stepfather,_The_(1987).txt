O'Quinn stars as an identity-assuming serial killer who marries a widow with a teenage daughter. Having killed his previous family and changed his identity, his murderous tendencies continue after his stepdaughter becomes suspicious of him. The film is loosely based on the life of mass murderer [[John List (murderer)|John List]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Desmond|title=How Profitable Sequels Succeed: They Just Bring 'em Back Alive|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-12-03/entertainment/26158069_1_stepfather-mortal-coil-predator-ii|access-date=19 April 2013|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=December 3, 1989}}</ref> although the plot is more commonly associated with [[slasher film]]s of the era. The film was written by [[Donald E. Westlake]], from a story by Westlake, Carolyn Lefcourt, and [[Brian Garfield]] with an uncredited rewrite by [[David Loughery]].\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on January 23, 1987. It grossed $2.5 million at the box office and was well-received by critics. It has since gained a [[cult following]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Stepfather II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Stepfather III]]'' (1992), and a remake, also called ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'', released in 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nHenry Morrison assumes a different identity in the attempt to find the perfect family. In the beginning of the movie, he washes off blood in a bathroom after murdering the family he had been living with. He then changes his appearance and puts his belongings into a suitcase. Henry leaves through the front door of his house, nonchalantly passing the butchered remains of his family. Boarding a [[ferry]], Henry throws the suitcase containing the objects from his former life into the ocean. One year later, Henry\u2014now operating as a real estate agent named Jerry Blake in the [[suburb]]s of [[Seattle]]\u2014has married the widow Susan Maine. Jerry's relationship with Susan's 16-year-old daughter, Stephanie, is strained. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Bondurant, advises her to give Jerry a chance. Stephanie, meanwhile, has a lot of behavioral issues at school and is skeptical of Jerry and his intentions.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Ogilvie, the brother of Jerry's murdered previous wife, runs an article about his sister's murder in the newspaper and attempts to find the man that killed his sister. While hosting a neighborhood barbecue, Jerry discovers the article and is disturbed by it. Jerry goes into the basement of the house and begins maniacally rambling to himself, unaware that Stephanie has also entered the basement. Discovering his stepdaughter, Jerry brushes off his outbursts by saying that he was simply letting off steam. He tells her not to worry. Stephanie finds the newspaper mentioning Jerry's earlier killings and comes to believe her stepfather is the murderer mentioned in the article. She writes a letter to the newspaper requesting a photo of Henry Morrison, but Jerry finds the photo in the mail and replaces it with a stranger's photo, allaying her suspicions.\n\nCurious about Stephanie's stepfather, who has repeatedly refused to meet him, Dr. Bondurant makes an appointment with Jerry under an assumed name, saying he wants to buy a house. During their meeting, Bondurant asks too many personal questions and Jerry realizes that Bondurant is not who he says he is, and, mistakenly believing he is an undercover cop, beats him to death and puts him in Bondurant's car. He then sets the car on fire. The next day, Jerry informs Stephanie of Bondurant's death, claiming he was in a car accident, and succeeds in bonding with her. Jerry's newfound relationship with his stepdaughter is quickly cut short when he catches Stephanie kissing her boyfriend, Paul. Jerry accuses Paul of attempting to rape Stephanie, which causes an argument with Stephanie and Susan, and drives Paul away. Stephanie runs out on Jerry and Susan because Susan says Jerry is her father, though he is not. The next day, Jerry quits his job and creates a new identity for himself in another town. He begins to court another widow, while planning to get rid of Susan and Stephanie.\n\nHaving discovered where Jerry is now living, Jim  begins going door to door, in search of his former brother-in-law. After Jim stops by, Susan phones the real estate agency to tell Jerry that someone was looking for him, only to be informed that Jerry quit several days ago. Susan asks Jerry, but, while explaining himself to Susan, Jerry confuses his identities and Susan realizes Stephanie was right about him. Realizing his mistake, Jerry bashes Susan on the head with the phone and knocks her down the basement stairs. Content that Susan is dead, Jerry then sets out to kill Stephanie.\n\nJim, who has realized Jerry is the man who killed his family, arrives wielding a revolver, but Jerry stabs him to death before Jim can shoot him. After terrorizing Stephanie, he corners her in the attic, only to fall through the weak floor down to the bathroom. Susan shoots Jerry twice when he tries to attack Stephanie, and Stephanie stabs him in the chest. He weakly utters \"I love you\" and tumbles down the stairs. Stephanie later cuts down a birdhouse she and Jerry had built during the time they bonded.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Jerry Blake / Henry Morrison / Bill Hodgkins / The Stepfather \n* [[Jill Schoelen]] as Stephanie Maine\n* [[Shelley Hack]] as Susan Maine\n* Charles Lanyer as Dr. A.
