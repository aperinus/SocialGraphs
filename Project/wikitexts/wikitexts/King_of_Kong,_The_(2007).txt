It follows [[Steve Wiebe]] in his attempts to take the [[high score]] record for the 1981 arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' from [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]]. The film premiered at the [[2007 Slamdance Film Festival]] and was released in U.S. theaters in August 2007. It received positive reviews.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Walter Day]] is the founder of [[Twin Galaxies]], an organization dedicated to tracking [[Score (game)|high scores]] in [[arcade game]]s, especially those from the [[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age of arcade games]] of the early 1980s. Restaurateur [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]] holds the high score for several arcade games, including the original 1981 release of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.\n\nIn [[Redmond, Washington]], out-of-work engineer [[Steve Wiebe]] has purchased a ''Donkey Kong'' cabinet in hopes of achieving the world record. Using his mathematical knowledge to identify exploitable patterns in the game, Wiebe sets a new record of 947,200 points in 2003. He sends the tape to Twin Galaxies as evidence and becomes a Seattle celebrity.<ref>[https://tdn.com/business/local/redmond-man-is-new-king-of-donkey-kong/article_4025e15b-3c25-5a76-a468-66f5ce6cfbbf.html Redmond man is new king of Donkey Kong]. TDN.com. Retrieved 2020-02-01.</ref> Wiebe sets a new record with a score of 1,006,600 \u2013 the first-ever score over a million.\n\nMitchell and Twin Galaxies send two referees to investigate Wiebe's machine. They learn that the machine's [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] was provided by Roy Shildt, a self-proclaimed fitness guru and [[pickup artist]] who claims the high score for ''[[Missile Command]]''. Unbeknownst to Wiebe, Shildt and Mitchell have been at odds for years after Mitchell questioned Shildt's high score, causing Twin Galaxies to disqualify it. Twin Galaxies suspects that Shildt may have tampered with Wiebe's board, and does not recognize Wiebe's record because it was made on video and using a board which may be questionable due to its association with Shildt.\n\nWiebe travels to a tournament at [[Funspot Family Fun Center|Funspot]] in [[Laconia, New Hampshire]], to attempt a live high score for high-ranking Twin Galaxies members. Wiebe challenges Mitchell to a ''Donkey Kong'' competition, but Mitchell does not attend. Observing that Wiebe is playing a strong game, Brian Kuh proceeds to alert nearby gamers that there could be a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up. Before a crowd, Wiebe sets a new high score of 985,600 and reaches the [[kill screen]], ending the game. However, contrary to his statements that videotaped scores carry less validity than scores achieved in public (which had also been upheld by Twin Galaxies and was in fact the entire reason Wiebe came on site), Mitchell sends his friend Brian Kuh to Funspot with a VHS depicting himself achieving a higher score of 1,047,200 points, which Kuh plays for the patrons and referees at the arcade. In a hypocritical reversal of their new policy on video taped scores, Twin Galaxies proclaims Mitchell the record holder despite some skepticism about the video's authenticity, as head referee Robert Mruczek claims to have noticed the tape jumping from score to score. When Wiebe asks to see the tape himself, Kuh refuses.\n\nNine months later, ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' has published Twin Galaxies' records \u2014 including Mitchell's latest score \u2013 and hosts a tournament in Mitchell's hometown of [[Hollywood, Florida]]. Wiebe again challenges Mitchell to a public competition, but Mitchell refuses. Wiebe fails to surpass the record, but Day acknowledges Wiebe's integrity and invites him to submit taped scores. At home, Wiebe achieves a new record of 1,049,100.\n\n==Appearances==\n* [[Steve Wiebe]], the challenger\n* [[Billy Mitchell (video game player)|Billy Mitchell]], described in the film as \"the world's best gamer\"\n* [[Walter Day]], the founder of [[Twin Galaxies]]\n* Robert Mruczek, the chief referee of Twin Galaxies\n* Brian Kuh, friend of Billy Mitchell and ''Donkey Kong'' player\n* Steve Sanders, friend of Billy Mitchell and ''Donkey Kong'' player\n* Dwayne Richard, classic gaming World Champion\n* Roy Shildt (aka \"Mr. Awesome\"), Billy Mitchell's \"nemesis\"\n* [[Todd Rogers (electronic sports player)|Todd Rogers]]\n* Greg Bond, ''[[Mappy]]'' champion\n* [[Doris Self]], previous holder of the ''[[Q*bert]]'' record and title of oldest game champion\n* Wiebe Family\n\n== Release ==\n''The King of Kong'' premiered January 22, 2007, at the [[2007 Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance Film Festival]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074956/http://slamdance.com/2007/festival/film_detail.asp?film_id=994 The King of Kong - Slamdance Film Festival 2007].
