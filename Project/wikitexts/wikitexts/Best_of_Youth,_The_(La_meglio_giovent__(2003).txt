A [[family saga]] set in Italy from 1966 through 2003, it chronicles the life of the middle-class Carati family, focusing primarily on brothers Nicola ([[Luigi Lo Cascio]]) and Matteo ([[Alessio Boni]]) as their life paths separate during youth, encompassing major political and social events in [[History of the Italian Republic|post\u2013World War II Italian history]].\n\nOriginally conceived as a [[RAI|Rai]] television miniseries, it premiered at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Un Certain Regard|Prize Un Certain Regard]]. It was then given a theatrical release in Italy as two 3-hour films (titled ''Act I'' and ''Act II''), before being aired with broader success on [[Rai 1]] in a slightly longer four-episode television version later that year. In the U.S., the film was released by [[Miramax]] in its theatrical version.\n\nThe title of the film, an ungrammatical rendition of ''La miglior giovent\u00f9'' (\"the best youth/young people\"), comes from the title of a 1954 [[Friulian language]] poetry collection by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who in turn borrowed it from a line of [[Alpini]] World War II song ''Sul ponte di Perati'';<ref name=\"stampa\"/> here, Giordana uses it to refer to [[Baby boomers|his generation]], which is also the main characters' one, made up of those young people who participated in the ''[[Sessantotto]]''.<ref name=\"stampa\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n===Summer 1966===\nTwo brothers go their separate ways after attempting to rescue a young girl, Giorgia ([[Jasmine Trinca]]), from an abusive sanitarium. The brothers are Matteo and Nicola Carati ([[Alessio Boni]] and [[Luigi Lo Cascio]]). Their parents are Angelo (Andrea Tidona) and Adriana ([[Adriana Asti]]), their older sister is Giovanna (Lidia Vitale), and their younger sister is Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti). Their friends, their lovers and others drift through, including Giorgia who struggles with mental issues, but whose life seems to follow in parallel.\n\nMatteo walks out of his first exam, while Nicola passes an exam on his way to qualifying as a doctor (and will pursue a career in [[psychiatry]]). Matteo takes mental patients for walks to help them begin to feel normal and takes a particular interest in his patient Giorgia. Noticing that Giorgia has been wounded by [[electroshock]] therapy, he decides to remove her from the [[institution]] and take her along with him and Nicola&mdash;who are about to go on a trip to [[Norway]].\n\nEventually, Giorgia is captured by the police and taken back to the [[Insane asylum|asylum]]. Matteo, filled with sadness and depression, returns to [[Rome]] and joins the army.  Nicola continues to Norway and gets a job as a [[lumberjack]]. The brothers meet again in [[Florence]] just after the 1966 [[Flood of the River Arno in Florence|Arno River flood]]. Here, Nicola meets a university student, Giulia ([[Sonia Bergamasco]]).\n\n===February 1968===\nNicola and Giulia are living together in [[Turin]], but the two do not marry.\n\n===1974===\nMatteo leaves the army and joins the police force. During this time, Matteo shows signs of continuing depression and anger. He accepts an assignment in [[Sicily]], a place corrupted by the Mafia. Meanwhile, Nicola and Giulia conceive and care for Sara, their daughter.\n\n===1977===\nIn Sicily, Matteo meets a photographer in a ''caff\u00e8'' named Mirella ([[Maya Sansa]]). She wants to be a librarian, and he advises her to work at a beautiful library in Rome.\n\nBecause of his temper, Matteo is forced to leave Sicily. He decides to reside in Rome but refuses to visit his mother.\n\nMeanwhile, Nicola becomes a psychiatrist, and works to eliminate the abuse and maltreatment of patients in mental hospitals. He finds Giorgia in one of these hospitals. She is tied to a bed in inhumane conditions, does not talk, and shows fear of being touched by others.\nAfter some time, Giulia gets drawn into a secret [[Red Brigades]] [[covert cell|cell]]. One night, she leaves Nicola and Sara and disappears into the [[terrorist]] underground.\n\n===1983===\nYears later Matteo walks into that same library and sees Mirella for the second time. They fall in love, and one evening, make love in a car.  Eventually he pushes her away.\n\n===December 1983===\nMirella meets with Matteo with news for him, but he behaves harshly and forces her to leave. On New Year's Eve, Matteo decides to finally visit his mother. Everyone is there to celebrate. Instead of waiting for the traditional toasts, however, Matteo decides to leave early and, at midnight, jumps off the balcony of his apartment and kills himself.\n\nThe family is devastated by the tragedy. No longer motivated, Nicola's mother quits her teaching job and lives a life in solitude in Rome. Nicola, feeling that he could have saved Matteo and not wanting to make the same mistake again, arranges for the capture of Giulia to prevent her from killing someone else or from getting killed. She is sentenced to 17 years in jail. During her jail term, Nicola visits Giulia and proposes to her but is rejected.\n\n===Spring 1992===\nNicola finds a photograph of Matteo taken by Mirella. He is encouraged by Giorgia to meet with Mirella which, after some hesitation, he agrees to do. When he meets Mirella, Nicola learns about her son (Andrea) and that Matteo was the father. Nicola breaks this exciting news to his mother and they visit Mirella and the boy on the small island of Stromboli. Inspired by new meaning in her life, Nicola's mother decides to stay with Mirella and her grandson.\n\n===Spring 1995===\nNicola and his friends acquire and plan the reconstruction of an old villa house in Tuscany. Giulia (out of jail) meets Francesca but chooses not to talk to Sara, watching her from afar. Meanwhile, Sara, now in her early twenties, is still struggling with the poor choices her mother has made. She decides to move to Rome to study [[Conservation-restoration|art conservation]] and becomes engaged to Mimmo. During this time, Nicola finds out his mother has died and, as a result, travels to Stromboli to visit Mirella and pay his respects.\n\n===Spring 2000===\nHaving finally moved past the death of Matteo, Nicola and Mirella fall in love. Sara, now happy and strong, is encouraged by Nicola to confront her mother and try to patch things up. Giulia, in desperate need of love, embraces Sara, but is not ready to open up completely.\n\n===2003===\nThe film ends with Matteo's son, Andrea, visiting [[Norway]], specifically [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]], which is where his father and Nicola ventured to go at the beginning of the movie, but never completed their journey.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- per closing credits' billing -->\n{{Columns-start}}\n*[[Luigi Lo Cascio]] as Nicola Carati\n*[[Alessio Boni]] as Matteo Carati\n*[[Jasmine Trinca]] as Giorgia\n*[[Adriana Asti]] as Adriana Carati\n*[[Sonia Bergamasco]] as Giulia Monfalco\n*[[Fabrizio Gifuni]] as Carlo Tommasi\n*[[Maya Sansa]] as Mirella Utano\n*[[Valentina Carnelutti]] as Francesca Carati\n**Nila Carnelutti as Francesca Carati at 8\n*[[Andrea Tidona]] as Angelo Carati\n*[[Lidia Vitale]] as Giovanna Carati\n*[[Claudio Gio\u00e8]] as Vitale Micavi\n*Paolo Bonanni as Luigino\n*[[Giovanni Scifoni]] as Berto\n*[[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as Andrea Utano\n**Francesco La Macchia as Andrea Utano at 6\n*[[Camilla Filippi]] as Sara Carati\n**Greta Cavuoti as Sara Carati at 8\n**Sara Pavoncello as Sara Carati at 5\n*[[Mario Schiano]] as medicine professor\n{{Column}}\n*Michele Melega as literature professor\n*Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Vadem as Therese\n*[[Stefano Abbati]] as pusher\n*Giovanni Martorana as Maghrebi\n*[[Paolo De Vita]] as Don Vito\n*Mimmo Mignemi as Giorgia's father\n*Domenico Centamore as Officer Enzo\n*Pippo Montalbano\u00a0as Police Chief in Palermo\n*Gaspare Cucinella\u00a0as 'Viddanu\n*Dario Veca\u00a0as butcher\n*Nicola Vigilante\u00a0as nurse\n*Marcello Prayer\u00a0as Second Lieutenant\n*Walter Da Pozzo\u00a0as Officer Mario\n*Krum De Nicola\u00a0as Brigo\n*Maurizio Di Carmine\u00a0as terrorist\n*[[Roberto Accornero]]\u00a0as President of the Court in Turin\n*Fabio Camilli\u00a0as [[Mani pulite|Tangentopoli]] inmate\n*Antonello Puglisi\u00a0as priest in Palermo\n*Patrizia Punzo\u00a0as gallery manager\n*Emilia Marra\u00a0as doctor\n{{Columns-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Principal photography]] began in March 2002,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/03/05/torino-hollywood.html?ref=search|title=Torino, Hollywood|trans-title=Turin, Hollywood|first=Luca|last=Iaccarino|work=[[La Repubblica]]|date=5 March 2002|access-date=9 March 2021|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/03/20/la-candidatura-come-protagonista-di-luce-dei.html?ref=search|title=La candidatura come protagonista di 'Luce dei miei occhi'|trans-title=The Best Lead Actor nomination for 'Luce dei miei occhi'|work=[[La Repubblica]]|date=20 March 2002|access-date=9 March 2021|language=it}}</ref> taking place mainly in [[Florence]], [[Turin]] and [[Collegno]] in the following months.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/04/14/giordana-sogni-sconfitte-di-una-bella-generazione.html?ref=search|title=Giordana: sogni e sconfitte di una bella generazione|trans-title=Giordana: dreams e defeats of a beautiful generation|first=Silvia|last=Fumarola|work=[[La Repubblica]]|date=14 April 2002|access-date=9 March 2021|language=it}}</ref><ref name=\"tor\">{{cite news|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,126/articleid,0178_08_2003_0763_0126_1297147/|title=Una famiglia torinese|trans-title=A family from Turin|first=Daniele|last=Cavalla|work=[[La Stampa]]|p=126|date=5 December 2003|access-date=9 March 2021|language=it}}</ref><ref name=\"ciak\">{{cite news|url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/05/10/ciak-giordana-gira-la-meglio-gioventu.to_061ciak.html?ref=search|title=Ciak, Giordana gira 'La meglio giovent\u00f9'|trans-title=Action!
