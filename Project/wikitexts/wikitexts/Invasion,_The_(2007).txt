The plot follows a psychiatrist (Kidman) in [[Washington, D.C.]] who finds those around her turning into emotionless beings shortly after a major space shuttle crash.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 2004. [[Warner Bros.]] hired David Kajganich to write what was intended to be a remake of the 1956 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', but Kajganich crafted a different story as an original conception and to reflect contemporary times. Principal photography began in September 2005. The film was released on August 17, 2007, to received mixed-to-negative reviews and grossed $40.2 million against a $65\u201380 million budget, making it a [[List of biggest box-office bombs|failure in the box office sales]] and loss for Warner Bros' $71 million projectors.\n\n''The Invasion'' is the fourth [[film adaptation]] of the 1955 novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' by [[Jack Finney]], following [[Invasion of the Body Snatchers|1956 film]]  [[Don Siegel]]'s,  [[Philip Kaufman]]'s  a remake of [[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'']] (1978), and [[Abel Ferrara]]'s 1993 ''[[Body Snatchers (1993 film)|Body Snatchers]].''\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a [[Space Shuttle]] crashes on Earth, a fungus-like alien lifeform is discovered on the remaining parts scattered widely over the United States. Once people are infected by the organism, and [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]] occurs, the organism takes control. One of the first people infected is Tucker Kaufman, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] director investigating the crash.\n\nTucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell, begins to feel something is amiss when people seem to have \"changed\". Her patient, Wendy Lenk (played by [[Veronica Cartwright]], who appeared in the 1978 film version as Nancy Bellicec), describes how her husband \"is not (her) husband\", and one of Carol's son's friends acts detached and emotionless.\n\nAt a neighborhood [[Halloween]] party, Carol's son Oliver finds an unusual patch of \"skin\" on a partier, which is initially believed to be costume makeup. Carol speculates that the skin may be connected to reports of a fast-spreading flu. Carol takes the sample to her doctor friend Ben Driscoll to have it analyzed. Carol and Oliver later witness a car accident where a troubled woman is killed. Carol approaches the crash scene to give a witness statement, but an emotionless cop takes down her plates and orders her back to her car. Afterwards, Carol drops Oliver off at Tucker's house for the weekend.\n\nLater, that night, Ben and Carol attend a friendly dinner meeting between Russian diplomat Yorish and Czech diplomat Belicec (along with his wife Luddie). Carol and Yorish debate the violent nature of humans over caviar and champagne. Meanwhile, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu vaccine and Carol, upon returning home, is attacked by a \"census department\" worker who tries to break into her house.\n\nBen and Dr. Stephen Galeano, a biologist, discover how the spore takes over the brain during REM sleep. During this investigation, Luddie calls Ben, worried about Yorish's behavior. Driscoll and Galeano also find that people who had brain-affecting illnesses, such as [[encephalitis]] or [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis|ADEM]], are immune to the spore because their previous illnesses prevent the spore from \"latching on\" to the brain matter. Oliver is immune to the spore because of the ADEM he had as a young child. Carol decides to get her son, who might show a way to a cure, back from Tucker. Before she drives to Tucker's house, she joins Ben's team who is called to the house of the Belicecs, the Czech ambassador and his wife, in a case of emergency. There they witness the transformation of Yorish (the Russian ambassador) and the Belicecs' friend.\n\nWhen Carol arrives at Tucker's house, he and several colleagues close in on her. He explains that the changed humans, devoid of irrational emotions, are offering a better world, and asks her to join them. When Carol resists, Tucker holds her to the ground and infects her by spurting his saliva on her. She escapes and returns to Ben at the Belicecs' house. They flee when Belicec returns with more transformed people intent on infecting anyone in the house.\n\nGaleano and one of his assistants head to [[Fort Detrick]] in Frederick, Maryland, where they and other scientists will attempt to find a cure for the virus. Carol and Ben separate to find Oliver, who texts his location, the apartment of Tucker's mother, to Carol. Carol goes there and manages to spirit Oliver away, but is again pursued by Tucker, whom she has to kill to stop.\n\nCarol arranges to meet up with Ben, but it takes a while for him to show, and Carol almost falls asleep, but Oliver saves her. Ben arrives, but Carol finds he too has 'converted'. He attempts to seduce her to give in to the new society that has no crime, war, or violence, but also frankly states that there is no room for people like Oliver who are immune. Carol shoots Ben in the leg and flees with Oliver. They are pursued, but finally she and Oliver are picked up by helicopter, and flown to the medical center. A vaccine is created, inoculations are made world-wide, and within a year the alien virus is eliminated. Carol and Ben reunite, Ben having no memory of the events, and society reverts to its normal emotional and violent ways.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Carol Bennell\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Dr. Ben Driscoll\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Tucker Kaufman\n* Jackson Bond as Oliver\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Dr. Stephen Galeano\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Wendy Lenk\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Dr. Henryk Belicec\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Ludmilla Belicec\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Yorish Kagonavich\n* Eric Benjamin as Gene\n* [[Susan Floyd]] as Pam\n* Stephanie Berry as Carly\n* Alexis Raben as Jill\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Richard Lenk\n* [[Joanna Merlin]] as Joan Kaufman\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Autumn (uncredited)\n* [[Jeff Wincott]] as Transit Cop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nIn March 2004, [[Warner Bros.]] hired screenwriter [[David Kajganich]] to write a script that would serve as a remake of the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Cathy Dunkley |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117902307.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Scribe warms to WB's 'Body' |work=Variety |date=March 25, 2004 |access-date=April 28, 2007}}</ref> In July 2005, director [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]] was attached to helm the project, with production to begin in [[Edgemere, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=10400 |title=''Body Snatchers'' Get a Director |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=July 15, 2005 |access-date=April 28, 2007}}</ref> The following August, Nicole Kidman was cast to star in the film then titled ''Invasion'', receiving a salary of close to $17&nbsp;million.
