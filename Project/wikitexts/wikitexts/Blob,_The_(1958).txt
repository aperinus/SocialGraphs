It stars [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] (in his first [[feature film]] leading role) and [[Aneta Corsaut]] and co-stars Earl Rowe and [[Olin Howland]]. It was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[I Married a Monster from Outer Space]]''.\n\nThe film concerns a carnivorous [[amoeba|amoeboidal]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] that crashes to Earth from outer space inside a [[meteorite]], landing near the small communities of [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]] and [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania]].  It envelops living beings, growing larger, becoming redder in color, and more aggressive, eventually becoming larger than a building.\n\nIt is the first film in [[The Blob (film series)|''The Blob'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a small [[Pennsylvania]] town in July 1957, teenager Steve Andrews and his girlfriend Jane Martin kiss at a [[lovers' lane]] when they see a meteorite crash beyond the next hill. Steve goes looking for it but Barney, an old man living nearby, finds it first. When he pokes the meteorite with a stick, it breaks open and a small jelly-like globule blob inside attaches itself to his hand. In pain and unable to scrape or shake it loose, Barney runs onto the road, where he is nearly struck by Steve's car. Steve and Jane take him to Doctor Hallen.\n\nDoctor Hallen anesthetizes the man and sends Steve and Jane back to locate the impact site and gather information. Hallen decides he must amputate the man's arm since it is being [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]]. Before he can, the Blob completely absorbs Barney, then Hallen's nurse Kate, and finally the doctor himself, growing redder and larger with each victim. Steve and Jane return in time for Steve to witness the doctor trying to escape through the window with the Blob covering him. They go to the police station and return with Lieutenant Dave Barton and Sergeant Jim Bert, but they find no sign of the Blob or its victims. The skeptical Bert dismisses Steve's story as a prank. Steve and Jane are taken home by their parents, but they later sneak out.\n\nThe Blob absorbs a mechanic at a repair shop. During a midnight screening of ''[[Dementia (1955 film)|Daughter of Horror]]'' at the [[Colonial Theatre (Phoenixville, Pennsylvania)|Colonial Theater]], Steve recruits Tony and his friends to warn people about the Blob. When Steve notices that his father's grocery store is unlocked, he and Jane go inside to investigate. The janitor is nowhere to be seen. The couple is quickly cornered by the Blob and they seek refuge in the walk-in freezer. The Blob oozes in under the door but quickly retreats. Steve and Jane gather their friends and set off the town's fire and [[Air raid siren|air-raid]] alarms. The responding townspeople and police still refuse to believe them. The Blob enters the Colonial Theater and envelopes the projectionist, then oozes into the auditorium. Steve is finally vindicated when screaming people flee the theater in panic.\n\nSteve, Jane and her kid brother Danny are trapped in a [[diner]], along with the owner and a waitress, as the Blob&mdash;now enormous from the people it has consumed&mdash;engulfs the diner. Dave taps into the diner's telephone with his police radio and warns those in the diner to shelter in the cellar before the police bring down a live power line onto the Blob.\n\nDave and Bert plan to electrocute the Blob by felling an overhead high-voltage power line. It discharges a massive electrical current into the blob, which is unaffected, but the diner underneath it is set ablaze. When the diner owner uses a carbon dioxide extinguisher on the approaching fire inside, Steve notices that the Blob recoils. Steve remembers it also retreated from the freezer and realizes it cannot tolerate cold temperatures. Shouting in hopes of being picked up on the open phone line, Steve tells Dave about the Blob's vulnerability to cold. The firemen have a limited supply of {{Chem2|CO2}} fire extinguishers. Jane's father, high school principal Henry Martin, leads Steve's friends to break into the school to retrieve its extinguishers. When they return, a brigade of fire extinguisher-armed students, firemen and police drive the Blob away from the diner, freeing the five trapped there, and surround and freeze the creature.\n\nDave requests authorities send an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] heavy-lift cargo aircraft to transport the frozen Blob to the [[Arctic]]. Dave realizes that the cold will stop the Blob but not kill it, \u201c[[Climate change in the Arctic|as long as the Arctic stays cold]]\u201d. Parachutes bearing the Blob on a pallet lower it onto an Arctic ice field with the superimposed words ''The End'' morphing into a question mark.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] (credited as Steven McQueen) as Steve Andrews\n* [[Aneta Corsaut|Aneta Corseaut]] as Jane Martin\n* Earl Rowe as Lt.

After hearing that cartoonist [[Walt Kelly]] had used ''The Glob'' as a title for his [[Walt Kelly#Pogo|Pogo children's book]], they mistakenly believed that they couldn't use that title, so they changed it to ''The Blob''.<ref name=\"Biodrowski\">Biodrowski, Steve.

'The one that used to get all the laughs when people repeated it,' recalled Harris, 'was THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE. We had another one: ABSORBINE SENIOR. I liked that. And, THE NIGHT OF THE CREEPING DREAD. We were really serious about that one, because it was a \u2018tuxedo\u2019 title; THE GLOB THAT GIRDLED THE GLOBE was a \u2018dumb\u2019 title.

We were applying for copyright, and somebody had done a little investigation and found there was a book called ''The Glob'', by Walt Kelly, the cartoonist. I didn\u2019t know any better then.

For the diner scene, a photograph of the building was put on a gyroscopically operated table onto which cameras had been mounted. The table was shaken and the Blob rolled off. When the film negative was printed in reverse, it appeared to be oozing over the building.{{#tag:ref|The setting is apparently Downingtown, Pennsylvania itself as the one policeman identifies his department's office as \"Downingtown HQ to East Cornwall HQ\" over the two-way radio during his chess game, and the final scenes take place in a restaurant that is clearly labeled \"Downingtown Diner\".|group=Note}} ''The Blob'' was filmed in color and projected at a 1.85 ratio.\n\nTwenty-eight-year-old Steve McQueen received $3,000 for his starring role. He turned down an offer for a smaller up-front fee in return for a 10% percent share of profits, thinking that the film would never make money; he needed his signing fee immediately to pay for food and rent.

Audiences liked it, but critics were not as kind. ''[[The New York Times]]'' highlighted some of its problems and identified some positives, although Steve McQueen's debut was not one of them. On director Irvin Yeaworth's work, they wrote: <blockquote>\"Unfortunately, his picture talks itself to death, even with the blob nibbling away at everybody in sight. And most of his trick effects, under the direction of Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr., look pretty phony. On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small town background\u2014a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry).
