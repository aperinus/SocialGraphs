Pecker, named for his childhood habit of \"pecking\" at his food, becomes unexpectedly popular when savvy New York art dealer Rorey Wheeler \"discovers\" his work.  Pecker's pictures, taken with a cheap [[Canonet|Canon Canonet 28]], are grainy, out-of-focus studies of unglamorous subjects, but they strike a chord with New York art collectors.\n\nUnfortunately, Pecker discovers that instant over-exposure has its downsides.  Rorey's efforts to turn Pecker into an art sensation threaten to ruin the low-key lifestyle that inspired him.  He abandons his trusty old [[rangefinder camera]] for a new, full-featured [[Nikon F50|Nikon N50]].  Pecker finds that his best friend, Matt, can't [[Theft|shoplift]] anymore because Pecker's photographs have increased his visibility.  Shelley, Pecker's obsessive girlfriend who runs a laundromat, seems especially distressed when the press dub her a \"stain goddess\", mistaking her good-natured \"[[pin-up]]\" poses for pornographic come-ons. \t\n\nWhen an overzealous critic dubs Pecker's family \"culturally challenged\", they begin to feel the uncomfortable glare of stardom.  His mother Joyce can no longer freely dispense fashion tips to the homeless clientele at her thrift shop; his grandmother, Memama, endures public ridicule when her experience with a talking statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] is exposed on the cover of a national art magazine, and his older sister Tina is fired from her job [[emcee]]ing [[go-go dancing]] at a [[gay bar]] because Pecker's edgy photographs chronicle the sex practices of the club's patrons.  Even Little Chrissy, his six-year-old sister, feels the pressure of celebrity when her eating disorder is exposed, bringing unwanted attention from nosy child welfare agencies, and she is mistakenly diagnosed with [[Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] and prescribed [[Ritalin]].\n\nHaving seen his new-found fame disrupt the lives of his family and friends, Pecker upsets the art world by refusing to participate in a scheduled show at the [[Whitney Museum of Art]].  Instead, he forces New York art collectors to come to Baltimore to see his latest photographs, which insultingly portray the same people who disparaged his family, with one photo showing Lynn Wentworth adjusting her breasts in a mirror.\n\nAsked what he plans to do next, Pecker replies that he would like to direct a film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Pecker\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Shelley\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Rorey Wheeler\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Joyce\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Tina\n* [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Matt\n* [[Bess Armstrong]] as Dr. Klompus\n* Lauren Hulsey as Little Chrissy\n* Mark Joy as Jimmy\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Precinct Captain\n* [[Patricia Hearst]] as Lynn Wentworth\n* Jean Schertler as Memama\n* Alan J.
