It was directed by [[W.S. Van Dyke]] and starred [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]], all three of whom were prominently involved in the ''[[The Thin Man|Thin Man]]'' film series.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1940, while on a cruise, stodgy, overly frugal businessman Larry Wilson is hit on the head with an oar while rescuing a drunk \"Doc\" Ryan from the water. He wakes up and remembers that he is actually a suave [[conman]] named George Carey. George's last memory is of going to place a large bet in 1931.\n\nWhen the ship docks at New York, he is met by Kay, whom he discovers is his wife. She however is in the process of divorcing him to marry Herbert. They go home to the small town of Habersville, Pennsylvania. George talks Doc (who is also a con artist) into masquerading as a physician treating him, partly out of curiosity, but mostly because of greed, after seeing the enormous balance in his checking account. That turns out to be a dead end (the money is only held in trust for the [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]]), so he decides to swindle people using his [[alter ego]]'s sterling reputation. He sends for his old crony Duke Sheldon, who plants oil on a lot George owns.\n\nA complication arises when he falls in love with Kay a second time. She however wants nothing further to do with her boring cheapskate of a husband. George attempts to win back Kay's affections, while also trying to sell his land to several greedy leading citizens of the town. George uses his other persona as a celebrated [[Outdoor recreation#Outdoor enthusiast|woodsman]] to have his troop of Junior Rangers (many of them the sons of local businessmen) stumble upon the oil. This gets back to their fathers, who quickly offer to buy the land.\n\nIn the end, wanting to remain with Kay who now loves him as George, he decides to abort the swindle, but Duke will not let him. They fight, and George is knocked out by a punch. When he comes to, he seems to be Larry once more. Duke leaves in disgust, but having hooked the biggest scammer of the citizens in a side deal. When Doc muses that one knock on the head reversed the effect of another, Kay, who knows all and wants George back, picks up a vase. Before she can bring it down on his head, \"Larry\" proves that he was only faking to get rid of Duke.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- for style guidelines plz see WP:FILMCAST -->\n* [[William Powell]] as Lawrence 'Larry' Wilson / George Carey\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Katherine 'Kay' Wilson\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as 'Doc' Ryan\n* [[Edmund Lowe]] as Duke Sheldon\n* [[Don Douglas|Donald Douglas]] as Herbert\n* [[Nella Walker]] as Kay's mother\n* [[Carl Switzer|Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer]] as Leonard Harkspur Jr.\n* [[Pierre Watkin]] as W.H.

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised the film writing: \"Mr. Powell and Miss Loy, no matter what their names, are one of our most versatile and frisky connubial comedy teams, and, given a script as daffy as the one here in evidence, they can make an hour and a half spin like a roulette wheel.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=I Love You Again (1940) THE SCREEN; William Powell and Myrna Loy Back Together in 'I Love You Again,' at the Capitol. |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 16, 1940 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803EEDC133EE432A25755C1A96E9C946193D6CF}}</ref> W.S from ''Motion Picture Daily'' stated that the audience was in \"continuous laughter and applause throughout the film\" and claimed that \u201cM-G-M has made the funniest motion picture this industry has seen in 10 years.\"\n\nOther critics agreed. Laura Lee, critic for the '' Philadelphia Bulletin'', wrote, \"Too ridiculous for words, but \u2018I Love You Again\u2019 is extremely funny. You may feel silly for laughing but laugh you must.\" Gilbert Kanour of the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'' said, \"William Powell and Myrna Loy have lost none of their skill in provoking laughter...a witty and inventive plot.\"\n\nAccording to ''Motion Picture Daily,'' the film did above average business at the box office during its first two weeks.\n\n== Radio adaptations ==\n''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' adapted the film twice, first in 1941 with Loy and [[Cary Grant]], then in 1948 with Powell and [[Ann Sothern]] (Loy was supposed to reprise her film role in this adaptation, but had to drop out due to retakes on a film).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/221/I-Love-You-Again/notes.html |title=I Love You Again (1940): Notes |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0032617}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|id=221}}\n* {{AllMovie title|id=24099}}\n* {{AFI film|id=5062|title=I Love You Again}}\n\n{{W.
