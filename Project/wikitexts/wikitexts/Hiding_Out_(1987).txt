After an evening out at a bar, one of them is killed in his home. The next morning, the FBI take the other two into [[protective custody]].\n\nConvincing his FBI bodyguards to have breakfast out of the [[safe house]], Andrew and the agents are followed by hitmen. One of the bodyguards is killed in the diner, the other injured, and Andrew flees the scene. While running from the hitmen, he boards a train, temporarily escaping. Andrew hitchhikes with a truck driver to [[Topsail, Delaware]], where he phones his Aunt Lucy, who tells him to meet her at the high school where she is the nurse.\n\nShaving his beard and bleaching the sides of his hair blonde give Andrew a punk look. He trades his $500 Italian sports coat for a peacoat from a bum to complete the look. Arriving at Topsail High School, the office personnel, mistake him for a new student and register him for classes. He takes the name of Maxwell Hauser (off a [[Maxwell House]] coffee can).\n\nAndrew's cousin does not recognize him at first. He eventually pulls him aside, revealing himself. He also sleeps at Patrick's, unbeknownst to his aunt.\n\nNot willing to take the teachers' attitudes, Andrew becomes a hero to those tired of the school's status quo. This upsets Kevin O'Roarke, the current class president, and captures the heart of Ryan Campbell. During an afternoon at the local diner, he accidentally drops a [[birthday card]] meant for his grandmother (who had raised him) and it gets mailed. Later, a hitman posing as an FBI agent contacts his grandmother and sees the card and its postmark, telling him where Andrew is hiding.\n\nOne night, back from a date with Ryan, Patrick stops Andrew from entering the house. FBI agents have arrived, knowing he is close because he used his ATM card. Patrick takes his mother's keys and Andrew ends up using the high school as his refuge. He meets the school janitor, Ezzard, and shares a drink with him, revealing who he is. Andrew embraces the opportunity to run for class president, not knowing the election committee has already decided to rig the results in favor of Kevin.\n\nBored with high school, and realising he is the last witness against the mobster, Andrew decides to drop out. During the presentation of class election results, Kevin is announced the winner. However, he demands a recount, which reveals that most want Andrew as class president. As Andrew starts to address the crowd, a hitman begins firing at the stage. Ezzard, watching the proceedings, manages to dispose of one of the hitmen, while the other moves up into the rafters of the gym. Andrew chases him and Patrick uses a spotlight to blind the hitman, who loses his grip and falls to the gym floor below.\n\nImages of graduation are spliced into images of Andrew taking the stand in court against the mobster for whom he had sold the bogus bonds. After his testimony, Andrew is given a few minutes to say farewell to his grandmother before being placed in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]].\n\nThe last scene is of Ryan, sitting under a tree at a university. Andrew, now known as Eddie Collins, appears from behind the tree and tells her he has decided to become a teacher.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jon Cryer]] as Andrew Morenski/Maxwell Hauser\n*[[Keith Coogan]] as Patrick Morenski\n*[[Annabeth Gish]] as Ryan Campbell\n* Claude Brooks as Clinton\n*[[Oliver Cotton]] as Killer\n*[[Tim Quill]] as Kevin O'Roarke\n*Tony Soper as Ahern\n*[[Ned Eisenberg]] as Rodriguez\n*[[Marita Geraghty]] as Janie Rooney\n*[[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Bakey\n*[[Gretchen Cryer]] as Lucy Morenski\n*[[Anne Pitoniak]] as Grandma Jennie\n*[[Beth Ehlers]] as Chloe\n*[[Richard Portnow]] as Mr. Lessig\n*[[Gerry Bamman]] as Mr. Stevens\n*[[Jack Gilpin]] as Dr. Gusick \n*[[Joy Behar]] as Gertrude\n*Lou Walker as Ezzard\n\n==Soundtrack==\nFour songs from the film's soundtrack entered the record charts in the United States: \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]] (re-recorded as a duet with [[k.d. lang]]<ref>Lang much later wrote about the experience of recording ''Crying'' with Orbison in [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414204602/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939233/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_37_roy_orbison The Immortals - The Greatest Artists of All Time: 37) Roy Orbison], from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine</ref>); \"Live My Life\" by [[Boy George]]; \"[[Catch Me (I'm Falling)]]\" by [[Pretty Poison (group)|Pretty Poison]], which went top ten in the US and also topped the Billboard [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in September 1987; and the top-20 U.S. hit \"You Don't Know\" by [[Scarlett and Black]]. The UK hit \"Seattle\" by [[Public Image Ltd.]] was also recorded in 1987 and featured in the film.\n\n==Reception==\nRoger Ebert compared the film to ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', also released in 1987, in that it was an \"example of the newest Hollywood genre, the Generation Squeeze, in which plots artificially combine adult and teenage elements\" in order to attract the latter to the movie theater while attracting enough of an adult audience for the success of the rental market.<ref name=\"ebert\">[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hiding-out-1987 Review of ''Hiding Out''] by [[Roger Ebert]]</ref>  Ebert describes as \"dumb\" the main [[plot device]] involving the gangsters' continuing pursuit of Andrew, and the [[story arc]] about the janitor he befriends, and notes that the film fails to depict how the 29-year-old protagonist could have much in common with Gish's character, who is over 10 years younger than he is.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> He credited the film with getting him to wonder what it would be like to revisit one's high school years, but cites ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married (film)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' from 1986 as a film that had portrayed that scenario much more successfully.<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\nJanet Maslin called the film \"pleasant enough\" with \"mild\" jokes that \"revolve around things such as Mr. Cryer's accidentally giving tax advice to the father of a teenage girl he's dating, or his feeling out of place at the roller rink.\" She thought the film's conclusion suggested that Cryer \"could have unexpected charm in more adult roles.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF1339F935A35752C1A961948260 Review of ''Hiding Out''] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nThe Time Out Film Guide called the film \"predictable, slackly plotted nonsense, marginally redeemed by a genial young cast.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/72009/hiding-out.html Review of ''Hiding Out''] from the [[Time Out (company)|Time Out Film Guide]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0093186|Hiding Out}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|22349|Hiding Out}}\n* {{Mojo title|hidingout}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|hiding_out}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1987 independent films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about organized crime in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Anne Dudley]]\n[[Category:Films set in Delaware]]\n[[Category:1987 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1987 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1987 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bob Giraldi]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
