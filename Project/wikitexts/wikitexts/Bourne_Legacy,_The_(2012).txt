The film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross (portrayed by [[Jeremy Renner]]), an original character. In addition to Renner, the film stars [[Rachel Weisz]] and [[Edward Norton]].\n\nThe titular character [[Jason Bourne]] does not appear in ''The Bourne Legacy'', as actor [[Matt Damon]] chose not to return for the fourth film, due to [[Paul Greengrass]] not directing. Bourne is shown in pictures and mentioned by name several times throughout the film. Tony Gilroy, co-screenwriter of the first three films, sought to continue the story of the film series without changing its key events, and parts of ''The Bourne Legacy'' take place at the same time as the previous film, ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007). Aaron Cross is a member of a black ops program called Operation Outcome whose subjects are genetically enhanced. He must run for his life once former CIA Treadstone agent Jason Bourne's actions lead to the public exposure of [[Jason_Bourne#Operation_Treadstone|Operation Treadstone]] and its successor Operation Blackbriar.\n\nFilming was primarily in [[New York City]], with some scenes shot in the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Canada]]. Released on {{nowrap|August 10}}, 2012, the film received generally favorable reviews and grossed $276 million at the box office. It was followed in 2016 by ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'', with Damon reprising his role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|Six weeks after Jason Bourne's escape from Russia after his pursuit with Kirill]], Operation Outcome agent Aaron Cross is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise. He is forced to traverse the rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for skipping mandatory check-ins for four days. He elects to take a shortcut across a mountain pass to avoid a pack of wolves and arrives at the cabin two days early.  The cabin is operated by Number Three, another Outcome agent who is also being punished.  Cross lies and tells Number Three that he has lost his program medications, known as \"chems\", that all agents must take to keep their mental and physical enhancements.\n\nColonel Eric Byer is tasked with containing the fallout from Pam Landy's exposure of Operations [[Jason_Bourne#Operation_Treadstone|Treadstone]] and Blackbriar.  His team finds a series of videos posted online that could lead investigators to Operation Outcome.  Byer orders Operation Outcome to be completely shut down, with all of the agents and participating doctors killed.\n\nByer deploys a [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to eliminate Cross and Number Three in Alaska. The base cabin is destroyed, with Number Three killed and Cross thrown clear of the blast and surviving.  He finds and removes his tracking implant and forces a wolf to swallow it. A followup drone which Cross has anticipated kills the wolf, not Cross, and everyone is deceived into believing Cross is dead.  Other Outcome agents are eliminated when they are given poisonous yellow pills disguised as new chems by their handlers.  At Sterisyn Morlanta, the pharmaceutical company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite snaps and starts killing the other doctors working on Outcome.   After being cornered by guards, Foite shoots himself, leaving Dr. Marta Shearing as the sole survivor.\n\nFour D-trac assassins sent by Byer and disguised as federal agents visit Dr. Shearing at her home and attempt to murder her and make it look like a suicide.  They are interrupted by Cross, who kills the entire team.  Cross asks Dr. Shearing for chems but she doesn't have any.  They pour [[kerosene]] everywhere and set her house on fire to cover their escape.  During the car ride afterward Dr. Shearing tells Aaron that they used a virus to lock in his physical modifications, eliminating his need for chems.  Cross still needs chems for the mental enhancements but there are none available.  They agree on a plan to fly to the Philippines to obtain live virus to lock in his mental enhancements as well.\n\nCross and Dr. Shearing arrive in [[Manila]] and bluff their way into the factory.  Dr. Shearing injects Cross with the live virus. Byer, having discovered Cross's trick, alerts security, but they escape the factory with Cross knocking the security supervisor unconscious and stealing his luxury wristwatch. Cross gets very ill, forcing Dr. Shearing to rent a nearby room for them to hide in.  Byer orders an agent from the new program LARX to go to Manila and track them down.  The next morning, police find where Cross and Dr. Shearing are and surround them.  Dr. Shearing screams a warning to Cross, who escapes across the rooftops.  After a lengthy chase through the streets of Manila, they lose the police and kill the LARX agent.  Cross is shot in the battle and Dr. Shearing bribes a Filipino boatman to help them escape by giving him the luxury wristwatch that Cross had previously stolen. Byer and his team, who lost track of them, search the room in which they stayed and find a message written by Cross, with his [[dog tags]] hanging on the side.\n\nBack in New York, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Jason Bourne, and that [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy committed treason by assisting Bourne and releasing top secret Treadstone files to the press. Meanwhile Shearing and Cross escape as passengers in the Filipino boatman's vessel, with the latter recovering from his wounds. They use maps to decide where they should go next.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Private First Class|PFC]] Kenneth James Kitsom / Aaron Cross, agent Number Five of Operation Outcome.

The latter eventually saw release as ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' in 2016. As of 2017, a second Renner film was considered unlikely, though such a work had been in pre-production stages since 2013. The shifting course of these projects has been somewhat complex.\n\nIn September 2012, [[Universal Pictures]] had stated at a media conference in Los Angeles that they were likely to release more Bourne films, despite ''Legacy'' being given mixed reviews by critics.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19597043 |title=''Bourne Legacy'' sequel confirmed |work=BBC News |date=September 14, 2012 |access-date=August 18, 2013}}</ref> In a December 2012 interview, [[Matt Damon]] revealed that he and [[Paul Greengrass]] were interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=780494&ocid=rr-mov-news |title=Matt Damon: Door is still open for more ''Bourne'' |work=MSN |date=December 16, 2012 |access-date=August 18, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017070147/http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=780494&ocid=rr-mov-news |archive-date=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDamon is reported saying that although he had not seen ''Legacy'', he intends to do so because not only is he curious to see it, but also because he has enjoyed Jeremy Renner in everything he has seen him in.
