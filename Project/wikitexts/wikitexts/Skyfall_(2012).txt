The film is the third to star [[Daniel Craig]] as fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]] and features [[Javier Bardem]] as [[Raoul Silva]], the [[List of James Bond villains|villain]], with [[Judi Dench]] returning as [[M (James Bond)|M]]. Directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], the film has Bond investigating a series of targeted data leaks and co-ordinated attacks on MI6 led by Raoul Silva. It sees the return of two recurring characters, [[Miss Moneypenny]] (played by [[Naomie Harris]]) and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] (played by [[Ben Whishaw]]), after an absence of two films. [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe]] and [[Albert Finney]] are among the supporting cast.\n\nMendes was approached to direct after the release of ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' in 2008. Development of the film was suspended throughout 2010 after [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures]] (MGM) filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], which caused screenwriter [[Peter Morgan]] to leave the project. Production resumed in December 2010 after Purvis, Wade, and Logan were hired and a November 2012 release date was announced in January 2011.<ref name=\"sonypr\">{{cite press release |title=Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce 7th November is Start of Production for 23rd James Bond Film 'Skyfall' |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2011/11_11/110311_bond.html |publisher=[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] |access-date = 8 January 2013|date = 3 November 2011|archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120202004136/http://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2011/11_11/110311_bond.html}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began that November after the film's title was revealed and lasted until March 2012, with filming locations including [[London]], [[Shanghai]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Scotland]].\n\n''Skyfall'' premiered at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 23 October 2012, and was released theatrically in conventional and [[IMAX Corporation|IMAX]] formats in the United Kingdom three days later and in the United States on 9 November, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first ''James Bond'' film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962). ''Skyfall'' received praise for Mendes's direction, cast performances, action sequences, cinematography, and musical score. The film was nominated for five awards at the [[85th Academy Awards]], winning two, and received [[List of accolades received by Skyfall|numerous other accolades]]. ''Skyfall'' grossed $1&nbsp;billion worldwide, the fourteenth film to do so, and became the then-[[List of highest-grossing films|seventh-highest grossing film of all time]],<!-- Please do not change: When it was released it was ranked 7th, thus the tense used; we are not a box-office tracker. --> the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, the [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest grossing film of 2012]], and the then-highest grossing film released by Sony or MGM. \n\nThe next film in the series, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film plots should be set between 400-700 words, so please see WP:FILMPLOT for more info.

She is unnamed for most of the film.-->[[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]]<!--See talk page archives.--> pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, [[M (James Bond)|M]] orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.\n\nThree months later, due to a [[public inquiry]] into M's handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the [[Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament]] and a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] officer. Although she claims she is still useful, MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the [[SIS Building|MI6 building]] explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], MI6's new [[quartermaster]], who gives him a [[radio beacon]] and a [[Walther PPK]] pistol.\n\nIn [[Shanghai]], Bond follows Patrice but is unable to prevent him killing a target. The two fight and Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Moneypenny joins Bond in his investigation on orders from Mallory. Bond finds a [[casino token]] Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, leading him to a casino in [[Macau]]. There, Bond is approached by [[S\u00e9v\u00e9rine]], Patrice's accomplice. Recognising her tattoo, he concludes she was a sex slave \"rescued\" by a criminal who now employs her, a man Bond wishes to meet. She warns him he is targeted by her bodyguards, but promises to help if Bond kills her employer. Bond thwarts the attack and joins S\u00e9v\u00e9rine on her yacht, the ''Chimera''. They travel to an abandoned island off the coast of Macau, where the crew captures and delivers them to S\u00e9v\u00e9rine's employer, [[Raoul Silva]]. Once an MI6 agent, Silva turned to [[cyberterrorism]] and orchestrated the attack on MI6. Silva kills S\u00e9v\u00e9rine, but Bond alerts MI6 reinforcements who capture Silva for [[Rendition (law)|rendition]] to Britain.\n\nAt MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, allowing Silva to escape. Q concludes Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M, whom he hates for [[Burn notice (document)|disavowing]] and betraying him to the [[Chinese government]] in 1997, leaving him to be tortured and disfigured by a suicide attempt by cyanide pill. Silva escapes his cell and Bond chases him through the [[London Underground]] and thwarts Silva's attack at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] inquiry where M is present.\n\nInstructing Q and [[Bill Tanner]] to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his [[Aston Martin DB5]] to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the [[Scottish Highlands]]. They meet Skyfall's [[gamekeeper]] Kincade, and together the trio set up a series of [[booby trap]]s throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a [[priest hole]] to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.\n\nSilva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.\n\nFollowing M's funeral, Moneypenny formally introduces herself to Bond and tells him she is retiring from fieldwork to become secretary for Mallory, the newly appointed M. Bond meets with Mallory, and tells him he is ready to get back to work.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- This order is based on the end of film credits: please do not change it -->\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond]], agent 007\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6 and Bond's superior\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as [[Raoul Silva]] (born Tiago Rodriguez),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_23_apr07_javier_bardem_tv_interview.php3?s=bond23&id=03132 |title=Javier Bardem Speaks |publisher=Mi6-hq.com |date=7 April 2012 |access-date=7 April 2012 |archive-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053409/http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/bond_23_apr07_javier_bardem_tv_interview.php3?s=bond23&id=03132 |url-status=live}}</ref> an ex-MI6 operative-turned-[[cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Gareth Mallory, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and a former SAS Lieutenant Colonel (and later the new M)\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]], an MI6 field agent\n* [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe]] as [[S\u00e9v\u00e9rine]], Raoul Silva's associate and mistress\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Kincade, the gamekeeper of the Skyfall estate<!--Please do not add that this was Finney's last film as it's better mentioned in his own article and unimportant to this article.-->\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], the MI6 [[quartermaster]]\n* [[Rory Kinnear]] as [[Bill Tanner]], the MI6 Chief of Staff\n* [[Ola Rapace]] as Patrice, a mercenary under Silva's command\n* [[Helen McCrory]] as Clair Dowar MP\n<!-- Please do not add cast members who only appear in bit parts unless appearances are significant to plot or production. -->\n{{clear}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDevelopment of ''Bond 23'' began in 2009 but was suspended throughout 2010 because of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#Attempted sale and bankruptcy protection|MGM's financial troubles]].{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=617}} Preproduction resumed following [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010, and in January 2011, the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011.
