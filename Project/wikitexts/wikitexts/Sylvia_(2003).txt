It tells a story based on the real-life romance between prominent poets [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[Ted Hughes]]. The film begins with their meeting at [[Cambridge]] in 1956 and ends with Sylvia Plath's [[suicide]] in 1963.\n\n==Plot==\nBorn in [[Boston]], Massachusetts in 1932, Plath developed a precocious talent as a writer, publishing her first poem when she was only eight years old. That same year, tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950, she began studying at [[Smith College]] on a literary scholarship, and while she was an outstanding student, she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression. Following her junior year, she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived, and, in 1955, she was granted a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to study in [[England]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nThe film begins with a shot of Plath sleeping, then opening her eyes. As a student at Cambridge she rides along on her red bicycle and wearing an academic gown. She hears of a party to celebrate the publishing of a magazine called St. Botolph's, where she meets the young poet [[Ted Hughes]]. The two fall in love and marry in 1956, then go off to Massachusetts where her mother [[Aurelia Plath|Aurelia]] lives. While they are both teaching at Smith College, Sylvia quickly learns that others are also enthralled by her husband, due to his combination of good looks, charisma, fame and success. They return to England, first to London and then to Devon, where Sylvia raises their two children and lives in her husband's professional shadow as she tries to eke out her own writing career, which doesn't come as naturally to her as it does to Ted. After a visit by David and Assia Wevill, who had rented their London flat, Sylvia rightly accuses Ted of infidelity. She kicks him out and then begins to write the poems that would be published posthumously in her collection titled Ariel. Sylvia then moves back to London with her children. Ted visits at Christmas and they make love again but he says he cannot leave Assia, who is pregnant. Shortly thereafter she prepares for her suicide, sealing off the children's room from the gas from her gas oven. A nurse comes to take out the children and Ted sees Plath's manuscript on her desk. A closing title informs us that her book made her much beloved and that Ted wrote his response in 1998 (just before his death), in a collection titled ''Birthday Letters''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as [[Sylvia Plath]]\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Ted Hughes]]\n* [[David Birkin]] as Morecambe\n* [[Alison Bruce]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Amira Casar]] as [[Assia Wevill]]\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as [[Aurelia Plath]]\n* [[Lucy Davenport]] as Doreen\n* [[Julian Firth]] as James Michie\n* Jeremy Fowlds as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Teacher Thomas\n* Sarah Guyler as Ted's Cambridge Girlfriend\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Al Alvarez]]\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as David Wevill\n* [[Liddy Holloway]] as Martha Bergstrom\n\n==Production==\n[[Frieda Hughes]], Sylvia Plath's daughter, objected to the making of the film and denied [[BBC Film|BBC Films]] the rights to her mother's poetry.

Scott]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', also praised Paltrow's portrayal of Plath, but wrote that, \"The psychological dynamics of the marriage, unsettled by professional envy and sexual jealousy, are duly noted, but the film's emotions are too big, too untidy and too strange to be contained by its story.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scott |first1=A.O. |date=17 October 2003 |title=FILM REVIEW; A Poet's Death, A Death's Poetry |work=The New York Times |agency=The New York Times Company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/movies/film-review-a-poet-s-death-a-death-s-poetry.html |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Claudia Puig]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' also praised the performances, but said the film falls short of \"depicting Plath as an artist.
