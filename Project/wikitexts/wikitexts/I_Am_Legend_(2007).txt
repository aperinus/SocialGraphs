Directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] from a screenplay by [[Akiva Goldsman]] and [[Mark Protosevich]], the film stars [[Will Smith]] as [[United States Army|US Army]] [[virology|virologist]] Robert Neville. It is set in [[New York City]] after a virus, which was originally created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal mutants. Neville is immune to the virus, and he works to develop a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants. It is the third feature-film adaptation of Matheson's novel following 1964's ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' and 1971's ''[[The Omega Man]]''.\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] began developing ''I Am Legend'' in 1994 and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene<ref name=\"Reuters\" /><ref name=\"Steuer\">{{cite web | date=April 24, 2007 |first=Joseph |last=Steuer | title=A 'Legend' in the Making | magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204523/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 |archive-date = October 11, 2007 | access-date=March 23, 2020 }}</ref> at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].\n\n''I Am Legend'' was released on December 14, 2007, in the United States and Canada. It opened to the largest-ever box office (not adjusted for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. in December and was the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2007]], earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally for a total of $585 million. The film received generally positive reviews, with Smith's performance being singled out for praise, while criticism focused on its divergences from the novel, particularly the ending. In 2022, a sequel was revealed to be in development, with Smith set to reprise his role as Neville and co-produce the film with [[Michael B. Jordan]], who will also have a starring role.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Leave real-world perspective in place per MoS (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)#Real-world perspective); Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words.

Neville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any survivors who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the [[South Street Seaport]]. Flashbacks reveal his wife, Zoe, and daughter, Marley, died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan as the military was enforcing a [[quarantine]] of the island. Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. Neville's only companion is his [[German Shepherd]] Samantha (Sam) and to cope with his loneliness, he regularly \"talks\" to some [[mannequins]] and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself with Sam inside his heavily fortified [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] home to hide from the Darkseekers.\n\nOne day as Neville hunts a deer, Sam pursues it into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and locates the deer's corpse along with Sam, but discovers the building is infested with Darkseekers. Both escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight.<!--all edits to trap section need to be [[WP:SYNTH]] free. Please do not speculate on who set the second trap and motives of the infected-->\nNeville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a [[snare trap]] and captures a female Darkseeker. A male Darkseeker attempts to pursue them but is halted by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female seemingly without success.\n\nThe next day, Neville notices \"Fred\", a mannequin usually at the local video store, positioned outside [[Grand Central Terminal]] and shoots him in confusion. However, Neville realizes he is being watched by the Darkseekers from within nearby buildings. As he approaches Fred's body, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female and is rendered unconscious after hitting his head. By the time he wakes up the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam eliminate them, but Sam is bitten during the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death as she begins to turn. Heartbroken and driven by rage, Neville ventures out and deliberately attacks a group of Darkseekers the following night, before he is rescued by a pair of immune humans, Anna and a young boy named Ethan, who have traveled from [[Maryland]] after hearing his broadcast.\n\nThey transport the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains they survived the outbreak aboard a [[Red Cross]] evacuation ship from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and are making their way to a survivors' camp in [[Bethel, Vermont]]. Neville argues no such survivors' camp exists. As he continues working to cure the female Darkseeker, Neville theorizes by lowering her body temperature with ice, he can increase the treatment's potency. The next night, a group of Darkseekers, who tracked Anna and Neville the night before, invade the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory sealing themselves in with the female test subject. Discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured, and gives it to Anna, before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade, saving the cure.\n\nThe following day, Anna and Ethan arrive at the survivors' camp in Bethel, where they are greeted by military officers and other survivors before Anna hands them the cure. Anna narrates how Neville's efforts and sacrifices to save humanity ultimately became legend.\n<!-- NOTE: The alternative ending is covered in its own section. Please do not replace the original ending here with the alternative ending. Thanks! -->\n\n===Alternate ending===\nThe two-disc special edition DVD, released in 2008, contains an alternate ending which more closely follows the novel.<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n\nDuring the lab attack, the alpha male Darkseeker creates a butterfly shape while attempting to break through the glass to the laboratory. Neville realizes it is referencing the butterfly-shaped tattoo on the female Darkseeker's neck and the alpha male is trying to recover his mate. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down and Neville apologizes after seeing the latter emotionally break down upon his mate's return. Although the alpha male initially contemplates killing Neville, he forgives his former adversary and departs with the rest of the pack. Once they are gone, a shocked Neville looks over at the many photographs of his test subjects and realizes he has become a monster in the eyes of the infected, showing remorse for the experiments he has undertaken over the years.\n\nThe next morning, Neville abandons his research and heads along with Anna and Ethan to Vermont as a changed man, in the hope of finding the survivors' colony. They cross the [[George Washington Bridge]], while Anna delivers a hopeful monologue ending with the statement: \"You are not alone.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Reyes |first=Mike |title=I Am Legend's Alternate Ending Wrapped Things Up Way Better Than What We Got |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493690/i-am-legends-alternate-ending-wrapped-things-up-way-better-than-what-we-got |website=Cinema Blend |date=April 2020 |access-date=May 18, 2020 |archive-date=April 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403015031/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493690/i-am-legends-alternate-ending-wrapped-things-up-way-better-than-what-we-got |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Derisz |first=Ricky |title=I Am Legend Ending Explained |url=https://www.looper.com/100741/legend-ending-explained/ |website=Looper |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=May 18, 2020 |archive-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224110329/https://www.looper.com/100741/legend-ending-explained/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Michael |title=I Am Legend's Alternate Ending Explained: What Happens & Why It Was Cut |url=https://screenrant.com/i-am-legend-movie-alternate-ending-changes-explained/ |website=Screen Rant |date=December 8, 2019 |access-date=May 18, 2020 |archive-date=December 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209132245/https://screenrant.com/i-am-legend-movie-alternate-ending-changes-explained/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4949|title=I am Legend (Comparison: Theatrical Cut - Alternative Theatrical Cut) - Movie-Censorship.com|first=Gerald|last=Wurm|website=www.movie-censorship.com|access-date=October 22, 2017|archive-date=May 6, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506013334/http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4949|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/OJBf94enIaU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130606203950/http://www.youtube.com:80/watch?v=OJBf94enIaU Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJBf94enIaU| title = I Am Legend the Other Ending | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Dr. Robert Neville: A former U.S. Army virologist before the worldwide plague, he loses his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash shortly after Manhattan is quarantined, and spends the next three years trying to find a cure while defending himself against the Darkseekers.
