It was filmed at [[Mosfilm]] in 1976 and released in 1977. The film's plot is based on the stageplay ''Co-workers'' (''{{lang|ru|\u0421\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0446\u044b}}'') written by Eldar Ryazanov and [[Emil Braginsky]], and tells the story of Ludmila Kalugina, head of a statistical bureau, and her subordinate, economist Anatoly Novoseltsev, who come from mutual aversion to love.\n\n''Office Romance'' was a box office success, the leader of [[List of Soviet movies of the year by ticket sales|Soviet film distribution]] in 1978 and still enjoys wide popularity in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]].\n\nBoth [[romantic drama]] and [[screwball comedy]], the film is noted for its scenes of Moscow in the late 1970s, and for its comical depiction of the everyday life and customs of Soviet society during the [[Era of Stagnation]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place in Moscow in 1976. Anatoly Yefremovich Novoseltsev, a clumsy but goodhearted single father of two sons, works at a statistical bureau under the leadership of an industrious and strict single woman in her late 30s, Ludmila Prokofievna Kalugina, nicknamed \"our [[wiktionary:en:frump|frump]]\" ({{lang|ru|\u043d\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u043c\u044b\u043c\u0440\u0430}}, also translated \"our [[hag]]\") by her subordinates. He vies for a promotion and a pay raise, but is too timid to bring up this discussion. He is nevertheless encouraged by his good friend, former classmate and colleague Olga \"Olya\" Ryzhova, a married woman who lives in the suburbs, whose husband is recuperating from a major operation in [[Yessentuki]] and whose teenage son is an athlete. Another former classmate and old friend of his, Yuri \"Yura\" Grigorievich Samokhvalov, recently assigned back to Moscow from Switzerland, nominates his old friend as a head of the light industry department to Kalugina, but the nomination is rejected. Novoseltsev, heeding Samokhvalov's advice, nervously tries to flirt with \"the Frump\" at a party in Samokhvalov's apartment, but Kalugina is further repelled by his poor attempts to impress her. Eventually drunk, Novoseltsev becomes irritated and tells Kalugina that he considers her \"dry, inhuman and heartless\".\n\nThe following morning, Novoseltsev seeks Kalugina to apologize, but inadvertently drives her to tears. Kalugina reveals that she is aware of her reputation among the surbodinates that is reflected in his remarks from the night before. They have a heart-to-heart conversation, start getting closer and soon grow fond of each other. Kalugina gradually lets down the armor of a hardened woman and puts more efforts in improving her overall appearance which surprises her colleagues.\n\nThe relationship between Anatoly and Ludmila evolves, full of comical situations and repartees. At the same time drama unfolds between Olga Ryzhova and Yuri Samokhvalov who dated many years ago at the university. Despite both being married, Olga's romantic feelings are rekindled by Samokhvalov's recent arrival at the office. He, however, treats her just as an old friend and colleague. Olga begins to write him love letters, which she passes to him through Vera \"Verochka\", the Frump's secretary, an efficient information gatherer and a huge gossip, who eventually reads the letters and leaks the affairs to the entire office. Samokhvalov, weary of the letters, relays the situation to the meddlesome Shura, the bureau's labor union committee activist, an accountant and the office's [[busybody]]. The letters, which he gives to Shura and asks her to \"sort out the problem\" at the committee, are then confiscated by Kalugina, who reprimands Samokhvalov for his tactlessness and demands that the matter is handled privately between him and Ryzhova. Later, Ryzhova, broken-hearted and humiliated, asks Samokhvalov to return the letters to her and returns to her work and life routine.\n\nOnce learns about Samokhvalov's heartless handling of Ryzhova's indiscretion, Novoseltsev angrily confronts him and later Shura for her gossip tendency. Samokhvalov retaliates by disclosing Novoseltsev's initial \"plan\" to Kalugina. She is shocked and thinks he is just another man deserting her like her last lover. She summons him to her office, appoints him as head of the light industry department and announces her intention to end their relationship while sarcastically praises his plan to achieve the promotion. Ashamed, Novoseltsev admits that while he initially pursued her with ulterior motives, has grown to appreciate her as an excellent leader and love her, to which Kalugina refutes. Frustrated, Novoseltsev rejects the promotion and tenders his resignation, which Kalugina continuously denies to spite him. This situation climaxes into a fiery spat that turns into a loud scuffle right in the office as a furious Ludmila chases Novoseltsev out of the building. They jump on a back seat of her service car and as Novoseltsev manages to comfort Ludmila, and they are seen embracing. A subtitle suggests that in 9 months there will be three boys in Novoseltsev's family, implying another son for the couple.\n\n==Casting and production==\n*Alisa Freindlich was the film director's primary choice for the role of Kalugina. Eldar Ryazanov created the character with Freindlich in mind. Moreover, he started working on the screenplay seriously only after securing consent of all the actors he wanted to cast to participate in the film. It was a rare case in Soviet cinema when a director would be allowed to cast all actors of his own choice without preliminary screen-tests and approval of the Art Council.<ref name=\"mk1\"/><ref name=\"elryaz\">{{cite news|title=\"Eldar Ryazanov about his collaboration with Alisa Freindlich and making of \"Office Romance\"\"|url=http://eldar-ryazanov.ru/index.php?r=11&m=62&p=20|access-date=2008-01-17|language=ru|publisher=eldar-ryazanov.ru}}</ref> Ryazanov worried that Freindlich would not be able to come to Moscow for shooting of the film because of stage performances and rehearsals she was busy with in her native Leningrad. So he assured both the actress and her management that she would be allowed to go to Leningrad on the first demand. It came out that she was compelled to leave for the theater often, and thus traveled between Moscow and Leningrad all the time.<ref name=\"mk1\">{{cite news|title=\"Office Romance\"- the novel about love and friendship|date=2007-11-26|url=http://www.mk.ru/blogs/MK/2007/10/26/cinema/320320/|access-date=2008-01-17|language=ru|work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]}}</ref>\n*In order to create a genuine image of a frumpy boss, Ryazanov and Freindlich searched through all the wardrobes of the studio for baggy, old-fashioned clothes. Cameraman Vladimir Nakhabtsev brought to the studio the old thick-frammed glasses that belonged to his father - they helped to complete the image.<ref name=\"mk1\"/><ref name=\"mk2\"/>\n*Ryazanov took some risk casting Andrey Myagkov for the second time for the role of a clumsy intellectual, similar to this in 1975 hit ''[[The Irony of Fate]]''. Not everyone agreed with the director's decision upon casting. Oleg Basilashvili didn't like the role of the \"villain\" Samokhvalov. Like Freindlich, he had to travel frequently between Moscow and Leningrad due to obligations on the Leningrad stage, and he believed that his worn-out look would be ideal to portray an unkempt and humble Novoseltsev. Later, during the shooting he admitted that the director's choice was right. But it was a hard task for make-up artists to make a glossy complacent Samokhvalov out of the exhausted Basilashvili, and, on the contrary, a sloppy bachelor Novoseltsev out of the refined Myagkov.<ref name=\"mk1\"/><ref name=\"elryaz\"/><ref name=\"mk2\">{{cite news|title=The 30 year long \"Office Romance\"|date=2007-11-29|url=http://www.mk.ru/blogs/idmk/2007/10/29/Bulvar/320028/|access-date=2008-01-17|language=ru|work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]}}</ref>\n*One of few roles for which screen-tests were taken was the role of the activist Shura. Actress Ludmila Ivanova, who in real life was head of a local labor union committee at the [[Sovremennik Theatre]], got into the role quickly and was the most convincing when she shouted out: \"Comrades, donate 50 copecks!\"\n\n==Audience reaction, critical reception and awards==\n''Office Romance'' was a Soviet hit movie in 1978 having 58.4 million viewers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Office Romance at KinoExpert.ru|publisher=KinoExpert.ru|url=http://www.kinoexpert.ru/index.asp?comm=4&num=306#1|access-date=2007-12-25|language=ru}}</ref> and still remains one of the most popular Soviet-era films in Russia and other former Soviet republics. [[Alisa Freindlich]] and Andrey Myagkov were named Best Actors of the year by readers of ''[[Soviet Screen]]'' magazine.\n\nThe film received general approval from critics; there was not one negative review of the film. High artistical level, skills and organic collaboration of director and actors were noted, as well as vivid portrayal of Moscow, comic elements in parallel with investigation of moral issues.\n\nMembers of the State Art Council nominated the leading actors for the [[USSR State Prize]]. Alisa Freindlich was the only lead one who didn't receive the Prize - according to the rules of that time, an actor couldn't be given a new prize within two years of getting a previous one, and Freindlich had already been awarded for her stage performance a year before the release of the film.<ref name=\"mk1\"/><ref name=\"mk2\"/>\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of the film's release, Google released a [[Google Doodle]] in its honor for Russia and Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |title=104th Anniversary of Film \"Office Romance\" |url=http://www.google.com/doodles/104th-anniversary-of-film-office-romance |date=October 26, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20171025233316/http://www.google.com/doodles/104th-anniversary-of-film-office-romance |archive-date=October 25, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Google \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0434\u0443\u0434\u043b \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u044f \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \"\u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\" |url=http://www.aif.ru/society/web/google_sozdal_dudl_v_chest_yubileya_filma_sluzhebnyy_roman |publisher=aif |date=October 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20171025233631/http://www.aif.ru/society/web/google_sozdal_dudl_v_chest_yubileya_filma_sluzhebnyy_roman |archive-date=October 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 a remake was released, titled ''[[Office Romance.
