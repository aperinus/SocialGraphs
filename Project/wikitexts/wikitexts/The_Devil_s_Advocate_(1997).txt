Based on [[Andrew Neiderman]]'s 1990 novel of the same name, it is about a gifted young Florida lawyer (Reeves) invited to New York City to work for a major firm. As his wife (Theron) becomes haunted by frightening visions, the lawyer slowly begins to realize the owner of the firm (Pacino) is not what he appears to be, and is in fact the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]].\n\nPacino's character, [[Satan]], takes the guise of a human lawyer named after the author of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', [[John Milton]]. The story and direction contain allusions to Milton's epic, [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', and the legend of [[Faust]]. An adaptation of Neiderman's novel went into a [[development hell]] during the 1990s, with Hackford gaining control of the production. Filming took place around New York City and Florida.\n\n''The Devil's Advocate'' received mixed reviews, with critics crediting it for entertainment value and Pacino's performance. It grossed over $153&nbsp;million in the box office and won the [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film]]. It also became the subject of the copyright lawsuit ''[[#Hart v. Warner Bros., Inc.|Hart v. Warner Bros., Inc.]]'' for its visual art.\n\n==Plot==\nKevin Lomax is a [[Gainesville, Florida]] defense attorney who has never lost a case. As he defends schoolteacher Lloyd Gettys against a charge of [[child molestation]], he belatedly realizes his client is guilty. However, through a harsh [[cross-examination]], Kevin destroys the victim's credibility, securing a \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nA representative of a New York City law firm asks Kevin to assist a [[jury selection]]. After the jury delivers a not guilty verdict, the head of the firm, John Milton, offers Kevin a high-paying job. Kevin accepts, and he and his wife Mary Ann move to [[Manhattan]]. He is soon spending most of his time at work, leaving Mary Ann feeling isolated. Kevin's [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] mother, Alice, visits New York City and suggests they both return home after an unsettling conversation with Milton, but Kevin refuses.\n\nWhen billionaire Alex Cullen is accused of murdering his wife, his stepson, and a maid, Milton assigns the case to Kevin. This demands more of Kevin's time, further separating him from Mary Ann, and he begins to fantasize about his co-worker, Christabella. Mary Ann begins seeing visions of the partners' wives becoming [[demon]]ic, and has a nightmare about a baby playing with her removed [[ovaries]]. Mary Ann reveals to Kevin that a doctor has declared her infertile, and begs Kevin to return them to Gainesville, but he refuses. Milton suggests Kevin step down from the trial to tend to his wife, but Kevin says that he fears he will resent her for costing him the case.\n\nEddie Barzoon, the firm's [[managing partner]], is convinced that Kevin is competing for his job when he discovers Kevin's name on the firm's charter. Surprised, Kevin denies any knowledge of this and Eddie threatens to inform the [[United States Attorney]]'s office of the firm's activities. Kevin tells Milton about Eddie's threats, but Milton seems to dismiss them; during the conversation, Eddie is beaten to death in Central Park by vagrants with demonic appearances. A [[U.S. Justice Department]] agent investigating Milton warns Kevin that his boss is corrupt, and also reveals that Gettys has been arrested for killing a little girl. Moments later, the agent is struck by a car and killed.\n\nWhile preparing Melissa Black, Cullen's secretary, to testify about Cullen's [[alibi]], Kevin realizes she is lying and tells Milton he believes Cullen is guilty. Milton offers to back him regardless and Kevin proceeds, winning an acquittal with Black's [[perjury|perjured]] testimony. Afterwards, Kevin finds Mary Ann covered with a blanket in a nearby church. She claims Milton raped and brutalized her that day, but Kevin says it is impossible, as he was with Milton in court. Mary Ann drops her blanket, revealing her naked body covered with cuts and scratches. Assuming she injured herself, Kevin commits her to a mental institution.\n\nAlice, Kevin, and Pam Garrety, his case manager, visit Mary Ann at the institution. After seeing Pam as a demon, Mary Ann hits her with a hand mirror and barricades the room. As Kevin breaks down the door, Mary Ann commits suicide by cutting her throat with a shard of glass. Alice reveals that Milton is Kevin's father, whom she met in New York decades earlier, and her experience with him was traumatic. Kevin leaves the hospital to confront Milton, who admits to raping Mary Ann. Kevin shoots Milton, but the bullets pass through him. Milton reveals himself as [[Satan]], and Kevin blames him for everything that happened. Milton counters that he merely \"set the stage\", and that Kevin could have left at any time. Kevin realizes he always wanted to win, no matter the cost. Christabella emerges from the shadows, and Milton tells Kevin that he wants Kevin and Christabella - whom he reveals to be Kevin's half-sister - to conceive the [[Antichrist]]. Kevin initially appears to acquiesce, but then abruptly shoots himself in the head. Milton's Satanic rage turns the room into a furnace, burning Christabella alive, initially revealing his demonic form before turning into a white angel who resembles Kevin.\n\nSuddenly, Kevin finds himself back at the recess of the Gettys trial. He announces that he cannot represent his client despite the threat of [[disbarment]]. Kevin's reporter friend Larry offers him a high-profile interview, promising to make him famous. Encouraged by Mary Ann, Kevin agrees. After they leave, Larry transforms into Milton, who says to the film's viewers, \"Vanity--definitely my favorite sin.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Charlize Theron]] star.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = KeanuReevesLakehouse.jpg\n | width1    = 125\n | alt1      =\n | image2    = CharlizeTheronFeb08.jpg\n | width2    = 148\n | alt2      =\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Kevin Lomax\n* [[Al Pacino]] as John Milton /  [[Satan#In film and television|Satan]]\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Mary Ann Lomax\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Eddie Barzoon\n* [[Judith Ivey]] as Alice Lomax\n* [[Connie Nielsen]] as Christabella Andreoli\n* [[Craig T.

Brown judges the climax, in which Milton attempts to persuade Lomax to have sex with his half-sister to conceive the [[Antichrist]], to be the most \"Miltonic\", as the sculptures become animated in carnal activities evoking ''Paradise Lost''{{'}}s \"Downfall of the Rebel Angels\".{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=93}} The tirade Milton gives in this sequence is at times also reminiscent of Satan's lines in ''Paradise Lost'' Books I and II.{{sfn|Netzley|2006|p=116}} In U.S. literary education, Milton's temptation of Lomax in the climax, in which he rationalizes rebellion against God for a \"Look, but don't touch\" model, has been compared to Satan urging [[Eve]] to eat [[forbidden fruit]] in ''Paradise Lost'', Book IX, lines 720\u2013730:{{sfn|Webb|2007|p=126}}\n\n{{Blockquote|If they all things, who enclos'd Knowledge of good and evil in this tree, That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?}}\n\nIn his DVD commentary, Taylor Hackford did not name ''Paradise Lost'' as an inspiration, instead citing the legend of [[Faust]].{{sfn|Netzley|2006|p=115}} An underlying concept of the story is a \"[[Faustian bargain]]\", offered to a character with [[free will]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|pp=91\u201392}} Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] writes Milton referring to free will as a \"bitch\", when Lomax contemplates selling his soul, moves away from a legalistic definition of \"free will\" as \"uncoerced\", into the philosophical realm of its definition.{{sfn|van Inwagen|2017|p=151}}\n\nAs with ''[[Goethe's Faust]]'', the Devil commonly depicted in cinema is associated with lust and temptation.{{sfn|Wyman|2009|p=303}}  Milton shows Lomax many seductive women, in order to induce his \"fall\". Sex or rape is usually also the means by which Satan creates the Antichrist, as in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. In ''The Devil's Advocate'', someone other than Satan will have sex to conceive the Antichrist, though Milton nevertheless brutally rapes Mary Ann.{{sfn|Wyman|2009|p=303}} [[Incest in film and television|Incest]] becomes a way of creating the Antichrist, since the offspring of Satan's son and daughter will inherit much of Satan's genetic makeup.{{sfn|Fry|2008|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n[[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' raised \"visual potential\" that informed the film.{{sfn|Iannucci|2004|p=x}} Dantean scholar Amilcare A. Iannucci argues the plot follows the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' model in beginning with ''selva oscura'', in Lomax losing his conscience defending a guilty man, and then entering and exploring deeper circles of Hell.{{sfn|Iannucci|2004|p=13}} Iannucci compares the office building structure to the circles, listing fireplaces where flames are always present; demonic visual phenomena; and water outside Milton's office, analogized to [[Dante's Satan]]'s icy home, albeit situated at the top of Hell as opposed to the bottom.{{sfn|Iannucci|2004|pp=13\u201314}} Free will is also a major theme in the ''Divine Comedy'', with the film's musings on the concept being similar to Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'', 16.82\u201383 (\"if the present world has gone astray, in you is the cause, in you it's to be sought\").{{sfn|Iannucci|2004|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nOther religious references are present. In describing New York City as [[Babylon]], Alice Lomax invokes [[Revelation 18]]:{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=92}}\n\n{{Blockquote|Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird!}}\n\nMilton tempting Lomax is possibly also inspired by the Biblical [[Temptation of Christ]].{{sfn|Fry|2008|pp=116\u2013117}} Aside from Milton, other character names have been commented on: Author Kelly J. Wyman matches Mary Ann, the virginal figure who falls victim to Milton, to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], and adds the literal translation of Christabella is \"Beautiful Christ\",{{sfn|Wyman|2009|p=307}} and that the title refers to the Catholic Church's [[Devil's advocate]]s and lawyers as advocates;{{sfn|Wyman|2009|pp=307\u2013308}} Eric C. Brown finds Barzoon's name and character to be reminiscent of the demon prince [[Beelzebub]].{{sfn|Brown|2006|p=93}} Scholars [[Miguel A. De La Torre]] and Albert Hern\u00e1ndez observe the vision of Satan as CEO, wearing expensive clothing and engaging in business, had appeared in popular culture before, including the 1942 novel ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''.{{sfn|De La Torre|Hern\u00e1ndez|2011|p=14}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Milton diktiert seinen T\u00f6chtern das \u00bbParadise Lost\u00ab (Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s depiction of Milton dictating ''Paradise Lost''; Milton's line \"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n\" is used in the screenplay.]]\n[[Andrew Neiderman]] wrote ''The Devil's Advocate'' as a novel, and it was published in 1990 by [[Simon and Schuster]].{{sfn|Netzley|2006|p=123}} Believing his story could be adapted into a film, Neiderman approached [[Warner Bros.]] and claimed to have led his successful sale with the synopsis \"It's about a law firm in New York that represents only guilty people, and never loses\".<ref name=\"Desert\">{{cite web |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/books/2014/05/23/andrew-neiderman-vc-andrews-devils-advocate-author/9507065/ |title=Author Andrew Neiderman enjoys literary, TV success |author=TDS |work=[[The Desert Sun]] |date=May 23, 2014 |access-date=August 19, 2017 |archive-date=July 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210704015316/https://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/books/2014/05/23/andrew-neiderman-vc-andrews-devils-advocate-author/9507065/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVarious screenplay adaptations of ''The Devil's Advocate'' had been pitched to U.S. cinema studios, with [[Joel Schumacher]] planned to direct it with [[Brad Pitt]] as the young lawyer.<ref name=\"Mathews\">{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/15/entertainment/ca-42772 |title=Jumping into the Fire: In 'Advocate,' Al Pacino takes a walk on the dark side.
