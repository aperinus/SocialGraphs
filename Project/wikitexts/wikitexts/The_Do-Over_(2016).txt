He is a bank manager in a supermarket and Nikki is cheating on him with Ted-O.  Charlie reunites with his old high school buddy (and FBI agent) Max at a high school reunion. They spend a weekend on a yacht Max rented, and Charlie feels young again.\n\nMax blows up the yacht to [[faked death|fake their deaths]]. When Charlie regains consciousness, Max tells him they can now both start new, better lives. He confesses that he is not an FBI agent and is actually a [[coroner]]. This allowed him to use two unclaimed [[cadavers]] in place of them; Charlie is given the new identity of Dr. Ronald P. Fishman, and Max takes on the new identity of Butch Ryder. Initially appalled, Charlie soon realises he has no reason to return to his old life after witnessing his lackluster funeral, Nikki reconciling with Ted-O and that the bank have quickly replaced his job role. Max tells Charlie that he found a key in Butch's rectum, which Charlie as a bank manager determines it belongs to a [[safe deposit box]] in [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nTraveling to Puerto Rico, they access Butch's safe deposit box, which contains money and the keys to a mansion with a Ferrari. The duo relocate there, befriending and later having an orgy with neighbours Dawn and Joan during which Dawn reveals the original Butch and Ronald bought the mansion in a hurry, implying they were on the run from something. \nThey find out Ronald was married after seeing a picture of his wife on Butch's [[tablet computer|tablet]]. At the mansion, Max and Charlie are attacked by a group of assassins led by The Gymnast. They escape, and Max admits he's not a coroner, but actually a [[guidance counselor]].\n\nThey return to the continental U.S. to find Ronald's widow, Heather at her home in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Max and Charlie explain to her that Ronald was murdered and infer that Butch got Ronald entangled in criminal activity. Heather tells them that Ronald's study was broken into recently.\n\nThe trio head to a biker bar where Ronald and Butch used to meet up. At the bar, they learn from a biker, Dakota, that Butch had stage four cancer. Ronald had developed a \"magic bullet\" cancer treatment and they began conducting secret, non-FDA approved [[clinical trial]]s, when Ronald's financier, Shecky, withdrew funding, Butch started robbing banks.\nDakota reveals that Ronald and Butch had an affair but is then killed by The Gymnast. The trio escape to Max's mother's house where they are stalked by Max's ex, Becca, and Charlie ends up having sex with Heather.\n\nAt Shecky's he reveals that his house was also broken into recently. The trio leave, determining the men who tried to kill them and broke into their homes wanted the cancer treatment formula. Charlie says they should forfeit the formula when they find it, which angers Max. While hacking Ronald's computer, Charlie discovers Max was one of Ronald's cancer patients. He also learns that Max has a young son with Becca, and realizes Max had been trying to recover the cure to save his own life.\n\nReturning to Shecky's, Max thinks he is withholding the cure. Shecky has been shot, but before he dies, reveals the assassins were hired by Trojgaard, the world's largest [[chemotherapy]] company, to steal the cure and bury it. The Gymnast, still in the house, takes Max hostage.\n\nMeanwhile, at Becca's, Charlie realises the [[Jenga]] [[application software|app]] on Butch's tablet actually holds Ronald's cure. He attempts to call Max, but The Gymnast destroys Max's phone as he is tortured. Heather then arrives at Shecky's, telling Max that she not only accepted a fortune from Trojgaard to bury the formula when Ronald refused, but also that she was the one who killed Ronald and Butch.\n\nCharlie calls Heather, and she claims Max killed Shecky. When they meet, Charlie sees through her lie, and punches her in the face, but she then holds him at gunpoint. Before she can shoot, Max, who had escaped The Gymnast after he accidentally electrocuted himself, knocks her down. Heather then points the gun at them both, but Becca shows up, beats her unconscious, and recovers the tablet. The police arrive, and when they draw their weapons, Becca accidentally throws the tablet into the bay as she puts up her hands.\n\nThe tablet suffers irreparable damage, but Charlie backed up the formula on a [[USB flash drive|USB]]. The men are pardoned for their crimes when they offer the cancer treatment as a bargaining chip. Charlie disguises himself as a zombie and gets his revenge at Nikki, Ted-O and the twins. Charlie, Max, Becca, son and mother return to the mansion in Puerto Rico after Max is cured.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Max\n* [[David Spade]] as Charlie\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Heather\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Becca\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Bob\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as Shecky\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] as Mrs. Kessler\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Ted-O\n* [[Natasha Leggero]] as Nikki\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Jorge The Shooter Boy\n* [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Dawn DeFazio\n* Jackie Sandler as Joan\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as Carmine\n* [[Torsten Voges]] as The Gymnast\n* Stan Ellsworth as Dakota\n* [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]] as Auto Store Lou\n* [[Jackie Sandler]] as Joan\n* [[Jared Sandler]] as DJ\n* Zakk and Xander Paradise as the twins\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on July 7, 2015, and it ended on August 21, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Filming begins on new Adam Sandler film 'The Do Over'|url=http://www.wtoc.com/story/29490478/filming-begins-on-new-adam-sandler-film-the-do-over|access-date=July 8, 2015|publisher=WTOC|date=July 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Adam Sandler's 'The Do Over' begins filming in Savannah, GA next month|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2015/06/11/adam-sandlers-the-do-over-begins-filming-in-savannah-ga-next-month/|access-date=July 8, 2015|publisher=onlocationvacations.com|date=June 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released worldwide on [[Netflix]] on May 27, 2016.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 3.17/10.
