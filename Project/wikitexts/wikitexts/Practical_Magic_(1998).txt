The film was directed by [[Griffin Dunne]] and stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Stockard Channing]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Aidan Quinn]], and [[Goran Visnjic|Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]].\n\nBullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, descended from a long line of witches. Raised by their aunts after their parents' death from a family curse, the sisters were taught the uses of practical magic as they grew up. As adults, Sally and Gillian must use their magic to destroy an evil spirit before it kills them.\n\nThe film is considered a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref name=\"insider.com\">{{Cite web|last=Renae|first=Kirstie|title=10 surprising things you didn't know about 'Practical Magic'|url=https://www.insider.com/cool-facts-you-never-knew-about-practical-magic|access-date=2020-08-16|website=Insider}}</ref><ref name=\"vogue.com.au\">{{Cite web|last=Eksouzian-Cavadas|first=Ana|date=2019-08-21|title=Cult '90s film Practical Magic is getting a TV reboot|url=https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/features/cult-90s-film-practical-magic-is-getting-a-tv-reboot/news-story/552948255daf47fa96403292be27dc32|access-date=2020-08-16|website=Vogue Australia|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nIn a small Massachusetts town, the Owens family have been regarded with suspicion for over three centuries due to their ancestor Maria Owens, who survived an attempted execution for witchcraft. Heartbroken when the father of her unborn child never returned to her, Maria cast a spell to prevent herself from ever falling in love again. The spell developed into a curse upon Maria's descendants, dooming any man an Owens woman loves.\n\nIn the present, Gillian and Sally Owens are taken in by their aunts Frances and Jet after both their parents succumb to the Owens curse. As children, Sally and Gillian are frequently ridiculed by the town's schoolchildren. After witnessing their aunts cast a love spell for a woman obsessed with her beloved, Sally casts a spell on herself to ensure she will only fall in love with a man who possesses certain impossible traits, with the goal that she will never fall in love. Meanwhile Gillian, witnessing the same incident, cannot wait to fall in love. When the girls are teens, Gillian [[elopement|elopes]] with her boyfriend and leaves for [[Los Angeles]]. Before Gillian departs, she and Sally make a blood spell to always be faithful to one another.\n\nGillian spends the next decade moving from relationship to relationship across the country, while back in Massachusetts, Sally meets and marries a man named Michael. The two have two young daughters, Kylie and Antonia. After Michael is fatally hit by a truck, Sally and her daughters return to live with the aunts. After the aunts reveal that they secretly cast a love spell on her so that she could marry and be happy, Sally forbids them from teaching her daughters magic.\n\nSally sinks into depression after Michael\u2019s death. Sensing her pain, Gillian astrally projects to Sally and they spend the night reconnecting. Gillian has become involved with a dangerously obsessive man named Jimmy Angelov, whom she drugs with belladonna so she can sleep. Invigorated by Gillian\u2019s visit, Sally finds strength and opens the botanical shop she had planned to with Michael. \n\nGillian calls home in distress and Sally takes off to rescue her. Upon finding her sister, Jimmy holds them both hostage in his car. At Gillian\u2019s insistence, Sally puts belladonna into Jimmy's tequila to sedate him but the dosage inadvertently kills him instead. Realising that the belladonna in Jimmy\u2019s blood would ruin a self-defence plea, the sisters take his body back to the aunts' house. They resurrect him with a forbidden spell, which causes him to return and attack Gillian. Sally kills him again, and the sisters bury his remains in the garden. The aunts are overjoyed at Gillian\u2019s return, but their late night revelries are soured by a malevolent presence they can all sense. When Sally and Gillian deny it, the aunts leave them to clean up their own mess.\n\nThe next morning, state investigator Gary Hallett arrives from [[Tucson, Arizona]] in search of Jimmy, who is also a serial killer. Sally feels drawn to him, with her daughters surmising that he is the impossible man from the childhood love spell. Sally breaks down and confesses to Gary, taking the full blame for Jimmy\u2019s death. Unable to deny their attraction, they kiss but Sally flees when she realises Gary is the man she conjured. \n\nReturning home, Sally discovers Jimmy's spirit has possessed Gillian's body. Gary sees Jimmy's spirit emerge. Jimmy tries possessing Gary, but is turned aside by his silver badge. Sally tells Gary  he is there because of her spell,  the feelings they have for each other are not real, and the family curse will kill him if they pursue a relationship. Gary replies that curses only work if one believes in them, before returning to Tucson.\n\nJimmy possesses Gillian again and tries killing Sally before Frances and Jet return. Realizing she must embrace magic to save her sister, Sally asks the aid of the townswomen and they form a coven to [[exorcism|exorcise]] Jimmy's spirit. Their first attempt hurts Gillian and Sally makes them stop. In a moment of inspiration, Sally re-enacts her blood pact with Gillian. Jimmy\u2019s spirit is expelled from Gillian and the family curse is finally broken. Jimmy is sealed into the grave. \n\nIn Tucson, Gary clears the sisters of any suspicion in Jimmy's case and returns to Massachusetts to be with Sally. By Halloween, the townsfolk have finally embraced the Owens women and gather to watch the witches fly off the roof. The film ends with Sally and Gary sharing a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Sally Owens, a witch who becomes widowed after the Owens curse kills her husband.

Because the film's producers decided the house was a big part of the depiction of the Owens culture, a house to accurately represent that vision was built on [[San Juan Island]] in the state of Washington.<ref>{{cite web|title=Practical Magic: A Victorian House Fit for a Witch|url=http://hookedonhouses.net/2009/10/25/practical-magic-a-victorian-house-fit-for-a-witch/|publisher=Hooked|access-date=31 October 2012|date=25 October 2009|quote=It looks like a real house that was built in the 1850s, but it\u2019s really just an \u201carchitectural shell\u201d that took 8 months to build and was (sadly) destroyed after filming was over.}}</ref> While much of the set from California was brought to that location and placed inside the house, it took nearly a year to perfect the image of the house and the interior.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design|url=http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|work=Practical Magic|publisher=Amas Veritas|access-date=31 October 2012|quote=Though this Victorian house looks as if it's been in place for a century, it's actually an architectural shell.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093608/http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|archive-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> The house, actually only a shell with nothing inside, was built only for this filming and was torn down after filming was completed. The small town scenes were filmed in downtown Coupeville, Washington, a Victorian-era seaside port town located on the south side of Penn Cove on [[Whidbey Island]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coupeville- The Home to \"Practical Magic\"|url=https://whidbeycamanoislands.com/coupeville-the-home-to-practical-magic/|access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Sandra Bullock in the DVD commentary, while filming the scene where the Owens women are drunk and slinging insults, the actresses actually got drunk on very bad [[tequila]] brought by Kidman. The cast further stated in the film's commentary that they felt supernatural elements of the house started to affect them. Both the cast and crew claimed they heard supernatural noises while filming the coven scene at the end of the film. For the final scene with all of the townspeople at the Owens home, the entire population of the town where filming took place was invited to show up in costume and appear as townsfolk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coupeville Celebrates 'Practical Magic'|url=https://www.king5.com/article/entertainment/television/programs/evening/coupeville-celebrates-practical-magic/281-604592879|access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Practical Magic\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = Practicalmagicalbum.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Photo by Suzanne Tenner\n| released   = October 6, 1998 (original pressing)\n| recorded   = August 15\u201316, 1998,<br />[[Abbey Road Studios]] (Michael Nyman tracks)\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Minimal music|minimalism]], [[orchestra]]l\n| length     = 56:58 (Nyman pressing); 51:46 (Silvestri pressing)\n| language   = English\n| label      = [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| producer   = Danny Bramson, [[Sandra Bullock]]\n| chronology = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| prev_title = [[Strong on Oaks, Strong on the Causes of Oaks]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Ravenous (soundtrack)|Ravenous]]\n| next_year  = 1999\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]\n | prev_year  = 1998\n | title      = Practical Magic\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\n\nComposer [[Michael Nyman]]'s score to the movie was abruptly replaced with music by [[Alan Silvestri]] for the theatrical release. This last-minute change resulted in the release of two soundtracks, although as primarily a [[compilation album]] only the two tracks of newly created material were changed. A 50-track demo (the last two tracks being \"Convening the Coven\" and \"Maria Owens\") of Nyman's score has been circulating among fans as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]. The complete Nyman score runs 62:30 and contains music that would later appear, in altered form, in ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' and ''[[The Actors]]'', as well as a bit of his stepwise chord progression theme from ''[[Out of the Ruins]]''/''[[String Quartets 1\u20133#String Quartet No. 3|String Quartet No. 3]]''/''[[Carrington (film)#Music|Carrington]]''/''[[The End of the Affair (1999 film)#Music|The End of the Affair]]''/''[[The Claim (2000 film)|The Claim]]''. \"Convening the Coven\", though not \"Maria Owens,\" was subsequently reissued on ''[[The Very Best of Michael Nyman: Film Music 1980\u20132001]]'', and music that uses material related to this piece has not been used elsewhere.  \"Convening the Coven\" became \"City of Turin\" on ''[[The Glare]]''.\n\nSinger [[Stevie Nicks]] headlined the soundtrack's published advertisements, promoting her song \"If You Ever Did Believe\" and a new recording of her song \"Crystal,\" both featuring [[Sheryl Crow]] on back-up vocals.\n\n<!-- see [[Template:Track listing]] to improve this section -->\n; Track listing\n# \"If You Ever Did Believe\" \u2013 [[Stevie Nicks]]\n# \"[[This Kiss (Faith Hill song)|This Kiss]]\" \u2013 [[Faith Hill]]\n# \"[[Got to Give It Up|Got to Give It Up (Pt.1)]]\" \u2013 [[Marvin Gaye]]\n# \"Is This Real?\" \u2013 [[Lisa Hall (musician)|Lisa Hall]]\n# \"Black Eyed Dog\" \u2013 [[Nick Drake]]\n# \"[[A Case of You (song)|A Case of You]]\" \u2013 [[Joni Mitchell]]\n# \"Nowhere and Everywhere\" \u2013 [[Michelle Lewis]]\n# \"[[Always on My Mind]]\" \u2013 [[Elvis Presley]]\n# \"Everywhere\" \u2013 [[Bran Van 3000]]\n# \"[[Coconut (song)|Coconut]]\" \u2013 [[Harry Nilsson]]\n# \"Crystal\" \u2013 Stevie Nicks\n# \"Practical Magic\" \u2013 [[Alan Silvestri]] / \"Convening the Coven\" \u2013 The Michael Nyman Orchestra\n# \"Amas Veritas\" \u2013 Alan Silvestri / \"Maria Owens\" \u2013 The Michael Nyman Orchestra\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Practical Magic'' opened at #1 with $13.1 million in ticket sales.
