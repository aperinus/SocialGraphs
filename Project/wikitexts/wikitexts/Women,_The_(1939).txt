The film is based on [[Clare Boothe Luce]]'s 1936 [[The Women (play)|play of the same name]], and was adapted for the screen by [[Anita Loos]] and [[Jane Murfin]], who had to make the film acceptable for the [[Production Code]] for it to be released.\n\nThe film stars [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Lucile Watson]], [[Mary Boland]], [[Florence Nash]], and [[Virginia Grey]]. [[Marjorie Main]] and [[Phyllis Povah]] also appear, reprising their stage roles from the play. [[Ruth Hussey]], [[Virginia Weidler]], [[Butterfly McQueen]], [[Theresa Harris]], and [[Hedda Hopper]] also appear in smaller roles. Fontaine was the last surviving actress with a credited role in the film; she died in 2013. <!-- as per check of IMDb bios for the film's actresses. -->\n\nThe film continued the play's all-female tradition\u2014the entire cast of more than 130 speaking roles was female. Set in the glamorous Manhattan apartments of high society evoked by [[Cedric Gibbons]], and in Reno, Nevada, where they obtain their divorces, it presents an acidic commentary on the pampered lives and power struggles of various rich, bored wives and other women they come into contact with.\n\nFilmed in black and white, it includes a six-minute fashion parade filmed in [[Technicolor]], featuring [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]]'s most ''outr\u00e9 ''designs; often cut in modern screenings, it has been restored by Turner Classic Movies. On DVD, the original black-and-white fashion show, which is a different take, is available for the first time.\n\nThroughout ''The Women'', not a single male character is seen or heard. The attention to detail was such that even in props such as portraits, only female figures are represented, and several animals which appeared as pets were also female. The only exceptions are a poster-drawing of a bull in the fashion show segment, a framed portrait of Stephen Haines as a boy, a figurine on Mary's night stand, and an advertisement on the back of the magazine Peggy reads at Mary's house before lunch that contains a photograph of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is a scathing look at a group of Manhattan women and the scores of women who work for them. It centers on Mary Haines, the cheerful, contented wife of Stephen and mother of Little Mary, and her circle of \"friends\". Mary's cousin Sylvia Fowler goes to Sydney's elite salon to get the latest nail color: Jungle Red. Olga, the manicurist, reveals that Mary's husband has been \"stepping out\"\u00a0 with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen. Sylvia eagerly shares the news with Mary's friends and sets Mary up with Olga.\n\nMary is shattered to learn about Stephen's infidelity. Her wise mother urges patience and takes Mary to Bermuda with her, so she can take time to think. When they return, Mary goes to a couturier for a fitting. Crystal appears, ordering expensive clothes. Stephen is now keeping her.\u00a0 At Sylvia's insistence, Mary confronts Crystal, who slyly suggests that Mary keep the status quo unless she wants to lose Stephen in a divorce. Heartbroken and humiliated, Mary leaves. The gossip continues, exacerbated by Sylvia and their friend Edith, who turns the affair into a public scandal by recounting Sylvia's version of the story to a gossip columnist. Mary decides to divorce her husband despite his efforts to make her stay. As she packs to leave for Reno, Mary explains the divorce to Little Mary, who weeps alone in the bathroom.\n\nOn the train to Reno, Mary meets three women with the same destination and purpose: the dramatic, extravagant Countess de Lave; Miriam Aarons, a tough-cookie chorus girl; and, to her surprise, her shy young friend Peggy Day, who has been pushed into divorce by Sylvia. They all settle in at a Reno ranch, where they get plenty of commonsense advice from Lucy, the gruff, warm-hearted woman who runs the ranch. The Countess tells tales of her multiple husbands and seems to have found another prospect in a cowboy named Buck Winston. Miriam has been having an affair with Sylvia Fowler's husband and plans to marry him. Peggy discovers that she is pregnant, calls her husband and happily plans to hurry home. Sylvia arrives at the ranch; Howard is suing her, thanks to recorded evidence of mental cruelty. When she discovers that Miriam is the next Mrs. Fowler, she attacks her, and a fight ensues.\n\nMary's divorce comes through, but Miriam tries to convince her that she should forget her pride and call Stephen. Before Mary can decide, Stephen calls to inform Mary that he and Crystal have just been married.\n\nTwo years later, Crystal, now Mrs. Haines, is taking a bubble bath and talking on the phone to her lover, Buck Winston, now a radio star and married to the Countess. Little Mary overhears the conversation before being shooed away by Crystal. Sylvia picks up the phone and hears the voice of Crystal's lover.\n\nMary hosts a dinner for her Reno buddies and her Manhattan friends\u2014excepting Sylvia\u2014celebrating Buck and the Countess's second anniversary. The Countess, Miriam, and Peggy urge Mary to come along to a nightclub, but she stays home. Little Mary inadvertently reveals how unhappy Stephen is and mentions Crystal's \"lovey dovey\" talk with Buck on the telephone. Mary is transformed, crying \"I've had two years to grow claws, Mother\u2014Jungle Red!\"\n\nIn the nightclub's ladies' lounge, Mary worms the details out of Sylvia, and gets the news to a gossip columnist (played by [[Hedda Hopper]]). Mary tells the Countess that her husband Buck has been having an affair with Crystal, then informs Crystal that everyone knows what she has been doing. Crystal does not care. Mary can have Stephen back, since she will now have Buck to support her. The weeping Countess reveals that she has been funding Buck's radio career and that without her, he will be penniless and jobless. Crystal resigns herself to the fact that she will be heading back to the perfume counter, adding: \"And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society\u2014outside of a kennel.\" Mary, triumphant, heads out the door, arms wide open to receive Stephen.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Norma Shearer]] as Mary Haines\n* [[Joan Crawford]] as Crystal Allen\n* [[Rosalind Russell]] as Sylvia Fowler\n* [[Mary Boland]] as The Countess De Lave\n* [[Paulette Goddard]] as Miriam Aarons\n* [[Phyllis Povah]] as Edith Potter\n* [[Joan Fontaine]] as Peggy Day\n* [[Virginia Weidler]] as Little Mary Haines\n* [[Lucile Watson]] as Mrs. Morehead\n* [[Marjorie Main]] as Lucy\n* [[Virginia Grey]] as Pat, perfume counter clerk\n* [[Ruth Hussey]] as Miss Watson\n* [[Muriel Hutchison]] as Jane\n* [[Hedda Hopper]] as Dolly Dupuyster\n* [[Florence Nash]] as Nancy Blake\n* [[Cora Witherspoon]] as Mrs. Van Adams\n* [[Mary Beth Hughes]] as Miss Trimmerback\n* [[Lilian Bond]] as Mrs. Erskine\n* [[Dennie Moore]] as Olga, the manicurist\n* [[Jane Isbell]] as Edith's daughter (uncredited)\n* [[Mariska Aldrich]] as Singing Teacher (uncredited)\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Lulu, Perfume counter maid (uncredited)\n* [[Barbara Jo Allen]] as Receptionist (uncredited)\n* [[Judith Allen]] as \tCorset Model (uncredited)\n* [[Gertrude Astor]] as Mud bath attendant (uncredited)\n* [[Blossom Rock|Marie Blake]] as Stockroom girl (uncredited)\n* [[Suzanne Kaaren]] as \tPrincess Mara (uncredited)\n* [[Theresa Harris]] as Olive (uncredited)\n* [[Esther Dale]] as Ingrid (uncredited)\n* [[Betty Blythe]] as \tMrs. South (uncredited)\n* [[Barbara Pepper]] as Tough woman (uncredited)\n* [[Mabel Colcord]] as Woman Getting Massage (uncredited)\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as Dog in Salon (uncredited)\n}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Norma Shearer in The Women trailer 1.jpg|Norma Shearer\nFile:Joan Crawford in The Women.jpg|Joan Crawford\nFile:Rosalind Russell in The Women trailer 2.jpg|Rosalind Russell\nFile:Paulette Goddard in The Women trailer.jpg|Paulette Goddard\nFile:Joan Fontaine in The Women trailer.jpg|Joan Fontaine\nFile:Mary Boland in The Women trailer.jpg|Mary Boland\nFile:Virginia Weidler in The Women trailer.jpg|Virginia Weidler\nFile:Virginia Grey in The Women trailer.jpg|Virginia Grey\nFile:Phyllis Povah in The Women trailer.jpg|Phyllis Povah\nFile:Lucile Watson in The Women trailer.jpg| Lucille Watson\nFile:Marjorie Main in The Women trailer.jpg|Marjorie Main\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:The Women 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Lobby card]]]]\nIn January 1937, producers Harry M.

He described one technique for dealing with precedence: He made sure that all three stars were called to set simultaneously, either by sending separate staff to knock on their dressing room doors at the identical moment, or by calling \"Ready ladies!\" so all could hear. This system lapsed only once, and the offended star (not named) remained in her dressing room for a very long time.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Mr. Cukor: A Man Among 'The Women' | date=October 1, 1939 | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/10/01/94713263.html?pageNumber=140 | access-date=June 4, 2020 | work=The New York Times | language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen it comes to bloopers, the film contains a fine example of misused stock footage. The film transitions from Little Mary weeping in the bathroom over the news of the divorce through an [[establishing shot]]\u2014a night scene of a train speeding through a desert in the far West\u2014to the compartment where Mary consoles a weeping Peggy. Peggy barely managed to catch the train for [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. It is the first night out, and the train is nowhere near the West.

When interviewed by [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] host [[Robert Osborne]], director George Cukor stated that he did not like the sequence and that he wanted to remove it from the film. ''New York Times'' critic [[Frank Nugent]] agreed with this assessment. In his September 22, 1939, review of the film, he reported that \"a style show in Technicolor...may be lovely\u2014at least that's what most of the women around us seemed to think\u2014but has no place in the picture. Why not a diving exhibition or a number by the Rockettes?

Rosalind Russell, who usually is sympathetic as all-get-out, is flawless...as the archprowler in the Park Avenue jungle.

Like the female version, this would have involved an all masculine cast and the plot would have involved a man ([[Jeffrey Hunter]]) who recently discovers among his friends that his wife is having an affair with another man ([[Earl Holliman]]) and after going to Reno to file for divorce and begin a new life, he later finds himself doing what he can to rectify matters later on when he discovers that the other man is only interested in money and position and he decides to win his true love back again. Although nothing ever came of this, it would have consisted of the following ensemble: Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Heal), Earl Holliman (Christopher Allen), [[Tab Hunter]] (Simon Fowler), [[Lew Ayres]] (Count Vancott), [[Robert Wagner]] (Mitchell Aarons), [[James Garner]] (Peter Day), [[Jerry Mathers]] (Little Martin), [[James Stewart]] (Mr. Heal), [[Ronald Reagan]] (Larry), [[Troy Donahue]] (Norman Blake), and [[Stuart Whitman]] (Oliver, the bartender who spills the beans about the illicit affair).\n\nIn 1977 it was remade by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] for German television as ''Women in New York''.\n\nIn 2008, [[Diane English]] wrote and directed [[The Women (2008 film)|a remake of the same title]], her feature film directorial debut. The comedy starred [[Meg Ryan]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[Debra Messing]], and was released in 2008 by Picturehouse Entertainment, a sister company to Warner Bros.
