Unlike the 1976 version, which focused mainly on the police investigation and the murder trial (as did the book), this version focused mainly on [[Linda Kasabian|Linda Kasabian's]] involvement with the [[Manson Family]] and their development.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter breaking up with her husband, 19-year-old single mother Linda Kasabian seeks refuge with the [[Manson Family]] at [[Spahn Ranch]] and witnesses their indoctrination techniques. After attending the killings at the Sharon Tate house she flees Spahn Ranch but the Manson Family keeps her daughter in their custody, knowing that this will force her to return. Her daughter and all of the other children are taken by Social Services during a raid on Spahn Ranch after Manson burns municipal [[earthmoving equipment]] that he believes is being used to make it harder for him to find the \"bottomless pit\" that he believes is described in [[Revelation 9]] and \"[[Revolution 9]]\". The case is dropped due to an improperly executed warrant but confessions from Sadie and interviews with Kitty lead investigators to connect the Hinman, Tate, and LaBianca killings and issue warrants for the members of the Manson Family. Joey Dimarco and [[Paul Watkins (Manson Family)|Paul Watkins]] explain to the detectives how the words \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Pig\" found written in blood at the crime scenes are related to the worldview of the Manson Family derived from passages in the [[Book of Revelation]] and the lyrics of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], thereby connecting Manson's philosophy to the murders themselves as acts intended to spark a race war he dubbed \"Helter Skelter\". Manson dismisses his counsel and represents himself at trial but is deemed unfit after disrupting proceedings. Linda Kasabian is given an immunity deal and ends up giving detailed testimony at trial. The accused members of the Manson Family are ultimately convicted of the murders but California repeals the death penalty in 1972, making them all eligible for parole.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeremy Davies]] as [[Charles Manson]] \n* [[Clea DuVall]] as [[Linda Kasabian]] \n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as [[Susan Atkins]]\n* [[Allison Smith (actress)|Allison Smith]] as [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] \n* Frank Zieger as [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan|Steve Grogan]]\n* [[Eric Dane]] as [[Charles \"Tex\" Watson|Tex Watson]] \n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as [[Vincent Bugliosi]]\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as [[Lynette Fromme]] \n* Catherine Wadkins as [[Leslie Van Houten]]\n* [[Michael Weston]] as [[Bobby Beausoleil]] \n* [[Hal Ozsan]] as Joey Dimarco \n* [[Whitney Dylan]] as [[Sharon Tate]]\n* Marek Probosz as [[Roman Polanski]]\n* David Ackert as [[Jerry Rubin]]\n* Danielle De Cerbo as [[Bernardine Dohrn|Bernadine Dohrn]]\n* [[Rick Gomez]] as Milio \n* [[Robert Joy]] as Detective Morrisy \n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Jerry \n* [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as Sergeant Whiteley \n* [[Isabella Hofmann]] as [[Rosemary LaBianca]] \n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as [[Leno LaBianca]] \n* [[Yvonne Delarosa]] as [[Catherine Share]]\n* [[Chris Jacobs (television host)|Chris Jacobs]] as [[Dennis Wilson]]\n* [[Jeffrey Johnson (actor)|Jeffrey Johnson]] as [[Terry Melcher]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0383393}}\n\n{{Manson Family}}\n{{John Gray}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 television films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Snow]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Gray (director)]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1969]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Charles Manson]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about serial killers]]\n[[Category:Crime films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:The Wolper Organization films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Vincent Bugliosi]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n\n\n{{US-tv-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
