Rather than featuring one continuous narrative, the film expresses the influence of fandom and innocence through a collection of [[short film]]s about Jackson, several of which are long-form [[music video]]s from Jackson's 1987 album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dennis Hunt|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-10-ca-310-story.html|title=VIDEO REVIEW : 'Moonwalker': A Stroll Through a Super Ego|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 10, 1989|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> The film is named after the dance technique known as the [[Moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], which Jackson was known for performing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Amisu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6PiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160|title=The Dangerous Philosophies of Michael Jackson: His Music, His Persona, and His Artistic Afterlife|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=September 26, 2016|isbn = 9781440838651|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe film's segments are connected by an underlying but overall narrative meant to represent the different stages in Jackson's career and were based on his own view of how his fans idolized him rather than listening to the messages he wanted to say with his music.\n\n===\"Man in the Mirror\"===\nThe first segment of Moonwalker is a live performance of \"[[Man in the Mirror]]\" during his [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]] in Europe and America. Clips from [[Met Center]] in [[Minneapolis]] among others can be seen. It also features a montage of clips of children in [[Africa]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Jesus Christ]], kids in [[graduation]], and other historical figures.\n\n===\"Retrospective\"===\nThe second segment is a 10-minute [[biographical film]] about Jackson, covering the early years from [[The Jackson 5]] until the [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]].\n\n===\"Badder\"===\nThe third segment is a parody of the music video for [[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|''Bad''{{'}}s title song]], featuring children filling the roles of various people from the original clip. The video stars [[Brandon Quintin Adams]] (who also appears in the Smooth Criminal segment later in the film) as the young Michael Jackson, who would later star in ''[[The People Under the Stairs]]'', ''[[The Mighty Ducks (film)|The Mighty Ducks]]'' and ''[[The Sandlot]]''. It also featured three of Michael's nephews Jermaine La Jaune Jackson, Jr. along with [[Jackson family|TJ and Taryll Jackson]] and a young [[Nikki Cox]], who later starred in ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'' and ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]''. The singing group [[The Boys (Boy band)|The Boys]]  appeared as background dancers.\n\n===\"Speed Demon\"===\nThe fourth segment begins with the \"Badder\" short film transitioning into the second short film, \"Speed Demon\", produced by [[Claymation]] innovator [[Will Vinton]]. A portion of the clip is set to Jackson's song \"[[Speed Demon (song)|Speed Demon]]\". After filming \"Badder\", Little Michael and his bodyguards (also young kids) are leaving the set and walk through a cloud of smoke and come out as their regular adult age. As he exits the set, he is spotted by tourists and they suddenly begin to chase him for an autograph. In an attempt to avoid the overzealous fans and the interviewers (including camera-happy Japanese tourists accompanied by stereotyped \"Oriental\" music, the press, and even [[The Noid]]) plus some gunslingers (after stumbling upon the filming of a Western helmed by a director resembling [[Steven Spielberg]]), Jackson soon disguises himself as a rabbit named Spike, using a costume from one of the film sets (imbued with animatronic properties using Claymation, giving a similar combined-media effect as ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', but with more obvious bluescreening), but ends up taunting the fans into chasing him once they realize it is him.  Michael steals a bicycle which then turns into a motorcycle once he hits the highway in order to flee, with the fans and paparazzi (now also appearing in Claymation form) giving chase in various other, more cartoonish vehicles. During the chase, he morphs into other celebrities, namely [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Pee-wee Herman]], with the bike also briefly morphing (into a jackhammer, stop sign, waterski, and jet pack) in repeatedly unsuccessful attempts to throw the fans off. After a long chase, the fans/press are finally thwarted by crashing into a giant (Claymation) cop and are arrested. Michael finally then manages to escape and rides off to a desert. He takes off his rabbit costume and it then suddenly comes to [[Anthropomorphism|life]] and challenges him to an extended dance-off. In the end, a passing traffic cop interrupts Michael to point out he is in a \"No Dancing Zone\", and when Michael turns to show him that he was competing with the rabbit, he sees that the rabbit has disappeared. The cop then sarcastically asks for Michael's autograph (as opposed to \"signature\") on the ticket. Just as Michael is preparing to leave, the rabbit's head materializes on a nearby rocky crag, which then nods to him and smiles.\n\n===\"Leave Me Alone\"===\nThe fifth segment of the film is a surreal [[Animation|animated]] music video for the song \"[[Leave Me Alone (Michael Jackson song)|Leave Me Alone]]\", focusing on [[supermarket tabloid]] interest in Jackson's [[personal life]]. It compares Jackson's life to an amusement park, and how his fans just see him as such. It is meant to point out, in a mocking tone, the way the tabloids unnecessarily sensationalized his life with claims that he had a shrine to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and bought the Elephant Man's bones. In the video, Jackson's life is portrayed as a circus due to the press's manipulation and the everyday tug-of-war he endured as an artist. His beloved then-pet [[Common chimpanzee|chimp]] [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]] makes a cameo appearance as Jackson is seen picking him up and riding with him in his roller coaster car. His pet snake, Muscles, is also present. The press is portrayed with dog heads to insinuate that they are like animals. The segment ends with Jackson destroying the park, and looking off into space.\n\n===\"Smooth Criminal\"===\nThe segment begins with three homeless children (Sean, Katie, and Zeke) sneaking through a big city to see their friend Michael going out for the evening. As Michael stands in front of the door, he notices a falling star before he is ambushed by armed gunmen with machine guns. The film then backtracks to show Michael and the children playing in a meadow in happier times. As they're playing, their dog Skipper runs away, and as Michael and Katie look for him they uncover the lair of Mr. Big, whose real name Frankie Lideo is an allusion to [[Frank DiLeo]] (Michael Jackson's then-manager), is a drug-dealing mobster with an army of henchmen. He wants to get the entire population of Earth addicted to drugs, starting with children. As Mr. Big continues work on his operation, he discovers that Michael and Katie are spying on his operation. The story returns to the ambush in front of Michael's apartment. Unknown to the gangsters, Michael wished on the falling star and escaped the gunfire, leaving only his jacket. Upon realizing he has escaped again, Mr. Big orders his henchmen to track down Michael with dogs. He is eventually cornered in an alley, where he wishes on another falling star and turns into a [[Lancia Stratos|Lancia Stratos Zero]] sports car that mows down several of Mr. Big's henchmen. Michael is pursued through the city streets until he loses the henchmen. Meanwhile, the children scout out Club 30s, where Michael had told them to meet him, and find only an abandoned nightclub. As Michael arrives, Katie sees a silhouette of him turning back from a car into himself. The door of the club opens with a gust of wind, and Michael walks in to find it filled with [[zoot suit]]ers and swing dancers. The children gather outside a window of the club and watch Michael dance to \"[[Smooth Criminal]].\" Mr. Big lays siege to the club and kidnaps Katie. Michael follows them back to Big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. Mr. Big appears and taunts Michael by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to wriggle free, Mr. Big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill Katie before finishing off Michael, but not before a falling star flies by. Michael transforms into a giant robot and kills all of Mr. Big's soldiers, then turns into a spaceship. Mr. Big gets into a large hillside-mounted energy cannon, firing on the spaceship knocking it into a nearby ravine. The children are his next target, but the spaceship returns from the ravine in time to fire a beam in the cannon with Mr. Big inside, destroying it and finishing the villain once and for all. The children watch the ship fly into the night sky with a shower of light.\n\n===\"Come Together\"===\nIn the conclusion to \"Smooth Criminal\", Sean, Katie and Zeke return to the city, believing that Michael is gone forever. As the boys talk about Michael, Katie walks away crying and clutching a paper star. As she sits in a corner wishing for him to come back, the paper star flies out of her hand and Michael walks out of the night fog. He takes them back to ''Club 30's'', where they find that the club has turned into the backstage area of a concert. Michael's stage crew return the children's missing dog and then escort Michael onto the stage where he performs a cover of [[The Beatles]] song \"[[Come Together]]\" with the children watching and cheering him on from backstage.\n\n===Closing credits===\nDuring the closing credits, two more segments are shown. The first has [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] performing \"The Moon is Walking\" in Club 30's amidst behind-the-scenes clips. The second is a selection of slowed-down and sped-up clips from the \"[[Smooth Criminal]]\" segment, which was also used as an alternate music video to the song.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Jackson]] as Himself\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Frankie \"Mr. Big\" Lideo\n* Kellie Parker as Katie\n* [[Sean Lennon]] as Sean\n* [[Brandon Quintin Adams]] as Zeke / \"Smooth Criminal\" / \"Baby Bad\" / Michael \"Badder\"\n\n==Release==\nThe release of ''Moonwalker'' was originally scheduled to coincide with Jackson's 1987 album, ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]''. During the [[Film|theatrical]] release of ''Moonwalker'', Jackson was also embarking on the [[Bad (tour)|Bad World Tour]], his first tour as a solo performer. The film was released theatrically in Europe and South America, but [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] canceled plans for a Christmas 1988 theatrical release in the United States. ''Moonwalker'' was instead released on home video in the United States and Canada on January 10, 1989, just as the Bad World Tour finished. (His tour was supposed to finish sooner, but had been postponed due to some vocal strain, so it went on until the last week of January 1989.) The video had sold more than 800,000 copies in the United States by April 17, 1989.<ref name=\"RIAA\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150924153725/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=moonwalker&artist=michael%20jackson&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 RIAA Gold & Platinum Certification information] <!-- this is a really cumbersome URL! --></ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed reviews. Critics praised the music though complained that there was no plot and that it seemed like a series of music videos tied together. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ''Moonwalker'' \"seems unsure of what it was supposed to be. At the center of the pic is the \"Smooth Criminal\" segment, a musical/dramatic piece full of dancing, schmaltzy kids, sci-fi effects and blazing machine guns (directed by Academy Award winner Colin Chilvers, based on a story by Jackson). Around it are really just numerous Jackson music videos with little or no linkage. Although quite enjoyable the whole affair does not make for a structured or professional movie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793231.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |title=Moonwalker Review&nbsp;\u2014 Read Variety's Analysis Of The Movie ''Moonwalker'' |work=Variety |date=January 1, 1988 |access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Moonwalker'' was released on VHS, and remained #1 on ''Billboard'''s Video Chart for 22 weeks.<ref>{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/MJJLegion/status/819009503718948865|number=819009503718948865|title=On this day In 1989, Michael Jackson's iconic 'Moonwalker' movie was released on VHS!
