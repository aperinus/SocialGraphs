The film won an award for the best film in [[Un Certain Regard]] category at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. ''Beautiful People'' is set in [[London]] during the time of the [[Bosnian War]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn London during October 1993, England are playing the Netherlands in the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifiers]]. The [[Bosnian War]] is at its height, and refugees from former Yugoslavia are arriving. Football rivals and political adversaries from the Balkans all precipitate conflict and amusing situations. Meanwhile, the lives of four English families are affected in different ways by an encounter with the refugees; one of the families improbably becomes involved with a Balkan refugee through the England vs Netherlands match.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rosalind Ayres]] as Nora Thornton\n* [[Julian Firth]] as Edward Thornton\n* [[Charles Kay]] as George Thornton\n* [[Charlotte Coleman]] as Portia Thornton\n* Edward Jewesbury as Joseph Thornton\n* Danny Nussbaum as Griffin Midge\n* Heather Tobias as Felicity Midge\n* [[Roger Sloman]] as Roger Midge\n* Walentine Giorgiewa as Dzemila\n* Kenan Hudaverdi as railway worker\n* Faruk Pruti as Croat\n* [[Dado Jehan]] as Serb\n* Linda Basset as a nurse\n* Nicholas Farrel as Dr Mouldy\n* Thomas Goodridge as Youth on Mobile Phone\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was selected as an [[Un Certain Regard]] entry at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5381/year/1999.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Beautiful People |access-date= 2009-10-09 |work= festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars (out of four), and made several comparisons: ''Beautiful People'' \"loops and doubles back among several stories and characters, like Robert Altman's ''[[Short Cuts]]'' and Paul Thomas Anderson's ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''\"; \"it is fairly lighthearted, under the circumstances; like ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'', it enjoys the paradoxes that occur when you try to apply logic to war.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Beautiful People| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000303/REVIEWS/3030302/1023 | date= 3 March 2000 | publisher= Chicago Sun-Times | first= Roger|last= Ebert|author-link= Roger Ebert| access-date= 2013-01-31}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] gave it the same rating and made most of the same comparisons; according to Berardinelli, \"Dizdar has accomplished what few filmmakers are capable of&mdash;taking a serious subject and crafting an effective comedy from it that is defined by rich characters, genuine laughs, and an unpredictable plot.\" He concluded:<ref name=\"reelviews\">{{cite web| title= Beautiful People| url= http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/beautiful_people.html | publisher= ReelViews.net | first= James |last= Berardinelli |author-link= James Berardinelli| access-date= 2013-01-31}}</ref>\n<blockquote>After appearing as an 'Un Certain Regard entry in the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, ''Beautiful People'' received international acclaim through film festival screenings and during its regular U.K. release (the screenplay was nominated for a [[British Independent Film Award]]). However, the most impressive thing about this film is not the recognition it has received, but the accessibility of the humor. While ''Beautiful People'' is best described as a black comedy,... it is funny, not merely grimly amusing. This makes ''Beautiful People'' one of the most intriguing and thought-provoking comedies to reach U.S. theaters in early 2000.</blockquote>\n\nUnlike those made by Ebert and Berardinelli, the comparisons made by the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'' are more precise: the film \"combines British [[social realism]] with the bitter, jagged humor of Balkan directors like [[Emir Kusturica]] (''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'') and [[Srdjan Dragojevic]] (''[[Pretty Village, Pretty Flame]]'').\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Beautiful People| date= 6 March 2000 | url= http://www.filmvault.com/filmvault/boston/b/beautifulpeople1.html | work=[[Boston Phoenix]]|  publisher= filmvault.com | first= Scott |last= Heller| access-date= 2013-01-31}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Scott Tobias of the A.V. Club, \"Though its title seems ironic at first, ''Beautiful People'' is boundless in its optimism, growing increasingly contrived as it progresses, steering the messy lives of about 25 interconnected characters in the same hopeful direction....[Dizdar] displays a gift for light absurdist comedy... but as lively and skillfully orchestrated as it is on the whole, ''Beautiful People'' adds up to curiously little, limited in large part by Dizdar's narrow view of humanity. In his enthusiasm to resolve the cultural differences between his former and present home, his disparate characters are all tossed into the same flavorless, homogeneous soup.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Beautiful People| date= 3 March 2000 | url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/beautiful-people,20227/|  publisher= A.V.
