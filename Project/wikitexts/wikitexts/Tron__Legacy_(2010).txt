It serves as a [[sequel]] to ''[[Tron]]'' (1982), whose director [[Steven Lisberger]] returned to produce. The cast includes [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Bruce Boxleitner]] reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan Bradley, respectively, as well as [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[James Frain]], [[Beau Garrett]] and [[Michael Sheen]]. The story follows Flynn's adult son Sam, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a [[virtual reality]] called \"the Grid,\" where Sam, his father, and the [[algorithm]] Quorra must stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world.\n\nInterest in creating a sequel to ''Tron'' arose after the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]]. After much speculation, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise ''Tron: Legacy,'' with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not optimistic about Disney's ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]''-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a [[high-concept]], which he used to conceptualise the universe of ''Tron: Legacy'' and convince the studio to greenlight the film. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Vancouver]] over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in [[3D film|3D]] and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. [[Chroma keying]] and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. [[Daft Punk]] composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark [[electronic music]].<ref>{{cite web | title=SDCC: Comic-Con: Disney 3D Hits Hall H! | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=57418 | date=23 June 2009 | access-date=23 June 2009 | archive-date=26 July 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726080705/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=57418 | url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n''Tron: Legacy'' premiered in [[Tokyo]] on November 30, 2010 and was theatrically released in [[North America]] on December 17, 2010. Disney vigorously promoted the film across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics, who praised the visual effects, production design and [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], but criticized the character development, cast performance and story. The film grossed $400&nbsp;million during its worldwide theatrical run against a $170&nbsp;million production budget. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Inception]]''. Like its predecessor, ''Tron: Legacy'' has also been described as a [[cult film]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tjarks|first=Jonathan|date=2020-08-05|title='Tron: Legacy' Has a Cult Following for a Reason|url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/8/5/21354861/tron-legacy-cult-following|access-date=2020-08-06|website=The Ringer|language=en|archive-date=August 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805162001/https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/8/5/21354861/tron-legacy-cult-following|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-06-15|title=Watch: How 'Tron: Legacy' Built its Legacy with Visual Feats|url=https://nofilmschool.com/2017/06/watch-legacy-tron-legacy|access-date=2020-08-06|website=No Film School|language=en|archive-date=December 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201030829/https://nofilmschool.com/2017/06/watch-legacy-tron-legacy|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1989, Kevin Flynn, who was promoted to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of ENCOM International seven years earlier,{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of ''[[Tron]]'' (1982).}} disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's [[controlling interest|primary shareholder]], pranks the corporation by releasing the company's signature operating system online for free. ENCOM executive Alan Bradley, Flynn's old friend, approves of this, believing it aligns with Flynn's ideals of open software. Nonetheless, Sam is arrested for trespassing.\n\nAlan posts bail for Sam and tells him of a pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered [[Amusement arcade|video arcade]]. There Sam discovers a hidden basement with a large computer and laser, which suddenly digitizes and downloads him into the Grid, a [[virtual reality]] created by Flynn. He is captured and sent to \"the Games\", where he must fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and bleeds, Rinzler realizes Sam is human, or a \"User\". He takes Sam to Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program, who resembles a young Kevin.\n\nClu nearly kills Sam in a [[Tron (franchise)#Light cycles|Light Cycle]] match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \"apprentice\" of Flynn, who shows him Flynn's hideout outside Clu's territory. Flynn explains that he had been working to create a \"perfect\" computer system, and had appointed Clu and security program Tron as its co-creators. The trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \"[[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] [[algorithm]]s\" (ISOs), with the potential to resolve various natural mysteries. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. The \"Portal\" permitting travel between the two worlds closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Clu sent the message to Alan hoping to lure him into the Grid (though Sam serves his purpose just as well) and reopen the Portal for a limited time. Since Flynn's \"identity disc\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.\n\nAgainst his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory to find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. At the [[newline|End of Line]] Club, the owner reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu over the disc, but Clu betrays him and destroys the club along with Zuse. Flynn and Sam stow away aboard a \"Solar Sailer\" transport program, where Kevin restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO.\n\nThe transport is intercepted by Clu's warship. As a diversion, Quorra allows herself to be captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, not killed by Clu but rather reprogrammed. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Rinzler remembers his past as Tron and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, then falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the Portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself, while Quorra - having switched discs with Flynn - gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together to the real world as the resulting explosion levels the Sea of Simulation. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then tells a waiting Alan that he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Alan chairman of the board. Sam departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 150\n| footer    = Top to bottom: [[Garrett Hedlund]], [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Olivia Wilde]] star in the film.\n| image1    = Garrett Hedlund by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      = Garrett Hedlund in front of a microphone during a press conference.\n| image2    = Jeff Bridges by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| alt2      = Jeff Bridges in front of a microphone during a press conference.\n| image3    = Olivia Wilde by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt3      = Olivia Wilde in a press conference.\n}}\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as [[List of Tron characters#Sam Flynn|Samuel \"Sam\" Flynn]], a primary shareholder of ENCOM who, while investigating his father's disappearance, is transported onto the Grid himself.<ref name=\"reuters\">{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Little known actor lands lead in 'Tron' sequel |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tron/little-known-actor-lands-lead-in-tron-sequel-idUSTRE5061SZ20090107 |date=January 7, 2009 |work=Reuters/Hollywood Reporter |access-date=December 24, 2010 |publisher=Reuters |archive-date=October 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020084209/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tron/little-known-actor-lands-lead-in-tron-sequel-idUSTRE5061SZ20090107 |url-status=live }}</ref> Hedlund won a \"Darwinian casting process\" which tested hundreds of actors, being chosen for having the \"unique combination of intelligence, wit, humor, look and physicality\" that the producers were looking for in Flynn's son.

At the time, the film had just wrapped production and they had a year of post production ahead of them. Because none of the footage from inside the computer world was finished, they premiered concept images from the production. Art included the Recognizer, which has been updated from the original film.

The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a ''Tron'' stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in the wall behind the ''Tron'' game and entering it, the passage closing behind him.

As the design team considered the lights a major part of the ''Tron'' look, particularly for being set in a dark world\u2014described by effects art director Ben Procter as \"dark silhouetted objects dipped in an atmosphere with clouds in-between, in a kind of Japanese [[Landscape art|landscape painting]]\" where \"the self-lighting of the objects is the main light source\"\u2014lighting was spread through every prop on the set, including the floor in Flynn's hideout.<ref name=design/> Lisberger also stated that while the original ''Tron'' \"reflected the way cyberspace was,\" the sequel was \"going to be like a modern day, like contemporary plus, in terms of how much resolution, the texturing, the feel, the style,\" adding that \"it doesn't have that [[Pong]] Land vibe to it anymore.\"<ref name=lis>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/steven-lisberger-on-set-interview-tron-legacy-read-or-listen-here/19387/|title=Steven Lisberger On Set Interview TRON LEGACY \u2013 Read or Listen Here|work=Collider.com|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|date=March 15, 2010|access-date=September 26, 2012|archive-date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405173813/http://collider.com/steven-lisberger-on-set-interview-tron-legacy-read-or-listen-here/19387/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe skintight suits worn by the actors were reminiscent of the outfits worn by the actors in the original film.<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |title=First Costumed Tron 2 Actor Revealed |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/first-costumed-tron-2-actor-revealed/ |publisher=Show Hype |date=April 10, 2009 |access-date=March 12, 2010 |archive-date=November 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123014754/http://www.slashfilm.com/first-costumed-tron-2-actor-revealed/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Kosinski believed that the costumes could be made to be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing the lighted costumes, which used electroluminescent lamps derived from a flexible polymer film and featured hexagonal patterns.<ref name=3d2/><ref name=lights2>{{cite web |title = Tron Legacy: Light Suit Costume |first = Chris |last = Laverty |url = http://clothesonfilm.com/tron-legacy-light-suit-costume/15850/ |publisher = Clothes on Film |date = November 9, 2010 |access-date = June 14, 2012 |archive-date = June 3, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120603042903/http://clothesonfilm.com/tron-legacy-light-suit-costume/15850/ |url-status = live }}</ref> The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of [[Honeywell]] lamination and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent [[3M]] Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to lamination.<ref name=lights2/> While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics.<ref name=3d2/> In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes.<ref name=3d2/> On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 [[LED]] lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled.<ref name=3d2/> All the costumes had to be sewn in such a way that the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures.<ref name=design/> According to [[Neville Page]], the lead designer for the helmets, \"The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joe's [...] vision. We would look over each other's shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film.\"<ref name=lights2/>\n\nThe majority of the suits were designed using [[ZBrush]].<ref name=lights2/> A scan of an actor's body was taken, which was then encased to decipher the fabric, the location of the foam, amongst other concerns. With a computer numerical cutting (CNC) of dense foam, a small scale output would be created to perfect fine details before initiating construction of the suit. Upon downloading the participant's body scan, the illustrations were overlaid to provide an output manufacturing element.<ref name=lights2/> Describing the CNC process, Chris Lavery of Clothes on Film noted that it had a tendency to elicit bubbles and striations.<ref name=lights2/> Clark stated: \"The [...] suit is all made of a hexagon mesh which we also printed and made the fabric from 3D files. This would go onto the hard form; it would go inside the mould which was silicon matrix. We would put those together and then inject foam into the negative space. The wiring harness is embedded into the mould and you get a torso. We then paint it and that's your finished suit.\"<ref name=lights2/>\n\n===Sound and visual effects===\n[[File:CluTronLegacy.jpg|thumb|left|The likeness of a 35-year-old [[Jeff Bridges]] was taken from the 1984 film ''[[Against All Odds (1984 film)|Against All Odds]]'' as opposed to the [[Tron|original ''Tron'']].<ref name=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/visual-effects/are-tron-legacys-3d-fx-ahead-of-their-time-2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/visual-effects/are-tron-legacys-3d-fx-ahead-of-their-time-2 | title=What Will Tron: Legacy's 3D VFX Look Like in 30 Years? | access-date=April 22, 2012 | archive-date=January 26, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126090845/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/visual-effects/are-tron-legacys-3d-fx-ahead-of-their-time-2 | url-status=live }}</ref>|alt=A man wearing a black jumpsuit with yellow flashing lines stares at another, wearing a jumpsuit with blue lines.]]\nCrowd effects for the gaming arena were recorded at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].
