The film would end-up in the package of films sold to [[Associated Artists Productions]] in 1956, that company would be sold to [[United Artists]] two years later.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThis is the plot of the original 1932 film, as it aired on Turner Classic Movies. The film suffered from editing and censorship even at its initial release. (See below.)\n\nOn the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]] during World War I, Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American architect serving as an officer on an ambulance in the [[Italian Army]], delivers some wounded soldiers to a hospital. While out carousing with his friend, Italian Captain Rinaldi, they are interrupted by a bombing raid. Frederic and English [[Red Cross]] nurse Catherine Barkley, who fled from the nurses\u2019 dormitory in her nightclothes, take shelter in the same dark stairwell. The somewhat drunk Frederic makes a poor first impression.\n\nRinaldi persuades Frederic to go on a double date with him and two nurses, who turn out to be Catherine and her friend Helen Ferguson, or \"Fergie\". During a concert for officers and nurses, Frederic and Catherine walk into the garden, and Catherine reveals that she had been engaged for eight years to a soldier who was killed in battle. Away by themselves, he tries to kiss her and she slaps him, but after they talk more, she asks him to kiss her again. In the darkness, he romantically seduces her, over her resistance, and is taken aback and touched to discover she was a virgin. Frederic tells her he loves her.\n\nIn the morning, three ambulances, including Frederic's, are leaving for what will be known as the [[Second Battle of the Piave River]]. Frederic finds Catherine and tells her that he will be away and that he wants her to know that what happened between them was important to him, and that he will survive the battle unscathed. Catherine gives him the St. Anthony medal she wears around her neck. Rinaldi observes all of this, and then enters a major's office where it is revealed that Rinaldi had orchestrated the separation to prevent Frederic from being with Catherine. The head nurse then suggests sending Catherine back to base, but instead, the Major transfers Catherine to [[Milan]].\n\nAt the front, Frederic is badly wounded in the legs and head when an artillery shell blows up his bunker. Frederic is sent to the hospital in Milan where he receives a chilly reception from Fergie while Catherine rushes to his bed to embrace him. Later that night, an Italian Army chaplain known as \"Padre\" visits Frederic and sees that he and Catherine are lovers. He asks if they would marry if they could, and they answer \"yes\". He then performs an unofficial wedding service for the couple.\n\nMonths later, Catherine and Frederic ask Fergie for their wedding, who rejects the offer saying they won't marry due to the war. As she leaves, she warns Frederic that if he gets Catherine pregnant, she will kill him. Back at the hospital, Frederic is told his convalescent leave is canceled. While waiting for his train, Catherine confides to Frederic that she is scared of each of them dying. He promises he will always come back, and they kiss before he leaves. Catherine then meets with Fergie and reveals to her that she is pregnant and is going to Switzerland to have the child.\n\nWhile apart, Catherine writes letters to Frederic, never revealing her pregnancy. In Turin, Rinaldi tries to entice Frederic to have some fun, but Frederic is intent on writing to Catherine. Rinaldi, unbeknownst to Frederic, is having all letters from Catherine \"Returned to sender\". Meanwhile, the hospital at Milan returns all of Frederic's letters to him, marked \"person unknown.\" He tells the Padre that he is deserting and going to Milan to find Catherine.\n[[File:A Farewell to Arms - The Film Daily, Jul-Dec 1932 (page 866 crop).jpg|thumb|352x352px|A Farewell to Arms ad from ''[[The Film Daily]]'', 1932]]\nFrederic makes it to Milan but finds only Fergie is there, who refuses to tell him anything except that Catherine was pregnant and is gone. Rinaldi meets Frederic at a hotel where Frederic reveals that Catherine is going to have a baby. Rinaldi, realizing his mistakes, tells Frederic that she is in [[Brissago]], Switzerland and helps Frederic get there, apologizing for keeping the lovers apart.\n\nMeanwhile, Catherine discovers that all of the letters to Frederic have been returned, marked \"Return to Sender\". She goes into labor and is taken to the hospital where she endures prolonged and unproductive labor. As Frederic arrives, Catherine is wheeled into the operating room for a [[Caesarean section]]. After the operation, the surgeon tells Frederic that the baby, a boy, died in the womb long before Catherine came to the hospital.\n\nWhen Catherine regains consciousness, she and Frederic exchange heartbreaking endearments and plan the future, until Catherine panics and begs Frederic to hold her tight because she is going to die and is afraid. He soothes her and tells her they can never really be parted. She tells him she is not afraid and dies in Frederic's arms as the sun rises. Frederic picks up her body and turns slowly toward the window, sobbing \"Peace, Peace.\"\n\n===Ending===\nThis is the film's original ending when released to international audiences in 1932.  Some prints for American audiences had a happy ending, where Catherine did not die, and some were ambiguous;  some theaters were offered a choice.<ref name=notes>{{cite web| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/74574/A-Farewell-to-Arms/notes.html| title=A Farewell to Arms (1932) \u2013 Notes| website=Turner Classic Movies| language=en| access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref> The censors were concerned about more than just the heroine's death.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/74574/A-Farewell-to-Arms/home-video-reviews.html| title=A Farewell to Arms (1932) \u2013 Home Video Reviews| website=Turner Classic Movies| language=en| access-date=September 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=notes/>  Versions proliferated when a much more powerful [[Motion Picture Production Code]] got hold of the picture before various re-releases to film and television, not to mention the effects of a change of ownership to Warner Bros. and lapse into the [[public domain]].\n\nAccording to TCM.com: \" \u2018A Farewell to Arms\u2019 originally ran 89 minutes, and was later cut to 78 minutes for a 1938 re-issue.

Gary Cooper gives an earnest and splendid portrayal [and] Helen Hayes is admirable as Catherine ... another clever characterization is contributed by Adolphe Menjou ... it is unfortunate that these three players, serving the picture so well, do not have the opportunity to figure in more really dramatic interludes.<ref name=\"nytimes-review\">{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |title=Helen Hayes, Gary Cooper and Adolphe Menjou in a Film of Hemingway's \"Farewell to Arms.\" |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 9, 1932 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9902E0DD1F31E333A2575AC0A9649D946394D6CF |access-date=September 18, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2006, Dan Callahan of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' noted, \"Hemingway ... was grandly contemptuous of Frank Borzage's version of ''A Farewell to Arms'' ... but time has been kind to the film.
