It was written by John William Corrington and Joyce Corrington, based on the 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' by [[Richard Matheson]]. The film's producer, [[Walter Seltzer]], went on to work with Heston again in the [[dystopia]]n science-fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]'' in 1973.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/20/local/la-me-seltzer-20110220|title=Walter Seltzer dies at 96; former Hollywood press agent made a successful leap to producing|author=Nelson, Valerie J.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2011-02-20|access-date=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\n''The Omega Man'' is the second adaptation of Matheson's novel. The first was ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964), which starred [[Vincent Price]].

Please do not alter it or make it unnecessarily longer.-->\n\nIn March 1975, a [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] escalates into full-scale war in which [[biological warfare]] destroys most of the human race. U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D., is a scientist based in [[Los Angeles]]. As he begins to succumb to the [[Pandemic|plague]], he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering him immune.\n\nBy August 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \"the Family\", a [[cult]] of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal [[albinism|albino]] [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]]s. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a [[Fortification|fortified]] apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home.\n\nOne day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman, who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside, but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. He also finds the dead body of a mutant -although they survived the plague the disease will eventually kill them.\n\nOn another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a [[show trial|summary trial]], he is found guilty of [[heresy]] by the Family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly [[burned at the stake]] in [[Dodger Stadium]]. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, all of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it, and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if duplicating the original vaccine is possible,  salvaging humanity would take years. He believes extending his immunity to others may be possible  by creating a [[Serum (blood)|serum]] from his own blood.\n \nNeville and Lisa return to Neville's apartment, where they begin treating Lisa's brother Richie, who is succumbing to the disease. Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening together, just as the generator runs out of fuel and the lights go off. The Family then attacks, sending Matthias' second-in-command, Brother Zachary, to climb up the outside of Neville's building to the open balcony of his apartment. Neville leaves Lisa upstairs as he goes to the basement garage to restart the generator. Neville returns to the apartment to find Zachary right behind an unsuspecting Lisa. Neville shoots him and he falls off the balcony to his death, dropping his spear on the balcony as he goes.\n\nIf the serum works, Neville and Lisa plan to leave the ravaged city with the rest of the survivors, and start new lives in the wilderness, leaving the Family behind to die. Neville is successful in creating the serum and administers it to Richie. Once cured, Richie reveals the Family's headquarters to Neville (the [[Los Angeles Civic Center]]), but insists that the Family is also human and that Neville's cure should be administered to them, as well. Neville disagrees with him, so Richie goes to the Family by himself to try to convince them to take the serum. Matthias refuses to believe that Neville would try to help them, accuses Richie of being sent to spy on them, and has him executed. After finding a note that Richie left, Neville rushes to rescue him, but instead finds his dead body tied to a judge's chair in a courtroom.\n\nMeanwhile, Lisa quickly and unexpectedly succumbs to the disease and becomes one of the Family. Returning home, Neville tells Lisa about Richie's death, but she already knows and has betrayed Neville by giving Matthias and his followers access to Neville's home. Matthias, who finally has the upper hand, forces Neville to watch as the Family sets his home and equipment on fire. Neville breaks free, and once outside with Lisa, he turns and raises his gun to shoot Matthias, who is looking down from the balcony. The gun jams, giving Matthias enough time to hurl Zachary's spear at Neville, mortally wounding him. The next morning, Dutch and the survivors discover Neville dying in a fountain. He hands Dutch a flask of the blood serum, and then dies. Dutch takes Lisa (weakened and compliant because of the sunlight) away, and the survivors leave the city forever.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Charlton Heston]] as Robert Neville\n*[[Anthony Zerbe]] as Jonathan Matthias\n*[[Rosalind Cash]] as Lisa\n*[[Paul Koslo]] as Dutch\n*[[Eric Laneuville]] as Richie\n*[[Lincoln Kilpatrick]] as Zachary\n*[[Brian Tochi]] as Tommy\n\n==Production==\nThe film differs from the novel (and the previous film) in several ways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moria.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2786Itemid=0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907035020/http://www.moria.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2786Itemid=0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=The Science-Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review |publisher=Moria |access-date=2011-09-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=6432&reviewer=402&printer=1 |title=Movie Review \u2013 Omega Man, The |publisher=eFilmCritic |access-date=2011-09-05 |archive-date=2012-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306042307/http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=6432&reviewer=402&printer=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the novel, humanity is destroyed by a bacterial plague spread by bats and mosquitoes, which turns the population into [[vampire]]-like creatures; whereas, in this film version, biological warfare is the cause of the plague that kills most of the population by asphyxiation and turns most of the rest into nocturnal albino mutants.

As it turns out, the scene was felt to fit quite well into the storyline, so was left in.\n\nThe film takes place in Los Angeles,  and as part of the plot, the city is supposed to be void of human activity except for Neville. Several tricks were used to make the city appear deserted. This was accomplished in part by simply filming on a Sunday morning in the center of the business district, which in late 1970 was essentially devoid of pedestrian movement early on weekend mornings.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charlton Heston|title=In the Arena|year=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-684-80394-1|page=441}}</ref> Despite careful planning by the film crew, bystanders were captured on film in the distance, and moving cars appear briefly in the background during some scenes.\n\n===Interracial kiss===\n[[File:TheOmegaMan.jpg|thumb|Charlton Heston and Rosalind Cash about to kiss in a scene from ''The Omega Man'']]\n\n[[Whoopi Goldberg]] has remarked that the kiss between the characters played by Charlton Heston and Rosalind Cash was one of the first interracial kisses to appear in a movie.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/0f7vrj5VBNY Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180518142114/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f7vrj5VBNY&feature=related Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f7vrj5VBNY|title=Goldberg Discussing Interview with Heston|publisher=YouTube |access-date=2011-09-05}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/07/whoopi-goldberg-remembers_n_95411.html|title=Whoopi Goldberg Remembers Charlton Heston; Plants One on Joy&#124;|work = Huffington Post|date = 2008-04-07|access-date=2011-10-17}}</ref> In 1992, when Goldberg had her own network interview talk show, she invited Heston to be a guest, and asked him about the kiss.

Corrington stated that in developing the script for ''The Omega Man,'' the character of Lisa, played by Rosalind Cash, was created due to the rise of the [[Black Power movement]], which was particularly prominent in American culture at the time the film was made.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> She goes on to remark that this created an effective and interesting dynamic between the characters of Lisa and Neville.\n\nHeston wrote in his autobiography that ''The Omega Man'' was Cash's first leading role in a film, and that she was understandably \"a little edgy\" about doing a love scene with him. Heston explained, \"It was in the seventies that I realized a generation of actors had grown up who saw me in terms of the iconic roles they remembered from their childhoods. 'It's a spooky feeling,' she told me, 'to screw Moses.'\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Charlton Heston|title=In the Arena|year=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=0-684-80394-1|page=443}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scene===\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\nThe script for ''The Omega Man'' contains a scene in which Lisa visits her parents' grave. Unknown to Neville, Lisa is pregnant, and she seeks comfort from her deceased parents before Neville and she leave the city forever. While Lisa is talking to her parents' grave, she hears a sound and investigates a crypt. In it, she spots a female Family member depositing a dead newborn mutant. Lisa can see the mother's grief and empathizes with the woman's loss, despite their being on different sides. Lisa believes that all children, including her unborn baby, will suffer the same fate. Later, Lisa returns to Neville and tells him of the woman in the crypt. Neville asks Lisa if she \"took care\" of things and Lisa responds that since she may be a grieving parent in a few months, she will not kill a grief-stricken mother. Neville is shocked at first, but then embraces Lisa. While the scene was cut from the final film, the screen credit for \"Woman in Cemetery Crypt\" remains.\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened at three theaters in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in July 1971.<ref name=varrev/><ref name=open>{{cite magazine|title='Omega' Fat $29,900, Houston; 'Sunday' Slick $15,400, 'Richthofen' Fair $4,100|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 4, 1971|page=12}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nAt the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Omega Man'' received mixed reviews, with a combined average positive score of 65% from 34 critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/omega_man/ |title=The Omega Man |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2011-09-05}}</ref> [[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] gave a mostly negative review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', saying \"the climax is as florid and phony as it can be,\"<ref name=\"nytimes1971\">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Omega Man (1971) Screen: All Alone in L.A.:Charlton Heston Stars in 'The Omega Man'|first=Howard|last=Thompson|date=August 14, 1971|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E1DA1E3FE63ABC4C52DFBE66838A669EDE}}</ref> while A.D.
