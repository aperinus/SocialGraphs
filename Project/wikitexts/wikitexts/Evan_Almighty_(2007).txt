The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], written by [[Steve Oedekerk]], based on the characters created by [[Steve Koren]] and [[Mark O'Keefe (screenwriter)|Mark O'Keefe]] from the original film. It stars [[Steve Carell]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with new cast members [[Lauren Graham]] and [[John Goodman]]. The film is a modern-day retelling of [[Noah's Ark]], which Evan reluctantly re-enacts because God commands him to do so and will stop at nothing to make him do it even as Evan pursues a new career in government.\n\nProduction of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive comedy film]] ever (this record was later overtaken by ''[[Men in Black 3]]''). In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.\n\nThe film opened on June 22, 2007, and [[Box-office bomb|made less than its budget]] of $175 million worldwide, while receiving generally negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nNewly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]] from the original ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'', and later moves to the community of Prestige Crest, located in the fictional town of Huntsville, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan, also prays that she, Evan, and their three sons will be closer together as a family. On his first day working at Congress, Evan receives a letter from his greedy boss, Congressman Chuck Long, who provides him with a prime office and gives the opportunity to join him as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:\n\n* Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered there\n* Pairs of animals start following him around everywhere he goes, with birds flying into his office through the window\n* He begins to grow a beard, which grows back whenever he shaves it\n* His hair grows uncontrollably\n* His clothes are replaced with robes.\n* The number 614 starts appearing in various forms throughout his daily routines\n\nEvan comes to realize that 614 actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an ark]] in preparation for a [[Flood myth|coming flood]]. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God Himself starts appearing to Evan and assures him that a flood will come and the only way he can change the world will be through building the ark. Evan decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, although Joan sees this as a midlife crisis.\n\nAlthough Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his three staffers and the animals that follow him everywhere become disruptive. God reappears to Evan and provides him a robe, and later warns him the flood will likely come mid-day on September 22. When God indefinitely exposes Evan's robe, Long fires him from Congress and has his name removed from the Public Land Act bill. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him behind, causing Evan to continue building the ark alone. Meanwhile, God disguises Himself as a waiter in a restaurant and later speaks to Joan. God assures Joan that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to help Evan finish building the ark together to prepare for the flood.\n\nOn September 22, Evan's three staffers show him evidence that Long had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. They suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. With the ark finally complete, the animals board two by two, the police threaten to destroy it with a wrecking ball as it violates land codes, and rain falls. Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing, and warns the onlookers to get aboard the ark. The dam indeed fails, destroying all the homes of Prestige Crest. The ark rides the flood down the streets of [[Washington, D.C.]] and comes to a halt in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], interrupting the vote for the Public Land Act Bill. The flood results in Evan accusing Long of being responsible for cost-cutting leading to the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.\n\nCongress investigates Long for profiteering and all the animals return to their natural habitats. Evan is reinstated to Congress after the flood, and the changes imposed onto him by God no longer remain. Evan re-encounters God during a family hike. God states that Evan had changed his world as he prayed for and being closer to his family through his one [[Random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK). \n\nGod reveals a new commandment to the outgoing audience: \"Thou shalt do the dance\", followed by the film's cast and crew members dancing to the [[C+C Music Factory]] song \"[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]\" during the closing credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Evan Baxter / [[Noah]], a former news reporter who is now a congressman\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[God in Christianity|God]]\n* [[Lauren Graham]] as Joan Baxter, Evan's wife\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Dylan Baxter, Evan and Joan's oldest son\n* [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Jordan Baxter, Evan and Joan's middle son\n* [[Jimmy Bennett]] as Ryan Baxter, Evan and Joan's youngest son\n* [[John Goodman]] as Congressman Chuck Long, a senior congressman\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Marty Stringer, Evan's chief of staff\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Rita Daniels, Evan's executive assistant\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Eugene Tennanbaum, one of Evan's staffers\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Eve Adams, the Baxters' real estate agent\n<!-- end of poster billing, rest from credits -->\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Ed Carson (Ark Reporter)\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Ark Reporter\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Builder\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Congressman Burrows\n* Madison Mason as Congressman Dodd\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as Congressman Hughes\n* [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]] as Congressman Stamp\n* [[Jim Doughan]] and [[Meagen Fay]] as Neighbors\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Officer Collins\n* [[Jon Stewart]] has a cameo appearance as himself\n* [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Susan Ortega (Uncredited)\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as [[Mail carrier|Mail Carrier]]\n* [[Lisa Arch]] and [[Simon Helberg]] as staffers\n* [[David Barrera]] as Ark reporters\n* Ruth Williamson as neighbor\n* Michael Roper as Congressional Reporter\n* Emily Eby as Animal Wrangler\n* [[Bart the Bear 2]] and Honey Bump as bears\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe film's screenplay was originally titled ''The Passion of the Ark'' and was written by [[Bobby Florsheim]] and [[Josh Stolberg]].<ref name=\"KillerMoviess\">{{cite news|url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |publisher=Killer Movies |title=Columbia Get \"The Passion Of The Ark\" |access-date=March 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152214/http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004.

In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" /> [[Lighting]] was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] stage, and the [[visual effects]] company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" />\n\n[[File:Huntsville Festival of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for ''Evan Almighty'' filming.]]\nRhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months.
