It is the first film of Van Sant's \"[[Gus Van Sant#Death Trilogy|Death Trilogy]],\" three films based on deaths that occurred in real life, and is succeeded by ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' (2003) and ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005).\n\n''Gerry'' follows two hiking companions who both go by the name \"Gerry.\" \"Gerry\" is also a slang term, used by both protagonists throughout the misadventure, meaning \"to screw up.\"<ref name=\"bos\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/movies/film/documents/02720644.htm |title=Boston Phoenix - Filmculture&#124; Gerry meandering |access-date=2006-09-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227031652/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/movies/film/documents/02720644.htm |archive-date=2006-02-27 }}</ref> Van Sant revealed in interviews that Damon, Affleck and his brother [[Ben Affleck|Ben]] had already coined the term before the movie had been named.<ref name=\"bos\"/>\n\nThe film's plot shares some commonalities with the events surrounding the [[David Coughlin|death of David Coughlin]], who was killed after he and a friend became lost in [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park|Rattlesnake Canyon]] in [[New Mexico]]. The film's style was largely inspired by the work of Hungarian director [[B\u00e9la Tarr]], namely its use of extended scenes playing out in uncut master shots. There are a few direct visual quotations from Tarr's ''[[S\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3]]'' such as a shot following the two protagonists while tumbleweeds blow around them that mimics a shot in Tarr's film where two men walk through a town as a windstorm blows around leaves and trash.\n\nBesides the work of B\u00e9la Tarr, the video game ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' was cited as an influence on the style of the film. Van Sant had mentioned that he hadn't had much experience with video games and was struck by the fact that the lack of the ability to cut away from the action in video games meant having to stay with the characters during travel that would normally be glossed over in films. In an interview with ''Filmmaker Magazine'' Van Sant stated \"In some ways, Gerry is B\u00e9la Tarr fused with ''Tomb Raider''!\"<ref name=\"Macaulay\">{{cite web|last1=Macaulay|first1=Scott|title=Filmmaker Magazine Interviews Gus Van Sant|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter2002/features/sands_time.php|website=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Gerry'' is frequently cited as an example of [[Non-narrative film|non-narrative cinema]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe characters drive to a remote location to hike at a site marked \"Wilderness Trail\". As they start, they see some other hikers passing by. In order to not be bothered by these hikers, they decide to go off-trail. After some walking, talking, and an impromptu foot race, they decide to head back. Before long, they realize that they are lost. That night, they build a campfire.\n\nOver the next couple of days, the two hikers wander through the wilderness without food or water. They try to split up for a while, retrace their steps and follow some animal tracks, all to no avail. They grow increasingly irritated with each other as the situation becomes dire.\n\nThey eventually find themselves slowly walking mostly in silence through a desert. They finally collapse due to fatigue and [[dehydration]]. The weaker of the two (Affleck) proclaims that he is \"leaving\", and reaches towards Damon's character. Damon's character rolls on top of Affleck and wordlessly strangles him before collapsing again.\n\nAfter some time, Damon's character awakens and realises that a highway is not far away. In the final sequence, he is badly sunburned but watches the passing landscape from the car of the father and son who have seemingly rescued him.\n\n==Production==\nThe inspiration for the film was the real-life [[murder of David Coughlin]], which Damon related to Van Sant, in which Coughlin and his best friend got lost in the desert, with the latter eventually killing Coughlin.<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Van Sant deliberately chose not to look up more information on the event because \"we didn't want to do their story,\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> instead deciding it would be \"an inspirational aside.\"<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=Interview: Gus Van Sant|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/gerrymandering-an-interview-with-gus-van-sant|website=Slant Magazine|date=15 June 2003 |access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nBesides the news item, other influences include Van Sant's own experience getting lost<ref name=\"Slant\"/> as well as [[Chantal Akerman]]'s ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Cinema/News/Chantal-Akerman-retour-sur-la-carriere-d-une-cineaste-discrete-3002285 |title=Chantal Akerman : Retour sur la carri\u00e8re d'une cin\u00e9aste influente - Elle |access-date=2016-03-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302140631/http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Cinema/News/Chantal-Akerman-retour-sur-la-carriere-d-une-cineaste-discrete-3002285 |archive-date=2016-03-02 }}</ref> Initially Van Sant planned to shoot the film with [[digital video]], which he said would have resembled \"a [[John Cassavetes]] film in the desert.\"<ref name=\"AVclubint\"/> Casey Affleck eventually convinced him to use [[35 mm movie film|35 mm film]] instead, with Van Sant noting, \"once we did that, everything changed\".<ref name=\"AVclubint\"/> From this decision he began incorporating influences from the film work of [[B\u00e9la Tarr]], specifically his use of [[long take]]s.<ref name=\"AVclubint\">{{cite web|last1=Tobia|first1=Scott|title=Gus Van Sant|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/gus-van-sant-13800|website=AV Club|date=5 March 2003 |access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film is notable for its lack of [[dialogue]]. Initially Van Sant \"thought we were definitely going to have a lot of long bits of soul-searching dialogue.\" During shooting this never came to pass, and Van Sant asserted that the long silences were \"our version\" of such dialogue.<ref name=Sandot>{{cite web|title=SANDS OF TIME|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter2002/features/sands_time.php#.WMpXjzsrLIU|website=Film maker magazine}}</ref> Van Sant wanted the spare dialogue not to cover things for the audience's sake; he explained, \"When [Matt and Casey] are talking, they\u2019re just talking and not pointing out stuff that we\u2019re supposed to know. If they\u2019re talking about something, and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, then that\u2019s okay. So long as they know what they\u2019re talking about.\"<ref name=Sandot/>\n\nVan Sant hoped to shoot the film in [[Argentina]] to avoid a possible [[Screen Actors Guild|Actors Guild]] strike, but the location proved colder than anticipated. He then looked to [[Wadi Rum]] in [[Jordan (country)|Jordan]], but he was dissuaded from going there because a [[travel advisory]] was in effect due to potential terrorist activities.<ref name=\"AVclubint\"/> The team finally settled on [[Death Valley]], California.<ref name=\"AVclubint\"/> Although the film had a script, it was used as more of an outline, and the team regularly disregarded it.<ref name=Sandot/> They were unsure of how the film would end if the film was shot in sequence.<ref name=\"AVclubint\"/>\n\nThe film is dedicated to the memory of American writer [[Ken Kesey]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Film Review: Gerry|url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2003-03-21/150015/|website =Austinchronicle.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received generally mixed critical reviews.
