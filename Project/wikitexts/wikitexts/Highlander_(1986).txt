It stars [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Roxanne Hart]], [[Clancy Brown]], and [[Sean Connery]]. The film chronicles the climax of an age-old war between [[Immortal (Highlander)|immortal]] warriors, depicted through interwoven past and present-day storylines. It is the first film in the [[Highlander (franchise)|''Highlander'' franchise]].\n\n[[Connor MacLeod]] (Lambert) is born in the [[Scottish Highlands]] in the 16th century. After reviving from a fatal wound and being banished from his village, MacLeod is found by swordsman [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Villa-Lobos Ram\u00edrez|Ram\u00edrez]] (Connery), who explains they and others were born immortal, invincible unless beheaded. Immortals wage a secret war, fighting each other until the last few remaining will meet at the Gathering to fight for the Prize. In 1985, the Gathering is finally happening in [[New York City]] and MacLeod must make sure the Prize is not won by his oldest enemy, the murderous [[The Kurgan|Kurgan]] (Brown).\n\n''Highlander'' enjoyed little success on its initial theatrical release, grossing over $12 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million, and received mixed reviews. Nevertheless, it became a [[cult film]] and inspired several film sequels and [[Highlander: The Series|television spin-offs]]. It is also known for songs recorded by the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], with \"[[Princes of the Universe]]\" also used for the title sequence in the television series.<ref name=35yearsAfter>{{cite news |title=Highlander: 35 years since Scotland stole the show in cult film starring Queen, Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert |url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/nostalgia/2671966/how-aberdeens-queen-of-voice-coaches-worked-a-kind-of-magic-on-cult-classic-highlander/ |access-date=November 25, 2020 |newspaper=[[The Press and Journal (Scotland)|Press and Journal]] |archive-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124110625/https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/nostalgia/2671966/how-aberdeens-queen-of-voice-coaches-worked-a-kind-of-magic-on-cult-classic-highlander/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Title sequence\"/> The tagline, \"There can be only one\", has carried on into pop culture.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1985, Connor MacLeod is confronted by an old enemy, Iman Fasil, in the parking garage of [[Madison Square Garden]]. After a sword duel, MacLeod beheads Fasil and triggers a powerful energy release\u2014known as a [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]]\u2014that affects the immediate surroundings, destroying many cars. After Connor hides his [[katana]] in the garage's ceiling, [[NYPD]] officers detain him for murder but later release him due to lack of evidence.\n\nConnor's history is revealed through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. Living in the [[Scottish Highlands]] in 1536, eighteen-year-old Connor is about to fight his first battle as the MacLeod [[Scottish clan|Clan]] is at war with the [[Clan Fraser of Lovat|Fraser Clan]]. The Frasers are aided by a mysterious warrior, [[the Kurgan]], in exchange for his right to slay Connor. In the battle, the Kurgan fatally wounds Connor but is driven off before he can decapitate him. Inexplicably, Connor makes a complete recovery, compelling his lover Kate and his cousin Dougal to accuse him of witchcraft. The clan wishes to kill him, but his other cousin, chieftain Angus, mercifully, exiles him. Connor wanders the highlands, becomes a [[blacksmith]] and marries a woman named Heather MacDonald.\n\nIn 1541, [[Juan S\u00e1nchez-Villalobos Ram\u00edrez]], a 2,437-year-old swordsman originally from [[Egypt]], finds Connor after tracking his old foe, the Kurgan, to Scotland. He explains that he, Connor, the Kurgan and others like them were [[Immortal (Highlander)|born immortals]] and are destined to battle each other, save on [[Sacred site|holy ground]]. Under the overriding belief of all immortals (\"In the end, there can be only one\"), the few who shall be left will be drawn to [[United States|a faraway land]] for the Gathering, the final battle for the Prize, the power of all the immortals through time. Ram\u00edrez reveals that immortals cannot have children and believes they must ensure evil people like the Kurgan do not win the Prize, or else humanity will suffer an eternity of darkness.\n\nRam\u00edrez trains MacLeod, and the two become friends. One night, while Connor is away, the Kurgan finds his home and duels Ram\u00edrez. Ramirez initially gets the upper hand, but Kurgan ultimately decapitates Ramirez, [[rape]]s Heather (who never tells Connor about this) and leaves the area. Years later, Heather dies of old age, prompting Connor to wander the Earth, adopting Ram\u00edrez's katana as his own after using his old sword as Heather's grave marker.\n\nIn 1985, the time of the Gathering approaches, and the Kurgan is compelled to come to New York, where Connor now lives as an antique dealer under the [[Pseudonym|alias]] \"Russell Nash,\" working with his confidant and adopted daughter [[List of Highlander characters#Major characters|Rachel Ellenstein]], whom Connor saved from the [[Nazis]] during the [[Second World War]]. Brenda Wyatt, a metallurgy expert working for the police as a forensic scientist, finds shards of Connor's sword at Fasil's murder scene and is puzzled they come from a Japanese sword dated around 600 B.C. but made with [[Japanese swordsmithing|medieval-era methods]]. Brenda witnesses the Kurgan attack Connor before police arrive, forcing them to flee. She meets with Connor twice afterward, hoping to learn about the paradoxical sword. Connor likes her, but tells her to leave him alone.\n\nConnor briefly reunites with fellow Immortal and friend Sunda Kastagir, with whom he reminisces about old times; after they part ways, the Kurgan duels and beheads Kastagir. However, the Kurgan leaves a witness behind who describes him as the killer, concentrating the NYPD's search on him. Brenda investigates Connor and finds evidence that he has lived for centuries, including faking his death every so often, living at the same address for nearly three hundred years and seeing that all his past identities (the 'son' of the previous pseudonym) have the same handwriting. On Heather's birthday, Connor lights a candle for her in a [[Catholic Church|church]], as he has done every year. The Kurgan arrives and confirms that he and Connor are now the last remaining Immortals, and also reveals that he raped Heather. Disgusted, but prohibited from fighting on holy ground, Connor leaves.\n\nBrenda confronts Connor, who explains his true identity. After spending the night together, they part company on account of Connor's immortality, but the Kurgan finds out about their newfound intimacy and kidnaps Brenda to draw Connor out. Connor decides it is time to leave behind the Russell Nash identity whatever the outcome of the fight, says goodbye to Rachel and confronts the Kurgan at [[Silvercup Studios]] in [[Queens]], rescuing Brenda in the process. After a long duel, Connor outfights and decapitates the Kurgan, absorbing his massive power and winning the Prize. Connor returns to Scotland with Brenda and reveals that he is now a mortal man who can age and have children. He is also now able to read the thoughts and feelings of people all around the world, and remembering Ramirez's lessons, he hopes to encourage cooperation, understanding, and peace among humanity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Connor MacLeod]], a 16th-century immortal born in Glenfinnan, Scotland near the shores of [[Loch Shiel]].

After reading the script, Widen's instructor advised him to send it to an agent. Widen sold the script for US$200,000. It became the first draft of what would eventually be the screenplay for the film.<ref name=\"TelegraphLiveForever\" />\n\nAccording to Widen, \"The idea of the story was basically a combination of a riff on ''[[The Duellists]]''  \u2013  guy wants to finish a duel over years\u2013  and a visit I made both to Scotland and the Tower of London armour display, where I thought, 'What if you owned all this? What if you'd worn it all through history and were giving someone a tour of your life through it?' That scene is basically in the movie.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphLiveForever\" />\n\nAccording to [[Bill Panzer|William Panzer]], producer of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', \"And that's where everything fell into place \u2014 the idea that there are Immortals and they were in conflict with each other, leading secret lives that the rest of us are unaware of.\"<ref>Bill Panzer, at [http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/interviews/highlandertv/panzerinterview.html Thedigitalbits.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814092159/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/interviews/highlandertv/panzerinterview.html|date=2007-08-14}}, last accessed September 4, 2007</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 interview with The Action Elite, Gregory Widen remarked, \"I've always been amazed that a project I wrote as a UCLA student has had this kind of life. I think its appeal is the uniqueness of how the story was told and the fact it had a heart and a point of view about immortality.\"<ref>The Action Elite \u2013 [https://theactionelite.com/interview-with-gregory-widen/ Interview with Gregory Widen](2016). {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128183122/https://theactionelite.com/interview-with-gregory-widen/ |date=November 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWiden's original draft of the script differed significantly from the film. The initial story was darker and more violent. Connor is born in 1408 rather than 1518. He lives with his mother and father and a younger brother. Heather does not exist; Connor is promised to a girl named Mara, who rejects him when she learns that he is immortal. Connor willingly leaves his village after his clan's attitude towards him changes, instead of being banished. His alias is Richard Taupin and his weapon is a custom [[broadsword]]. Ram\u00edrez is a Spaniard born in 1100, instead of an ancient Egyptian born more than two thousand years earlier. The Kurgan is known as the Knight, using the alias Carl William Smith. He is not a savage, but a cold-blooded killer. Brenda is Brenna Cartwright, a historian at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] who sometimes helps the police.\n\nOther elements were changed during the rewrite. Initially, immortals could have children; in the draft Connor is said to have had 37. In a flashback in the first draft, Connor attends the funeral of one of his sons. His wife (in her 70s) and his two sons, who are in their mid 50s, see him revealed as an immortal. In the early draft, there is no release of energy when an immortal kills another nor is there any mention of the Prize. Immortals can still sense each other and when Connor finally kills the Knight, he feels a sharp burning pain. As he senses another immortal nearby, the ending implies this is simply one of many battles as the Game continues.\n\nDirector [[Russell Mulcahy]] was flipping through a magazine and saw a photograph of [[Christopher Lambert]] from his recent role as the title hero of ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]''. At the Neuch\u00e2tel International Fantastic Film Festival in 2015, Mulcahy said he showed the photo to his production staff and \"I said, 'who's this?' They had no idea. He couldn't speak English. But he had the perfect look. And he learned English very fast.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphLiveForever\" /> Mulcahy originally considered [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Marc Singer]] for the role of Connor MacLeod.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66939/15-immortal-facts-about-highlander|title = 15 Immortal Facts About 'Highlander'|date = August 8, 2015|access-date = October 11, 2021|archive-date = October 3, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211003132414/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66939/15-immortal-facts-about-highlander|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nWiden had originally envisioned Connor as a very serious, grim character following centuries of violence and loss. The film portrayed MacLeod as a person who has suffered loss and fears new attachment but doesn't deny the possibility of love, maintains a sense of humor about life, and tells his adopted daughter to have hope and remain optimistic. In a 2016 interview with HeyUGuys, Lambert said part of what he found appealing about Connor MacLeod was the man still having humor and hope despite his long life and many losses. \"It's the only role that I have played that is touching on the subject of immortality, through a character carrying five hundred years of violence, pain, love, and suffering on his shoulders, who is still walking around and being positive. That is what amazed me about him the most...it's difficult living through one life but to see all the people around you dying over and over. How do you cope with that pain? How do you have the strength to keep on walking, to keep being positive and optimistic? To be capable of falling in love again when you know the pain it creates when you lose them.\"<ref>HeyUGuys \u2013 [https://www.heyuguys.com/exclusive-christopher-lambert-30-years-highlander/ \"Exclusive: Christopher Lambert on 30 Years of Highlander\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710001524/https://www.heyuguys.com/exclusive-christopher-lambert-30-years-highlander/ |date=July 10, 2016 }} (2016).</ref>\n\nWiden also had a different vision of the Kurgan originally. \"Kurgan was the thing that was most different about my screenplay. He was much more tortured. The Kurgan in ''Highlander'' as it is pretty much like Freddy [Krueger] \u2013 he's just a cackling psychopath. I envisaged him as a guy who loses everything over time. The only thing he could hold onto, to give him a reason to get up in the morning, was to finish this thing \u2013 finish it with our guy [MacLeod]. It was more about that\u2026it was just a reason to get up in the morning. Otherwise, what is the point? Everything is impermanent, everything is lost. That made him much more serious \u2013 in a weird way, a sympathetic bad guy.\" Widen commented that actor [[Clancy Brown]] had similar thoughts about the Kurgan, wishing to make him more complex and interesting by dressing the villain in a bowler hat and suit, disguising his villainy rather than wearing the biker outfit he had instead.<ref name=\"TelegraphLiveForever\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Eilean Donan Castle Panorama.jpg|thumb|600px|Scotland's [[Eilean Donan Castle]] and its bridge featured prominently in the film]]\nThe budget was put up by Thorn EMI.<ref name=\"yule\" /> When brought to Russell Mulcahy, the title was ''The Dark Knight''.<ref name=Guardian-2016-07-05>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/05/highlander-how-we-made-sean-connery-christopher-lambert-russell-mulcahy-interview |author= Phil Hoad |date= July 5, 2016 |title= How we made Highlander: 'Connery opened his homemade whisky on the plane' |work= The Guardian |access-date= August 8, 2017 |archive-date= August 8, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170808153142/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/05/highlander-how-we-made-sean-connery-christopher-lambert-russell-mulcahy-interview |url-status= live }}</ref> [[Principal photography|Filming]] took place in Scotland, England, and New York City.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\" />\n\nDirector Russell Mulcahy filmed ''Highlander'' using music video techniques including [[fast cutting]] and pacy music.<ref>{{cite news |title=Running on MTV |date=August 8, 1991 |work=Straits Times |location=Singapore  |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings Limited}}</ref>\n\nIn preparation, actor Christopher Lambert spent months working four hours each morning with a dialect coach and four hours in the afternoons sword training with [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]], who had been a [[Darth Vader]] stunt double in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.<ref name=\":1\">Guardian \u2013 [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/05/highlander-how-we-made-sean-connery-christopher-lambert-russell-mulcahy-interview \"How we made ''Highlander'': Connery opened his homemade whiskey on the plane\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808153142/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/05/highlander-how-we-made-sean-connery-christopher-lambert-russell-mulcahy-interview |date=August 8, 2017 }} (2016).</ref>\n\nOn filming a scene underwater in a Scottish [[loch]], Lambert said, \"The first time it's a surprise.

Both movies received negative reviews from fans of both the original film and the TV show.

Lambert turned down the role, so the series became a spin-off, introducing a new character Duncan MacLeod played by [[Adrian Paul]]. ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' began airing on television in 1992, with Lambert appearing as Connor in the first episode. The series explains Duncan is a man born decades after Connor's banishment and adopted by the Clan MacLeod. After Duncan discovers he is immortal, Connor finds him and trains him before going his separate way. The season two premiere episode \"The Watchers\" confirms Connor's battle with the Kurgan still happened in 1985 in the canon of the show, but the Prize was not won because there were still several living immortals in this version of events, including Duncan. Lambert did not appear in any other episode, but he and Duncan meet again in the movie ''Highlander: Endgame''.\n\n''[[Highlander: The Animated Series]]'' aired 1994 to 1996. A loose science fiction adaptation and sequel of the original film, the series imagines a meteorite causing an apocalypse on Earth. In the wake of this, Connor MacLeod is one of several immortals who decides to help preserve knowledge for humanity rather than continue their war for the Prize, though he is then killed by Kortan, the one remaining evil immortal. Taking place in the 27th century, the series features the young immortal hero Quentin MacLeod, last descendant of the MacLeod Clan. He is trained by another immortal named Don Vincente Marino Ramirez, an old friend of Connor's.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Highlander (film)}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0091203|Highlander}}\n* {{mojo title|highlander|Highlander}}\n\n{{Highlander}}\n{{Russell Mulcahy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:British action adventure films]]\n[[Category:British fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:EMI Films films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films about duels]]\n[[Category:British films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Films set in Spain]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1530s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1780s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1985]]\n[[Category:Films shot in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Highland (council area)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Spain]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Russell Mulcahy]]\n[[Category:Films produced by William N.
