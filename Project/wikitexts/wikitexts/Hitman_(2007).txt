The story revolves around [[Agent 47]], a professional [[hitman]], who was engineered to be an assassin by the group known as \"ICA\" (International Contract Agency). He becomes ensnared in a political conspiracy and finds himself pursued by both Interpol and the Russian version of the [[FBI]]. The film stars [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]]. It was released on November 21, 2007 in the United States; November 30, 2007 in the United Kingdom; and December 26, 2007, in France. Though critically not well received, it was a financial success, grossing $101.3 million against a $24 million budget.\n\nA [[sequel]] was canceled during the production, but it was followed by a reboot titled ''[[Hitman: Agent 47]]'' starring [[Rupert Friend]] as Agent 47 and written again by Skip Woods, released on August 21, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nInside a heavily guarded facility, a group of young boys are given tattoos of [[bar codes]] on the backs of their shaved heads and are then trained in weapons, demolitions, unarmed combat, stamina, and strength to become globally operating [[Special forces|professionally trained]] [[hitmen]]. And during current day, [[Interpol]] agent Mike Whittier ([[Dougray Scott]]) arrives home and is met at gunpoint by [[Agent 47]]. The two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, raised and trained by a mysterious paramilitary group known simply as the [[International Contract Agency|Organization]].\n\nThree months prior, 47 ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) is completing a hit on a Nigerian warlord named Bwana Ovie, force-feeding a captured soldier with [[plastic explosive]]s and using him as a human bomb to kill Ovie. In a subsequent change of plans, 47 is told by his Organization handler, Diana Burnwood, that he is to kill his next target, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Mikhail Belicoff ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), publicly instead of privately. Agent 47 completes his mission by shooting the man in the head, but before he can leave [[Russia]], he is contacted by his superiors. He is mystified when told the hit was a failure and that Belicoff survived the attack on his life. The Organization notifies him of a witness to the assassination and orders him to intercept and kill her. However, when 47 realizes she has never seen him before, he does not shoot her; instead, he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt on himself by another Agent and realizes he is being set up.\n\nHis employers send his location and identity to the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], but Diana secretly calls 47 and tips him off, revealing that Belicoff himself had ordered the hit. After escaping from his hotel, 47 intercepts Nika ([[Olga Kurylenko]]), Belicoff's mistress and the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit. He interrogates her and discovers that Belicoff had a [[political decoy|double]], who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff in order to take his place as the president of Russia. The Organization, hoping to gain influence with the new government, ordered 47 to kill Nika and then set him up be erased, to cover their tracks.\n\nNika and 47 are attacked by more Organization agents on a train, whom 47 [[hand to hand combat|fights]] and kills. Whittier then attempts to arrest 47 himself, only to be easily overpowered. Nika persuades 47 to let Whittier go free, and Whittier is forced to leave Russia by FSB officer Yuri Marklov ([[Robert Knepper]]), who is overseeing the manhunt, for interfering. 47 contacts his associate, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Carlton Smith, to offer him a deal: 47 will kill Udre Belicoff (Mikhail's brother and a wealthy [[arms dealer]] and [[Human trafficking in Russia|human trafficker]]) in exchange for a favour. Smith informs 47 that Udre had been planning something with a German gunrunner named Price.\n\n47 and Nika travel to [[Istanbul]], where 47 abducts Price, poses as him to meet Udre at a club, and kills him, forcing Belicoff's double to attend Udre's public funeral. 47 kidnaps Marklov and forces him to order his own agents to disrupt the funeral and create a distraction while 47, disguised as a soldier, deals with the imposter's bodyguards and kills him before Whittier arrives with backup from Interpol to take him into custody. Smith delivers on his end of the deal and has his operatives intercept the convoy that is transporting 47 to the airport, allowing the hitman to escape.\n\nBack in Whittier's home, 47 suggests Whittier go along with his plan: that he notify the police that he has killed (a fake) Agent 47, implying that Whittier will not survive if he refuses, and leaves. Nika is seen picking up an envelope containing the deed to a vineyard, a dream of hers to own. Agent 47 is watching her from afar, through the scope of a sniper rifle. Looking at the corpse of another Agent lying at his feet, he muses that he had warned him (meaning the Organization) not to touch her, and then walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[Agent 47]]: An orphaned child, taken in and trained by the Organization to become a professionally trained, internationally operating [[hitman]] for hire.\n** Borislav Parvanov as Young Agent 47\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Mike Whittier: An [[Interpol]] agent who has been tracking Agent 47 for quite some time and finally confronts his mysterious target.\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as Yuri Marklov: Lead agent of an [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] force.
