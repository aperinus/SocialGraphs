It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[Jackie Chan]]'s [[Police Story (film series)|''Police Story'' film series]] involving the character Yeoh portrayed in ''[[Supercop]]''.\n\nAlthough Jackie Chan only has a [[cameo appearance]] in this film, some DVD covers prominently featured Chan, misleading audiences into thinking he is one of the main characters. He reprises his role as Inspector Chan, but in drag to catch a criminal in drag wearing the same wig and clothes.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the mission from ''[[Supercop]]'', Inspector Yang participates in neutralizing a terrorist incident during which she narrowly survives, and is awarded the Highest Distinction for the mission. Her boyfriend Chang, a war veteran who works as a security guard and bravely helped Yang in her mission, is frustrated that Yang gets a mere medal for risking her life. Growing disillusioned with the prospects in Mainland China, the ambitious Chang leaves for Hong Kong, promising to one day come back a millionaire and marry Yang.\n\nSome time later, the Hong Kong police encounters a heavily armed gang of highly trained robbers. Suspecting them to be ex-militaries from the Mainland, the police asked for assistance from the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Chinese Public Security]]. Yang is dispatched to Hong Kong to provide intelligence sharing, working with Inspector Lee, who has an awkward crush on Yang.\n\nYang helps Lee track down the robbers' safehouse. Although the robbers have rigged explosives in the building to ambush the police, Chang, who leads the gang, hesitates after seeing Yang, resulting in one of their member being killed and another arrested. In order to free the arrested man, who is a demolition specialist crucial to an upcoming heist, Chang contacts Yang and rekindles their relationship, and manages to stage a successful breakout. Yang suspects Chang's part in the crime, but cannot bring herself to accuse Chang. She is then ordered to return to Mainland, although she convinces Lee to let her stay on the case.\n\nThe robbers then perform a daring heist on the Central Bank, masterminded by Roger Davidson, the designer of the Bank's vault security. After successfully breaking into the vault, Davidson double-crosses Chang's gang. Chang survives the betrayal and chases down Davidson's crew in an [[Harbour Crossing Tunnel|underwater subway tunnel]], killing Davidson's men and mortally wounding Davidson.  Yang, who has infiltrated the bank during the heist, arrives and confronts Chang, trying to convince him to surrender.  When Chang is distracted by Yang, the dying Davidson detonates a bomb, causing the tunnel to flood. Knowing his injury will only hinder their survival, Chang pushes Yang and Lee past the lock gate, sacrificing his own life for the person he loved.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as [[Interpol]] Inspector Jessica Yang Jian-wa / Jessica Yang Cien-hua\n* [[Yu Rongguang]] (as Yu Rong Guang) as David Chang Fung, Vietnam veteran and Yang's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Wakin Chau|Emil Chau]] as [[Royal Hong Kong Police|RHKP]] Inspector Martin Lee Kwong-ming\n* [[Athena Chu]] as Annie May Lee, Lee's younger sister\n* [[Louis Fan (actor)|Louis Fan]] (as Fan Sui Wong) as Alan Kwok Shao-long, Lee's partner and May's boyfriend\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong, RHKP [[deputy commissioner]]\n* Alain Guernier as Roger Davidson, designer of the Central Bank Vault\n* [[Bowie Lam]] as George Ho Chu, Chang's right-hand man\n* [[Dick Wei]] as Ah Shuen / Chuen\n* [[Joe Cheung]] as Jewelry shop manager / Fung's Man in Hospital (2 roles)\n* Chan Mei-kei as Bank manager\n* [[Yukari Oshima]] as Red Terrorist at the Beginning \n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] as Jewelry Store Customer \n* Alien Sit as Po\n* Sam Wong as Chun\n* Bruce Law as Ping \n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Inspector \"Kevin\" Chan Ka-Kui (cameo)\n* [[Eric Tsang]] as Jewel Robbing Leader (cameo)\n* [[Jon M.
