Upset by her deteriorating marriage to unfaithful businessman Hutton Morrow, Susan becomes consumed by the novel, which is dedicated to her and named ''Nocturnal Animals'' after Edward's nickname for her.\n\nIn the novel, Tony Hastings is a family man who runs afoul of three local troublemakers \u2013 Ray Marcus, Lou and Turk \u2013 during a road trip through [[West Texas]]. After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife, Laura and their daughter, India, leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police.\n\nDetective Roberto \"Bobby\" Andes is assigned to the case and with Tony, discovers the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, where they had been raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt. He is contacted by Andes a year later and is asked to identify Lou, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders of Laura and India.\n\nTurk has been fatally shot in a botched robbery, leaving Ray as the last culprit to be brought to justice. Andes arrests Ray but is forced to release him as they have only circumstantial evidence of his involvement. On the verge of retirement and having been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Andes decides to take matters into his own hands and with Tony's help, abducts Ray and Lou. Andes shoots Lou dead when he attempts to flee but Ray escapes.\n\nTony tracks down Ray to the shack where Laura and India were killed. Ray admits to raping and murdering Tony's wife and daughter, calling him weak. Tony fatally shoots him but is blinded when Ray hits him on the head with a fire poker. Tony stumbles outside and dies after falling on his gun, shooting himself in the abdomen in the process.\n\nShocked by the dark content and raw emotion of the novel, Susan reminisces about meeting Edward in college and their blossoming relationship, which Susan's domineering mother Anne Sutton objected to, claiming that Edward was not worthy of Susan's affections and that because of his romantic world view, he lacked the drive to achieve his goals; Susan ignored her mother's objections, eventually marrying Edward.\n\nAfter finding further evidence of Hutton's extramarital affair, Susan resumes her reading of the manuscript and begins to recall her troubled marriage to Edward, which was strained by her frustration with his fledgling career and her dismissive attitude towards his literary aspirations and culminated with Susan cheating on him with Hutton and divorcing Edward to marry him. Edward attempted to repair their relationship but ultimately cut ties with Susan upon learning that she was pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion to ensure an end to any attachment with him.\n\nIn the present day, Susan finishes reading the novel and arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant. Edward does not show up and Susan waits alone as the restaurant empties.\n\n== Cast ==\n===The real world===\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Susan Morrow, a wealthy art gallery owner living in Los Angeles<ref name=\"GyllenhaalAdamsCast\" />\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Edward Sheffield, Susan's estranged ex-husband and novelist<ref name=\"GyllenhaalAdamsCast\" />\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Hutton Morrow, Susan's second husband, who has been neglectful towards Susan<ref name=\"HammerCast\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Anne Sutton, Susan's estranged mother\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Alessia Holt, Carlos' wife\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Carlos Holt, Alessia's homosexual husband\n* [[Bobbi Menuez]] (credited as India Menuez) as Samantha Morrow, Susan's daughter\n* [[Zawe Ashton]] as Alex, a receptionist\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Sage Ross, Susan\u2019s young coworker\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as Christopher, Susan\u2019s attendant\n* [[Kristin Bauer van Straten]] as Samantha Van Helsing\n\n===The novel===\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Tony Hastings, a motorist on vacation with his family who is forced off the road by Ray Marcus' gang<ref name=\"GyllenhaalAdamsCast\" />\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Detective Bobby Andes, a dedicated detective for a local police department<ref name=\"Aug2015Variety\" />\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as Ray Marcus, the sadistic leader of the gang<ref name=\"Aug2015Variety\" />\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Laura Hastings, Tony's wife, who is kidnapped by Ray Marcus' gang<ref name=\"FisherCast\" />\n* [[Ellie Bamber]] as India Hastings, Tony's daughter, who is also kidnapped alongside her mother<ref name=\"BamberCast\" />\n* [[Karl Glusman]] as Lou Bates, gang member<ref name=\"GlusmanCast\" />\n* [[Robert Aramayo]] as Steve \"Turk\" Adams, gang member<ref name=\"AramayoCast\" />\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Lieutenant Graves\n\n==Production==\nOn March 24, 2015, it was announced that [[Smokehouse Pictures]]' partners [[George Clooney]] and [[Grant Heslov]] would produce a thriller, ''Nocturnal Animals'', based on [[Austin Wright]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Tony and Susan]]''.<ref name=NocturnalAnimals>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Tom Ford Teams With George Clooney for Thriller 'Nocturnal Animals' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-ford-teams-george-clooney-783758|access-date=March 30, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109103838/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-ford-teams-george-clooney-783758|archive-date=9 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Tom Ford]] was set to direct the film, based on his own script.<ref name=\"NocturnalAnimals\" /> Ford said that the storytelling concept of the novel appealed to him, explaining, \"The film is very different than the book it's based on.
