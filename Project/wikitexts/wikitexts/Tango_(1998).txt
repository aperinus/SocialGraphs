It was photographed by cinematographer [[Vittorio Storaro]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn [[Buenos Aires]], Mario Su\u00e1rez, a middle-aged theatre director, is left holed up in his apartment, licking his wounds when his girlfriend (and principal dancer) Laura leaves him. Seeking distraction, he throws himself into his next project, a musical about the tango. One evening, while meeting with his backers, he is introduced to a beautiful young woman, Elena, the girlfriend of his chief investor Angelo, a shady businessman with [[Underworld (criminal)|underworld]] connections.\n\nAngelo asks Mario to audition Elena. He does so and is immediately captivated by her. Eventually, he takes her out of the chorus and gives her a leading role. An affair develops between them, but the possessive Angelo has her followed, and threatens her with dire consequences if she leaves him, mirroring Mario's own feelings and actions towards Laura before Elena entered his life.\n\nThe investors are unhappy with some of Mario's dance sequences. They don't like a routine which criticises the violent military repression and torture of the past. Angelo has been given a small part, which he takes very seriously. The lines between fact and fiction begin to blur: during a scene in the musical showing immigrants newly arrived in Argentina, two men fight over the character played by Elena. She is stabbed. Only slowly do we realise that her death is not for real.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1]] as Mario Su\u00e1rez\n* [[M\u00eda Maestro]] as Elena Flores\n* [[Cecilia Narova]] as Laura Fuentes\n* [[Juan Luis Galiardo]] as Angelo Larroca\n* [[Juan Carlos Copes]] as Carlos Nebbia\n* [[Carlos Rivarola]] as Ernesto Landi\n* [[Sandra Ballesteros]] as Mar\u00eda Elman\n* [[\u00d3scar Cardozo Ocampo]] as Daniel Stein\n* [[Enrique Pinti]] as Sergio Lieman\n* [[Julio Bocca]] as Julio Bocca\n* [[Mart\u00edn Seefeld]] as Andr\u00e9s Castro\n\n==Production==\nTango was shown out of competition at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4917/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Tango |access-date=11 August 2013|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n'''Wins'''\n* 1998 - [[Goya Award]] for Best Sound.\n* 1998 - Grand Prix Technique de la CST (Vittorio Storaro) at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\" />\n* 1998 - [[San Diego Film Critics Society Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Film\n\n'''Nominations'''\n* 1998 - [[Academy Award]] Best Foreign Language Film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.<ref name=\"Oscars1999\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1999 |title=The 71st Academy Awards (1999) Nominees and Winners |access-date=20 October 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n* 1998 - [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n==Home media==\n''Tango''  was issued on DVD by [[Sony Pictures]] in August 1999, in Spanish with English subtitles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 71st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Argentine submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0120274}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1084081_tango}}\n* {{Allmovie title|162521}}\n* [http://www.cinenacional.com/node/2361/casting#sinopsis  ''Tango''] at the [[cinenacional.com]] {{in lang|es}}\n\n{{Carlos Saura}}\n{{San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{Argentine submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tango}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Carlos Saura]]\n[[Category:1990s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Tango films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Buenos Aires]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin]]\n[[Category:1990s dance films]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Argentine musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish musical drama films]]"}]}}}}
