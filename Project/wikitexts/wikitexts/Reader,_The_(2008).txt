It stars [[Kate Winslet]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], and [[David Kross]]. It was the last film for producers [[Anthony Minghella]] and [[Sydney Pollack]], both of whom died prior to its release.  Production began in [[Germany]] in September 2007, and the film opened in limited release on December 10, 2008.\n\nThe film tells the story of Michael Berg, a German lawyer who, as a 15-year-old in 1958, has a sexual relationship with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz. She disappears only to resurface years later as one of the defendants in a [[war crime]]s trial stemming from her actions as a guard at a [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]. Michael realizes that Hanna is keeping a personal secret she believes is worse than her Nazi past&nbsp;\u2013 a secret which, if revealed, could help her at the trial. Some historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of the audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of [[Holocaust revisionism]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Tim |last = Shipman |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/4624573/Kate-Winslets-Oscar-chances-hit-by-The-Reader-Nazi-accusation.html |title = Kate Winslet's Oscar chances hit by The Reader Nazi accusation |work = The Daily Telegraph |date = 15 February 2009 |access-date = 8 November 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160814101831/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/4624573/Kate-Winslets-Oscar-chances-hit-by-The-Reader-Nazi-accusation.html |archive-date = 14 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough it received mixed reviews, Winslet and Kross, who plays the young Michael, received acclaim for their performances; Winslet won a number of awards for her role, including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. The film was nominated for several other major awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1995 [[Berlin]], Michael Berg watches a train pass, flashing back to a [[tram]] ride from 1958. Michael, 15, feels sick, getting off the tram to walk in the rain. Vomiting beside an apartment building, tram conductor Hanna Schmitz, 36, finds him, cleans him up and helps him home. Michael is diagnosed with [[scarlet fever]].\n\nMichael visits Hanna with flowers once he is better, and they proceed to have a summer affair. She asks him to read to her from his school books. On a bicycle trip, they visit a church with a choir and Hanna is emotional. Toward the end of summer, Hanna is promoted to the tram's head offices, they argue, she sends him away, packs her things and leaves. When Michael finds her apartment vacant he is devastated.\n\nAgain in 1995, Michael is reserved around women, divorced, and estranged from his daughter.\n\nIn 1966, a [[Heidelberg University]] [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Law School]] student, Michael observes a trial (similar to the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]]) of several former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards accused of letting 300 Jewish women and children perish in a burning church during the [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] near [[Krakow]], Poland. Michael is horrified to see that Hanna is one of the defendants. Ilana Mather and her mother Rose give the key evidence. Ilana testifies that Hanna had women from the camp read to her in the evenings. Rose testifies that when the church caught fire from a bombing raid, as the guards locked the doors, all but her and Ilana died.\n\nHanna, unlike her co-defendants, admits that Auschwitz was an [[extermination camp]] and that she and the others chose 10 women for each month's ''[[Glossary of Nazi Germany#S|Selektion]]''. When questioned on the church fire, no one explained why they had not unlocked the doors. The guards' report said they did not know about it until morning. Hanna admitted it was a lie, they had not opened the doors so the prisoners could not escape. \n\nHanna's co-defendants then all lie that she was in charge, and that she wrote the report. Hanna denies this, insisting that all the guards present agreed on the contents of the report. The lead judge asks for a handwriting sample, ashamed, she avoids this test by testifying she wrote the report. Watching the trial from the public gallery, Michael realizes Hanna's secret: she is illiterate, and so she could not have read or written it.\n\nWhen Michael tells his law professor, he tells him his moral obligation is to inform the court. The professor is frustrated with him for not having spoken to Hanna, so he tries to visit her in prison, but cannot face her and leaves her waiting. She gets a life sentence for 300 murder cases, while the other defendants are sentenced to four years and three months each for aiding and abetting. Michael weeps from the gallery.\n\nYears later, Michael puts the books he had read to Hanna on tape. She borrows the books from the prison library, teaching herself to read and write using Michael's voice. She writes to Michael, gradually with more and more literacy, but he never responds.\n\nIn 1988, a prison official contacts Michael, requesting his help with Hanna's transition into society following her release. Initially refusing, he later visits to say he has found her a place and a job. Pleased to see him, she tries to reconnect, but Michael is distant. He asks if she thinks about the past and Hanna asks if he means their past. When he says he means the war. She says what she feels and thinks does not matter as, \"The dead are still dead.\" Both are left upset.\n\nMichael arrives at the prison with flowers on Hanna's release day, but is told she has hanged herself. She left a crude will, gifting a tea tin with cash and the money in her bank account to Ilana.\n\nMichael finds Ilana in [[New York City|NYC]], admitting his connection to Hanna and its long-lasting impact. Telling her about Hanna's illiteracy, she tells him to seek catharsis elsewhere. Michael tells her what she left her, showing her the tea tin, but Ilana refuses the money. He suggests it be donated to a Jewish literacy organization in Hanna's name, and Ilana agrees he should do it if he wishes. She keeps the tin, as it is like one she once had.\n\nThe film ends in 1995 with Michael driving his daughter Julia to Hanna's grave, telling her their story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Hanna Schmitz\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the older Michael Berg\n* [[David Kross]] as the younger Michael Berg\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Professor Rohl, a Holocaust survivor\n* [[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as Ilana Mather, a concentration camp survivor\n* [[Lena Olin]] as Rose Mather (Ilana's mother), and as the older Ilana Mather\n* [[Vijessna Ferkic]] as Sophie, Michael's friend at school\n* [[Karoline Herfurth]] as Marthe, Michael's friend at university  \n* [[Burghart Klau\u00dfner]] as the judge at Hanna's trial\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Mrs. Brenner, prison official\n* [[Hannah Herzsprung]] as Julia, Michael Berg's daughter in 1995\n* [[Jeanette Hain]] as Brigitte, Michael's girlfriend in 1995\n* [[Susanne Lothar]] as Carla Berg, Michael's mother\n* [[Matthias Habich]] as Peter Berg, Michael's father\n* {{ILL|Florian Bartholom\u00e4i|de}} as Thomas Berg, Michael's brother\n* Alissa Wilms as Emily Berg, Michael's sister\n* [[Sylvester Groth]] as the prosecutor at Hanna's trial\n* [[Fabian Busch]] as the defense lawyer at Hanna's trial\n* [[Volker Bruch]] as Dieter Spenz, a student in the seminar group\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn April 1998 [[Miramax Films]] acquired the rights to the novel ''[[The Reader]]'',<ref>{{cite news| first=Monica| last=Roman| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117469993.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| title=Miramax books 'Reader'| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=April 22, 1998| access-date=2007-12-28}}</ref> and principal photography began in September 2007 immediately after [[Stephen Daldry]] was signed to direct the film adaptation and Fiennes was cast in a lead role.<ref name=gig>{{cite news| first=Michael| last=Fleming| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970451.html?categoryid=10&cs=1| title=Kidman, Fiennes book 'Reader' gig| newspaper=Variety| date=August 17, 2007| access-date=2007-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| first=Christian| last=Koehl| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972002.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| title=Senator inks rights to 'Reader'| newspaper=Variety| date=September 14, 2007| access-date=2007-12-28}}</ref>  Winslet was originally cast as Hanna, but scheduling difficulties with [[Revolutionary Road (film)|''Revolutionary Road'']] led her to leave the film and [[Nicole Kidman]] was cast as her replacement.<ref name=\"Kaminer\" /> In January 2008, Kidman left the project, citing her recent pregnancy as the primary reason.

In the episode, Winslet decided to increase her chance of winning an Oscar by starring in a film about the Holocaust, noting that such films were [[Oscar bait|often awarded Oscars]].<ref>{{cite web| last1=Grabert| first1=Jessica| title=Extras' Best Episode: Kate Winslet| url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Extras-Best-Episode-Kate-Winslet-39075.html| website=Cinema Blend| date=January 30, 2012| access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref> However, in the fictional film, Winslet played a nun sheltering children from the Holocaust rather than one of its perpetrators. Winslet commented that the similarity \"would be funny\", but the connection didn't occur to her until \"midway through shooting the film...this was never a Holocaust movie to me. That's part of the story and provides something of a backdrop, and sets the scene. But to me it was always an extraordinarily unconventional love story.\"<ref>{{cite web| last1=Rich| first1=Katey| title=Kate Winslet interview| url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Kate-Winslet-11197.html| website=Cinema Blend| date=December 10, 2008| access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
