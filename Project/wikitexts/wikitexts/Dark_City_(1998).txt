The screenplay was written by Proyas, [[Lem Dobbs]], and [[David S. Goyer]]. In the film, Sewell plays an [[amnesia]]c man who, finding himself suspected of murder, attempts to discover his true identity and clear his name while on the run from the police and a mysterious group known as the \"Strangers\".<ref>{{cite journal | last=Helms | first=Michael | date=May 1998 | title=Dark City: Interview with Andrew Mason and Alex Proyas | journal=[[Cinema Papers]] | publisher=Cinema Papers Pty Ltd. | location=North Melbourne | issue=124 | pages=18\u201321 | issn=0311-3639 | language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrimarily shot at [[Fox Studios Australia]], the film was jointly produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and Proyas' production company Mystery Clock Cinema, and distributed by the former for theatrical release.

When a [[director's cut]] of the film was released in 2008, among the changes was the removal of the opening narration.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Murdoch awakens in a hotel bathtub, suffering from amnesia. He receives a phone call from Dr Daniel Schreber, who urges him to flee the hotel to evade a group of men who are after him. In the room, Murdoch discovers the corpse of a ritualistically murdered woman along with a bloody knife. He flees the scene, just as a group of pale men in trenchcoats (later identified as members of \"the Strangers\") arrive.\n\nPolice Inspector Frank Bumstead is looking for Murdoch as a suspect in a series of murdered prostitutes, though Murdoch cannot remember killing anybody. Following clues, Murdoch learns his own name and finds out he has a wife named Emma. When the Strangers catch up with him, he shows he has the ability to [[psychokinesis|alter reality at will]], which the Strangers can also do and refer to as \"tuning\", and he manages to use these powers to escape.\n\nMurdoch wanders the streets of the anachronistic city,<ref>Proyas, Alex (Director) (2008). ''Dark City'', Director's Cut: at approximately 1:08, Mr Hand states that the city is a mix of eras. (Blu-Ray disc)</ref> where nobody seems to notice the perpetual nighttime. At midnight, he watches as everyone else falls asleep and the Strangers physically rearrange the city and, assisted by Schreber, change the inhabitant's identities and memories. He learns that he came from a coastal town called Shell Beach, which is familiar to everyone, though nobody knows how to get there, and all of his attempts to visit are unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the Strangers inject one of their men, Mr Hand, with a copy of the memories given to Murdoch, hoping it will help them predict his movements and track him down.\n\nInspector Bumstead eventually catches Murdoch, though he acknowledges that Murdoch is most likely innocent, as by then he has his own misgivings about the nature of the city. They confront Schreber, who explains that the Strangers, which are [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]] who use human corpses as their hosts, have a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], and are experimenting with humans to analyze individuality in hopes of making a discovery that will help their race survive. Schreber also reveals that Murdoch is an anomaly who inadvertently awoke when Schreber was in the middle of imprinting his latest identity as a murderer.\n\nMurdoch and Bumstead take Schreber and attempt to reach Shell Beach, but instead end up at a poster for the town on a wall at the edge of the city. Frustrated, Murdoch and Bumstead break through the wall, revealing outer space, just before some of the Strangers, including Mr Hand, arrive with Emma as a hostage. In the ensuing fight, Bumstead and one of the Strangers fall through the hole and drift out into space, and the city is shown to be a deep space habitat surrounded by a force field.\n\nThe Strangers bring Murdoch to their home beneath the city and force Schreber to imprint Murdoch with their collective memory, believing Murdoch to be the culmination of their experiments. Schreber betrays them, however, and instead inserts false memories in Murdoch that artificially reestablish his childhood as years spent training and honing his tuning skills and learning about the Strangers and their machines. Murdoch awakens and, now able to fully realize his powers, frees himself and battles with the Strangers, defeating their leader Mr Book in a psychokinetic fight high above the city.\n\nAfter learning from Schreber that Emma has been re-imprinted and cannot be restored, Murdoch employs his powers, amplified by the Strangers' machine, to create an actual Shell Beach by flooding the area within the force field with water and forming a [[Spit (landform)|spit]] and beaches. On his way home, Murdoch encounters a dying Mr Hand and informs him that the Strangers searched in the wrong place\u2014the mind\u2014to understand humanity. He rotates the habitat toward the star it had been turned away from, and the city experiences sunlight for the first time.\n\nOpening a door leading out of the city, Murdoch steps out to view the sunrise. On the pier in front of him is the woman he knew as Emma, who now has new memories and a new identity as Anna. Murdoch reintroduces himself and they walk to Shell Beach, beginning their relationship anew.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- In the same order as the scrolling end credits -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as John Murdoch\n* [[William Hurt]] as Inspector Frank Bumstead\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Dr Daniel P.

He can't put the facts together because they don't add up to anything rational.\"<ref name=\"wagner1997a7\">{{Harvnb|Wagner|1997a|p=7}}</ref> In the process of creating the fictional world for the character of the detective, Proyas created other characters, and ended up shifting the focus of the film from the detective (Bumstead) to the person pursued by the detective (Murdoch). Proyas envisioned a robust narrative where the audience could examine the film from the perspective of multiple characters and focus on the plot.<ref name=\"wagner1998a40\" />\n\nAfter writing the first draft of the screenplay by himself, Proyas worked with [[Lem Dobbs]] and [[David S. Goyer]] to create the final script. Goyer had written ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996), the sequel to Proyas's 1994 film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', and Proyas invited Goyer to co-write ''Dark City'' after reading Goyer's screenplay for ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'', which had yet to be released. The [[Writers Guild of America]] initially protested the crediting of more than two screenwriters for a film, but eventually relented and credited all three writers.<ref name=\"wagner1997b67\">{{Harvnb|Wagner|1997b|p=67}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nWhen Proyas finished his preceding film, ''The Crow'', in 1994, he approached production designer [[Patrick Tatopoulos]] to draw concepts for the world in which ''Dark City'' takes place.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagner|1997b|p=64}}</ref> The city was entirely constructed on a set, and no practical locations were used in the film.<ref name=\"wagner1997a7\" /> Describing the city, Tatopoulos said:\n\n<blockquote>The movie takes place everywhere, and it takes place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't really know where you are. A piece will look like a street in London, but a portion of the architecture looks like New York, but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city. You're there, but you don't know where you are. It's like every time you travel, you'll be lost.<ref name=\"wagner1997b65\">{{Harvnb|Wagner|1997b|p=65}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe production design included themes of darkness, spirals, and clocks. There appears to be no sun in the city's world, and spiral designs that shrink when approached were used. The Strangers' large clock does not have any numbers, and Tatopoulos said: \"But in a magical moment it becomes something more than just a clock.\"<ref name=\"wagner1997b65\" /> The production designer created the city architecture to have an organic presence alongside the structural elements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagner|1997b|p=66}}</ref>\n\nThe Strangers' lair is a large underground amphitheater, in which a sculpture of a human face hides a large clock and a spiraling device changes the layout of the city above. The set for the lair was {{Convert|50|ft|spell=in}} in height, while an average set is {{Convert|36|ft|spell=in}}, and was built on a fairground in Sydney, Australia. The film's budget was $30\u201340 million,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagner|1998b|p=33}}</ref> so the crew used inexpensive techniques to build the set, such as stretching canvas onto welded metal frames. The lair also had a rail conveyance that appeared expensive. Tatopoulos said: \"We had, obviously, a car built, but we had just one built. We laid some rail for it to ride on. We made a section of corridor that we kept driving through all the time, and you end up believing this thing is running along forever.\" Proyas wanted the rail car to pass various rooms, which was not feasible given the budget, so Tatopoulos and the crew used \"replaceable elements and strong design textures\" to give the impression it was passing different rooms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagner|1998b|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThe Strangers themselves are energy beings who reside in dead human bodies. At the beginning of the design process, the filmmakers considered having the Strangers be bugs, but they decided the bug appearance was overused. Tatopoulos said one day Proyas \"called me and said he wanted something like an energy that kept re-powering itself, re-creating itself, re-shaping itself, sitting inside a dry piece of human shape.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagner|1998b|p=32}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAbout the character of Mr Hand, Proyas said: \"I had Richard in mind physically when I wrote the character, because I had these strange, bald-looking men with an ethereal, androgynous quality\", and O'Brien had famously played a similar character (Riff Raff) in ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''. When Proyas visited London to cast the film, he met with O'Brien and found him suitable for the role.<ref name=\"wagner1997a9\" />\n\nDaniel P. Schreber, the character portrayed by [[Kiefer Sutherland]], was named after [[Daniel Paul Schreber]], a German judge with narcissistic, paranoid [[psychosis]], and possibly [[schizophrenia]], whose autobiographical ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness'' (''Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken'') (1903) inspired some elements of the film's plot.<ref>Kemble, Gary (2009).

For me the question is, if there was a man and a woman who were in love who were married let's say, and who had been together for a very long time, if by some strange procedure they could have their memories erased, and then they would re-meet, would they fall in love again? Is love some kind of a force that rules us beyond our identification with each other and ourselves?  My feeling is that's probably the case.  I don't think any scientist has fully resolved why two people amongst the many millions of people in the world and the many thousands they might meet, why you find a partner and have this bond with a particular person.  So my belief is that it is a very fundamental aspect of the way we function as human beings and that perhaps it's something that rules us, that drugs us in ways we can't explain or understand.}}</ref>}}\n\nTheologian [[Gerard Loughlin]] interpreted ''Dark City'' as a retelling of [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]]. For Loughlin, the city dwellers are prisoners who do not realize they are in a prison. John Murdoch's escape from the prison parallels the escape from the cave in the allegory. He is assisted by Dr. Schreber, who explains the city's mechanism as Socrates explains to Glaucon how the shadows in the cave are cast. Murdoch, however, becomes more than Glaucon: \"He is a Glaucon who comes to realize that Socrates' tale of an upper, more real world, is itself a shadow, a forgery.\"<ref name=\"loughlin\">{{Citation | last=Loughlin|first=Gerard|title=Alien Sex: The Body and Desire in Cinema and Theology | chapter=Seeing in the Dark |date=February 2004 | publisher=Wiley\u2013Blackwell | isbn=0-631-21180-2 | pages=46\u201348 }}</ref> Murdoch defeats the Strangers, who control the inhabitants, and remakes the world based on childhood memories, which were themselves illusions arranged by the Strangers. He casts new shadows for the city inhabitants, who must trust his judgment. Unlike Plato, Murdoch \"is disabused of any hope of an outside\" and becomes the [[demiurge]] for the cave, the only environment he knows. Of the lack of background provided in the film, Loughlin said: \"The origin of the city is off-stage, unknown and unknowable.\"<ref name=\"loughlin\" />\n\nThe city in ''Dark City'' was described by Sarah L. Higley as a \"murky, nightmarish German expressionist film noir depiction of urban repression and mechanism\". It has a [[World War II]]-era dreariness reminiscent of [[Edward Hopper]]'s works, as well as details from different eras and architectures that are changed by the Strangers: \"buildings collapse as others emerge and battle with one another at the end\". The round window of Murdoch's hotel room is concave like a fishbowl, and is a frequently seen element throughout the city. The inhabitants do not live at the top of the city; the main characters' homes are dwarfed by the [[bricolage]] of buildings.<ref>{{Citation | last=Higley | first=Sarah L. | title=A Taste for Shrinking: Movie Miniatures and the Unreal City | journal=Camera Obscura | year=2001 | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] | volume=16 | issue=2 47 | pages=9\u201312 | issn=0270-5346 | doi=10.1215/02705346-16-2_47-1 | s2cid=192198570 }}</ref>\n\nThe film contains motifs from [[Greek mythology]], in which gods manipulate humans to serve a higher agenda.
