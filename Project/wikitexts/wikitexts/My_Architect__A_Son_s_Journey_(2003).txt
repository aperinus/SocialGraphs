How accidental are our existences are really, and how full of influence by circumstance.\u201d\n\nThe film features interviews with renowned architects, including [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Shamsul Wares]],<ref>''My Architect'', later parts of the documentary</ref> [[I.M. Pei]], [[Moshe Safdie]] and [[Anne Tyng]]. Throughout the film, Kahn visits all of his father's buildings including The [[Yale Center for British Art]], The [[Salk Institute]], [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] and the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]].\n\nThe film explores Kahn's family life which involved his fathering children by three different partners, each of whom was kept in the dark about the existence of his other families. Reviewing the film in ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', David Schwartz wrote: \"This absorbing, beautiful documentary is the first-person odyssey of Nathaniel Kahn, son of legendary architect Louis Kahn by one of his longtime mistresses. Despite his accomplishments, Kahn Sr. died a penniless loner in Penn Station in 1974, leaving behind three families, none of them aware of the others' existence. Seeking to unravel his father's mysterious personal life, Nathaniel combines rare personal footage and compelling interviews with the elder Kahn's colleagues, friends, and families.\"<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/my-architect-a-sons-journey/Film?oid=1070907| title = ''My Architect: A Son's Journey''| author = Schwartz, David| date = March 29, 2003| accessdate = 2017-05-10| publisher = chicagoreader.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''My Architect'' achieved a score of 81 on the critical aggregator website [[Metacritic]], signifying \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-architect/critic-reviews| title = ''My Architect'' critic reviews| date = November 12, 2003 | accessdate = 2017-05-10\n| publisher = [[Metacritic]]}}</ref> ''My Architect'' has an approval rating of 93% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 91 reviews, and an average rating of 7.57/10.
