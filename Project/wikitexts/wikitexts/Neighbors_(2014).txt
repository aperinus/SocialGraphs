Cohen]] and [[Brendan O'Brien (screenwriter)|Brendan O'Brien]]. The film stars [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Zac Efron]] with [[Rose Byrne]], [[Dave Franco]] and [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] in supporting roles. The plot follows a couple who come into conflict with a [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] that has recently moved in next door, which leads them into an all out war.\n\nThe film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 8, 2014 and was released on May 9 in the United States. The film received positive reviews, with praise aimed at Efron's breakout performance, and was a commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide, and became Rogen's highest grossing live-action film. A sequel, ''[[Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising]]'', was released on May 20, 2016, with Stoller returned to direct, and much of the cast reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\nMac Radner and his Australian-born wife Kelly are adjusting to life with their infant daughter, Stella. The restrictions of parenthood make it difficult for them to maintain their old lifestyle, which alienates them from their friends Jimmy Blevins and his ex-wife, Paula. Delta Psi Beta, a [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] known for outrageous parties, moves in next door. The fraternity's leaders, Teddy Sanders and Pete Regazolli, aspire to join Delta Psi's Hall of Fame by throwing a massive end-of-the-year party.\n\nThe Radners ask Teddy to keep the noise down, and to earn their favor, he invites them to join the party. Kelly meets Teddy's girlfriend Brooke Shy, and Teddy shows Mac his bedroom, which includes a stash of fireworks and a [[distribution board|breaker box]] that controls the house\u2019s power. Teddy agrees to manage the noise, but has Mac and Kelly promise to always call him instead of the police. The following night, when the party next door keeps Stella awake, Mac is unable to reach Teddy. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police anonymously, but Officer Watkins identifies them to Teddy. Betrayed, Teddy leads Delta Psi in [[hazing]] Mac and Kelly, resulting in Stella nearly eating an unused condom after the fraternity dumps their garbage on the Radners\u2019 lawn. Mac and Kelly go to the college [[Dean (education)|dean]] Carol Gladstone, but the school has a \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy before it will intervene; Delta Psi's first strike was burning down their old house.\n\nFailing to force the fraternity to move by damaging their house, Kelly manipulates Pete and Brooke into having sex, and Mac leads Teddy to catch them in the act. Teddy and Pete fight, and a barbecue grill injures a passing professor. This gives Delta Psi their second strike and places them on probation, effectively ending their party plans. Determined to shut down the fraternity, Mac and Kelly enlist the help of Jimmy, who is jealous that Paula is sleeping with Delta Psi member Scoonie. To acquire evidence of Delta Psi's hazing, they hire a pledge nicknamed Assjuice to stand up to Teddy and record him threatening retaliation. When Teddy instead shows him kindness, he reveals that Mac and Kelly hired him and are trying to sabotage the fraternity. A vengeful Teddy violently pranks the Radners and Jimmy with [[airbag]]s.\n\nThey send Teddy a counterfeit letter from Gladstone lifting Delta Psi\u2019s probation. The fraternity prepares for their end-of-the-year party, which Mac, Kelly, and Jimmy widely publicize to ensure it will be out of control. Once the party is in full swing, they notify the police, but Teddy realizes what the Radners have done, and stops the party just as Watkins arrives. Jimmy throws himself from the balcony to distract Teddy, allowing Kelly to sneak into Teddy's bedroom as Mac fights him off. Unable to open the breaker box to restart the party and alert Watkins, Kelly shoots one of the fireworks at his patrol car. Paula convinces Scoonie to turn on the power, reigniting the party, and she reunites with Jimmy. Teddy takes the blame for the party, convincing Pete to flee with the others, and is arrested; the fraternity is shut down.\n\nFour months later, Mac runs into Teddy, who is working as a shirtless greeter at [[Abercrombie & Fitch]]. They greet each other warmly and Teddy reveals he is attending night classes to complete his degree. Mac takes off his shirt and jokingly acts as a greeter with Teddy. Later, Mac and Kelly take pictures of Stella in various costumes for a calendar. They get a call from Jimmy and Paula inviting them to attend [[Burning Man]]. Mac and Kelly decline, accepting their new roles as parents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Mac Radner, Kelly's husband\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Teddy Sanders, president of Delta Psi Beta\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Kelly Radner, Mac's foul-mouthed Australian wife\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Scoonie Schofield, a member of Delta Psi Beta\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Pete Regazolli, vice-president of Delta Psi Beta\n* [[Ike Barinholtz]] as Jimmy Blevins, Mac and Kelly's friend\n* [[Carla Gallo]] as Paula Faldt-Blevins, Jimmy's ex-wife\n* [[Jerrod Carmichael]] as Garfield \u201cGarf\u201d Slade, a member of Delta Psi Beta\n* [[Craig Roberts]] as Gary \"Assjuice\", a member of Delta Psi Beta\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Dean Carol Gladstone\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Officer Watkins\n* [[Halston Sage]] as Brooke Shy\n* [[Ali Cobrin]] as Whitney\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Dr. Theodorakis\n* [[Brian Huskey]] as Bill Wazowkowski, Mac's boss\n* [[Liz Cackowski]] as Wendy, Mac and Kelly's realtor\n* [[Natasha Leggero]] as herself\n[[Andy Samberg]], [[Akiva Schaffer]], [[Jorma Taccone]], [[Adam DeVine]], [[Blake Anderson]], [[Anders Holm]], [[Kyle Newacheck]], and [[Jake Johnson]] make [[cameo appearance]]s as historical members of Delta Psi Beta.\n\n==Production==\n[[Seth Rogen]] and [[Zac Efron]] became attached to the film before it was pitched to studios.<ref name=\"indiewire1\">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Interview: 'Neighbors' Star Seth Rogen Talks Making It Relatable, Improv With Zac Efron And The Movie's Distinctive Look|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/interview-neighbors-star-seth-rogen-talks-making-it-relatable-improv-with-zac-efron-and-the-movies-distinctive-look-86248/|website=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=August 8, 2014|date=May 8, 2014}}</ref> [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and [[New Line Cinema]] put in bids for the film, with Universal eventually securing the rights of the then-untitled project in July 2011, which was written by [[Andrew J.
