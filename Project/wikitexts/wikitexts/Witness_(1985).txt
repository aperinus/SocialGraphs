The film focuses on a police detective (Ford) protecting an [[Amish]] woman (McGillis) and her young son (Haas), who becomes a target after he witnesses a brutal murder in a Philadelphia train station.\n\nFilmed in 1984, ''Witness'' was released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the winter of 1985. The film went on to become a [[sleeper hit]], grossing over $116 million worldwide. At the [[58th Academy Awards]], it earned eight nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Ford, winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. It was also nominated for seven [[BAFTA Awards]], winning one for [[Maurice Jarre]]'s score, and six [[Golden Globe Awards]]. William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace won the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and the 1986 [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay winners|Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay]] presented by the [[Mystery Writers of America]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1984, an [[Amish]] community outside [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], attends the funeral of Jacob Lapp, who leaves behind his wife Rachel and eight-year-old son Samuel. Rachel and Samuel travel by train to visit Rachel's sister, which takes them into [[Philadelphia]]. While at [[30th Street Station]] waiting for a connecting train, Samuel goes into the men's room and witnesses the brutal murder of an undercover police officer.\n\nDetective John Book and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter, are assigned to the case. They question Samuel, who is unable to identify the perpetrator from mugshots or a line-up. Samuel then sees a newspaper clipping in a trophy case of officer James McFee receiving an award, and points him out to Book. Book investigates and finds out that McFee was previously responsible for a seizure of expensive chemicals used to make black-market [[amphetamines]], but the evidence has now disappeared. Book surmises that McFee sold the chemicals to drug dealers, and that the murdered detective had been investigating the theft. Book expresses his suspicions to Chief of Police Paul Schaeffer, who advises Book to keep the case secret so they can work out how to proceed. Book is later ambushed and shot in a parking garage by McFee and left badly wounded. Since only Schaeffer knew of Book's suspicions, he realizes Schaeffer is also corrupt and tipped off McFee.\n\nKnowing Samuel and Rachel are now in danger, Book orders his partner to remove all traces of the Lapps from his files, and drives the boy and his mother back to their community where he passes out in front of their farm. Book insists that going to a hospital would allow the corrupt police officers to find him and put Samuel in danger. Rachel's father-in-law Eli reluctantly agrees to shelter him.\n\nBook slowly recovers in their care and begins to blend into the community. He and Rachel are also drawn to each other romantically, although they refrain from acting on their feelings. Meanwhile, Schaeffer searches for Book by contacting authorities in the Amish area but, as Amish communities have no modern means of communication and little contact with the outside world, he hits repeated dead ends.\n\nBook eventually goes into town with Eli to use a [[payphone]] to call his precinct, and learns that Carter has been killed. While in town, a group harasses the Amish. Book retaliates, breaking with the Amish tradition of nonviolence. The fight is reported to the local police and eventually gets back to Schaeffer.\n\nThe next day, Schaeffer, McFee, and another corrupt cop, Ferguson, arrive at the Lapp farm, taking Rachel and Eli hostage. Book tricks Ferguson into the [[Silo|corn silo]] and [[Grain entrapment|suffocates him under tons of corn]], then uses Ferguson's shotgun to kill McFee. Schaeffer holds Rachel and Eli at gunpoint but Eli signals to Samuel to ring the farm's bell. Book confronts Schaeffer who threatens to kill Rachel, but the loud bell has summoned their neighbors. With so many witnesses present, Schaeffer gives up and Book arrests him.\n\nBook says goodbye to Samuel in the fields and Eli wishes him well \"out there among them English,\" and Book departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Sergeant John Book\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Rachel Lapp\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Samuel Lapp\n* [[Jan Rube\u0161]] as Eli Lapp\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Chief Paul Schaeffer\n* [[Alexander Godunov]] as Daniel Hochleitner\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Lieutenant James McFee\n* [[Brent Jennings]] as Sergeant Elton Carter\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Elaine Book\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Sergeant Leon \"Fergie\" Ferguson\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Moses Hochleitner\n* [[Frederick Rolf]] as Stoltzfus\n* [[Timothy Carhart]] as Detective Ian Zenovich\n* [[Richard Chaves]] as Detective Sykes\n* [[Robert Earl Jones]] as Harry\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''The Amish in the American Imagination'' (2001), scholar David Weaver-Zercher notes that ''Witness'' is primarily concerned with the intersection of contrasting cultures, a common theme present in several of director Peter Weir's other films, such as ''[[The Last Wave]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Weaver-Zercher|2001|p=154}} Weaver-Zercher notes that the conflict between Amish and non-Amish as depicted in ''Witness'' \"reflect[s] well on the Amish ways\" and also serves as a redemption story for Sergeant Book, who regains a new sense of humanity during his displacement in the Amish community.{{sfn|Weaver-Zercher|2001|pages=154\u2013155}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducer [[Edward S. Feldman]], who was in a \"first-look\" development deal with [[20th Century Fox]] at the time, first received the screenplay for ''Witness'' in 1983. Originally entitled ''Called Home'' (which is the Amish term for death), it ran for 182 pages, the equivalent of three hours of screen time. The script, which had been circulating in Hollywood for several years, had been inspired by an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace had written in the 1970s, which had been based upon an idea by novelist Pamela Wallace.{{sfn|McGivern|2020|p=2}}{{sfn|Feldman|2005|pages=180\u2013190}}\n\nFeldman liked the concept, but felt too much of the script was devoted to Amish traditions, diluting the thriller aspects of the story. He offered Kelley and Wallace $25,000 for a one-year option and one rewrite, and an additional $225,000 if the film actually were made. They submitted the revised screenplay in less than six weeks, and Feldman delivered it to Fox. Joe Wizan, the studio's head of production, rejected it with the statement that Fox did not make \"rural movies\".{{sfn|Feldman|2005|p=191}}\n\nFeldman sent the screenplay to Harrison Ford's agent [[The Gersh Agency|Phil Gersh]], who contacted the producer four days later and advised him his client was willing to commit to the film. Certain the attachment of a major star would change Wizan's mind, Feldman approached him once again, but Wizan insisted that as much as the studio liked Ford, they still were not interested in making a \"rural movie.\"{{sfn|Feldman|2005|pages=190\u2013191}}\n\nFeldman sent the screenplay to numerous studios, and was rejected by all of them, until [[Paramount Pictures]] finally expressed interest. Feldman's first choice of director was [[Peter Weir]], but he was involved in preproduction work for ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'' and passed on the project. [[John Badham]] dismissed it as \"just another cop movie\", and others Feldman approached either were committed to other projects or had no interest. Then, as financial backing for ''The Mosquito Coast'' fell through, Weir became free to direct ''Witness'', which was his first American film. Starting the film immediately was imperative, because a [[Directors Guild of America]] strike was looming.{{sfn|Feldman|2005|p=188}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Lynne Littman]] had originally been in talks to direct the film, and though she ultimately did not, she recommended Lukas Haas for the part of Samuel because she had recently worked with him on her film ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. The role of Rachel was the most difficult to cast, and after Weir grew frustrated with the auditions he had seen, he asked the casting director to look for actors in Italy because he thought they would be more \"womanly\".  As they were reviewing audition tapes from Italy, Kelly McGillis came to audition, and the moment she put on the bonnet and spoke a few lines, Weir knew she was the one. The casting director recommended her old friend Alexander Godunov, who had never acted before, but she thought his personality would be right, and Weir agreed.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\n\nViggo Mortensen was cast because Weir thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. Mortensen had just started his acting career, so this was his first film acting role, and he had to turn down another role as a soldier in [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park's]] production of'' [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.<ref name=\"dvdextra\">{{cite AV media |people=Keith Clark and Jon Mefford |date=2005 |title=Witness |chapter=Between Two Worlds: The Making of ''Witness'' |medium=DVD |publisher=Paramount Pictures |oclc=949729643 }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nDuring the weeks before filming, Ford spent time with the homicide department of the Philadelphia Police Department, researching the important details of working as a homicide detective. McGillis did research by moving in with an Amish widow and her seven children, learning how to milk cows and practicing their Pennsylvania German dialect.<ref name=wygantmc>{{cite interview|last=McGillis|first=Kelly|interviewer=[[Bobbie Wygant]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSXV-xN5RT4|title=Kelly McGillis for \"Witness'|date=January 24, 1985|work=The Bobbie Wygant Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=http://ghostarchive.org/varchive/CSXV-xN5RT4|archive-date=June 4, 2022}}</ref>\n\nWeir and cinematographer John Seale went on a trip to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], which was running an exhibition of 17th-century Dutch Masters. Weir drew attention to the paintings of [[Johannes Vermeer]], which were used as inspiration for the lighting and composition of the film, especially in the scenes where John Book is recovering from a gunshot wound in Rachel's house.<ref name=\"dvdextra\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot on location in Philadelphia and the city and towns of [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Strasburg, Pennsylvania|Strasburg]], and [[Parkesburg]]. Local Amish were willing to work as carpenters and electricians, but declined to appear on film, so many of the [[Extra (actor)|extras]] were actually [[Mennonite]]s. Halfway through filming, the title was changed from ''Called Home'' to ''Witness'' at the behest of Paramount's marketing department, which felt the original title posed too much of a promotional challenge. Principal photography was completed three days before the scheduled DGA strike, which ultimately failed to materialize.{{sfn|Feldman|2005|pages=189\u2013191}}\n\nDuring the set-up and rehearsal of each scene, as well as during [[dailies]], Weir would play music to set the mood, with the idea that it prevented the actors from thinking too much and let them listen to their other instincts. The barn-raising scene was only a short paragraph in the script, but Weir thought it was important to highlight that aspect of Amish community life. They shot the scene in a day and did, in fact, build a barn, albeit with the aid of cranes off-camera. To film the scene in the corn silo, corn was actually dropped onto the actor, while a scuba diving regulator with a compressed air tank was hidden on the floor so the actor would be able to breathe.<ref name=\"dvdextra\" />\n\nOriginally, the script ended with a scene of Book and Rachel each explaining their feelings for each other to the audience, but Weir felt the scene was unnecessary and decided not to shoot it. The studio executives were concerned that the audience would not understand the conclusion, and tried to convince him otherwise, but Weir insisted that the characters' emotions could be expressed only with visuals.<ref name=\"dvdextra\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Witness'' had its world premiere at the [[Fulton Opera House]] in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in on February 7, 1985.<ref name=fulton>{{cite news|url=https://lancasteronline.com/features/throwback-thursday-witness-premiered-at-fulton-30-years-ago/article_50e9324c-b2d6-11e4-ae0c-17a87103bccf.html|work=[[LNP (newspaper)|LPN]]|title=Throwback Thursday: 'Witness' premiered at Fulton 30 years ago|last=Wright|first=Mary Ellen|date=February 12, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220604040259/https://lancasteronline.com/features/throwback-thursday-witness-premiered-at-fulton-30-years-ago/article_50e9324c-b2d6-11e4-ae0c-17a87103bccf.html|archive-date=June 4, 2022}}</ref> The film was screened out of competition at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/927/year/1985.html |title= Festival de Cannes: Witness |access-date=July 8, 2009| work= festival-cannes.com }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Witness'' opened theatrically in 876 theaters in the United States on February 8, 1985, and grossed $4,539,990 in its opening weekend, ranking number two behind ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.

The National Committee For Amish Religious Freedom called for a boycott of the movie soon after its release, citing fears that these communities were being \"overrun by tourists\" as a result of the popularity of the movie, and worried that \"the crowding, souvenir-hunting, photographing and trespassing on Amish farmsteads will increase.\" After the movie was completed, Pennsylvania governor [[Dick Thornburgh]] agreed not to promote Amish communities as future film sites.
