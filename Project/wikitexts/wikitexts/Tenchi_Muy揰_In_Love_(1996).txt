Ryo-Ohki|original OVAs]] at several points. Most noticeable of these is the inclusion of [[Achika Masaki|Achika]] as [[Tenchi Masaki|Tenchi's]] mother instead of [[Tenchi Muyo! (OVA)#Kiyone Masaki|Kiyone Masaki]]. It was followed by ''[[Tenchi Forever! The Movie|Tenchi Forever!]]'', released in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be kept between 400 to 700 words. -->\nAfter being defeated by the Jurai Emperor and the Galaxy Police centuries ago, the monstrously powerful Super A-1 class criminal Kain was imprisoned in the subspace room of the GP's headquarters, never to be released.\n\nIn the present (established to be 1996, the year of the film's release), Kain escapes his bonds, destroys the GP space station, and travels back in time to take his revenge on Jurai's royal family. The Galaxy Police only has time to send a short warning, which Mihoshi and Kiyone intercept.\n\nThe Masaki house, the shrine, and [[Tenchi Masaki|Tenchi]] himself all begin to fade out of existence. Washu theorizes that someone is tampering with the established timeline, and uses a shield to keep Tenchi from vanishing. The shield is only a temporary solution, so Washu sends the rest of the group back to 1970 to prevent Kain from killing Tenchi's mother Achika.\n\nTenchi's friends assume roles at Tenchi's father Nobuyuki and Achika's high school, while Tenchi himself stays hidden to prevent causing a [[paradox]]. Tenchi and his friends must also deal with a rogue GP operative bent on seizing glory by killing Kain.\n\nAfter determining the exact time that Kain strikes in 1970, the group tries to defend Achika, only to see the villain escape into subspace with her and Nobuyuki. Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko follow and challenge Kain, but even with their powers boosted by Washu they are no match for him.\n\nWashu sends a powerful \"dimensional cannon\" from the present, and Kiyone mans the weapon to destroy Kain. Tenchi is wounded, and Achika unlocks her latent Jurai powers to fuel his sword and deal a crippling blow to Kain. The group barely escapes in time before the dimensional cannon is fired into their pocket of subspace, finally destroying Kain.\n\nBefore her memory is wiped along with Nobuyuki's, Achika asks Ryoko and Ayeka to take care of Tenchi, since she will not be there for him in their present.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Masami Kikuchi]] as Tenchi Masaki <ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Ai Orikasa]] as Ryoko<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Megumi Hayashibara]] as Achika<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Yumi Takada]] as Ayeka<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Chisa Yokoyama]] as Sasami<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Etsuko Kozakura]] as Ryo-Ohki<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo]] as Kain<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] as young Nobuyuki Masaki<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Yuko Kobayashi]] as Washu<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Yuko Mizutani]] as Mihoshi<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Yuri Amano]] as Kiyone<ref name=\"Beck\"/>\n* [[Takeshi Aono]] as Nobuyuki Masaki\n\n==Music==\nThe music for ''Tenchi in Love'' was composed by [[Christopher Franke]]<ref name=\"Beck\"/> (formerly of [[Tangerine Dream]] and the main composer for the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' series).\n\nThe end theme song is ''Alchemy of Love'', written by Franke and performed by [[Nina Hagen]], with [[Rick Jude]] on backing vocals.\n\nThere is also an Achika version of the song, with new Japanese lyrics, and is performed by [[Megumi Hayashibara]] (Achika's Japanese voice actress). The Achika version is available on a single mini-CD (''Pioneer PIDA-1033'') and on the Japanese LaserDisc version of the movie, as a music video, which also features the original English version.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Tenchi in Love!'' had its US television premiere during [[SyFy|Sci-Fi Channel's]] (now SyFy) Anime theme week on August 26, 1996.\n\nIn North America, it was initially released on home video in the '90s by [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer Entertainment USA]]  before they released it independently on DVD in 2003. This release was one of the few releases from Pioneer/Geneon to have [[THX]]-certified video, re-mastered for superior picture quality, and with the audio, remixed in [[5.1]] [[Dolby Digital]] AC3 surround sound. After Pioneer's shut down in 2007, [[FUNimation Entertainment]] announced the license of the movie, along with a handful of other Geneon titles. The movie is distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand and by [[MVM Films]] in the United Kingdom. It was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in North America in December 2012 by FUNimation in a box set with the other ''Tenchi'' movies.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{anime News Network|anime|id=230|title=Tenchi Muyo Movie 1: Tenchi in Love}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.cjas.org/~echen/articles/fall96/10_26b.html|title=The Tenchi Muyo in Love Premiere at Anime Expo '96|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104123842/http://www.cjas.org/~echen/articles/fall96/10_26b.html|archive-date=2007-11-04}}\n* {{IMDb title|0117876}}\n\n{{Tenchi Muyo!}}\n{{AIC films}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1996 anime films]]\n[[Category:Adventure anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime International Company]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Animated films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1996]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Harem anime and manga]]\n[[Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Tenchi Muyo! films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christopher Franke]]"}]}}}}
