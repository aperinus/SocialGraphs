The screenplay was adapted by [[Richard LaGravenese]]. [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] was co-producer.  It was produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Malpaso Productions]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]].\n\nThe film is set in 1965, featuring Italian [[war bride]], Francesca Johnson ([[Meryl Streep]]), who lives with her husband and two children on their Iowa farm. That year she meets ''[[National Geographic]]'' photojournalist, Robert Kincaid ([[Clint Eastwood]]), who comes to Madison County to photograph its historic covered bridges. With Francesca's family away for a short trip, the couple have an intense, four-day love affair. The film earned $182&nbsp;million worldwide<ref name=\"mojo\"/> and was well-received by critics. Streep was [[68th Academy Awards|nominated in 1996]] for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present, adult siblings Michael and Carolyn Johnson arrive at the [[Iowa]] farmhouse of their recently deceased mother, Francesca, to settle her estate. They are shocked upon learning that Francesca requested to be cremated and her ashes scattered from [[Roseman Covered Bridge]], rather than be buried next to her late husband, Richard.\n\nMichael initially refuses, but while he and Carolyn look through the safe deposit box, they discover an envelope containing photographs, letters, and a key. The photos are of Francesca taken at the [[Holliwell Covered Bridge]] and the letters are from a man named Robert Kincaid. The key is to Francesca's locked hope chest. In it are three hardbound notebooks. There are also several ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazines, including one featuring [[Madison County, Iowa|Madison County's]] [[List of covered bridges in Madison County, Iowa|covered wooden bridges]],<ref>{{cite web| url= http://madisoncounty.com/index.php?page=the-bridges| title= The Bridges of Madison County| publisher= Madison County Chamber of Commerce| access-date= 2011-08-19| archive-date= March 30, 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330231500/http://madisoncounty.com/index.php?page=the-bridges| url-status= dead}}</ref> old cameras, a book, and other mementos. The magazine includes a photo of Kincaid, who photographed the bridges; he is wearing Francesca's crucifix pendant.\n\nAs Michael and Carolyn begin reading Francesca's notebooks, the film flashes back to 1965. Francesca, a [[World War II|WWII]] [[Italian diaspora|Italian]] [[war bride]], stays home while her husband and teenaged son and daughter attend the state fair for the next four days. Robert Kincaid, a ''National Geographic'' photojournalist on assignment to photograph the county's historic bridges, arrives at the Johnson farm, asking for directions to Roseman Bridge. Francesca rides along to show him the way. Their subsequent affair occurs over four days.\n\nFrancesca details the intense affair and its lasting influence on both her and Robert, hoping Michael and Carolyn will understand and honor her final request. Francesca and Robert fell deeply in love and nearly ran away together. Francesca, confined to a passionless marriage, was unable to abandon her teenage children and loyal husband. Though she loved Robert, she questioned whether their spontaneous relationship could survive over time. Robert, moved by their brief encounter, found renewed meaning in his life and true calling as an artist. Francesca's memories helped sustain her through the remaining years on the farm.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Francesca attempted to contact Robert, but he had left ''National Geographic'' and his whereabouts were unknown. She later learned that Robert died about three years after her husband, and he left his belongings to her. His ashes were scattered from Roseman Bridge.\n\nIn the present, Michael and Carolyn, struggling with their own marriages, are deeply moved by their mother's story. They find new direction to their individual lives and carry out their mother's wishes to scatter her ashes at Roseman Bridge.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Robert Kincaid\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Francesca Johnson\n* [[Annie Corley]] as Carolyn Johnson\n** Sarah Kathryn Schmitt as young Carolyn\n* [[Victor Slezak]] as Michael Johnson\n** Christopher Kroon as young Michael\n* Jim Haynie as Richard Johnson\n* Phyllis Lyons as Betty\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Madge\n* Richard Lage as Lawyer Peterson\n* Michelle Benes as Lucy Redfield\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quotebox\n|quote=\"I've been that guy a little bit, going off by myself years ago in a pickup truck into Nevada, scouting locations for ''[[High Plains Drifter]]''.

Limited by the vapidity of this material while he trims its excesses with the requisite machete, Mr. Eastwood locates a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of [[Robert James Waller|Mr. Waller's]] self-congratulatory overkill. The movie has leanness and surprising decency, and Meryl Streep has her best role in years. Looking sturdy and voluptuous in her plain housedress (the year is 1965), Ms. Streep rises straight out of ''[[Christina's World]]'' to embody all the loneliness and fierce yearning [[Andrew Wyeth]] captured on canvas. And yet, despite the Iowa setting and the emphasis on down-home Americana, Mr. Eastwood's ''Bridges of Madison County'' has a European flavor. Its pace is unhurried, which is not the same as slow. It respects long silences and pays attention to small details. It sustains an austere tone and staves off weepiness until the last reel. It voices musings that would definitely sound better in French.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01E3DC1639F931A35755C0A963958260 | title= Love Comes Driving Up the Road, and in Middle Age, Too | date= June 2, 1995| first= Janet |last= Maslin| author-link= Janet Maslin| work=The New York Times|  access-date=2011-08-16}}</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] said Eastwood is the \"most reticent of directors\u2014where the book ogles, the film discreetly observes\u2014and, here, the courtliest of stars....As scripted by [[Richard LaGravenese]] (''[[The Fisher King (film)|The Fisher King]]''), the Madison County movie has a slightly riper theme than the book's.
