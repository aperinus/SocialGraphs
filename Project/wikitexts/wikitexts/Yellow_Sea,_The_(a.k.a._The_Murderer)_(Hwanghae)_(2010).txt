This film marks the reunion of the director and the lead actors who also first collaborated for the 2008 film ''[[The Chaser (2008 film)|The Chaser]]'', in which Ha Jung-woo played the antagonist and Kim Yoon-seok played the protagonist. In ''The Yellow Sea'', Ha Jung-woo plays the protagonist while Kim Yoon-seok plays the antagonist.\n\nThe film revolves around a cab driver who agrees to carry out a hit on a professor in exchange for getting his debts paid. He soon becomes a fugitive after the hit goes wrong, and is chased by both the police and the gangster who assigned him the task.\n\n''The Yellow Sea'' was released in South Korea on 22 December 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn northeastern Chinese city of [[Yanji]] in [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian Prefecture]], Gu-nam ([[Ha Jung-woo]]), an ethnic Korean, or [[Joseonjok]], toils away as a taxi driver. When not working, he is often found at gambling halls. Gu-nam is now in serious debt. His wife left to work in South Korea and promised to send money back. He has yet to hear from her and is tormented by nightmares of her having an extra-marital affair. To make matters worse, Gu-nam is fired from his job and debt collectors take most of his severance pay.\n\nLocal gangster, Myun Jung-hak ([[Kim Yoon-seok]]), offers him a deal: if Gu-nam goes to South Korea to kill a professor named Kim Seung-hyun, he will get {{CNY|57,000}} ({{USD|10,000}}). Gu-nam accepts and leaves for South Korea by train and a rickety fishing boat, with {{USD|500}} for expenses.\n\nWhen Gu-nam arrives in South Korea, he carefully scopes out his target for days, while also searching for his wife. The night before his boat is due to return to China, Gu-nam witnesses Kim Seung-hyun being ambushed and killed by his driver and two accomplices inside his apartment building's stairwell. After fending off the driver, Gu-nam cuts off Seung-hyun's thumb, as per Mr. Myun's contract, but is spotted by Seung-hyun's wife and is forced to flee the police. Upon arriving at the supposed location for the boat back to China, there is no one to pick Gu-nam up, and he realizes he's been set up. It is revealed that a businessman named Kim Tae-won had hired the driver to kill Seung-hyun. Tae-won turns his gang's attention to finding Gu-nam. After discovering that Gu-nam was hired by Myun, Tae-won sends his men to China to have Myun killed as well, but Myun kills them and instead returns to Korea to force a meeting with Tae-won. They strike a deal, with Tae-won promising to pay out Myun for finding and killing Gu-nam.\n\nOn the run from the police, Gu-nam abducts and interrogates one of Myun's smugglers and arranges a return to China via cargo ship. At the same time, he sees reports on TV that a woman matching the description of his wife had been killed by a man he had investigated as being connected to his wife earlier. Gu-nam hires an outside investigator to check the body and confirm if the woman killed was his wife, and when the investigator cannot tell if it is her, he lies to Gu-nam and arranges to have the woman cremated and the ashes delivered to Gu-nam.\n\nAfter arriving at the cargo ship, Gu-nam realizes he has been set up yet again and is cornered by Myun's men and almost killed, but is able to escape. Some of Myun's men are arrested and point the police towards Tae-won, who sends men to the apartment complex Myun and his crew is staying at to have him killed. The rest of Myun's crew are killed, but Myun defeats Tae-won's crew, burns down the complex, and leaves to find Tae-won. Gu-nam returns to Seung-hyun's apartment, promising to Seung-hyun's wife to kill the man responsible for having her husband murdered. Myun ambushes Tae-won at his gang's headquarters, and after a lengthy conflict, the two are mortally wounded. During Gu-nam's search, he is ambushed and abducted by two goons, but kills them and retrieves a business card off of one of the goons for a banker who had been in contact with Myun. Gu-nam arrives at the station and stands over the dying Tae-won, who mumbles that Seung-hyun had an affair with his wife. Myun passes out at the wheel of his van and crashes at the station entrance, and dies from his wounds. At a restaurant, a wounded Gu-nam meets with the man who helped identify his wife and is given her ashes. After following the business card to a bank, he leaves after seeing Seung-hyun's wife talking to the banker who had hired Myun, deducing that she had hired him to kill her own husband. Both Tae-won and Seung-hyun's wife had put the hit on Seung-hyun; Tae-won for having an affair with his wife, Seung-hyun's wife for cheating.\n\nGu-nam heads to a pier and takes a fisherman hostage and orders him to go to Yanbian. While on the boat, he has a vision of his wife leaving on a train; he succumbs to his wounds en route back to China. The fisherman then dumps Gu-nam's body and the ashes in the water. In an ambiguous mid-credit scene, Gu-nam's wife arrives home by train.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ha Jung-woo]] as Gu-nam\n* [[Kim Yoon-seok]] as Myun Jung-hak\n* [[Jo Sung-ha]] as Tae-won\n* Lee Chul-min as Choi Sung-nam\n* [[Kwak Do-won]] as Prof. Kim Seung-hyun\n* Lim Ye-won as Prof. Kim's wife\n* Tak Sung-eun as Gu-nam's wife\n* Kim Ki-hwan as Prof. Kim's driver\n* Ki Se-hyung as Tae-won's subordinate\n* [[Lee El]] as Joo-young, Tae-won's mistress\n* Oh Yoon-hong as Tae-won's wife\n* [[Jung Man-sik]] as Detective\n* Jung Min-sung as Detective\n* Kim Dong-hyun as Detective\n* [[Park Byung-eun]] as bank employee\n* [[Jang So-yeon]] as employee at Do-man Hotel\n* Yang Ki-won as detective\n* Sung Byoung-sook as Gu-nam's mother\n* Kong Jung-hwan as Jeon Pil-kyoo\n* Baek Won-gil as Korean-Chinese kidnapper 1\n* Kang Hyun-joong as Busan port sailor\n* Yoo Ha-bok as Yanbian taxi boss\n* [[Lee Hee-joon]] as policeman\n* [[Lee Jun-hyeok (actor, born 1972)|Lee Jun-hyeok]] as dog seller 2\n* [[Kim Jae-hwa]] as Jung-hak's girlfriend (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html |title=Official Selection 2011 |work=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |accessdate=2015-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515065818/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 }}</ref> as well as the 2011 [[Filmfest M\u00fcnchen]].\n\nThe Australian and UK films rights were sold to Bounty Films.
