Set in [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], [[Houston]], [[Texas]], the story is about two [[PTSD|mentally scarred]] brothers who choose different paths in dealing with their tragic childhood. When the older brother finds love, he starts facing tough choices: continue to feel family responsibility for his younger brother, or follow his heart to be with his girlfriend.\n\n== Plot ==\nAs children, Jason and Joshua Alexander witnessed the fatal shooting of their abusive father, Mad Dog ([[Forest Whitaker]]), one night when he drunkenly [[domestic violence|attacked]] their mother. The family tragedy leaves deep scars and affects the two brothers to choose different paths in their future. Jason ([[Allen Payne]]) becomes a responsible young man who works as an assistant manager and [[retail clerk|sales clerk]] in a Houston [[electronic store|electronic shop]] and lives with his hard-working mom, Gloria ([[Suzzanne Douglas]]). Joshua ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]) has just been released from [[prison]]. Previously traumatized by his late father, Joshua has become a volatile, disturbed ex-con who is bound for a violent end. Jason and his mother try their best to make Joshua repent and change both his attitude and his ways. Unfortunately, Joshua has difficulties in staying out of trouble with both law and authority.\n\nOne day in the middle of his working hour, a beautiful young woman named Lyric ([[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]]), walks into the shop to buy a [[television]]. [[Love at first sight|Falling instantly in love with her]], Jason desperately tries everything to pursue her. At first, Lyric rejects Jason's attempts to get closer to her, but his persistence, sincerity, kindness, and humor eventually melt her heart and change her attitude. As Jason spends more time with Lyric, he becomes inspired to do more romantic things in order to win her love. These include: borrowing a [[bus|city bus]] for themselves to go on a date, setting up a mock [[picnic]] followed by [[slow dance|slow dancing]] in an abandoned bus station, and riding in a rowboat in the [[bayou]] until the two end up kissing and [[sexual intercourse|making love]] in the [[forest|woods]] that magically turn into a flower field, symbolizing their blooming love and unbridled passion. Despite his life improving by [[dating]] Lyric, Jason is still haunted by multiple episodic [[nightmare]]s of his childhood. \n\nMeanwhile, Lyric's brother, Alonzo ([[Treach]]), is setting up a plan to [[bank robbery|rob a bank]] with his gang and Joshua joins in. Lyric overhears their conversation about the robbery plan and immediately tells Jason about it. Lyric warns Jason not to cross her brother, and he promises her to only talk to Joshua, followed by offering her a literal town escape together. Lyric delightfully accepts that they agree to meet at the bayou. On the following day, the robbery goes wrong as Joshua arrives late. Even worse, he causes bedlam by independently terrorizing and beating one of the bank customers, although he escapes with the gang before the police arrive. As punishment for botching the plan, Joshua is brutally [[torture]]d by Alonzo and his gang. Back at home, as Jason informs his mom about his and Lyric's agreement to move away together, Joshua returns home covered in blood, severely wounded. Enraged, Jason breaks his promise to Lyric by confronting Alonzo to avenge his brother, ensuing a vicious fight in a [[public restroom]].\n\nJason reluctantly calls off his and Lyric's plan to escape town together, reasoning that Joshua would always need him, much to Lyric's utter dismay. When she furiously questions him about the nightmares that tie him to keep saving his ungrateful brother, Jason eventually opens up about his tragic family history that left him a lifetime of haunting guilt. It is revealed that after young Joshua pointed his mother's gun at Mad Dog, Jason wrestled it away from him, inadvertently killing Mad Dog himself. Having finally understood his [[PTSD|lifelong trauma]], Lyric comforts Jason. Nevertheless, she advises him to walk away from his incorrigible brother, if he wants them to stay together.\n\nLater in the evening, while Joshua is preparing a [[gun]] in the [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], Jason starts packing his [[suitcase]] at home after earning his mom's blessing for his wish to be with Lyric. Unbeknownst to Joshua, Rat ([[Eddie Griffin]]), their good friend, notices him from the same bar and is quickly aware of his intentions. Rat immediately warns Jason about Joshua's attempt to kill Alonzo and anyone connected and/or related to him, including Lyric. As Joshua arrives at Lyric's house, he begins [[murder|shooting down]] Alonzo's two crew members as personal revenge and finds Lyric in her bedroom. Jason races to Lyric's house and soon finds Joshua holding her at gunpoint, angrily asking about Alonzo's whereabouts as well as taking his jealousy out on her for taking away his older brother. Fed up with his brother's continual selfishness and disregard for others' well-being, Jason draws his gun at Joshua to teach him a lesson. Unfortunately, Joshua accidentally shoots Lyric on the shoulder. Horrified and devastated, Jason tearfully takes the injured and unconscious Lyric with him and eventually walks away from Joshua for good. Feeling abandoned, Joshua loses his will to live and decides to [[suicide|kill himself]], in earshot of everyone outside. Jason carries Lyric out of her home and takes her to the waiting [[ambulance]].\n\nThe film ends with Jason and the newly-recovered Lyric riding on a bus together, now enjoying their freedom to start a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Allen Payne]] as Jason Alexander, the main protagonist.
