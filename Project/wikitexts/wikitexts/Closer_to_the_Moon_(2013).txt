A young caf\u00e9 worker, Virgil ([[Harry Lloyd]]), is among the witnesses. Under the guise of making this film, the Ioanid Gang perform a heist of the [[National Bank of Romania]]. The following day, Virgil loiters around a film set and encounters the director, Flaviu ([[Allan Corduner]]), who requests him to buy vodka and give it to him whenever he asks.\n\nEight months before the heist took place, Max, Dumi, Iorgu and R\u0103zvan, heroes of the resistance during [[World War II]], celebrate New Year's Eve and the start of 1959. Max is divorcing his wife, Sonia ([[Monica B\u00eerl\u0103deanu]]). Alice returns from Moscow with her and Max's son, Mirel (Marcin Walewski), in tow. She re-introduces Mirel to his father, and they begin to bond.\n\nOne night, the Gang celebrates Dumi's birthday and reminisce about their early lives as revolutionaries. For fun, they plot the heist in order to rile up anti-Communist Romania, but then realize that Max is taking their conversation seriously. He convinces Dumi, Iorgu and R\u0103zvan to join him, but Alice says no as she has to raise Mirel. She changes her mind, however, when she learns that Mirel wants to join as the fifth person. Alice becomes enraged during the robbery when she sees Mirel filming it. After a couple of months, Iorgu unintentionally implicates himself, and the group is individually located and arrested by Comrade Holban ([[Anton Lesser]]) and his police officers. Their arrests happen on the same day as the ''[[Luna 2]]'' landing on the [[Moon]].\n\nOne year later, Virgil is an experienced camera assistant. He is called in by his boss, who informs him of a short film about to start production. Virgil is assigned to record it. It is then revealed that the film is a propaganda piece about the Ioanid Gang's crime. The group, who have been convicted and are awaiting their execution, are ordered by the [[Securitate]] to star in the film. Later, Virgil informs Flaviu that he was present during the robbery and its danger has been greatly exaggerated by the authorities. When the Gang arrive for filming, Alice begins to bond with Virgil. When Flaviu gets drunk and passes out, Max takes over directing. While setting up a shot, he secretly gives Virgil contact details for the Gang's loved ones, requesting he contact them to let them know the group is alive and in prison. Later, Virgil makes an anonymous call to the first person on the list, and continues to do so with the help of his landlord Moritz ([[David de Keyser]]).\n\nOne night, Virgil is taken to Holban's house. Holban reveals that he knows Virgil has been doing favours for the Gang, and asks him to keep doing so in order to win their trust. He asks Virgil to find the sixth member of the group, Alice's son, as the Gang will be executed soon. During a commotion on set one day, Alice slips away. Virgil follows her to a house, where she says goodbye to her son. Afterwards, they have dinner at Virgil's house and sleep together. The next morning, Alice surrenders to the guards keeping surveillance outside, and leaves Virgil with sealed instructions. Virgil is approached by Holban and asked to write the address of Mirel, but he feigns unawareness.\n\nMax's ex-brother-in-law ([[Darrell D'Silva]]) arrives and relieves Holban of duty due to negligence and exhaustion. Max asks him to send the Gang into space instead of executing them, but he angrily retorts that astronauts should be heroes and not traitors. Alice's letter asks Virgil to organize Mirel's [[Bar Mitzvah]], which he does. Iorgu, Dumi, R\u0103zvan and Max are sent before the firing squad. In voiceover, Alice says that, at the last moment, her sentence was changed to life imprisonment because she had fallen [[pregnant]]. The audience is then told that Alice emigrated to Israel with Mirel and her daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Alice Bercovich\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Max Rosenthal\n* [[Harry Lloyd]] as Virgil\n* [[Anton Lesser]] as Comrade Holban\n* [[Christian McKay]] as Iorgu Ristea\n* [[Tim Plester]] as Dumitru \"Dumi\" Dorneanu\n* [[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]] as R\u0103zvan Orodel\n* Marcin Walewski as Mirel Bercovich\n* [[Darrell D'Silva]] as Minister\n* [[Stuart McQuarrie]] as [[Dumitru D\u0103m\u0103ceanu]]\n* [[Monica B\u00eerl\u0103deanu]] as Sonia Rosenthal\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as Flaviu\n* [[David de Keyser]] as Moritz Zilber\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Sarah Zilber\n* Andrew Buckley as Gogu\n* [[Martin Hancock]] as Prosecutor\n* [[John Henshaw]] as Judge\n* [[Gwyneth Keyworth]] as Lidia\n* [[Paul Jesson]] as Studio Manager\n* [[Ionut Grama]] as Boris\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written and directed by [[Nae Caranfil]], and produced by Michael Fitzgerald, Denis Friedman, Renata Rainieri, Alessandro Leone and Bobby Paunescu through the production company [[Mandragora Movies]].
