The plot follows a career con artist who takes an aspiring [[femme fatale]] under his wing.\n\nThe film was released on February 27, 2015. It received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, grossing $158 million against its $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSeasoned [[con-man]] Nicky Spurgeon ([[Will Smith]]) meets an inexperienced [[wikt:grifter|grifter]], Jess Barrett ([[Margot Robbie]]), who tries to seduce and con him,  pretending they've been caught by her jealous husband. When they fail, Nicky advises them never to lose focus when faced with unexpected situations. Nicky follows Jess and convinces her to have drinks, he tells her how his father shot his grandfather in a stand-off, explaining the \"Toledo Panic Button\" tactic, in which you shoot your partner to show your loyalty.\n\nJess follows him to [[New Orleans]], successfully persuading Nicky to take her under his wing, where she is also introduced to Nicky's crew, including the obese and profane Farhad ([[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]]) and fellow con-man Horst ([[Brennan Brown]]). Picking a few pockets as a test, Nicky and Jess develop a romantic relationship, upsetting Nicky, who was taught by his father to never become emotionally involved with any colleagues. At a fictional [[Super Bowl XXVII]], Nicky gets into a round of increasingly extravagant bets with gambler Liyuan Tse ([[B.D. Wong]]), eventually losing all of the money the crew has earned.\n\nTo win it back, Nicky asks Tse to pick any player on or off the field and says that Jess will guess the number picked. A distraught Jess scans the field and sees Farhad wearing jersey number 55, and realizes it is another con. They take Tse for millions of dollars.  Nicky explains to Jess how Tse had been programmed to pick 55 since he arrived, with subtle, subconscious prompts throughout his day. This victory leaves Tse impressed and even graciously gives all the money back to Nicky. Nicky then leaves Jess with her cut, and instructs the driver to take her to the airport.  Jess cries as her limo drives off, as Nicky climbs into another waiting car.\n\nThree years later, Nicky goes to [[Buenos Aires]], working for billionaire motorsport team owner Rafael Garriga ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]). Garriga wants to beat a team headed by Australian businessman McEwen ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) to win the championship. Nicky will pretend to be a disgruntled technician on Garriga's team willing to sell Garriga's custom fuel use algorithm EXR. Instead, he will sell McEwen a bogus version which will slow their car down during the race. At a pre-race party, Nicky runs into Jess, who is now Garriga's girlfriend. After faking heavy drinking upon seeing Jess, Nicky has a convincing fight with Garriga in public and after being thrown out, is recruited by McEwen to provide the component.\n\nNicky begins pursuing Jess again, and they eventually rekindle their relationship. The head of Garriga's security entourage, Owens ([[Gerald McRaney]]), is suspicious and narrowly misses catching the two together. Nicky not only delivers the real component to McEwen for three million [[euro]]s but also sells it to the other teams for similar amounts.\n\nNicky and Jess attempt to return to the US together. However, they are caught by Garriga's men and taken to his garage. Jess is tied up and her mouth is taped shut whilst Nicky is given a beating. Garriga is convinced that Jess had something to do with Nicky gaining access to EXR and begins to suffocate the gagged Jess. To save her, Nicky explains that he gained access to EXR by tricking her into believing he still had feelings for her and that the necklace he had given her was equipped to secretly record Garriga's password and login information. He explains that Jess was conned and knew nothing about this. However, Jess then reveals that she was only trying to seduce Garriga in order to steal [[Piaget SA|his valuable watch]] and to make Nicky jealous.\n\nNicky promises to come clean in order to spare Jess's life but Owens shoots him in the chest, causing a horrified Garriga to leave. Owens then reveals himself to be Nicky's father, Bucky, and assures Jess that he avoided any major arteries. He simply employed the \"Toledo Panic Button\". Bucky then tapes up Nicky's wounds and draws excess blood out of his son's chest with a plunger so that he can breathe. They flee the garage in Garriga's vehicle.\n\nBucky drives Nicky and Jess to the hospital to treat Nicky's punctured lung. Before he drops them off he reveals to Nicky the real reason why he left him on the streets: during a poker deal in Boston he got a gun pulled on him, and all he could think about then was Nicky. He says he then walked away and never looked back. After emphasizing that love will get one killed in the game, Bucky departs with all the money as a reminder of the consequences of losing focus. After he leaves, Nicky notices that Jess snatched Garriga's $200,000 watch before he left the warehouse, and a smiling Nicky and Jess walk towards the hospital entrance together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Nicky Spurgeon\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as Jess Barrett\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Rafael Garriga\n* [[Gerald McRaney]] as Bucky Spurgeon / Owens\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Farhad\n* [[B.
