Demented''''' is a 2000 [[black comedy]] film written and directed by [[John Waters]]. The film stars [[Melanie Griffith]] as a snobby [[A-list]] [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] actress who is kidnapped by a band of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] filmmakers; they force her to star in their [[underground film]]. [[Stephen Dorff]] stars as the eponymous character and leader of the group, with [[Alicia Witt]], [[Adrian Grenier]], [[Michael Shannon]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] co-starring as the rest of his gang of filmmakers.\n\nThe film, whose title (also the name of Dorff's character) alludes to director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], is loosely based on the 1974 kidnapping of [[Patricia Hearst]], who has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]]. Like all of Waters' films, it was shot in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The film was given a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on August 11, 2000, by [[Artisan Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nHollywood [[A-list]] actress Honey Whitlock publicly presents herself as a sweet and considerate woman, but is actually a profane, unreasonable, and demanding [[diva]]. While in Baltimore to attend a [[Film premiere|premiere]], Honey is kidnapped by the manic film director, Cecil B. Demented, and his band of misfit, [[Andy Warhol]]\u2013worshiping artists who have branded themselves \"[[kamikaze]] filmmakers\", going by the group name \"SprocketHoles\". Each of the SprocketHoles has infiltrated the staff of the theater where the premiere is to take place; they subsequently kidnap Honey as she concludes her remarks on stage. In the ensuing mayhem, the group escapes.\n\nHoney is taken to an abandoned movie theater where she is kept gagged with tape on her mouth, tied up and blindfolded. Honey is introduced to Cecil's crew of followers, each of whom wears a tattoo of a noted filmmaker and reveals unique, individual quirks. Cecil explains that he wants to make his masterpiece film and needs Honey to star as the lead. At first she resists, shooting scenes emotionlessly, but when Cecil demands better results, Honey gives an over-the-top performance in the film's opening scene which pleases him. Apart from the first scene, Cecil, Honey and the crew roam around the city filming scenes at real (unapproved) locations, often involving innocent bystanders in the process.\n\nThe group's first location is a movie theater playing ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams: The Director's Cut]]'', which they storm with guns and smoke bombs before leaving with their footage. Several bystanders note in interviews that Honey seems younger and cooler than in her recent Hollywood films, but a spokesman for the Baltimore Film Commission \"says no to cinema terrorism\". Inspired, Cecil decides to invade the luncheon the commission is hosting. The group crashes the event and Cecil orders Honey to jump off the roof of a nearby building, which she does without safety measures. A gunfight ensues between Cecil's crew and the police, during which Rodney the hairdresser is killed and Cecil is wounded. Honey uses the opportunity to turn herself in to the authorities and they take her away in a police car, but the film group retrieves her soon after.\n\nAs Honey seems to become more comfortable with her situation, possibly developing [[Stockholm syndrome]], she watches a [[television special]] discussing her disappearance. Persons who knew her, including her ex-husband, are interviewed and come clean about how mean-spirited she was in daily life. Honey now realizes that her desire to escape would only lead her back to Hollywood, where she is hated for being rude. She resists the idea of joining Cecil's followers but soon reconsiders and declares herself \"Demented forever\", burning a brand into her arm and officially joining the motley crew.\n\nThe SprocketHoles then invade the set of the ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' sequel being filmed in Baltimore, at Honey's suggestion. Upon arrival, they subdue and replace many of the film's crew. A gunfight breaks out between Cecil's friends and [[Teamsters]] who got free. Members of Cecil's crew are either killed or wounded. The surviving SprocketHoles and Honey flee to a nearby pornographic theater and seek refuge inside. The audience helps Cecil escape.\n\nAt their last location, Cecil is shooting the final scene at a local drive-in while law enforcement are alerted. Cecil and the crew invade the projection room, and he proceeds to excite the crowd into a frenzy. He asks Honey to light her hair on fire for the final shot (which she does). With the film finished, the SprocketHoles start having sex in public before the authorities step in. Cecil sets himself completely ablaze as police arrive, to give Honey a chance to escape. In the ensuing chaos, some crew members escape with the raw film footage while others are shot. Taken into custody, she is surprised and pleased by the new affection that the crowd has shown to her as she is put into the police van.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Honey Whitlock\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Sinclair Stevens / Cecil B.
