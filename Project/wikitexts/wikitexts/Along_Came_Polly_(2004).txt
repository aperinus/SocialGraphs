The story follows Reuben Feffer who finds his life taking a different turn when he reconnects and falls in love with his old classmate, Polly. Chaos ensues when his former wife, Lisa, returns to reconcile with him.\n\nThe film was released on January 16, 2004. It received mixed reviews and grossed $178 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nReuben Feffer, a risk-adverse [[actuary]] for a large [[life insurance]] company, is celebrating his [[honeymoon]] with his new wife, Lisa Kramer, on the island of [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|St. Barts]], but catches her having sex with Claude, a [[French people|French]] scuba instructor. Returning home to New York alone, he attempts to piece his life back together. Reuben goes to an art gallery with his friend, Sandy Lyle, where he runs into former [[Middle school|junior high school]] classmate Polly Prince.\n\nReuben and Polly begin dating. She introduces him to activities he once wrote off as \"too risky\". This includes eating at a [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] restaurant, which ends badly due to Reuben's [[irritable bowel syndrome]]. Luckily, Polly gives him a second chance where they end up [[salsa dancing]] and later enthusiastically having sex, with Reuben shouting \"50\" at the climax.\n\nThe contrast between their two personalities is a source of comedy until Lisa returns and tells him she wants to reconcile. Meanwhile, Sandy, a self-centered, former [[teen idol]], is trying to make a comeback by having an ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' filmed about his life while starring as Judas in an amateur production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.\n\nReuben is torn between the free spirited Polly and the safe and familiar Lisa. To solve this issue, he enters information about them both into a computer insurance program which measures risk, but tilts the program towards Polly. The computer tells him that, despite his numerous blunders with her, she is the least risky choice for Reuben.\n\nPolly joins Reuben on a [[sailing]] trip where he is to inspect Leland Van Lew, a high risk client, but she is offended when she sees his risk analysis of her. She rejects his proposal to move in together, telling him that he would be better off going back to Lisa. Back home, Reuben tries talking to Polly, but to no avail. He eventually invites Lisa to Sandy's opening show, where he learns that Polly is leaving New York in a few hours.\n\nAfter a speech given by his father, Irving, to Sandy about not living in the past, Reuben realizes he wants to be with Polly and not Lisa, and he rushes to her apartment to stop her from leaving. Meanwhile, Sandy fills in for Reuben for his risk analysis presentation on Leland and successfully grants him his insurance.\n\nReuben eventually catches up with Polly and tries to persuade her to stay. She is not convinced she should stay with him, so he eats food off the ground to prove he is capable of taking risks. Polly is finally convinced and ends up dating Reuben, but they both agree they will take their relationship step-by-step and not rush into marriage.\n\nReuben and Polly [[vacation]] on the same beach where he and Lisa had their honeymoon. Reuben again encounters Claude, but instead of being angry, he thanks him for showing the ugly truth about Lisa before heading nude into the water with Polly to join Leland on his new boat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Reuben Feffer\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Polly Prince\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Lisa Kramer\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Sandford \"Sandy\" Lyle\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Stanley \"Stan\" Indursky\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Claude\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Roxanne\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Leland Van Lew\n* [[Jsu Garcia]] as Javier\n* [[Michele Lee]] as Vivian Feffer\n* [[Bob Dishy]] as Irving Feffer\n* [[Masi Oka]] as Wonsuk\n* [[Judah Friedlander]] as Dustin\n* [[Kym Whitley]] as Gladys \n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Vic\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] as the Catering Manager\n* [[Todd Stashwick]] as the Security Officer\n* [[Christine Barger]] as the JCS Singer/Mary Magdalene\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at #1 at the [[box office]] in the United States, earning [[US$]]27,721,185 in its opening weekend, ending the month long reign of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title='Along Came Polly' ...
