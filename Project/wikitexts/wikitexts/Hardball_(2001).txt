B. Sweeney]]. The screenplay by [[John Gatins]] is based on the book ''Hardball: A Season in the Projects'' by Daniel Coyle. The original music score is composed by [[Mark Isham]]. The film was released on September 14, 2001, topping the box office the weekend after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==Plot==\nConor O'Neill is a gambler who secretly bets $6,000 on his dead father's account and is now severely in debt with two bookies. In order to repay the debts, he is told by a corporate friend that he must coach a [[baseball]] team of troubled African-American fifth grade kids from Chicago's [[ABLA]] housing projects in exchange for $500 each week, for ten weeks.\n\nWorried only about getting his $500 check, Conor shows up at the baseball field to a rag tag bunch of trash-talking, street-wise, inner city kids who live in the projects. Some of the players include: Andre Ray Peetes, a smart-mouthed jokester, captain of the team who knows about all the players and forms a strong bond with Conor; Kofi Evans, a troubled, angry boy who has a rivalry with Andre, a quick temper, but is the best player on the team; Jefferson Albert Tibbs, a sweet, overweight, asthmatic player; Jamal, Andre's best friend and the oldest on the team; Miles Penfield II, the brilliant pitcher who listens to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]\u2019s [[Big Poppa]] to pitch well; and Jarius \"G-Baby\" Evans, Kofi's much younger brother who is too young to play so he becomes Conor's assistant.\n\nConor's efforts are hindered from the onset by the fact that he does not have nine kids to make up the team\u2014Jamal\u2019s mother altered his birth certificate to be younger and G-Baby is sad because he is far too young to play. The older kids tell Conor it is because their teacher, Elizabeth \"Sister\" Wilkes, is making several boys finish a book report. Conor visits the teacher, but his life is threatened repeatedly by his bookies for not paying his gambling debts. He is visited by the mother of two boys and her sister's son that are allowed to play in exchange for his tutoring them.\n\nConor works to get the team to support each other and stop trash-talking each other's bad plays; but the team nevertheless loses its first game 16\u20131, which fosters hostility between the players. Conor brings them together by buying them pizza (trading sports tickets for the pizza) and leads the team to win their second game 9\u20133. The team starts to come together as Conor tries to kindle a romance with Wilkes.\n\nConor risks everything and makes a $12,000 bet with a new bookie to cover the $12,000 debt he owes to the other bookies. His stress, already high from his gambling debts, runs higher at the baseball field because Jamal is pulled from playing after a competing coach questions the boy's age and Myles can't wear headphones while he pitches. Conor takes offense to the league president's threat to be removed, after he voices his objection to his team having to wear ratty T-shirts while the other teams have full uniforms. In protest, he announces it was his last game which draws dissension and resentment from his players.\n\nConor barely wins his $12,000 bet, pays off all his debts, and refuses to turn that bet for $24,000 using the winnings. Conor connects with the kids and finds it harder to leave than he thought. He surprises them with second row seats (behind [[Sammy Sosa]]'s dugout) to a major league game. He stops gambling; his relationship with Wilkes grows; he gets new uniforms for the players (sponsored by one of his bookies); and he assumes a fatherly role in leading the team to the championship game (called \"going to the 'ship\" by the boys).\n\nJust after Conor drops the kids off at home after winning the pre-championship game, G-Baby is struck and killed by a stray bullet and Kofi has to hold him as he dies. Conor wants to forfeit the game, but Andre and especially Kofi, rallies the team together. The end credits show the kids finally getting the trophies they wanted after winning the championship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Conor O'Neill\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Elizabeth Wilkes\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as \"Ticky\" Tobin\n* Bryan C.
