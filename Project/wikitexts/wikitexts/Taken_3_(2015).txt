It is the third and final installment in the [[Taken (franchise)|''Taken'' trilogy]]. A co-production between France, Spain and the United States, the film stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Maggie Grace]] and [[Famke Janssen]].\n\nThe film was released in Germany in late 2014, and then in the United States on 9 January 2015 by [[20th Century Fox]] and in France on 21 January 2015 by [[EuropaCorp Distribution]]. It grossed $326 million worldwide, but received generally unfavorable reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nRetired [[CIA]] officer Bryan Mills, visits his daughter, Kim, to deliver an early birthday gift. After an awkward visit, he invites his former wife, Lenore, to dinner. Although she declines, she later shows up at his apartment and tells him about her marital problems, but says she wants to make it work. Later, her husband, Stuart, tells Bryan never to see his wife again. Stuart secretly uses Bryan's phone to arrange a meeting with Lenore, making it appear that Bryan sent it and then deletes the message afterwards. Lenore is kidnapped when she arrives for the bogus meeting.\n\nThe next morning, Bryan receives a text from Lenore asking to meet for breakfast. When Bryan returns home, he discovers Lenore's body. Two [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers immediately appear to arrest him, but Bryan subdues two officers, leads other officers on a chase through the neighborhood, disappears into the sewer system, and escapes. Meanwhile, LAPD Detective Frank Dotzler reviews Bryan's background.\n\nBryan retreats to a [[safe house]] equipped with weapons and surveillance electronics. He retraces Lenore's final movements to a gas station and obtains the [[closed-circuit television|surveillance footage]] showing her being abducted by men with distinctive hand [[tattoo]]s. LAPD detectives arrive to arrest him, but Bryan hijacks the [[police cruiser]] and downloads phone records from an LAPD database onto a [[USB flash drive|thumb drive]]. He contacts Kim at Lenore's funeral via a camera hidden in his friend Sam's suit, and instructs her to maintain her \"very predictable schedule.\" Bryan arranges to meet with her later and removes a surveillance bug, which Dotzler planted on her. Kim tells Bryan that she is pregnant, and that Stuart is acting scared and has hired bodyguards.\n\nBryan chases Stuart's car, but a pursuing SUV ambushes him, forcing his car over a cliff. Bryan survives, hijacks another car, and follows the attackers to a roadside liquor store. Bryan kills the men, then abducts and interrogates Stuart using [[waterboarding]]. Stuart confesses that his former business partner and ex-Russian [[Spetsnaz]] operator, Oleg Malankov, murdered Lenore because Stuart owes him money; Stuart exposed Bryan's identity to Malankov out of jealousy.\n\nWith assistance from his old colleagues and a nervous Stuart, Bryan gains entry to Malankov's heavily secured penthouse. After Bryan kills Malankov's guards and fights Malankov, a mortally-wounded Malankov reveals that Stuart planned Lenore's murder and framed Bryan as part of a business deal to collect a $12,000,000 life insurance policy. Malankov adds that when Stuart failed to kill Bryan, he used Bryan to try and kill Malankov so Stuart could keep the insurance money.\n\nMeanwhile, Stuart abducts Kim, intending to flee with the money. Under police pursuit, Bryan arrives at the airport in Malankov's Porsche as Stuart's private plane is preparing for takeoff. After destroying the landing gear with the Porsche, Bryan overpowers Stuart. Heeding Kim's pleas, Bryan refrains from killing Stuart, but warns him to expect retribution if he escapes justice or receives a reduced prison sentence. Dotzler and the LAPD arrive and arrest Stuart while Bryan is cleared.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kim tells Bryan she wants to name her baby after her mother if it's a girl.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div
