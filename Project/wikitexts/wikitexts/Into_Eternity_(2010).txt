Director Michael Madsen questions Onkalo's intended eternal existence, addressing an audience in the remote future.\n\n''Into Eternity'' raises the question of the authorities' responsibility of ensuring compliance with relatively new safety criteria legislation and the principles at the core of [[nuclear waste management]].<ref>Variety, {{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:iEPQnQG1E3sJ:www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1987/en19870990.pdf+nuclear+energy+act+finland&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiVjxypge3_4tl6taBsMZS9C3hkkPNu3AVN_VZNb8WPCj5d9tjOMtmCg3leGlbOheUwPFxnDH0MkAG1U7VEW_ualQ_TcfvuSI9j1ctaJwPFuLZa3leofIUa9cNCWo9ez1XnuXjj&sig=AHIEtbQV4hF__OPYM1-RXPHUBk87WGoG_w |title=Finland Nuclear Energy Act (1987) | accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhen shown on the British [[More4]] digital television channel on 26 April 2011, the name '''''Nuclear Eternity''''' was used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/nuclear-eternity |title=Nuclear Eternity |work=More4 |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> It received a special mention in the Sheffield Green Award at [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]] in 2010.\n\n==Background==\n''Into Eternity'' is a documentary about a [[deep geological repository]] for [[nuclear waste]]. The concept of long-term underground storage for radioactive waste has been explored since the 1950s. The inner part of the [[Matryoshka doll|Russian doll]]-like storage canisters is to be composed of [[copper]]. Hence in the case of Onkalo it is tightly linked to experiments on copper corrosion in running [[groundwater]] flow.\n\nApplication for the implementation of [[spent nuclear fuel]] repository was submitted by [[Posiva]] in 2001. The excavation itself started in 2004. With a total of four operable [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactors]] providing 25% of the country's energy supply, [[Finland]] ranks 16th in the world nuclear power reactors country list topped by the [[United States]] (104 reactors) and [[France]] (58 reactors).{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThis film explores the question of preparing the site so that it is not disturbed for 100,000 years, even though no [[List of oldest known surviving buildings|structure in human history]] has stayed standing for such a long period.\n\n{{blockquote|Every day, the world over, large amounts of high-level [[radioactive waste]] created by [[nuclear power]] plants are placed in interim storage, which is vulnerable to [[natural disaster]]s, [[man-made disasters]], and societal changes. In Finland, the world\u2019s first permanent repository is being hewn out of solid rock \u2013 a huge system of [[tunnel]]s \u2013 that must last the entire period the waste remains [[Hazardous waste|hazardous]]: 100,000 years.\n\nOnce the repository waste has been deposited and is full, the facility is to be sealed off and never opened again. Or so we hope, but can we ensure that? And how is it possible to [[long-time nuclear waste warning messages|warn our descendants]] of the deadly waste we left behind? How do we prevent them from thinking they have found the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] of our time, mystical burial grounds, hidden treasures? Which languages and signs will they understand? And if they understand, will they respect our instructions?\n\nExperts above ground strive to find solutions to this crucially important radioactive waste issue to secure mankind and all species on planet Earth now and in the near and very distant future.}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received overall positive reviews from Swedish film critics, with an average score of 3.6 of 5 according to Kritiker.se.<ref>''Kritiker.se'', [http://kritiker.se/film/recension/?film=Michael_Madsen__-__Into_Eternity Into Eternity]; based on 7 reviews.</ref> Praise was given for the suggestive presentation of the daunting task of communicating the dangers of nuclear waste far into the future, as well as the great dangers of handling the by-products of nuclear energy.<ref>Gentele, Jeanette, \"Into Eternity\" [http://www.svd.se/kultur/film/filmrecension-into-eternity_5240773.svd].
