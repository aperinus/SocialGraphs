It featured [[David Tennant]] as British scientist Sir [[Arthur Eddington|Arthur Stanley Eddington]], and [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Albert Einstein]]. This is the story of Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]], his relationship with Eddington and the introduction of this theory to the world, against the backdrop of the [[World War I|Great War]] and [[Eddington experiment|Eddington's eclipse observations]].\n\nIt was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 22 November 2008.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ft62c BBC website for ''Einstein and Eddington'']</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe prelude is set in 1919 on [[Eddington experiment|Eddington's expedition]] in [[Pr\u00edncipe]] to observe the [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse that year]], before moving back in time to 1914. At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], Eddington is appointed chief astronomer at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] by [[Sir Oliver Lodge]] and instructed to research Einstein's work and defend the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian status quo]]. Meanwhile, Einstein is lured back from [[Z\u00fcrich]] to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin in an attempt to aid the war effort by embarrassing Britain by disproving the work of its great scientist [[Isaac Newton]]. In Berlin, with his marriage already under tension, Einstein falls in love with his cousin [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa]].\n\nA [[Quaker]] and therefore unable to go to war, Eddington sets out to bid farewell to his love interest William Marston, as the latter goes off to war as an officer, but just misses Marston's train. He then presents his lecture to his fellow astronomers at the university \u2014 defending Newton, but still thinking Einstein might be right \u2014 and takes the German M\u00fcller family into his home after saving them from a violent anti-German mob. When Einstein's wife arrives in Berlin, she discovers Einstein's affair and leaves him, whilst Eddington faces down protesters who despise his status as a [[conscientious objector]]. Einstein arrives late at a demonstration of Fritz Haber's [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] and is so disgusted by this application of science to murder that he rejects an offer to convert his citizenship back from Swiss to German and refuses to sign the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three|\"Manifesto to the Civilized World\"]], a list of prominent German scientists, artists and academics supporting the war.\n\n{{see also|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nEddington finds his research into Einstein's work obstructed by a British ban on the circulation of German scientific literature. Realising that [[Mercury (planet)#Orbit, rotation, and longitude|Mercury's orbit]] is precessing slightly less than it should be according to [[Newton's laws]], he writes to Einstein despite the ban to inquire into his view on the problem. Einstein's relationship with Elsa deepens, and on receiving Eddington's letter he starts work on this new avenue with [[Max Planck]], whilst consoling colleague Planck on the loss of his son in the war despite Einstein's lack of belief in a [[Personal god|human-like God]] or an afterlife. They find that Einstein's work agrees with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit where Newton's does not, and send this reply back to Eddington.\n\nAt the same time, Eddington grieves over Marston, among the 15,000 killed by German use of [[chlorine]] gas at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], causing doubts in his faith, but leading him to fight all the more loudly against an expulsion of German scientists from the [[Royal Society]]. The expulsion has been initiated by Lodge, whose son was also among the killed and who clings to Newton as a consolation of \"order in the universe\", but Eddington is unable to admit to Lodge that he too is grieving for a loved one.\n\nNews of the gas attack also leads Einstein to an outburst against his fellow scientists, which leads to his being cut off from the university, and \u2014 overworking \u2014 he falls sick and Elsa leaves him. Even so, he manages to complete his work on [[general relativity]] and on [[Gravitational lensing|how starlight bends]] and gets this result through to Eddington via Planck. Eddington realises he can prove that space and light are being bent by observing the [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]] on the west African island of [[Pr\u00edncipe]], and with Dyson as an ally, manages to gain funding for his expedition, despite Lodge's initial opposition. As the war ends, Eddington's sister and housekeeper, Winifred, sets off to help the [[Quaker]] relief effort in war-shattered Germany despite her fears as to Eddington's waning faith.\n\nThe action returns to the Pr\u00edncipe expedition, delayed by bad weather until the last moment, while Einstein briefly returns to his ex-wife and children. Bringing back two photographs from the eclipse to compare to photographs of the night sky in normal conditions, Eddington compares them in public, with Lodge and Winifred in attendance, and not only proves Einstein right but also finds this confirmation reaffirming his faith \u2014 as he states, \"I can hear God, thinking\". News of his vindication reaches Einstein, and crowds of press arrive at his door just as Elsa returns to him.  A year later, in the closing scene, Einstein visits Cambridge and meets Eddington. The closing credits remark on both scientists' later work, Einstein's celebrity and Eddington's obscurity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Germany===\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Albert Einstein]]\n* [[Lucy Cohu]] as [[Mileva Einstein]]\n* [[Jodhi May]] as [[Elsa Einstein]]\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as [[Max Planck]]\n* Callum Williams as [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Einstein]]\n* Jacob Th\u00e9ato as [[Einstein family#Eduard \"Tete\" Einstein (Albert's second son)|Eduard Einstein]]\n* [[Anton Lesser]] as [[Fritz Haber]]\n* [[John Bowe (actor)|John Bowe]] as [[Leopold Koppel]]\n* [[Kika Markham]] as Aunt Fanny\n* [[Philip Whitchurch]] as Uncle Rudolf\n\n[[File:Andy Serkis 2003.jpg|thumb|upright|left|180px|[[Andy Serkis]] ([[Albert Einstein]])]]\n\n===Britain===\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]]\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[Sir Oliver Lodge]]\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Winnifred Eddington, Arthur's Sister\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as [[Frank Watson Dyson]]\n* [[Lucy Briers]] as The Librarian\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as H.H.
