Nagra and Knightley were hired soon after, with casting rounded out with the additions of Meyers, Kher, Stevenson, Lewis, and Panjabi by that May. [[Principal photography]] began in June 2001 and lasted until that September, with filming locations including [[London]], [[Shepperton Studios]], and [[Hamburg]].

Jess is infatuated with football, but her parents do not support her interest. However, she sometimes plays in the park with boys, including her best friend, Tony, who is gay although her family thinks he has his eye on her. Her family is occupied with planning for Jess's sister Pinky's imminent wedding.\n\nJules Paxton, a member of the Hounslow Harriers, a local women's amateur football team, notices Jess's football skills, befriends her, and invites her to try out for the team. The coach, Joe\u2014a young Irish former player whose own career was derailed by injuries\u2014accepts her onto the team. Although Jess's parents forbid her to join the team, she plays behind their backs, claiming to have a part-time job when she is actually at football practice. When he learns that Jess is on the team without her parents' permission, Joe pleads with Mr. Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but he refuses, revealing that he does not want Jess to suffer the way he did when he was excluded from a cricket club because of [[anti-Indian sentiment]].\n\nWith Pinky covering for her, Jess travels with the team to play a match in [[Germany]]; the Harriers lose the match after Jess fails to score on a [[penalty kick]]. When they go out [[Clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]] in [[Hamburg]] after the match, Jules catches Joe and Jess about to kiss. This sours the two girls' friendship, as Jules also is attracted to Joe. Furthermore, Jess's parents find out she is still on the team by seeing a newspaper article about the Hamburg match. After returning, Jess goes to Jules's house to try to patch up their friendship, but Jules's mother, confused by overhearing only parts of an argument, thinks they are hiding a [[lesbian]] relationship.\n\nJess's father secretly attends one of her games, and sees Jess mocked with a racial slur by an opposing player, and Joe hugging her afterward to comfort her. The Harriers qualify for the finals of the league tournament, but the championship match\u2014with an American [[talent scout]] in attendance\u2014is to be held on the same day as Pinky's wedding, so Jess resigns herself to missing the game. At Pinky's wedding Jess is visibly miserable; her father tells her to go to the game so she can be happy on her sister's wedding day. The Harriers are behind 1\u20130 when Jess arrives, but they rally, and eventually Jess wins the game with a free kick. The scout offers Jess and Jules [[Athletic scholarship|sports scholarships]] at [[Santa Clara University]] in [[California]]. Jules and Jess share a hug and kiss to celebrate, furthering Jules's mother's suspicions. Jess returns to the wedding, now able to celebrate. Jules's mother gives Jules a ride to the wedding as well, but when they arrive, Mrs. Paxton accuses Jess of being a hypocrite and a lesbian. Jules drags her mother away, angrily clarifying her relationship with Jess.\n\nLater that day, Jess has still not told her parents about the scholarship; she is afraid they might not allow her to go to the United States on her own. Tony, out of friendship for Jess, decides to lie to the family and tell them he is engaged to Jess as long as she gets to go to any college she wants. The Bhamras happily accept, but Jess immediately confesses the truth. Jess's mother ignores Jess's heartfelt speech and scolds Jess's father for letting Jess leave Pinky's wedding. But her father announces he doesn't want Jess to suffer as he did, and accepts her desire to play football. Jess runs to the football field to tell Joe of her parents' decision. The two almost kiss, but Jess pulls away, saying her parents would object, and that although they had come far enough to let her go to America to play, she doesn't think they would be able to handle another cultural rebellion from her.\n\nOn the day of Jess and Jules's flight to America, the two are about to board the plane when Joe arrives and confesses his love for Jess. The two kiss and Jess agrees to sort out their relationship (and her parents) when she returns for Christmas. While at the airport, they see [[David Beckham]] with his wife [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria]], which Jules takes as a sign. Then the two leave through the gate giving happy waves to their families.\n\nWhile Jess and Jules are away, Mr and Mrs. Paxton patch up their relationship, Pinky becomes pregnant and Mr. Bhamra gets back into playing cricket with Joe.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as Jesminder \"Jess\" Kaur Bhamra\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Juliette \"Jules\" Paxton\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as \"Pinky\" Kaur Bhamra\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Joe\n* [[Shaznay Lewis]] as Marlena \"Mel\" Goines\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Mohaan Singh Bhamra\n* [[Shaheen Khan (British actress)|Shaheen Khan]] as Mrs \"Sukhi\" Kaur Bhamra\n* [[Frank Harper]] as Alan Paxton\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Paula Paxton\n* [[Ameet Chana]] as Tony\n* [[Kulvinder Ghir]] as Teetu\n* Ash Varrez as Teetu's dad\n* [[Pooja Shah]] as Meena\n* [[Preeya Kalidas]] as Monica\n* [[Trey Farley]] as Taz\n* [[Zohra Sehgal]] as Biji\n* Saraj Chaudhry as Sonny\n* Paven Virk as Bubbly\n* Emma Daly as team player\n* [[Nina Wadia]] as Wedding Caterer\n* [[Ace Bhatti]] as Nairobi Grandson\n* [[Gary Lineker]] as himself\n* [[Alan Hansen]] as himself\n* [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] as himself\n}}\n\n==Production==\nGurinder Chadha co-wrote the script with Guljit Bindra and screenwriting partner Paul Mayeda Berges.
