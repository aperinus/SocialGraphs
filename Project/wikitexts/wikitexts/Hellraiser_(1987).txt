The [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|leader of the Cenobites]] is portrayed by [[Doug Bradley]], and identified in the sequels as \"Pinhead\".\n\n''Hellraiser'' was filmed in late 1986. Barker originally wanted the electronic music group [[Coil (band)|Coil]] to perform the music for the film, but on insistence from producers, the film was re-scored by [[Christopher Young]]. Some of Coil's themes were reworked by Young into the final score. ''Hellraiser'' had its first public showing at the [[Prince Charles Cinema]] on 10 September 1987. The film grossed $14.6 million.\n\nSince its release, the film has divided critics but generally received praise; initial reviews ranged from ''[[Melody Maker]]'' calling it the greatest horror film made in Britain, to [[Roger Ebert]] decrying its \"bankruptcy of imagination\". It was followed by [[Hellraiser (franchise)#Films|nine sequels]], the first seven of which featured Bradley reprising his role as Pinhead. A franchise reboot, also titled [[Hellraiser (2022 film)|''Hellraiser'']], was released in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. Please do not exceed this count without discussion at the Talk page. -->\nIn Morocco, Frank Cotton, a [[Hedonism|hedonist]], buys a [[puzzle box]] said to open the door to a realm of otherworldly pleasure. At home in his bare attic, Frank solves the puzzle and hooked chains emerge, tearing him apart. [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|A black-robed figure]] resets the puzzle and the room is restored back to normal.\n\nLater, Frank's brother Larry moves into the same house. He intends to rebuild his relationship with his second wife, Julia. Larry is unaware that Julia had an affair with Frank before her marriage to him. When Larry accidentally cuts his hand moving furniture, his blood drips on the attic floor and resurrects Frank in a ghoulish form. Julia later finds Frank; still obsessed with him, she agrees to help restore his body so they can run away together. Julia picks up men in bars and brings them back to the attic, where she mortally wounds them. Frank then drains their life which regenerates his body. Frank explains to Julia that, having exhausted all sensory experiences, he sought out the puzzle box, which was supposed to provide access to a realm of new carnal pleasures. When the puzzle was solved, the \"[[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites]]\" came to subject him to extreme [[sadomasochism]].\n\n[[Kirsty (Hellraiser)|Kirsty]], Larry's teenage daughter, sees Julia bringing a man to the house and follows her to the attic, where she finds Frank. She evades Frank and escapes with the puzzle box, collapsing shortly after. Awakening in a hospital, Kirsty solves the box out of curiosity, and unknowningly summons the Cenobites and a monster called the [[List of Hellraiser characters#Engineer|Engineer]], which she narrowly escapes from. The Cenobites' leader (referred to by fans as \"Pinhead\") explains that although they have been perceived as both [[angel]]s and [[demon]]s, they are simply \"explorers\" from another dimension seeking carnal experiences, and they can no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure. When they attempt to force Kirsty to return to their realm with them, she informs Pinhead that Frank has escaped them. The Cenobites agree to spare Kirsty and re-capture Frank instead, with the condition that Frank must confess to escaping them.\n\nKirsty returns home, where Frank has killed Larry and has taken on his identity by wearing his skin. Julia shows her what is purported to be Frank's flayed corpse in the attic. Kirsty then leaves the attic, locking the door behind her. The Cenobites appear and, not fooled by the deception, demand the man who \"did this\". Kirsty tries to escape but is held by Julia and Frank. Frank reveals his true identity to Kirsty and, when his sexual advances are rejected, he decides to kill her to complete his rejuvenation. He accidentally stabs Julia instead and drains her without remorse. Frank chases Kirsty to the attic and, when he is about to kill her, the Cenobites appear after hearing him confess to killing her father. Now certain he is the one they are looking for, they ensnare him with chains with hooks and tear him to pieces. Ripping the puzzle box from Julia's dead hands, Kirsty banishes the Cenobites by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box. Kirsty's boyfriend Steve arrives and they both escape the collapsing house.\n\nAfterward, Kirsty throws the puzzle box onto a burning pyre. A vagrant who has been stalking Kirsty walks into the fire and retrieves the box before transforming into a winged skeleton-like creature and flying away. The box ends up with the same merchant who sold it to Frank, where he offers it to another customer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clare Higgins]] as Julia Cotton\n* [[Ashley Laurence]] as [[Kirsty (Hellraiser)|Kirsty Cotton]]\n* [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]] as Larry Cotton\n* [[Sean Chapman]] as Frank Cotton\n* Robert Hines as Steve\n* [[Doug Bradley]] as [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Lead Cenobite]]{{refn|name=Note|group=Note|Later identified as \"Pinhead\" in the credits for the sequels beginning with ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'' (1988), \"The Hell Priest\" in ''[[The Scarlet Gospels]]'' (2015), and \"The Cold Man\" in ''[[Hellraiser: The Toll]]'' (2018).}}\n* [[Nicholas Vince]] as [[Chatterer|Chattering Cenobite]]\n* [[Simon Bamford]] as Butterball Cenobite\n* [[Grace Kirby]] as Female Cenobite\n* [[Oliver Smith (actor)|Oliver Smith]] as \"Skinless\" Frank / Frank the Monster\n\n==Cenobites==\nCenobites are extra-dimensional beings who appear in the novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]'', the sequels ''[[The Scarlet Gospels]]'' and ''[[Hellraiser: The Toll]]'', and the eleven [[Hellraiser (film series)|''Hellraiser'' films]].

The cast treated my ineptitudes kindly, and the crew were no less forgiving\". Barker admitted his own lack of knowledge on filmmaking, stating that he \"didn't know the difference between a 10-millimetre lens and a 35-millimetre lens. If you'd shown me a plate of spaghetti and said that was a lens, I might have believed you\".{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=23}} After filming, New World convinced Barker to relocate the story to the United States which required overdubbing to remove some English accents.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\nDuring production, [[Doug Bradley]] had trouble hitting his marks during his takes in make-up as he could not see through his black contact lenses and was afraid of tripping over Pinhead's skirts.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=23}} The special effects of the unnamed creature, known as \"The Engineer\" in the novels, proved challenging as the creature was difficult to manoeuvre.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}} Other issues included a rushed shoot of the Chinese restaurant scene with Kirsty and Larry, due to the lateness of the person responsible for letting the cast and crew into the establishment.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}} Numerous props of Lemarchand's box, constructed from wood and cut-out brass, were produced by special effects designer and maker Simon Sayce; due to the box's delicate construction, Sayce would lie on the floor under the Cenobites during some takes in case it was dropped, in order to save himself the eight hours it took to create another.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100 Greatest Props in Movie History, and the Stories Behind Them |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/greatest-movie-props |website=thrillist.com |publisher=Thrillist |access-date=31 January 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170711191009/https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/greatest-movie-props |archive-date=11 July 2017 |date=10 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film had two editors: Richard Marden<ref name=\"guardian\" /> and an uncredited [[Tony Randel]].{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}}\n\n==Censorship==\nClive Barker had to make some cuts on the film after the MPAA originally gave it an X rating.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> Two and a half shots were excised from the first hammer murder, including a closeup of the hammer lodged in the victim's head. In the scene where Julia murders another man, the actor playing the victim felt that it made sense for him to do so naked. The nude murder scene was shot but, ultimately, replaced with a semi-clothed version. Close-ups of Kirsty sticking her hand into Frank's stomach, exposing his guts, a longer version of the scene where Frank is being torn into pieces, and the final shot where his head explodes were also cut.<ref name=\"io9\" />\n\nIn an interview for ''[[Samhain (magazine)|Samhain]]'' magazine in July 1987, Barker mentioned some problems that censors had with more erotic scenes in the film:\n\n{{bquote|Well, we did have a slight problem with the eroticism. I shot a much hotter flashback sequence than they would allow us to cut in.... Mine was more explicit and less violent. They wanted to substitute one kind of undertow for another. I had a much more explicit sexual encounter between Frank and Julia, but they said no, let's take out the sodomy and put in the flick knife.}}\n\nBarker also said that the seduction scene between Julia and Frank was initially a lot more explicit: \"We did a version of this scene which had some spanking in it and the MPAA was not very appreciative of that. Lord knows where the spanking footage is. Somebody has it somewhere ... The MPAA told me I was allowed two consecutive buttock thrusts from Frank but three is deemed obscene!\"<ref name=\"io9\">{{Cite news|url=http://io9.com/all-the-weirdest-secrets-you-never-knew-about-clive-bar-1650487166|title=All the Weirdest Secrets You Never Knew About Clive Barker's Hellraiser|newspaper=Gizmodo |date=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Hellraiser\n| type         = film\n| artist       = [[Christopher Young]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|df=yes|1987\n|}}\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = \n| length       = {{Duration|m=42|s=40}}\n| label        = Silva Screen<ref name=\"sleeve-vinyl\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Hellraiser |others=[[Christopher Young]] |year=1987 |publisher=[[Silva Screen]] |id=FILM 021}}</ref>\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nBarker originally wanted the electronic music group [[Coil (band)|Coil]] to perform the music for the film, but that notion was rejected by New World.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}} Editor Tony Randel then suggested [[Christopher Young]] as a replacement for Coil for the film's score.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}} Young had previously composed scores for other horror films such as the 1985 slasher ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' and the 1986 [[Tobe Hooper]] film ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Kane|2015|p=24}}\n\nThe score for ''Hellraiser'' was released in 1987.<ref name=\"allmusic-hellraiser\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hellraiser-original-soundtrack-mw0000651578|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Hellraiser [Original Soundtrack]|access-date=4 October 2015|last=Ruhlmann|first=William}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] stated that the score proved that Christopher Young \"hadn't used up all of his ideas for the horror genre\" and that Young had matched \"Barker's stylish look with a gothic score that mixed in exciting synthesizer effects\".<ref name=\"allmusic-hellraiser\" /> The music that Coil had recorded as a demo for their version of the score was later released as ''[[The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser]]''.\n\n==Release==\n''Hellraiser'' had its first public showing at the [[Prince Charles Cinema]] on 10 September 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/hr1twentieth.html|publisher=The Official Clive Barker website|title=Hellraiser - 20th Anniversary|access-date=2017-09-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on 18 September;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://allmovie.com/movie/hellraiser-v22114|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|title=Hellraiser|first=Cavett|last=Binion|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> it grossed $14,564,000 in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"numbers\"/><ref name=\"mojo\"/> It made \u00a3763,412 in the UK.<ref name=\"org\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-back-to-the-future-the-fall-and-rise-of-the-british-film-industry-in-the-1980s.pdf|page=23|title=Back to the Future: The Fall and Rise of the British Film Industry in the 1980s - An Information Briefing|website=British Film Institute|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n''Hellraiser'' was initially banned in [[Ontario]] by the Ontario Film and Video Review Board.<ref name=\"ts-ban2\">{{cite news|title=Censors burn Hellraiser; Paramount chops Eddie's Cop|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|page=E10|date=17 July 1987|location=Toronto|issn=0319-0781|author=Schwartzberg, Shlomo}}</ref><ref name=\"ts-ban\">{{cite news|title=Censors uphold ban on Hellraiser|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|page=H5|date=30 July 1987|location=Toronto|issn=0319-0781}}</ref> By a 3-2 majority vote, the film was deemed \"not approved in its entirety as it contravenes community standards\".

However, various Blu-ray releases have since emerged with a highly variable selection of special features, although most of these are recycled from previous DVD releases.<ref>[http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=537 Rewind @ www.dvdcompare.net \u2013 Hellraiser AKA Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cenobite.com/collect/video.htm The Hellbound Web | Collectibles | Video Recordings<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116163334/http://www.cenobite.com/collect/video.htm |date=16 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2015, [[Arrow Films]] released the film on Blu-ray in the UK along with ''Hellbound: Hellraiser'' II and ''Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth'' in a Scarlet Box edition featuring new 2K restorations and extensive list of bonus features including feature-length documentaries on the first 2 films and a bonus disc containing additional content such as 2 short films by Clive Barker.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0117WYPPKM]{{dead link|date=July 2022}}</ref> The Scarlet Box is now out of print in the UK and replaced by a 3-film edition of the set without the bonus disc.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hellraiser-Trilogy-Blu-Ray-Doug-Bradley/dp/B017MIMPA0/ | title=Hellraiser Trilogy | website=Amazon UK }}</ref>\n\nA US version of the Scarlet Box (with the same material) was released by Arrow on 20 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hellraiser-Scarlet-Limited-Trilogy-Blu-ray/dp/B01M219QJ6|title = Hellraiser: The Scarlet Box Trilogy Region A|website = Amazon|date = 20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===30th Anniversary===\nIn celebration of the 30th anniversary of the film, Clive Barker has adapted his early \"Hell Priest\" concept designs for the Lead Cenobite into an officially licensed mask for Composite Effects.

In 2011 the duo discussed with Collider the reasons that ultimately led to their departure from the project. As Maury related: \"The problem was that we couldn't agree on the script with the studio. It's kind of obvious why. We are hardcore fans of the original and we wanted to be respectful to Clive Barker's universe. Without his greenlight, we never would have done it. We wouldn't have even considered it.

The film's story would differ from the original film, as Lussier and Farmer did not want to retell the original story out of respect for Clive Barker's work. The film was to instead focus on the world and function of the puzzle box. Lussier and Farmer dismissed the notion of a teen-oriented ''Hellraiser'' film, stating \"if we do ''Hellraiser'', it's rated R; if they want to do PG-13 then they have to get rid of us\". In 2011, Farmer confirmed that both he and Lussier were no longer attached to the project.<ref name=\"remakeconcepts\">{{cite news|url=http://movieweb.com/abandoned-hellraiser-remake-cenobite-concepts/|title=Abandoned Hellraiser Remake Cenobite Concepts|work=MovieWeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horror-movies.ca/2011/09/hellraiser-remake-halloween-3d|title=Exclusive: Hellraiser Remake & Halloween 3D Updates|publisher=Horror-Movies.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=20823|title='Hellraiser' Remake Is Stalling Again|publisher=ShockTillYouDrop}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2013, Clive Barker posted on his official Facebook page that he would be personally writing the remake of the original ''Hellraiser'' and that he had already completed a deal with Dimension Films' Bob Weinstein.
