The acts taking place became homosexual in nature, with Br\u00fcno inviting a man up to fight him, who turned out to be Lutz. [[Celine Dion]]'s \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\" started to play as both men began kissing and stripping. The audience reacted violently and threw chairs and beer at the performers.
