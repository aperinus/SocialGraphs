The characters Ace ([[Wood Harris]]), Mitch ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), and Rico ([[Cam'ron]]), are fictionally based on the 1980s [[Harlem]] [[drug dealers]] [[Azie Faison|Azie \"AZ\" Faison]], [[Rich Porter]], and [[Alpo Martinez]]. The title of the film is borrowed from the [[Paid in Full (album)|1987 album]] and [[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|song]] by [[Eric B. & Rakim]].\n\n==Plot==\nAce is a young man living with his mom and sister in the [[Harlem]] ghetto working a dead-end job at a dry cleaning shop. His sister's boyfriend, Calvin, is a successful cocaine dealer while Ace's close friend Mitch is a flashy, popular drug dealer. Despite both of them promising a life of easy money, expensive cars and women, Ace decides to live a law-abiding life. While at work, Ace finds some cocaine in one of his customers\u2019 pants. The customer, Lulu, is a cocaine supplier who lets Ace keep the drug. When Calvin gets arrested on drug charges, Ace runs into one of his customers and easily sells him the cocaine for $100. Impressed, Ace goes back to Lulu for more cocaine to sell.\n\nLulu has a top-quality supply of cocaine which Ace sells on the street at a cheap price, quickly luring away customers from other drug dealers. Ace starts wholesaling his product to other dealers in the neighborhood, believing everyone can make money and be happy. Meanwhile, Mitch is arrested for killing a stickup man who robbed one of his workers. When a fight breaks out between Mitch and another inmate, Mitch is aided by East Harlem inmate Rico who impresses Mitch by his ferocity and show of support. Mitch is able to beat his murder charge and both him and Rico join Ace's drug empire when released from prison. The trio become wealthy, buying foreign cars, jewelry and expensive champagne. Ace maintains a low profile, Mitch returns to his life as the popular hustler while Rico is a ruthless enforcer who worries Ace with his overzealous, high-profile behavior.\n\nWhen Calvin is released from prison, Ace agrees to give him product to sell in his old drug spot, but Calvin quickly becomes dissatisfied with what he feels is a marginal position. When Ace refuses to let Calvin run his old block, Calvin retaliates by attempting to rob Ace at his Aunt June's apartment, holding June and Dora hostage. When Ace is unable to open the safe, June and Dora are executed by Calvin as another associate shoots Ace in the head, leaving him for dead. Despite his wounds, Ace survives as baby is born the same night. Feeling the physical and psychological effects of the shooting, Ace decides to quit the drug trade.\n\nRico tries to assuage Ace's concerns by revealing that he killed Calvin to show potential enemies that the organization is strong. Ace strongly disagrees with Rico's initiative and remains steadfast in his position to retire. Mitch understands Ace's perspective that the drug game does not reciprocate any love or generosity. Mitch decides to stay in the drug game because he loves the hustle, comparing himself to professional basketball players that continue to chase glory despite having enough money to retire. Ace decides to let Mitch and Rico take over, vowing to introduce Mitch to his drug supplier.\n\nWhile Ace is recovering, Mitch's kid brother Sonny is kidnapped for ransom. Mitch reaches out to Ace who provides him with enough cocaine to pay Sonny's ransom and allow Mitch and Rico to resume business. Mitch enlists Rico to help sell the cocaine to pay the ransom, but Rico instead kills Mitch and steals the cocaine. Suspicious, Ace questions Rico who claims he had not seen Mitch the day he was killed. Ace knows he's lying and settles the issue by giving him the contact to a pair of undercover FBI agents he had spoken to and avoided previously. Rico is arrested and is last seen in custody giving up information on his drug connections in [[Washington D.C.]] in order to avoid a 25-to-life sentence. He refuses to inform on anyone in Harlem, intending on reclaiming his position when he is eventually released from prison. Sonny's kidnapping and subsequent murder were orchestrated by his own uncle who resented Mitch for not providing him with money and for kicking him out of his family's apartment. Ace retreats from the criminal underworld and makes a new life for himself and his family using diamonds that he previously found in Lulu's apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Wood Harris]] \u2013 [[Azie Faison|Ace]]\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] \u2013 [[Rich Porter|Mitch]]\n* [[Cam'ron]] \u2013 [[Alpo Martinez|Rico]]\n* [[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]] \u2013 Calvin\n* [[Esai Morales]] \u2013 Luis \"Lulu\" Lujano\n* [[Chi McBride]] \u2013 Pip\n* Remo Green \u2013 Sonny\n* Cynthia Martells \u2013 Dora\n* [[Elise Neal]] \u2013 June\n* [[Regina Hall]] \u2013 Keisha\n* [[Ron Cephas Jones]] \u2013 Ice (based on Rich's uncle Apple)\n* [[Karen Andrew]] \u2013 Cakes\n* [[Jonas Chernick]] \u2013 Detective / Surgeon\n* [[Wes Williams]] \u2013 Mitch's Friend\n* [[Rufus Crawford]] \u2013 Tommy\n* [[Jason Burke]] \u2013 Street Runner\n* [[K.
