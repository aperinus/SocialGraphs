At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves increasingly caught up in the chaotic and [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] violence, eventually becoming accomplices. The film received the [[Andr\u00e9 Cavens Award for Best Film]] by the [[Belgian Film Critics Association]] (UCC). Since its release, the picture has become a [[cult film]], and received a rare [[NC-17]] rating for its release in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/man-bites-dog,37588/|title=Man Bites Dog|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=28 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBen is a witty and charismatic but narcissistic and easily-enraged [[serial killer]] who holds forth at length about whatever comes to mind, be it the \"craft\" of murder, the failings of architecture, his own poetry, or classical music, which he plays with his girlfriend Valerie. A film crew joins him on his [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] adventures, recording them for a [[fly on the wall]] documentary. Ben takes them to meet his family and friends while boasting of murdering many people at random and dumping their bodies in canals and quarries. The viewer witnesses these grisly killings in graphic detail.\n\nBen ventures into apartment buildings, explaining how it is more cost-effective to attack old people than young couples because the elderly have more cash at home and are easier to kill. In a following scene, he screams wildly at an elderly lady, causing her to have a heart attack. As she lies dying, he casually remarks that this method saved him a bullet. Ben continues his candid explanations and rampage, shooting, strangling, and beating to death anyone who comes his way: women, illegal immigrants and postmen (his favorite targets). He enjoys killing a postman at the start of the month because they tend to have parcels with money and other goods he can steal; enjoys killing women because they don't fight back; and enjoys killing immigrants because he's a total racist (he jokes about having murdered two Muslims and making sure to entomb their bodies in a wall that faces [[Mecca]], and amuses himself by checking out the genitals of a black security guard after he's shot the man in the head).\n\nThe camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, starting out as silent accomplices but gradually assisting Ben in his killings. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him with a pillow, all the while keeping up a casual conversation. During filming, two of Ben's crew are killed; their deaths are later called \"occupational hazards\" by a crew member and off-handedly mourned. At the abandoned building that Ben uses for a hideout, the crew encounters two Italian criminals or gangsters also hiding out in the building. Ben kills the Italians before discovering that they were actually also being filmed by a competing documentary camera crew. Ben and his camera crew have fun taking turns as they shoot the rival crew members to death and record the whole thing.\n\nWhile fooling around with crew, when Ben takes a couple having sex hostage in their own home, he holds the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, while the husband had his throat cut. Later, Ben's girlfriend and family receive death threats from the brother of one of the Italian criminals who Ben had killed earlier. Ben's violence becomes more and more random until he kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben gifts. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.\n\nAfter a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point, someone, presumably the brother of the dead Italian along with other members of the two dead Italians' [[criminal organization]], starts taking revenge on Ben and his family. Ben discovers that his girlfriend Valerie has been killed: a flautist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. He later finds that his parents met the same fate, his mother, who owns a shop and is \"not a musician\", being sodomized with the end of a broomstick. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem, he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing [[sound recordist]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as Ben\n* Val\u00e9rie Parent as Valerie\n* R\u00e9my Belvaux as Remy (Reporter)\n* Andr\u00e9 Bonzel as Andre (Cameraman)\n* Jean-Marc Chenut as Patrick (Sound Man #1)\n* Alain Oppezzi as Franco (Sound Man #2)\n* Vincent Tavier as Vincent (Sound Man #3)\n\n==Production==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\n}}\n''Man Bites Dog'' is shot in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] on 16mm film and was produced on a shoe-string budget by four student filmmakers, led by director [[R\u00e9my Belvaux]].
