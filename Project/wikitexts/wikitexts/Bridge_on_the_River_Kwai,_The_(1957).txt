Colonel Nicholson. US Navy Commander Shears tells of the horrific conditions. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because they were ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.\n\nColonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the new prisoners they will all work, even officers, on the construction of a railway bridge over the [[Khwae Yai River|River Kwai]] that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson objects, informing Saito the [[Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War (1929)|Geneva Convention]] exempts officers from manual labour. After the enlisted men are marched to the bridge site, Saito threatens to have the officers shot, until Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder. Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.\n\nShears and two others escape. Only he survives, though he is wounded. He wanders into a Burmese village, is nursed back to health, and eventually reaches the British colony of [[Ceylon]].\n\nWork on the bridge proceeds badly, due to both the faulty Japanese engineering plans and the prisoners' slow pace and deliberate sabotage. Saito is expected to commit [[seppuku|ritual suicide]] if he fails to meet the rapidly approaching deadline. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's 1905 victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] as an excuse to save face; he announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men and orders the building of a proper bridge, intending it to stand as a tribute to the [[British Army]]'s ingenuity for centuries to come. Clipton objects, believing this to be collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson's obsession with the bridge eventually drives him to order his officers to engage in manual labor.\n\nShears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon unknowingly within a commando school referred to as \"Force 316\" (likely based on the real world [[Force 136]] of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE)). Major Warden of SOE invites Shears to join a commando mission to destroy the bridge just as it is completed. Shears tries to get out of the mission by confessing that he impersonated an officer, hoping for better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the US Navy had agreed to transfer him to the British SOE with the simulated rank of Major to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.\n\nWarden, Shears, and two other commandos parachute into Thailand; one, Chapman, dies after falling into a tree, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and must be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers. A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate. Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across, but is himself shot. Recognising Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \"What have I done?\"\n\nWarden fires a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], killing Shears and Joyce and fatally wounding Nicholson. Dying, Nicholson stumbles toward the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge and sending the train hurtling into the river. Warden tells the Siamese women that he had to prevent anyone from falling into enemy hands, and leaves with them. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head and mutters, \"Madness!&nbsp;... Madness!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:William Holden and Chandran Rutnam while shooting The Bridge on the River Kwai.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Chandran Rutnam]] and [[William Holden]] while shooting'' The Bridge on the River Kwai.'']]\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Holden]] as \"Commander\" Shears, U.S. Navy (later [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Major]], [[Force 136|Force 316]])\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as Major Warden, [[Force 136|Force 316]]\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as Lt.

The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman's work. The official [[credit (creative arts)|credit]] was given to [[Pierre Boulle]] (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script.<ref>''The Guardian'', 17 April 1991</ref>\n\nThe film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising \"what have I done?\") does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax.<ref name=1974ref>Joyaux, Georges.

Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and exploded in anger when Guinness asked him why he was doing this.

Bandaranaike]], then [[Prime Minister of Ceylon]], and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming.

Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends.\n\nSome Japanese viewers resented the movie's depiction of their engineers' capabilities as inferior and less advanced than they were in reality. Japanese engineers had been surveying and planning the route of the railway since 1937, and they had demonstrated considerable skill during their construction efforts across [[South-East Asia]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Summers| first=Julie| date=2012| title=The Colonel of Tamarkan: Philip Toosey and the Bridge on the River Kwai| page=6| url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/colonel-tamarkan-philip-toosey-bridge-on-river-kwai| access-date=6 January 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108185205/http://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/lunchtime-lectures/video-archive/colonel-tamarkan-philip-toosey-bridge-on-river-kwai| archive-date=8 January 2015| website=National Army Museum}}</ref> Some Japanese viewers also disliked the film for portraying the Allied prisoners of war as more capable of constructing the bridge than the Japanese engineers themselves were, accusing the filmmakers of being unfairly biased and unfamiliar of realities of the bridge construction, a sentiment echoed by surviving prisoners of war who saw the film in cinemas.<ref>{{cite web| first=Hirakawa| last=Sukehiro| title=Bridge on the River Kwai| url=http://www.fepow-community.org.uk/monthly_Revue/html/bridge_on_the_river_kwai.htm| access-date=6 January 2015| website=FEPOW community}}</ref>\n\nThe major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai.

He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later.

Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition.<ref>[http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/columbiaclassics/in-production/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828092559/http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/columbiaclassics/in-production/|date=28 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In 1962, [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Peter Sellers]], with [[Peter Cook]] and [[Jonathan Miller]], released the [[LP album|LP record]] ''[[Bridge on the River Wye]]'' (Parlophone LP PMC<!-- not a PMCID--> 1190, PCS 3036 (November 1962)).  This spoof of the film was based on the script for the 1957 ''[[Goon Show]]'' episode \"An African Incident\". Shortly before its release, for legal reasons, producer [[George Martin]] edited out the 'K' every time the word 'Kwai' was spoken.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thegoonshow.net/facts.asp |title= Facts and Trivia | work = The Goon Show Site | access-date= 2014-05-16}}</ref>\n* The comedy team of [[Wayne and Shuster]] performed a sketch titled \"Kwai Me a River\" on their 27 March 1967 TV show, in which an officer in the British Dental Corps (Wayne) is captured by the Japanese and, despite being comically unintimidated by any abuse the commander of the POW camp (Shuster) inflicts on him, is forced to build a (dental) \"bridge on the river Kwai\" for the commander and plans to include an explosive in the appliance to detonate in his mouth. The commander survives the explosion, attributed to a toothpaste commercial punchline in 1960s commercials.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18984/wayne_and_shuster_show,_the/episode_guide/ |title= Wayne and Shuster Show, The Episode Guide (1954\u20131990) (series) |publisher= TV archive CA |access-date= 2007-11-03 |archive-date= 27 June 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190627192426/http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18984/wayne_and_shuster_show,_the/episode_guide/ |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n*[[Billy Joel]] mentions it in his 1989 song \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Billy Joel \u2013 We Didn't Start the Fire|url=https://genius.com/Billy-joel-we-didnt-start-the-fire-lyrics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n* [[Ron Swanson]], a character in the television series ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', mentions ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' as one of the few movies he has seen and a viewing of it is given to him as a birthday present.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Velez|first=Ali|title=How Well Do You Remember Ron Swanson's Funniest Lines From \"Parks And Rec\"?|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/can-you-finish-these-classic-ron-swanson-quotes|access-date=2021-01-25|website=BuzzFeed|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kandell|first=Steve|title=Parks and Recreation Recap: Death to Crepe-town - TV|url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/05/parks_and_recreation_eagleton.html|access-date=2021-01-25|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[BFI Top 100 British films]]\n* [[List of American films of 1957]]\n* [[List of historical drama films]]\n* [[List of historical drama films of Asia]]\n* ''[[To End All Wars]]'' (film)\n* ''[[Return from the River Kwai]]'' (1989 film)\n* ''[[Siam-Burma Death Railway (film)|Siam-Burma Death Railway]]'' (film)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Santas|first=Constantine|title=The Epic Films of David Lean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6H_hej3agQC&pg=PA1|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8210-2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=33 Movies to Restore Your Faith in Humanity: Ebert's Essentials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WpkLM-6Sk7gC|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-1-4494-2225-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|author-link=Gene D.
