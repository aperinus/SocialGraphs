The film stars [[Shirley Temple]] as the titular orphan, who is taken from her grandfather to live as a companion to Klara, a spoiled, disabled girl. It was a success and Temple enjoyed her third consecutive year as number one box office draw.\n\n==Plot==\nAdelheid, called Heidi ([[Shirley Temple]]), is an eight-year-old Swiss orphan who is given by her aunt Dete ([[Mady Christians]]) to her mountain-dwelling hermit grandfather, Adolph ([[Jean Hersholt]]). While Adolph behaves coolly toward her at first, her cheery nature turns him warm, and sees him open up to the nearby town.\n\nHeidi is then stolen back by her aunt, to live in the wealthy Sesemann household in [[Frankfurt am Main]] as a companion to Klara ([[Marcia Mae Jones]]), a sheltered, disabled girl in a wheelchair who is constantly watched by the strict Fr\u00e4ulein Rottenmeier ([[Mary Nash (actress)|Mary Nash]]). Heidi is unhappy but makes the best of the situation, always longing for her grandfather.\n\nWhen Klara's body and spirits mend under Heidi's cheerful companionship, Rottenmeier (who has tried to keep Klara dependent upon her) tries to get rid of Heidi by selling her to the gypsies, but she is stopped by the police. Heidi is rescued and reunited with her grandfather.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shirley Temple]] as '''Heidi''', an 8-year-old orphan living with her hermitted grandfather in an Alpine hut. She is very happy, optimistic and adventurous.\n* [[Jean Hersholt]] as '''Adolph Kramer''', Heidi's grandfather who is grumpy at first but grows to care deeply for Heidi.\n* [[Marcia Mae Jones]] as '''Klara Sesemann''', a wealthy, disabled girl prone to tantrums. However, she shows kindness towards Heidi.\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as '''Herr Sesemann''', Klara's busy father who dotes on his daughter, wanting nothing but happiness for her.\n* [[Thomas Beck (actor)|Thomas Beck]] as '''Schultz''', the village pastor who tries to appeal to Adolph about Heidi's future.\n* [[Arthur Treacher]] as '''Andrews''', the butler of the Sesemann household who is always kind to Heidi.\n* [[Mary Nash (actress)|Mary Nash]] as '''Fr\u00e4ulein Rottenmeier''', the no-nonsense ch\u00e2telaine of the Sesemann household, who claims that her strictness is for Klara's well-being.\n* [[Delmar Watson]] as '''Peter''', Adolph's goatherd and a good friend of Heidi's.\n* [[Mady Christians]] as '''Dete''', Heidi's self-interested aunt who has taken care of her for six years prior to pushing her off on her grandfather.\n* [[Helen Westley]] as '''Blind Anna''', Peter's grandmother.\n* [[Christian Rub]] as '''Baker'''\n* [[Frank Reicher]] (''uncredited'') as '''Police lieutenant'''\n\n==Production==\nThe Alpine scenes were filmed at [[Lake Arrowhead, California]] with cast and crew staying in the Lake Arrowhead Hotel or in private chalets. Temple lived in a trailer parked on a hillside and only left it at the last moment to do her scenes \u2013 after her stand-in had finished with lights and sound. Temple had at least eight bodyguards who escorted her to and from the trailer and about the area when necessary.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}\n\nMidway through the shooting of the film, the dream sequence was added into the script. There were reports that Temple was behind the dream sequence and that she was enthusiastically pushing for it but in her autobiography she vehemently denied this. Her contract gave neither her nor her parents any creative control over the films she was in. While she enjoyed the opportunity to wear braids and to be lifted on high wire, she saw this as the collapse of any serious attempt by the studio to build upon the dramatic role from the previous film ''[[Wee Willie Winkie (film)|Wee Willie Winkie]]''.<ref>Shirley Temple Black, \"Child Star: An Autobiography\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 192-193.</ref>\n\nDuring the scene where Temple's character gets butted by the goat, she initially did the scene herself while completely padded up. After a few takes, however, her mother stepped in and insisted that a double be used. One of the extras, a boy, was dressed up to look like her. The boy's father was so upset over him doubling for a girl that he prohibited him from ever acting again. The double, who was not named, would later share diplomatic duties with Temple in Africa. Temple also had trouble milking the goat. To remedy this, Dwan had a flexible piece of tubing installed in such a way as to make it look as if the goat was being milked.<ref>Shirley Temple Black, \"Child Star: An Autobiography\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 190-192.</ref>\n\nDuring the making of the film, director Dwan had new badges made for the Shirley Temple Police Force. This was an informal group thought up by Temple in 1935, which was, as she described \"an organized system of obligations from whomever I was able to shanghai into membership.\"<ref>Shirley Temple Black, \"Child Star: An Autobiography\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 89.</ref> Every child wore one after swearing allegiance and obedience to 'Chief' Temple.  Everyone on the set was soon wearing badges with Temple strutting about giving orders to the crew such as \"Take that set down and build me a castle.\" They went along with the game.{{r|edwards1988|page1=111}}\n\nTemple made one other film in 1937, ''Wee Willie Winkie''. The child actress was growing older and the studio was questioning how much longer she could keep playing \"cute\" roles when ''Heidi'' was filmed, but she retained her position as number one at the box office for the third year in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/314029%7C0/Heidi.html |title=Heidi (1937) |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |website=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc. |access-date=August 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews were generally positive.
