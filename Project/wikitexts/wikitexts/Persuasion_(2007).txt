It was directed by [[Adrian Shergold]], and the screenplay was written by Simon Burke. [[Sally Hawkins]] stars as the protagonist [[Anne Elliot]], while [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] plays Captain [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]]. Eight years prior to the film's beginning, Anne was persuaded to reject Wentworth's proposal of marriage. Now 27 and unmarried, Anne re-encounters Wentworth, who has made his fortune in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and is looking for a wife\u2014anyone but Anne, whom he has not forgiven for rejecting him all those years ago.\n\n''Persuasion'' was one of three novels adapted in 2007 for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[The Jane Austen Season|Jane Austen season]]. It was the first of the three adaptations to begin development. The drama was co-produced by [[Clerkenwell Films]] and American studio [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]]. ''Persuasion'' premiered on 1 April 2007 in the United Kingdom and was watched by 5.4 million viewers. ''Persuasion'' received positive reviews from television critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Elliot family faces financial difficulties from the imprudent spending of Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth. An advisor proposes the family estate of Kellynch Hall be leased to Admiral Croft, home from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], but [[Anne Elliot]] is distraught at the prospect.\n\nThe admiral is married to the sister of Captain [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]], a [[Captain (naval)|naval captain]] to whom Anne was engaged eight years earlier. At that time, then-[[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] Wentworth was penniless and without a ship at the outset of a very dangerous career, and the union was discouraged by Anne's father and Lady Russell, a family friend who persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Years later, Anne is seemingly past the age of desirability, while Wentworth has risen in the [[Royal Navy]] and is rich in [[prize money]].\n\nSir Walter and Elizabeth depart for [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and send Anne to stay with her younger sister Mary, who is married to Charles Musgrove and lives at the Musgrove family's estate, Uppercross. Wentworth comes to visit his sister at Kellynch Hall and then makes friends with the Musgroves. Anne and Wentworth meet again, but he appears cold and distant. She is convinced that he will never forgive her, nor love her again. Her disappointment is heightened by the attention Wentworth is given by young Louisa and Henrietta Musgrove.\n\nWentworth declares his intention to travel to [[Lyme Regis|Lyme]] to visit some friends, Captains Harry Harville and James Benwick, and they all decide to go. In Lyme, Benwick has been inconsolable since the death of his fianc\u00e9e (Harville's sister) while he was away at the [[Naval Base Simon's Town|Cape]], and spends his days reading dark poetry and lamenting his loss. A match for him in reading and familiar with loss and disappointment, Anne is able to encourage Benwick. Although he warms in his outlook toward life and to Anne, her heart remains with Wentworth.\n\nIn a dangerous demonstration of steadfastness, Louisa jumps from the Cobb and strikes her head against the stones. Unconscious and bleeding, she is taken to Harville's home to recover. Wentworth escorts Anne and Henrietta back to Uppercross in order to inform Louisa's parents of her injury, then Anne and Wentworth bid each other a seemingly final farewell.\n\nAnne joins her father and sister in Bath, where they have been receiving the attentions of William Elliot, a distant cousin who is the [[heir presumptive]] to Sir Walter's estate and [[baronet]]cy. He is apparently wealthy and very gracious to the Elliots, and Anne finds herself the subject of his interest, but detects a false note in his manner.\n\nWhile Louisa recovers, Wentworth realises his feelings towards Anne are unchanged, but Harville informs him that an attachment is assumed between Wentworth and Louisa. Dismayed, Wentworth takes Harville's advice to leave, and visits his brother. Returning a few weeks later, he learns that Louisa and Benwick are engaged. Delighted at this turn of events, Wentworth goes to Bath under the pretext of visiting his sister.\n\nThere, Wentworth learns that William has been courting Anne. Having heard rumours of William's proposal, Admiral Croft sends Wentworth to notify Anne that if she and William wish to reside at Kellynch Hall after their wedding, he would be willing to cancel his lease. To Wentworth's surprise, Anne tells him the admiral is mistaken, as she has not consented to marry William. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lady Russell and, in the commotion of additional visitors, are unable to speak privately. Wentworth slips away and subsequently writes a note for Anne, confessing his long-held love and his desire to marry her.\n\nAnne excuses herself from the visitors and runs after Wentworth, but cannot find him. She encounters her good friend Mrs. Smith, who informs her that William has been deceitful. He covets the baronetcy and, once married to Anne, planned to establish Mrs. Clay as his mistress. This would avert Mrs. Clay's potential marriage to Sir Walter and the possible birth of a male heir, which could have prevented William from inheriting the title. Anne then continues her search for Wentworth and comes across Harville, who gives her Wentworth's note to read.\n\nRunning along the [[Royal Crescent]], Anne finally finds Wentworth, and accepts his proposal. Wentworth asks if she is sure. Anne replies that she has never been more determined in her life, and kisses him.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins making the 2007 movie Persuasion.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Rupert Penry-Jones]] and [[Sally Hawkins]] during filming]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as [[Anne Elliot]]\n* [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as Captain [[Frederick Wentworth (Persuasion)|Frederick Wentworth]]\n* [[Anthony Head]] as Sir Walter Elliot\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Elizabeth Elliot\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Lady Russell\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as William Elliot, Anne's distant cousin\n* [[Michael Fenton Stevens]] as Mr. Shepherd\n* [[Mary Stockley]] as Mrs. Clay\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as Captain Harry Harville\n* [[Finlay Robertson]] as Captain James Benwick\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as Mr. Musgrove\n* [[Amanda Hale]] as Mary Musgrove, Anne's sister\n* [[Sam Hazeldine]] as Charles Musgrove\n* [[Jennifer Higham]] as Louisa Musgrove\n* Rosamund Stephen as Henrietta Musgrove\n* [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as Admiral Croft\n* [[Marion Bailey]] as Mrs. Croft, Frederick's sister\n* Maisie Dimbleby as Mrs. Smith\n* Sarah Buckland as Nurse Rooke\n* Tilly Tremayne as Vicountess Dalrymple\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\nOn 10 November 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Julia Day reported ITV controller of drama, Nick Elliott, had ordered three new adaptations of ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]''.<ref name=\"Day\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV?INTCMP=SRCH|title=ITV falls in love with Jane Austen|last=Day|first=Julia|date=10 November 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=18 July 2012|archive-date=11 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411140339/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV?INTCMP=SRCH|url-status=live}}</ref> Elliot commented that the adaptations would be \"important remakes for the new generation\".<ref name=\"Glendinning\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-generation-of-teenagers-prepare-to-be-seduced-with-rebirth-of-austen-436556.html|title=New generation of teenagers prepare to be seduced with rebirth of Austen|last=Glendinning|first=Lee|date=16 February 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=7 July 2012|archive-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219155425/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-generation-of-teenagers-prepare-to-be-seduced-with-rebirth-of-austen-436556.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He explained \"About every 10 years, all the great stories need retelling.

Using small parts of Austen's narration, he placed it in the hand of Anne. After much reading and research, Hawkins came to view the character of Anne Elliot as a view of Jane Austen herself.<ref name=\"Idato\" /> With Hawkins over-voicing the diary entries the person of Jane Austen is brought to life.
