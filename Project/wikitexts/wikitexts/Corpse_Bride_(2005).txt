The plot is set in a fictional [[Victorian era]] village in [[England]]. [[Johnny Depp]] leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while [[Helena Bonham Carter]] voices Emily, the titular bride. An [[international co-production]] between the United States and United Kingdom, ''Corpse Bride'' is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', were directed by [[Henry Selick]]). This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It was dedicated to executive producer [[Joe Ranft]], who died in a car crash during production.\n\n''Corpse Bride'' premiered at the [[Venice International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2005, and was released on September 23, 2005, in the United States and on October 13, 2005, in the United Kingdom. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $118.1 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received praise for its animation, characters, songs, and humor. The film won the [[National Board of Review]] for Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature#List of winners and nominees|78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', which also starred Bonham Carter. The film won the [[Annie Awards]] Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement in 2006, where it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Character Design, and Best Direction. It was shot with [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]] [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLRs]], rather than the [[135 film|35&nbsp;mm film]] cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993).\n\n==Plot==\nIn an unnamed [[Victorian era]] town, Victor Van Dort, the son of [[nouveau riche]] fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected daughter of [[impoverished]] [[aristocrat]]s, prepare for their [[arranged marriage]], which will simultaneously raise the [[social class]] of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's family (\"According to Plan\"). Although they fall in love instantly, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and accidentally setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he successfully rehearses his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on an upturned root. However, the root is revealed to be the finger of a dead girl named Emily, who rises from the grave, proclaims herself as Victor's new wife, and spirits him away to the [[Underworld|Land of the Dead]].\n\nDuring his time with Emily, Victor learns that she was murdered years ago on the night of her elopement by her fianc\u00e9, who stole the family jewels and gold she had brought (\"[[Remains of the Day (song)|Remains of the Day]]\"). Emily reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps, and they bond. Desperate to return to Victoria, however, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and, feeling betrayed and hurt, drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead (\"Tears to Shed\"). Victoria tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but nobody believes her and they assume he has left her and she is going mad. Against her will, Victoria's parents decide to marry her to Lord Barkis Bittern, a presumed-wealthy visitor who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.\n\nAfter reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily properly, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows with her in the Land of the Living and drink poison in order to join Emily in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head \"upstairs\" (\"The Wedding Song\"), where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until the living recognize their departed loved ones and joyously reunite with them. The chaos causes a panicked Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him.\n\nVictoria witnesses Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria; Emily recognizes Barkis as both her previous fianc\u00e9 and murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Accepting defeat, Barkis mockingly [[Toast (honor)|toasts]] Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison, causing him to die and allowing the dead \u2013 who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living \u2013 to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, releases Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria. As she steps into the moonlight, she transforms into a swarm of butterflies that fly into the sky as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Helena Bonham Carter (Berlin Film Festival 2011) 3 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena Bonham Carter]] voices the title character.]]\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Emily the Corpse Bride, a beautiful and na\u00efve young [[revenant]] woman with a passion for music and dance.\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Victor Van Dort, a timid but good natured young man who is engaged to Victoria Everglot for social and financial reasons.\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Victoria Everglot, Victor's pretty, sweet-natured, yet abused fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as two characters:\n** Nell Van Dort, Victor's socially ambitious mother who loves but holds too much [[contempt]] for him.\n** Hildegarde, the elderly [[maid]] of the Everglot household.\n* [[Paul Whitehouse]] as three characters:\n** William Van Dort, Victor's absent-minded and tactless fish merchant father.\n** Mayhew, the Van Dorts' coachman.\n** Paul the Head Waiter, literally a severed head.\n* [[Joanna Lumley]] as Maudeline Everglot, Victoria's [[abuse|abusive]], ugly-chinned, unloving mother.\n* [[Albert Finney]] as two characters:\n** Finis Everglot, Victoria's [[abuse|abusive]] [[toad]]-like, unloving father.\n** Grandfather Everglot, Finis' deceased grandfather.\n* [[Richard E.

Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to hit. My job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage as close as possible to how I thought he wanted it.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Tim Burton by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tim Burton]] co-directed the film.]]\nThe film was originally supposed to have been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> In 1997, during pre-production on [[Henry Selick]]'s feature, ''[[Monkeybone]]'', the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> After finishing ''Monkeybone'', Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]], an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm).<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: \"One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect\u2014the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\nAnimation took place at [[3 Mills Studios]] in [[East London]].<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when production began, but that number had tripled by the end of production.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The three primary characters\u2014Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride\u2014were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> A total of 32 cameras were used on the film.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Each camera was outfitted with a \"grabber\" system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short \"reel\" of the shot being produced to check their work.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\nThe film's images were stored on a 1GB image card that was capable of holding approximately 100 frames of animation.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Eight roving camera teams\u2014each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues\u2014worked with the animators to set up shots.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Each camera team had a \"lighting station\" workstation\u2014comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing\u2014to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and \"grabber\" computer/camera system to check their work.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: \"We shot as close to a 1:1 film ratio [one take per shot] as we could because there was no time for reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process\u2014as many ways as needed\u2014to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\nCo-director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators, sometimes acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a \"dope sheet\"\u2014in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame\u2014to account for key \"hits\". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on \"2s\" or \"4s\" (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation).<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Johnson explained: \"The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of \"data wranglers.\" Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a \"color cube.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: \"The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock\u2014in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\n[[File:Johnny Depp 2, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johnny Depp]] filmed ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and recorded dialogue for ''Corpse Bride'' simultaneously.]]\nVisual effects were delivered by London's [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), and were applied to the 1,000 or so shots in the film, though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements\u2014groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements.<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" /> Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: \"The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at.\"<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork1\" />\n\nIn a 2005, interview with [[About.com]], Burton spoke about the differences between directing  ''Corpse Bride'' and ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', saying: \"The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process.\"<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/thecorpsebride/a/corpsetb092005.htm |title=Tim Burton Interview on Corpse Bride, Johnny Depp |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=March 4, 2014 |access-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref> He also spoke about casting [[Johnny Depp]] as Victor, saying: \"It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he\u2019s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that\u2019s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [together]. They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [Finney] and Joanna [Lumley] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That\u2019s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together.
