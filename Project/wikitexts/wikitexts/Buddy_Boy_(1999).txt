The film premiered at the [[56th Venice International Film Festival]].\n\n[[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' called it \"a curious, unsettling, darkly conceived and absolutely fascinating little film. Not since [[Roman Polanski]] at the pinnacle of his European weirdness have I seen a film this strange and riveting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://observer.com/2000/03/you-may-never-take-another-bath-after-the-life-the-concert/|last=Reed|first=Rex|date=March 26, 2000|title=You May Never Take Another Bath|website=The New York Observer|access-date=December 12, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's title character, Francis, lives with his invalid, [[child abuse|abusive]] mother Sal in a dingy tenement apartment, and has suffered a life of unrelenting misfortune and brutality, further impacted by a [[stutter]]. Over time, he has withdrawn from the world and into himself, silently observing others rather than interacting with them. His only solace has been his [[Catholic]] faith, but he has begun to question his belief in a loving God who could countenance so much evil and pain.\n\nWhen he discovers he can see into the apartment of Gloria from his own back stairs, Francis cannot stop watching her, even after he meets her and they become romantically involved. Unable or unwilling to believe that she could actually love him, he becomes ever more obsessive in his [[voyeurism]]. And it is what Francis sees \u2013 or thinks he sees \u2013 that leads ultimately to his undoing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Francis\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Gloria\n* [[Susan Tyrrell]] as Sal\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Vic\n* [[Harry Groener]] as Father Gillespie\n\n==Release==\n''Buddy Boy'' premiered to a [[standing ovation]] at the Venice International Film Festival on September 5, 1999 in the Cinema del Presente section. It subsequently bowed at the [[1999 Toronto International Film Festival]] (World Cinema section) and [[South by Southwest Film Festival]], before being released theatrically by Fine Line Features in [[North America]] on March 24, 2000.\n\nFollowing its North American premiere, the film was released theatrically worldwide. International DVD releases have been made in [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The special edition DVD was released in North America by Image Entertainment on September 25, 2005.\n\nOn September 11, 2007, ''Buddy Boy'' was released as part of a three-film DVD triptych along with [[Antonia Bird]]'s ''[[Face (1997 film)|Face]]'' and [[Peter Medak]]'s ''[[Let Him Have It]]''.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.preview-online.com/sept_oct/feature_articles/buddyboy/|title=Repulsion Meets Rear Window|website=Preview Magazine|date=September 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630021711/http://www.preview-online.com/sept_oct/feature_articles/buddyboy/|archive-date=June 30, 2008|url-status=dead}}\n* {{IMDb title|0146516|Buddy Boy}}\n* {{Amg movie|181399|Buddy Boy}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Brook]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{psychological-thriller-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
