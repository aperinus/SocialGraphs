Like its source material, the film focuses on a half-human, half-vampire girl named Saya (Ji-hyun) who hunts full-blooded vampires in partnership with humans and seeks to destroy Onigen, the most powerful of vampires.\n\nThe film was released in Japan and other Asian markets on 29 May 2009. It was released in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2009 and saw a limited release to theatres in the United States starting on 10 July 2009. It received unfavorable reviews, being negatively compared to its source material.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970s [[Tokyo]], Saya is a 400-year-old [[Dhampir|half human-half vampire]] who hunts vampires. Raised by a man named Kato, she works loosely with an organisation known as \"The Council\", a secret society that has been hunting vampires for centuries. Saya's motivation goes beyond duty; she wants revenge: Onigen, the oldest of the vampires, murdered her father. For her next mission, she goes undercover as a student at Kanto High School on [[Yokota Air Base|an American air base]] near [[Fussa]].\n\nWhen she is introduced in her class, Saya's appearance quickly attracts the negative attention of a female classmate, Sharon. The daughter of the base's general, Alice McKee, is also bothered with the attention. At her school, she finds herself being mocked. Alice is asked by her [[Kendo]] instructor Powell to stay for the Kendo practice due to her poor performance. As soon as the teacher leaves, she finds herself at the mercy of Sharon and her sidekick friend who wield sharp bladed [[katana]]s to [[taunt]] and [[wikt:torment|torment]] her. Saya shows up just in time to stop Sharon from slashing Alice's throat. Despite Saya's effort to disguise her activity, Alice sees Sharon and her friend being butchered. However it is soon revealed that Sharon and her friend are vampires in disguise.\n\nBecause \"The Council\" cleans up the bodies of the [[demons]], Alice's father does not believe her story. Determined to make her own investigation, Alice goes to the bar where her Kendo instructor usually hangs out. To her horror her instructor, as well as the rest of the people in the bar, turn out to be vampires. Once again Saya comes to her rescue and has to fight off hordes of vampires surrounding them.\n\nGeneral McKee investigates \"The Council\", who disguise themselves as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Alice arrives just in time to witness her father's death. Her dying father gives her Saya's address. With nowhere else to go, Alice decides to seek Saya's help. Fortunately Saya has never sworn loyalty to \"The Council\" and protects Alice instead. The two of them flee the area and go off to the mountains to find and slay Onigen.\n\nIn their pursuit, Alice and Saya are run off the side of the road by an attacking demon and they fall into a [[ravine]]. When Alice and Saya awaken they are in [[Ancient Japan]] where Saya was raised. Onigen appears, reveals her true identity as Saya's mother, and fights Saya. Saya slays Onigen. Alice, who is injured during the fighting, wakes up to find herself at the wreckage of the truck and being carried into an [[ambulance]]. Later she is interviewed about the events surrounding her father's death, but her interviewer does not believe her story about the vampires or the Council. When asked about where Saya is, Alice answers that she is \"searching for a way back from the other side of the [[looking glass]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jun Ji-hyun]] as Saya Otonashi (credited as Gianna Jun)\n* [[Allison Miller]] as Alice McKee\n* [[Masiela Lusha]] as Sharon\n* [[JJ Feild]] as Luke\n* [[Koyuki]] as Onigen\n* [[Yasuaki Kurata]] as Kato Takatora\n* [[Larry Lamb]] as General McKee\n* [[Andrew Pleavin]] as Frank Nielsen\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Elder\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as Powell\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Michael Harrison\n* Ailish OConnor as Linda\n* [[Constantine Gregory]] as Mr. Henry\n* Joey Anaya as Creature\n* [[Khary Payton]] as Creature\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2006, [[Bill Kong]] announced that he was producing a live-action film adaptation of ''Blood: The Last Vampire,'' directed by [[Ronny Yu]].

However, she felt the direction and screenplay lacked \"freshness\" and \"nuance\", the special effects and choreography \"cool\" but unimpressive, and the ending predictable.<ref name=\"THR\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] rated the film three out of four stars, stating that it was \"surprisingly entertaining\" and a \"CGI fantasy\". He found the plot to be \"inconsequential\" to the action sequences. While he felt that Gianna was \"never really convincing as a martial artist\", he praised her for her \"sympathetic performance\" which he felt held the film together. As a whole, he found the movie to be \"sincere as an entertainment\" that \"looks good\" and is \"atmospheric\", and notes that he will be watching for Gianna in future films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090708/REVIEWS/907089989/1023 |title=Blood: the Last Vampire |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vampire film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://lastblood.asmik-ace.co.jp/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* [http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/bloodthelastvampire/ Official website] at [[Sony Pictures]]\n* {{IMDb title|806027}}\n* {{tcmdb title|662853}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|487957}}\n* {{hancinema film|Blood_2p__The_Last_Vampire}}\n\n{{Blood: The Last Vampire}}\n{{Clint Mansell}}\n{{Portal bar|France|Film|Martial arts|Speculative fiction/Horror}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood: The Last Vampire}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Anime film remakes]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:French vampire films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Martial arts horror films]]\n[[Category:Blood: The Last Vampire]]\n[[Category:Ninja films]]\n[[Category:Path\u00e9 films]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Clint Mansell]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:English-language Japanese films]]\n[[Category:English-language Chinese films]]\n[[Category:2000s action horror films]]\n[[Category:French action horror films]]\n[[Category:Japanese action horror films]]\n[[Category:French films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American action horror films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on animated series]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on manga]]\n[[Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture]]\n[[Category:Vampires in film]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Nahon]]\n[[Category:Destination Films films]]\n[[Category:Samuel Goldwyn Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n\n[[ja:BLOOD THE LAST VAMPIRE#\u5b9f\u5199\u6620\u753b\u7248]]"}]}}}}
