Lending the young women moral support is Nina's flamboyant gay friend Bobbi ([[Ronny Jhutti]]), and Nina's younger sister Priya (Zoe Henretty).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Shelley Conn]] as Nina Shah\n*[[Laura Fraser]] as Lisa\n*[[Art Malik]] as Raj\n*[[Ronny Jhutti]] as Bobbi\n*[[Veena Sood]] as Suman Shah\n*[[Atta Yaqub]] as Kary Shah\n*[[Zoe Henretty]] as Priya Shah\n*[[Raji James]] as Sanjay\n*[[Elaine C.
