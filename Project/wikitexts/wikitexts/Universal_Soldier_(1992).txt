Michaels]], and written by [[Richard Rothstein (screenwriter)|Richard Rothstein]], Christopher Leitch, and [[Dean Devlin]]. The film tells the story of [[Luc Deveraux]] ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]), a former U.S. Army soldier who was killed in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1969, and returned to life following a secret military project called the \"Universal Soldier\" program. However, he finds out about his past, though his memory was erased, and escapes alongside a young TV journalist ([[Ally Walker]]). Along the way, they have to deal with the return of his archenemy, Sgt. Andrew Scott ([[Dolph Lundgren]]), who had lost his sanity in the Vietnam War, and became a psychotic megalomaniac, intent on killing him and leading the Universal Soldiers.\n\n''Universal Soldier'' was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on July 10, 1992. The film has a 35% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and grossed $95 million worldwide against its budget of $23 million and spawned a [[Universal Soldier (film series)|series of films]]: theatrical sequel ''[[Universal Soldier: The Return]]'', alternative [[direct-to-video]] sequel ''[[Universal Soldier: Regeneration]]'', standalone direct-to-video film ''[[Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning]]'', and two direct-to-TV films, ''[[Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms]]'' and ''[[Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business]]''.\n\nIt was the first film on-screen collaboration between Van Damme and Lundgren in the film series, who both later worked together in ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' and ''[[Black Water (2018 film)|Black Water]]'', and their [[Voice acting|voice-roles]] in ''[[Minions: The Rise of Gru]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969, a U.S. Army team secures a village against North Vietnamese forces. Luc Deveraux discovers members of his squad and villagers murdered. Deveraux's sergeant, Andrew Scott, has gone insane, made a necklace of severed ears, and is holding a young couple hostage. Deveraux tries to reason with Scott, who executes the man and orders Deveraux to shoot the girl to prove his loyalty. Deveraux refuses, and Scott kills the girl with a grenade. After shooting each other to death, Deveraux and Scott's corpses are recovered by a second squad and [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen, their disappearance classified as \"missing in action\".\n\nDeveraux and Scott's corpses, with others, are reanimated decades later and selected for the \"Universal Soldier\" (UniSol) program, an elite counter-terrorism unit. They are given a neural serum to keep their minds susceptible and their [[Memory inhibition|past memories suppressed]]. Their group is deployed to the [[Hoover Dam]] to resolve a hostage situation. The team demonstrates its superior training and physical abilities against the terrorists, such as when UniSol GR76 withstands close-range rifle fire. Deveraux regains memories from his former life upon seeing two hostages that resemble the Vietnamese villagers. Deveraux disobeys commands from the control team and become unresponsive.\n\nIn the mobile command center, the UniSols are revealed to be [[genetically augmented]] soldiers with enhanced self-healing abilities and superior strength, but they overheat and shut down. Because of the glitch, Woodward, one of the technicians on the project, suggests removing Deveraux from the team, but UniSol commander Colonel Perry refuses. TV journalist Veronica Roberts, who was fired while covering the Hoover Dam incident, tries to get a story on the UniSol project to regain her job. Roberts sneaks onto the base with a cameraman, discovering GR76 immersed in ice, still alive despite normally fatal injuries.\n\nWhen Roberts is discovered, Deveraux and Scott are ordered to capture her dead or alive. She flees to her cameraman's car, but they crash. Scott coldly murders the cameraman against orders. Deveraux rescues Roberts, and they escape in a UniSol vehicle. To protect the program, Colonel Perry sends the remaining UniSols to find Deveraux and Roberts.\n\nDeveraux and Roberts flee to a motel, where Roberts discovers she has been framed for the murder of her cameraman. Deveraux collapses from overheating and has to take an ice bath. The UniSols completely destroy the motel, but Deveraux and Roberts hide in a bed until they leave. The couple flees in a stolen car to a gas station, where Deveraux has Roberts remove a tracking device from his leg. They set a trap and when the UniSols arrive the gas station explodes. Colonel Perry is ordered to terminate the mission, but Scott's insanity returns, and he kills Perry and all but two doctors. Deveraux and Roberts sneak onto the command center bus and steal UniSol documents. Scott orders the rest of the mindlessly obedient UniSol team to kill Deveraux and Roberts.\n\nUsing information from the stolen documents, Roberts contacts Dr. Christopher Gregor. Gregor informs them that the UniSol project was started in the 1960s to develop the perfect soldier. Although they were able to reanimate dead humans, they could not overcome the body's need for cooling. Another major problem is that memories of the last moments of life are greatly amplified; Scott believes he is still in Vietnam fighting insurgents. When Deveraux and Roberts leave the doctor's home, police arrest them. Scott and GR76 ambush the police convoy. After a chase, the police bus and the UniSol truck both drive off a cliff and explode, killing GR76. Deveraux and Roberts head to Deveraux's family farm in Louisiana.\n\nAfter Deveraux is reunited with his parents, Scott appears and takes the family and Roberts hostage. Scott's use of muscle enhancers enables him to mercilessly beat Deveraux. Roberts escapes, only to be seemingly killed by a grenade thrown by Scott. Deveraux grabs the muscle enhancers Scott used and injects himself. Now evenly matched, Deveraux impales Scott on the spikes of a hay harvester and activates it. Roberts, who survived the explosion, embraces Deveraux.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as [[Luc Deveraux|Luc]]\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Scott\n* [[Ally Walker]] as Veronica\n* [[Ed O'Ross]] as Colonel Perry\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Woodward\n* [[Tico Wells]] as Garth \n* [[Ralf Moeller]] as GR76 (credited as Ralph Moeller)\n* [[Robert Trebor]] as the motel owner\n* [[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]] as Lieutenant\n* Drew Snyder as Charles\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Dr. Gregor\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 1990, [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] was hired to direct, and he also contributed to the screenplay. He was later replaced by [[Roland Emmerich]], who brought on his creative partner [[Dean Devlin]] to rewrite aspects of the script.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/59425|access-date=2022-02-24|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in August 1991. [[Carolco]], the company that produced the film, was having financial troubles and hoped that the film's box-office return would keep them afloat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-10/business/fi-1889_1_universal-soldier|title=Carolco Pictures Pins Hopes for Rescue on Its 'Universal Soldier'|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Willman |first=David|date=July 10, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nAt the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]], Van Damme and Lundgren were involved in a verbal altercation that almost turned physical when both men pushed each other, only to be separated. On his website, Lundgren confirmed that it was just a publicity stunt to promote the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphlundgren.com/filmography/film_universalSoldier.html|title=Official Dolph Lundgren Website: Universal Soldier (1992)}}</ref> It was the last film that used the multichannel surround-sound format, [[Cinema Digital Sound]].\n\n===Home media===\n''Universal Soldier'' was released via [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in 1992/1993 by [[Live Home Video]], and was released via [[DVD]] in 1998 by [[Artisan Entertainment]].

The film was double-featured with ''[[Universal Soldier: The Return]]'' via DVD in Norwegian by [[Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] in 2001.\n\n===Alternative ending===\nThe Special Edition DVD release features an alternative ending, which starts shortly after Scott takes Deveraux's family and Roberts hostage. As Deveraux grabs a shotgun in the kitchen, the front door opens, and he sees his mother at the door before Scott shoots her to death. In the final fight between Deveraux and Scott, Deveraux does not use Scott's muscle enhancers. Shortly after grinding Scott to death, Deveraux is shot by his father before Dr. Christopher Gregor and his men appear.\n\nGregor explains that he used Deveraux to entrap both Scott and him, and that Deveraux was staying with people posing as his parents. He then has his men shoot Deveraux, but before Deveraux dies, the police and Roberts' news crew arrive. The news crew douses Deveraux with a fire extinguisher to stabilize him while Dr. Gregor and his men are arrested. Roberts is given the microphone to cover the arrest, but she loses all composure while on the air, dropping the microphone to comfort Deveraux.\n\nSeveral days later, Deveraux is reunited with his real parents. The film ends with a eulogy narrated by Roberts, who explains that Deveraux rejected all life-prolonging medication before dying a natural death.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Universal Soldier'' opened in theaters on July 10, 1992 where it grossed $10,057,084 from 1916 theaters with a $5,249 per screen average.
