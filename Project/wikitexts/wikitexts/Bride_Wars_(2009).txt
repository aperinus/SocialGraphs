They both have made it a top priority to be married in the same location in June. While hanging out at Liv's apartment in the present day they find a Tiffany box hidden in the closet. Both friends are excited knowing that Liv will soon get a proposal from her boyfriend. That same night Emma's boyfriend proposes to her. Liv gets restless waiting for her boyfriend to pop the question and eventually confronts him the morning after Emma's engagement. He replies he was planning on doing it that night but then asks her on the spot.\n\nBoth women start planning and expect to be each other's maid of honor. They schedule a meeting with New York's most famous wedding planner, Marion St. Claire, who tells them there are three spots open at The Plaza in June: Two on the same day and one a few weeks later. They each choose a different day but due to a clerical error, wind up both scheduled to have their weddings on the same day, June 6 (three and a half months later).\n\nThe two of them ask the third bride, Stacey, to switch her June 27 date with Emma. Stacey refuses, resulting in Liv fighting with Stacey while she is registering for gifts and causing Liv and Emma to be escorted out of the store. A week of passive-aggressive hostility passes before the two women make it clear to each other that neither will compromise. Emma's fianc\u00e9, Fletcher, begins to show signs of being controlling. The two women declare war after a slight misunderstanding that Liv already announced her wedding date, outraging Emma who set her date as well, which Liv becomes aware of at their shared bridal shower. The two exchange threats and insults in front of their friends who decide not to take sides.\n\nBoth attempt to sabotage the other's wedding, including Liv changing Emma's dance instructor, Emma secretly sending Liv candy to make her too fat to fit into her dress, Liv making Emma's spray tan bright orange, and Emma changing Liv's hair dye to a shocking blue-white color, Liv registering Emma on [[Babies R Us]] and spreading rumors that she is pregnant, with the end result of Emma showing up to Liv's invite-only bachelorette party to outdance her.\n\nEmma and Fletcher get into an argument regarding Emma's maniacal behavior, sabotaging Liv's wedding and their friendship, and how Emma has changed since they first met. The couple undergoes strains in their relationship because of Emma's newfound outspokenness and self-confidence. In contrast, Liv has learned to be more sensitive and expressive. However, due to her stress about the wedding and strained friendship with Emma, she ends up being demoted from her job as an attorney.\n\nBoth brides-to-be are shown to be in the Plaza very shortly before they are due to be wed, separately. Right before Liv leaves to begin her march to the altar, she encounters Emma's father and receives his blessing; immediately she regrets setting up a wild spring break DVD to play at Emma's wedding. She sends her assistant Kevin to replace the DVD with the right one, filled with childhood memories. Thinking that the DVD is for a prank, he does not do so. Before the brides enter their respective venues, they share a brief moment of reconciliation as they both smile at each other.\n\nEmma begins her walk down the aisle but stops when the footage of her spring break is shown. She loses her temper and tackles Liv at her wedding on the other side. The two brides wrestle in their dresses on the floor to the shock of the guests, Fletcher, and Emma's parents who are standing in the doorway. Emma stands up and walks over to Fletcher who is upset at her behavior. Emma tells him that she is not the same person he fell in love with 10 years ago and that she has changed over the years. With that, the two decide to call off their wedding. Liv's wedding resumes after the two friends talk things out and reconcile. Emma, now Liv's maid of honor, is later and dancing with Nate, Liv's brother, and a well-known magazine journalist.\n\nThe film picks up a year later when Liv and Emma meet up for drinks, where it's revealed that Emma married Nate. Liv offers a toast to marriage but Emma says she's not drinking. When Liv says she's not either, it dawns on them that they are pregnant and their due dates are the same: March 3. The best friends squeal with excitement and hug happily.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Olivia \"Liv\" Lerner, a successful attorney at [[Ropes & Gray]] who is used to getting her way, and won't settle for anything else.

It was shown that she is protective and extremely caring of Emma.\n** Zoe O'Grady as Young Liv\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Emma Allan, a middle school teacher who takes care of everyone, but forgets about having some time for herself due to her sweet but slightly meek nature.

Fletcher is an accountant and the two of them met ten years prior to the film's events.

He is seen getting romantically involved with Amie near the end of the film.\n* [[June Diane Raphael]] as Amanda, a friend of Emma and Liv's who gets married at the start of the film. She is shown to be frank and expresses her regret in getting married in comical ways, ending with her and her husband getting divorced at the end of the film.\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as Stacy Kindred, another bride and one of Marion St. Claire's clients.
