See WP:PLOTSUM for general guidelines.-->\nIn the 23rd century, after more than a year's journey, the United Planets starship ''[[C-57D]]'' arrives at the distant planet [[Altair]] IV to determine the fate of an expedition sent there 20 years before. Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the original expedition's scientists, warns the ship not to land for safety reasons, but Commander John J. Adams ignores Morbius' warning.\n\nAdams and Lieutenants Jerry Farman and \"Doc\" Ostrow are met by [[Robby the Robot]], who transports them to Morbius' residence. Morbius describes how all other members of their expedition had been killed one-by-one, by an unseen \"planetary force\" and how their ship was vaporized as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes), and their daughter Altaira were somehow immune. Morbius offers to help the starship return home, but Adams says he must receive further instructions from Earth.\n\n[[File:ForbiddenPlanet1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis in ''Forbidden Planet''.]]\nThe next day, Adams finds Farman kissing Altaira. Furious, he [[Dressing down|dresses down]] Farman and criticizes Altaira for being [[naivety|naive]] and wearing revealing clothes that make her too attractive. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages  equipment aboard the starship. The next morning, Adams and Ostrow go to Morbius\u2019 residence to discuss the sabotage. While waiting, Adams happens upon Altaira swimming. After she dons a new, less revealing dress, Adams apologizes for his behavior toward her, and they kiss. They are suddenly attacked by Altaira's pet tiger, and Adams is forced to disintegrate it with his blaster.\n\nMorbius appears and tells Adams and Ostrow that he has been studying artifacts of the  [[Krell]], a highly advanced race that perished overnight 200,000 years before. One such device enhances the intellect, which Morbius had used. He barely survived, but his intellectual capacity had doubled. Another is a vast {{convert|20|mi|km}} cubical underground machine, still functioning, powered by 9,200 [[thermonuclear]] reactors. Morbius also reveals that he has discovered that just before their extinction, the Krell had been working on a project that would eliminate the need for physical instruments in their lives. Adams tells Morbius he must share these discoveries with Earth. Morbius refuses, saying \"man is not yet ready to receive such almost limitless power\".\n\nMeanwhile, back at the ship, the crew erects a [[Force field (technology)|force field]] fence around the starship, but the intruder easily passes through and murders Chief Engineer Quinn. Morbius warns Adams of his premonition of further deadly attacks. That night, the invisible intruder returns, outlined by the force field energy as the ship's multiple blasters fire at it, with no effect. The thing kills Farman and two other crewmen. When Morbius is awakened by Altaira's screams, the creature suddenly vanishes.\n\nAdams tries to persuade Altaira to leave. Ostrow sneaks away and uses the Krell intellect enhancer and is fatally injured. Before dying, he informs Adams that the Krell had in fact completed their final project. A machine that can create anything by mere thought, but the Krell forgot one thing: \"monsters from the [[Id (psychology)|id]]\". The machine gave the Krell\u2019s [[subconscious]] desires free rein with unlimited power, causing their extinction. Adams states that Morbius's enhanced subconscious had the machine create the thing that both killed the original expedition members and attacked his crewmen. Morbius refuses to believe him.\n\nAltaira tells Morbius she is leaving with Adams. Robby suddenly announces he detects something approaching from the southwest. Morbius then closes the steel shutters around his home, but the creature breaks through them with little effort. Morbius commands Robby to kill it, but the robot knows it is Morbius and shuts down. Adams, Altaira, and Morbius hide in the Krell lab, but the creature melts its way through the thick doors. Morbius accepts the truth, confronts and disowns his other self, and the Id monster vanishes, leaving Morbius fatally injured when the creature attacks him. Before he dies, he has Adams activate a planetary self-destruct system, warning them they must be far away in deep space. At a safe distance, Adams, Altaira, Robby, and the surviving crew watch the obliteration of Altair IV. Adams reassures Altaira that in about a million years, the human race will become like the Krell, and these events will remind them they are, after all, not God. They embrace as the C-57D heads for Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Dr. Edward Morbius\n* [[Anne Francis]] as Altaira \"Alta\" Morbius\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Commander John J.

According to a \"Behind the Scenes\" featurette on the film's DVD, a close look at the creature shows it to have a small [[goatee]] beard, suggesting its connection to Dr. Morbius, the only character with this physical feature. Unusually, the scene in which the Id Monster is finally revealed during its attack on the Earth ship was not created using traditional [[cel animation]]. Instead, Meador simply sketched each frame of the entire sequence in black pencil on [[animation stand]] translucent vellum paper; each page was then photographed in high contrast, so that only the major details remained visible. These images were then photographically reversed into negative and the resulting white line images were then tinted red, creating the effect of the Id Monster's body remaining largely invisible, with only its major outlines illuminated by the energy from the force-field and blaster beams.\n\n==Reception==\n''Forbidden Planet'' had its world premiere at the Southeastern Science Fiction Convention in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], on March 3 and 4, 1956.<ref name=\"warren\" /> The film opened in more than 100 cities on March 23<ref>{{Cite journal |date=March 22, 1956 |title=100 'Planet' Dates |url=https://ia802605.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/5/items/motionpicturedai79unse/motionpicturedai79unse_jp2.zip&file=motionpicturedai79unse_jp2/motionpicturedai79unse_0507.jp2&scale=2&rotate=0 |journal=[[Motion Picture Daily]] |page=3 |access-date=July 8, 2018}}</ref> in [[CinemaScope]], [[Eastmancolor]],<ref name=\"harrison's\">Film review: 'Forbidden Planet'\".

J. Stuart (the mystery novelist [[Philip MacDonald]] writing under the pseudonym), which chapters the novel into separate [[first-person narrative|first person]] narrations by Dr. Ostrow, Commander Adams, and Dr. Morbius.<ref>Stuart 1956 {{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref> The novel delves further into the mysteries of the vanished Krell and Morbius' relationship to them. In the novel, he repeatedly exposes himself to the Krell's manifestation machine, which (as suggested in the film) boosts his brain power far beyond normal human intelligence. Unfortunately, Morbius retains enough of his imperfect human nature to be afflicted with [[hubris]] and a contempt for humanity. Not recognizing his own base primitive drives and limitations proves to be Morbius' downfall, as it had for the extinct Krell. While not stated explicitly in the film (although the basis for a deleted scene first included as an extra with the [[Criterion Collection]]'s [[LaserDisc]] set and included with both the later 50th anniversary DVD and current Blu-ray releases), the novelization compared Altaira's ability to tame the tiger (until her sexual awakening with Commander Adams) to the medieval myth of a [[unicorn]] being tamable only by a [[virgin]].\n\nThe novel also includes some elements never included in the film: For one, Adams, Farman, and Ostrow clandestinely observe Morbius' house overnight one evening, but see or hear nothing.   When they leave they accidentally kill one of Altaira's pet monkeys.  When Dr. Ostrow later on dissects the dead animal he discovers that its internal structure precludes it from ever having been alive in the normal biological sense. The tiger, deer, and monkeys are all conscious creations by Dr. Morbius as companions (\"pets\") for his daughter and only outwardly resemble their Earth counterparts. The novel also differs somewhat from the film in that it does not directly establish the great machine as the progenitor of the animals or monster; instead only attributes them to Morbius' elevated mental power. The Krell's self-destruction can be interpreted by the reader as a cosmic punishment for misappropriating the life-creating power of God. This is why in the film's ending, Commander Adams says in his speech to Altaira \"... we are, after all, not God\".   The novel ends with a postscript making a similar observation.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n''Forbidden Planet''{{'}}s innovative [[electronic music]] score, credited as \"electronic tonalities\", partly to avoid having to pay any of the film industry music guild fees,<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 4, 2015 |title=Louis and Bebe Barron: Forbidden Planet at the Dawn of Electronic Music |url=https://5mag.net/features/louis-and-bebe-barron-forbidden-planet/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101132045/https://5mag.net/features/louis-and-bebe-barron-forbidden-planet/ |archive-date=January 1, 2020 |access-date=January 1, 2020}}</ref> was composed by [[Bebe and Louis Barron]]. MGM producer [[Dore Schary]] discovered the couple quite by chance at a [[beatnik]] nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]] while on a family Christmas visit to [[New York City]]; Schary hired them on the spot to compose his film's musical score. While the [[theremin]] (which was not used in ''Forbidden Planet'') had been used on the soundtrack of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), the Barrons' electronic composition is credited with being the first completely [[electronics|electronic]] film score; their soundtrack preceded the invention of the [[Moog synthesizer]] by eight years (1964).\n\nUsing ideas and procedures from the book ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]'' (1948) by the [[mathematician]] and [[electrical engineer]] [[Norbert Wiener]], Louis Barron constructed his own electronic circuits that he used to generate the score's \"bleeps, blurps, whirs, whines, throbs, hums, and screeches\".<ref name=\"MovieDiva-Forbidden-Planet\" /> Most of these sounds were generated using an electronic circuit called a [[ring modulator]]. After recording the basic sounds, the Barrons further manipulated the sounds by adding other effects, such as reverberation and delay, and reversing or changing the speeds of certain sounds.<ref name=\"MGroovesFP\">{{Cite web |title=Notes about film soundtrack and CD |url=http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/forbiddenplanetsoundtrack.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925031539/http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/forbiddenplanetsoundtrack.htm |archive-date=25 September 2009 |website=MovieGrooves}}</ref>\n\nSince Bebe and Louis Barron did not belong to the Musicians Union, their work could not be considered for an [[Academy Award]], in either the \"soundtrack\" or the \"sound effects\" categories. MGM declined to publish a soundtrack album at the time that ''Forbidden Planet'' was released. However, film composer and conductor [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose]] later published a 7-inch (18&nbsp;cm) [[single (music)|single]] of his original main title theme that he had recorded at the MGM Studios in [[Culver City, CA|Culver City]] during March 1956. Rose was originally hired to compose the musical score in 1955, but his main title theme was discarded when he was discharged from the project by Dore Schary, sometime between Christmas 1955 and New Year's Day. The film's original theatrical trailer contains snippets of Rose's score, the tapes of which Rose reportedly later destroyed.<ref>Wierzbicki 2015, p. 167.</ref>\n\nThe Barrons finally released their soundtrack in 1976 as an [[Gramophone record|LP]] [[album]] for the film's 20th anniversary; it was on their very own Planet Records label (later changed to Small Planet Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP premiered at [[MidAmeriCon]], the [[34th World Science Fiction Convention]], held in [[Kansas City, MO]], over the 1976 [[Labor Day]] weekend, as part of a 20th Anniversary celebration of ''Forbidden Planet'' held at that [[Worldcon]]; the Barrons were there promoting their album's first release, signing all the copies sold at the convention. They also introduced the first of three packed-house screenings that showed an MGM [[35mm movie film|35mm]] fine-grain vault print in original CinemaScope and stereophonic sound. A decade later, in 1986, their soundtrack was released on a music CD for the film's 30th Anniversary, with a six-page color booklet containing images from ''Forbidden Planet'', plus liner notes from the composers, Bebe and Louis Barron, and Bill Malone.<ref name=MGroovesFP/>\n\nA tribute to the film's soundtrack was performed live in concert by [[Jack Dangers]], available on disc one of the album ''[[Forbidden Planet Explored]]''.\n\n==Costumes and props==\nThe costumes worn by Anne Francis were designed by [[Helen Rose]].<ref name=\"bfi\">{{Cite web |title=Forbidden Planet (1956) |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aa6beb7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820095909/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aa6beb7 |archive-date=August 20, 2020 |access-date=August 9, 2020 |publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref> Her miniskirts resulted in ''Forbidden Planet'' being banned in Spain; it was not shown there until 1967.<ref>[http://hoycinema.abc.es/noticias/20160315/abci-sesenta-anos-desde-viera-201603142056.html \"Sesenta a\u00f1os desde que se viera la primera minifalda en la pantalla de un cine\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316113912/http://hoycinema.abc.es/noticias/20160315/abci-sesenta-anos-desde-viera-201603142056.html |date=March 16, 2016 }}.
