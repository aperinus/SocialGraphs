The film portrays US tank crews fighting in [[Germany]] during the final weeks of the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater]] of [[World War II]]. Ayer was influenced by the service of veterans in his family and by reading books such as Belton Y. Cooper's ''[[Death Traps]]'', about American armored units in World War II and the high casualty rates suffered by tank crews in Europe.\n\nProduction began in early September 2013, in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], followed by [[principal photography]] on September 30, 2013, in [[Oxfordshire]]. Filming continued for a month and a half at different locations, which included the city of [[Oxford]], and concluded on November 13. ''Fury'' was released on October 17, 2014, received positive reviews, and grossed $211 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn [[Nazi Germany]] in early April 1945, the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allies]] meet fanatical ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' resistance. Don \"Wardaddy\" Collier, a battle-hardened [[US Army]] [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|staff sergeant]] in the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]], commands a surviving [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] E8 tank nicknamed ''Fury'' and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd \"Bible\" Swan, loader Grady \"Coon-Ass\" Travis, driver Trini \"Gordo\" Garcia, and the late bow gunner \"Red\", who was killed in the previous battle, all of whom have fought together since the [[North African campaign]]. The deceased Red is subsequently replaced when ''Fury'' returns to base by [[Private First Class#United States Army|private]] Norman Ellison, a young clerk with no combat experience.\n\nAs ''Fury'' moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: He spots a team of concealed [[Hitler Youth]] but refuses to fire at the young combatants, who then ambush the platoon leader's tank with a ''[[Panzerfaust]]'', killing its entire crew. Later, Norman hesitates under fire during a skirmish and as a result, Collier finds a captured German soldier and gives Norman his [[M1917 Revolver]], ordering him to execute the prisoner. When he refuses, Collier wrestles the revolver into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman.\n\nAfter the platoon captures a small town, Collier and Norman search an apartment and encounter a frightened woman, Irma, and her younger cousin, Emma. Collier pays them for a meal and hot water while Norman and Emma begin to form a bond. Later, as the four sit down to eat, the rest of the crew drunkenly barges in. They harass the women and bully Norman until Collier angrily slams a table, enraged at their indecency. As the crew returns to the tank, German artillery hits the town, killing Irma and Emma, and angering Norman as a result.\n\nThe platoon receives orders to capture and hold a crossroads to protect the division's rear. En route, they are ambushed by a [[Tiger I]] tank, which destroys the other 3 Shermans. ''Fury'' barely manages to destroy the Tiger by outmaneuvering the slower German heavy and firing at the thinner rear hull, but takes a hit to the side while doing so, destroying the turret's powered traverse and forcing Bible to manually turn the gun. Unable to notify his superiors because the radio was damaged in the fight, Collier decides they must complete their mission rather than risk going back. Upon arriving at the crossroads, ''Fury'' is immobilized by a [[Teller mine]]. Collier sends Norman to scout a nearby hill, from which he sees a large number of ''Waffen-SS'' approaching. When informed about the approaching battalion, Collier decides to stay, informing the others they are permitted to leave if they wish. Norman volunteers to stay with Collier and the rest of the crew decides to fight as well.\n\nThe men disguise ''Fury'' to appear destroyed and hide inside. They give Norman the nickname \"Machine\" to show their acceptance of him and share a bottle of [[brandy]] together. They inflict heavy casualties on the unsuspecting Germans, but Grady is killed by a ''Panzerfaust'' fired at the tank from behind after it penetrates the hull and goes through his torso. Gordo is shot and drops a live grenade into the tank; he is subsequently killed while throwing himself onto it to protect the others. Disoriented, Bible emerges from a hatch and is killed by a [[sniper]] who also severely wounds Collier. Norman wants to surrender, but Collier warns him he will be tortured and killed. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Collier orders Norman to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop [[Stielhandgranate|grenades]] into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, and Collier is killed. Norman tries to hide in the mud underneath ''Fury'' but is spotted by a young ''Waffen-SS'' soldier who decides to move on, sparing Norman's life.\n\nThe next morning, Norman is awakened and crawls back into ''Fury''. While inside, he hears someone on top of the tank and arms himself with Collier's revolver. The hatch opens and Norman prepares to fight, but realizes that the soldier is American. As Norman is driven away he is hailed a hero by a medic; the rest of the American soldiers continue their march into the heart of Germany.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Donald \"Don\" \"Wardaddy\" Collier, tank commander\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as [[Technician Fifth Grade]] Boyd \"Bible\" Swan, tank gunner\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Norman \"Machine\" Ellison, tank assistant driver/bow gunner\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as [[Corporal#United States|Corporal]] Trinidad \"Trini\" \"Gordo\" Garc\u00eda, tank driver\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Grady \"Coon-Ass\" Travis, tank loader\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Waggoner\n* [[Brad William Henke|Brad Henke]] as [[Staff sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Davis\n* [[Jim Parrack]] as [[Staff sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Binkowski\n* [[Xavier Samuel]] as [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] Parker\n* [[Scott Eastwood]] as [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Miles\n* Kevin Vance as [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Peterson\n* [[Anamaria Marinca]] as Irma\n* [[Alicia von Rittberg]] as Emma\n* Chris Wilson as Chaplain\n* David Rae as [[Tiger I]] Commander\n* Laurence Spellman as [[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]] Dillard\n* [[Zach Avery]] as a ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' medic (uncredited)\n* Adam Ganne as an ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]''\n* Daniel Dorr as ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' Schmidt\n* Berhard Forscher as ''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' M\u00fcller\n* Edin Gali as ''[[Hauptscharf\u00fchrer]]'' Wolfe\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nOn April 3, 2013, Sony started assembling the cast for the film when [[Brad Pitt]], who previously starred in the WWII-set ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (2009), entered final talks to take the lead role of Wardaddy.<ref name=\"Brad\">{{cite news|title=Brad Pitt in Talks to Star in World War II Tank Movie 'Fury'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/brad-pitt-star-world-war-432888|access-date=29 August 2013|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=April 3, 2013}}</ref> On April 23, [[Shia LaBeouf]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"Shia\">{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Shia LaBeouf in Talks to Join Brad Pitt in WWII Thriller 'Fury'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/shia-labeouf-eyes-world-war-ii-pic-fury-with-brad-pitt-1200409503/|access-date=29 August 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=April 23, 2013}}</ref> On May 1, it was announced that [[Logan Lerman]] had also joined ''Fury''{{'}}s cast, playing Pitt's crew member Norman Ellison.<ref name=\"Logan\">{{cite news|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|title=Logan Lerman Joins Brad Pitt & Shia LaBeouf in David Ayer's 'Fury'|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/logan-lerman-joins-brad-pitt-shia-labeouf-in-david-ayers-fury/|access-date=29 December 2013|newspaper=First Showing|date=May 1, 2013}}</ref> On May 14, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] was in negotiations to play a member of Pitt's tank crew.
