He holds auditions and signs on four additional singers and a pianist. Naming themselves the \"Comedian Harmonists\", they meet international fame and popularity. However, they eventually run into trouble when the [[Nazi]]s come to power, as half the group is Jewish.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Becker]] as  Robert Biberti\n* [[Heino Ferch]] as Roman Cycowski\n* [[Ulrich Noethen]] as Harry Frommermann\n* Heinrich Schafmeister as Erich A.

This segment was cut from the American release.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film led to the writing of a musical play, ''Veronika, der Lenz ist da \u2013 Die Comedian Harmonists'', which opened at the ''Kom\u00f6die'' on the [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] in [[Berlin]] on 19 December 1997.
