It is loosely based on the 1887 novel ''[[Allan Quatermain (novel)|Allan Quatermain]]'' by [[H. Rider Haggard]]. It is the sequel to the 1985 film ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]''.\n\nThe role of [[Allan Quatermain]] is reprised by [[Richard Chamberlain]] as is that of Jesse Huston by [[Sharon Stone]], who was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Actress for this role, for which she lost to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]''. The film also starred [[James Earl Jones]] as Umslopogaas, [[Henry Silva]] as Agon, Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha, [[Cassandra Peterson]] as Queen Sorais and Chamberlain's then real-life partner Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter surviving their expedition to King Solomon's Mines, [[Allan Quatermain]] and Jesse have settled down in colonial Africa. They are engaged to be married and Jesse plans that they will travel to America for the wedding. But Allan is restless.\n\nA man chased by two strange masked men emerges from the jungle, and is recognised as one of Quatermain's friends. He is delirious and is cared for by Jesse and Allan, but at night, his pursuers return and kill him.\n\nBefore he dies, he tells Allan that his brother, supposedly lost, is alive, and that they have found the legendary 'Lost City of Gold'. Quatermain immediately starts preparing for an expedition to find his lost brother. Jesse is furious and stalks off, but then realises how important this is to Allan.\n\nAllan and Jesse are assisted by Umslopogaas, a fearless warrior and old friend of Allan's, to put together an expedition. Swarma, a spiritual guru, and five [[Askari]] warriors, accompany them. The group crosses a desert and reaches the Walls of Japora; two Askari are lost when Swarma trips a boobytrap that opens a pit under the road to the city. Another member of the party is lost when savage Eshowe warriors attack the group. Many spears are thrown at Quatermain and his friends, but Umslopogaas deflects most of them with his giant axe. The remaining askaris are lost in a subterranean river.\n\nQuatermain and his friends indeed discover the city. The inhabitants, both black and white, are friendly, and Allan meets his brother Robeson, seemingly in good health and at peace in the society. The city has two queens \u2014 the noble and beloved, Nyleptha and her power-hungry sister, Sorais. But the real leader is the evil High Priest, Agon, feared by all.\n\nAllan raises the population against Agon and Sorais, who musters an army to recover the city by force. Allan realizes that they can make all the weapons they need out of gold, which is mined by the population. The final battle ends when, atop the temple, during a lightning storm, Allan uses Umslopogaas' axe to channel the lightning and melt the gold, causing it to flow off the side of the structure and pour over the attacking horde, turning Agon and his army into gold statues.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Allan Quatermain\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Jesse Huston\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Umslopogaas\n* [[Henry Silva]] as Agon\n* [[Robert Donner]] as Swarma\n* [[Larbi Doghmi]] as Nasta\n* Aileen Marson as Queen Nyleptha\n* [[Cassandra Peterson]] as Queen Sorais\n* Martin Rabbett as Robeson Quatermain\n* Rory Kilalea as Dumont\n* George Chiota as George\n* Alex Heyns as Dutchman\n* Stuart Goakes as the trader\n* Themsi Times as the nurse\n* Philip Boucher as the bartender\n* Nic Lesley as the toothless Arab\n* Fidelis Cheza as the Eshowe chief\n* Andy Edwards as Stand-in for Richard Chamberlain\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made simultaneously with its predecessor, ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', although it was released a couple of years later. Despite the tremendous liberties both films took with the source material, being more similar in tone to the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' film series, ''Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold'' was loosely based, mostly, on the book sequel of Haggard's ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'', entitled simply ''[[Allan Quatermain (novel)|Allan Quatermain]]''. In that book, which depicts Quatermain's last adventure (although it's just the second in the series of novels), the character and his associates go searching for a lost white tribe in Africa, and end up involved in a war between the rival queens of the kingdom.\n\nAn opulent set was constructed for the film just outside [[Victoria Falls]].\n\n===Music===\nThe film features just over half an hour of original music written by Michael Linn; for financial reasons, the producers reused material composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] for the first film (although Linn's score does use Goldsmith's main theme), supplemented with music composed for other productions from [[Cannon Films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdtom.wordpress.com/2009/09/02/allan-quatermain-and-the-lost-city-of-goldlinn/|title=Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold/Linn|date=2 September 2009|website=Film Music: A Neglected Art}}</ref>\n\nThe score was initially released by Silva Screen in 1988 on a CD with cues from ''[[Manifesto (1988 film)|Manifesto]]'' (scored by [[Nicola Piovani]]), ''[[Making the Grade (1984 film)|Making the Grade]]'' ([[Basil Poledouris]]), ''[[Doin' Time on Planet Earth]]'' (Dana Kaproff) and ''The Seven Magnificent Gladiators'' ([[Dov Seltzer]]); in 2009 it was issued on its own album by La-La Land Records.

The script was written by Golan and Richard Albiston and was to be directed by Golan himself. The plot concerned Quatermain attempting to rescue his daughter from Chinese treasure hunters in the Congo. According to the 2015 documentary ''Golan: A Farewell to Mr Cinema'', [[Richard Chamberlain]] had agreed to return as the title character but Golan died before the film began shooting.\n\n==Home releases==\nMGM released the film on DVD on February 10, 2004.<ref name=\"dvdtalk1\"/>  A Blu-ray edition followed in March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/18502/allanquatermainthelostcityofgold.html|title=Allan Quatermain And The Lost City Of Gold|date=23 March 2015|first=Tom|last=Landy|website=High-Def Digest}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0092534}}\n* {{AllMovie title|120350}}\n* {{TCMDb title|id=67106}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57526|title=Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold}}\n* {{mojo title|allanquatermain}}\n* [https://archive.today/20130615084010/http://www.zonetroopers.com/5/post/2011/10/king-solomons-mines-1985\u20131986.html Zone Troopers: Website about the different Allan Quatermain and King Solomon's Mine films]\n\n{{King Solomon's Mines}}\n{{Gary Nelson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allan Quatermain And The Lost City Of Gold}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s action adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:1986 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by H.
