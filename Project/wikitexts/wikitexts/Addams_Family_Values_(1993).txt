It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (1991). The film features almost all the main cast members from the original film, including [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Raul Julia]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Carel Struycken]], [[Jimmy Workman]], and [[Christopher Hart (actor)|Christopher Hart]]. [[Joan Cusack]] plays Debbie Jellinsky, a serial killer who marries [[Fester Addams]] (Lloyd) intending to murder him for his inheritance, while teenagers [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] (Ricci) and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] (Workman) are sent to [[summer camp]]. Compared to its predecessor, which retained something of the madcap approach of the [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|1960s sitcom]], ''Addams Family Values'' is played more for very dark and [[macabre]] laughs.<ref>{{cite news | title= Charles Addams Might Grimace at This 'Family' | newspaper= LA Times | date=December 20, 1993 | url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-20/entertainment/ca-3865_1_charles-addams|access-date=2010-08-24 | first=David | last=Levy}}</ref>\n\nThe film was well received by critics, in contrast to its predecessor's mixed critical reception. However, it did not perform as well as the first film, grossing $111 million on a budget of $47 million. This was also the final film starring Julia to be released in his lifetime before his death in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Morticia Addams]] hire a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky to take care of their newborn son Pubert after his older siblings ([[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]])'s failed attempts to kill him, for which Gomez and Morticia gently rebuke them.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Debbie is a serial killer who marries rich [[bachelor]]s and murders them to [[Gold digger|collect their inheritances]]. After Debbie seduces [[Uncle Fester]], Wednesday becomes suspicious of her intentions. To maintain her cover, Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and Pugsley want to go to [[summer camp]].\n\nWednesday and Pugsley are sent to Camp Chippewa, managed by the always cheerful and lively Gary and Becky Granger, where they are singled out by the [[Camp counselor|counselor]]s and popular (and snobbish) girl Amanda Buckman for their macabre appearance and behavior. Joel Glicker, a nerdy [[bookworm]] and fellow outcast, becomes attracted to Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged.\n\nAt her bachelorette party, Debbie is repulsed by the Addams family and their relatives. On their [[honeymoon]], she tries unsuccessfully to kill Fester by throwing a [[boombox]] into the bathtub. Frustrated, Debbie forces him to cut ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester and Debbie at their home, they are removed from the premises. The Addams are alarmed to find that Pubert has transformed into a blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, blond-haired baby. [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] diagnoses this as a result of his disrupted family life and Gomez becomes horribly depressed.\n\nAt camp, the counselors cast Wednesday as [[Pocahontas]] in Gary's [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] play. When she refuses to participate, she, Pugsley, and Joel are all sent to the camp's \"Harmony Hut\" and forced to watch hours of wholesome family entertainment movies and television shows. Afterwards, the three feign cheerfulness, and Wednesday agrees to take part. However, during the performance, she reveals her deception and returns to her old self. With help from Joel, Pugsley, and the outcast campers, they capture Amanda, Gary, and Becky and set the camp on fire. Later, Wednesday and Joel share their first kiss before separating, with Joel staying behind to lead their friends to ensure the camp's permanent destruction. Pugsley and Wednesday return home in a stolen camp van.\n\nDebbie tries to kill Fester by blowing up their mansion, but he survives. She then pulls a gun and reveals she never loved him and that she was only interested in his money. [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]] helps Fester escape by knocking Debbie aside with her own car. Fester apologizes to Gomez upon his return to the Addams mansion, and Wednesday and Pugsley return, successfully reuniting the family. Debbie arrives in another car, holds the family at gunpoint, and straps them into [[electric chair]]s with the intent of killing them. As the Addamses listen sympathetically, she admits that she killed her parents and her first two husbands for incredibly frivolous and materialistic reasons. Pubert, now restored to his normal, pale, mustachioed self, escapes from his crib and reaches the rest of the family via a series of improbable events. As Debbie throws the switch to electrocute the family, he connects two loose wires that route the current through her instead. Debbie's body burns to ashes, leaving only her shoes and credit cards intact.\n\nSome time later, the Addamses and their relatives gather to celebrate Pubert's first birthday, with Joel also attending. Fester laments Debbie's loss, but soon becomes smitten with Dementia, a nanny whom Cousin Itt and his wife Margaret Alford have hired to care for their child. Out in the family graveyard, Wednesday tells Joel that Debbie was a sloppy killer, and that Wednesday would have scared her victim to death and made sure not to be caught. As Joel lays flowers on Debbie's grave, a hand emerges from the earth and grabs him, prompting Wednesday to smile as he screams.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Morticia Addams]]\n* [[Raul Julia]] as [[Gomez Addams]]\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as [[Fester Addams]]\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as [[Wednesday Addams]]\n* [[Christopher Hart (actor)|Christopher Hart]] as [[Thing (Addams Family)|Thing]]\n* [[Carel Struycken]] as [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]\n* [[Jimmy Workman]] as [[Pugsley Addams]]\n* [[Carol Kane]] as [[Grandmama (Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]] (replacing [[Judith Malina]])\n* [[John Franklin (actor)|John Franklin]] as [[Cousin Itt]]\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Debbie Jellinsky\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Margaret Alford (wife of Cousin Itt)\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Joel Glicker\n* Kaitlyn and Kristen Hooper as Pubert Addams\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Gary Granger\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Becky Martin-Granger\n* [[Mercedes McNab]] as Amanda Buckman, a camper at Camp Chippewa (McNab played the [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Scout]] in the first film)\n\n===Cameo roles===\n* Director [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and [[Julie Halston]] as the parents of Joel Glicker.\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as the police desk sergeant.

I think the first film is more romantic and the second film is funnier. Part of the reason it didn\u2019t do as well is that the marketing of the movie was so similar to the first one that people didn\u2019t think it was going to be any value-added and I really wanted to push the Pubert of it all and the Fester of it all. Instead, the whole campaign was back with the original Addams Family, so it wasn\u2019t really promising anything new. I think that\u2019s in part why it didn\u2019t do as well.
