The film stars [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Michael Cera]] as Seth and Evan, two teenagers about to graduate from [[high school]]. Before graduating, the boys want to party and lose their [[virginity]], but their plan proves harder than expected. Written by [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Evan Goldberg]], the script began development when they were 13 years old, and was loosely based on their experience in Grade 12 at [[Point Grey Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]] during the 1990s. The main characters have the same [[given name]]s as the two writers. Rogen was also initially intended to play Seth, but due to age and physical size this was changed, and Hill went on to portray Seth, while Rogen portrayed the irresponsible Officer Michaels, opposite ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' star [[Bill Hader]] as Officer Slater.\n\nUpon release, the film received positive reviews, with critics praising the dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads as well as the performances of the supporting cast. The film also proved financially successful, grossing over $170 million on a $17.5\u201320 million budget. Since the film's release, it has garnered acclaim as one of the best comedies of the 2000s and as one of the best high school movies of all time. It has been hailed as one of the defining movies of the [[Millennials|Millennial generation]].<ref>{{Cite web|date= Jul 30, 2021 | title=Why 'Superbad' Is The Greatest Millennial Comedy Of All Time| url =https://www.bosshunting.com.au/entertainment/movies/why-superbad-greatest-millennial-comedy-of-all-time|url-status=live|website=Bosshunting}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/readers-poll-the-10-funniest-movies-of-the-2000s-11901/10-the-40-year-old-virgin-222516/ | title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Funniest Movies of the 2000s | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 30, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSeth and Evan are high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood. They are about to go off to different colleges. When Seth is paired with Jules during [[home economics]] class, she invites him to a party at her house that night. Their friend Fogell reveals his plans to obtain a fake ID, so Seth promises to buy alcohol for the party with money she gives him. Evan runs into his love interest Becca and he offers to get her a specific bottle of vodka for the party.\n\nDespite Fogell's fake ID having only one name, \"McLovin\", he successfully buys the liquor, but is knocked out at the last second by a robber. When police officers Slater and Michaels arrive, Seth and Evan believe that Fogell is being arrested. In reality, the officers have agreed to give him a ride to the party.\n\nOutside, Seth is hit by a car. In exchange for Seth and Evan not telling the police, the driver, Francis, promises to take them to another party where they can get alcohol. Meanwhile, Slater and Michaels take Fogell on a ride-along and then bond with him. Despite being on duty, they start drinking, use their sirens improperly, and shoot at a stop sign.\n\nAt the party, Seth fills laundry detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol he finds in the fridge and dances with drunk Jacinda. She stains his leg with menstrual blood, while some men high on cocaine make Evan sing \"[[These Eyes]]\" for them. About to leave, Seth is confronted by the host for dancing with his fianc\u00e9e. A brawl ensues, Jacinda calls the police, while Seth and Evan escape.\n\nEvan and Seth are arguing about Evan going to a different college from Seth, before the latter is again hit by a car \u2013 the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. They plan to pin the blame of the crash on Seth himself and arrest them, but when Fogell comes out of the car, Evan makes a run for it, while Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. Eventually all three make their way to Jules' party.\n\nArriving at the party, Fogell inadvertently reveals that he and Evan will be rooming together at college, further adding to Seth's discontent towards Evan. Seth's stories of the night make him popular. Becca wants to have sex with Evan, but he respects her too much to go through with it while she is drunk.\n\nMeanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola and goes upstairs to have sex with her. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because she neither drinks nor wants Seth while he is drunk. He believes he has ruined any chance of anything with her and passes out, accidentally headbutting her and giving her a black eye.\n\nSlater and Michaels bust the party. Seth wakes up and escapes, carrying an intoxicated Evan. Slater interrupts Fogell and Nicola as they are having sex, causing her to run off. Officer Slater is angry at Fogell for ditching them, but Michaels points out they have just interrupted him, and they apologize, reconcile, and reveal they knew all along that Fogell was not 25 as the ID said; They played along, wanting to show cops can have fun too.\n\nTo make it up to him, they pretend to arrest Fogell outside to make him look \"badass.\" They resume their bonding, eventually destroying their car with a [[Molotov cocktail]] while Fogell shoots it with Slater's gun.\n\nSeth and Evan return to Evan's, where Evan admits he does not want to room with Fogell at college next year but is afraid to live with strangers. They apologize to each other before reconciling. The next day, they go to the mall where they run into Jules and Becca. Becca and Seth both apologize for their drunken behavior the previous night, and the boys pair off with the girls. Seth takes Jules to buy [[concealer]] for her black eye, while Evan and Becca leave to buy comforters, one to replace the one she ruined by vomiting on it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Seth\n** Casey Margolis as Young Seth\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Evan\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] as Fogell / McLovin\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Officer Slater\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Officer Michaels\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Jules\n* [[Martha MacIsaac]] as Becca\n** [[Laura Marano]] as Young Becca\n* [[Aviva Baumann]] as Nicola\n* [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Francis\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Mark\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Greg\n* Laura Seay as Shirley\n* Marcella Lentz-Pope as Gaby\n* [[Stacy Edwards]] as Jane\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Benji Austin\n* [[Martin Starr]] as James Masslin\n* [[Ben Best]] as Quince Danbury\n* [[Lauren Miller Rogen|Lauren Miller]] as Scarlett Brighton\n* [[Steve Bannos]] as Math Teacher \n* [[Carla Gallo]] as a Period Blood Girl (Jacinda)\n* [[Clark Duke]] as a Party Teenager\t\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Buddy at Party (uncredited)\n* [[Cortney Palm]] as Party Guest (uncredited)\n* Clement Blake as Homeless Guy\n* [[Erica Vittina Phillips]] as Mindy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Superbad'' was written by Goldberg and Rogen during their teen years. It is loosely based on their own experience as seniors in Vancouver in the late 1990s, hence the character names Seth and Evan. Other characters and references were influenced by Goldberg and Rogen's adolescence, such as Steven Glanzberg, their peer at Point Grey Secondary School, characterized in the film as a loner.<ref>{{Cite web|date=Aug 17, 2007|title=Seth Rogen's Vancouver high school misadventures hit the big screen|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/seth-rogen-s-vancouver-high-school-misadventures-hit-the-big-screen-1.668110|url-status=live|website=CBC News}}</ref> According to an interview at an event panel in 2009, Fogell was also a real friend of Rogen and Goldberg.
