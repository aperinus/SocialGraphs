A. Milne]]. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], and distributed by [[Buena Vista Distribution]] on February 4, 1966 as a double feature with ''[[The Ugly Dachshund]]''. It was the last short film produced by [[Walt Disney]], who died of lung cancer on December 15, 1966, ten months after its release. Its songs were written by the [[Sherman Brothers]] ([[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]) and the score was composed and conducted by [[Buddy Baker (composer)|Buddy Baker]].\n\nDirected by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it was the first animated featurette in the ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' film series, in which it was later added as a segment to the 1977 film ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''.\n\nIt had featured the voices of [[Sterling Holloway]] as Winnie the Pooh, [[Junius Matthews]] as Rabbit, [[Bruce Reitherman]] as Christopher Robin, [[Clint Howard]] as Roo, [[Barbara Luddy]] as Kanga, [[Ralph Wright]] as Eeyore, [[Howard Morris]] as Gopher, and [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Owl. It was narrated by [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]].\n\n==Plot==\nOne morning, [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie-the-Pooh]], a honey-loving [[Teddy bear|bear]] who lives in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], does his stoutness exercise to help improve his appetite in order to gain weight, not lose it. He sees the cupboard and notices that there is a honey pot on one of the shelves. However, he is disappointed to find that it is empty. He hears a [[bee]] fly by and decides to climb a nearby honey tree, but as he reaches the beehive, a branch he is sitting on breaks, causing him to fall into a [[gorse bush]] below. Unwilling to give up his quest for honey, Pooh visits his best friend [[Christopher Robin]] and obtains a balloon from him, intending to use it to float up to the beehive. Before doing this, Pooh first rolls around in a [[mud puddle]], hoping to trick the bees into believing he is a [[Little Black Rain Cloud]]. When he reaches the beehive, Pooh pulls out some honey and eats it without noticing that it is covered in bees who proceed to fly around in his mouth. He spits them out, kicking the queen bee into the mud puddle below. Shortly afterwards, Pooh's disguise starts to drip, and the other bees start to attack him. The queen bee angrily flies up and stings Pooh on the bottom. The sudden hit causes Pooh to swing up and down; his bottom gets stuck in the beehive, amusing the queen bee. The other bees then shove Pooh out of the beehive, before chasing both him and Christopher Robin away.\n\nStill hungry for honey, Pooh decides to visit his friend Rabbit's house. Rabbit reluctantly invites Pooh in for lunch. Pooh greedily helps himself to all the jars of honey available. He then tries to leave, but finds he is too fat to fit through the small front door. When Rabbit finds Pooh stuck in the door, he tries to push Pooh through by himself, but cannot. He rushes off to get help and returns with Christopher Robin; they both try to pull Pooh out, but fail. Christopher Robin suggests that they can get Pooh back inside if he and the others can't pull him out. But Rabbit disagrees, so Christopher Robin decides that Pooh must wait without food until he is thin again (thin enough to slip through Rabbit's front door). In the meantime, Rabbit decides to decorate Pooh's bottom so he will not have to stare at it for months. but when he tries to paint a [[moose]]'s face, the paint brush tickles Pooh and causes him to chuckle, which messes up the look. Rabbit tries converting it into a shelf instead, but then Kanga and Roo visit Pooh and give him some [[honeysuckle]] flowers. These cause Pooh to violently sneeze, completely obliterating the shelf and decorations, much to Rabbit's dismay. Rabbit is also forced to put up a \"Don't feed the bear!\" sign after Pooh tries to get honey from his friend Gopher late one night.\n\nSeveral days later, a depressed Rabbit leans against Pooh's bottom and feels him move a bit. Rabbit joyously summons Christopher Robin and his other friends to free Pooh. Everyone except Rabbit pulls from outside while Rabbit pushes from inside, without success. Rabbit finally shoves Pooh with a running start, causing Pooh to be launched into the air. He lands headfirst into the hole of another honey tree, scaring the bees away. Although his friends offer to free him, Pooh does not mind being stuck again, as he can now eat all the honey he likes.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Sterling Holloway]] as Winnie the Pooh, a [[teddy bear]] who loves [[honey]]\n*[[Junius Matthews]] as Rabbit, a [[rabbit]] who loves planting his vegetables in his garden\n*[[Bruce Reitherman]] as Christopher Robin, a seven-year-old [[boy]] and Pooh's best friend\n*[[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Owl, an [[owl]] who loves to talk about his family\n*[[Howard Morris]] as Gopher, a hardworking [[gopher]] who lives underground and often falls into his hole\n*[[Clint Howard]] as Roo, Kanga's energetic young kangaroo\n*[[Barbara Luddy]] as Kanga, a [[kangaroo]] and Roo's mother\n*[[Ralph Wright]] as Eeyore, an old grey [[donkey]] who is always losing his tail and talks in a slow, deep, depressed voice\n*[[Dallas McKennon]], [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]], [[Grace Stafford]], and [[Ginny Tyler]] as the Bees (uncredited)\n*[[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as The Narrator\n\n==Production==\n[[Walt Disney]] first learned of the Winnie the Pooh books from his daughter, [[Diane Disney Miller|Diane]]. \"Dad would hear me laughing alone in my room and come in to see what I was laughing at,\" Diane later recalled. \"It was usually the gentle, whimsical humor of A.

In June 1961, Disney acquired the film rights. By 1964, Disney told his animation staff that he was planning to make a full-length animated feature film based on the books. A meeting was held with senior staff members to discuss the proposed film. However, during the meeting, Disney decided not to make a feature film, but instead, a featurette that could be attached to a live-action film.{{sfn|Finch|2000|pp=33\u201335}}\n\nFor the first featurette, Disney and his collaborators turned to the first two chapters of the first book, \"In which we are introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and some honey Bees, and the stories Begin\", and \"In which Pooh Goes Visiting and Gets into a Tight Place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree: Behind The Very First Winnie the Pooh Film|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/08/09/history-winnie-the-pooh/|publisher=Oh My Disney|date=August 9, 2016|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh's being part of the \"decor of his home\", was not from the original book, and was reportedly contemplated by Disney when he first read the book.{{sfn|Finch|2000|p=38}} Following the mixed reception of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), he turned the project over to staff members who were nonchalant with the original stories. He selected [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] to direct the project in hopes he would Americanize the characters and include more humor. Reitherman cast his son, [[Bruce Reitherman|Bruce]], to voice Christopher Robin. The character of Gopher, who does not appear in the original stories, was added to the cast. Because other \"[[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]]\" animators were working on ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), only [[Eric Larson]] and [[John Lounsbery]] were assigned to animate the characters.

The score, which was composed by Buddy Baker, drew inspiration from [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' and had different instruments represent the characters: [[baritone horn]] for Pooh, [[bass clarinet]] for Eeyore, [[flute]] for Kanga, [[piccolo]] for Roo, [[clarinet]] for Rabbit, [[oboe]] for Piglet, [[French horn]] and [[ocarina]] for Owl, and [[bass harmonica]] for Gopher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2015/10/28/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-winnie-the-pooh/|title=8 Things You Didn't Know About Winnie the Pooh|first=Emily|last=Brandon|work=Oh My Disney|date=October 28, 2015|access-date=January 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe insight and inspiration for the Pooh songs came from an unlikely source, as is explained in the Sherman Brothers' joint autobiography, ''[[Walt's Time]]'':\n\n{{cquote|Walt (Disney) said 'Read the Pooh stories and let me know what you think.' We tried, but the stories just weren't coming through to us.  At that time designer [[Tony Walton]] was working on ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Poppins]]''. He was English born, and he was about our age, so we asked him to give us some insight on the Pooh character. His eyes lit up. 'Winnie the Pooh?', he said. 'I love Winnie the Pooh!  Of course I'll help you!' Three hours later, he was still talking about Pooh, inspiring us no end. He explained how he had been a chubby little boy, and had felt very insecure. But Winnie the Pooh was his buddy, because Pooh was pudgy and proud of it. Pooh was probably the only character in the world who exercised to gain weight! Pooh was a wonderful, lovable friend who would never let you down or turn his back on you. Soon, we started to fall in love with Pooh ourselves. Our songs for ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' were truly a love affair, thanks to [[A. A.

The first one, titled ''Walt Disney's Story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree'', also known as the \"Storyteller\" version, was released in May 1965.
