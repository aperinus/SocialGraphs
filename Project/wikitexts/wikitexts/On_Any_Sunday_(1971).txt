It was nominated for a 1972 [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20121014035102/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/158985/On-Any-Sunday/details NY Times: On Any Sunday.] ''[[The New York Times]]'' via [[Internet Archive]].

For instance, the motocross riders were typically free-spirited types, while desert racers were often loners. In Grand National racing, Brown showed widely differing personalities, such as the business-like approach to racing displayed by [[Mert Lawwill]] versus the carefree approach that [[David Aldana]] became known for.<ref name=\"Bruce Brown\">{{cite web|title=On Any Sunday|publisher=Bruce Brown Films, LLC|url=http://www.brucebrownfilms.com/sunday.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121025610/http://www.brucebrownfilms.com/sunday.htm|archive-date=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Lawwill, [[Steve McQueen]] is featured in the film, along with [[Malcolm Smith (motorcyclist)|Malcolm Smith]] and many other motorcycle racers from the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nMotorcycle brands featured in the film include [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]], [[Montesa Honda|Montesa]], [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]], [[Harley Davidson]], [[Honda]], [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], [[Suzuki]], [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]], [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka Strakonice|CZ]], [[Bultaco]], and [[Hodaka (motorcycle)|Hodaka]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film was financially backed, in part, by McQueen<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|title=On Any Sunday|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Ebert, Roger|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/on-any-sunday-1971}}</ref> through his \"Solar Productions company\", which received credit in the final seconds of the film. Some of the more dramatic shots were extreme closeup slow-motion segments of the Grand National races. From his surfing movie days, Brown was used to working with super [[telephoto]] lenses. The budget didn't allow the expense of high-speed cameras, so Brown improvised by using 24-volt batteries in the 12-volt film cameras. The result was a makeshift high-speed camera. Brown also used a [[helmet camera]] on some of the riders, which had not been widely attempted previously due to the bulk of film cameras of the day.\n\nRegarding his filming method, Brown said:\n\n<blockquote>At times I'd have a particular shot in mind. For example, I wanted to shoot a muddy motocross race and show the riders with mud all over them. First you have to be at a motocross race when it rains, then you have to find a good location to shoot. We tried and tried to get a shot with a rider caked with mud. We finally did get the shot, but for a while it seemed like we never would.</blockquote>\n\nAt one point, Brown found a perfect location for a sunset beach riding shot\u2014[[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]].\n\n<blockquote>I figured there would be no way to get approval to film on the Marine base,\" Brown recalls. \"Steve McQueen said he'd see what he could find out. The next day he called and was told to contact some General and the next thing you know we are shooting the beach sequences. It was pretty amazing the doors he was able to open.<ref name=\"Bruce Brown\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''On Any Sunday'' is often credited as the best and/or most important motorcycle documentary ever made.\"<ref name=\"Joe\">{{cite web|title=The Top 5 'Must-Watch' Motorcycle Movies|publisher=www.mc-ams.co.uk|author=Joe|url=http://www.mc-ams.co.uk/blog/top-5-must-watch-motorcycle-movies/}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] says it \"does for motorcycle racing what ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' did for surfing\". Ebert praises the film's high level of artistry in accomplishing the impressive footage of motorcycle races (which he says are difficult to film), and he also credits the film for not bothering viewers with the technical details of how the filming was done.<ref name=\"ebert\" />\n\n==Impact==\nDuring the opening sequence, children are seen riding their [[bicycle]]s on a dirt track, in imitation of motorcyclists. Thanks to this scene, ''On Any Sunday'' is thought to have popularized [[BMX]] biking across America; previously it had only been observed in Southern California.<ref>{{cite book|title=Famous Firsts|author=Rompella, Natalie|isbn=978-1-897073-55-1|year=2007|publisher=Lobster Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc-_uWnoZWwC&q=%22On+Any+Sunday%22+motorcycle&pg=PT37|page=34}}</ref> Brown himself also believed the film changed public perception of motorcycle racers from \"bad guys\" (as depicted in popular films like ''[[The Wild One]]'') to popular heroes.<ref name=\"Bruce Brown\"/>\n\nMalcolm Smith credits his appearance in ''On Any Sunday'' with giving him the worldwide recognition that enabled him to become a leading entrepreneur in the off-road motorcycling business.<ref name=\"Bruce Brown\"/>\n\nSeveral follow-ups to the film were produced:\n* ''On Any Sunday II'' (1981), starring [[Bob Hannah]] and Larry Huffman\n* ''On Any Sunday: Revisited'' (2000), by [[Dana Brown]]\n* ''[[On Any Sunday: Motocross, Malcolm, & More]]'' (2001), by [[Dana Brown]]\n* ''On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter'' (2014), by [[Dana Brown]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0067527|On Any Sunday}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090626230423/http://www.hulu.com/watch/79438/on-any-sunday ''On Any Sunday'' at Hulu]\n\n[[Category:American auto racing films]]\n[[Category:American sports documentary films]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle racing films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dominic Frontiere]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce Brown]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about auto racing]]\n[[Category:1971 documentary films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
