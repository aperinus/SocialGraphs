It was based on [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|Alexei Tolstoy]]'s 1923 [[Aelita (novel)|novel of the same name]]. [[Nikolai Tseretelli]] and [[Valentina Kuindzhi]] were cast in leading roles.\n\nThough the main focus of the story are the daily lives of a small group of people during the post-war Soviet Union, the film's enduring importance comes from its early sci-fi elements. It primarily tells of an engineer Mstislav Sergeyevich Los ({{lang-ru|\u041b\u043e\u0441\u044c}}) traveling to [[Mars]] in a rocket ship, where he leads a popular uprising against the ruling group of Elders, with the support of Queen Aelita who has fallen in love with him after watching him through a [[telescope]]. In its performances in the cinemas in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] played on the piano the music he provided for the film.\n\nIn the United States, ''Aelita'' was edited and titled by [[Benjamin De Casseres]] for release in 1929 as ''Aelita: Revolt of the Robots''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Moscow]], 1921. A mysterious wireless message is received by various stations: its text is 'Anta Odeli Uta'. Someone facetiously suggests it has come from Mars, in order to tease Los (Nikolai Tseretelli), an engineer who is obsessed with the idea of going to Mars. This inspires him to daydream about Mars and a strange civilization there. We see Aelita (Yuliya Solntseva), the queen; Tuskub (Konstantin Eggert), the actual ruler; and Ikhoshka (Aleksandra Peregonets), Aelita's mischievous maid. They live in a society where aristocrats rule over slaves who are confined underground and put into cold storage when not required.\n\nLos's wife Natasha (Valentina Kuindzhi) is pestered by Erlikh (Pavel Pol), a bourgeois playboy before the revolution who is now a dishonest minor official. He uses his connections to steal a large amount of sugar with the intention of selling it on the black market. Los, who has seen Erlikh making up to Natasha but has not seen her rejecting him, becomes jealous.\n\nLos continues to daydream: he imagines that Aelita has access to a telescope by which she can see people on Earth and has become attracted to him.\n\nSpiridonov (Nikolai Tseretelli again), an intellectual engineer and friend of Los's, is being quietly swindled by Erlikh. He disappears; a would-be detective, Kratsov (Igor Ilyinsky) (who has been rejected by the police) suspects Spiridonov to be guilty of the theft of the sugar, because of his disappearance.\n\nLos's jealousy gets out of control and he shoots Natasha: disguising himself as Spiridonov with a wig, false beard and glasses, he goes into hiding and makes plan to escape to Mars in a rocketship he has been constructing. A friend of his, Gusev (Nikolai Batalov), an ex-soldier, agrees to go with him. They take off, not knowing at first that Kratsov has stowed away (thinking he has been following Spiridonov and not realizing he's on a spaceship). Los confuses Kratsov by removing the disguise.\n\nThey land on Mars. Tuskub orders them killed, ignoring Aelita's pleas for their safety. Kratsov is taken before Tuskub and demands that the soldiers arrest the other two: he is promptly arrested. The chief astronomer comes to Aeilta and tells her where Los's ship has landed; she instructs her maid to kill him. The maid is arrested and sent to the slaves' caves - Gusev, who has taken a fancy to her, follows.\n\nAelita and Los meet and fall in love, though Los occasionally sees her as Natasha (so do we). They are arrested and sent to the caves.\n\nGusev tells the slaves of his own country's revolution and foments a revolt, which Aelita takes command of. Tuskub is overthrown and the army sides with Aelita - she commands them to fire on the workers and herd them back to the caves - she intends to rule Mars herself. Disgusted, Los kills Aelita (seeing her as Natasha as he does so).\n\nSuddenly back on Earth, it's clear that all this is a daydream. Erlikh is arrested for theft. A poster on a wall advertises a maker of tires - 'Anta Odeli Uta': the wireless message had been an advertisement. Los had not injured or killed Natasha and they make up: he burns his spaceship plans and promises to stop daydreaming.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yuliya Solntseva]] as Aelita, Queen of Mars\n* [[Igor Ilyinsky]] as Kravtsov \u2013 amateur sleuth\n* [[Nikolai Tseretelli]] as Engineer Los / Evgeni Spiridonov\n* [[Nikolai Batalov|Nikolay Batalov]] as Gusev, Red Army Soldier\n* [[Vera Georgievna Orlova|Vera Orlova]] as Nurse Masha, Gusev's Wife\n* [[Valentina Kuindzhi]] as Natasha, Los' Wife (as Vera Kuindzhi)\n* [[Pavel Pol]] as Viktor Erlich, Sugar Profiteer\n* [[Konstantin Eggert]] as Tuskub, Ruler of Mars\n* [[Yuri Zavadsky]] as Gol, Radiant Energy Tower Guardian\n* Aleksandra Peregonets as Ikhoshka, Aelita's Maidservant\n* [[Sofya Levitina]] as President House Committee\n\n==Influences==\nOne of the earliest full-length films about [[Interplanetary spaceflight|space travel]], the most notable segment remains its remarkable [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] Martian sets by Isaac Rabinovich and [[Victor Simov]] and costumes designed by [[Aleksandra Ekster]].<ref>David Elliott, \"New Worlds - Russian Art and Society, 1900-1937\", page 99.</ref> Their influence can be seen in a number of later films, including the [[Flash Gordon (serial)|''Flash Gordon'' serials]] and probably [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' and ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' and the more recent ''[[Liquid Sky]]''.\n\nParts of the plot were loosely adapted for the 1951 film ''[[Flight to Mars (film)|Flight to Mars]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[J.
