It tells the story of Akeelah Anderson ([[Keke Palmer]]), an 11-year-old girl who participates in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], her mother ([[Angela Bassett]]), her schoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee ([[Laurence Fishburne]]). The cast also features [[Curtis Armstrong]], J.R. Villarreal, Sean Michael Afable, [[Erica Hubbard]], [[Lee Thompson Young]], Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, [[Eddie Steeples]], and [[Tzi Ma]].\n\nThe film was developed over a period of 10 years by Atchison, who came up with the initial concept after seeing the 1994 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] and noting that a majority of the competitors came from well-off socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting]] in 2000, which attracted producers [[Sid Ganis]] and [[Nancy Hult Ganis]]. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]''. [[Lionsgate Films]] undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in [[South Los Angeles]] on a budget of over $6 million.\n\nAtchison remarked that his theme for the film, deemed an inspirational film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He also said that he wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African-American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizing the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.\n\nReleased in the United States on April 28, 2006, ''Akeelah and the Bee'' was positively received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline and cast, lauding Palmer's performance, although a few critics panned the story as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-American characters. The film grossed $19 million, and received a number of awards and nominations, including the [[Black Reel Awards]] and the [[NAACP Image Award]]s. Film critics highly praised it for avoiding [[Stereotypes of African Americans|African-American stereotypes]] common in Hollywood films, while scholars were less favorable, even saying it reinforces some clich\u00e9s.\n\n==Plot==\nAkeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a predominantly [[black school]] in [[South Los Angeles|South]] [[Los Angeles]]. She lives with her [[widow]]ed mother, Tanya, her three older siblings, Kiana, Devon, and Terrence, and her infant niece, Mikayla. Her principal, Mr. Welch, suggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee, which she initially refuses. After being threatened with detention for the remainder of the semester, due to her skipping school numerous times, she enters the spelling bee and wins.\n\nDr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she makes it in the regional bee when one of the finalists is disqualified for cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican-American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] middle school.\n\nAt Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a Chinese-American boy who won second place at the past two national spelling bees and is in his final year of eligibility. Contemptuous after Akeelah misspells a word, he tells her she needs a coach. Afterwards, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party, while Tanya is depressed over Terrence's bad behavior, Akeelah's grades and frequent [[truancy]], and her husband's death at the hands of a mugger five years prior. When she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee and forces her to take summer school to make up for her skipped classes. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee.\n\nAt Javier's party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in ''[[Scrabble]]''. Afterwards, Akeelah overhears Dylan's overly competitive father insulting her and berating his son for nearly losing to \"a little black girl\". During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya chastises Akeelah for going to the bee without her permission but relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his deceased daughter, Denise; she died of an unexpected terminal illness when she was younger than Akeelah. Instead, Dr. Larabee gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked around her, she would realize that she has \"50,000 coaches\". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbors to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to [[Washington, D.C.]] with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her.\n\nDuring the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win, so Akeelah attempts to [[match fixing|intentionally lose]]. Dylan, fed up with his father's competitiveness, intentionally misspells as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges until the two are declared co-champions. After Akeelah spells \"pulchritude\" (the same word she misspelled at the start of the film), she is officially declared a winner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett were the protagonists of the film along with Keke Palmer.

and the Bee'': Inspirational Story of African-American Intellect and Triumph or Racist Rhetoric Served Up On Another Platter?\" on the May 2011 issue of journal ''Multicultural Perspectives''.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} On a [[critical discourse analysis]], the authors argue that despite appearing to be an \"innocent enough\" film, it has major approaches that make it racist.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} First, it implies that African-Americans need to be rescued by others;{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=100}} second, depicts African-American communities as \"marked by homelessness, poverty, criminality, unemployment, and remnants of gang activity\";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} third, indicates that black people usually only achieve success through sports by \"linking the very essence of Akeelah's phenomenal ability to spell to her rhythmic abilities\";{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103}} and shows that African-Americans only can succeed outside their communities, \"far from the oppressive clutches of their own\".{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=104}}\n\nLinder, on her September 2011 paper \"Spelling Out Racial Difference: Moving Beyond the Inspirational Discourses in ''Akeelah and the Bee''\", also criticized it saying the film \"acts as a platform for a racial melodrama through which ideals of whiteness are reinforced and strengthened\".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=19}} Using [[Linda Williams (film scholar)|Linda Williams]]' categories of what constitutes a racial [[melodrama]], Linder argues that it is described as an \"inspirational\" film because of \"[its] portrayal of Akeelah's victimization by the black community that surrounds her\" and of redemption only achieved \"through the idealized discourse of young people's educational success as defined by dominant (white) culture\".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=22}} Linder said characters \"are mostly represented as having 'no interest in escape' from societal oppressions and limitations\" and that \"there is no sign throughout the film of any kind of lasting change for Akeelah's school or her young peers\".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}}\n\nLinder affirms that it creates a dichotomy between \"success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)\".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=30}} Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee as the one who makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of [[African American Vernacular English]].{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that \"legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual\".{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=101}} Another contraposition commented by scholars was \"between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother\".{{sfn|Linder|2011|p=28}} Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as \"an African-American obstructionist\",{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}} while scholar Gloria Ladson\u2010Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of \"ignorant Black woman\".{{sfn|Ladson\u2010Billings|2009|p=93}} Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the \"[[white savior narrative in film|white authority figure saves the underclass child]]\" plotline by introducing Larabee,<ref name=fuchs/> Ladson\u2010Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not.{{sfn|Pimentel|Sawyer|2011|p=103-104}}{{sfn|Ladson\u2010Billings|2009|p=93}} After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is \"a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture and who
