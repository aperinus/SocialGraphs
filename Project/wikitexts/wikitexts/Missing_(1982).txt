Stewart]], adapted from the book ''The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice'' (1978) by [[Thomas Hauser]] (later republished under the title ''Missing'' in 1982), based on the disappearance of American journalist [[Charles Horman]], in the aftermath of the [[United States]]-backed [[Chilean coup of 1973]], that deposed the democratically elected [[socialist]] President [[Salvador Allende]].<ref name=\"Wolf\"/>\n\nIt stars [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Melanie Mayron]], [[John Shea]], [[Janice Rule]] and [[Charles Cioffi]]. Set largely during the days and weeks following Horman's disappearance, the film examines the relationship between Horman's wife [[Joyce Horman|Beth]] and his father [[Edmund Horman|Edmund]] and their subsequent quest to find Horman.\n\n''Missing'' was theatrically released on February 12, 1982 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success, grossing $16 million on a $9.5 million budget. The film premiered at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]] where it was jointly awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] (along with the Turkish film ''[[Yol]]''), while Lemmon won the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor prize]]. It received four nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Lemmon), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek) and won [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film created significant controversy in [[Chile]] and was banned during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s dictatorship, even though neither Chile nor Pinochet is ever mentioned by name (although the Chilean cities of [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] are).<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | date=January 1, 1982 | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/missing-1982 | publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | website=RogerEbert.com|title=Missing (1982) | access-date=March 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEd Horman (Jack Lemmon) arrives in Chile to search for his son Charlie (John Shea), who worked as a journalist and disappeared during the recent [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. Ed meets his daughter-in-law, Beth (Sissy Spacek), with whom he has a strained relationship and they fight over politics. Ed blames his son and daughter-in-law's radical political views for Charlie's disappearance, while Beth blames the American government. Ed uses his connections to meet with various government officials to find out the truth about his son's disappearance.\n\nAs he investigates, Ed finds that the American [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] is not as helpful as he thought they would be and he suspects them of hiding information about Charlie. One U.S. diplomat is polite and friendly but constantly lies to him; a high-ranking American military attache is blunt and tells Ed that whatever happened to Charlie was his own fault, noting \"You play with fire, you get burned.\" Together, he and Beth learn that the U.S. had many interests in the country that have been enhanced by the coup and its aftermath and that many military officials aided [[Pinochet]] in the coup. As Ed becomes disillusioned with the American government, he comes to respect the work Beth and Charlie were doing and he and Beth reconcile. When they receive proof that Charlie was murdered by the [[Military junta|junta]] and that the U.S. let it happen, he tells the embassy officials \"I just thank God we live in a country where we can still put people like you in jail!\"\n\nThe film ends with a postscript stating that after his return to the United States, Ed received the body of his son Charlie seven months later, making an [[autopsy]] impossible, and that a subsequent lawsuit against the US government was dismissed. It also adds that the [[State Department]] denies its involvement in the Pinochet coup, a position maintained to the present day.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as [[Joyce Horman|Beth Horman]] \n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as [[Edmund Horman|Edmund \"Ed\" Horman]]\n* [[Melanie Mayron]] as Terry Simon\n* [[John Shea]] as [[Charles Horman|Charles \"Charlie\" Horman]]\n* [[Charles Cioffi]] as [[Captain (nautical)|Capt.]] Ray Tower, [[United States Navy|USN]]\n* [[David Clennon]] as [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] Phil Putnam\n* [[Richard Venture]] as [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. Ambassador]]\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Sean Patrick\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Andrew Babcock\n* [[Joe Regalbuto]] as [[Frank Teruggi]]\n* [[Keith Szarabajka]] as David Holloway\n* John Doolittle as David McGeary\n* [[Janice Rule]] as Kate Newman\n* [[Ward Costello]] as [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]]\n* [[Hansford Rowe]] as [[United States Senate|Senator]]\n* [[Tina Romero]] as Maria\n* Richard Whiting as Statesman\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in Mexico<ref name=\"Canby\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/12/movies/missing-by-costa-gavras.html |title='MISSING' BY COSTA-GAVRAS |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=12 February 1982 |access-date=17 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> with a budget of $9.5 million from [[Universal Studios]], marking Costa-Gavras' most expensive production.<ref name=\"Wolf\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe [[film score|score]] is by the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Electronic music|electronic]] composer [[Vangelis]]. The movie's piano theme has been used extensively in commercials, but an official release of the film's [[soundtrack]] has not yet occurred. The main theme appeared first on Vangelis' 1989 album ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]''. The main theme is also available on the Festival de Cannes (60th Anniversary) compilation of famous soundtracks. A bootleg release of the soundtrack exists. A sung version with lyrics by Tim Rice has been recorded by [[Elaine Paige]] and [[Nana Mouskouri]]. A 7-inch single was released by Polydor in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Vangelis-Missing/master/466170|title=Vangelis \u2013 Missing|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Missing'' was released in theaters on February 12, 1982, in limited theaters and was released widely on March 12, 1982, in 733 theaters. It ranked at #3 at the box office, grossing $2.3 million. In its first week, it grossed $5.5 million. In its second weekend, it landed at #5, making $1.8 million. For its second week, it made $2.3 million. After 49 days and 7 weeks in theaters, the film made between $14<ref name=\"BOM\"/> and $16<ref name=numbers/> million in the US.\n \nThe film was released on both [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]], in 1982 and 1987, by MCA Videocassette, MCA Videodisc, and MCA Home Video respectively. The VHS version was pulled from the market due to the lawsuit filed against director Costa-Gavras. [[Universal Home Video]] re-released ''Missing'' on [[DVD]] in 2004, following the dismissal of the lawsuit. A special edition DVD was released by [[The Criterion Collection]] in October 2008.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn 1983, a year after the film's theatrical release, both the film (then in the home video market) and [[Thomas Hauser]]'s book ''The Execution of Charles Horman'' were removed from the United States market following a [[lawsuit]] filed against Costa-Gavras and [[Universal Pictures]]'s (then) parent company [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] by former ambassador [[Nathaniel Davis]] and two others for libel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/davis-v-costa-gavras-2|title=Davis v.
