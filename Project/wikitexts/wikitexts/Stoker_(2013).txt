Starring [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Matthew Goode]], and [[Nicole Kidman]], it was released on March 1, 2013.<ref name=release/> The film is dedicated to producer [[Tony Scott]], who died after production.\n\n==Plot==\nOn her 18th birthday, India Stoker, a girl with a strong acuteness of the senses, is left with her unstable mother Evelyn after her loving father Richard dies in a car accident. At Richard's funeral, Evelyn and India are introduced to Richard's charismatic younger brother Charlie, who has spent his life traveling the world. India, who didn't know Charlie existed, is perturbed by his presence. He announces that he is staying indefinitely to help support India and Evelyn, to Evelyn's delight and India's chagrin.\n\nShortly after, India witnesses Charlie argue with Mrs. McGarrick, the head caretaker of the house. Mrs. McGarrick complains to Charlie that she has been his \"eyes and ears\" since he was a boy. Mrs. McGarrick then disappears. Charlie and Evelyn grow intimate while India continues to rebuff his attempts to befriend her. India's great aunt Gwendolyn visits the family, to Evelyn and Charlie's dismay. Gwendolyn shows surprise at Charlie's claims of traveling the world and tells Evelyn that she needs to talk to her about Charlie. Gwendolyn changes hotels due to an unexplained fear and suspicion of Charlie. She loses her cell phone and tries to call the Stokers' home from a phone booth, but Charlie arrives and strangles her to death with his belt. Meanwhile, India discovers Mrs. McGarrick's body in the freezer and realizes Charlie is a murderer.\n\nIndia unleashes her inner aggression at school and stabs a bully, Chris Pitts, in the hand with a pencil after he tries to land a punch to her head. This draws the attention of another classmate, Whip Taylor. At home, India witnesses Evelyn and Charlie growing intimate. She wanders off to a local diner where she runs into Whip. She and Whip go into the woods, where they proceed to make out, until India aggressively bites his lip. Whip attempts to rape India before Charlie intervenes and breaks Whip's neck with his belt while Whip's body lies on top of India. India aids Charlie in burying the body in her garden. She attempts to call Gwendolyn, but hears her phone ring in the garden, realizing Charlie killed her too. While showering, India [[masturbate]]s to the memory of the murder, climaxing as she remembers Charlie breaking Whip's neck.\n\nWhile going through Richard's office to gather things of his she wants to keep, India discovers that a key she received as a birthday present belongs to a locked drawer to Richard's desk. Inside, she finds dozens of letters Charlie wrote to her over the years, which detail his travels and his love for his niece, although they have never met. However, she sees that the sending address is a [[mental institution]]. She confronts Charlie, who explains the truth: Charlie killed his and Richard's younger brother Jonathan as a child by burying him alive in a sandbox because he was jealous that Richard paid more attention to him. He was then put in a mental institution. When released on India's 18th birthday, Richard gave Charlie a car, money, and an apartment in [[New York City]] on the condition that he stay away from Richard's family. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Charlie bludgeoned Richard to death with a rock and staged the car accident.\n\nIndia is shocked and angered, but Charlie explains he has come for her and gives her a birthday present, a pair of [[stiletto heel]]s, to replace her more childish [[saddle shoe]]s. She seemingly forgives Charlie and grows closer to him after he provides an alibi for her when Sheriff Howard questions her about Whip's disappearance. They grow close to intimate before Evelyn witnesses them. Charlie tells India that, after waiting until she came of age, he wants her to come to New York with him. Later, Evelyn coldly expresses her desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie, implying that she knows the truth about Richard's death and Charlie's institutionalization. Charlie seduces Evelyn and then attempts to strangle her with a belt, but India fatally shoots him in the neck with her [[rifle]]. She buries Charlie's body in the backyard, then leaves for New York in his car.\n\nIndia is pulled over for speeding by Sheriff Howard, who asks her why she's in a hurry. She replies that she wanted to catch his attention, then stabs him in the neck with a pair of [[pruning shears]]. She pursues the bleeding sheriff into a field to shoot him with her rifle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as India Stoker\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Charlie Stoker\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Evelyn Stoker\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Richard Stoker\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Gwendolyn \"Gin\" Stoker\n* [[Lucas Till]] as Chris Pitts\n* [[Alden Ehrenreich]] as Whip Taylor\n* [[Phyllis Somerville]] as Mrs. McGarrick\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Sheriff Howard\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Doctor Jacquin\n* [[Harmony Korine]] as Mr. Feldman\n\n==Production==\n[[Wentworth Miller]], mostly known as an actor, wrote the screenplay for ''Stoker'', as well as a prequel, ''Uncle Charlie''.<ref name=sdcc2010/> He used the [[pseudonym]] Ted Foulke for submitting his work, later explaining \"I just wanted the scripts to sink or swim on their own.\"<ref name=ML100724/> On the 2010 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]], a list of the best unproduced screenplays then making the rounds in Hollywood, ''Stoker'' finished in the top 10.<ref name=MF101213/> Miller described it as a \"[[horror film]], a family drama and a [[psychological thriller]]\".<ref name=sdcc2010/> Although influenced by [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'',<ref name=yahoo080126/> Miller clarified that ''Stoker'' was \"not about [[vampire]]s. It was never meant to be about vampires but it is a horror story. A [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]] is one who stokes, which also ties in nicely with the narrative.\"<ref name=sdcc2010/> [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' also influenced the film. Miller said: \"The jumping-off point is actually Hitchcock's ''Shadow of a Doubt''. So, that's where we begin, and then we take it in a very, very different direction.\"<ref name=sdcc2010/>\n\nThe film marked director [[Park Chan-wook]]'s English-language debut. In January 2011, it was reported that [[Mia Wasikowska]] was in negotiations to play India,<ref name=stokerneg/> and in February, [[Nicole Kidman]] also entered negotiations to join the cast.<ref name=latstoker/> Back in June 2010, before Wasikowska and Kidman were ultimately cast, both [[Carey Mulligan]] and [[Jodie Foster]] were reported to be in talks to star in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Matt|title=Carey Mulligan in Talks to Star in 'Stoker'; Jodie Foster to Possibly Co-Star|url=https://collider.com/carey-mulligan-stoker-jodie-foster-wentworth-miller/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=June 28, 2010|language=en}}</ref> In June 2011, it was reported that [[Matthew Goode]] was in talks to play Charlie,<ref name=var110608/> after [[Colin Firth]], who was attached earlier, had to drop out.<ref name=ew110913/> [[Jacki Weaver]], [[Lucas Till]], [[Alden Ehrenreich]], [[Ralph Brown]] and [[Dermot Mulroney]] joined the cast in July and August 2011.<ref name=DL110727/><ref name=wrap110728/><ref name=var110801/><ref name=thr110810/>\n\nFilming took 40&nbsp;days<ref name=sd130206/> beginning in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], in September 2011.<ref name=sd110901/> The motel scenes were filmed in nearby [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] on 22 September, and additional scenes were shot in [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]], home of the [[University of the South]].<ref name=sd110901/><ref name=hitfix/> Principal photography wrapped on 23 October.\n\nComposer [[Philip Glass]] was originally hired to compose the film's score but was replaced by [[Clint Mansell]].<ref name=FMR120602/> Two of Glass' compositions for piano are still included in the finished film however, as revealed in the movie credits.\n\n==Hitchcock influence==\nIn addition to screenwriter Wentworth Miller stating that the film was influenced by ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', there are a number of Hitchcock's themes, plot devices and motifs used within it. Both Matthew Goode's character and [[Joseph Cotten]]'s character in ''Shadow of a Doubt'' share the name \"Uncle Charlie\", as well as Hitchcock's use of [[Themes and plot devices in the films of Alfred Hitchcock#The likeable criminal, aka the charming sociopath|the likeable criminal]]. The complexly intertwined relationship that develops between Uncle Charlie and India also references Hitchcock's use of [[Themes and plot devices in the films of Alfred Hitchcock#The double|the double]] with the young Charlie and Uncle Charlie in ''Shadow of a Doubt''. Many of Uncle Charlie and India's key interactions occur on a [[Themes and plot devices in the films of Alfred Hitchcock#Staircases|staircase]], which is a Hitchcock motif also used in ''Shadow of a Doubt''. There is a pivotal scene in ''Stoker'' that takes place near a train track and the rumbling train makes an aural intrusion,<ref>{{cite web|last=Weis|first=Elisabeth|title=Aural Intrusion and the Single-Set Films|url=http://www.zx.nu/ss/chapter1.htm|work=The Silent Scream|publisher=zx.nu|access-date=20 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728065045/http://www.zx.nu/ss/chapter1.htm|archive-date=28 July 2011}}</ref> which plays into Hitchcock's use of [[Themes and plot devices in the films of Alfred Hitchcock#Trains|trains]] as a sexual [[euphemism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-meanings-of-movie-trains/|title=The meanings of movie trains|first=Aliya|last=Whiteley|work=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=September 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\n{{RT data|prose|consensus=Its script doesn't quite carry the dramatic heft of his earlier work, but Park Chan-wook's ''Stoker'' showcases his eye for sumptuous imagery and his affection for dark, atmospheric narratives populated by mysterious characters.|ref=yes}} {{Metacritic film prose |score=58|count=42|ref=yes|access-date=May 22, 2022}}\n\nThe film [[Film premiere|premiered]] at [[2013 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and the reviews were mostly positive. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', critic Jeremy Kay called the film \"a gorgeously mounted family mystery dressed up as a gothic fairytale\", and said the film presents viewers with clues worthy of Hitchcock: \"Literary references and symbolism abound in ''Stoker''. You can get tied up trying to figure out who is what. That is the idea. All the clues are there.
