Based on the 1989 [[Wild at Heart (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Barry Gifford]], it tells the story of Sailor Ripley (Cage) and Lula Pace Fortune (Dern), a young couple from [[Cape Fear, North Carolina]], who go on the run from Lula's domineering mother and the gangsters she hires to kill Sailor.\n\nLynch was going to produce, but after reading Gifford's book, he decided to write and direct as well. He did not like the ending of the novel and thus decided to change it to fit his vision of the main characters. ''Wild at Heart'' is a [[road movie]] which includes [[allusion]]s to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Elvis Presley]] and his movies.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite news | last=Pearson | first=Matt | title=''Wild at Heart'' | publisher=The British Film Resource | year=1997 | url=http://www.britishfilm.org.uk/lynch/wild_at_heart.html | access-date=2008-01-26}}</ref>\n\nEarly test screenings for ''Wild at Heart'' had a poor reception; Lynch estimated that 300 people walked out of an early screening.<ref>{{cite book | author=Chris Rodley |title=Lynch on Lynch|year=1997 | publisher =Faber and Faber|isbn=9780571178339|page=202}}</ref> On release, the film had mixed critical reviews and grossed $14 million against its $10 million budget.

It has since been positively re-evaluated by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nLovers Lula and Sailor are separated after he is jailed for killing a man who attacked him with a knife; the assailant, Bobby Ray Lemon, was hired by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune. Upon Sailor's release, Lula picks him up outside prison, where she hands him his [[snakeskin]] jacket. They go to a hotel where she reserved a room, make love and go to see the [[speed metal]] band [[Powermad]]. At the club, Sailor gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of the [[Elvis Presley]] song \"[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]\". Later, back in their hotel room, after making love again, Sailor and Lula finally decide to run away to [[California]], breaking Sailor's [[parole]]. Marietta arranges for private detective Johnnie Farragut\u2014her on-off boyfriend\u2014to find them and bring them back. But unbeknownst to Farragut, Marietta also hires gangster Marcello Santos to track them and kill Sailor. Santos's minions capture and kill Farragut, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled [[psychosis]].\n\nUnaware of all of the events happening back in [[North Carolina]], Lula and Sailor continue on their way until they witness\u2014according to Lula\u2014a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dying in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts 'old friend' Perdita Durango, who might be able to help them, although she secretly knows Lula's mother has a contract out for his murder. While Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailor's child. While Sailor is out, Peru enters the room and threatens to sexually assault Lula, forcing her to ask him to have sex with her, before leaving, stating he has no time. This traumatizes Lula, who was raped as a child.\n\nThe robbery goes spectacularly wrong when Peru unnecessarily shoots the two clerks. Peru then admits to Sailor that he has been hired to kill him, and Sailor realizes he has been given a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is about to kill him when the sheriff's deputy opens fire on him and Peru blows his own head off with his own shotgun. Sailor is arrested and sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nWhile Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Upon his release, Lula decides to reunite with him. Rejecting her mother's objections over the phone, she throws water over her mother's photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son. When they meet Sailor, he reveals he will be leaving them both, having decided whilst in prison that he is not good enough for them. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor encounters a gang who surround him. He insults them, and they quickly knock him out. While unconscious, he sees a vision in the form of [[Glinda the Good Witch]], who tells him, 'Don't turn away from love, Sailor.' When he awakens, Sailor apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, and then runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta, in Lula's house, sizzles and vanishes. As there is a traffic jam on the road, Sailor begins to run over the roofs and hoods of the cars to get back to Lula and their child in the car. Sailor sings \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\" to Lula, having earlier said that he would only sing that song to his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as \"Sailor\" Ripley: the actor described his character as \"a kind of romantic Southern outlaw\".<ref name=\"Gelder\">{{cite news|last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|title=At the Movies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 17, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/17/movies/at-the-movies.html |access-date=2010-03-10}}</ref> Cage said in an interview that he was \"always attracted to those passionate, almost unbridled romantic characters, and Sailor had that more than any other role I'd played.\"<ref name=\"Gelder\"/> Prior to being cast in the film, Cage had met Lynch several times at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], which they both frequented.
