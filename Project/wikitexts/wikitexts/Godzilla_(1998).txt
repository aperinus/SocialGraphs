The footage featured Western actors and merged it with the original Japanese footage in order to appeal to American audiences.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=25}} ''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]'' was the first ''Godzilla'' film to be co-produced between a Japanese studio (Toho) and an American studio ([[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]]).{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=121}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=84}}}} The film stars [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Jean Reno]], [[Maria Pitillo]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]], and [[Harry Shearer]].

In the South Pacific Ocean, a Japanese fishing vessel is suddenly attacked by a giant creature, with only one fisherman surviving. Dr. Niko \"Nick\" Tatopoulos, an [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] scientist, is in the [[Chernobyl exclusion zone]] researching the effects of radiation on wildlife, but is interrupted by an official from the [[U.S. State Department]]. In [[Tahiti]], a mysterious Frenchman questions the [[PTSD|traumatized]] survivor over what he witnessed, who repeatedly replies \"[[Godzilla|Gojira]].\" Nick is sent to Panama and Jamaica to study a trail of wreckage leading to the recovered Japanese fishing ship with massive claw marks on it. Nick identifies skin samples he discovered in the shipwreck as belonging to an unknown species. He dismisses the military's theory of the creature being a living dinosaur, instead deducing it is a mutant created by nuclear testing.\n\nThe creature travels to New York City, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The city is evacuated before the [[U.S. military]], on Nick's advice, lure the creature into revealing itself with a large pile of fish. Their attempt to kill it fails, however, and only causes further damage before it escapes. Nick collects a blood sample, and by performing a pregnancy test, discovers the creature reproduces asexually and so is collecting food for its offspring. Nick also meets up with his ex-girlfriend, Audrey Timmonds, a young aspiring news reporter. While she visits him, she uncovers a classified tape in his provisional military tent concerning the monster's origins and turns it over to the media. She hopes to have her report put on TV as to launch her career, but her boss, Charles Caiman, uses the tape in his report, declaring it his own discovery, and dubs the creature \"[[Zilla (Godzilla)|Godzilla]].\"\n\nAs a result, Nick gets removed from the operation and he disowns Audrey, before getting kidnapped by the mysterious Frenchman Philippe Roach\u00e9. Revealing himself as an agent of the [[Directorate-General for External Security|French secret service]], Philippe explains that he and his colleagues have been closely watching the events to cover up their country's role in the nuclear testing that created Godzilla. Suspecting a nest somewhere in the city, they cooperate with Nick to trace and destroy it. Meanwhile, Godzilla resurfaces and dives into the [[Hudson River]] to evade a second attempt by the military to kill it, where it is attacked by [[United States Navy|Navy]] submarines. After colliding with torpedoes, Godzilla sinks, believed to be dead by the authorities.\n\nNick and Philippe's team, followed by Audrey and her cameraman Victor \"Animal\" Palotti, find the nest inside [[Madison Square Garden]], with over 200 eggs. The eggs begin to hatch and the strike team are attacked by the offspring. Nick, Animal, Audrey and Philippe take refuge in the Garden's broadcast booth and successfully send out a live news-report to alert the military. A prompt response involving an airstrike is initiated as the four escape moments before the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bomb the arena.\n\nAudrey and Nick reconcile, before the adult Godzilla, having survived, emerges from the Garden's ruins. Enraged by the deaths of its brood, it takes its rage out on the four, chasing them across Manhattan. After a taxi chase, they manage to trap Godzilla within the cables of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], allowing the returning Air Force to shoot it. Godzilla dies from its wounds, and the remaining citizens and authorities celebrate. Audrey tells Caiman that she quits working for him after what he has done, before leaving with Nick. Philippe, taking a tape Animal was recording and promising to return it after removing certain contents, thanks Nick for his help and parts ways. In the ruins of Madison Square Garden, a single surviving egg hatches and the hatchling roars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Dr. Niko \"Nick\" Tatopoulos\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Philippe Roach\u00e9\n* [[Maria Pitillo]] as Audrey Timmonds\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Victor \"Animal\" Palotti\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Colonel Hicks\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Mayor Ebert\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Charles Caiman\n* [[Arabella Field]] as Lucy Palotti\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Dr. Elsie Chapman\n* Lorry Goldman as Gene\n* [[Doug Savant]] as Sergeant O'Neal\n* [[Malcolm Danare]] as Dr. Mendel Craven\n* [[Ralph Manza]] as Joe \"Fisherman Joe\"\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Kyle Terrington\n* [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as General Hunter Anderson\n* [[Richard Gant]] as Admiral Phelps\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Japanese Tanker Skipper\n* [[Nancy Cartwright]] as Caiman's Secretary\n* Gary A.

Prior to their hiring, Elliott and Rossio were searching for their next project and were offered ''Godzilla'' by their advisor Cary Woods. The duo initially declined the offer several times, Elliott recalled, \"We actually turned the project down about two or three times because we weren't sure we knew what to do with it.\" Woods eventually convinced them to discuss the project with TriStar. Elliott and Rossio wrote a three and half-page story outline that secured their employment. Rossio believes that they were offered the project due to their experience in writing \"franchise-type titles.\" Robert Fried expressed support for Elliott and Rossio, praising them as \"talented sci-fi buffs\" and stating, \"We\u2019ve put a lot of time, thought and finance into the screenplay.\" Toho's character restrictions helped inspire Elliott and Rossio in finding the tone of the script, Elliott stated, \"Toho insisted we not make light of the monster. That helped us find the right tone as well as the social and political implications.\"<ref name=\"p1\"/>\n\nThe duo wanted to avoid a comic-like approach and instead take the material seriously with a \"legitimate science fiction story\" that would evoke feelings of \"mystified or scared or awe-inspired\" for audiences. Rossio wanted to create a balance in anthropomorphizing Godzilla, not wanting to stray from Godzilla's humanistic personality but not humanize him entirely. The duo approached Godzilla as something that audiences would fear yet root for. Elliott found the \"key\" to the story after a friend, who was also a Godzilla fan, expressed that he found Godzilla not to be a \"good guy\", but a territorial beast, Elliott stated, \"And that, to me, meant that you could actually present Godzilla on the side of the angels but he could still be a monster.\"<ref name=\"p1\"/>\n\nThe duo chose to add small details to make Godzilla seem \"more realistic\", such as the nictitating eyelid. The duo took inspiration from ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' for the story concept. As the story developed, they found that the Ahab archetype would be more interesting if it were a woman who lost her husband to Godzilla. Elliott described the story to be about obsession, redemption and \"inappropriate grief response.\" The duo also wanted to deliver a story that satisfied fans by adapting Godzilla's characterization from the first few Toho films, Elliott stated, \"In one movie it does what the first three Toho films did \u2013 it takes him from being a horrendous threat to being defender of the Earth.\" Elliott and Rossio submitted their first draft on November 10, 1993. Woods and Fried were satisfied with the script, with Fried praising it for being \"respectful of the organic origins of Godzilla, in some ways a homage to US-Japanese relations.\"<ref name=\"p1\"/>\n\nAfter De Bont joined the project, Elliott and Rossio revised the script based on his notes. Amongst the changes made to the first draft were the 12-year gap condensed to a year; Jill accompanies Keith to the Arctic site; Keith first notices Godzilla's teeth buried in ice instead of his claws; The alien probe crashes in Traveller, Utah instead of Kentucky.<ref name=\"p1\"/> Elliott and Rossio remained on the project after De Bont left and completed their final rewrites in spring 1995. Prior to hiring a new director, TriStar hired [[Don Macpherson]] to rewrite the Elliott/Rossio script. Prior to his hiring, Macpherson was working on ''[[Possession (2002 film)|Possession]]'' until he received a call from his agent with an offer to work on ''Godzilla''. Macpherson \"immediately accepted\" due to being a fan of the Toho ''Godzilla'' films.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nMacpherson met with Marc Platt, the then-President of TriStar, to discuss the film. The studio was concerned with the film's proposed $120&nbsp;million budget, later revised to $200&nbsp;million. De Bont insisted that all of the film's effects be entirely digital, Macpherson noted, \"The problem was that, in this version of the movie, it was all effects. Godzilla was in virtually every scene. So everything was an SFX scene.\" Macpherson was tasked with rewriting the script to match TriStar's \"ideal\" budget of $80&nbsp;million. Prior to rewriting the script, he requested to meet with the production crew to pinpoint which scenes were deemed the most expensive. The production crew reported that the three main problems that were considered \"difficult and costly\" were Godzilla's size, Godzilla's interaction with water, and Godzilla's interaction with masonry.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nMacpherson was shown [[storyboard]]s, concept art, and designs from De Bont's version. However, he did not keep these ideas in mind, feeling that such elements would change depending on the budget. Instead, Macpherson used the Toho ''Godzilla'' design as a reference when rewriting the script. He noted that the project had transitioned into a film that turned directors away, stating, \"they said they wanted strong, creative directors. But they wanted them as a kind of \u2018badge\u2019 of creative excitement and had no intention of allowing them their freedom.\"<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nWhile Macpherson called Elliott and Rossio's original script \"terrific,\" he took issue with several of its ideas. He felt that the script discarded the \"Japanese element of post-war nuclear politics\" from the Toho films, leaving Godzilla as a threat to a single country rather than the world, Macpherson added, \"That neglected the poetic aspect of fear and wonder from the original Toho movies, and the idea of a prior \u2019sin\u2019 which had caused the mutation and revenge of Godzilla.\" He felt that the script lacked proper characters and \"had too many extra sequences which didn't deliver.\" He also took issue that the script never developed Godzilla as a character and treated him similar to [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]], though he suspected De Bont was responsible for this portrayal.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nMacpherson felt that the script's depiction of Godzilla was \"relentless\", noting, \"very much a Godzilla POV, so you neither identified with Godzilla nor with the scientists trying to protect the world.\" He also took issue that the first half of the script was driven by destruction and by the script's mid-point, there was \"monster fatigue\" and no \"encore,\" stating, \"So I thought the audience would be fatigued and ready for something new \u2013 and the new thing wasn't delivered.\" Macpherson attempted to resolve that issue while retaining the highlights of Elliott and Rossio's script.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nIn November 2018, an unofficial digital graphic novel adaptation of Elliott and Rossio's unproduced ''Godzilla'' script was released online. Entitled ''Godzilla '94'', the graphic novel features artwork by Todd Tennant, who worked with Rossio on the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2018/11/12/complete-godzilla-94-graphic-novel-debuts-online-this-thanksgiving/|title=Complete Godzilla '94 Graphic Novel Debuts Online This Thanksgiving|work=SciFi Japan|access-date=November 12, 2018|archive-date=November 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113075755/http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2018/11/12/complete-godzilla-94-graphic-novel-debuts-online-this-thanksgiving/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Emmerich and Devlin===\nPrior to the release of ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', director [[Roland Emmerich]] and producer [[Dean Devlin]] signed on to the project in May 1996 under the condition they would be able to handle the film their way, Devlin stated, \"I told Sony that I would do the film but on my own terms, with Godzilla as a fast-moving animal out of nature, rather than some strange kind of creature.\"{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=85}} Emmerich and Devlin were the first filmmakers approached by then-TriStar executive Chris Lee to do ''Godzilla'' but initially turned the offer down, Devlin stated, \"Both of us thought it was a dopey idea the first time we talked. When Chris came back to us, we still thought it was a dopey idea.\"{{sfn|Bart|2000|p=107}}\n\nDespite praising Elliott and Rossio's script, Emmerich discarded it, stating, \"It had some really cool things in it, but it is something I never would have done. The last half was like watching two creatures go at it. I simply don't like that.\" Emmerich instead decided to develop new ideas from scratch, stating, \"I didn't want to make the original ''Godzilla'', I wanted nothing to do with it. I wanted to make my own. We took part of [the original movie's] basic storyline, in that the creature becomes created by radiation and it becomes a big challenge. But that's all we took. Then we asked ourselves what we would do today with a monster movie and a story like that. We forgot everything about the original ''Godzilla'' right there.\"<ref name=\"p4\"/>{{sfn|Aberly|1998|p=25}}\n\n====Creature design====\n[[File:G98 artwork.jpg|thumb|right|Tatopoulos showed this concept drawing (his personal favorite) to Emmerich and Devlin at Cannes 1996 which convinced them to move forward with the project.]]\nEmmerich decided to completely reinvent Godzilla's design because he thought the original Toho design \"didn't make sense\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/roland-emmerich-white-house-down_n_3500037.html|title=Roland Emmerich, 'White House Down' Director, Explains Who And What We'll See In 'Independence Day 2' (Not Boomer)|last=Ryan|first=Mike|work=Huffington Post|date=June 26, 2013|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-date=October 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002094546/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/26/roland-emmerich-white-house-down_n_3500037.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Emmerich also discarded the previous design approved by Jan de Bont, stating, \"I saw the creature that they designed for [TriStar's first attempt]. Jan De Bont created a Godzilla that was very close to the original, but it was not right because today we wouldn't do it like that.\"{{sfn|Dawson|1998|p=118}}\n\n[[Patrick Tatopoulos]] was hired by Emmerich to design Godzilla. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast.<ref name=Rickett2006/> Godzilla, originally conceived as a robust, erect-standing, [[plantigrade]] reptilian sea monster, was reimagined by Tatopoulos as a lean, [[digitigrade]] bipedal iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground. Godzilla's color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment.<ref name=Rickett2006>{{cite book |title=Designing Movie Creatures and Characters: Behind the Scenes With the Movie Masters |last=Rickitt |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=0-240-80846-0 |pages=74\u201376 }}</ref> At one point, it was planned to use [[motion capture]] from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it ended up looking too much like a human in a suit.<ref>{{cite book| last = Rickitt| first = Richard| title = Special Effects: The History and Technique| publisher = Billboard Books| year = 2000| isbn = 0-8230-7733-0| page = 174}}</ref>\n\nTatopoulos thought the designs that Ricardo Delgado, Crash McCreery and Joey Orosco provided for Jan de Bont took the design in a wrong approach, stating, \"What they did which was a mistake in my mind was, rather than going in a new direction they tried to alter and make the old one better. And when you do that, first of all I think it's very disrespectful. It's more disrespectful for me to alter something existing than to take a fresh new direction.\" Tatopoulos took inspiration from the design of Shere Khan used in Disney's version of ''The Jungle Book'' in terms of Godzilla's chin, stating, \"One of the inspirations was a character I loved as a kid, the tiger in Jungle Book, Shere Khan. He had this great chin thing and I always loved it; he looked scary, evil but you respected him. I thought, let's try to give him a chin and I felt it still looked realistic but he had this different thing that you hadn't seen before.\"<ref name=\"p4\"/>{{sfn|Aberly|1998|p=27}}\n\nTatopoulos created four concept art pieces and a 2-foot tall maquette for a meeting with Toho. Tatopoulos and Emmerich attended the meeting to pitch their Godzilla to then Toho chairman Isao Matsuoka, ''Godzilla'' film producer [[Shogo Tomiyama]], and Godzilla special effects director [[Koichi Kawakita]]. They unveiled Tatopoulos' artwork and maquette and the Toho trio remained silent for a few minutes, Emmerich recalled, \"They were speechless, they stared at it, and there was silence for a couple minutes, and then they said, \u2018Could you come back tomorrow?\u2019 I thought for sure we didn't have the movie then.\" Tomiyama later recalled that \"It was so different we realized we couldn't make small adjustments. That left the major question of whether to approve it or not.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/13/entertainment/ca-3197|title='Godzilla' Returns Home Something of a Stranger|last=Reitman|first=Valerie|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 13, 1998|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-date=March 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315032330/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/13/entertainment/ca-3197|url-status=live}}</ref> Even though Tomiyama was not allowed to remove the artwork and maquette from the studio premise, Tomiyama visited ''Godzilla'' producer and creator [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]], whose failing health prevented him from attending the meeting, to explain Tatopoulos' design, stating, \"I told him, \u2018It's similar to [[Carl Lewis]], with long legs, and it runs fast'.\" The following morning, Matsuoka approved the design, stating that Tatopoulos \"kept the spirit of Godzilla.\"<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\n====Writing====\nDespite receiving approval from Toho, TriStar had yet to green-light the film. Emmerich and Devlin wrote the script on spec, with the condition that the screenplay would return to the filmmakers if the studio did not immediately approve it. Emmerich and Devlin wrote the first draft in five and a half weeks at Emmerich's vacation house in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Emmerich and Devlin decided to abandon the Atlantis origin established in Elliott and Rossio's script in favor of the radiation origin established in the Toho films, Devlin stated, \"In some of the early drafts of the script by others, they had Godzilla being an alien planted here. What Japan had originally come up with regarding nuclear radiation \u2013 you can't abandon that. It's too important to what Godzilla is all about.\" Emmerich and Devlin also decided to treat their Godzilla more animal-like than monstrous, Tatopoulos stated, \"We were creating an animal. We weren't creating a monster.\"{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=334}} Emmerich and Devlin also decided to give their Godzilla the ability to burrow underground, Devlin stated, \"We discovered that certain kinds of lizards can burrow, so we decided to give him that capability.\"<ref>Sean Mitchell, ''The Return of Godzilla'' (May 17, 1998) Los Angeles Times</ref> Chameleon-like skin change was also considered but abandoned later during production.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nEmmerich and Devlin also abandoned Godzilla's iconic atomic breath in favor of a \"power breath\", where their Godzilla would simply blow objects away by exhaling a strong wind-like breath. However, news of the power breath leaked before the film's release, which outraged fans and forced Emmerich and Devlin to make last minute changes on scenes involving the power breath, effects supervisor Volker Engel stated, \"Dean and Roland wanted this monster to retain a certain menace and credibility, but Godzilla's breath is something everyone expects to see at some point, so they came up with instances in which you would see something like the old breath, but with a kind of logic applied to it. We make the assumption that something in his breath, when it comes in contact with flame, causes combustive ignition. So you get this flame-thrower effect, which causes everything to ignite.\"{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=101}} As a way to make their Godzilla a threat to mankind, Emmerich and Devlin also gave their Godzilla the ability to lay hundreds of eggs (via parthenogenesis) and rapidly spawn offspring that could spawn offspring of their own and quickly overrun the planet. The first draft was submitted to Sony on December 19, 1996, then-President of Sony Pictures John Calley forwarded the script to Bob Levin of marketing to brainstorm marketing ideas.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\n====Pre-production====\nTriStar green-lit the film soon after Emmerich and Devlin's completion of the first draft, bestowing complete creative freedom to write, produce, and direct on the filmmakers, while the studio managed financing, distribution and merchandising deals. The deal also enabled Emmerich and Devlin to receive 15% [[first-dollar gross]] on the film while the original producers Cary Woods and Robert Fried would be given executive producer credits. Instead of employing Digital Domain as Jan de Bont planned for his Godzilla, Emmerich and Devlin decided to use their own effects team such as Volker Engel as the film's visual effects supervisor,  Joe Viskocil as miniature effects supervisor, Clay Pinney as mechanical effects supervisor, and William Fay as executive producer of the team.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\nViewpoint DataLabs created a digital model of Godzilla, nicknamed \"Fred\", for scenes that required a digital rendition of the monster. For scenes that required practical effects, Tatopoulos' studio created a 6th-scale animatronic model of Godzilla's upper-body as well as a 24th-scale Godzilla suit donned by stuntman Kurt Carley.<ref name=\"p4\"/> The filmmakers favored CG over practical effects and as a result, the final film features 400 digital shots, 185 of which feature Godzilla, and only two dozen practical effects used in the final film.<ref name=\"p4\"/>\n\n====Filming====\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 1, 1997, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on September 26, 1997, filming took place in New York City, and moved to Los Angeles in June.<ref>{{cite news | last = Allstetter | first= Rob | date = August 1997 | title = Look Out, it's Godzilla! | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 119\u2013120}}</ref> Scenes in New York were filmed in 13 days; tropical scenes were filmed in the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2013/04/story-notes-trivia-godzilla/ |title=Story Notes for Godzilla |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |access-date=January 22, 2014 |archive-date=December 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204060748/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2013/04/story-notes-trivia-godzilla/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United States Marine Corps]] participated in the filming of the movie.

While initially we reacted negatively to that, once we understood their thinking behind it, it became completely acceptable to us.\"{{sfn|Aberly|1998|p=23}} 300 companies signed an agreement not to show the full image of Godzilla before the film's release. Prior to principal photography, Emmerich filmed a [[teaser trailer]], budgeted at $600,000, that featured Godzilla's foot crushing the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex at a museum.
