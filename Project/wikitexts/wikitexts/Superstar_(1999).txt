The movie is directed by former ''[[The Kids in the Hall (TV series)|Kids in the Hall]]'' member [[Bruce McCulloch]]. It stars Molly Shannon, [[Will Ferrell]], [[Harland Williams]], and [[Elaine Hendrix]]. ''SNL'' and ''Kids in the Hall'' alum [[Mark McKinney]], who appeared in many of the Mary Katherine Gallagher ''SNL'' skits on TV, also has a minor role as a priest. Molly Shannon received a nomination for [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]] Entertainment Award \"Favorite Actress - Comedy\" but lost out to [[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]] in ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAs a child, Mary Katherine Gallagher rescues a boy with a distinctive birthmark at the public pool. An orphan, she lives with her grandmother, and becomes obsessed with achieving \u201csuperstardom\u201d and having her first kiss.\n\nAt St. Monica\u2019s [[Catholic]] high school, Mary dreams of kissing Sky Corrigan, the most popular boy in school, but her awkwardness brands her a social outcast. Caught kissing a tree, she is placed in [[special education]], where she befriends Helen Lewengrub, and new \u201cbad boy\u201d student Eric Slater takes an interest in her.\n\nA school [[talent show]] is announced with the chance to win a trip to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and be a [[extra (acting)|movie extra]]. Mary\u2019s grandmother forbids her from participating, but Helen urges her to audition anyway, as does a vision of [[Jesus]]. When she tries to sign up, Mary finds herself in an altercation with head cheerleader Evian Graham, Sky\u2019s girlfriend. Mary\u2019s grandmother reveals the true reason she will not let Mary perform \u2013 Mary\u2019s parents were stomped to death during an [[Irish stepdance]] competition.\n\nHaving witnessed the fight with Mary, Sky breaks up with Evian, who swears revenge on Mary. Auditioning for the talent show, Mary performs an impassioned rendition of \u201c[[Sometimes When We Touch]]\u201d. Evian dumps a bucket of paint on her, inspired by ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''; humiliated, Mary flees the school with Slater. He brings her to the pool, revealing that he was the boy she saved years ago, and they bond during an impromptu swim. Returning home, Mary finds her grandmother has been informed that Mary earned a place in the talent show. Finally allowing her to perform, Mary's grandmother coaches her and a chorus line of her special education classmates.\n\nAs the talent show begins, Evian apologizes to Mary, revealing she and Sky will be dancing together. Mary resolves to perform not to impress Sky, but for herself. In a last-minute [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], Mary relinquishes her dream of becoming a star, instead asking to survive the performance for her grandmother\u2019s sake. Mary and her friends perform to \u201c[[Out Here on My Own]]\u201d as Slater, summoned by another vision of Jesus, arrives just in time to watch. The record player inadvertently speeds up, and Mary falls \u2013 echoing her parents\u2019 fatal performance \u2013 but, encouraged by Jesus, she successfully leads her friends through their performance.\n\nMet with a standing ovation, Mary wins the talent show. Sky kisses her, but she rejects him, and kisses Slater. The film ends as Mary, now dating Slater, again kisses the tree.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as [[Mary Katherine Gallagher]]\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Sky Corrigan/[[Jesus]]\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Eric Slater\n* [[Elaine Hendrix]] as Evian Graham\n* [[Mark McKinney]] as Father Tylenol Ritley\n* [[Glynis Johns]] as Grandma Gallagher (in her last film role)\n* [[Jason Blicker]] as Howard\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Father John Insomnic\n* Emmy Laybourne as Helen Lewengrub\n* [[Jennifer Irwin]] as Maria\n* [[Rob Stefaniuk]] as Thomas Smith\n* [[Natalie Radford]] as Autumn Winters\n* [[Karyn Dwyer]] as Summer Falls\n* [[Tom Green]] as Dylan\n* [[Chuck Campbell]] as Owen\n\n==Reception==\n''Superstar'' received negative reviews from film critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 32% based on reviews from 74 critics, with the consensus: \"Dumb script and flat jokes made this another ''SNL'' misfire.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Superstar (1999) | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1093874-superstar/ | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 42% based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Superstar |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/superstar |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"C+\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/U1RBUg== |title= Movie Title Search: STAR |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190809143716/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/U1RBUg== |archive-date= 2019-08-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film one star out of four, writing: \"Here is a portrait of a character so sad and hapless, so hard to like, so impossible to empathize with, that watching it feels like an act of unkindness.\" He furthermore described Shannon's character as \"hostile\" and \"not very nice\", stating that \"She's one of those people who inspires in you the inexplicable desire to be hurtful and cruel\".<ref>{{cite web | date = October 8, 1999 | title = Superstar | author = Roger Ebert | author-link = Roger Ebert | url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/superstar-1999 }}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'', who gave the film two out of four stars, said that \"Molly Shannon is a likable, energetic performer\" and some of the jokes were \"actually funny\", but there would still not be \"enough here to justify a feature-length movie\". He also felt the film's attempts \"at developing Mary into something more than a two-dimensional caricature\" were pointless since \"the script doesn't show any respect for her\".<ref>{{cite web | title = ReelViews Reviews Superstar | author = James Berardinelli | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/superstar.html }}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine gave a positive review, calling the film a \"pleasant surprise\" as he expected only mediocrity from another ''Saturday Night Live'' adaptation. He said it is \"amusing\" but \"uneven\", suggesting it might build good word of mouth and do well but would be unlikely to reach the commercial success of ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''.<ref>{{cite web | date = Oct 8, 1999 | title = Variety Reviews Superstar | author = Dennis Harvey | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117752228 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Superstar (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0167427}}\n* {{Mojo title|superstar|Superstar}}\n\n{{Saturday Night Live}}\n{{Bruce McCulloch}}\n{{Lorne Michaels}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Superstar}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live films]]\n[[Category:Saturday Night Live in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce McCulloch]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lorne Michaels]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
