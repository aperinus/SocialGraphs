It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jean Reno]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Sean Bean]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]]. The film is about a team of former special operatives hired to steal a mysterious, heavily guarded briefcase while navigating a maze of shifting loyalties. The film was praised for its realistic car chases in [[Nice]] and [[Paris]].\n\nFrankenheimer signed to direct Zeik's screenplay, which Mamet rewrote to expand De Niro's role and develop plot details, in 1997. The film was photographed by [[Robert Fraisse (cinematographer)|Robert Fraisse]] in his native France from November 3, 1997, to March 3, 1998. Professional racing car drivers coordinated and performed the vehicle stunts, and [[Elia Cmiral]] scored the film, his first for a major studio.\n\n''Ronin'' premiered at the [[1998 Venice Film Festival]] before its general release on September 25. Critics were generally positive about the film's action, [[casting (performing arts)|casting]], and technical aspects, while the plot attracted criticism. The film performed moderately well at the box office, grossing $70.7 million on a budget of $55 million. ''Ronin'', Frankenheimer's last well-received feature film,<ref name=\"tcm\"/> was considered to be a return to form for the director. Film critic and historian [[Stephen Prince]] called the film Frankenheimer's \"end-of-career masterpiece\".{{sfn|Pomerance|Palmer|2011|p=87}} The car chases, which were favorably compared with those in ''[[Bullitt]]'' and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'',<ref name=\"keeling\">{{cite web|last1=Keeling|first1=Robert|title=Looking back at Ronin|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/looking-back-at-ronin/|website=Den of Geek!|date=April 16, 2018|location=United Kingdom|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|access-date=May 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508150016/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/ronin/55292/looking-back-at-ronin|archive-date=May 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"magid\">{{cite magazine |last=Magid |first=Ron |title=Samurai Tactics |magazine=[[American Cinematographer]]|issn=0002-7928 |date=October 1998 |url=https://theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg1.htm |access-date=May 15, 2013 |page=1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928150536/https://theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg1.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2017}}\n* {{cite magazine |last=Magid |first=Ron |title=Samurai Tactics |magazine=American Cinematographer|issn=0002-7928 |date=October 1998 |url=https://theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg2.htm |access-date=May 15, 2013 |page=2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113141942/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg2.htm |archive-date=November 13, 2006|ref=none}}\n* {{cite magazine |last=Magid |first=Ron |title=Samurai Tactics |magazine=American Cinematographer|issn=0002-7928 |date=October 1998 |url=https://theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg3.htm |access-date=May 15, 2013 |page=3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113141946/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg3.htm|archive-date=November 13, 2006|ref=none}}\n* {{cite magazine |last=Magid |first=Ron |title=Samurai Tactics |magazine=American Cinematographer|issn=0002-7928 |date=October 1998 |url=https://theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg3.htm |access-date=May 15, 2013 |page=4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113141949/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/oct98/ronin/pg4.htm|archive-date=November 13, 2006|ref=none}}\n</ref> were included on several media outlets' lists as among the best depicted on film.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\nAt a bistro in [[Montmartre]], [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] operative Deirdre meets with two Americans, Sam and Larry, and a Frenchman, Vincent. She takes them to a warehouse where the Englishman Spence and the German Gregor are waiting. Conversations between the men show that they are all ex-government agents or ex-military-turned-mercenary. Deirdre briefs them on their mission: to attack a heavily armed convoy and steal a large, metallic briefcase, which functions as the film's [[MacGuffin]]. Its contents are never revealed. The team's first task before the main mission is to acquire weapons; this turns into a setup. Although the team survives and they get the weapons, Spence is exposed as a fraud by Sam. He is dismissed by Deirdre and the others continue the mission. As the team prepares, Deirdre meets with her handler, Seamus O'Rourke, who tells her that the [[Russian mafia]] is bidding for the case and that the team must intervene before they get it. During a [[stakeout]], Sam and Deirdre act on their mutual attraction.\n\nDeirdre's team successfully ambushes the convoy at [[La Turbie]] and pursues the survivors to [[Nice]]. During the gunfight, Gregor steals the case and disappears. He negotiates selling it to the Russians, but his contact attempts to betray him. Gregor kills the contact, then has Mikhi \u2014 the Russian Mafioso in charge of the deal \u2014 agree to another meeting. The team tracks Gregor through one of Sam's old [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contacts and corners him in the [[Arles Amphitheatre]] during his meeting with two of Mikhi's men. Sam chases Gregor; Gregor flees but is caught by Seamus. Deirdre and Vincent confront the two Russian thugs, causing a shootout. Sam arrives to help, killing one, but catches a [[ricochet]] from the other when Vincent knocks away the thug's gun in order to kill him. Seamus kills Larry and escapes with a reluctant Deirdre and the captured Gregor. Vincent takes Sam to a villa owned by his friend, Jean-Pierre. After removing the bullet and letting Sam recuperate, Vincent asks Jean-Pierre to help them find Gregor and the Irish operatives.\n\nIn [[Paris]], Gregor is persuaded through violent interrogation to give the case back to Seamus and Deirdre. After retrieving it from a post office, they are pursued by Sam and Vincent in a high-speed chase. Vincent shoots out their tire, sending their car off an unfinished overpass. Gregor escapes with the case while road workers rescue Deirdre and Seamus from the burning vehicle. Unsure where to go next, Sam and Vincent decide to track down the Russians; one of Jean-Pierre's contacts tells them they are involved with figure-skater (and Mikhi's girlfriend) Natacha Kirilova, who is appearing at [[Z\u00e9nith Paris|Le Z\u00e9nith]].\n\nDuring Natacha's performance, Mikhi meets with Gregor, who says a sniper in the arena will shoot Natacha if Mikhi betrays him. Mikhi surprises Gregor by letting Natacha be killed before killing Gregor and taking the case. Amid the ensuing chaos from Natacha's shooting, Sam and Vincent leave the arena just in time to see Seamus kill Mikhi and steal the case. Sam and Vincent split up; Vincent pursues Seamus, but is wounded in a gunfight. Sam finds Deirdre waiting in a getaway car; he convinces her to leave after explaining that he is still an active government agent working undercover to get Seamus, not the case. As she drives away, Seamus is forced to return to the arena as Sam gives chase. Seamus ambushes Sam, but is shot dead by Vincent before Seamus can kill Sam.\n\nSam and Vincent have coffee in the bistro where they first met. A radio broadcast announces that a [[Good Friday Agreement|peace agreement]] between [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] has been reached, partially as a result of Seamus's death. Sam keeps glancing at the door as patrons enter, but Vincent convinces Sam that Deirdre will not be coming back. They shake hands and part ways; Sam drives off with his CIA contact as Vincent pays the bill and leaves.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:DeniroRenoMcElhoneSkarsBeanPryce.png|thumb|Top-billed cast of ''Ronin'': (''clockwise from top left'') Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Sean Bean, Natascha McElhone and Jonathan Pryce]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Sam Regazolli, an American mercenary formerly associated with the [[CIA]].<ref name=\"travers\"/> According to director [[John Frankenheimer]], De Niro \"was always dream casting\" for the film.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Vincent, a French gunman who befriends Sam.<ref name=\"wapo\"/>{{sfn|Pomerance|Palmer|2011|p=79}} Frankenheimer sought to establish the friendship between Reno's and De Niro's characters, which he considered pivotal to the story, and wanted to strengthen the off-screen bond between the actors.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Deirdre, an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] operative commissioned to steal a briefcase by Seamus O'Rourke.{{sfn|Pomerance|Palmer|2011|p=79}}<ref name=\"tvguide\"/> An on-set dialect coach helped McElhone speak with a [[Ulster English|Northern Ireland accent]].<ref name=\"commentary\"/> McElhone said she was thrilled to play the role because she portrayed a character that moved the action forward.<ref name=\"fast\"/>\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Spence,  an Englishman who purports to be a firearms specialist formerly associated with the [[Special Air Service|SAS]].<ref name=\"keeling\"/>{{sfn|Armstrong|2008|p=157}} During production, Frankenheimer did not know what the future held for the character and considered having him killed off-screen after the team drives out of the warehouse, or snatched from a Paris street into a van driven by the IRA.

Hanan on ''George Wallace'' and ''[[The Burning Season (1994 film)|The Burning Season]]'' (1994), and costume designer May Routh on ''[[Andersonville (film)|Andersonville]]'' (1996).<ref name=\"prod\"/> Frankenheimer chose French cinematographer [[Robert Fraisse (cinematographer)|Robert Fraisse]] to help him achieve the look and style he wanted for the film. Fraisse impressed Frankenheimer with his work on the police thriller ''[[Citizen X]]'' (1995), which persuaded the director Fraisse could handle the more-than-2,000 setups he planned for ''Ronin''.<ref name=\"magid\"/> [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]] served as the film's producer.<ref name=\"fleming\"/>\n\nAccording to Frankenheimer, French authorities helped him circumvent a strict Paris ordinance that prohibited film productions from firing guns in the city. This was enacted because many civilians had been complaining about the gunfire noise produced by film shoots. Additional factors influenced the decision; officials' desire for an American action film like ''Ronin'', few of which had been filmed there since the law was passed, to be filmed in Paris and the desire to boost France's reputation as a filming location.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nWriter John David Zeik, a newcomer to film,<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web |last=Harrison |first=Eric |title=Mamet Versus Writers Guild, the Action Thriller Sequel |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 5, 1998 |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-aug-05-ca-10109-story.html |access-date=May 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911230246/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/05/entertainment/ca-10109 |archive-date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> conceived the idea for ''Ronin'' after reading [[James Clavell]]'s novel ''[[Sh\u014dgun (novel)|Sh\u014dgun]]'' at the age of 15.<ref name=\"prod\">{{cite web|title=''Ronin'': About the Production|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=301|website=Cinema Review|access-date=October 28, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020924090320/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=301|archive-date=September 24, 2002}}</ref> It gave him background information on ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' (masterless samurai), which he incorporated into a screenplay years later. On choosing France as the story's key location, Zeik said: \"Many years later in Nice, the location of one of the key set pieces of the story, I stared into the sun and saw the silhouettes of five heavily armed [[Gendarmerie|Gendarmes]] crossing the [[Promenade des Anglais]]. That image made me realize that I wanted to set the film in France.\"<ref name=\"prod\"/>\n\nAccounts differ as to the screenplay's authorship. According to Zeik's attorney, Playwright [[David Mamet]] was brought in shortly before production to expand De Niro's role and add a female love interest. Although Mamet rewrote several scenes, his contributions were minor according to Zeik's account. Frankenheimer said Mamet's contributions were more significant: \"The credits should read: 'Story by J.D. Zeik, screenplay by David Mamet'. We didn't shoot a line of Zeik's script.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/> Frankenheimer later retracted this in a September 1998 [[open letter]] published in ''Variety'', writing that \"J.D. Zeik is unequivocally entitled to the first position screenwriting credit as well as the sole story credit he was awarded by the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]]&nbsp;...

[[Michael Lonsdale]]'s character elaborates on the analogy in an anecdote about the [[Forty-seven r\u014dnin|forty-seven ''r\u014dnin'']] told with [[miniature art|miniatures]], comparing the film's characters to the 18th-century ''r\u014dnin'' of Japan.{{sfn|Armstrong|2008|p=158}} In his essay, \"Action and Abstraction in ''Ronin''\", [[Stephen Prince]] wrote that the ''r\u014dnin'' metaphor explores themes of \"service, honor, and obligation to complex ways by showing that service may entail betrayal and that honor may be measured according to disparate terms\".{{sfn|Pomerance|Palmer|2011|p=83}} According to Stephen B.
