After getting a ride, he arrives at a roadside diner in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Nevada]]. Another customer in the diner plays a song on the [[jukebox]], one that disturbs Al, for it reminds him of his former life in [[New York City]]. He remembers a time there when he was bitter about squandering his musical talent working in a cheap nightclub. After his girlfriend Sue Harvey, the nightclub's lead singer, quits her job and leaves to seek fame in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], he becomes depressed. After some anguish, Al decides to travel to [[California]] to see Sue and marry her. With little money, though, he is forced to hitchhike his way across the country.\n\n[[File:Detour (1945).webm|thumb|thumbtime=10|right|Play full film; runtime 01:07:57.]]\n\nIn [[Arizona]], [[Bookmaker|bookie]] Charles Haskell Jr. gives Al a ride in his convertible and tells him that he is in luck; he is driving to [[Los Angeles]] to place a bet on a horse. During the drive, he has Al pass him pills on several occasions, which he swallows as he drives. That night, Al drives while Haskell sleeps. When a rainstorm forces Al to pull over to put up the convertible's top, he is unable to rouse Haskell. Al opens the passenger-side door and Haskell tumbles out, falling to the ground and striking his head on a rock. Al then realizes the bookie is dead. It is likely that Haskell died earlier from a heart attack, but Al is certain that if he calls the police, they will arrest him for killing Haskell. Al hides the body in the brush. He takes the dead man's money, clothes, and identification, and drives away, intent on abandoning the car near Los Angeles.\n\nAl crosses into California and spends a night in a motel. The next day, as he leaves a gas station near [[Desert Center Airport]], he picks up a hitchhiker, Vera. At first, she travels silently with Al, who has identified himself as Haskell, then suddenly challenges his identity and ownership of the car. She reveals she had been picked up by Haskell earlier in [[Louisiana]]; she got out in Arizona after he tried [[Sexual assault|to force himself on her]]. Al tells her how Haskell died, but she [[blackmail]]s him by threatening to turn him over to the police. She takes the money that Al retrieved from Haskell's wallet and wants whatever money they can get by selling the car.\n\nIn Hollywood, they rent an apartment, posing as Mr. and Mrs. Haskell, to provide an address when they sell the car. When they are about to sell the car, Vera learns from a newspaper that Haskell's wealthy father is near death and a search is under way for his long-estranged son. Vera demands that Al impersonate Haskell and position himself to inherit the estate. Al refuses, arguing that impersonation requires detailed knowledge he lacks.\n\nBack at the apartment, Vera gets drunk and they begin arguing again. In a drunken rage, she threatens to call the police, running into the bedroom with the telephone and locking the door, falling on the bed with the telephone cord tangled around her neck. From the other side of door, Al pulls on the cord to try to disconnect the phone. When he breaks down the door, he discovers he has inadvertently strangled Vera. Al gives up the idea of contacting Sue again and returns to hitchhiking instead. He later finds out that Haskell is wanted in connection to the murder of Vera, \"his wife.\" Back in the diner in Reno where the film opened, he imagines his inevitable arrest.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:detour1.jpg|thumb|right|Ann Savage and Tom Neal]]\n* [[Tom Neal]] as Al Roberts\n* [[Ann Savage (actress)|Ann Savage]] as Vera\n* [[Claudia Drake]] as Sue Harvey\n* [[Edmund MacDonald]] as Charles Haskell Jr.\n* [[Tim Ryan (actor)|Tim Ryan]] as the Nevada Diner Proprietor\n* [[Esther Howard]] as Holly, Diner Waitress\n* [[Don Brodie]] as the Used Car Salesman\n* Pat Gleason as Joe, truck driver\n\n==Production==\nIn 1972, Ulmer said in an interview that the film was shot in six days. However, in a 2004 documentary, Ulmer's daughter Arianne presented a shooting script title page which noted, \"June 14, 1945-June 29.

The soundtrack is also fully realized, with ambient backgrounds, motivated sound effects, and a carefully scored original musical soundtrack by [[Leo Erdody]], who had previously worked with Ulmer on ''[[Strange Illusion]]'' (1945). Erdody took extra pains to underscore Vera's introduction with a sympathetic theme, giving the character a light musical shading in contrast to her razor-sharp dialogue and its ferocious delivery by Savage.\n\nThe film was completed, negative cut, and printed throughout the late summer and fall of 1945, and was released in November of that year. The total period of preproduction through postproduction at PRC ran from March through November 1945.\n\nIn contrast, during the period ''Detour'' was in [[post-production]], PRC shot, posted, and released ''[[Apology for Murder]]'' (1945), also starring Savage. ''Apology'' was given a shorter production period and a quick [[Sound design|sound job]], and used library music for the soundtrack. Clearly, ''Detour'' was a higher priority to PRC, and the release was well promoted in theaters with a full array of color print support, including six-sheet posters, [[standee]]s, hand drawn portraits of the actors, and a jukebox tie-in record with [[Bing Crosby]] singing \"[[I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me]]\" (1926).<ref name=\"morton\"/>\n\nWith reshoots out of the question for such a low-budget movie, director Ulmer put storytelling above continuity. For example, he flipped the negative for some of the hitchhiking scenes. This showed the westbound New York City to Los Angeles travel of the character with a right-to-left flow across the screen, though it also made cars seem to be driving on the \"wrong\" side of the road, with the hitchhiker getting into the car on the driver's side.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037638/trivia|title=Detour (1945) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n===Charlie Haskell's car===\n\n[[File:Car used in 1945 film Detour.jpeg|thumb|right|The 1941 [[Lincoln Continental]] driven by Haskell and Roberts]]\n\nThe car owned by the character Charlie Haskell and later driven by Al Roberts is itself an integral part of the film's plot and is certainly the most memorable prop item in the production. The automobile is a customized 1941 [[Lincoln Continental]] V-12 convertible, a base model of a \"Cabriolet\" but one that features bolted-on rear wheel-well covers and some exterior components added later from Lincoln's limited 1942 version of the same model.<ref name=\"IMCDb\">Potter, Andr\u00e9.

Contemporary screenings of ''Detour'' were also not confined to [[grindhouse]] theaters; they were presented at top \"movie houses\". For example, in downtown Los Angeles in May 1946, it played at the 2,200-seat [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum]] in combination with a live stage show featuring the hit [[Slim Gaillard]] Trio and the [[Buddy Rich]] Orchestra. Business was reported to be excellent despite a transit strike.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT53 |newspaper=The Billboard|title=Orpheum, Los Angeles (Tuesday afternoon, May 14)|date= May 25, 1946|pages= 54, 56}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the film's release in November 1945, Mandel Herbstman, the reviewer for the trade journal ''Motion Picture Herald'', rated the production as only \"fair\". Herbstman was impressed, however, with the film's overall structure. \"Venturing far from the familiar melodramatic pattern\", he wrote, \"director Edgar G. Ulmer has turned out an adroit, albeit unpretentious production about a man who stumbles into a series of circumstances which seals his doom.\"<ref name=\"MPH45\">{{Cite news|last=Herbstman|first=Mandel|date=November\u2013December 1945|title=Production Digest|work=Motion Picture Herald|url=https://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/motionpictureher161unse_0193|access-date=18 October 2020}}</ref> He especially liked its conclusion and noted, \"Making no compromise with the 'happy ending' formula, the film has a number of ironic and suspenseful moments.\"<ref name=\"MPH45\"/>\n\nThe film was released to television in the early 1950s, and it was broadcast in syndicated TV markets until the advent of mass cable systems. TV reviewers casually recommended it in the 1960s and 1970s as a worthwhile \"B\" movie. Then, by the 1980s, critics began citing ''Detour'' increasingly as a prime example of ''film noir'', and revival houses, universities and film festivals began presenting the crime drama in tributes to Edgar G. Ulmer and his work. The director died in 1972, unfortunately before the full revival of ''Detour'' and the critical re-evaluation of his career occurred. Tom Neal died the same year as Ulmer, but Ann Savage lived long enough to experience the newfound acclaim. From 1985 until just two years before her death in 2008, she made a series of live appearances at public screenings of the film.\n\n===More recent assessments of film===\nCritical response to the film decades after its release is almost universally positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000001145268/detour.html|title=Critics' Picks: 'Detour'|first=Gabe|last=Johnson|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> More current reviewers contrast the technical shoddiness of the film with its successful atmospherics as film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his essay for ''The Great Movies'', \"This movie from Hollywood's [[Poverty Row|poverty row]], shot in six days, filled with technical errors and ham-handed narrative, starring a man who can only pout and a woman who can only sneer, should have faded from sight soon after it was released in 1945.
