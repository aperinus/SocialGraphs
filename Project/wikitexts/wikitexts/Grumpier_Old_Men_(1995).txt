It stars [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Burgess Meredith]] (in his final film role), [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Kevin Pollak]], [[Katie Sagona]] and [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]]. ''Grumpier Old Men'' was directed by [[Howard Deutch]], with the screenplay written by [[Mark Steven Johnson]] and the original music score composed by [[Alan Silvestri]]. Meredith developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and had to be coached through his role in the film. He died in 1997.\n\n==Plot== \nThe feud between Max and John has cooled and they have become good friends. Their children, Melanie and Jacob have become engaged. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to new wife Ariel. John and Max still call each other \"moron\" and \"putz\" respectively, but with friendly intentions.\n\nThe spring and summer fishing season is in full swing with the annual quest to catch \"Catfish Hunter,\" an unusually large [[catfish]] that seems to enjoy eluding anyone that tries to catch it. However, the local bait shop closed after Chuck, the previous owner, died in the first movie. Maria Ragetti has purchased the property with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant.\n\nIrritated it will no longer be a bait shop, Max and John join forces to sabotage the restaurant. They are successful at first with their [[practical jokes]]. However, when Ariel learns what is going on, she tells John to apologize to Maria at once, and he does after Ariel kicks him out of the house. Max and Maria begin dating after discovering a shared passion for fishing, while her mother Francesca dates John's father, J.W.\n\nTo complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie call off their engagement due to stress from their parents' involvement. Upon hearing the news, John and Max reignite their feud and go back to their childish pranks again such as John cutting a hole in Max's fishing net and detaching the anchor to his boat. Max retaliates by disconnecting John's motor from his boat and broadcasting him nude (while Ariel was making a clay statue of him) at a Sears department store. Ariel is stressed out because of it and leaves John until things settle down. At the restaurant, Francesca is worried about all the time Maria spends with Max. She reminds her daughter of her five failed marriages and worries that Max will make it six.\n\nAfter being convinced to take a long look at herself, Maria reluctantly stops seeing Max. Distraught over losing Ariel, John heads to the lake for his father's advice but finds that he has died in his favorite spot with a fishing pole in one hand and a can of beer in the other. Following the funeral and the spreading of J.W.'s ashes in the lake, John and Max call off their feud again.\n\nAfter realizing that their own inability to properly plan a wedding is what drove their kids to call it off, they decide to set it right. They help Jacob and Melanie reconcile, explaining their drama. John decides to reconcile with Ariel and convinces Max to talk to Maria. He does and convinces her to take a chance on him, while convincing her mother that he's not going to be like her previous sons-in-laws. John and Max manage to catch \"Catfish Hunter\" but they reluctantly decide to release it so it can be with J.W. in the lake. After they let it go, they realize that they're late for a wedding happening in town and rush to the church as quickly as they can. The wedding is revealed to be for Max and Maria, who have reconciled (Jacob and Melanie have eloped). On the way to their honeymoon, they discover Max's one-eyed bulldog, Lucky, in the car with them, being put there by John earlier as a prank. Ragetti's is also reformed so it will be both a restaurant and a bait shop.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as John Gustafson Jr.\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Max Goldman\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti Goldman\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Ariel Truax Gustafson\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as \"Grandpa\" John Gustafson Sr.\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Melanie Gustafson Goldman\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Jacob Goldman\n* [[Katie Sagona]] as Allie (Melanie's daughter)\n* [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]] as Francesca \"Mama\" Ragetti\n* [[Max Wright]] as County Health Inspector\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''Grumpier Old Men'' grossed $71 million at the North American box office, against a production budget of $25 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weekend Box Office: 'Exhale' Blows Down the Competition |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-27/entertainment/ca-18149_1_weekend-gross |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weekend Box Office: Rosy News for Hollywood, 'Monkeys' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-09/entertainment/ca-22520_1_weekend-box |access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref> ''Grumpier Old Men'' beat its predecessor's total of $70 million and cost $10 million less to make than the original.
