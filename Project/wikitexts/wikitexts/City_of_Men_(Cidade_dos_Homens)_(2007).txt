The screenplay was written by Elena Soarez based on a story by Morelli and Soarez. It is a film version of the TV series ''[[Cidade dos Homens]]'' that ran for four seasons in Brazil, following the international success of the film ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002), both co-directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]] who also co-produces this film.\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Acerola (\"Ace\") and Laranjinha (\"Wallace\") live in the ''[[favela]]s'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]], and have been raised without their fathers. They are turning eighteen as a war between rival drug gangs begins around them. Wallace, with Ace's help, gets to meet his father, Heraldo, in person, a parolee living not very far away, only to witness the police arrest of his father a few days after. Wallace and Ace discover that their fathers were best friends, but Heraldo killed Ace's father in a robbery incident. Each discovers things about his missing father that could potentially compromise their solid friendship. At the end, they decide to leave \"the Hill\" and lead a responsible life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Douglas Silva]] as Acerola, \"Ace\"\n* [[Darlan Cunha]] as Laranjinha, or \"Wallace\"\n* [[Jonathan Haagensen]] as Madrugad\u00e3o\n* Rodrigo dos Santos as Heraldo\n* Camila Monteiro as Cris\n* Naima Silva as Camila\n* Eduardo Piranha as Nefasto\n* Luciano Vidigal as Fiel\n* Pedro Henrique as Caju\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''City of Men'' currently has an approval rating of 74% and an average score of 6.7 out of 10, based on 82 critic reviews.
