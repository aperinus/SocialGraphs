Directed by [[Carol Reed]] from a screenplay by [[Vernon Harris]], the picture includes such musical numbers as \"[[Food, Glorious Food]]\", \"[[Consider Yourself]]\", \"[[As Long as He Needs Me]]\", \"[[You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two]]\", and \"[[Where Is Love?]]\". It stars [[Ron Moody]], [[Oliver Reed]], [[Harry Secombe]], [[Shani Wallis]], [[Jack Wild]], and [[Mark Lester]] in the [[Oliver Twist (character)|title role]]. Filmed at [[Shepperton Studios|Shepperton Film Studio]] in [[Surrey]], it was a [[Romulus films|Romulus]] production by John Woolf and was distributed internationally by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nAt the [[41st Academy Awards]] for 1968, ''Oliver!'' was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]] and won six, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Reed, and an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Award]] for choreographer [[Onna White]]. At the [[26th Golden Globe Awards]], the film won two [[Golden Globes]]: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Ron Moody.\n\nThe [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''Oliver!'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|77th greatest British film of the 20th century]]. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine ranked it the 69th best British film ever.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 \"The 100 best British films\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/2019.04.03-073405/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films%23tab_panel_4#tab_panel_4 |date=3 April 2019 }}. ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''. Retrieved 26 October 2017</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nAt a workhouse in [[Dunstable]], the governors hold a sumptuous banquet while the orphans are served their daily [[gruel]] and dream of enjoying (\"Food, Glorious Food\"). Forced by some of the other boys, who draw lots, where the tangled one falls on Oliver, Oliver approaches [[Mr. Bumble]] and the Widow Corney, and asks for more to eat. Enraged, Bumble takes Oliver to the governors for punishment (\"Oliver!\"). Paraded in the street to be sold to the highest bidder (\"Boy for Sale\"), Oliver is purchased by an undertaker. When his apprentice, Noah Claypole insults Oliver's dead mother, Oliver attacks him and is thrown by the undertakers into a coffin, until Mr. Bumble arrives to explain to them that Oliver should have been fed gruel instead of meat. Mr. Bumble grabs Oliver out of the casket and throws him into the cellar. Alone in the dark, surrounded by empty coffins, Oliver wonders (\"Where Is Love?\") before escaping through a window grate.\n\nAfter a week on the road, Oliver reaches London. He meets the [[Artful Dodger]], who takes him under his wing (\"Consider Yourself\"). Dodger brings Oliver to a hideout for young pickpockets led by [[Fagin]], who instructs the gang in the art of stealing, declaring that (\"You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two\") to get by. Fagin later meets with [[Bill Sikes]], a burglar. Sikes's girlfriend, [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]], ponders her life (\"It's a Fine Life\"). When Fagin returns to his den, he opens up a secret wall where the box of valuables are kept, talking to an owl, until Oliver wakes up, startling Fagin, who explains to Oliver that his treasures were for his old age, before tucking him back in and singing him to sleep(\"You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two\" reprise).\n\nIn the morning, Nancy and her friend Bet arrive at the hideout to collect Sikes' money. The boys mock Oliver for his manners, which Nancy finds charming. Dodger attempts to be just as gentlemanly (\"I'd Do Anything\"). Fagin sends the boys out for the day, entrusting Oliver to Dodger (\"Be Back Soon\"). Dodger steals a wallet from [[Mr. Brownlow]], but Oliver is apprehended instead. Fearing Oliver will lead the police to the gang, Fagin and Sikes send Nancy to court. Oliver is too terrified to speak, but before the verdict is finalized, a witness named Mr. Jessop, the owner of the bookstall where Brownlow had been shopping just before the robbery, arrives and proclaims Oliver's innocence. Brownlow takes Oliver in, while Sikes and Fagin send Dodger to follow them, to Nancy's displeasure.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nOliver wakes up in Mr. Brownlow's house, and happily watches from his balcony the merchants and inhabitants of [[Bloomsbury Square]] singing about this particular morning being so beautiful (\"Who Will Buy\"). Meanwhile, Fagin and Sikes decide to abduct Oliver and bring him back to the den with Nancy's help. Nancy, who has come to care for Oliver, at first refuses to help, but Sikes physically abuses her, forcing her into obedience. In spite of this, Nancy still loves Sikes, and believes he loves her too (\"As Long as He Needs Me\").\n\nThe next morning at Mr. Brownlow's house in Bloomsbury, Mr. Brownlow sends Oliver to return some books, with a five-pound note, to the booksellers. Before he departs, Oliver notices a portrait painting of a beautiful young girl. Mr Brownlow notes Oliver's resemblance to the girl - his niece Emily who disappeared years ago. He begins to suspect he may be Oliver's great-uncle.\n\nAs Oliver stops to enjoy a puppet show with other children, Nancy and Sikes appear and grab Oliver. They bring him back to Fagin's den, where Sikes quarrels and demands the five pound note from Fagin, for all of the trouble Sikes went through to kidnap Oliver, while Fagin keeps the books. After Oliver slaps Sikes, Sikes is about to hit him with a belt, until Nancy saves Oliver from a beating from Sikes after the boy tries to flee. Nancy remorsefully reviews their life, but Bill maintains that any living is better than none. Fagin tries to act as an intermediary, suggesting to Sikes to calmly sit and talk things out; however, Sikes takes Fagin by the scruff of his neck, warning him that if anyone led the authorities to their hideout, Sikes would kill Fagin. At this instant, Fagin declares Sikes to be a violent man. Left alone, Fagin wonders what his life might be like if he became an honest man (\"Reviewing the Situation\"); however, after thinking of various excuses, he elects to remain a thief.\n\nBumble and Corney pay a visit to Mr. Brownlow after he begins searching for Oliver's origin. They present a locket belonging to Oliver's mother, who arrived at the workhouse penniless and died during childbirth. Mr. Brownlow recognizes the locket as his niece's and throws the two out, enraged that they selfishly chose to keep the trinket and information to themselves until they could collect a reward for it. Meanwhile, in an attempt to introduce Oliver to a life of crime, Sikes forces Oliver to take part in a house robbery. The robbery fails when Oliver accidentally awakens the occupants, but he and Sikes get away. While Sikes and Oliver are gone, Nancy, fearful for Oliver's life, goes to Mr. Brownlow, confessing her part in Oliver's kidnapping; however, she refuses to state the name of Fagin or Sikes. She promises to return him to Mr. Brownlow at midnight at London Bridge; then she goes to the tavern. When Sikes and Oliver appear, Sikes orders his dog Bullseye to guard the boy. Nancy starts up a lively drinking song (\"Oom-Pah-Pah\"), hoping that the noise will distract Sikes. Bullseye, however, alerts Sikes, who gives chase.\n\nAs Oliver and Nancy share a farewell embrace at London Bridge, Sikes catches up and grabs both of them and throws Nancy aside before trying to take off with Oliver. When Nancy tries to stop Sikes by attacking him, it angers him. He then drags her behind the staircase of London Bridge and violently bludgeons her, injuring her fatally. He then takes off with Oliver, but Bullseye returns to the scene where Nancy has succumbed to her injuries and alerts the police. The dog leads Mr. Brownlow and an angry mob to the thieves' hideout. Sikes arrives at Fagin's den and demands money, revealing that he killed Nancy as well. Upon seeing the approaching mob, the thieves disband and flee. Sikes runs off with Oliver, using him as a hostage. During the evacuation, Fagin loses his prized possessions, which sink into mud. Sikes attempts to flee to an adjacent roof, but is shot dead in the process by the police. Fagin makes up his mind to change his ways for good. Just as he is about to walk away a reformed character, Dodger steps out from behind a post box with a lined wallet he stole earlier. The two of them then dance off into the sunrise together, happily determined to live out the rest of their days as thieves (\"Reviewing the situation reprise\") while Oliver returns to Mr. Brownlow's home for good.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mark Lester]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]\n*[[Ron Moody]] as [[Fagin]]\n* [[Jack Wild]] as [[Artful Dodger]]\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Bill Sikes]]\n* [[Shani Wallis]] as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]\n* [[Harry Secombe]] as [[Mr. Bumble]]\n* [[Joseph O'Conor]] as [[Mr. Brownlow]]\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as the Magistrate\n* [[Peggy Mount]] as Corney\n*[[Leonard Rossiter]] as Mr. Sowerberry\n*[[Hylda Baker]] as Mrs. Sowerberry\n*[[Kenneth Cranham]] as Noah Claypole \n* [[Megs Jenkins]] as Mrs. Bedwin\n*[[Sheila White (actress)|Sheila White]] as Bett\n*[[Wensley Pithey]] as Dr. Grimwig\n*[[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]] as Mr. Jessop\n*[[Elizabeth Knight]] as Charlotte\n*[[Fred Emney]] as Chairman of the Workhouse\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe film used mostly young unknowns, among them [[Mark Lester]] ([[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]), [[Shani Wallis]] ([[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]) and [[Jack Wild]] as [[The Artful Dodger]], but also featured [[Hugh Griffith]], an Oscar winner for ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', in the role of the Magistrate. [[Harry Secombe]], who played Mr. Bumble, was well known in Britain but not in the United States, and [[Oliver Reed]], who played Bill Sikes, had just begun to make a name for himself. Producer [[John Woolf (producer)|John Woolf]] suggested Oliver Reed for the role to the director Carol Reed, without knowing that the two were, in fact, related as nephew and uncle respectively. Many felt that the role of Nancy should have gone to [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]], who had played the role in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production.<ref>{{cite book|title=High Fidelity/Musical America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poo9AQAAIAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Billboard Pub|page=134|access-date=17 February 2020|archive-date=15 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215192348/https://books.google.com/books?id=poo9AQAAIAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Classical actor [[Joseph O'Conor]], not well known in the U.S., played Mr. Brownlow.\n\nFilming at [[Shepperton Studios]] commenced on 23 June 1967.<ref>[http://www.oliver1968.co.uk/Stage_Screen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024004218/http://www.oliver1968.co.uk/stage_screen.htm|date=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Oliver!

Jack Wild (Dodger in film Oliver) tijdens persconferentie in bioscoop D, Bestanddeelnr 921-8847 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|The performance of Jack Wild received critical acclaim and earned the 16-year-old actor his only nominations for a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor|Golden Globe Award]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]], as well as nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], making him the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 4|fourth-youngest]] nominee in the category.]]\n''Oliver!'' received widespread acclaim from critics. It was hailed by [[Pauline Kael]] in her review published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as being one of the few film versions of a stage musical that was superior to the original show, which she suggested she had walked out on. \"The musical numbers emerge from the story with a grace that has been rarely seen since the musicals of [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]].\"<ref>Pauline Kael ''Going Steady'', p.202</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film four out of four stars. \"Sir Carol Reed's ''Oliver!'' is a treasure of a movie,\" he wrote. \"It is very nearly universal entertainment, one of those rare films like ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' that appeals in many ways to all sorts of people. It will be immediately exciting to the children, I think, because of the story and the unforgettable Dickens characters. Adults will like it for the sweep and zest of its production. And as a work of popular art, it will stand the test of time, I guess. It is as well-made as a film can be.\" He particularly admired Carol Reed's working relationship with the children in the film: \"Not for a moment, I suspect, did Reed imagine he had to talk down to the children in his audience. Not for a moment are the children in the cast treated as children. They're equal participants in the great adventure, and they have to fend for themselves or bloody well get out of the way. This isn't a watered-down lollypop. It's got bite and malice along with...romance and humor.\" Although he stated that the film's [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow presentation]] was a minor problem for children, who are not used to long films, he praised the production design, musical adaptation score, and casting and acting, particularly that of [[Ron Moody]] and [[Jack Wild]]. He concluded, \"''Oliver!'' succeeds finally because of its taste. It never stoops for cheap effects and never insults our intelligence. And because we can trust it, we can let ourselves go with it, and we do. It is a splendid experience.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/oliver-1968|title=Oliver!

It has catchy, sometimes beautiful songs and the voices to go with them.
