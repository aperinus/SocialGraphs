It was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]]'s Morningside Productions for [[Columbia Pictures]]. The screenplay was written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. As with several other Schneer-Columbia collaborations, the film was developed to showcase the [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] of [[Ray Harryhausen]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe first U.S. spaceship to [[Venus]], the XY-21, crashes into the Mediterranean sea off the coast of [[Sicily]], Italy. Fishermen board boats and head to the spacecraft, enter through a hole in the spacecraft, and pull two spacemen from the nose-down craft before it completely sinks.\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], Major General A.D. McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds and opens a translucent cylinder marked \u201cUSAF\u201d on the beach. It contains a gelatinous mass, which he presents to Dr. Leonardo, a zoologist studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, in the last throes of the fatal disease that killed his other eight crewmen.\n\nAfter Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the egg, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus. Leonardo and Marisa hitch the trailer to their truck and head for [[Rome]]. Calder's spacecraft carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn [[Venusians|Venusian]] species. As police divers begin to search for it, McIntosh offers a half-million lira reward for the capsule's recovery, prompting Pepe to lead them to the empty container. When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him.\n\nThat night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats sulfur and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer's dog, and the creature maims the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed.\n\nAfter the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in an electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature's food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens.\n[[File:20 million miles to earth (1957) Ymir 2.png|thumb|The fully grown ymir from ''20 Million Miles to Earth''.]]\nThe creature, now in gargantuan size, battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature maims the elephant and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the River Tiber, where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, destroying the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]]. It heads for the Colosseum and destroys an ancient temple, killing a few soldiers. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit. Direct fire from a tank then destroys the ledge the creature is clinging to, and it plunges to its death. A relieved Marisa runs into Calder's arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[William Hopper]] as Robert Calder\n* [[Joan Taylor]] as Marisa Leonardo\n* [[Frank Puglia]] as Dr. Leonardo\n* [[John Zaremba]] as Dr. Judson Uhl\n* [[Thomas Browne Henry|Thomas B.

All references to the name [[Ymir]] were removed from the released version of the film, as Harryhausen was concerned that audiences might confuse it with the [[Arabic]] title \"[[Emir]]\".  Most of the noises made by Ymir are recordings of elephant noises played at a higher speed.\n\nRay Harryhausen wanted the film to be shot in color, but the filmmakers were not given a budget large enough to accommodate color filming. In 2007, five years after the death of the film's director, Harryhausen worked with restoration and [[film colorization|colorization]] company [[Legend Films]] to create a colorized version of the film. That version, along with the original theatrical black-and-white version, was released on July 31, 2007 on DVD as part of a 50th Anniversary Edition of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=4496 |title=Special 50th Anniversary DVD of Harryhausen Classic '20 Million Miles to Earth' restored for special 2-disc colorized edition |last=Thomas |first=Brian|date=May 23, 2007 |publisher=iF magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225100/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=4496 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/6892 |title=20 Million Miles Gets Color on Disc |last=Ball |first=Ryan|date=May 23, 2007 |magazine=Animation Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThere are minor differences between the two versions. One example: the black-and-white version begins in \"A Fishing Village in [[Sicily]]\" (the fictional Gerra), not [[Sperlonga]], Italy.\n\nIt was the first of three collaborations between Harryhausen, Schneer, and Nathan Juran. Juran only directed the American sequences, while Schneer and Harryhausen directed the Italian sequences.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-141/141#page/n60/mode/1up|last=Swires|first=Steve|title=Nathan Juran: The Fantasy Voyages of Jerry the Giant Killer Part One|magazine=Starlog Magazine|issue=141|date= April 1989|pages=61}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''20 Million Miles to Earth'' has an 80% positive rating at the film [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on ten reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/20_million_miles_to_earth/ |title=20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> Marco Lanzagorta of ''[[PopMatters]]'' gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, calling it \"required viewing for those interested in modern cinema\".<ref>{{cite news | title =20 Million Miles to Earth| work =[[PopMatters]] | first = Marco | last = Lanzagorta | date = August 15, 2007 | url = http://www.popmatters.com/review/20-million-miles-to-earth1/ | access-date = 2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' wrote, \"Don't worry about the dotty script or cardboard performances - just sit back and watch this gelatinous blob in action\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/20-million-miles-to-earth|title=20 Million Miles to Earth}}</ref> while the ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it \"one of animation master Ray Harryhausen's best [[fantasy film]]s, and his own personal favourite.
