It was an [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]]-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany, and the United States.

The plot revolves around three [[gunslinger]]s competing to find a fortune in a buried cache of [[Confederate gold]] amid the violent chaos of the [[American Civil War]] (specifically the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]] of the [[New Mexico Campaign]] in 1862) while participating in many battles, confrontations, and duels along the way.<ref name=\"Yezbick\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Yezbick |first=Daniel |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |encyclopedia=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |access-date=23 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154144/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref> The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.\n\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was marketed as the third and final installment in the [[Dollars Trilogy]], following ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], a mercenary known as \"Angel Eyes\" interrogates former [[Army of New Mexico|Confederate]] soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of [[Confederate gold]]. Learning Jackson's new alias \"Bill Carson\", Angel Eyes kills Stevens and then his employer Baker so he can find the gold himself. Bandit Tuco Ramirez is rescued from bounty hunters by a nameless drifter who is called \"[[Man with No Name|Blondie]]\" by Tuco. Blondie delivers Tuco to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it and setting him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty. They repeat the process in other towns until Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and strands him in the desert.\n\nBent on revenge, and after one failed attempt with his gang, Tuco finally catches up with Blondie and force-marches him across the [[desert]] until Blondie collapses from [[dehydration]]. A runaway horse-drawn hospital ambulance arrives with several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in [[Sad Hill Cemetery]],<!-- Please do not change this to Sand Hill. The subtitles and closed captions both are written Sad. See the talk page for further discussion --> in exchange for help. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie slumped next to him, revealing that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco poses as a Confederate soldier and takes Blondie to a nearby [[Catholic missions|frontier mission]] to recover. At the mission, Tuco reunites with his brother, Pablo, who left his family when Tuco was young to become a priest. Their meeting does not go well; they become hostile and engage in a physical confrontation. Tuco and Blondie subsequently leave the monastery.\n\nThe duo decides to search for the gold together. Tuco yells Confederate-supportive statements to a group of soldiers but they turn out to be members of a Union patrol, the blue color of their uniforms having been obscured by dust. Blondie and Tuco are taken to a prison camp that Angel Eyes has infiltrated as a Union sergeant in his search for Bill Carson. Tuco poses as Carson and is taken away for questioning. He reveals the name of the cemetery under torture and is sent away to be hanged. Knowing Blondie would not reveal the name on the grave, Angel Eyes recruits him into his search. Tuco escapes his fate by killing Angel Eyes' henchman and soon finds himself in an evacuated town, where Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his gang have also arrived.\n\nBlondie finds Tuco and the pair kill Angel Eyes' men, though Angel Eyes escapes. They travel toward Sad Hill before ending up on the Union side of a military siege over a strategic bridge. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with [[explosive]]s, Tuco suggests they share information. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave. After the bridge is demolished the armies disperse. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. Tuco finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging, where Blondie encourages him at gunpoint to continue. Angel Eyes arrives and holds Blondie at gunpoint. Blondie states that he lied about the name on Stanton's grave and appears to write the real name of the grave on a rock before challenging Tuco and Angel Eyes to a [[Truel|three-way duel]].\n\n[[File:Mexican standoff.jpg|thumb|The iconic [[Mexican standoff]], with Tuco seen on the left, Angel Eyes in the middle, and Blondie on the right: The scene is accompanied by [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"The Trio\".]]\nThe trio stares each other down. Everyone eventually draws with Blondie killing Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco is initially elated to find bags of gold, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint and orders him into a [[hangman's noose]] beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him to stand balanced precariously atop an unsteady grave marker while he takes his half of the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. He severs the rope with a rifle shot, leaving Tuco alive to furiously curse him while he disappears over the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===The trio===\n*[[Clint Eastwood]] as 'Blondie' (the [[Man with No Name]]): The Good, a taciturn, confident [[bounty hunter]], teams up with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. Despite this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the war is evident. \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly,\" he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point, neither ''A Fistful of Dollars'' nor ''For a Few Dollars More'' had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had, but Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife traveled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000<ref name=\"Hughes12\">Hughes, p.12</ref> and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets\u2014a deal with which Leone was not happy.<ref>[[Sergio Leone]], C'era una volta il Cinema. [[Radio 24 (Italy)|Radio 24]].

This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. --> The director originally considered [[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] (who portrayed the villains in both the preceding films) for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with \"natural comic talent\". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), in particular, his performance in \"The Railroads\" scene.<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 221</ref> In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was skeptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from ''For a Few Dollars More'', Wallach said: \"When do you want me?\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 223.</ref> The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, \"Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint and Lee's characters remain mysteries.\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 224</ref> In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad.<ref name=\"Hughes15\">Hughes, p.15</ref> This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to \"The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]\".\n*[[Lee Van Cleef]] as 'Angel Eyes': The Bad, a ruthless, confident, borderline-sadistic mercenary, takes pleasure in killing and always finishes a job for which he is paid, usually tracking and assassination. <!-- When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. --> Originally, Leone wanted [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the ''Dollars Trilogy'' films)<ref>Cox, p. 108</ref> or [[Charles Bronson]] to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: \"I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in ''For a Few Dollars More''. The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me.\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 220</ref> In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named \"Banjo\", but is referred to as \"Sentenza\" (meaning \"Sentence\" or \"Judgement\") in the Italian version.

Producer Alberto Grimaldi, Sergio Leone and he had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about \"a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War\".<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 209</ref> The studio agreed but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 upfront and 50% of the box-office takings outside of Italy. The total budget was eventually $1.2&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nLeone built upon the screenwriter's original concept to \"show the absurdity of war&nbsp;... the Civil War, which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 204</ref> An avid history buff, Leone said, \"I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as [[Andersonville prison|Andersonville]]. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 205</ref> The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by [[Mathew Brady]] and Alexander Gardner.<ref>Hanley (2016), e.g. Figure 1.15 on p. 21, Behind-the-scenes of Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, {{ISBN|978-3-00-040476-4}}</ref> As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.<ref name=\"Munn59\">Munn, p. 59</ref>\n\nWhile Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, \"I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life.\"<ref name=\"Frayling215\">Frayling (2000), p. 215</ref> Donati agreed, saying, \"There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line.\"<ref name=\"Frayling215\"/> Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in eleven days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, \"[''Sentenza''] has no spirit, he's a professional in the banalest sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer ''il Biondo'' (Blondie), but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the ''Tuco'' side&nbsp;... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity.\"<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 217</ref> [[Film director]] [[Alex Cox]] suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumors surrounding the [[anti-Communist]] [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.<ref>Cox, p. 93</ref>\n\nEastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike in the first two films, from which he received a straight fee. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another ''Dollars'' film, he joked, \"the only reason they brought me back was that they forgot to kill me off in ''For a Few Dollars More''\".<ref name=\"Munn59\" />\n\nThe film's working title was ''I due magnifici straccioni'' (''The Two Magnificent Tramps''). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo'' (''The Good, the Ugly, the Bad''), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, ''River of Dollars'', or ''The Man With No Name'', but decided on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''.<ref name=\"Hughes15\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Almeria 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Set of ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' with the distinctive rugged terrain in the background]]\n[[File:Cementerio Sad Hill 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sad Hill Cemetery]] as it was in 2016]]\nProduction began at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\" /> The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near [[province of Burgos|Burgos]] in the north, which doubled for the Southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in [[province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]] in the south of Spain.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\">Patrick McGillagan (1999).

Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final [[Mexican stand-off]] scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like \"the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs\", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close-ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\" /> Filming concluded in July 1966.<ref name=\"Hughes12\" />\n\nEastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. \"In the first film, I was alone,\" he told Leone. \"In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.\"<ref name=\"McGillagan152\">McGillagan (1999), p.152</ref> As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accept the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another [[Ferrari]]<ref name=\"Eliot250Ferar\">Eliot (2009), p. 81</ref> and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), he was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the [[William Morris Agency]] and [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\">McGillagan (1999), p.153</ref> Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor [[Franco Nero]], who was filming ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' at the time.<ref name=\"Nero\">{{Cite AV media |title=Texas, Adios (Franco Nero: Back In The Saddle) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=1966}}</ref>\n\nWallach and Eastwood flew to [[Madrid]] together, and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\">McGillagan (1999), p.155</ref> Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography<ref>[[Eli Wallach|Wallach, Eli]] (2005). ''The Good, the Bad and Me: In My Anecdotage'', p. 255</ref> and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes.<ref>Frayling (2000), pp. 169\u2013170</ref> For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back.<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 226</ref> The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where Mario Brega and he\u2014who are chained together\u2014jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.<ref>Frayling (2000), p. 225</ref>\n\nThe bridge in the film was constructed twice by [[sapper]]s of the Spanish army and rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. On the first occasion, an Italian camera operator signaled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning \"start\". Nobody was injured in the resulting explosion. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy functional structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it.<ref>Frayling (2000), pp. 210\u2013211</ref> Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nAs an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach spoke English and were dubbed into Italian for their debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.121</ref> The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with [[synchronized sound]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review |title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Blu-ray Review |website=[[IGN]] |author=Shaffer, R.L.|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403152156/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=live}} 28 May 2009</ref> Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone's music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, recording the sound cleanly would have been difficult in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in postproduction.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.122</ref>\n\nBy the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone insisted, often forcefully, on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which often exhausted the actors.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> Leone, who was obese, prompted amusement through his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him \"[[Yosemite Sam]]\" for his bad temper.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role of Harmonica in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson.<ref name=\"McGillagan158\">McGillagan (1999), p. 158</ref> Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of ''Once Upon a Time in America'' when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of [[Robert De Niro]], saying, \"Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same\u2014a block of marble. Bobby, first of all, is an actor, and Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers and Clint yawns.\"<ref name=\"McGillagan159\">McGillagan (1999), p. 159</ref> Eastwood later gave a friend the [[Poncho#Film|poncho]] he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in [[Carmel, California]].<ref>Munn, p. 63</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nIn its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature [[Long shot|long drawn]] and [[close-up]] style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching for a holstered gun.<ref name=\"Culture\">{{cite web |url=http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time |title=50 Reasons Why The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Might Just Be The Greatest Film of all Time |publisher=What Culture |author=Leigh, Stephen |date=28 November 2011 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601075045/http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time | archive-date=1 June 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref> This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savor the performances and character reactions, creating a feeling of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful [[landscape]]s.<ref name=\"Culture\" /> Leone also incorporated music to heighten the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nIn filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic [[Mexican standoff]]. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (The Man with No Name), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words.<ref name=\"Drew\" /> All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes, killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed [[trick shooting]], such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a [[hangman's noose]] with a well-placed shot, in many of the film's noted shootouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html |title=On the Big Screen: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Il buono, il bruto, il cattivo, 1966) |publisher=Mondo 70: A Wild World of Cinema |author=Wilson, Samuel|date=2 August 2014 |access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402215653/http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 2 August 2014</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ennio Morricone-The Good, The Bad And The Ugly.ogg\n|title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly main theme\n|description=From The Good, the Bad and the Ugly soundtrack by [[Ennio Morricone]]\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n{{See also|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (soundtrack)}}\nThe score is composed by frequent Leone collaborator [[Ennio Morricone]].

He has noted the film's theme of [[Aestheticization of violence|emphasis on violence]] and the deconstruction of [[Old West]] [[romanticism]]. The emphasis on violence is seen in how the three leads (Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco) are introduced to various acts of violence. With Blondie, it is seen in his attempt to free Tuco which results in a gun battle. Angel Eyes is set up in a scene in which he carries out a hit on a former Confederate soldier called Stevens. After getting the information he needs from Stevens he is given money to kill Baker (his employer). He then proceeds to kill Stevens and his son. Upon returning to Baker he kills him too (fulfilling his title as 'The Bad'). Tuco is set up in a scene in which three bounty hunters try to kill him. In the film's opening scene three bounty hunters enter a building in which Tuco is hiding. After the sound of gunfire is heard Tuco escapes through a window. We then get a shot of the three corpses (fulfilling his title as 'The Ugly'). They are all after gold and will stop at nothing until they get it.The film deconstructs Old West Romanticism by portraying the characters as antiheroes. Even the character considered by the film as 'The Good' can still be considered as not living up to that title in a moral sense. Critic Drew Marton describes it as a \"baroque manipulation\" that criticizes the American Ideology of the Western,<ref name=\"Drew\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php |title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' review |publisher=Pajiba |author=Marton, Drew|date=22 October 2010 |access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120832/http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 22 October 2010</ref> by replacing the heroic [[cowboy]] popularized by [[John Wayne]] with morally complex [[anti-hero|antiheroes]].\n\nNegative themes such as [[cruelty]] and [[greed]] are also given focus and are traits shared by the three leads in the story. Cruelty is shown in the character of Blondie in how he treats Tuco throughout the film. He is seen to sometimes be friendly with him and in other scenes double-cross him and throw him to the side. It is shown in Angel Eyes through his attitudes in the film and his tendency for committing violent acts throughout the film. For example, when he kills Stevens he also kills his son. It is also seen when he is violently torturing Tuco later in the film. It is shown in Tuco how he shows concern for Blondie when he is heavily dehydrated but in truth, he is only keeping him alive to find the gold. It is also shown in his conversation with his brother which reveals that a life of cruelty is all he knows. Richard Aquila writes \"The violent antiheroes of Italian westerns also fit into a folk tradition in southern Italy that honored mafioso and vigilante who used any means to combat corrupt government of church officials who threatened the peasants of the Mezzogiorno\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aquila|first1=Richard|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sagebrush-Trail-Western-Twentieth-Century-American-ebook/dp/B00UHFWI3A|title=The Sagebrush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth Century America|date=2015|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0816531547|location=Tucson, Arizona|page=203|access-date=2 March 2020|archive-date=14 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114150701/https://www.amazon.com/Sagebrush-Trail-Western-Twentieth-Century-American-ebook/dp/B00UHFWI3A|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGreed is shown in the film through its main core plotline of the three characters wanting to find the $200,000 that Bill Carson has said is buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. The main plot concerns their greed as there is a series of double crossings and changing allegiances to get the gold. Russ Hunter writes that the film will \"stress the formation of homosocial relationships as being functional only in the pursuit of wealth\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=Russ |title=The Ecstasy of Gold: Love, Greed, and Homosociality in the Dollars Trilogy |journal=Studies in European Cinema |date=2012 |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=77 |doi=10.1386/seci.9.1.69_1 |s2cid=193197332 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261668091 |access-date=2 March 2020 |archive-date=14 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114150718/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261668091_The_ecstasy_of_gold_Love_greed_and_homosociality_in_the_Dollars_trilogy |url-status=live }}</ref> This all culminates in the film's final set-piece which takes place in the cemetery.

This is seen in the film's rugged and rough aesthetic. The film has an air of dirtiness that can be attributed to the Civil War and in turn, it affects the actions of people, showing how the war deep down has affected the lives of many people. A scene in the extended version presents Angel Eyes arriving in an embattled Confederate outpost. Angel Eyes shows compassion towards the agonizing soldiers, pointing out that even 'The Bad' is shocked by the horrors of the war.\n\nAs Brian Jenkins states \"A union cordial enough to function peacefully could not be reconstructed after a massive blood-letting that left the North crippled by depopulation and debt and the south devastated\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Brian |title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War |date=2014 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal, Canada |isbn=978-0-7735-4409-3 |page=151 |jstor=j.ctt7zt1j2.11 }}</ref> Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to ''[[The Great War (1959 film)|The Great War]]'', a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age & Scarpelli had contributed to).<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" /> An example of this is how Tuco and Blondie blow up a bridge to disperse two sides of the battle.

He notes that [[Pauline Kael]], for example, had appreciated how non-American films of the time \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality\". Along with [[Peter Bondanella]] and others, Frayling argues that such [[Revisionist Western|revisionism]] was the key to Leone's success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole.{{sfn|Frayling|2006|pp=39\u201340, 121\u2013137}} ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', like the later ''[[Once Upon A Time In The West]]'', belongs to multiple Western sub-genres: Epic Western, Outlaw (Gunfighter) Film, Revisionist Western and Spaghetti Western.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-v20333 |last=German |first=Yuri |title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) |work=AllMovie |access-date=1 April 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-v36331 |last=Bozzola |first=Lucia |title=Once Upon A Time In The West (1968) |work=AllMovie |access-date=1 April 2022}}</ref>\n\n''The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'' has been called the definitive Spaghetti Western \u2013 colloquially, these are Westerns produced and directed by Italians, often in collaboration with other European countries, especially Spain and West Germany.

But a handful of westerns were made in Italy before Leone redefined the genre, and the Italians were not the first to make westerns in Europe in the sixties. But it was Leone who defined the look and attitude of the genre with his first western and the two that soon were to follow: ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''. Together these films are called the [[Dollars Trilogy]]. Leone's portrayal of the west, in the latter, wasn't concerned with ideas of the frontier or good vs. evil but rather interested in how the world is unmistakably more complicated than that, and how the western world is one of kill or be killed. These films featured knifings, beatings, shootouts, or other violent action every five to ten minutes. \"The issue of morality belongs to the American western,\" explains Italian director Ferdinando Baldi. \"The violence in our movies is more gratuitous than in American films. There was very little morality because often the protagonist was a bad guy.\" Eastwood's character is a violent and ruthless killer who murders opponents for fun and profit. Behind his cold and stony stare is a cynical mind powered by a dubious morality. Unlike earlier cowboy heroes, Eastwood's character constantly smokes a small cigar and hardly ever shaves. He wears a flat-topped hat and Mexican poncho instead of more traditional western costuming. He never introduces himself when he meets anyone, and nobody ever asks his name. Furthermore, Spaghetti Westerns redefined the western genre to fit the everchanging times of the 1960s and \u201970s. Rather than portraying the traditional mythic West as an exotic and beautiful land of opportunity, hope, and redemption, they depicted a desolate and forsaken West. In these violent and troubled times, Spaghetti Westerns, with their antiheroes, ambiguous morals, brutality, and anti-Establishment themes, resonated with audiences. The film's gratuitous violence, surrealistic style, gloomy look, and eerie sound captured the era's melancholy. It is this new approach to the genre that defined the revisionist western of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s; a movement started by this moral ambiguity of the Spaghetti Westerns, as well as a westerns placement in the context of historical events; both attributes defined and set by ''The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aquila |first1=Richard |title=The Sagebrush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth-Century America |date=2015 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=978-0816531547 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt183gxp6.12.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_SYC-4946%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3A7f0a5f32fa5ff68742caec539c051893 |access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThese films were undeniably stylish. With grandiose wide shots and close-ups that peered into the eyes and souls of the characters, ''The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly'', had the defining cinematographic techniques of the Spaghetti Western. This was Leone's signature technique, using long drawn shots interspersed with extreme close-ups that build tension, as well as develop characters. However, Leone's movies weren't just influenced by style. As Quentin Tarantino notes:\n<blockquote> There was also realism to them: those shitty Mexican towns, the little shacks&nbsp;\u2014 a bit bigger to accommodate the camera&nbsp;\u2014 all the plates they put the beans on, the big wooden spoons. The films were so realistic, which had always seemed to be missing in the westerns of the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, in the brutality and the different shades of grey and black. Leone found an even darker black and off-white. There is realism in Leone's presentation of the Civil War in ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' that was missing from all the Civil War movies that happened before him. Leone's film, and the genre that he defined within it, shows a west that is more violent, less talky, more complex, more theatrical, and just overall more iconic through the use of music, appearing operatic as the music is an illustrative ingredient of the narrative.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frayling |first1=Christopher |title=Shooting Star |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/quentin-tarantino-on-how-spaghetti-westerns-shaped-modern-cinema/ |website=The Spectator |access-date=3 March 2020 |archive-date=14 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114150703/https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/shooting-star |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWith a greater sense of operatic violence than their American cousins, the cycle of spaghetti westerns lasted just a few years, but it has been said to have rewritten the genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Towlson |first1=Jon |title=10 great spaghetti westerns |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-spaghetti-westerns |website=BFI |access-date=3 March 2020 |archive-date=14 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114150706/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-spaghetti-westerns |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Proposed sequel==\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' is the last film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus, does not have an official sequel. However, screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]] stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2'' ''(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)''. According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film's production, including acting as narrator. [[Joe Dante]] and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. The project was ultimately vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.<ref name=sed>Giusti, 2007</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of films considered the best]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Cox |title=10,000 Ways to Die: A Director's Take on the Spaghetti Western |publisher=Oldcastle Books |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84243-304-1}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cumbow |first=Robert |title=The Films of Sergio Leone |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8108-6041-4}}\n*{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=American Rebel: The Life of Clint Eastwood |publisher=[[Harmony Books]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-33688-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanrebellif00elio}}\n*{{cite book |last=Frayling |first=Christopher |title=Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=2000 |isbn=0-571-16438-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/sergioleonesomet00fray/page/222/mode/2up|via=Internet Archive}}\n*{{cite book |last=Frayling |first=Christopher |title=Spaghetti westerns: cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |publisher=I.B.
