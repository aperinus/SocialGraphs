The film is set in [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] and depicts the [[20 July plot]] in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and to use the [[Operation Valkyrie]] national emergency plan to [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|take control]] of the country. The film was released by American studio [[United Artists]] and  stars Cruise as Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], one of the key plotters. The supporting cast includes [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Terence Stamp]], and [[Tom Wilkinson]].\n\nCruise's casting caused controversy among German politicians and members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor's practice of [[Scientology]], which is viewed with [[Scientology in Germany|suspicion in Germany]]. Because of this, the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany, but they were later given access to locations such as Berlin's historic [[Bendlerblock]]. German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its intention to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg's plot.\n\nThe film changed release dates several times, from as early as June 27, 2008, to as late as February 13, 2009. The changing calendar and poor response to United Artists's initial marketing campaign drew criticism about the film's viability, and followed by a positive test screening, ''Valkyrie''{{'}}s release in North America was ultimately changed to December 25, 2008 and was opened in Germany on January 22, 2009; United Artists renewed its marketing campaign to reduce its focus on Cruise and to highlight Singer's credentials. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed nearly $201.5 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Wehrmacht]] Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] is stationed in [[Tunisia]], where he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the future of Germany under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s tyranny. His battalion comes under attack by [[P-40]] fighter-bombers of the [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]], [[Desert Air Force]].<ref>3 Sqn veteran Tom Russell states that: \"operational records and pilot diaries\" for the other Desert Air Force Kittyhawk squadrons \"shows them operating away from Mezzouna...\" at the time. [http://www.3squadron.org.au/subpages/Stauffenberg.htm Tom Russell, 2011, \"3 Squadron and the 'Plot to Kill Hitler'\"] (Access: 23 April 2012.) Russell</ref> Stauffenberg is severely injured in the air raid and is evacuated home to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], where he loses his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Hitler visits his [[Werwolf (Wehrmacht headquarters)|military headquarters]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. General [[Henning von Tresckow]] attempts to [[Operation Spark (1940)|assassinate Hitler]] by smuggling a timebomb disguised as a box of [[Cointreau]] onto his plane. The bomb fails to detonate, and Hitler's plane lands safely in [[Berlin]]. Shortly afterwards, resistance member General [[Hans Oster]] is arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. While recuperating, Stauffenberg is recruited by General [[Friedrich Olbricht]] to take Oster's place in the [[German resistance to Nazism|German Resistance]], which includes Tresckow, General [[Ludwig Beck]], Dr. [[Carl Goerdeler]], and Field Marshal [[Erwin von Witzleben]].\n\nStauffenberg proposes using [[Operation Valkyrie]], which involves the deployment of the [[Replacement Army|Reserve Army]] in a national emergency, as a means to take control of the country. The plotters redraft the plan's orders to dismantle the Nazi regime after assassinating Hitler. Stauffenberg's promotion within the Reserve Army grants him direct access to Hitler, who approves the redrafted plan without fully examining the modifications. Realizing that only General [[Friedrich Fromm]], the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht; but Fromm, although agreeing to remain silent on the matter, declines to be directly involved.\n\nStauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] at the [[Wolfsschanze|Wolf's Lair]]. He persuades General [[Erich Fellgiebel|Fellgiebel]] to cut off communications after the attempt. On July&nbsp;15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at the Wolf's Lair with a bomb, but does not receive permission to proceed as Himmler is absent. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht. Stauffenberg leaves with the bomb and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down. Fromm threatens Olbricht and Stauffenberg that he will arrest them if they try to control the Reserve Army again; Stauffenberg berates the plotters for their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.\n\nOn July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant [[Werner von Haeften|von Haeften]] return to the Wolf's Lair. Due to the warm weather, the conference is being held in an open-window summer barrack, minimizing their bomb's potential effectiveness. Stauffenberg places the briefcase containing the bomb close to Hitler before leaving. Officer [[Heinz Brandt]] moves the case behind a table leg, inadvertently shielding Hitler. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees, managing to bluff his way past security checkpoints and returning to Berlin.\n\nOlbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army without confirmation that Hitler is dead; but Colonel [[Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim|von Quirnheim]], one of the plotters, forges his signature and issues the orders. With Valkyrie underway, the plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a [[coup]], and soldiers begin to take control of the ministries. Rumors surface that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Having learned from Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel|Keitel]] that Hitler is still alive, Fromm refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him.\n\nMajor [[Otto Ernst Remer]] of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but he's stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler. Recognizing the voice on the other end, Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped. Soon, SS officers are released and the plotters are besieged inside the [[Bendlerblock]]. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. Attempting to save himself, Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, during which he places Beck under arrest, and sentences von Quirnheim, Olbricht, von Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death. The ringleaders are executed by [[firing squad]]; Beck is given a pistol and commits [[suicide]]; Tresckow kills himself in a forest by holding a grenade to his throat; Witzleben and Goerdeler are sentenced in [[show trials]] and hanged.\n\nA post-script displays the text of the [[Memorial to the German Resistance|German resistance memorial]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Stauffenberg and Cruise.JPG|thumb|250px|alt=Collage of two photos that each show a man's profile.

With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to supervisor [[Richard R.

In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little was left of the original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in [[Austria]].

Therefore, director Singer had only two members of the firing squad fire, without command, to kill von Haeften but not Stauffenberg. This attempt to explain why Stauffenberg was not killed by the shots that killed von Haeften is speculative but not impossible. Another alteration was to the portrayal of [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]], played in the film by [[Kevin McNally]]. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a \"much more moral character\" in reality.<ref name=\"den of geek\" />\n\nOne significant historical alteration, made to avoid confusion with the audience and also to \"set the stage\" at the Wolf's Lair, was changing the location of the first aborted assassination attempt to kill Hitler on July 11.<ref>Bergstrom Papers, LLC. (2009). \"The Making of Valkyrie\". WWII History, 33-38</ref> Historically, Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden. In the film, this attempt is set inside Hitler's concrete bunker at the Wolf's Lair. Meanwhile, the Berchtesgaden affair is downgraded to a brief scene in which Hitler meets with Stauffenberg to approve a revised plan for Operation Valkyrie (in reality, the Valkyrie updates occurred over a period of several weeks at meetings between Hitler and General Olbricht).<ref>Moorhouse, R., ''Killing Hitler: The Plots, The Assassins, and the Dictator Who Cheated Death'', Bantam (2007)</ref> Producer Christopher McQuarrie later stated that the shift of the first assassination attempt to the Wolf's Lair was in order to show the audience the inside of the concrete command bunker, with the intent being to emphasize that Hitler most certainly would have been killed had the July 20th attempt not been moved to the outdoor conference hut.<ref>\"About Valkyrie\" (Interview by Historynet.com), retrieved November 28, 2008</ref>\n\nBritish novelist [[Justin Cartwright]], who wrote the book ''The Song Before It Is Sung'' about one of the plot's conspirators, wrote, \"The film is true to most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and political vortex into which Germans were being drawn.\" Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, [[Nikolaus Graf von \u00dcxk\u00fcll-Gyllenband]] and his uncle's good friend, [[Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg]], who were both disenchanted with the Nazis and appalled by the atrocities in the concentration camps. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of ''Dichter und Helden'' (\"poets and heroes\"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: \"He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing.\" The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a \"troublesome cop\". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.\n\nThey did not mention or include the popular Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]. He was implicated in the plot and was later forced to kill himself because he knew about the plot but did not warn Hitler. In 2018 it was discovered through previously unknown papers that Rommel did in fact support the plot and even supported killing Hitler, contrary to previous accounts that stated he knew about the plot but did not support it unless Hitler was arrested and tried with due process, not assassination.<ref>{{cite news | last=Cartwright | first=Justin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/10/valkrie-tom-cruise-hitler-plot | title=Secret Germany | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=January 10, 2009 | access-date=January 16, 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Klaper|first1=Elisabeth|title=Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer und Demokrat|url=http://www.murrhardter-zeitung.de/node/1127424|work=Murrhardter Zeitung|date=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Peter Steinbach]] has criticized especially the negative portrayals of some of the conspirators. According to Steinbach the movie depicts Goerdeler in a \"hurtful and irresponsible way\". Also the characterisation of Olbricht is \"downright degrading\", as it downplays Olbricht's important role in the plot. The movie portrays the non-military resistance as \"quarreling, burnt out and powerless\". Actually the military conspirators were not aiming at a military coup d'\u00e9tat but wanted to open up room for politicians. On the other hand, Stauffenberg is shown as being driven by the persecution and murdering of the Jews. But in reality, the Holocaust was the primary motive for only a few conspirators.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Steinbach|first=Peter|date=2009-01-22|title=Die uns\u00e4glichen Fehler im Film \"Operation Walk\u00fcre\"|url=https://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/article106775690/Historiker-Steinbach-Die-unsaeglichen-Fehler-im-Film-Operation-Walkuere.html|access-date=2022-02-18|website=Hamburger Abendblatt|language=de}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 2008]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://valkyrie.unitedartists.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|0985699|Valkyrie}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|valkyrie|Valkyrie}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Valkyrie}}\n* {{Mojo title|valkyrie|Valkyrie}}\n<!-- http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/valkyrie-v392441 -->\n\n{{Bryan Singer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2000s political thriller films]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American political thriller films]]\n[[Category:Babelsberg Studio films]]\n[[Category:Bad Hat Harry Productions films]]\n[[Category:Casting controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Cruise/Wagner Productions films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Film controversies in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films about Nazis]]\n[[Category:Films about assassinations]]\n[[Category:Films about the 20 July plot]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bryan Singer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bryan Singer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Ottman]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Films set in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tunisia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Christopher McQuarrie]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Scientology-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Thriller films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Films about coups d'\u00e9tat]]\n[[Category:World War II films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Albert Speer]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Heinrich Himmler]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joseph Goebbels]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gilbert Adler]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]"}]}}}}
