[[Olympia Dukakis]], [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]], [[Wendy Crewson]], [[Alberta Watson]], and [[Kristen Thomson]] are featured in supporting roles. The feature film [[directorial debut]] of Polley, it is based on [[Alice Munro]]'s short story \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\", from the 2001 collection ''[[Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage]]''.\n\nThe story centers on a couple whose marriage is tested when the wife begins to develop [[Alzheimer's]] and moves into a [[nursing home]], where she loses virtually all memory of her husband and begins to develop a close relationship with another nursing home resident.\n\n''Away from Her'' premiered at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]] and the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It was theatrically released on May 4, 2007, and garnered critical acclaim, with critics praising Christie's performance and Polley's screenplay and direction. \nThe film received two nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Christie) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Polley). It also won seven [[28th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nGrant and Fiona are a retired married couple living in rural [[Brant County, Ontario]]. Fiona begins to lose her memory, and it becomes apparent she has [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Throughout the film, Grant's reflections on his marriage are woven with his reflections on his own infidelities, and influence his eventual decisions regarding Fiona's happiness.\n\nWhen she feels she is becoming a risk to herself, Fiona decides to check into a [[nursing home]], where one of the rules is that a patient cannot have any visitors for the first 30 days, in order to \"adjust\". Despite being wary of this policy, Grant agrees at the insistence of his wife whom he loves. During the drive to the home, Fiona acknowledges Grant's past infidelity while he was a university professor. Despite the awkward situation, the couple makes love one last time before separating.\n\nWhen the 30-day period ends, Grant goes to visit his wife again, only to find she has forgotten him, and turned her affections to Aubrey, a mute man in a wheelchair who has become her \"[[coping (psychology)|coping]] partner\" in the facility.  A caregiver at the facility befriends Grant and gives him some advice and support.\n\nWhile seeing his wife grow closer to Aubrey, Grant becomes an unhappy voyeur when visiting his wife at the nursing home. As time goes by and Fiona still does not remember him, Grant even wonders whether Fiona's dementia is an act, to punish him for his past indiscretions. After some time, Aubrey's wife Marian removes him from the home due to financial difficulties. This causes Fiona to sink into a deep [[depression (mood)|depression]], with her physical well-being also appearing to deteriorate. Grant is touched by this, and visits Marian in an effort to allow Fiona to see Aubrey again. He would rather see his wife happy with another man than miserable and alone. Marian initially refuses, but the meeting leads to a tentative relationship between her and Grant. As time passes, Grant continues to visit both Fiona and Marian. He eventually succeeds in taking Aubrey back to visit his wife. But in his \"moment alone\" before he brings Aubrey into Fiona's room, Fiona temporarily remembers him and the love she has for him. They embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Main cast and order per opening tombstone credits, six supporting cast order and all roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Julie Christie]] as Fiona\n*[[Gordon Pinsent]] as Grant\n*[[Olympia Dukakis]] as Marian\n*[[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Aubrey\n*[[Kristen Thomson]] as Kristy\n*[[Wendy Crewson]] as Madeleine\n*[[Nina Dobrev]] as Monica \n*Stacey LaBerge as Young Fiona\n*Deanna Dezmari as Veronica\n*[[Clare Coulter]] as Phoebe Hart\n*Thomas Hauff as William Hart\n*[[Alberta Watson]] as Dr. Fischer\n*[[Grace Lynn Kung]] as Nurse Betty\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = Director [[Sarah Polley]] adapted her screenplay from [[Alice Munro]]'s story.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Sarah Polley cropped 2009.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Alice Munro.jpg\n | width2    = 157\n | alt2      = \n}}\n[[Sarah Polley]] read the short story \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\" in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' when she was on a flight from working on [[Hal Hartley]]'s ''[[No Such Thing (film)|No Such Thing]]'' in Iceland.
