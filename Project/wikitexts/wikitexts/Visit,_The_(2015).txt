Night Shyamalan]] and starring [[Olivia DeJonge]], [[Ed Oxenbould]], [[Deanna Dunagan]], [[Peter McRobbie]], and [[Kathryn Hahn]]. The film centers around two young siblings, teenage Becca and her younger brother Tyler who live with their single divorced mother, who had left home 15 years ago and is estranged from her parents. After finding their grandchildren online and wanting to meet them, the grandparents invite them to spend a week at their farmhouse, while their mother goes on a cruise with her boyfriend.\n\nThe film was released in North America on September 11, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It grossed $98.4 million worldwide against a $5 million production budget and received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with many calling it a return-to-form for Shyamalan's career.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo siblings from Philadelphia, 15-year-old Becca and 13-year-old Tyler, prepare for a five-day visit with their grandparents while their divorced mother Loretta goes on a cruise with her boyfriend. Loretta reveals that she has not spoken to her parents in 15 years after marrying her high-school teacher, of whom her parents disapproved. Having never met their grandparents, the teens plan to record a documentary film about their visit using a camcorder.\n\nBecca and Tyler meet their grandparents, referred to as \"Nana\" and \"Pop Pop,\" at a train station. When they arrive at their isolated farmhouse, Becca and Tyler are instructed to never go into the basement because it contains mold, and that bedtime is at 9:30 every evening, after which they should not leave their room. Although at first, the grandparents seem pleasant, their behavior gradually becomes peculiar. The first night, an hour past curfew, Becca ventures downstairs for something to eat and sees Nana projectile vomiting. During the day, Nana creepily chases the teens who are playing [[hide-and-seek]]. Later, Tyler finds a pile of soiled diapers in the shed. In town, Pop Pop attacks a man he thinks is following them. When challenged, both grandparents are dismissive of each other's behavior. As the erratic behavior intensifies, Becca and Tyler's documentary-style film evolves into one of mystery-solving and evidence collection.\n\nA woman Nana and Pop Pop helped in counseling brings a blueberry [[Cobbler (food)|cobbler]] round to thank them, but following a confrontation, is not seen leaving. Concerned about her grandparents\u2019 behavior, Becca checks the internet and concludes it is normal behavior for older people and a chat with Loretta reinforces this. Concerned about the events, Tyler decides to secretly film the living room during the night, but Nana discovers the camera and tries unsuccessfully to break into the children's locked bedroom with a knife.\n\nUpon watching the footage of Nana with the knife, Becca and Tyler video call Loretta and beg her to collect them. Upon showing Loretta her parents while they are outside, she unnervingly declares they are not her parents. Realizing they have been staying with strangers, the teenagers try to leave the house, and suddenly discover Nana and Pop Pop hanged the woman from a tree, and forcefully encourage them to play [[Yahtzee]]. Later, Becca sneaks into the basement and finds the decomposed corpses of their real grandparents, along with uniforms from the [[psychiatric hospital]] at which they worked, revealing the impostors as escaped patients. Pop Pop grabs Becca and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana, who tries to attack her in a psychotic fit. He then torments Tyler psychologically by smearing his face with his dirty diaper. Following a struggle, Becca fatally stabs Nana with a glass shard from a broken mirror, then runs to the kitchen and attacks Pop Pop. As Pop Pop gains the upper hand, Tyler knocks him to the floor and kills him by repeatedly bashing his head with the refrigerator door. The teens escape outside unharmed, where they are met by their mother and police officers.\n\nIn the aftermath, Becca asks Loretta about what happened the day she left home 15 years ago. Loretta states that she had a major argument with her parents, during which she hit her mother and was then struck by her father. Loretta then left home and ignored their attempts to contact her. Loretta concludes that reconciliation was always possible had she wanted it. She then tells Becca not to hold on to anger over her father's abandonment, upon which she includes footage of him in the documentary after earlier saying she wouldn't do so.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Olivia DeJonge]] as Becca<ref name=\"CAST\"/>\n* [[Ed Oxenbould]] as Tyler<ref name=\"CAST\"/>\n* [[Deanna Dunagan]] as Marja Bella Jamison (Claire), also known as \"Nana\"<ref name=\"CAST\"/>\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Frederick Spencer Jamison (Mitchell), also known as \"Pop Pop\"<ref name=\"CAST\"/>\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Loretta Jamison, Becca and Tyler's mother<ref name=CAST>{{cite web|title=The Visit also stars Erica Lynne Marszalek, Peter McRobbie, Olivia DeJonge, Deanna Dunagan, Benjamin Kanes, Jon Douglas Rainey, Brian Gildea, Shawn Gonzalez, Richard Barlow, Steve Annan, and Michael Mariano|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3331508/m-night-shyamalan-begins-work-next-supernatural-thriller|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>\n* Patch Darragh as Dr. Sam\n* [[Celia Keenan-Bolger]] as Stacey\n* [[Benjamin Kanes]] as Corin, Becca and Tyler's father<ref name=\"CAST\"/>\n\n==Production==\nAfter ''[[The Last Airbender (film)|The Last Airbender]]'' and ''[[After Earth]]'' failed critically, Shyamalan funded ''The Visit'' by borrowing $5 million against his home.{{r|hiatt20181220}} Filming began on February 19, 2014, under the preliminary title ''Sundowning''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2014/m-night-shyamalan-is-now-shooting-microbudget-horror-sundowning/ |title=M.

Every Hollywood studio passed on the [[rough cut]], and Shyamalan feared that he would lose the millions he had invested in the film.{{r|hiatt20181220}} Shyamalan admitted that he had trouble keeping the tone for the film consistent during the editing phase, telling [[Bloody Disgusting]] that the first cut of the film resembled an [[Art house|art house film]] more than a horror film. A second cut went in the opposite direction and the film became a comedy. He eventually struck a middle balance and cut the film as a thriller, which, according to him, helped tie the different elements together as they \"could stay in service of the movie\".<ref name=truehorror>{{cite web|title=[Interview] M.
