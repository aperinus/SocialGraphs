It is a sequel to Kurosawa's 1961 ''[[Yojimbo]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1751205/Sanjuro |title=Sanjuro |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=3 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nOriginally an adaptation of the [[Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto]] novel ''Hibi Heian'', the script was altered following the success of the previous year's ''Yojimbo'' to incorporate the lead character of that film.\n\n==Plot==\nNine young samurai believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a [[r\u014dnin]] overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help.\n\nBy the time the samurai get to Mutsuta's house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the r\u014dnin's suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent's compound. When Mutsuta's wife asks the r\u014dnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding [[camellia]] trees and says it is {{nihongo|Tsubaki Sanj\u016br\u014d|\u693f\u4e09\u5341\u90ce}}, literally \"thirty-year-old camellia\". The lady then criticises 'Sanjuro' for killing too frequently and insists that \"the best sword is kept in its sheath.\"\n\nSanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake.\n\nThe chamberlain's whereabouts are not discovered until next day, when Mutsuta's wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent's compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream.\n\nThe first part of the plan works, with the superintendent's forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them\u2014his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent's forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again.\n\nMutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits [[hara-kiri]], much to the chamberlain's regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off and find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel.\n\nSanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find ease by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry and says he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Actor\n!Role\n|-\n|[[Toshiro Mifune]]\n|Sanjuro Tsubaki\n|-\n|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]\n|Hanbei Muroto\n|-\n|[[Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama]]\n|Iori Izaka\n|-\n|[[Reiko Dan]]\n|Chidori\n|-\n|[[Takashi Shimura]]\n|Kurofuji\n|-\n|[[Kamatari Fujiwara]]\n|Takebayashi\n|-\n|[[Takako Irie]]\n|Mutsuta's wife\n|-\n|[[Sachio Sakai]]\n|[[Ashigaru]]\n|-\n|[[Masao Shimizu]]\n|Kikui\n|-\n|[[Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d]]\n|Mutsuta, the Chamberlain\n|}\n\n==Production==\nThe story is primarily based on [[Sh\u016bgor\u014d Yamamoto]]'s short story {{nihongo|''Hibi Heian''|\u65e5\u65e5\u5e73\u5b89||lit. \"Peaceful Days\"}}. Originally ''Sanjuro'' was to be a straight adaptation of the story. After the success of ''[[Yojimbo]]'' the studio decided to resurrect its popular [[antihero]], and Kurosawa reimagined the script accordingly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richie|first=Donald|author-link=Donald Richie|title=The films of Akira Kurosawa|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=Kurosawa Akira: Tsukuru to iu koto wa subarashii|trans-title=Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to Create|people=Yoshinari Okamoto (director)|date=2002|language=ja}}</ref> But despite a certain element of continuity, the eventual film turned out to be more than just a sequel to ''Yojimbo'' for the hero goes on to develop in character from the swashbuckling original.\n\nHe is, as before a masterless samurai who preserves his anonymity by the same means. When asked his name in ''Yojimbo'' he looks outside and names himself mulberry (''Kuwabatake''); in ''Sanjuro'' he chooses a camellia (''Tsubaki''). In both cases he gives ''Sanj\u016br\u014d'' (thirty-year-old) as his given name, although in both films he admits to being closer to forty.<ref>Roger Ebert, Great Movies III, University of Chicago Press, 2010, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hMBfjIQjJ9oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false pp.411-14]</ref> Having the ''ronin'' take the name of local agricultural products rather than a great house or clan reflects a populist turn in contemporary samurai movies.<ref>Conrad, David A. (2022). ''Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan'', p151-153, McFarland & Co.</ref> A crucial difference between ''Yojimbo'' and ''Sanjuro'', however, is that there is little connection to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] in the sequel. The original was set in an out-of-the-way border town where the hero deals ruthlessly with local thugs, while in ''Sanjuro'' the action centres on a Japanese feudal power struggle in a clan fortress town. There the hero realises that Hanbei, his main opponent, is a man much like himself: a social outsider (an \"unsheathed sword\" in the words of the chamberlain\u2019s wife) free to pick his own side in a conflict. The difference between them is only in the motives behind their choice.<ref>Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, Kurosawa: Film Studies and Japanese Cinema, Duke University Press, 2000, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QizaCOjKs-IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false p.294-302]</ref>\n\nThere is also a greater element of social comedy, with the seasoned fighter constantly hampered by the failure to grasp the true situation by the young men he chooses to help. But while he is their superior in tactics, the lady he has just rescued confounds him by insisting that he restrain himself, since killing people is a bad habit. Although there has to be some killing, largely as result of the inept actions of his young allies, the only truly violent moment comes at the very end in the duel between Sanjuro and Hanbei. From this he walks away in a fury, because his young admirers are still unable to read human nature and understand the significance of what has just happened.<ref>Brian Eggert, Deep Focus Review, [https://deepfocusreview.com/definitives/sanjuro/ July 4, 2011]</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Sanjuro'' was released on January 1, 1962 in Japan where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=188}} The film was also released in the same year in the United States.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=188}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Sanjuro'' was Toho's highest-grossing film in 1962, coming second place for the highest grossing Japanese productions in 1962.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=188}} It earned {{JPY|450.1 million}} in [[distributor rentals]] at the Japanese box office in 1962, exceeding ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'',<ref name=\"Japan1960s\">{{cite web |title=Die gr\u00f6\u00dften japanischen Kassenerfolge der 1960er Jahre |trans-title=Biggest Japanese Box Office Hits of the 1960s |url=https://www.nippon-kino.net/die-groumlszligten-japanischen-kassenerfolge-der-1960er-jahre.html |website=Nippon-Kino |language=de |access-date=19 March 2022}}</ref> which had sold {{nowrap|11.2 million}} tickets in Japan that year.<ref name=\"Ryfle\">{{cite book |last=Ryfle |first=Steve |url=https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/310/mode/1up |title=Japan's Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |publisher=ECW Press |year=1998 |isbn=9781550223484 |page=310}}</ref>\n\nMifune's sword fighting in the film was used in an extensive illustrated example of \"samurai virtuosity with his sword\" in ''This Is Kendo'', a 1989 [[kendo]] manual published in English.<ref>{{cite book|title=This is Kendo - the art of Japanese fencing|first1=Junzo|last1=Sasamori|first2=Gordon|last2=Warner|author2-link=Gordon Warner|isbn=0-8048-1607-7|year=1989|pages=38\u201341}}</ref>\n\nThe film has been positively received by critics.
