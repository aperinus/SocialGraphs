The thirty-four-minute short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the [[M\u00e9nilmontant]] neighbourhood of [[Paris]].\n\nLamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a young girl.\n\nThe film won numerous awards, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lamorisse for writing the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] in 1956 and the [[Short Film Palme d'Or|Palme d'Or for short films]] at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]]. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his apartment window, as his mother will not allow it inside.\n\nThe balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. That alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up inside his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a young girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like his.\n\nOne Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding [[beadle]].\n\nAs Pascal and the balloon wander around the neighborhood, a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon, steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery, however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch up to them. They hold Pascal back as they bring the balloon down with sling shots and stones before one of them destroys it by stomping on it.\n\nThe film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a [[cluster balloon]] ride over the city.\n\n==Themes==\nAs the film was filmed in Paris after [[World War II]], its [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood. In contrast, the balloon's bright color acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Koresky|first=Michael|title=The Red Balloon|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/655-the-red-balloon|website=The Criterion Collection|date=28 April 2008|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref> The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its \"spirit\" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said{{By whom|date=September 2022}} to be a metaphor for Christ.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://alisashortfilm.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/the-red-balloon-1956/|last=Hathaway|first=Alisa|title=The Red Balloon (1956)|date=28 February 2011|work=Notes on Short Film|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref>  Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/778-the-red-balloon-written-on-the-wind|last=Selznick|first=Brian|title=''The Red Balloon'': Written on the Wind|website=The Criterion Collection|date=19 November 2008|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\nThe theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child's gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.<ref name=\"Kennicott\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|work=The Washington Post|date=23 November 2007|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, \u201cin a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader\u201d. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breen|first=Myles P.|date=1978|title=The Rhetoric of the Short Film|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=30|issue=3|pages=3\u201313|jstor=20687433}}</ref>\nThough both poems and the film could arguably be said to have a narrative.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film serves as a color record of the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the school, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous caf\u00e9 \"Au Repos de la Montagne\", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the [[Parc de Belleville]]. The apartment where Pascal lives with his mother, located at 15, rue du Transvaal, the church, known as the [[\u00c9glise Notre-Dame-de-la-Croix de M\u00e9nilmontant]], and the bus stop Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-M\u00e9nilmontant, located at the intersection of rue des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es and rue de M\u00e9nilmontant, still stand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.furoremagazine.com/exemples/|last=Schreuders|first=Piet|title=Het Parijs van Le Ballon Rouge|date=8 February 2012|work=Furore|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"\" heights=\"140\">\nPascal%27s_apartment_in_the_Red_Balloon_(15_rue_du_Transvaal,_75020_Paris).jpg|The building hosting Pascal's apartment (15 rue du Transvaal)\nRue_des_Envierges_and_rue_du_Transvaal_(Paris,_20th_arrondissement).jpg|This view is seen in the film.

The film critic for ''[[the New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]], hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing: \"Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E7DC1639E33BBC4A52DFB566838C649EDE|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Screen: Documentary and Fantasy; 'Lost Continent,' 'Red Balloon' on Bill|work=The New York Times|date=12 March 1957|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by [[Janus Films]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote: \"More than any other children's film, ''The Red Balloon'' turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see ''The Red Balloon'' is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162166,00.html|last=Gliebermann|first=Owen|title=The Red Balloon|work=EW.com|date=21 November 2007|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic Brian Gibson wrote: \"So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of [[Adolf Hitler's]] war a decade earlier. But soon people\u2019s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, ''The Red Balloon'' taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7536|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205160335/http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7536|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 February 2013|last=Gibson|first=Brian|title=What childhood films are these?|work=archive.is|date=5 February 2007|access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a review in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: \"[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. ''The Red Balloon'' may be the most seamless fusion of [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop\u2013-think [[Calvary]]\u2013-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the [[New Testament]]. Thus is investment rewarded-\u2013with Christian [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] or, at least, an old-fashioned [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith.\"<ref name=\"Kennicott\"/>\n\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 95% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twenty reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"''The Red Balloon'' invests the simplest of narratives with spectacular visual inventiveness, making for a singularly wondrous portrait of innocence.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_balloon/ ''The Red Balloon''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
