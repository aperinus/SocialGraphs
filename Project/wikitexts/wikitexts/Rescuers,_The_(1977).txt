The 23rd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story follows Bernard and Bianca, two members of the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world. The two mice must free young orphan Penny from two treasure hunters, who intend to use her to help them obtain a giant diamond. The film is based on a series of books by [[Margery Sharp]], most notably ''[[The Rescuers (book)|The Rescuers]]'' (1959) and ''Miss Bianca'' (1962).\n\n''The Rescuers'' entered development in 1962, but was shelved due to [[Walt Disney]]'s dislike of the project's political overtones. During the 1970s, the film was revived as a project for the younger animators, but it was taken over by the senior animation staff following the release of ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973). ''The Rescuers'' was released on June 22, 1977, to positive critical reception and became a box office success. The film was also successful throughout the world, including [[France]] and [[West Germany]]. Due to the film's success, a sequel titled ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was released in 1990, which made this film the first Disney animated film to have a sequel.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current count is 523 words. -->\nIn an abandoned riverboat in Devil's Bayou, [[Louisiana]], a young orphan named Penny drops a [[message in a bottle]], containing a plea for help, into the river. The Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization inside the [[United Nations Secretariat Building|United Nations]], finds the bottle when it washes up in [[New York City]]. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] representative, Miss Bianca, volunteers to accept the case. She chooses Bernard, a stammering janitor, as her co-agent. The two visit Morningside Orphanage, where Penny lived, and meet an old [[cat]] named Rufus. He tells them about a sketchy woman named Madame Medusa who once tried to lure Penny into her car, and may have succeeded in abducting Penny this time.\n\nThe mice travel to Medusa's [[pawn shop]], where they discover that she and her partner, Mr. Snoops, are on a quest to find the world's largest [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]], the Devil's Eye. The mice learn that Medusa and Snoops are currently at the Devil's Bayou with Penny, whom they have indeed kidnapped and placed under the guard of two trained crocodiles, Brutus and Nero. With the help of an [[albatross]] named Orville and a [[dragonfly]] named Evinrude, the mice follow Medusa to the [[bayou]]. There, they learn that Medusa plans to force Penny to enter a small [[Blowhole (geology)|blowhole]] that leads down into a blocked-off [[pirate]]s' cave where the Devil's Eye is located.\n\nBernard and Bianca find Penny and devise a plan of escape. They send Evinrude to alert the local animals, who loathe Medusa, but Evinrude is delayed when he is forced to take shelter from a cloud of [[bat]]s. The following morning, Medusa and Snoops send Penny down into the cave to find the gem. Unbeknownst to Medusa, Bianca and Bernard are hiding in Penny's skirt pocket. The three soon find the Devil's Eye within a pirate skull. As Penny pries the mouth open with a sword, the mice push the gem through it, but soon the oceanic tide rises and floods the cave. The three barely manage to retrieve the diamond and escape.\n\nMedusa betrays Snoops and hides the diamond in Penny's teddy bear, while holding Penny and Snoops at gunpoint. When she trips over a cable set as a trap by Bernard and Bianca, Medusa loses the bear and the diamond to Penny, who runs away with them. The local animals arrive at the riverboat and aid Bernard and Bianca in trapping Brutus and Nero, then set off Mr. Snoops's [[fireworks]] to create more chaos. Meanwhile, Penny and the mice commandeer Medusa's swamp-mobile, a makeshift [[airboat]]. Medusa unsuccessfully pursues them, using Brutus and Nero as water-skis. As the riverboat sinks from the fireworks' damage, Medusa crashes and is left clinging to the boat's smoke stacks. Mr. Snoops escapes on a [[raft]] and laughs at her, while the irritated Brutus and Nero turn on her and circle below.\n\nBack in New York City, the Rescue Aid Society watch a news report of how Penny found the Devil's Eye, which has been given to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Penny has also been [[adoption|adopted]]. The meeting is interrupted when Evinrude arrives with a call for help, sending Bernard and Bianca on a new adventure.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Bernard, Rescue Aid Society's timid janitor, who reluctantly tags along with Miss Bianca on her journey to the Devil's Bayou to rescue Penny. He is highly superstitious about the number 13 and dislikes flying (the latter being a personality trait of Newhart).\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Miss Bianca, the Hungarian representative of the Rescue Aid Society. She is sophisticated and adventurous, and fond of Bernard, choosing him as her co-agent as she sets out to rescue Penny. Her Hungarian nationality was derived from that of her voice actress.\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Madame Medusa, a greedy, redheaded, wicked pawn-shop owner. Upon discovering the Devil's Eye diamond hidden in a [[blowhole (geology)|blowhole]], she kidnaps the small orphan, Penny, to retrieve it for her, as Penny is the only one small enough to fit in it. She has two pet crocodiles, who turn on her after she is thwarted by Bernard, Bianca, and Penny.\n* Michelle Stacy as Penny, a lonely six-year-old orphan girl, residing at Morningside Orphanage in New York City. She is kidnapped by Medusa in an attempt to retrieve the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye.\n* [[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Mr. Snoops, Medusa's clumsy and incompetent business partner, who obeys his boss's orders to steal the Devil's Eye in exchange for half of it. Upon being betrayed by Medusa, however, he turns on her and flees by raft, laughing at her. This was Flynn's final role before his death in 1974.\n* [[Jim Jordan (actor)|Jim Jordan]] as Orville (named after Orville Wright of the [[Wright brothers]], the inventors of the [[airplane]]; most likely influenced from Bob Newhart's stand-up sketch \"[[The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart|Merchandising the Wright Brothers]]\"), an albatross who gives Bernard and Bianca a ride to Devil's Bayou. Jordan, 80 years old by the time the film was completed, had been lured out of retirement and had not performed since the death of his wife and comic partner [[Marian Driscoll Jordan|Marian]] in 1961; it would serve as Jordan's last public performance.\n* [[John McIntire]] as Rufus, an elderly cat who resides at Morningside Orphanage and comforts Penny when she is sad. Although his time onscreen is rather brief, he provides the film's most important theme, faith. He was designed by animator [[Ollie Johnston]], who retired after the film following a 40-year career with Disney.\n* [[Jeanette Nolan]] as Ellie Mae and [[Pat Buttram]] as Luke, two [[muskrat]]s who reside in a Southern-style home on a patch of land in Devil's Bayou. Luke drinks very strong, homemade [[liquor]], which is used to help Bernard and Evinrude regain energy when they need it. Its most important usage is for fuel for powering Medusa's swamp-mobile in the film's climax.\n* [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|James MacDonald]] as Evinrude (named after a [[Evinrude Outboard Motors|brand of outboard motors]]), a [[dragonfly]] who mans a [[leaf boat]] across Devil's Bayou, giving Bernard and Miss Bianca a ride across the swamp waters.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Mr. Chairman, the chairman to the Rescue Aid Society.\n* [[George Lindsey]] as Deadeye, a fisher rabbit who is one of Luke and Ellie Mae's friends.\n* Larry Clemmons as Gramps, a grumpy, yet kind old turtle who carries a brown cane.\n* [[Dub Taylor]] as Digger, a mole.\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Deacon Owl\n* [[Shelby Flint]] as Singer, Bottle\n* Bill McMillian as TV Announcer\n\n==Production==\nIn 1959, the book ''[[The Rescuers (book)|The Rescuers]]'' by Margery Sharp had been published to considerable success. In 1962, Sharp followed up with a sequel titled ''Miss Bianca''. That same year, the books were optioned by [[Walt Disney]], who began developing an animated film adaptation. In January 1963, story artist Otto Englander wrote a [[film treatment|treatment]] based on the first book, centering on a Norwegian poet unfairly imprisoned in a [[Siberia]]-like stronghold known as the Black Castle. The story was revised with the location changed to [[Cuba]], in which the mice would help the poet escape into the United States. However, as the story became overtly involved in international intrigue, Disney shelved the project as he was unhappy with the political overtones.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|pp=153\u2013154}} In August 1968, Englander wrote another treatment featuring Bernard and Bianca rescuing [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Ghez|2019|p=49}}\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the project was revived as a project for the young animators, led by [[Don Bluth]], as the studio would alternate between full-scale \"A pictures\" and smaller, scaled-back \"B pictures\" with simpler animation. The animators had selected the most recent book, ''Miss Bianca in the Antarctic'', to adapt from. The new story involved a [[King penguin]] deceiving a captured polar bear into performing in shows aboard a [[schooner]], causing the unsatisfied bear to place a bottle that would reach the mice.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/mouseunderglasss0000koen/page/154/mode/1up 154]}} This version of the story was later dropped because Fred Lucky, a storyboard artist, explained that the Arctic setting \"was too stark a background for the animators.\"{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/mouseunderglasss0000koen/page/154/mode/1up 154]}} Mattinson later explained, \"Our problem was that the penguin wasn't formidable or evil enough for the audience to believe he would dominate the big bear. We struggled with that for a year or so. We changed the locale to somewhere in America and it was now a regular zoo and we tried to come up with something with the bear in the zoo and needing to be rescued but that didn't work either.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nIn that version, the bear character was still retained, but was renamed Louie the Bear. Jazz singer [[Louis Prima]] was cast in the role and had recorded most of the dialogue and multiple songs that were composed by [[Floyd Huddleston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/lost-louis-prima-disney-song-47801.html|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=Lost Louis Prima Disney Song|website=[[Cartoon Brew]]|date=August 15, 2011|access-date=December 10, 2012}}</ref> The writers also expanded the role of his best friend, Gus the Lion.{{sfn|Solomon|2008|p=9}} Huddleston had stated, \"It's about two animals. One is Louis Prima \u2014 he's the polar bear \u2014 and [[Redd Foxx]] is the lion ...Louis gets cornered into leaving and going to the South Pole where he can make himself a bigger star.

Gerry explained, \"We developed the sequence where, while the two mice are searching for clues as to where Penny has been taken, they come across this bear who she had been friends with because the orphanage where Penny was living was near the zoo.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} In the final film, the idea was reduced to a simple scene where Bernard enters a zoo and hears a lion's roar that scares him away.\n\n[[File:Rescuers penny.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Penny struggles to free the Devil's Eye diamond from a pirate's [[human skull|skull]]; the filmmakers carefully designed every shot of the scene to raise the tension.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knowles|first1=Rebecca|last2=Bunyan|first2=Dan|chapter=Animal Heroes|page=80|title=Disney: The Ultimate Visual Guide|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-0-789488-62-6|year=2002}}</ref>]]\n\nIn [[Europe]], while promoting the release of ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973), Reitherman stated: \"I took Margery Sharp's books along and there was in there a mean woman in a crystal palace. When I got back I called some of the guys together and I said, 'We've got to get a villain in this thing.{{' \"}}{{sfn|Ghez|2019|p=49}} The villainess and her motive to steal a diamond was adapted from the Diamond Duchess in ''Miss Bianca''.

We're gonna have a new character. I'm not gonna do Cruella',\" Mattinson recalled, \"Because he felt that [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc]] [Davis had animated] Cruella beautifully. He was not gonna go and take his character.\"{{sfn|Ghez|2019|p=51}}\n\nThe new version of the character was renamed Madame Medusa, and her appearance was based on Kahl's then-wife, Phyllis Bounds (who was the niece of [[Lillian Disney]]), whom he divorced in 1978.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=156}} This was Kahl's last film for the studio, and he wanted his final character to be his best; he was so insistent on perfecting Madame Medusa that he ended up doing almost all the animation for the character himself.<ref>{{cite web|work=Disney Archives: Villains|title=''Madame Medusa''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302115813/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/medusa/medusa.html|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/medusa/medusa.html|archive-date=March 2, 2011|access-date=April 23, 2009}}</ref> The kidnapped child Penny was inspired by Patience, the orphan in the novel. The alligator characters Brutus and Nero was based on the two bloodhounds, Tyrant and Torment, in the novels. For the henchman, the filmmakers adapted the character, Mandrake, into Mr. Snoops.

Since Jim Jordan, who had voiced Orville, had since died, a new character, Wilbur (Orville's brother, another albatross), was created and voiced by [[John Candy]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[1977 in film]]\n* [[List of American films of 1977]]\n* [[List of animated feature films of 1977]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing animated films]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing films in France]]\n* [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n* [[List of Disney theatrical animated feature films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|50em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Canemaker |first=John |title=Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Disney Editions |isbn=978-0-7868-6496-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ghez|first=Didier|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/They_Drew_as_They_Pleased_Vol_5/9l2vDwAAQBAJ|title=They Drew as They Pleased Vol. 5: The Hidden Art of Disney's Early Renaissance|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|year=2019|isbn=978-1-7972-0410-9}} \n* {{cite book|last=Koenig|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/mouseunderglasss0000koen|title=Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation & Theme Parks|chapter=The Rescuers|url-access=registration|location=[[Irvine, California]]|publisher=Bonaventure Press|pages=153\u2013161|isbn=978-0-9640-6051-7|year=1997}}\n* {{cite book|last=Renault|first=Christian|editor-last=Ghez|editor-first=Didier|title=Walt's People: Volume 5 \u2014 Talking Disney with the Artists Who Knew Him|chapter=Vance Gerry (1929\u20132005)|publisher=Theme Park Press|year=1998|isbn=978-1-6839-0011-5}}\n* {{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=Disney Lost and Found: Exploring the Hidden Artwork from Never-Produced Animation|location=New York|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4231-1601-1}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |last=Korkis |first=Jim |url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/13099/Remembering_the_Rescuers |title=Remembering the Rescuers |website=Mouse Planet |date=January 19, 2022}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/the-rescuers}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|40980}}\n* {{IMDb title|0076618}}\n* {{tcmdb title|24415|The Rescuers}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|rescuers}}\n* {{mojo title|rescuers}}\n\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n{{Wolfgang Reitherman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rescuers}}\n[[Category:1970s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1970s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:1977 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1977 animated films]]\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Animated films about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated films about mice]]\n[[Category:Animated films about reptiles and amphibians]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on children's books]]\n[[Category:Animated films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Film controversies]]\n[[Category:Disney controversies]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Margery Sharp]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works of a series]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Lounsbery]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wolfgang Reitherman]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Art Stevens]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ron W.
