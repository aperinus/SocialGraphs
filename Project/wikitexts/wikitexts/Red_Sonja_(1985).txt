It is based on the character created by [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Red Sonya of Rogatino]],<ref name=\"afi\" /> who also inspired the comic book character [[Red Sonja|of the same name]]. The film introduces [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as the title character, with [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Paul L. Smith|Paul Smith]], [[Ronald Lacey]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in supporting roles.\n\nAs in Howard's stories of Conan, the film takes place in the [[Hyborian Age]], a fictional prehistoric time that had been depicted previously in the films ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) and ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984).\n\n''Red Sonja'' was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 1985, by [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.]] Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It grossed $6.9 million in the United States under a budget of $17.9 million, becoming a [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nSonja, a young, red-haired woman, is raped and left for dead by the soldiers of Queen Gedren, a despot who murdered Sonja's parents and brother after she rejected the queen's sexual advances and scarred her face. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess, [[Sc\u00e1thach]], appears to her and gives her heightened strength, stamina, agility and fighting skills on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat. She trains under a sword master called \"The Grand Master\" and is distrustful of all men besides him. At a nearby temple, Varna, Sonja's sister, is a member of an order of priestesses who are preparing to banish a mystical light-powered relic, the Talisman, that created the world and all living things. The Talisman can only be used and touched by women \u2013 men vanish if they touch it \u2013 and has become too powerful to control. However, Gedren's army and her [[aide-de-camp]] Ikol intervene and slaughter most of the priestesses and shield maidens before they can imprison the Talisman in permanent darkness.\n\nVarna watches Gedren steal the Talisman and imprison the surviving priestesses in the vault that contained it before escaping, but is mortally wounded. She is discovered by [[Conan the Barbarian|Kalidor]], the Lord of Hyrkania, who goes to find Sonja and bring her back to Varna. Before dying, Varna tells Sonja to find the Talisman and send it into darkness before it ravages the world with storms and earthquakes. Kalidor asks to accompany her, but she rejects the offer. After witnessing the Talisman in use, Sonja arrives to the now-ruined kingdom of Hablock. She meets the young, pig-headed Prince Tarn and his servant/bodyguard Falkon, who say that Gedren used the Talisman to completely decimate Hablock when Tarn refused to surrender. Tarn, demanding vengeance, announces that he will crush Gedren and invites Sonja to work for him as a cook. She politely declines before being told that Gedren is based in Berkubane, the land of Perpetual Night.\n\nArriving at the mountain gate, Sonja fights Lord Brytag after he refuses her passage for not paying him a 'tender tribute'. When she kills him and takes his key, his troops surround her; Kalidor, who has secretly been following her, attacks their rear, allowing Sonja to escape. Sonja comes across Tarn again, being tortured by bandits. She frees Tarn and kills the bandits with Falkon. They decide to stay together and travel onward toward Berkubane, and Tarn takes Sonja's advice and utilises some good manners over sword practice. Gedren's wizard uses a large magic dish to show the approaching party; Gedren recognizes Sonja and orders that she be brought to the fortress unharmed. Using the Talisman to conjure up a storm, she forces Sonja's group to take shelter in a watery cavern in Ictyan where Gedran's \u201cKilling Machine\" is unleashed upon them. Kalidor appears and helps Sonja blind the mechanical beast so they can escape.\n\nSonja accepts Kalidor's company after learning he is descended from the lords who entrusted the Talisman to the priestess temple. He flirts with her, so she warns him that \"no man can have her\" unless he can defeat her in a sword fight. Kalidor challenges her and they fight to a draw, despite Tarn trying to knobble Kalidor to tip the duel into Sonja's favour. The party arrives at Castle Berkubane and, to protect Tarn, they convince him to stay behind and guard the front entrance. Ikol, realizing Gedren is insane when she refuses his pleas to stop utilizing the unstable relic, plans to escape the castle with bags of Hablock's gold. Sonja confronts Gedren in her council chamber while Kalidor and Falkon deal with her guards in the castle's dining hall. Ikol is stopped by Tarn at the entrance and is crushed to death by the door.\n\nOverpowered by Sonja, Gedren flees to the Chamber of Lights where the Talisman is stored. Now powerful beyond control, the Talisman causes the floor to split open and reveal a chasm of molten lava beneath the castle. Sonja and Gedren duel in the Chamber; Sonja runs Gedren through with her sword, sending the evil ruler plunging into the lava below. Sonja throws the Talisman in after her, destroying it and starting a chain reaction that tears Castle Berkubane apart. The heroes manage to escape as the rising volcano consumes the castle.  Sonja and Kalidor kiss after Kalidor won against her in a sword fight while Tarn and Falkon head back to Hablock to have it rebuilt.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[Red Sonja]]\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Lord Kalidor]]\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Queen Gedren of Berkubane\n* [[Paul L.

Bergman was offered the role of Red Sonja, but turned it down, choosing instead to play the villainous Queen Gedren.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.filmwerk.co.uk/2011/03/06/comic-book-movies-red-sonja/|title=Comic Book Movies: Red Sonja|publisher=Filmwerk.co.uk|access-date=2013-10-21|archive-date=2013-10-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021233142/http://www.filmwerk.co.uk/2011/03/06/comic-book-movies-red-sonja/|url-status=live}}</ref> De Laurentiis met with actress [[Laurene Landon]] and was set to offer her the role of Red Sonja until he discovered she was in an earlier film called ''[[Hundra]]''; fearing that it was too similar, De Laurentiis decided not to give her the part. On a 2015 episode of ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'', soap opera actress [[Eileen Davidson]] revealed that she auditioned for the role and was actually runner-up to Brigitte Nielsen. It took De Laurentiis almost a year to find an actress \"Amazonian\" enough to play the title character; he was still looking, eight weeks before the scheduled production, when he saw Brigitte Nielsen on the cover of a fashion magazine. The 21-year-old native of [[Helsing\u00f8r]], [[Denmark]], in [[Milan]] for a modeling job, soon found herself on a plane heading for Rome and a successful screen test.<ref name=\"rottentomatoes1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017352-red_sonja/news/1922674/marvel_movie_madness_part_20_red_sonja/ |title=Marvel Movie Madness!
