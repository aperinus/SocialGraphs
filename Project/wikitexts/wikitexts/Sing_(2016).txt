It was written and directed by [[Garth Jennings]],<ref name=THRReview/> co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet (in his [[directorial debut|feature directorial debut]]), and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]] and [[Janet Healy]]. The film stars the ensemble voices of [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Tori Kelly]], [[Taron Egerton]] and [[Nick Kroll]]. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the film focuses on a struggling theater owner who holds a singing competition to prevent his theatre from entering foreclosure, as well as how the competition interferes with the personal lives of its contestants.\n\nThe film features more than 60 songs from famous artists, mostly performed [[Diegetic music|diegetically]]. It also has an original song by [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Ariana Grande]] called \"[[Faith (Stevie Wonder song)|Faith]]\", which was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=A Complete List of Every Song in Illumination's 'Sing' |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/complete-list-every-song-illuminations-sing-147042.html|access-date=December 28, 2016|work=Cartoon Brew|date=September 9, 2016}}</ref> It screened on the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2016, premiered at the [[Microsoft Theater]] in Los Angeles on December 3, and was released in the United States on December 21, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It grossed $634 million worldwide.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Sing 2]],'' was released on December 22, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] film summaries should not exceed 700 words. Current wordcount 635. -->\nIn Calatonia, a city of [[anthropomorphic]] animals, koala Buster Moon owns a struggling theater, and is threatened with foreclosure by bank representative llama Judith. He decides to hold a singing competition with a prize of $1,000, but a typo made by his elderly assistant iguana Miss Crawly adds two extra zeros to the prize money. The misprinted flyers are blown out of the window by a fan before they can be proofread, and float across the city.\n\nCrowds of animals gather to audition, and Buster selects his contestants. Among them are housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; [[punk-rock]] porcupine Ash; teenage gorilla Johnny, son of a criminal gang leader named Big Daddy; [[street musician]] mouse Mike; and an exuberant pig named Gunter. Teenage elephant Meena fails her audition due to [[stage fright]], Ash's self-absorbed boyfriend and co-auditionee Lance is upset to be dismissed from the contest, and Rosita is paired with Gunter for a dance routine. After Buster discovers the flyers advertise a prize of $100,000, he joins his friend sheep Eddie on a visit to Eddie's wealthy grandmother, former theatre superstar Nana Noodleman. Nana is reluctant to sponsor the prize money, but agrees to attend a private preview of the show before making a decision.\n\nPressured by her grandfather, Meena attempts to request a second audition, but settles on being Buster's [[stagehand]] instead. After some acts withdraw from the competition, Meena is offered a spot in the show, but again struggles to overcome her fear. Further problems soon arise; Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, believing her motherly duties have caused her to lose her passion; Lance cheats on Ash, causing her to break up with him, and later to break down crying during a rehearsal; Mike, assuming he will win the competition, takes out a massive loan from the bank to buy a flashy car and swindles a group of bears in a card game; and Johnny, forced by Big Daddy to partake in a heist as a getaway driver, sneaks away to a rehearsal. Traffic prevents Johnny from returning to the heist in time, resulting in the arrest and incarceration of Big Daddy and his gang, straining their relationship.\n\nDesperate, Johnny attempts to steal the prize money for his father's bail, but when he sees a note on Buster's desk praising his talents, Johnny resolves to focus on his musical career instead. On the day of the preview, the bears Mike had cheated locate him, and demand their money back. Mike directs them to Buster; the bears break open the prize chest, but it is nowhere near $100,000. Shocked by the lack of money, the rest of the contestants question Buster, and the glass tank of [[Bioluminescence|luminescent]] squids lighting the stage shatters under everyone's weight. The flooded theater implodes, and Judith repossesses the lot, while Buster takes up residence with Eddie and supports himself by washing cars.\n\nMeena goes to the rubble of the theater and sings out loud to music on her headphones. Overhearing her, Buster is inspired to stage an outdoor show just for fun. Despite attempts from Judith to halt the show, it takes place on the lot of the former theatre, with Meena's and Rosita's families in attendance. Dozens more animals are drawn into the audience when the show is broadcast on the news. Rosita\u2019s husband Norman finally notices his wife\u2019s talent, Big Daddy breaks out of prison and travels to the lot to reconcile with Johnny and apologize, Lance is impressed by Ash\u2019s original rock song \u201cSet It All Free\u201d, the bears find Mike and chase him away, and Meena overcomes her stage fright and gives an enthusiastic performance. The show is a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. She purchases the lot, and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.\n\n==Voice cast==<!-- DO NOT LINK TO SPECIFIC ANIMAL SPECIES, AS THIS IS WP:OR AND PER WP:COMMONWORDS -->\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200|align=right\n| image1    = Sing 07 (29144312374).jpg\n| width1    = 2268\n| height1   = 3175\n| image2    = Reese Witherspoon (29144489784).jpg\n| width2    = 2303\n| height2   = 3225\n| image3    = Sing 23 (29479903050).jpg\n| width3    = 1463\n| height3   = 2048\n| image4    = Tori Kelly, 2016 Toronto Film Festival-1.jpg\n| width4    = 2752\n| height4   = 3854\n| image5    = Taron Egerton (28990343924) (cropped).jpg\n| width5    = 1669\n| height5   = 2474\n| image6    = Nick Kroll, Sing premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.jpg\n| width6    = 314\n| height6   = 440\n| footer    = [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Tori Kelly]], [[Taron Egerton]], and [[Nick Kroll]] at the film's premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].\n}}\n{{div col}}\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Buster Moon, an optimistic koala who plans to save his theater from closure by holding a singing competition<ref name=THRMcConaughey>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Matthew McConaughey to Star in Illumination Animated Film (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/matthew-mcconaughey-star-illumination-animated-763794|access-date=August 3, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=USATSneakPeek>{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=Sneak peek: A-list animals 'SING' together |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/10/sneak-peek-sing-movie/75478808/ |access-date=November 11, 2015 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 10, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Rosita, a pig who gave up her teenage music dreams to become a devoted housewife, and mother of 25 piglets<ref name=USATSneakPeek />\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as Mike, a white mouse street singer with a big [[Frank Sinatra]]-esque voice and an arrogant attitude<ref name=USATSneakPeek />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Ash, a teenage porcupine [[punk rocker]] who takes part in an [[alternative-rock]] music duo with her boyfriend Lance<ref name=\"THRReview\" /><ref name=USATSneakPeek />\n* [[John C.
