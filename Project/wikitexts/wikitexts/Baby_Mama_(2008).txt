Now at age 37, she finally decides to have her own child, but her plans are dampened when she discovers she has a minuscule chance of becoming pregnant because of a [[T-shaped uterus]]. Also denied the chance to adopt, Kate hires an immature, obnoxious, [[South Philadelphia]]n Angie Ostrowski to become her [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]].\n\nAfter learning from Chaffee Bicknell, the steely head of their surrogacy center, that Angie has become pregnant, Kate prepares for motherhood in her own typically driven fashion, reading childcare books, baby-proofing the apartment and researching top pre-schools. However, the executive's well-organized strategy is upended when Angie shows up at her door, homeless. Their conflicting personalities put them at odds as Kate learns first-hand about balancing motherhood and career and also dates the owner of a local blended-juice cafe, Rob Ackerman.\n\nUnknown to Kate, Angie's in-vitro fertilization procedure had failed and she is feigning the pregnancy, hoping to ultimately run off with her payment. Eventually, she starts to regret lying about being pregnant, but she continually puts off confessing. \n\nWhen Angie gets an ultrasound, she discovers she is indeed pregnant. Realizing the baby is her own\u2014with her [[Common-law marriage|common-law husband]] Carl, from whom she is separated\u2014Angie is forced to confess at Kate's baby shower. When Kate explains to Angie that the pregnancy test was supposed to be taken two weeks after the procedure, so the baby could still belong to her, a wedge is driven between them.\n\nA court hearing determines that the baby is Angie's, and Angie impassionedly apologizes to Kate. As the women meet face-to-face after the proceedings, Angie's water breaks and Kate rushes her to the hospital, then passes out during the birth. As she wakes up, the doctor supervising Angie's pregnancy tells Kate that she's two months pregnant (the result of her relationship with Rob). After receiving the news, she visits Angie, who is holding her new baby daughter Stef, named for [[Gwen Stefani]]. Kate forgives Angie and they become best friends, ultimately changing each other for the better.\n\nAngie and Kate raise their children and are in a sister-like relationship one year later at Stef's first-birthday party. It is revealed that Kate and Rob are parents of a baby daughter and are engaged. Although he does not reunite with Angie, Carl stays close to his daughter and takes parenting classes. The final scene shows Angie and Kate sitting in front of a television set with their children, watching ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Holbrook - Mother\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Angela \"Angie\" Ostrowski - Surrogate mother\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Rob Ackerman - SuperFruity cafe owner\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Carl Loomis - Angie's 'Common Law' husband\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Chaffee Bicknell - Surrogate agent\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Barry Waterman - Kate's boss - Round Earth Organic Market\n* [[Romany Malco]] as Oscar Priyan - Doorman\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Caroline - Kate's sister\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Rose Holbrook - Kate's mother\n* [[Stephen Mailer]] as Dan\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as The Birthing Teacher\n* [[Kevin Collins (American actor)|Kevin Collins]] as Rick - Round Earth employee\n* [[Will Forte]] as Scott - Kate's former boyfriend\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as Dr. Manheim\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as The Stroller Salesman\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Judge\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Fertility Specialist\n* [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]] as Kate's Date\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Jonothan - Surrogate father\n* [[Dave Finkel]] as Gay Couple\n* [[Brian Stack]] as Dave\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Fey and Poehler at the premiere]]\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10.
