He chases the man and wounds him, but the chase ends when McCaleb suffers a heart attack.\n\nRetired, McCaleb lives in a Grand Banks motor cruiser on the [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] bay. He receives a second chance at life with a heart transplant. He is approached by Graciella Rivers; her sister, Gloria, was murdered during a robbery and she asks him to solve the case. He discovers that the heart transplanted into him was Gloria's. He has nightmares of the robbery during which Gloria was murdered.\n\nMcCaleb, against the advice of his physician, decides to find the murderer with the help of houseboat neighbor Buddy and local police detective Jaye Winston. McCaleb's path leads to several suspects, but he eventually realizes that Buddy is the murderer.\n\nBuddy reveals that he has kidnapped Graciella and her nephew, Gloria's son Raymond. There is a shootout on a wrecked, marooned fishing boat. After McCaleb wounds Buddy a second time, Buddy attempts to reach for his gun only to be shot dead by McCaleb. Buddy's dying words are \"I saved you.\" Graciella then reaches over and holds Buddy's face underwater, participating in his execution, getting justice for her murdered sister.  McCaleb starts another new life with Graciella and Raymond.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Terry McCaleb\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Jasper \"Buddy\" Noone\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Dr. Bonnie Fox\n* [[Wanda De Jesus|Wanda De Jes\u00fas]] as Graciella Rivers\n* [[Tina Lifford]] as Detective Jaye Winston\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Detective Ronaldo Arrango\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as Detective John Waller\n* [[Rick Hoffman]] as James Lockridge\n* Alix Koromzay as Mrs. Cordell\n* [[Igor Jijikine]] as Mikhail Bolotov\n* [[Dina Eastwood]] as Reporter #1\n* [[Beverly Leech]] as Reporter #2\n* [[Maria Quiban]] as Gloria Torres\n* Brent Hinkley as Cab Driver\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Blood Work'' was filmed in spring 2002 in Los Angeles and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, in 38 days.<ref name=\"Hughes185\">Hughes, p.185</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Blood Work'' received mixed reviews.
