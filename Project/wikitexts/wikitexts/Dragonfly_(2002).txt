It was produced by [[Gary Barber]], [[Roger Birnbaum]], [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]], and Shadyac. It starred [[Kevin Costner]] in the title role. It is about a grieving [[Physician|doctor]] being contacted by his late wife through his patients' [[near-death experience]]s. It was panned by critics and a box office failure, grossing $52.3 million against its $60 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nJoe and Emily Darrow are doctors in a [[Chicago]] hospital. Seven months pregnant Emily travels to [[Venezuela]] to help natives in the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] area. She dies when a bus is hit by a landslide and plunges into the river below. Her body is never found by the local authorities.\n\nWithout taking time to grieve Joe returns to work. One night he is awakened by his wife's [[dragonfly]] paper weight that falls and rolls across the room. His wife always had a passion for dragonflies and even had a [[birthmark]] on her shoulder which resembled a dragonfly. Joe starts visiting Emily's patients at the pediatric oncology unit in the hospital. One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the child's heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again.\n\nThe following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is \"Emily's Joe\" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his [[near death experience]], that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow.  Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must \"go to the rainbow\".\n\nWhen Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage, breaking a pot and making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Joe spots a [[dragonfly]] flying outside the window, and briefly sees Emily reaching for him outside that same window. Joe's neighbour, Miriam Belmont, tries to talk him back into reality. Instead, he goes to Sister Madeline, a controversial nun who investigated near-death experiences. Sister Madeline advises Joe that Emily is indeed trying to contact him from the other side.\n\nThe breaking point occurs at the hospital when Joe is alone with a clinically dead patient. Joe hears his wife speaking through the patient, calling his name, but no one believes him. He decides to sell his home and go on vacation. While packing away his wife's belongings, the lightbulb in the room burns out. When he returns with a new bulb, all the belongings he had packed away are suddenly back in their original places. He enters his kitchen where a map has blown open, showing the mysterious curvy cross symbol at several places. He learns from a friend that the wiggly cross is the map symbol for a waterfall. Joe remembers and finds a photo of his wife posing in front of a waterfall with a rainbow behind her.\n\nHe takes a trip to the South American area where his wife died. Joe's pilot, Victor, takes him to the victims' graves near a tribe village. Joe shows the photo of his wife and asks his native guides if they know where his wife is buried. They start arguing with each other that he should be brought to the village. Joe's attention then shifts to the village and he runs off to it. He comes to a cliff and sees the bus far down below in the water. Joe jumps into the river and enters the semi-flooded bus, causing the bus to shift and become completely submerged. Joe is trapped inside but calms down when a bright glow fills the bus and his wife appears to him, reaching for his hand. The events of her final hours flash before him, showing she survived the initial accident and was pulled to safety by nearby [[Yanomami]] villagers. He is then suddenly rescued from the bus by Victor.\n\nJoe runs to the village and is surrounded by angry native men with weapons. He holds up a photo of his wife. A native woman tells him they couldn't save her body but they saved her soul. Perplexed, he follows her into one of the huts, and inside is a female [[infant]] in a basket, the child his wife was carrying, who survived the accident. The woman shows him a birthmark on the child in the shape of a dragonfly. As he embraces his daughter he realizes what his wife was trying to tell him.\n\nThe film ends with Joe playing with his daughter, now a toddler with wavy blonde hair, the very image of his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Dr. Joe Darrow\n* [[Susanna Thompson]] as Dr. Emily Darrow\n* [[Joe Morton]] as Hugh Campbell\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Charlie Dickinson\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Miriam Belmont\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Sister Madeline\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Victor\n* [[Robert Bailey, Jr.]] as Jeffrey Reardon\n* [[Jay Thomas]] as Hal\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Eric\n* [[Lisa Banes]] as Flora\n* [[Casey Biggs]] as Neil Darrow\n* [[Leslie Hope]] as Charisse Darrow\n* [[Peter Hansen (actor)|Peter Hansen]] as Phillip Darrow\n\n==Production==\nThe project was initially set up at [[MGM]] when the script was bought for a mid six figures outbidding [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]].<ref name=\"UA\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/dragonfly-lands-at-ua-1117341908/|title=    'Dragonfly' lands at UA    |publisher=Variety|access-date=July 1, 2021}}</ref> The script was put into turnaround when MGM grew uncertain of the $75 million dollar budget with [[Shady Acres Entertainment]] reacquiring the domestic distribution rights that in turn were acquired by Universal while [[Spyglass Entertainment]] handled foreign pre-sales in a manner similar to the arrangement with ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' whose success helped give Dragonfly the traction it needed to move into production.<ref name=\"Costner\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/costner-eyes-dragonfly-1117786597/|title=     Costner eyes 'Dragonfly'     |publisher=Variety|access-date=July 1, 2021}}</ref> Kevin Costner entered negotiations to star in September 2000.<ref name=\"Costner\" />\n\n==Release==\nProduced on a $60 million budget, ''Dragonfly'' made $52 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD on 30 July 2002 by Universal Studios Home Video.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brendan|last=Howard|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3175|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604230211/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3175|title=Universal Lets Fly With Dragonfly|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=4 June 2002|date=27 May 2002|access-date=10 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 7% of 125 critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.65/10.
