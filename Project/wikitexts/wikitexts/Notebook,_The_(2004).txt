The film stars [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Rachel McAdams]] as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s. Their story is read from a notebook in the present day by an elderly man (played by [[James Garner]]), telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident (played by [[Gena Rowlands]], the director Cassavetes' mother).\n\n''The Notebook'' received generally mixed reviews, but performed well at the box office and received a number of award nominations, winning eight [[Teen Choice Awards]], a [[Satellite Award]], and an [[MTV Movie Award]].

He pursues her and they begin a summer romance. One night, Allie goes to Noah's house and meets his father, Frank Calhoun, who immediately likes her. A few days later, Noah is invited to a luncheon at Allie's house by her parents, John and Anne Hamilton, but they are unimpressed with Noah and he doesn't fit in with the other wealthy attendees. That evening, Noah takes Allie to the abandoned Windsor Plantation that he intends to buy and restore for them. While there, Allie asks Noah to make love to her for the first time, but then grows nervous and starts rambling. They are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin with the news that Allie's parents have the police out looking for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, Allie's parents, particularly her mother Anne, make it clear they do not approve of the relationship and forbid her from seeing him. Overhearing Allie's mother's insults, Noah leaves and Allie chases after him. An argument ensues, and Allie breaks up with Noah, but she immediately regrets it. The next morning, Anne announces that the family is returning home to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] that day. Allie tries to find Noah at work but fails, so she asks Fin to tell him she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's home, but finds the gates locked.\n\nNoah writes a letter to Allie every day for a year, but Allie's mother intercepts them. After sending 365 letters with no response, Noah stops writing. He enlists with Fin to fight in [[World War II]], where Fin is [[Battle of the Bulge|killed in battle]]. Allie volunteers as a nurse's aide in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from [[old money|old Southern money]]. After a few years, the two become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents.\n\nNoah returns from the war to find that his father sold their home so Noah could afford to buy the Windsor Plantation. He convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will find her way back to him. While Allie is being fitted for her wedding dress, she spots a photo in a newspaper showing Noah with the house he completed and faints.\n\nAllie is overwhelmed with memories and unresolved feelings for Noah, and asks permission from Lon to take a solo trip before the wedding. She returns to Seabrook to find Noah living in their dream house. The two rekindle and consummate their relationship. Several days later, Allie's mother appears on Noah's doorstep to warn Allie that Lon has followed her to Seabrook. She also reveals that, like her daughter, she once loved a lower-class young man and still thinks about him and how their lives might have been different. She gives Allie the letters Noah wrote. She tells her she hopes Allie makes the right choice. After an emotional argument with Noah, Allie makes the difficult choice to drive back to her hotel and confess her infidelity to Lon. Lon says he still loves her and wants her back, but she decides to return to Noah.\n\nIn the present, the elderly woman listening to the story is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from [[dementia]], and Noah, who now goes by Duke so as not to startle her in her disoriented state, is her husband. During the early stages of her illness, Allie had written a journal detailing their romance and life together so he could read it to her to help her remember, which he does almost every day. One day as he is reading the notebook, she briefly recognizes him. She asks how long they have before she forgets again, and Duke tells her no more than five minutes. They dance to their song, \"[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]\". Allie quickly relapses and panics, and medical personnel must sedate her. Duke has a heart attack and is treated within the nursing home, while Allie is resting in the dementia ward. Upon recovering, and despite not being allowed in, Duke visits Allie's room in the night, and she remembers him again. They kiss, hold hands, and fall asleep. In the morning, the nurse discovers that both died in their sleep, still holding hands.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Noah \"Duke\" Calhoun\n** [[James Garner]] as Old Noah \"Duke\" Calhoun\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton\n** [[Gena Rowlands]] as Old Allison \"Allie\" Calhoun (n\u00e9e Hamilton)\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Anne Hamilton \n* [[James Marsden]] as Lon Hammond, Jr.\n* [[Jamie Anne Allman|Jamie Brown]] as Martha Shaw\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Frank Calhoun\n* [[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]] as John Hamilton\n* [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]] as Fin \n* [[Heather Wahlquist]] as Sara Tuffington\n* [[Ed Grady]] as Harry\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9|Obba Babatunde]] as Bandleader\n\n==Production==\nThe film rights to Nicholas Sparks's novel were acquired by [[New Line Cinema]] in 1996, represented by producer [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/jacobson-goes-to-london-by-the-book-1117433560/| title=Jacobson goes to London by the book| magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=January 13, 1997| access-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> [[Jeremy Leven]] was hired to write the script, which caught the attention of director [[Steven Spielberg]] in 1998,<ref>{{cite news| first=Michael| last=Fleming| url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/spielberg-scans-notebook-1117469500/| title=Spielberg scans 'Notebook'| magazine=Variety| date=April 6, 1998| access-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> who wished to film it with [[Tom Cruise]] as Noah Calhoun.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite news| first=Michael| last=Fleming| url=https://variety.com/2001/film/features/zorro-marks-sequel-1117795799/| title='Zorro' marks sequel| magazine=Variety| date=March 22, 2001| access-date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> Spielberg's commitment to other projects led to [[Jim Sheridan]] becoming attached to direct the following year.
