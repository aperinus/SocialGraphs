In narration, Kid quotes his dad as saying \u201cthe difference between men and boys is the lessons they learn\u201d and adds that his father taught him plenty.\n\nKid practices stunts on the set and meets Tina, while an eager, local biker issues a challenge to Smoke, who accepts. Smoke, casually utilizing \u201ctunnel vision\u201d, wins the race but the challenger loses control when his bike suffers a hydraulics malfunction well over 100 MPH and crashes into a row of parked bikes. Upended, the motorcycle is sent flipping though the air, striking Slick Will and throwing him through a plate storefront window. Both men are instantly killed. At Slick Will's funeral, Smoke leads dozens of bikers from the \"Black Knights\", to personally offer his condolences to Slick Will\u2019s widow Anita and drops a signed Black Knights flag into his grave. Kid is unimpressed with the gesture and triggered.\n\nSix months later, Kid is now a capable rider with his own custom-powered bike. Winning his first \"race\" by dangerously interfering in a challenge between a drunken biker and biker Donny, Kid displays his speed and skill, successfully pulling off stunts hinted at earlier. The crowd loves it, much to the dissatisfaction of Smoke. Kid calls Smoke out to challenge but the latter dismisses this and tells the inexperienced youth to get more experience and clout first.\n\nAt a diner, Kid meets the \u201cdrunk\u201d racer Stuntman where it is revealed that the two are secret [[hustling]] partners and they split the winnings. To cover their tracks, fellow biker Primo suggests that the trio form a bike club and after a bit of persuasion they agree. Kid also tracks down Tina, a tattoo artist and the two start a romance.\n\nKid makes amends to the biker jury consisting of 10 leaders of the most powerful biker gangs. He apologizes for his disrespect, specifically towards their chairman - Smoke and they agree to verify the new club with the trio calling themselves \"Biker Boyz\". At a local fund raising event, the trio becomes a quintet. Smoke courts an old flame and later, is challenged by leader of the Strays and long-time rival Dogg, and the two wager thousands, their lids (helmets) and the title.\n\nThe day of the race, Smoke defeats the aggressive Dogg without issue and afterwards, in late but stunting fashion, the Biker Boyz arrive. Kid trash talks Motherland in an impromptu move to provoke Smoke. Smoke is unamused with Kid\u2019s bid to \"make an entrance\" and the Black Knights exit. Motherland and Kid race until Police descend upon the finish line and the young racer is arrested. The rest of the bikers manage to escape. A lawyer for the Black Knights bails Kid out and Anita confronts him, threatening to evict Kid from her house if he races again.\n\nThe night of the Black Knights annual dance, Kid is challenged by proxy to race Dogg and accepts after a squabble with Tina\u2019s brother and Strays mechanic Wood. Having overheard, Anita finds Smoke before the race and demands that he stop it. Smoke and Anita argue until she relents, telling Smoke that Kid is actually ''his'' son and not Slick Will's. Incredulous, Smoke is moved to act and manages to draw Kid into an altercation. Kid attacks Smoke but the veteran confiscates Kid\u2019s keys and knocks him out cold, successfully averting the race.\n\nRecovering at home, Kid confronts Anita, who confesses decades old truths. Enraged and grief stricken, Kid leaves home and moves in with his girlfriend Tina. Kid elects to go rogue and after gaining more followers for his club, gathers his team, declaring \"we're gonna win more lids than any crew on the set and we're gonna out hustle every crew off the set\" and indicates at reinvention, \"Biker Boyz set their own rules.\"\n\nThe Biker Boyz get their own hangout and begin hustling several races, but when Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is quickly overpowered by the leader of the other club who pulls a gun. Smoke and a group of Black Knights intervene to settle terms and convince the vengeful bikers to stand down. Smoke and Kid have a sit down at the Biker Boyz spot but Kid is more dismissive and angry as ever. Aggravated, Smoke finally agrees to race Kid, under the condition that whoever loses will never race again; but first Smoke has to allow Kid to race Dogg at the next circuit event. Soon thereafter Kid reconciles with Anita.\n\nAt the race track, Kid and his team face the Strays with Smoke and the Black Knights at watch from the stands. Dogg and Kid race down the strip until Dogg does a \u201cbump and run\u201c causing Kid to \u201clay the bike down\u201d into a crash. Although Kid is unhurt, his bike is wrecked. Later that day, Smoke informs Kid that the authorities are closing the track, due to the amount of crashes, but he has managed to rent a farm outside of town, securing their race. Kid agrees to arrive the next day.\n\nLater that night, Kid, Primo, and Stuntman are trying unsuccessfully to fix Kid's bike when the Strays arrive to confront them. Wood confirms that the damage is too severe to mend in time for the race. Dogg concedes that only their bikes are as strong and fast as Smoke\u2019s. As a peace offering, Dogg lends Kid his bike, giving the youth a viable shot at winning.\n\nThe following day, Black Knights and Biker Boyz arrive and line up in opposing formation in the open field, not unlike an old western showdown. Smoke calls for a fair race, with no nitrous oxide system; Kid wants Tina to call the start. Smoke and Kid race on a dirt road behind the farm and Kid adopts Smoke\u2019s \u201ctunnel vision\u201d with the finish line in sight. On course to win, Smoke is suddenly filled with emotions and instead slows down to let his son win - giving way to Kid becoming the new \"King of Cali\".\n\nSmoke, impressed and proud, relinquishes the crown to a humbled and respectful Kid who tells Smoke to keep his helmet. The two men reconcile their differences and enjoy an embrace. Kid watches on as his father rides off into the sunset and in narration repeats Slick Will\u2019s sentiment in full context that \u201cthe difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn\u201d and adds that his father taught him plenty.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Manuel \"Smoke\" Galloway\n* [[Derek Luke]] as Jalil \"Kid\" Galloway, Anita's Son, Tina's Boyfriend and Smoke's Estranged Son\n* [[Orlando Jones]] as \"Soul Train\"\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as \"Motherland\"\n* Nicholas Sheriff as \"Kidd Chaos\"\n* [[Lisa Bonet]] as \"Queenie\"\n* [[Brendan Fehr]] as \"Stuntman\"\n* [[Larenz Tate]] as \"Wood\"\n* [[Terrence Howard|Terrence Dashon Howard]] as \"Chu-Chu\"\n* [[Kid Rock]] as \"Dogg\"\n* [[Rick Gonzalez]] as \"Primo\"\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Tina, Kid's Girlfriend\n* [[Salli Richardson|Salli Richardson-Whitfield]] as \"Half & Half\"\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway]] as Anita Galloway, Kid's Mother and Smoke's Estranged Wife\n* [[Dante Basco]] as \"Philly\"\n* [[Kadeem Hardison]] as T.J\n* [[Dion Basco]] as \"Flip\"\n* [[Tyson Beckford]] as Donny\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as William \"Slick Will\" Galloway, Kid's Stepfather\n\n== Featured motorcycles ==\n* Silver and Magenta [[Suzuki Hayabusa|1999 Suzuki Hayabusa GSX1300R]]: Smoke\n* Yellow and silver [[Suzuki GSX-R1000|2001 Suzuki GSX-R 750]]: Kid\n* Black [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R|2000 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R]]: Dogg\n* Red and silver [[Ducati 996|Ducati 996S]]: Primo\n* Silver [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R|2000 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R]]: Kidd Chaos\n* Orange [[Yamaha YZF-R1|1998 Yamaha R1]]: Chu Chu\n* Silver [[Yamaha YZF-R1|2000 Yamaha R1]]: Stuntman\n* Green [[Suzuki TL1000R|1999 Suzuki TL1000R]]: 1/2 & 1/2\n* 1982 [[Kawasaki KZ1000]]: Soul Train\n* 2001 [[Honda CBR1100XX]]: Motherland\n* [[T-Rex (automobile)]]: T.J.\n\n== Development ==\nBiker Boyz is based loosely on Manuel \"Pokey\" Galloway the president of Valiant Riders of Pasadena, California.\n\nLaurence Fishburne, Derek Luke, Orlando Jones, Djimon Hounsou Nicholas Sheriff, Lisa Bonet, Brendan Fehr, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard, Salli Richardson, Kid Rock, Rick Gonzalez, Meagan Good are all avid bikers in real life.<ref name=\"bonus\">These facts can be verified with the DVD's bonus features.</ref>\n\nThe real \"King Of Cali\" made a cameo appearance in the film, in the scene where Kid is in a meeting with the set.<ref name=\"bonus\" />\n\nSlick Will really doesn't blink as the bike hits him, as Soul Train states.\n\nActual motorcycle clubs were on the set as technical advisors, and performed some of the tricks, stunts, and racing.
