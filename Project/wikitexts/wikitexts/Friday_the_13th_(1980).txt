Cunningham]], written by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], and starring [[Betsy Palmer]], [[Adrienne King]], [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]], [[Laurie Bartram]], [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]], [[Jeannine Taylor]], Robbi Morgan, and [[Kevin Bacon]]. Its plot follows a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while attempting to re-open an abandoned [[summer camp]].\n\nPrompted by the success of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), director Cunningham put out an advertisement to sell the film in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay. After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in [[New Jersey]] in the summer of 1979, on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with [[Paramount Pictures]] acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] secured international distribution rights.\n\nReleased on May 9, 1980, ''Friday the 13th'' was a major box office success, grossing $59.8 million worldwide. Critical response was divided, with some praising the film's cinematography and score, while numerous others derided it for its depiction of graphic violence. Aside from being the first [[independent film]] of its kind to secure distribution in the U.S. by a major studio, its box office success led to [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|a long series of sequels]], [[Freddy vs. Jason|a crossover]] with the  [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]], and [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|a 2009 series reboot]]. A direct sequel, ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', was released one year later.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes sneak inside a storage cabin to have sex, where an unseen assailant murders them. In the present day, 1979, camp counselor Annie Phillips is driven halfway to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake by Enos, a truck driver, despite warnings from elderly Crazy Ralph, and disgusted reactions from the townspeople. While driving, Enos warns Annie about the camp's troubled past, beginning when a young boy drowned in Crystal Lake in 1957. After being dropped off, she hitches another ride from an unseen person, who drives her past the camp. When Annie escapes the vehicle, the killer chases her into the woods and slashes her throat.\n\nAt the camp, counselors Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda, and [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice]], along with owner Steve Christy, refurbish the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Ned sees someone walk into a cabin and follows. While Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's bunk beds, they are unaware of Ned's body above them, his throat having been slit. When Marcie leaves to use the bathroom, Jack's throat is pierced with an arrow from beneath the bed. The killer follows Marcie into the bathroom and drives an axe into her face. When Brenda turns in for the night, she hears a little boy's voice calling for help and ventures outside to the archery range, where the lights turn on. Brenda screams. Later, Steve returns and recognizes the unseen killer, who stabs him to death.\n\nWorried by their friends' disappearances, Alice and Bill leave the main cabin to investigate. They find the axe in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and Ned's truck inoperable. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator. Alice heads out to look for him and finds his body pinned with arrows to the generator room's door. She flees to the main cabin to hide, only to be traumatized further when Brenda's body is thrown through the window. Soon after, Alice sees a vehicle pull up and rushes outside, thinking it is Steve. Instead, she is greeted by [[Pamela Voorhees|Mrs. Voorhees]], a middle-aged woman who claims to be an old friend of Steve and his family.\n\nShe reveals that her son, [[Jason Voorhees|Jason]], was the young boy who drowned in 1957, blaming his death on neglect by the counselors because they were having sex instead. Revealing herself as the killer, she attempts to kill Alice, but Alice knocks her unconscious. At the shore, Mrs. Voorhees tries to kill Alice again with a machete, but Alice gains the advantage and decapitates her. Exhausted, Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe which floats out on Crystal Lake. Suddenly, Jason's decomposing corpse attacks her, at which point she awakens in a hospital surrounded by a police sergeant and medical staff who are tending to her. When Alice asks about Jason, the sergeant says there was no sign of any boy. She says, \"Then he's still there,\" as the lake is shown with ripples in the water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Betsy Palmer]] as [[Pamela Voorhees|Mrs. Pamela Voorhees]]\n* [[Adrienne King]] as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice]]\n* [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]] as Bill\n* [[Jeannine Taylor]] as Marcie\n* [[Laurie Bartram]] as Brenda\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jack\n* [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]] as Ned\n* Robbi Morgan as Annie\n* Peter Brouwer as Steve Christy \n* [[Rex Everhart]] as Enos, The Truck Driver\n* [[Ronn Carroll]] as Sgt.

Cunningham took out this advertisement in ''Variety'' magazine]]\n''Friday the 13th'' was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], who had previously worked with filmmaker [[Wes Craven]] on the film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Cunningham, inspired by [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'',{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be shocking, visually stunning and \"[make] you jump out of your seat.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} Wanting to distance himself from ''The Last House on the Left'', Cunningham wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be more of a \"roller-coaster ride.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe original screenplay was tentatively titled ''A Long Night at Camp Blood''.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title ''Friday the 13th'', after which Miller began redeveloping.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' using the ''Friday the 13th'' title.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the ''Friday the 13th'' logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=15\u201316}} In the end, Cunningham believed there were \"no problems\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, \"There was a movie before ours called ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan''. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}}\n\nThe screenplay was completed in mid-1979{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], who later went on to write for several television [[soap opera]]s, including ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]''; at the time, Miller was living in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], near Cunningham, and the two had begun collaborating on potential film projects.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. \"I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted\u2014a mother who would have killed for her kids.\"<ref name=miller/> Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. \"Jason was dead from the very beginning.

Cunningham admits that he was not looking for \"great actors,\" but anyone that was likable, and appeared to be a responsible camp counselor.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=21\u201328}} The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need to look good, read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Laurie Bartram]], Peter Brouwer, and [[Adrienne King]], who had previously appeared on [[soap operas]].{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} The role of [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. The producers originally wanted [[Sally Field]] for the role of Alice, but realized that they could not afford an established high-profile actress and went for unknowns instead. According to Adrienne King. \"originally, [the producers] were looking really hard for a name actress to play Alice. They finally realized that even if they could find somebody like that who was willing to do it, they wouldn't be able to afford her, so they decided to go with new talent instead.\"<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Fangoria]] | issue=83 | title=The Women of Crystal Lake Part One | author=Marc Shapiro | date=June 1989 | pages=18\u201321}}</ref> King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes's office, and Cunningham felt she embodied the qualities of Alice.{{sfn|Norman|2014|p=84}} After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I didn't even really think of this movie as a horror film.

Kevin Bacon, [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]] and Jeannine Taylor, who had known each other prior to the film, were cast as Jack, Ned, and Marcie respectively. It is Bacon and Nelson's contention that, because the three already knew each other, they already had the specific chemistry the casting director was looking for in the roles of Jack, Ned, and Marcie.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Taylor has stated that Hughes and Moss were highly regarded while she was an actress, so when they offered her an audition she felt that, whatever the part, it would \"be a good opportunity.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n\n''Friday the 13th'' was Nelson's first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition, the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which, Nelson acknowledges, made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, \"It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular.{{Sfn|Grove|2005|pages= 36\u201339}} Ned is believed to have given birth to the \"practical joker victim\" of horror films.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}} According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', or [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' before that. He served as a model for the slasher films that would follow ''Friday the 13th''.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I went in to audition for [Moss and Hughes] for something else.

[[Rex Everhart]], who portrayed Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, so she had to either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis\u2014Savini's assistant\u2014who would sit in the truck with her.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on ''Friday the 13th''. After recently being written off the show ''[[Love of Life]]'', Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an [[assistant director]] for ''Friday the 13th'', Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}}\n\n[[Estelle Parsons]] was initially asked to portray the film's killer, Mrs. Voorhees, but declined with her agent citing that the film was too violent, and did not know what kind of actress would play such a part. [[Shelley Winters]] was also offered the part, but turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/11/22/friday-the-13th-kevin-bacon/|title = 'On Location in Blairstown: The Making of Friday the 13th': Author Q&A|website = [[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Hughes and Moss sent a copy of the script to Betsy Palmer, in hopes that she would accept the part. Palmer could not understand why someone would want her for a part in a horror film, as she had previously starred in films such as ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'', ''The Angry Man'', and ''[[The Tin Star]]''. Palmer only agreed to play the role because she needed to buy a new car, even when she believed the film to \"be a piece of shit.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Stavrakis subbed for Betsy Palmer as well, which involved Morgan's character being chased through the woods by Mrs. Voorhees, although the audience only sees a pair of legs running after Morgan. Palmer had just arrived in town when those scenes were about to be filmed, and was not in the physical shape necessary to chase Morgan around the woods. Morgan's training as an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] assisted her in these scenes, as her character was required to leap out of a moving jeep when she discovers that Mrs. Voorhees does not intend to take her to the camp.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} Betsy Palmer explains how she developed the character of Mrs. Voorhees:\n\n{{blockquote|Being an actress who uses the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavsky method]], I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela ... I began with a class ring that I remember reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex\u2014which is very bad of course\u2014and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having ... babies out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but he turned out to be a very strange boy. [She took] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=49\u201350}}}}\n\nCunningham wanted to make the Mrs. Voorhees character \"terrifying\", and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act \"over the top.\" There was also the fear that Palmer's past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=52}} Palmer was paid $1000 per day for her ten days on set.<ref name=freaky>{{cite news|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|pages=D\u20131, {{url|https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938843/pittsburgh_postgazette/|D-5}}|author=Vancheri, Barbara|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|date=February 13, 2009|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938812/pittsburgh_postgazette/|title=Freaky Friday|access-date=August 19, 2018|archive-date=August 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182217/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938812/pittsburgh_postgazette/|url-status=live}}</ref> Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham's ''Manny's Orphans'', failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees. According to Lehman, he went in very intense and afterward Cunningham told him he was perfect for the part.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} In addition to the main cast, [[Walt Gorney]] came on as \"Crazy Ralph\", the town's [[Oracle|soothsayer]]. The character of Crazy Ralph was meant to establish two functions: foreshadow the events to come, and insinuate that he could actually be the murderer. Cunningham has stated that he was apprehensive about including the character, and is not sure if he accomplished his goal of creating a new suspect.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Boat at NoBeBoSco 07162018.jpg|thumb|[[Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco]]]]\nThe film was shot in and around the townships of [[Hardwick, New Jersey|Hardwick]], [[Blairstown, New Jersey|Blairstown]], and [[Hope Township, New Jersey|Hope]], in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], [[New Jersey]] in September 1979.

He came up with the sound \"ki ki ki, ma ma ma\" from the final reel when Mrs. Voorhees arrives and is reciting \"Kill her, mommy!\" The \"ki\" comes from \"kill\", and the \"ma\" from \"mommy\". To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words \"harshly, distinctly and rhythmically into a microphone\" and ran them into an echo reverberation machine.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini finished the original score after a couple of weeks, and then recorded the score in a friend's basement.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=39}} Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as \"iconographic\".

Clover]] in her book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]''. Clover notes the revelation of Pamela Voorhees as the killer as \"the most dramatic case of pulling out the gender rug\" in horror film history.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}} Commenting on the first-person point-of-view shots from the killer, Clover writes: \"'We' [the audience] stalk and kill a number of teenagers over the course of an hour of movie time without even knowing who 'we' are; we are invited, by conventional expectation and by glimpses of 'our' own bodily parts{{em dash}}a heavily booted foot, a roughly gloved hand{{em dash}}to suppose that 'we' are male, but 'we' are revealed, at the film's end, as a woman.\"{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}}\n\nOn the killer's identity, Dimare has noted:\n\n{{blockquote|Because Cunningham avoids revealing anything about the psychotic killer beyond the fact that the figure is dressed in men's gloves and boots, the audience assumes the slayer is a man... &nbsp; Cunningham sustains the eerie indeterminacy of the killer's age, social status, and gender deep into his film.
