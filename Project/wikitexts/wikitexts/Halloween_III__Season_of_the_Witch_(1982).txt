It is the first film to be written and directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]]. [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]], the creators of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', return as producers. ''Halloween III'' is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. After the film's disappointing reception and box office performance, Michael Myers was brought back six years later in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]''.\n\nThe film departs from the [[Slasher film|slasher genre]] of the other installments, instead featuring a \"[[witchcraft]]\" theme with [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] aspects. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the ''Halloween'' series could have been an [[anthology series]] of films that centered around [[Halloween|Halloween night]], with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that ''Season of the Witch'' was meant to be the first.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\nAs with the series' other films, suspense and tension are key themes, exploring violence against young children. On a budget of $2.5 million, ''Halloween III'' made a profit by grossing $14.4 million at the [[box office]] in the US,<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=halloween3.htm|title=Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=September 10, 2017}}</ref> but it was also the poorest performing film in the ''Halloween'' series at the time.<ref name=\"boxofficemojoseries\"/> Most critics gave the film negative reviews.

He collapses at the shop of Walter Jones, who calls for help. Harry is taken to a hospital and placed in the care of Dr. Daniel Challis, an alcoholic doctor who has a strained relationship with his ex-wife and two children. Later that night, Harry is murdered by another suited man, who [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his car. After identifying his body, Harry's daughter Ellie meets Daniel at a bar and reveals that she has discovered suspicious events surrounding Harry's death. To investigate, they travel to the Silver Shamrock factory in Santa Mira, California, where the Halloween masks are made. Upon their arrival, they check into a [[motel]], the manager of which reveals that Conal Cochran and his factory, Silver Shamrock Novelties, producer of the popular Halloween masks, are the source of the town's prosperity. While checking in, Daniel learns that Harry was also a recent motel guest.\n\nMarge Guttman, another motel customer, discovers a [[microchip]] on the back of the medallion of one of the masks. The medallion emits a deadly energy beam into her mouth as she picks at it curiously with a hairpin. Her face is left mutilated, and an insect crawls out of her mouth. Shortly after, men in lab coats take Marge's body away in a Silver Shamrock van. Daniel overhears the factory technicians telling Cochran that it was a \"misfire.\" While Daniel and Ellie tour the factory the following morning, Ellie finds her father's car, guarded by more men in suits who stop her from getting closer to it. They flee and call the authorities, but Daniel cannot reach anyone outside of town by phone. Ellie is kidnapped and taken to the factory; Daniel follows and is captured by the men in suits, revealed to be [[androids]] Cochran created.\n\nCochran takes Daniel to the \"final processing\" control room and reveals his plan: the microchips on each mask contain a fragment of a piece of [[Stonehenge]] he stole. Upon viewing the \"Big Giveaway\" commercial, the microchips on the masks will activate, killing whoever is wearing them with fatal brain damage and causing a swarm of insects and snakes to emanate from their bodies, also killing anyone nearby. Meanwhile, Teddy, the hospital assistant coroner Daniel entrusted to investigate the car explosion, is murdered by an android.\n\nCochran locks Daniel in a room with a mask on and explains his intention to resurrect ancient [[pagan]] rituals of sacrificing children during the age of [[Samhain]] from his native [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] lands. Daniel escapes his bonds and rescues Ellie. He sneaks into the control room, activates the commercial on the screens, and pours a box of the medallions from a ceiling rafter, killing everyone. Then Cochran is also killed by the Stonehenge rune, leading to a massive fire that destroys the factory. As they flee, Daniel is attacked by Ellie, revealed to be an android duplicate. The struggle leads to a car crash, and he destroys the duplicate Ellie with a tire iron. Daniel flees on foot to Walter's shop, where he frantically calls the various television networks to convince them to terminate the broadcast. Two channels abort, but a third station fails to do so, with Daniel screaming into the telephone, pleading with them to make it stop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n{{Main|List of Halloween (film series) characters}}\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Dr. Dan Challis\n* [[Stacey Nelkin]] as Ellie Grimbridge\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Conal Cochran\n* [[Michael Currie (actor)|Michael Currie]] as Rafferty\n* [[Ralph Strait]] as Buddy Kupfer\n* Jadeen Barbor as Betty Kupfer\n* Brad Schacter as Little Buddy\n* [[Garn Stephens]] as Marge Guttman\n* [[Nancy Kyes]] as Linda Challis\n* [[Jonathan Terry]] as Starker\n* Al Berry as Harry Grimbridge\n* Wendy Wessberg as Teddy\n* Essex Smith as Walter Jones\n* [[Maidie Norman]] as Nurse Agnes\n}}\n\n[[Dick Warlock]], who played Michael Myers in ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', played the android Assassin.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:HalloweenIII1 masks.jpg|upright|thumb|Skeleton and witch masks created by [[Don Post]], worn by Dan Challis's ([[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]]) children.]]\nWhen approached about creating a third ''Halloween'' film, original ''Halloween'' writers [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]] were reluctant to pledge commitment.

It's a fun movie with a lot of thrills in it; not a lot of random gratuitous gore.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Many of the special effects were meant to emphasize the theme of the [[practical joke]] that peppers the plot. ''New York Times'' film critic [[Vincent Canby]] notes, \"The movie features a lot of carefully executed, comically horrible special effects . ... \" Canby stood as one of the few critics of the time to praise Wallace's directing: \"Mr. Wallace clearly has a fondness for the clich\u00e9s he is parodying and he does it with style.\"<ref name=\"Canbyreview\">[[Vincent Canby]], \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/movies/haloween-iii-plotting-a-joke.html Film: 'Halloween III,' Plotting a Joke]\", ''The New York Times'', 22 October 1982, p.

This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a [[Timecode|time coded]] video tape and synchronized to a 24 track [[Audio mastering|master audio recorder]]; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has \"instant gratification\", allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Vincent Canby]] struggled to apply a definite label to the film's content. He remarks, \"''Halloween III'' manages the not easy feat of being anti-children, [[anti-capitalism]], anti-television and [[anti-Irish]] all at the same time.\" On the other hand, he says that the film \"is probably as good as any cheerful ghoul could ask for.\"<ref name=\"Canbyreview\"/> Other critics were far more decisive in their assessments. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that the film was \"a low-rent thriller from the first frame. This is one of those [[Identikit]] movies, assembled out of familiar parts from other, better movies.\" However, he did praise Stacey Nelkin's performance.<ref name=\"Ebertreview\"/> ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine called the film a \"hopelessly jumbled mess\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Mayo|title=Hack rewrite turns Kneale's treat into dreary chaos.

Why?\"<ref name=\"Ebertreview\" />\n\nTom Milne of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' offered a more positive review, calling the title \"a bit of a cheat, since the indestructible psycho of the first two films plays no part here.\" Unlike other critics, Milne thought the new plot was refreshing: \"With the possibilities of the characters [of the previous ''Halloween'' films] well and truly exhausted, ''Season of the Witch'' turns more profitably to a marvellously ingenious Nigel Kneale tale of a toymaker and his fiendish plan to restore Halloween to its witch cult origins.\" Although Milne was unhappy that Kneale's original script was reduced to \"a bit of a mess\", he still believed the end result was \"hugely enjoyable\".<ref>Tom Milne, review of ''Halloween III: Season of the Witch'', ''Time Out'', reprinted in 2nd ed., 1991, p. 277.</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds a 48% approval rating and an average rating of 5.2/10, based on 33 reviews.

Riveria's poster art featured a demonic face descending on three [[trick-or-treat]]ers. His artwork was later featured on the cover of ''Fangoria'' in October 1982. The stylized face on the theatrical poster is actually a distorted image of the witch mask which appears in the film.  The image of the trick-or-treaters is similar to a shot in the movie that shows children in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] walking in silhouette with a red sunset in the background.\n\n===Merchandising===\nAs part of a [[merchandising]] campaign, the producers requested [[Don Post]] to mass-produce the skull, witch, and jack-o'-lantern masks.<ref name=\"harmetz\"/> Producers had given exclusive merchandising rights to Post as part of his contract for working on the film, and Post Studios had already successfully marketed tie-in masks for the classic [[Universal Monsters]], ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). Post used the original [[Molding (process)|mold]]s for the masks in the film to mass-produce masks for retail sale. He speculated, \"Because the masks are so significant to the movie, they could become a cult item, with fans wanting to wear them when they go to see the movie.\" Post also gave mask-making demonstrations for a [[Universal Parks & Resorts|Universal Studio]] tour in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. The masks retailed for $25 when they finally appeared in stores.
