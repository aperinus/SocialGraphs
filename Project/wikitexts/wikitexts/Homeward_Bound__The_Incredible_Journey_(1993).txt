Directed by [[Duwayne Dunham]], it was released on February 3, 1993. It grossed $57 million worldwide and was followed in 1996 by ''[[Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco]]''. This film is dedicated to producer [[Franklin R. Levy]], who died during production of the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, film summaries are not to exceed 700 words. This one is currently at 645.-->\nChance, a selfish and free-spirited [[American Bulldog]] and the narrator of the film, explains that he is the pet of Jamie Burnford, but expresses no interest in his owner or being part of a family. He shares his home with Shadow, a wise old [[Golden Retriever]] owned by Jamie's brother Peter, and Sassy, a pampered [[Himalayan cat]] owned by Peter and Jamie's sister Hope. That morning, the children's mother, Laura Burnford, marries Bob Seaver, and Chance causes trouble by devouring the wedding cake in front of all the guests.\n\nShortly after the wedding, the family has to temporarily move to [[San Francisco]] because Bob must relocate there for his job. They leave the pets at a ranch belonging to Kate, Laura's college friend. Shadow and Sassy miss their owners immediately, but Chance sees it as an opportunity to relax and be free. Later in the week, Kate goes on a [[cattle drive]], leaving the animals to be looked after by her neighbor Frank. However, half of her message to him is lost, leading him to believe that she has taken them along, leaving the animals alone. Unsure about the disappearance of their host, the animals fear they have been abandoned. Shadow, refusing to believe that his boy would leave him, decides to make his way home. Not wanting to be left alone on the ranch, Chance and Sassy decide to accompany Shadow on his journey.\n\nThey head into the rocky, mountainous wilderness of the [[Sierra Nevada]] with Shadow leading. After a night spent in fear of the woodland noises, the group stops to catch breakfast at a river. However, two [[American black bear|black bear cubs]] interrupt Chance and a large [[Grizzly bear|brown bear]] causes the group to retreat. At another river, Sassy refuses to swim across to follow the dogs and instead tries to cross via a wooden path further downstream; halfway across, the wood breaks and she falls into the river. Shadow tries to save her, but she goes over a waterfall to her apparent death. Guilt-ridden, Shadow and Chance go on without her. Unknown to them, Sassy survives and is later found on the riverbank by an old man named Quentin, who nurses her back to health.\n\nOver the next two days, Shadow and Chance try unsuccessfully to catch food and encounter a [[Cougar|mountain lion]], which chases them to the edge of a cliff. Shadow gets an idea to use rocks positioned like a seesaw as a way to outsmart the mountain lion. While Shadow acts as bait, Chance pounces onto the end of the rock and sends the mountain lion over the cliff and into a river. Sassy hears the dogs barking in celebration and follows the sound to rejoin them.\n\nThe animals continue on their way, but Chance begins pestering a [[porcupine]], ending up with a load of quills in his muzzle. The animals then encounter a little girl named Molly, who is lost in the woods. Loyalty instinct takes over and they stand guard over her during the night. In the morning, Shadow finds a rescue party and leads them back to the girl. They recognize the animals from a missing pets flyer and take them to the local [[animal shelter]], but Chance mistakes it for an [[animal pound]] and the trio panic. As the medical staff remove the quills from Chance's muzzle, Sassy sneaks in and frees Shadow. Together, they retrieve Chance and escape the shelter, unaware that their owners are on their way to get them.\n\nFinally reaching their hometown, the animals cross through a train yard, where Shadow falls into a muddy pit and injures his leg. Despondent, he tells Chance and Sassy to go on without him, and when Chance argues passionately, tells the younger dog he's learned all he needs; \"Now all you have to learn is how to say goodbye.\" Heartbroken, Chance insists he won't let him give up. Near dusk, Chance and Sassy finally make it home and are happily reunited with their owners. Shadow initially fails to appear, but eventually he limps into view and happily comes running home at the sight of Peter. Chance narrates how it was Shadow's belief that brought them home and how the years seemed to lift off of him, making him a puppy again as he reunited with his boy. The film ends with Chance musing about how he truly feels \"home\" with his family, before happily running into the house at the smell of food.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Michael J.
