The film is based on the life of American [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]]/[[Neoexpressionism|neo expressionist]] artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. It is the first film about an American painter written and directed by another artist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Weinreich|first=Regina|date=1996-08-11|title=Schnabel Becomes a Director To Film the Life of Basquiat|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/11/nyregion/schnabel-becomes-a-director-to-film-the-life-of-basquiat.html|access-date=2021-12-08|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] portrays Basquiat, a [[Brooklyn]]-born artist who used his [[graffiti]] roots as a foundation to create [[collage]]-style paintings on canvas. [[David Bowie]] plays Basquiat's friend and mentor, pop artist [[Andy Warhol]]. Additional cast members include [[Gary Oldman]] as a thinly disguised Schnabel, [[Michael Wincott]] as the poet and art critic [[Rene Ricard]], [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bruno Bischofberger]], [[Parker Posey]] as gallery owner [[Mary Boone]], [[Christopher Walken]] as a devious, intrusive journalist, [[Willem Dafoe]] as a supportive artist who\u2019s making ends meet as an electrician, and [[Claire Forlani]], [[Courtney Love]], [[Tatum O'Neal]], and [[Benicio del Toro]] in supporting roles as \"composite characters\".\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film is a lightly fictionalized account of Basquiat's life. A struggling artist living in a cardboard box in [[Tompkins Square Park]] works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association with [[Andy Warhol]], the art dealer [[Bruno Bischofberger]], poet and critic [[Ren\u00e9 Ricard]], and fellow artist Albert Milo.\n\nAlongside the development of his artistic career, the film follows Basquiat's tumultuous relationship with Gina, a fellow aspiring artist he meets while she is working as a waitress at the diner he frequents with his friend Benny. Their romance is affected by Basquiat's affair with \"Big Pink\", a woman he picks up on the street,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/basquiat | title=Basquiat - Reelviews Movie Reviews | work=James Berardinelli | publisher=Reelviews | access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> and his habitual abuse of [[heroin]]. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol, and his drug use. The film ends with an [[intertitle]] stating that Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12, 1988, at the age of 27.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]\n* [[David Bowie]] as [[Andy Warhol]]\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Benny Dalmau\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Bruno Bischofberger]]\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Albert Milo\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as [[Ren\u00e9 Ricard]]\n* [[Claire Forlani]] as Gina Cardinale\n* [[Parker Posey]] as [[Mary Boone]]\n* [[Courtney Love]] as Big Pink\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Annina Nosei]]\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as [[Henry Geldzahler]]\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Cynthia Kruger\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as The Interviewer\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as the Electrician\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Thug\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nJulian Schnabel had given [[seed money]] to another film that was being developed about Jean-Michel Basquiat, but when he read an early script that he believed misrepresented Andy Warhol, he decided to make the film himself.<ref name=\":0\" /> Schnabel said, <nowiki>''</nowiki>In the film, I wanted to make a requiem for Jean and Andy ...

Schnabel also added [[cameo appearance]]s by his mother, father, and daughter (as Milo's family). Schnabel appeared as an extra as a waiter.\n\n''Basquiat'' was the first commercial feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said:\n<blockquote>\n\"I know what it's like to be attacked as an artist. I know what it's like to be judged as an artist. I know what it's like to arrive as an artist and have fame and notoriety. I know what it's like to be accused of things that you never said or did. I know what it's like to be described as a piece of hype. I know what it's like to be appreciated as well as degraded.\"<ref>\"Basquiat\" Interview. Ingrid Sischy.

Basquiat's estate denied permission for his work to be used in the film. Schnabel and his studio assistant Greg Bogin created paintings \"in the style of\" Basquiat for the film.<ref>Charlie Rose interview with Julian Schnabel and David Bowie on the movie ''Basquiat''.

[...] Julian made him out to be too docile and too much of a victim and too passive and not as dangerous as he really was. It's about containing Basquiat. It's about aggrandizing himself through Basquiat's memory.\"<ref>[[Phoebe Hoban]]. ''Basquiat: A Quick Killing in the Art World'' (second edition). Penguin Books. New York, 2004.</ref>\n\nComparing Bowie's Warhol to earlier portrayals, [[Paul Morrissey]] (who directed many Warhol films) said \"Bowie was the best by far. You come away from ''Basquiat'' thinking Andy was comical and amusing, not a pretentious, phony piece of shit, which is how others show him.\" He also noted that \"Bowie at least knew Andy. They went to the same parties.\" Bowie was able to borrow Warhol's actual wig, glasses and jacket from the [[Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh for the film. Writer [[Bob Colacello]], who edited Warhol's [[Interview magazine|''Interview'' magazine]] in the 70's and early 80's, said \"[[Crispin Glover|[Crispin] Glover]] walked the most like [the real] Andy, [[Jared Harris|[Jared] Harris]] talked the most like Andy, and Bowie looked the most like Andy.

In ''Art in America'', the art critic Brooks Adams wrote:\n<blockquote>\n''Basquiat'' can be seen as a huge, lurking self-portrait of the artist-Schnabel, not Basquiat. So laden is the film with the innumerable coincidences of Basquiat and Schnabel's enthusiasms (among others, for pajamas and surfing) that the movie should be more appropriately called My Basquiat... To a remarkable degree, the movie succeeds, by dint of its authorial slant, in popularizing the myth of Basquiat as a young, gorgeous, doomed, yet ultimately transcendent black male artist, even as it extends and reinflates the myth of Schnabel as a protean, Picassoid white male painter... Yet for all one's apprehension about the very idea of Schnabel making such a film, Basquiat turns out to be a surprisingly good movie...It is also an art work.<ref>Brooks Adams. \"Basquiat. - movie reviews\" ''Art in America'', Sept, 1996.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Music==\nThe following songs are in order of their appearance in the film.\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* \"[[Fairytale of New York]]\" &ndash; [[The Pogues]]\n* \"Public Image\" &ndash; [[Public Image Ltd]].\n* \"Girlfriend\" &ndash; [[The Modern Lovers]]\n* \"Suicide Mode\" &ndash; Nicholas Marion Taylor\n* \"Suicide Hotline Mode\" &ndash; Nicholas Marion Taylor\n* \"I'm Not in Love\" &ndash; [[Toadies]]\n* \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\" &ndash; [[Iggy Pop]]\n* \"[[The Nearness of You]]\" &ndash; [[Keith Richards]]\n* \"[[Waiting on a Friend]]\" &ndash; [[The Rolling Stones]]\n* \"Pixote Theme\" &ndash; Electro Band\n* \"[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]\" &ndash; [[Them (band)|Them]]\n* \"You Can't Be Funky (If You Haven't Got Soul)\" &ndash; [[Bush Tetras]]\n* \"[[Flamenco Sketches]]\" &ndash; [[Miles Davis]]\n* \"[[Ko-Ko]]\" &ndash; [[Charlie Parker]]\n* \"[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)|White Lines]]\" &ndash; [[Melle Mel]] (as GrandMaster Flash Melle Mel)\n* \"[[Beast of Burden (song)|Beast of Burden]]\" &ndash; The Rolling Stones\n* \"[[Rise (Public Image Ltd song)|Rise]]\" &ndash; [[Tripping Daisy]]\n* \"[[Is That All There Is?]]\" &ndash; [[Peggy Lee]]\n* \"Paris Je T'aime (Paris, Stay the Same)\" &ndash; David McDermott\n* \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" &ndash; [[Charlie Parker]]\n* \"Who Are You This Time\" &ndash; [[Tom Waits]]\n* \"India\" &ndash; [[The Psychedelic Furs]]\n* \"D'amor sull'ali rosee\" (''[[Il trovatore]]'', Act 4 Sc. 1) &ndash; [[Renata Tebaldi]]\n* \"[[Tom Traubert's Blues]] (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)\" &ndash; Tom Waits\n* \"[[A Small Plot of Land]]\" &ndash; [[David Bowie]]\n* ''[[Symphony No. 3 (G\u00f3recki)|Symphony No. 3, Opus 36 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs)]]'' &ndash; [[Henryk G\u00f3recki]] ([[London Sinfonietta]])\n* \"[[Summer in Siam]]\" &ndash; [[The Pogues]]\n* \"She Is Dancing\" &ndash; Brian Kelly\n* \"[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]\" &ndash; [[John Cale]]\n* \"This Is the Last Song I'll Ever Sing\" &ndash; [[Gavin Friday]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Postmodernist film]]\n* [[Downtown 81]]\n*''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' - another Warhol-related film from the same year\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0115632|Basquiat}}\n* {{Mojo title|basquiat|Basquiat}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|basquiat|Basquiat}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Basquiat}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GsWZyvtX5tU Official trailer]\n\n{{Julian Schnabel|state=expanded}}{{Jean-Michel Basquiat}}{{Andy Warhol}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basquiat}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:1996 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1996 drama films]]\n[[Category:1996 independent films]]\n[[Category:1996 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about painters]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of 20th-century painters]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Andy Warhol]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Julian Schnabel]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jon Kilik]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Cale]]\n[[Category:Films set in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Jean-Michel Basquiat]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related drama films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
