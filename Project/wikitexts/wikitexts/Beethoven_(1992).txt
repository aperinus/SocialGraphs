It is the first installment of the [[Beethoven (film series)|''Beethoven'' film series]].\n\nThe film was written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] (under the [[pseudonym]] [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]]) and [[Amy Holden Jones]]. Its story centers on a [[St. Bernard dog]] named after the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|German composer of the same name]] and owned by the Newton family. It costars [[Nicholle Tom]] as Ryce Newton, [[Christopher Castile]] as Ted Newton, [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emily Newton, [[Stanley Tucci]] as Vernon, [[Oliver Platt]] as Harvey, and [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Dr. Herman Varnick.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of puppies are stolen from a pet store by two thieves. A [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] puppy escapes and sneaks into the Newton family's home. The workaholic father, George, does not want the responsibility of owning a dog, but his wife, Alice, and their children, Ryce, Ted, and Emily, convince him. They give him the name \u201cBeethoven\u201d when Emily plays a portion of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] on the piano and he barks along to it.\n\nBeethoven grows into a fully grown, adult dog and helps Ryce, Ted, and Emily overcome their problems: he helps Ryce talk to a boy she has a crush on, scares off bullies for Ted, and saves Emily's life when she falls into an irresponsible babysitter's [[swimming pool]]. George, jealous of the affection Beethoven receives, feels neglected as his family fawns over him. His antics ruin a [[barbecue]] he is hosting for Brad and Brie Wilson, unpleasant [[venture capital]]ists looking to invest and swindle him out of his [[air freshener|car air freshener]] firm.\n\nThe Newtons take Beethoven to a [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]] named Dr. Herman Varnick for a routine medical examination and [[immunization]]s. They are unaware that he is involved in [[medical ethics|unethical]] and deadly animal experiments. He tells George of a supposed mental instability among St. Bernards making them potentially dangerous to humans and advises him to watch Beethoven closely for any sign of viciousness. He actually requires large-skulled dogs such as St. Bernards for an ammunition test.\n\nDr. Varnick visits the Newton home under the guise of doing a follow-up exam on Beethoven. He puts fake blood on his arm, cuts and tears his shirt sleeve, and hits Beethoven until he leaps on him. He pretends to be in agony, warning George that Beethoven may be turning aggressive and must be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] or he will have no choice but to press charges. Emily, who saw Dr. Varnick hit him, protests that the attack was fake, but George, fearing for his family's safety, reluctantly takes him to Dr. Varnick's office. It is on the way there that George discovers his own affections for him: he remembers his father had to take their dog to the vet to be euthanized and he never forgave him for it. He fears that his family will hate him now for taking Beethoven to be euthanized. When he returns home with the empty leash and collar, his family leaves the dinner table rather than remain with him, proving his fears true.\n\nAfter being upset, the Newtons go to Dr. Varnick's office, but he tells them that Beethoven has already been euthanized. However, George remembers that Dr. Varnick's receptionist told him that Beethoven would not be euthanized until the next day. George then notices that Dr. Varnick has no bite marks on his arm and assaults him. The Newtons follow him to his [[warehouse]]. Beethoven breaks free but is recaptured by Dr. Varnick's two associates, Harvey and Vernon, while Alice calls the [[police]]. George crashes through the [[skylight]] just as Dr. Varnick prepares to shoot Beethoven. Before he can, however, a captive [[Jack Russell Terrier]] bites him in the crotch, causing him to fire a shot in the air. After hearing it, Ted drives the car through the door and runs it into a cart, launching numerous [[syringes]] into Dr. Varnick and sedating him. As the Newtons reunite with Beethoven and free all the captive dogs, they notice Harvey and Vernon trying to escape and send the dogs after them. They escape into a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]], only to be attacked by a pack of [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]]s guarding it.\n\nDr. Varnick, Harvey, and Vernon are arrested for [[Cruelty to animals|animal abuse]]. The Newtons are praised as heroes by the news and George takes a new liking to Beethoven. Ryce also gets a phone call from her crush. The Newtons then go to sleep, saying good night to Beethoven and all of the dogs they rescued, who are sleeping in the master bedroom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as George Newton\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Alice Newton\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Dr. Herman Varnick\n* [[Nicholle Tom]] as Ryce Newton\n* [[Christopher Castile]] as Ted Newton\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emily Newton\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Harvey\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Vernon\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Brad Wilson\n* [[Patricia Heaton]] as Brie Wilson\n* [[Laurel Cronin]] as Devonia Peet\n* Nancy Fish as Miss Grundel\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Student\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Ammo Gun Salesman\n\n==Production==\nThe dogs featured in the film were owned and trained by [[Eleanor Keaton]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Galloway |first=Doug |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/eleanor-norris-keaton-1117882475/ |title=Eleanor Norris Keaton |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  |date=October 21, 1998 |access-date= February 15, 2018}}</ref> Beethoven is played by canine actor Chris, who had 12 doubles.<ref name=\"latimes-wilmington\" /> Principal photography began on May 1, 1991, in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nAlthough the film received mixed reviews from critics, it received acclaim by audiences.
