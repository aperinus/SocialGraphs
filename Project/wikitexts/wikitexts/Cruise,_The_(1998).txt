It was the debut film of [[Bennett Miller]], who became prominent after directing ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' (2005). The film records the worldview and personality of [[Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch]], who was then a guide for bus tours of New York City. Levitch had become popular for his unconventional narrative about the city that he delivered at a frenetic pace.\n\n==Production==\nThe production of the film has also drawn critical commentary. [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"'The Cruise' is a typical example of low-budget documentary film making. It's in grainy black-and-white (a blowup from the video it was shot on) with a flat audio. Oddly, however, this approach gives Levitch's New York City a timeless quality. The Gershwin song \"But Not for Me\" plays as the camera captures the modern skyline, creating a sense of the past and present blurring together.\n\nThe film was in production for 3.5 years and Miller worked as a one-man camera crew, solely operating a handheld video camera, a wireless microphone on Levitch, and a Sennheiser shotgun microphone that was collapsible and thus easily transportable. Miller discarded the first 80 hours of footage he captured of Levitch only to start from scratch. Levitch reportedly chose not to sit in on the majority of the editing process, choosing instead to stick to his core principles: to succumb to the chaos of the universe. The production team, including editor Michael Levine, spent 8 months editing the film.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Cruise |last=Berardinelli |first=James |date=1998 |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/cruise.html |work=ReelViews}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Cruise'' was initially rejected by many film festivals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} It premiered at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival in 1998 and was later screened at New York's Docfest. On October 14, 1998, ''The Cruise'' was released in New York City at the Angelika Film Center. After being picked up by distributor Artisan Entertainment, it was released nationwide on November 6, 1998.\n\n''The Cruise'' was released to DVD in 2006.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date=2006 |title=The Cruise |medium=DVD |publisher=Lions Gate Home Entertainment |location= |oclc=64552509}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAt the time of the film's release, [[Stephen Holden]] wrote, \"Filmed in high-contrast black and white that makes the city look harshly magnificent, at once irresistible and forbidding, ''The Cruise'' could be described as a whirlwind tour both of New York and of Levitch's feverish mind.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=October 23, 1998 |title='The Cruise': Strong Opinions of a Dizzy Tour Guide |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/102398cruise-film-review.html}}</ref> Following the film's release to DVD in 2006, Brett Cullum wrote, \"Although we do get to see some familiar sites, including winsome glimpses of the World Trade Center towers, the camera hardly ever leaves the face of our tour guide. This is all one extended character study, and is not concerned with narrative or sight seeing. No, this is a [[dadaist]] manifesto delivered off the pavement leading to the Brooklyn bridge. It runs like an hour of poetic jazz\u2014verbal scats and flourishes aplenty.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Cruise |first=Brett |last=Cullum |date=March 13, 2006 |work=DVD Verdict |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/thecruise.php}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n''The Cruise'' was nominated for several awards, including Best Documentary from the [[Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Documentary Film|Online Film Critics Society]] and the [[Satellite Award for Best Documentary Film|Satellite Awards]].
