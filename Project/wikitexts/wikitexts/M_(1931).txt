An early example of a [[procedural drama]], the film centers on the manhunt for Lorre's character, conducted by both the police and the [[Organized crime|criminal underworld]].<ref>''Monsters of Weimar'' pp. 296\u201398</ref>\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Lang and his wife [[Thea von Harbou]] and was the director's first [[sound film]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19930 |title=Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep: A Brief History of Child Murder in Cinema |work=Bloody Disgusting! |date=22 April 2010 |access-date=19 April 2016}}</ref> It features many cinematic innovations, including the use of long, fluid [[tracking shot]]s, and a musical ''[[leitmotif]]'' in the form of \"[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]\" whistled by Lorre's character.

Beckert sends an anonymous letter to the newspapers, taking credit for the child murders and promising that he will commit others; the police extract clues from the letter, using the new techniques of [[fingerprinting]] and [[handwriting analysis]]. Under mounting pressure from the Prussian government, the police work around the clock. Inspector Karl Lohmann, head of the homicide squad, instructs his men to intensify their search and to check the records of recently released psychiatric patients, focusing on any with a history of violence against children. They stage frequent raids to question known criminals, disrupting [[organized crime]] so badly that {{lang|de|Der Schr\u00e4nker}} (The Safecracker) summons the [[Boss (crime)|crime bosses]] of Berlin's [[Ringvereine]] to a conference. They decide to organize their own manhunt, using beggars to watch the children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/04/m-review-fritz-lang |title=M review \u2013 Fritz Lang's superb thriller fascinates |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |date=4 September 2014 |website=The Guardian}}</ref> Meanwhile, the police search Beckert's rented rooms, find evidence that he wrote the letter there, and lie in wait to arrest him.<ref name=\"auto\">''Monsters of Weimar'' p. 297</ref>\n\nBeckert sees a young girl in the reflection of a shop window and begins to follow her, but stops when the girl meets her mother. He encounters another girl and befriends her, but the blind vendor recognizes his whistling. The vendor tells one of his friends, who follows Beckert and sees him inside a shop with the girl. As the two exit onto the street, the man chalks a large \"M\" (for {{lang|de|M\u00f6rder}}, \"murderer\" in German) on his palm, pretends to trip, and bumps into Beckert, marking the back of his overcoat so that other beggars can easily track him.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  The girl notices the chalk and offers to clean it for him, but before she finishes, Beckert realizes he is being watched and flees the scene, abandoning the girl.\n\nAttempting to evade the beggars' surveillance, Beckert hides inside a large office building just before the workers leave for the evening. The beggars call {{lang|de|Der Schr\u00e4nker}}, who arrives at the building with a team of other criminals. They capture and torture one of the watchmen for information and, after capturing the other two, search the building and catch Beckert in the attic. When one of the watchmen trips the [[Burglar alarm|silent alarm]], the criminals narrowly escape with their prisoner before the police arrive. Franz, one of the criminals, is left behind in the confusion and captured by the police. By falsely claiming that one of the watchmen was killed during the break-in, Lohmann tricks Franz into admitting that the gang only broke into the building to find Beckert and revealing where he will be taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/M|title=M|access-date=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928102959/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/M|archive-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe criminals drag Beckert to an abandoned [[Distillation|distillery]] to face a [[kangaroo court]]. He finds a large, silent crowd awaiting him. Beckert is given a \"lawyer\", who gamely argues in his defense but fails to win any sympathy from the improvised \"jury\". Beckert delivers an impassioned monologue, saying that he cannot control his homicidal urges, while the other criminals present break the law by choice, and further questioning why they as criminals believe they have any right to judge him:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat right have you to speak?

Just as the enraged mob is about to kill Beckert, the police arrive to arrest both him and the criminals.\n\nAs a panel of judges prepares to deliver a verdict at Beckert's real trial, the mothers of three of his victims weep in the gallery. Elsie's mother says that \"No sentence will bring the dead children back\" and that \"One has to keep closer watch over the children\".

''M'' was Lorre's first major starring role, and it boosted his career, even though he was typecast as a [[villain]] for years afterward in films such as ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]'' and ''[[Crime and Punishment (1935 American film)|Crime and Punishment]]''. Before ''M'', Lorre had been mostly a comedic actor. After fleeing from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], he landed a major role in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s first version of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), picking up [[English language|English]] along the way.\n* [[Otto Wernicke]] as Inspector Karl Lohmann. Wernicke made his breakthrough with ''M'' after playing many small roles in [[silent film]]s for over a decade.

He immediately began receiving threatening letters in the mail and was also denied a studio space to shoot the film at the [[Staaken Studios]]. When Lang confronted the head of Staaken Studio to find out why he was being denied access, the studio head informed Lang that he was a member of the [[Nazi party]] and that the party suspected that the film was meant to depict the Nazis.<ref>Jensen, Paul M.

According to this viewpoint its origins in mutiny and revolution made the Weimar Republic into an illegitimate state that could not maintain social order because the Republic itself was born of disorder.<ref name=\"Kaes, Dimendberg, Jay p.719\"/> Lang followed these debates closely and incorporated them into several of his Weimar films such as ''M''.

Ebert also argued the film's characters, nearly all [[grotesques]], embodied Lang's distaste for his adopted homeland: \"What I sense is that Lang hated the people around him, hated Nazism, and hated Germany for permitting it.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=August 3, 1997 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=M movie review (1931) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-m-1931 |website=RogerEbert.com }}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nLang considered ''M'' to be his favorite of his own films because of the social criticism in the film.
