The documentary was shot in 2000 during [[pre-production]] and filming and it was intended as a \"[[making-of]]\" documentary for the film. However, Gilliam's failure to complete his film resulted in the documentary filmmakers retitling their work as ''Lost in la Mancha'' and releasing it independently.\n\nWritten and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, ''Lost in La Mancha'' presents Gilliam's effort to make ''Don Quixote'' as a parallel to Quixote's quest to become a hero. It co-stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jean Rochefort]], and [[Vanessa Paradis]], who were cast as stars for ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote''. It is narrated by [[Jeff Bridges]].\n\nGilliam ultimately succeeded in making ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote'', which was released in 2018. Fulton and Pepe have made a follow-up documentary, titled ''[[He Dreams of Giants]]'', which covers Gilliam's entire scope of work on the Quixote project.\n\n== Background ==\nFinding the source material written by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] too vast, Gilliam and his co-writer decided to create their own version of the Quixote story. They made a major change inspired by [[Mark Twain]]'s 1889 novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''. They planned to have the character of [[Sancho Panza]] appear only early in the film. He was to be replaced by character Toby Grisoni, a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time, whom Don Quixote mistakes for Panza.\n\nGilliam was excited about the film, as he felt that the story of Don Quixote embodies many of his own themes (such as the individual versus society, the concept of sanity, etc.).  He intended to film it entirely in Spain and other nations in Europe. [[Jean Rochefort]] was cast to play Don Quixote, in preparation for which he spent seven months learning English. Toby was to be played by [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Vanessa Paradis]] would have been his love interest.\n\nFulton and Pepe had previously filmed a making-of documentary about Giliam's earlier film ''[[12 Monkeys]]''.\n\n== Production ==\n''Lost in La Mancha'' explores how the film's production issues soon overran schedule and budget. Gilliam tells his crew not to be afraid to tell him that something is too complicated or expensive to be done, because he needs to be restrained sometimes. In another interview, he says he wants his films to be seen and enjoyed by the widest audience possible. But natural forces were more important than his excesses.\n\nOn the first day of shooting, the crew discovered that their outdoor filming location, in the area known as [[Bardenas Reales]], was plagued by nearly constant noise from a nearby [[NATO]] aircraft target practice area. Gilliam decided to continue shooting footage, knowing that he could replace the audio in post-production. But during the second day of shooting, hail and a [[flash flood]] damaged equipment. In addition, it permanently changed the appearance of the location, where some shots had not yet been completed. The entire sequence would have to be reshot.\n\nMore significantly, days later it became apparent that Rochefort was injured. Within a week Gilliam learned that Rochefort had a [[herniated disc]]<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2002/0815/lostinlamancha.html Review: Lost in La Mancha], RTE.ie, 15 August 2002</ref> and would be unable to continue filming. This ended production completely, resulting in a record $15 million insurance claim. The insurance company owned the rights to the screenplay for several years, until they were transferred back to Gilliam. He restarted production of ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | title = Opinion: Pandora: Don Quixote rides again, says delighted Gilliam | author = Alica-Azania Jarvis | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 2008-08-04 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-don-quixote-rides-again-says-delighted-gilliam-884243.html | access-date = 2008-08-04 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080819042752/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-don-quixote-rides-again-says-delighted-gilliam-884243.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date = 2008-08-19}}</ref>\n\nKeith Fulton and Louis Pepe had previously made a documentary about the making of Gilliam's film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' titled ''The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys''. They were strongly supported by Gilliam throughout their filming on the Don Quixote project. Gilliam reportedly often has people documenting the making of films so that should something go wrong, he has a record of the events from his perspective.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\nReleased in 2002, ''Lost in La Mancha'' received very positive reception from critics.
