The film was written by Larry Charles and [[Bob Dylan]], the latter under the pseudonym \"Sergei Petrov\". It stars Dylan alongside a star-heavy cast, including [[John Goodman]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Steven Bauer]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Michael Paul Chan]], [[Christian Slater]], and [[Fred Ward]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn iconic rock legend, Jack Fate ([[Bob Dylan]]), is bailed out of prison to perform a one-man [[benefit concert]] for a decaying future North American society. The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both [[Anarchism|anarchy]] and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''-styled [[totalitarianism]]. It further reflects on [[life]], [[dream]]s, and [[God]]'s place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world.\n\nFate makes it clear that he \"was always a singer and maybe no more than that\". He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents. Rather, he makes it clear that he \"stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago\".\n\n==Pre-production==\nIn the late 1990s, Dylan was allegedly inspired by the films of [[Jerry Lewis]], and decided he wanted to write and star in a [[slapstick]] [[television show]] for the [[HBO]] network.<ref name=\"business\">''[[Business Insider]]'' article: \"[https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-dylan-almost-made-an-hbo-slapstick-comedy-with-a-seinfeld-writer-2014-11 HBO Producer Reveals The Crazy Story Of When Bob Dylan Tried To Make A TV Show].\"</ref> [[Larry Charles]], who had written and produced for ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[Mad About You]]'', was brought in to meet with the musician regarding the project at Dylan's [[boxing|boxing gym]] in [[Santa Monica]].\n\nCharles said that during their initial meeting, a chain-smoking Dylan brought \"out this very ornate beautiful box, like a [[sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerer]] would, and he opens the box and dumps all these pieces of scrap paper on the table...every piece of scrap paper was a hotel stationery, little scraps from [[Norway]] and from [[Belgium]] and [[Brazil]] and places like that, and each little piece of paper had a line, like some kind of little line scribbled or a name scribbled, 'Uncle Sweetheart,' or a weird poetic line or an idea or whatever, and he was like 'I don't know what to do with all this'. And for some reason I was able to go 'oh y'know you can take this...this is a line, this is the character, and the character could say this line\".<ref name=\"business\" /> Dylan's scraps of paper served as the inspiration for much of the project's story and script.\n\nA meeting was arranged with HBO executives and the television project was given the green light. However, upon leaving the meeting, Dylan told Charles, \"I don't want to do it anymore, it's too slapsticky\".<ref name=\"business\" /> Charles decided to stay on as co-writer and director, with the concept of the project eventually evolving from a slapstick television show into the dramatic film ''Masked and Anonymous''. Speaking about his intentions while creating the film, Charles later said, \"I wanted to make a Bob Dylan movie that was like a Bob Dylan song. One with a lot of layers, that had a lot of poetry, that had a lot of surrealism and was ambiguous and hard to figure out, like a puzzle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Robert |first=Daniel |url=https://www.suicidegirls.com/girls/anderswolleck/blog/2679821/borat-director-larry-charles/ |title=Borat Director Larry Charles |publisher=[[SuicideGirls]] |date=April 6, 2007 |access-date=April 10, 2018 |work=Anderswolleck}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film was shot in twenty days and was funded by the [[BBC]], who also distributed the film in the United Kingdom. It was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in the United States, a well-known distributor of independent productions. The soundtrack is composed almost entirely of covers of Bob Dylan songs ranging from his very early 1960s-era material to work as recent as songs from his 1997 [[Grammy]]-award-winning album ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]''. Artists who perform the songs include [[Los Lobos]], [[Sertab Erener]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Jerry Garcia]].<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r647097|label=Masked and Anonymous}}</ref>\n\nMany of the film's actors worked for \"scale\" (union wages) for a chance to appear alongside Dylan, including [[Jeff Bridges]], [[John Goodman]] (reunited after their work together in the 1998 [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which also featured the 1970 Dylan song \"[[The Man in Me]]\"), [[Bruce Dern]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Angela Bassett]]. In addition to several other actors of note, the band of the lead character (which is called \"Simple Twist of Fate\", taken from the song of the same title from Dylan's album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'') is played by Dylan's actual touring band of the time. Other stars in the film include [[Fred Ward]] and [[Val Kilmer]].\n\nJessica Lange was the long-term partner of playwright [[Sam Shepard]], who at Dylan's invitation had written a diary of his 1975 [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] tour, ''Rolling Thunder Logbook''. Shepard also co-wrote Dylan's 1986 song \"[[Brownsville Girl]]\" from the album ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'').\n\nMusic from Dylan's entire career is presented in the movie, though his then recent album ''Time Out Of Mind'' receives considerable play, with \"Dirt Road Blues\" and \"[[Not Dark Yet]]\" both used as background in scenes; Dylan also plays a new arrangement of \"[[Cold Irons Bound]]\" in the film's climax. Furthermore, a live performance of \"[[Standing in the Doorway]]\" was cut from the final edit, but included as a bonus on the DVD.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bob Dylan]] as Jack Fate\n*[[Jeff Bridges]] as Tom Friend\n*[[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Pagan Lace\n*[[John Goodman]] as Uncle Sweetheart\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Nina Veronica\n*[[Luke Wilson]] as Bobby Cupid\n*[[Angela Bassett]] as Mistress\n*[[Steven Bauer]] as Edgar\n*[[Michael Paul Chan]] as Guard\n*[[Bruce Dern]] as Editor\n*[[Ed Harris]] as Oscar Vogel\n*[[Val Kilmer]] as Animal Wrangler\n*[[Cheech Marin]] as Prospero\n*[[Chris Penn]] as Crew Guy #2\n*[[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Soldier\n*[[Mickey Rourke]] as Edmund\n*[[Richard C.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 24%, based on 82 reviews, and an average rating of 4.03/10.

Already an accomplished unit, the band's new configuration was acclaimed as one of Dylan's best touring groups ever.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-10-27|title=Recording With Bob Dylan, Chris Shaw Tells All!|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/recording-with-bob-dylan-chris-shaw-tells-all-37854/|access-date=2021-03-14|website=UNCUT|language=en-GB}}</ref> Highlighted by the interplay of Sexton and guitarist Larry Campbell, the group also featured Dylan's longtime bassist [[Tony Garnier (musician)|Tony Garnier]], as well as two drummers: David Kemper (who left the band in late 2001) and George Receli (who was Kemper's replacement). Dylan began filming ''Masked and Anonymous'' soon after Receli's arrival.\n\n''Masked and Anonymous'' marked the first (and besides one song on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs|The Bootleg Series Vol. 8]]'', only) release of \"live\" material from this unit. According to director Larry Charles, who recorded an interview for the film's DVD release, 20 or more songs were recorded for the film, with Charles telling Dylan he could play anything he wanted. For the most part, the songs were recorded at Stage 6, Ray-Art Studios, [[Canoga Park, California]], on July 18, 2002. Though all were presumably filmed, only a handful were used. The following songs were featured in the film, with unedited versions included in the soundtrack release: \"[[Down in the Flood]]\" (a song from ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''), \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" (traditional), \"Diamond Joe\" (traditional), and \"[[Cold Irons Bound]]\" (a song from ''Time Out Of Mind''&thinsp;).\n\nThe following songs were used for the film, but were never issued on CD: \"Drifter's Escape\" (a song from ''[[John Wesley Harding]]''), \"I'll Remember You\" (a song from ''[[Empire Burlesque]]''), \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" (from ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''), \"[[Watching the River Flow]]\" (a song dating from 1971, when it was released as a single), \"Dirt Road Blues\" (from ''Time Out Of Mind''&thinsp;) and \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" (traditional). Of these songs, only \"I'll Remember You\" was featured unedited and uninterrupted in the film.\n\nAs mentioned, \"[[Standing in the Doorway]]\" (another song from ''Time Out of Mind''&thinsp;) was featured as an alternate scene on the DVD. \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\" (a song Dylan first recorded for ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid]]''&thinsp;) was also filmed, but only a brief portion appears in the DVD's supplemental material. A new 'fiddle' arrangement of \"[[If You See Her, Say Hello]]\" (from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'') was also filmed, but it only appears as background music during the DVD's supplemental material. Larry Charles mentions \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\" (a song from ''John Wesley Harding'') during his interview on the DVD \u2013 saying Dylan intended to play it until the last moment, then decided not to.\n\nAs mentioned, a new recording of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" was used for the film. This is heard over the film's final shots and end credits. Unlike the other performances used in the film, this was a concert performance recorded at Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, [[Santa Cruz, California]], on March 16, 2000 (when David Kemper was still with the band). This performance was previously found on the limited edition bonus CD single given away with ''The Best of Bob Dylan Vol. 2'' in the United Kingdom, and it was also featured on a promo CD single ''Live & Rare 2''. Approximately 45 seconds of the harmonica solo was cut for the film while the previous CD releases feature the performance unedited.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1 = [[My Back Pages]]\n| length1 = 4:01\n| extra1 = Magokoro Brothers|-\n| title2 = [[Gotta Serve Somebody]]\n| length2 = 5:50\n| extra2 = [[Shirley Caesar]]|-\n| title3 = [[Down in the Flood]]\n| note3 = live\n| length3 = 3:36\n| extra3 = [[Bob Dylan]]\n| title4 = [[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]\n| length4 = 7:26\n| extra4 = [[Grateful Dead]]|-\n| title5 = [[Most of the Time]]\n| length5 = 5:30\n| extra5 = [[Sophie Zelmani]]|-\n| title6 = [[On a Night Like This (Bob Dylan song)|On A Night Like This]]\n| length6 = 3:11\n| extra6 = [[Los Lobos]]|-\n| title7 = Diamond Joe\n| note7 = live\n| length7 = 2:32\n| extra7 = [[Bob Dylan]]|-\n| title8 = [[Like a Rolling Stone|Come Una Pietra Scalciata (Like a Rolling Stone)]]\n| length8 = 4:12\n| extra8 = [[Articolo 31]]|-\n| title9 = [[One More Cup of Coffee]]\n| length9 = 3:52\n| extra9 = [[Sertab]]|-\n| title10 = [[If You See Her, Say Hello|Non Dirle Che Non E' Cosi' (If You See Her, Say Hello)]]\n| length10 = 4:53\n| extra10 = [[Francesco De Gregori]]|-\n| title11 = [[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\n| note11 = live\n| length11 = 2:12\n| extra11 = [[Bob Dylan]]|-\n| title12 = [[Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)]]\n| length12 = 7:50\n| extra12 = [[Jerry Garcia]]\n| title13 = [[Cold Irons Bound]]\n| note13 = live\n| length13 = 5:43\n| extra13 = [[Bob Dylan]]|-\n| title14 = City of Gold\n| length14 = 5:35\n| extra14 = [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]]\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of songs written by Bob Dylan]]\n*[[List of artists who have covered Bob Dylan songs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0319829|Masked and Anonymous}}\n* {{Mojo title|maskedandanonymous|Masked and Anonymous}}\n\n{{Larry Charles}}\n{{Bob Dylan}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Masked And Anonymous}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:BBC Film films]]\n[[Category:Works by Bob Dylan]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about Bob Dylan]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Larry Charles]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Blackface minstrel shows and films]]\n[[Category:2003 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
