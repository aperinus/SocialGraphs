The scientists there have been studying the planet and its ocean for many decades. Shortly before Kelvin's arrival, the crew exposed the ocean to a high-energy [[gamma-ray]] bombardment. The ocean's response tests the scientists' minds by confronting them with their most painful thoughts and memories. The ocean does this by materializing physical human [[simulacra]]. Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her [[suicide]]. The torments of the other researchers are only suggested, but seem even worse than Kelvin's personal ordeal. The ocean's intelligence expresses physical phenomena in ways difficult for their limited science to explain, deeply upsetting the scientists. The alien mind of Solaris appears to differ so much from the human mind that communication doesn't seem possible.\n\nIn a final experiment, Snaut and Sartorius record Kelvin's brain waves and beam them at Solaris. Unknown to Snaut and Sartorius, Kelvin, while his brain waves are being recorded, wishes that Kelvin and Snaut's visitors disappear but Harey stays. Kelvin tells the crew that he and Harey are to return to Earth. However, Snaut talks to Harey in private and says that she will not be allowed on Earth and would not make it anyway since she only exists because of the energy directed at the space station by Solaris. The night before Kelvin and Harey are due to leave, Harey tricks Kelvin into taking a sleeping draught and while he is asleep writes a second suicide note to him, then goes to Snaut and Sartorius who have built a machine to cancel out the effects of Solaris making the visitors disappear. Harey asks them what it will be like, Snaut says it 'will be like a flash and breath of wind'. Harey is gone, the visitors do not return and the three scientists agree to stay on the station.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vasily Lanovoy]] as Dr. Kris Kelvin\n* [[Vladimir Etush]] as Dr. Snaut\n* [[Viktor Zozulin]] as Dr. Sartorius\n* {{ill|Antonina Pilyus|ru|\u041f\u0438\u043b\u044e\u0441, \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} as Harey\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring space stations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=1808484|title=Solaris (1968)}}\n* [http://scifi.dead-donkey.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=18691 ''Solaris'' (1968,RU) - Film Images.]\n* [http://vasillanovoy.narod.ru/scr_solaris.html ''Solaris'' (1968,RU) - Film Images] ([[Vasily Lanovoy]]).\n* [http://www.kino-teatr.ru/teatr/movie/15910/annot/ ''\u0421\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0438\u0441'' (1968,RU) \u041a\u0418\u041d\u041e-\u0422\u0415\u0410\u0422\u0420.] ([http://www.kino-teatr.ru/teatr/movie/15910/forum/ Forum comments, RU]).\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1bi-ndKQEE Video - ''Solaris'' (1968) - Trailer (00:54)].\n<!---\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkcNY-SSD1U Video - Solaris (1968) - Complete (142:27)] ([http://subsmax.com/subtitles-movie/solyaris--k4fh/download-subtitle/3924289 eng-subs]).\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZbrLX6rFJs Video - Deleted (02:54)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNGHYYNpiA Video - Scene (07:36)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xZ0IG7K4t4 Video - Clip (09:50)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZpESbn96sQ Video - Complete (142:27)]\n--->\n{{Stanis\u0142aw Lem}}\n\n[[Category:1968 television films]]\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:Fiction set on ocean planets]]\n[[Category:Soviet television films]]\n[[Category:Existentialist films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Polish novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:Films set on fictional planets]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Russian nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:Russian science fiction drama films]]"}]}}}}
