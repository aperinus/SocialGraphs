The socialite character of the play\u2014performed by Hepburn in the film\u2014was inspired by [[Helen Hope Montgomery Scott]] (1904\u20131995), a Philadelphia socialite known for her hijinks, who married a friend of playwright Barry.<ref>Irvine, Ian [http://www.reelclassics.com/Movies/Philstory/tracylord-article.htm \"The Real Philadelphia Story\"] at [http://www.reelclassics.com ReelClassics.com]</ref>\n\nWritten for the screen by  [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] and an uncredited [[Waldo Salt]], it is considered one of the best examples of a [[comedy of remarriage]], a genre popular in the 1930s and 1940s in which a couple divorce, flirt with outsiders, and then remarry\u2014a useful story-telling device at a time when the depiction of extramarital affairs was blocked by the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]].\n\nThe film was Hepburn's first big hit following several flops, which had placed her on a 1938 list of actors considered to be \"box office poison\" compiled by Manhattan movie theater owner Harry Brandt.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=January 20, 1941 |title=The New Pictures |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772652,00.html |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223105921/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772652,00.html |archive-date=December 23, 2009 |access-date=December 18, 2011}}</ref> Hepburn acquired the film rights to the play, which she had also starred in, with the help of [[Howard Hughes]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hyde |first=Douglas |date=February 23, 2005 |title=The Hughes-Hepburn affair; Hepburn biographer describes 'tender' relationship |work=CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/23/hughes.hepburn/}}</ref> in order to control it as a vehicle for her screen comeback.<ref name=tcmnotes /> According to a Turner Broadcasting documentary ''MGM: When the Lion Roars'', after [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased the film rights, they were skeptical about Hepburn's box office appeal, so MGM studio head [[Louis B.

MGM [[remake|remade]] the film in 1956 as a [[musical film|musical]], retitled ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Grace Kelly]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n''The Philadelphia Story'' was produced by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] in 1995.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Philadelphia Story 9.jpg|thumb|left|Mike carries Tracy into the house from a midnight dip.]]\n\nTracy Lord is the elder daughter of a wealthy [[Philadelphia Main Line]] socialite family. She was married to C.K. Dexter Haven, a yacht designer and member of her social set, but divorced him two years prior, because, according to her father, he does not measure up to the standards she sets for all her friends and family: He drank too much for her taste, and, according to him, as she became critical of him, he drank more. Their only interaction while married, the film's opening scene, is her breaking his golf clubs and him pushing her to the ground. Now, she is about to marry ''[[nouveau riche]]'' \"man of the people\" George Kittredge.\n\n[[File:PhiladelphiaStory trailer.png|right|thumb|Tracy is short a groom, with a roomful of wedding guests waiting.]]\n\nIn New York, ''Spy'' magazine publisher Sidney Kidd is eager to cover the wedding, and assigns reporter Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie. Kidd intends to use the assistance of Dexter, who has been working for ''Spy'' in South America. Dexter tells Kidd that he will introduce them as friends of Tracy's brother Junius (a U.S. diplomat in Argentina). Tracy is not fooled, but Dexter tells her that Kidd has threatened the reputation of her family with an innuendo-laden article about her father's affair with a dancer. Tracy deeply resents her father's infidelity, which has prompted her parents to live separately. Nonetheless, to protect her family's reputation, she agrees to let Mike and Liz stay and cover her wedding.\n\nDexter is welcomed back with open arms by Tracy's mother Margaret and teenage sister Dinah, much to Tracy's frustration. She soon discovers that Mike has admirable qualities, and even seeks out his book of short stories in the public library. As the wedding nears, she finds herself torn between her fianc\u00e9 George, Dexter, and Mike.\n\nThe night before the wedding, Tracy gets drunk for only the second time in her life, kisses Mike, and ultimately takes an innocent midnight swim with him. When George observes Mike carrying an intoxicated Tracy into the house afterward, he assumes the worst. The next day, he tells her that he was shocked and feels entitled to an explanation before going ahead with the wedding. Yet, she admits she really has none, and realizes that he does not really know her at all. He has loved her as a perfect, ideal angel, an embodiment of goodness\u2014a virginal statue\u2014and not as a person, so she breaks off the engagement. By now she better understands her own imperfections and her criticism of others. Tracy realizes that all the guests have arrived and are waiting for the ceremony to begin. Mike quickly volunteers to marry her, but she graciously declines because she perceives that Liz is in love with him. Then, Dexter, who clearly planned to win her back all along, offers to remarry her, and she gladly accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Stewart]] as Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor \n* [[Cary Grant]] as C.K.
