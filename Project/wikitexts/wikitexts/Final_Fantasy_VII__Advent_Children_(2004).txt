Developed by [[Visual Works]] and [[Square Enix]], ''Advent Children'' is part of the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' series of media, which is based in the world and continuity of the highly successful 1997 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. ''Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc]]s with Japanese voice acting in Japan on September 14, 2005, and on April 25, 2006, with English voice acting in North America and the UK.\n\n''Advent Children'' takes place two years after the events of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and focuses on the appearance of a trio that kidnaps children infected with an unexplained disease. ''Final Fantasy VII'' hero [[Cloud Strife]], suffering from the same disease, goes to rescue the children. He discovers that the trio plan to resurrect the villain [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] using the remains of the extraterrestrial villain Jenova, and he and his compatriots from the game fight to stop them. The film's voice acting cast includes [[Takahiro Sakurai]], [[Ayumi Ito]], and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] in Japanese, and [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]], [[Rachael Leigh Cook]], and [[George Newbern]] in English.\n\nThe film has been released in multiple versions; ''Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete'', released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2009, is the last version and adds 26 minutes of new and expanded scenes to the 101-minute original. The film has received mixed reviews. Critics have praised its [[animation]] and [[Computer animation|CGI]] work. Still, the plot has been criticized as incomprehensible to viewers who did not play ''Final Fantasy VII'' and a thin connection between action scenes. It received the \"Maria Award\" at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] in 2005 and the \"Best [[Anime]] Feature\" at the 2007 [[American Anime Awards]]. The original release was one of the best-selling animated movies in Japan and the United States in its release year. The ''Complete'' release was noted as driving a large increase in sales of the [[PlayStation 3]] console in its release week. By May 2009, the DVD and Universal Media Disc releases had sold over 4.1&nbsp;million copies worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series|Final Fantasy VII#Plot}}\n\n===Setting===\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n''Advent Children'' takes place two years following the events of the 1997 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', during which the antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] attempted to absorb the Lifestream (the lifeblood and soul of the Planet) and be reborn as a god.<ref name=\"FF7quote\"/> He was defeated by [[Cloud Strife]] and [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series|his companions]]. Still, Sephiroth's final spell, Meteor, destroyed the city of [[Midgar]]. \n \t\nSince the end of the game, the survivors of Midgar founded the new city of Edge, where Cloud and his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]] now run a courier service and are the caretakers of an orphan [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Denzel|Denzel]] and the adopted daughter of [[Barret Wallace]], [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Marlene|Marlene]]. Due to feeling guilty for failing to save [[Aerith Gainsborough]], Cloud has recently moved out and isolated himself from his friends. The story also portrays that many people, including Cloud and Denzel, are infected with a mysterious disease known as \"Geostigma,\" which has no known cure.\n\n===Story===\n{{Final Fantasy VII chronology}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should only be kept between 400 to 700 words.

The trio is the physical manifestation of Sephiroth's surviving spirit. They are seeking to resurrect him using the remains of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] villain [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Jenova|Jenova]].<ref name=\"jenova\"/> Cloud refuses to help and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Kadaj and his colleagues are recruiting children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight, and Loz kidnaps Marlene. All the abducted children are taken to the ruins of the Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren. He announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, Kadaj's gang overpower him but is saved by his old comrade [[Vincent Valentine]]. Cloud then returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population.<ref name=\"InteSakurai\"/> With the help of his companions from ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.\n\nKadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he possesses Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj saves it and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are caught in a blast along the way by an explosive planted by Reno and Rude. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud he will use the souls of Geostigma's deceased victims to dominate the Planet.<ref name=\"cosmos\"/> He and Cloud then fight. Throughout the encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. Cloud replies that he cherishes everything and then uses his Limit Break, Omnislash Ver. 5, to defeat Sephiroth. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.\n\nCloud has a vision of his deceased friends Aerith and [[Zack Fair]], who says that his time to join them has not yet come. He then awakens in the church, healed of his injuries, and surrounded by his friends. Behind them, he sees Aerith and Zack leaving the church and hears Aerith's voice say, \"You see, everything's all right.\" He agrees: \"I know. I'm not alone... not anymore.\"\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Takahiro Sakurai (left) and Toshiyuki Morikawa (right) voiced Cloud Strife and Sephiroth, respectively.\n | image1    = Sakurai Takahiro from \"GODZILLA The Planet Eater\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2018 (31747117738).jpg\n | alt1      = Takahiro Sakurai\n | caption1  =\n | image2    = Toshiyuki_Morikawa_(cropped).jpg\n | alt2      = Toshiyuki Morikawa\n | caption2  =\n | perrow = 2\n | total_width = 320\n}}\n''Advent Children'' was released with a Japanese voice track in Japan, and an English voice track elsewhere.<ref name=\"1upVAs\"/>\n*[[Takahiro Sakurai]]/[[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] as [[Cloud Strife]].

[[Kazushige Nojima]], who had written the script for the game, was brought on to write a 20-minute script. He decided to write \"a story about Cloud and Tifa and the kids\".<ref name=\"Hist of FF7\"/> The film was developed as a part of the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', a set of different media content intended to expand upon the world of ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name=\"COMP\"/> Square's research and development department worked with [[Visual Works]] on the piece, and [[Tetsuya Nomura]] joined the crew after ''VII''{{'}}s director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] called him. Early in pre-production, the team thought about making ''Advent Children'' into a game. Still, Nomura decided against it, partially because [[Visual Works]] had no experience making a full game. The creators had no prior experience working on films, so they fell back on their knowledge of [[Cutscene|in-game movies]].<ref name=\"ACproduction\"/>\n\nThe film was planned to focus on the characters of Cloud and Tifa in a similar way to how other titles from ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' centered on certain characters; for example, ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII|Before Crisis]]'' focuses on the Turks, ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII|Crisis Core]]'' on Zack Fair, and ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII|Dirge of Cerberus]]'' on Vincent.<ref name=\"COMP\"/> Nomura says the film was, in its first manifestation, only going to be 20 minutes long. The original story featured someone requesting a message to be sent to Cloud; the message is relayed to Cloud through several children. When the message finally reaches Cloud, it is revealed who the messenger is. Nomura very much liked the original script, and it became the foundation of the final version. He decided to make the project longer and grander in scope when the early word of the film generated great interest among ''Final Fantasy VII'' fans, most of whom wanted something feature-length. The film's length was expanded to 100 minutes.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\nTakeshi Nozue and Nomura, who had first worked together on the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', split the role of directing, as Nomura felt this would add depth to the film. In designing the battle scenes, they first discussed the setting and layout. They then went to the staff with their ideas, deciding which were the best and developing them further. The battle between Cloud's group and Bahamut was the most difficult to design due to the size of the area and the number of objects the staff had to add to the scene to keep it realistic. The alternating positions of the characters, including Bahamut itself, took the staff a long time to complete to give the scene a sense of flow.<ref name=\"prologue\"/> Nomura stated that the team decided not to worry about making the fight sequences realistic, as they felt this would restrict their ability to give the film a \"cool look\". Therefore, they worked by creating their \"own rules\". [[Motion capture]] was used for many of the film's battle scenes; maneuvers that were not physically possible for live actors to perform were constructed digitally.<ref name=\"making\"/>\n\nWhile designing the characters, the staff discovered that it was impossible to translate the ''Final Fantasy VII'' designs into the film. Thus some identifying characteristics had to be discarded.<ref name=\"gspot\"/> Cloud's redesign was a combination of eight different designs, from his [[super deformed]] appearance in the game to his more realistic appearance in the film. The difficulties in making Sephiroth led the staff to reduce his appearances in the film. It took them two years to develop and refine his look.<ref name=\"prologue\"/> Nozue also had difficulty developing a framework for Tifa's body that was \"balanced, yet showed off her feminine qualities\".{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=24}} In April 2003, it was decided that Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo would be manifestations of Sephiroth's spirit\u2014his [[cruelty]], [[Physical strength|strength]], and [[interpersonal attraction|allure]] respectively.{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=26-31}} In contrast to Sephiroth, the trio was meant to be younger than Cloud, to focus on the \"next generation\" theme.<ref name=\"making\"/> By October 2003, Nomura said that the film was 10% complete, stating that while the script was written, not all the characters were designed.<ref name=\"gspot\"/>\n\nNomura felt that ''Advent Children'' differed from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], where the meaning of most scenes tends to be explained. However, with ''Advent Children'', the staff wanted viewers to interpret the scenes individually, allowing them to come to different conclusions.<ref name=\"prologue\"/> Nojima described the theme of the film as \"survival\".<ref name=\"gspot\"/> Other themes Nomura and Nojima were concerned to include Cloud's feelings of guilt and regret for failing to save his friends Zack and Aerith. These feelings are symbolized by a grey wolf that appears whenever Cloud thinks about them. The wolf disappears at the end of the film as Cloud comes to terms with his feelings.{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=86}} The word \"children\" was used in the title to refer to the film's children, as they represent the \"next generation\".<ref name=\"making\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of the Final Fantasy VII series#Advent Children}}\n[[File:Nobuo Uematsu.jpg|thumb|Nobuo Uematsu in 2006.]]\nThe music of ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], Keiji Kawamori, [[Kenichiro Fukui]], and [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]], and arranged by Fukui, Sekito, Kawamori, [[Shir\u014d Hamaguchi]], and [[Kazuhiko Toyama]]. Nomura would make some changes and have the composers re-record the piece upon hearing each track.{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=88-90}} The end theme, \"Calling\", was written and performed by former [[Bo\u00f8wy]] vocalist [[Kyosuke Himuro]]. The soundtrack includes both pieces original to the film and arrangements of works from ''Final Fantasy VII'', originally composed by Uematsu. Some of the arrangements, including \"Advent: One-Winged Angel\", are performed by [[The Black Mages]], a rock band formed by Uematsu, Fukui, and Sekito.<ref name=\"RPGFAC\"/> Both the pieces are original to the film, and the film arrangements cover a variety of musical styles, including [[orchestra]]l, [[Choir|choral]], [[Piano|classical piano]], and [[rock music]]; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the styles vary between \"sparse piano noodlings, pop-metal thrashings, and cloying power ballads\".<ref name=\"VARIETY\"/> The 2005 soundtrack album ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack'' collects 26 tracks of music from the film on two discs. Square Enix published it on September 28, 2005. In addition to the regular release, a limited edition was produced containing alternative cover art and a booklet of credits and lyrics.<ref name=\"RPGFAC\"/> The soundtrack album reached position #15 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] music charts and stayed on the charts for ten weeks.<ref name=\"ORIAC\"/>\n\nA mini-album entitled ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Mini Album'' was released on April 10, 2009, to coincide with the release of the ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete'' version of the film.<ref name=\"ACMINI\"/> This version of the film included a new ending theme, \"Safe and Sound\", by Kyosuke Himuro and [[My Chemical Romance]] singer [[Gerard Way]].<ref name=\"Safe\"/> \"Water\" was replaced with a new song\u2014\"Anxious Heart\".<ref name=\"ACMINI\" /> Tracks on the album included new versions of \"The Chase of Highway\", \"Those Who Fight Further\", \"Sign\", \"Advent: One-Winged Angel\", and \"On the Way to a Smile\".<ref name=\"SEMOACMINI\"/> A larger album, ''Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete: Reunion Tracks'', was released with 21 tracks on September 16, 2009. This album contains the tracks from the mini-album and several lengthened pieces for the ''Complete'' film version but not rearranged.<ref name=\"RPGFcomplete\"/> ''Reunion Tracks'' appeared on the Oricon charts for a single week at position #108.<ref name=\"ORIACMINI\"/>\n\n==Promotion and release==\n''Advent Children'' and the ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' series were first announced at the 2003 [[Tokyo Game Show]] in September 2003. The movie was announced as a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film.{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=74}}<ref name=\"acunveiled2\"/> The first trailer for the movie was featured in the international version of the video game ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', released in February 2004.<ref name=\"animefringe\"/> The trailer used a motion capture that was altered in the final film.<ref name=\"gspot\"/> ''Advent Children'' was initially scheduled for a September 13, 2005 release in North America and a September 14, 2005 release in Japan,<ref name=\"ACreleasedate\"/><ref name=\"ACreleasedate2\"/> but the North American release date was pushed back several times.

The edition contains various pieces of merchandise, a copy of the script, the original ''Final Fantasy VII'' game, a strategy guidebook for the game, and a disc containing the [[original video animation]] (OVA) ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"animefringe\"/> Nomura stated that meaning of the name ''Advent Pieces'' was that \"advent\" means \"the recognition and commemoration of something\", while \"pieces\" was added to bring special meaning to the release.{{sfn|Square Enix|2006|p=101}} A special one-time-only theatrical screening of the English version of the film took place on April 3, 2006, at the [[ArcLight Hollywood|Arclight Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]].

The film's staff wanted to add links to the other titles in the ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' released since the original film. The version has more violence, specifically blood during the fights, as the staff wanted to bring a \"dirtier\" look to the film, with characters' faces and clothes getting darker and dirtier throughout the battles.<ref name=\"JSblood\"/> Additionally, the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was expanded by several minutes and included a scene in which Sephiroth impales Cloud on his sword and holds him in the air, mirroring the scene in the game where he performs the same action.<ref name=\"famitsu\"/>\n\n''Advent Children Complete'' was released in North America on June 2, 2009,<ref name=\"adventbook\"/> and in the UK on July 27, 2009.<ref name=\"ACCEU\"/> The North American and European versions come with a new trailer for ''Final Fantasy XIII'' rather than a demo.<ref name=\"FF13trailer\"/> The releases in all regions also feature an animated piece entitled \"On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel\", as well as the story digests \"Reminiscence of ''Final Fantasy VII''\" and \"Reminiscence of ''Final Fantasy VII Compilation''\". The Japanese and English voice actors returned to record additional dialogues for the new and expanded scenes. Nomura stated no major problems with this process, noting that Sakurai and Morikawa were already used to their characters from voicing them in other media.

Denzel tells his life story, including how he became an orphan, the events leading up to his becoming afflicted with Geostigma, and how he came under the care of Tifa and Cloud.<ref name=\"Smile\"/> \"Case of Denzel\" was adapted into ''On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel'', a short OVA animated by [[A-1 Pictures]] that was released with ''Advent Children Complete''.<ref name=\"adventbook\"/><ref name=\"GSbrotherhood\"/>\n\nThe second short story, \"Case of Tifa\", is Tifa's account of the events following Meteor's destruction and her life with Cloud, overlapping in part with Denzel's story. A third ''On the Way to a Smile'' story, \"Case of Barrett\", involves Barret and his struggles to find a new energy source for the world's people. To coincide with the release of ''Advent Children Complete'' in 2009, four more stories were written: \"Case of Red XIII\", \"Case of Yuffie\", \"Case of Shinra\", and \"Case of Lifestream - Black & White\". All the stories were released together as a book titled ''On the Way to a Smile'' at the same time that ''Advent Children Complete'' was released.<ref name=\"Smile\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Sales===\nThe DVD releases of ''Advent Children'' sold over 410,000 copies in Japan during their first week on sale, with roughly half of the sales coming from the limited edition.<ref name=\"Oricon2005\"/> The DVD and UMD releases combined sold over 700,000 units in Japan in the first three weeks and over one million copies by January 2006.<ref name=\"GSsales\"/> In a 2005 [[Oricon]] Japanese sales report, the regular edition of the DVD ranked twelfth on the bestseller list in Japan for the entire year after one week of sales, and the limited edition ranked fifteenth.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 50% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10.<ref name=\"Rt\"/> The computer-animated graphics were generally praised; [[1UP.com]]'s James Mielke, who awarded the film an \"A\u2212\", said the quality and clarity of the CG visuals were \"genuinely amazing\".<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/> [[Anime News Network]] writer Carlo Santos praised the animation while awarding the film a \"B\", calling it \"outstanding\". [[About.com]]'s Roger Altizer, while giving the film overall 2 and a half stars out of 5, cited the visuals as one of its few positive points.<ref name=\"ANNreview\"/><ref name=\"ABOUTreview\"/> The film's plot was generally criticized as confusing; Leslie Felperin of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', in a sharply negative review, described the plot as \"soulless\" and \"utterly impenetrable\" to anyone who had not played the game, and Anime News Network's Santos agreed that people who had not played ''Final Fantasy VII'' would not understand the story.<ref name=\"VARIETY\"/><ref name=\"ANNreview\"/> Mania Entertainment's John Eriani also found the plot confusing to non-players, though he liked how the characters were further explored in the film.<ref name=\"MANIAreview\"/> Todd Douglass Jr. from [[DVD Talk]], while \"highly recommending\" the film, praised Cloud's character development in particular.<ref name=\"DVDTreview\"/> [[About.com]]'s Altizer summarized the plot and dialogue as \"weak\", and [[IGN]]'s Chris Carle, in their 9 out of 10 reviews, felt that the plot was just an excuse to get to the next action sequence.<ref name=\"ABOUTreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> The story digest \"Reminiscence of ''Final Fantasy VII''\", included with the DVD to explain the plot of ''Final Fantasy VII'', was described by Anime News Network's Santos as \"just as confusing as the movie\" and of no help in explaining the plot to anyone who had not already played the game; though Carle of IGN felt it was helpful to those who had not played the game in a while.<ref name=\"ANNreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nThe action scenes were generally praised. RPGamer's Michael Beckett, while giving the film a 4 out of 5, lauded the film's fighting scenes, calling them \"mesmerizing\" and the primary focus of the movie.<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> Anime News Network's Santos also heavily praised the action sequences, and Felperin of ''Variety'' felt they were the only point to the movie, which they felt focused entirely on the technical aspects of the action.<ref name=\"VARIETY\"/><ref name=\"ANNreview\"/> The music received mixed reviews; Eriani of Mania Entertainment heavily praised it, as did Santos of Anime News Network, but 1UP.com's Mielke called it \"a bit sappy\".<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/><ref name=\"ANNreview\"/><ref name=\"MANIAreview\"/> Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk concluded that ''Advent Children'' \"is pretty much the film that fans all over the world have been waiting for\"; RPGamer's Beckett said that \"the film feels very much like a love letter to the fans of ''Final Fantasy VII''\"; and IGN's Carle summed up the film as \"glorious, beautiful, well-executed fan service\".<ref name=\"DVDTreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/>\n\nDestructoid noted there was a message within the writing of the film regarding the characters' lives in Midgar, leading them to move on with their lives in a similar fashion to ''Final Fantasy VII'' gamers since the story ended with Cloud saving Midgar from Sephiroth's resurrection which would threaten it again especially when the spirit of Zack Fair reminds him that he has already defeated him already.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-message-to-fans-in-advent-children-complete/|title=The message to fans in Advent Children Complete|website=Destructoid|accessdate=February 2, 2022}}</ref> [[Kotaku]] saw the focus on the Midgar's ruins as a parallelism with psychological trauma due to how all of its survivors suffer a disease that cannot be fought with Cloud's striking weaponry on its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/15-years-on-final-fantasy-vii-advent-children-is-a-lo-1845045609|title=15 Years On, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Is A Lot Smarter Than I Remember|website=Kotaku|accessdate=February 2, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe director's cut, ''Advent Children Complete'', was generally praised over the original version. [[Joystiq]]'s Andrew Yoon found ''Advent Children Complete'' a better film, feeling it was more accessible to people who had not played ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name=\"JScompreview\"/> Blu-ray.com's Dustin Somner called it \"a nice improvement on an entertaining film\", and DVD Talk's Todd Douglass Jr. said it was \"the best version of the film\" due to its audio quality, the new scenes, and the expansion of Cloud's battle against Sephiroth.<ref name=\"BRcompreview\"/><ref name=\"DVDTcompreview\"/> Douglass also found the addition of ''On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel'' to be a welcome edition, though he felt that the bonus features as a whole were underwhelming, belying the \"Complete\" title.<ref name=\"DVDTcompreview\"/> Yoon of Joystiq thought that the new scenes helped give more depth to Cloud's development, to the point of \"humanizing\" him, though he felt the change in pacing for some scenes made the plot hard to follow.<ref name=\"JScompreview\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer AJ Glasser, however, summed up the director's cut as \"26 extra minutes and it still doesn't make any sense\", saying that the new scenes did little to improve the plot of the film itself.<ref name=\"KTcompreview\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\n''Advent Children'' received the Honorary Maria Award at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 15, 2005.<ref name=\"Maria\"/> The film was also awarded \"best anime feature\" at the 2007 [[American Anime Awards]].<ref name=\"ANNaward\"/> IGN placed it second in their \"Top 10 Straight-to-DVD Animated Movies\" list.<ref name=\"IGNaward\"/> \n\nIn 2007, the [[music video]] for the song \"\uc720\ud639\uc758 \uc18c\ub098\ud0c0\" (\"Sonata of Temptation\") by Korean singer [[Ivy (South Korean singer)|Ivy]] recreated the fight between Tifa and Loz. The director of the video stated that it was just a [[parody]] of the film but could not get Square Enix's official permission.<ref name=\"MVideo\" /> The video was subsequently banned from airing on [[Television in South Korea|Korean television]] after a copyright lawsuit by Square Enix.<ref name=\"MVideoLawsuit\" />\n\n[[OverClocked ReMix]]'s four-disc ''Final Fantasy VII'' unofficial [[tribute album]], ''[[Voices of the Lifestream]]'', contains one disc remixing music from the film.<ref name=\"clocked\" /> \n\n''Final Fantasy XIII'' director [[Motomu Toriyama]] has stated that he felt the film showed \"battles that have not been achievable in FF so far\", and so tried to design the battle system for ''Final Fantasy XIII'' to create cinematic battles like the film.<ref name=\"FF13battles\" /> \n\nCloud's design from the movie is available as an alternate costume for Cloud in the crossover fighting games ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros Ultimate]]''.<ref name=\"Smash Bros\" /> The reveal trailer for Sephiroth as downloadable content in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' recreates the final battle between him and Cloud from the movie, and several songs from the film appear in the game as part of the Sephiroth DLC pack. As part of the update, including Sephiroth, Cloud's Final Smash, the ''Advent Children'' design was changed to Omnislash Ver. 5.<ref name=\"YT\" /> \n\nThe film's storyline will be recreated as part of the 2022 mobile game ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bankhurst |first=Adam |date=2021-02-25 |title=Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier and Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis Announced for Mobile |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-the-first-soldier-and-final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-announced-for-mobile |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<!-- PLOT -->\n\n<ref name=\"FF7quote\">{{cite video game |title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square (video game company)|Square]] |publisher=SCE America |date=September 7, 1997 |platform=[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] |quote='''Aeris:''' How do you intend to become one with the Planet? / '''Sephiroth:''' It's simple.
