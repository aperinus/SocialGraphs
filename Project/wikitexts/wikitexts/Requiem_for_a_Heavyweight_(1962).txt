Afterward, Maish (Gleason) is confronted by bookies who threaten his life.  If he fails to repay them for their ''losses'', based upon the sure thing bet (he urged them to wager upon) that his fighter, Mountain, would go down in a certain round of the match.  Maish's deal with them had been that they should deduct from their winnings (due to their betting against Mountain, as Maish had advised them to).  The vast sums of losses that Maish's betting (and losing) had run up with them.\n\nThe film version is somewhat darker in its plotline than the original teleplay.\n\n== Plot ==\nMountain Rivera (Quinn) is to interview for a counselor position at a children's camp, arranged by Grace Miller, but Maish, hoping that Mountain will forget about the job interview, takes him to a bar, where they both get drunk. Army (Rooney) arrives at the bar to remind Mountain about the appointment, but Rivera embarrasses himself at the hotel where the interview is to take place, behaving drunkenly in plain sight of the camp owners. After this episode, Grace confronts Maish in tears, condemning him for controlling Mountain and ruining his chance to make a new life for himself.\n\nIn the film version, Maish responds forcefully and eloquently to Grace Miller's accusation that he's been over-controlling of Rivera, cares nothing for him, for his best interest or for his future. He tells Grace that she must stop daydreaming and recognize that her idealized conception of Louis Rivera is as false and damaging to Rivera as is Maish's alleged mediocre management of Rivera's pro boxing career, and that her so-called \"vision\" for Rivera's post-boxing future as a counselor at a children's summer camp is as na\u00efve and pathetic as it is improbable.\n\nTo pay off Maish's gambling debts, Mountain agrees to perform as Native American wrestling persona \"Big Chief Mountain Rivera.\" Just prior to entering the ring for his first match, an overwhelming tide of humiliation sweeps over Mountain, causing him to change his mind. Maish blurts out that he bet against Mountain in the fight against Clay, and as Rivera attempts to leave the locker room, \"Ma\" Greeny and her thugs enter, threatening Maish. However, Mountain changes his mind and agrees to wrestle, thereby allowing \"Ma\" to be paid and saving Maish's life. In the epic final scene of the film, Mountain enters the ring amidst jeering ridicule to face \"[[Haystack Calhoun|Haystacks Calhoun]]\", a grappler from Arkansas billed at 601&nbsp;lbs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Luis \"Mountain\" Rivera\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as Maish Rennick\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Army\n* [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Grace Miller\n* [[Stanley Adams (actor)|Stanley Adams]] as Perelli (as Stan Adams)\n* [[Madame Spivy]] as Ma Greeny\n* [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] as Himself \n* [[Val Avery]] as Young fighter's promoter\n* [[Herbie Faye]] as Charlie, the Bartender\n* [[Jack Dempsey]] as Himself\n* [[Haystack Calhoun]] as Himself\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|tt0056406}}\n* [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1080265_requiem_for_a_heavyweight?
