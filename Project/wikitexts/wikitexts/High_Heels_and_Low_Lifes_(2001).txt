It was directed by [[Mel Smith]] and written by [[Kim Fuller]] and Georgia Pritchett.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the story of two women living in London, Shannon ([[Minnie Driver]]) and Frances ([[Mary McCormack]]), attempting to con a group of gangsters, led by Kerrigan ([[Michael Gambon]]) and Mason ([[Kevin McNally]]), into giving them \u00a31,000,000 after they overhear a conversation between gang members during a local bank heist. The idea is that the money will later be used to purchase a large amount of expensive medical equipment for the hospital where Shannon works as an overworked and underpaid nurse. Frances, a failing American actress who has resorted to doing voice acting for children's cartoons, wants the money so that she can get out of the rut she believes she is stuck in, and also because she wants a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] to replace her aging [[Pontiac Firebird]].\n\nThroughout the course of the film, the women threaten the mobsters in order to persuade them to give them a cut of the heist money. As the film progresses, the danger the women are in becomes more obvious, and just as it appears that they are out of their depth \u2013 Frances' car is blown up and Shannon is almost kidnapped \u2013 they successfully break into Mason's house and confront him and one of his gang. A mass shoot-out occurs after it becomes clear that the girls have stolen all of Mason's guns and have bagged all the money. They manage to get away in the gang members' [[Porsche Boxster]] with the [[bags of money]]. The hospital equipment is delivered to Shannon's hospital anonymously, as Shannon and Frances look on. They then drive off into London in the [[Mercedes CLK]] that they have bought with some of the money, happy that they have done the right thing.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Minnie Driver]] as Shannon\n*[[Mary McCormack]] as Frances\n*[[Kevin McNally]] as Alan Mason\n*[[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Tremaine\n*Len Collin as Barry\n*[[Danny Dyer]] as Danny Robinson\n*[[Darren Boyd]] as Ray\n*[[Michael Gambon]] as Kerrigan\n*[[Kevin Eldon]] as McGill\n*[[Hugh Bonneville]] as Farmer\n*[[Mel Smith]] as Man at Train Station (uncredited)\n*Ben Farrow as Julian\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned negative reviews from critics, as it holds a rating of 20% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n==Home media==\nIn the United States, Buena Vista released ''High Heels and Low Lives'' on [[DVD]] on 9 April 2002,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/High-Heels-and-Low-Lifes-DVD/2663/| title=High Heels and Low Lifes DVD| publisher=Blu-ray.com| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> while Mill Creek Entertainment later acquired home distribution rights, releasing the film on 15 March 2016, as part of a \"Pretty Dumb Criminals: Triple Felony Feature\" (with ''[[Big Trouble (2002 film)|Big Trouble]]'' and ''[[Mafia!]]'').<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/Pretty-Dumb-Criminals-Triple-Felony-Feature-DVD/117773/| title=Pretty, Dumb Criminals \u2013 Triple Felony Feature DVD| publisher=Blu-ray.com| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was made available on both [[VHS]] and DVD formats on 13 May 2002 via [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Heels-Low-Lifes-VHS/dp/B00005U1X5/ref=sr_1_3?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1534610915&sr=1-3&keywords=high+heels+and+low+lifes| title=High Heels And Low Lifes [2001] VHS| publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Heels-Low-Lifes-DVD/dp/B00005U1XD/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1534610915&sr=1-1&keywords=high+heels+and+low+lifes| title=High Heels And Low Lifes [2001] DVD| publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBuena Vista also handled distribution rights in Australia, when the film was made available on DVD on 21 August 2002.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/High-Heels-and-Low-Lifes-DVD/139888/| title=High Heels and Low Lifes DVD| publisher=Blu-ray.com| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 August 2018, it was announced that ''High Heels and Low Lifes'' will be available for the first time ever on [[Blu-ray]] on 23 October 2018, by [[Kino Lorber]] under license from [[Disney]] within the United States.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=23783| title=Kino: Gun Shy and High Heels and Low Lifes Dated for Blu-ray| publisher=Blu-ray.com| date=15 August 2018| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> An additional DVD release will also be available from Kino Lorber.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/High-Heels-and-Low-Lifes-DVD/161371/| title=High Heels and Low Lifes DVD| publisher=Blu-ray.com| accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Mel Smith}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mel Smith]]\n[[Category:2001 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
