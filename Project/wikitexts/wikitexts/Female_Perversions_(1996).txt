Kaplan]]. It stars [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Amy Madigan]], [[Karen Sillas]], [[Frances Fisher]], [[Laila Robins]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], and [[Clancy Brown]]. Aspects of female psychology, particularly the more morbid, are explored through the interactions of the characters and through their fantasies.\n\n==Plot==\nEve Stephens, a Los Angeles trial attorney, is almost at the peak of her career: being appointed as a judge. Her private life is less successful. Beneath her cool exterior, Eve is filled with self-doubt and struggles to find satisfaction while conforming to society's expectations of her as a woman. She is troubled by erotic nightmares and flashbacks to the lives of her parents, centering on her unfeeling father and the suspicious death of her mother, Beth. Although she has occasional intense sex \u2013 initially with a male geologist called John, later with a female psychiatrist, Renee \u2013 the relationships lack warmth or commitment on her part. She also feels threatened by Langley Flynn, a younger woman being lined up to replace her as an attorney.\n\nEve's professional and personal lives start to unravel when her intelligent but disturbed sister Maddie, a doctoral student who Eve believes to be a [[kleptomania]]c, is arrested for repeated shoplifting. After Eve [[Bail|bails her out]], Maddie steals the \"lucky suit\" that Eve planned to wear to her interview with the [[California Governor]] about her potential judgeship. During the interview, Eve's anger toward Maddie manifests itself when she tells the Governor that she has no time for family. Feeling disadvantaged as a candidate by her status as an unmarried woman, Eve fears that this admission will cost her the appointment, and subsequently flies into a rage. The two sisters begin to recognize the malignant influence of their parents on their lives and the unsatisfactory responses they unconsciously adopted, one seeking compensation in stealing and the other in sex.\n\nIn the end, the Governor approves Eve's appointment. Later, Eve comes to the aid of Maddie's neighbor Edwina (\"Ed\"), a [[tomboy]]ish 13{{nbh}}year{{nbh}}old who uses [[Self-harm|self{{nbh}}harm]] to cope with the struggles of puberty. As Ed prepares to attempt suicide by jumping off a cliff, Eve runs up behind her and pulls her back from the edge. The last shot is of Ed's face pressed into Eve's lap.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eve Stephens\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Maddie Stephens\n* [[Karen Sillas]] as Renee\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Annunciata\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as John\n* [[Laila Robins]] as Emma\n* [[John Diehl]] as Jake Rock\n* [[Paulina Porizkova]] as Langley Flynn\n* Dale Shuger as Edwina\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Trudy\n* [[Marcia Cross]] as Beth Stephens\n* [[John Cassini]] as gas station attendant\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as make-up salesgirl\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was rated 3.5 out of 4 stars by [[Roger Ebert]],<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/female-perversions-1997 Review by Roger Ebert], accessed February 15, 2021.</ref> 4 out of 5 stars by ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''<ref>[https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1997-05-23/142452/ Review by ''The Austin Chronicle''], accessed February 15, 2021.</ref> and 3 out of 5 stars by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.<ref>[https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/female-perversions-review/ Review by ''Empire''], accessed February 15, 2021.</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a C grade.<ref>[https://ew.com/article/1998/04/03/female-perversions/ Review by ''Entertainment Weekly''], accessed February 15, 2021.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Female Perversions}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1996 drama films]]\n[[Category:1996 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological drama films]]<!-- https://www.allmovie.com/movie/v135545 -->\n[[Category:American erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Female bisexuality in film]]\n[[Category:Films about lawyers]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:German erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:German LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:German psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
