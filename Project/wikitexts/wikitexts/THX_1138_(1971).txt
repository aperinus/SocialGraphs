It is set in a [[dystopia]]n future in which the populace is controlled through [[Android (robot)|android]] police and mandatory use of drugs that suppress emotions. Produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and written by Lucas and [[Walter Murch]], it stars [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Donald Pleasence]].\n\n''THX 1138'' was developed from Lucas's student film ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which he made in 1967 while attending the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. The feature film was produced in a joint venture between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[American Zoetrope]]. A novelization by [[Ben Bova]] was published in 1971.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box-office on initial release;<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gilbey|first=Ryan|title=It Don't Worry Me|publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref> however, the film has subsequently received critical acclaim and gained a [[cult following]], particularly in the aftermath of Lucas' success with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. A [[director's cut]] prepared by Lucas was released in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:THX 1138.jpg|thumb|The film's title-card]]\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn the future, [[sexual intercourse]] and [[reproduction]] are prohibited, whereas use of [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drugs]] is mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Emotions and the concept of family are [[taboo]]. Workers are clad in identical white uniforms and have shaven heads to emphasize uniformity, likewise with police [[android (robot)|android]]s who wear black and monks who are robed. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the \"prefix\") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.\n\nAt their jobs in central video <!-- CCTV --> control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX finishes his shift while the loudspeakers urge the workers to \"increase safety\"\u2014and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period\u2014to the competing factory's 242.\n\nOn the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and relates his concerns and mumbles prayers about \"party\" and \"masses\", under the [[Jesus Christ]]-esque portrait of \"OMM 0000\". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends the [[Confession (religion)|confession]] with a parting salutation: \"You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy.\"\n\nAt home, THX takes his drugs and watches [[Holography|holobroadcasts]] while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, causing him to develop nausea, anxiety, and sexual desires. LUH and THX become involved romantically and have sex. THX later is confronted by SEN, who attempts to arrange that THX become his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal shift pattern change.\n\nWithout drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a \"mind lock\" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested and THX undergoes drug therapy, and one of his kidneys is removed for donation purposes. He enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.\n\nAt THX's trial, it is stated that THX was clinically born. It is decided that it would be inefficient to terminate THX, so THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. The prison appears to be an all white space with no walls. One of the prisoners is a \"shell dweller\", later called a \"Wookiee\". The other prisoners seem uninterested in escape. THX and SEN walk to search for an exit. They walk and walk, with only a white space to be seen all around them. Eventually they are joined by [[Holography|hologram]] actor SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. SRT 5752 shows them the exit and suggests to them that they may have been going in circles. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been \"consumed\", and her name has been reassigned to her [[fetus]], numbered 66691, in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars. SRT struggles with figuring out how to drive the car. When SRT finally gets the car to move, SRT immediately crashes his car into a concrete pillar.\n\nPursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on the grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their allocated budget for THX. The guards inform THX that the surface is uninhabitable in a last-ditch attempt to convince him to surrender, but he is undeterred and continues up the ventilation shaft. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, and THX has escaped onto the surface, where he then witnesses the Sun setting.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Christ Giving His Blessing.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hans Memling]]'s ''Christ Giving His Blessing'' (1478) is used as the visual representation of the [[State religion|state-sanctioned]] [[deity]] OMM 0000.]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as THX 1138\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as SEN 5241\n* [[Maggie McOmie]] as LUH 3417\n* [[Don Pedro Colley]] as the hologram actor SRT 5752\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as the old prisoner PTO\n* [[Marshall Efron]] as prisoner TWA\n* [[Sid Haig]] as prisoner NCH\n* [[John Pearce (actor)|John Pearce]] as prisoner DWY\n* [[James Wheaton]] as the voice of OMM 0000\n\nAdditionally, amongst several 'announcer voices' were\n[[Scott Beach]], [[Terence McGovern]], and [[David Ogden Stiers ]] (billed as David Ogden Steers).

Stuntman Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton (credited as Duffy Hamilton) rode his police motorcycle full speed into a fallen paint stand, with a ramp built to Hambleton's specification. He flew over the handlebars, was hit by the airborne motorcycle, landed in the street on his back, and slammed into the crashed car in which Duvall's character had escaped.<ref name=ArtifactFromTheFuture /> According to Lucas, it turned out Hambleton was perfectly fine, apart from being angry with the people who had run into the shot to check on him.
