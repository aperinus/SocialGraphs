The film is set in the fictional town of Dante's Peak where the inhabitants fight to survive a [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruption]] from a long dormant [[stratovolcano]] that has suddenly woken up. The film was released on February 7, 1997, under the production of [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Valhalla Entertainment|Pacific Western Productions]]. It received negative reviews from critics and became an average success. Nevertheless, it has since gained a [[cult following]] among disaster film aficionados. It was the last film in which Charles Hallahan starred before his death nine months later in November 1997.\n\nIt is the third film collaboration between [[Gale Anne Hurd]] and Hamilton, who both previously worked in the [[The Terminator|first]] [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|two]] ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[volcanologist]] Harry Dalton and his partner-turned-fianc\u00e9e Marianne attempt to escape an ongoing [[Galeras tragedy|eruption]] in [[Colombia]]. As they venture out, a piece of debris smashes through the roof of the truck, killing Marianne.\n\nFour years later, Harry is assigned by his superior Dr. Paul Dreyfus to investigate seismic activity near the town of Dante's Peak, [[Washington (state)|Washington]], a town that borders a [[Volcano|dormant]] [[stratovolcano]]. Harry arrives and meets Mayor Rachel Wando with her children Graham and Lauren. Rachel offers to take Harry with them as they see her former mother-in-law Ruth Wando, an elderly hermit who lives near the lake at the base of the volcano. While exploring, they find dead trees, dead [[squirrel]]s, and two people scalded to death in a [[hot spring]]. Harry instructs Paul to bring a USGS team to monitor the volcano, but their initial survey finds no indications of volcanic activity. Paul advises against Harry putting the town on alert. Still, Harry tries to convince Rachel to prepare for a disaster, while developing a relationship with her and the children.\n\nOne day, Harry and his co-worker Terry examine the summit's crater until a rock slide traps Terry, causing him to suffer a broken leg. Both men are rescued by a helicopter. Days go by showing no signs of any threat or activity. Paul decides that no danger is imminent and the USGS team begins preparing to leave. When Harry goes to say goodbye to Rachel, they discover that the town's water supply has been contaminated with sulfur dioxide. The next morning, seismic readings and gas levels rise dramatically. Finally convinced that the volcano will erupt, and with the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] unavailable until the next day, Paul gives Harry permission to put the town on alert.\n\nAs a town meeting takes place at the high school, an earthquake strikes, and the eruption begins. Harry and Rachel go to retrieve the children, only to discover that they have gone to get Ruth, who refused to leave her home. Just as they reach Ruth and the children, a [[Lava|lava flow]] engulfs Ruth's cabin and destroys the vehicles both parties used to get there. The five flee across the lake in a motorboat, but the lake has become acidic due to sulfur-rich gases emitted from the volcano dissolving in the water to form [[sulfuric acid]], destroying the motor and eating away at the boat. Ruth jumps out of the boat to help it to shore, suffering severe chemical burns and eventually dying. Harry and the Wandos take a [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service ranger's]] truck to continue down the mountain and save Ruth's dog Roughy as they cross a lava flow in their path.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Guard helps the USGS team evacuate. As they leave, a [[lahar]] created by the melting glacier breaks the upstream dam. While the rest of the team gets across, Paul and his van fails to clear the bridge before it is washed away by the flood, throwing Paul overboard to his death. Harry and the Wandos arrive at the remains of the town. Harry retrieves a [[Emergency locator beacon|distress radiobeacon]] from the USGS equipment and learns that the volcano is due for one last eruption. Moments later, the volcano violently rips itself apart in a massive [[lateral blast]], triggering a [[pyroclastic flow]] which obliterates everything in its path within seconds. With no way out of town, Harry and the Wandos reach a mine, where Graham likes to hang out. The USGS team, watching the eruption from afar, presume Harry to be dead. Inside the mine, Harry realizes that he left the beacon in the truck. When he goes back for it, aftershocks cause rocks and debris to fall. Harry suffers a broken arm and is trapped in the truck, but is able to activate the beacon.\n\nDays later, Terry notices that the beacon has been activated, and the USGS dispatches search and rescue teams. Harry and the Wandos are freed from the mine, reunited with Harry's team, and airlifted out by helicopter. As the [[Closing credits|credits]] roll, the camera pans over the obliterated town and turns to the volcano, with its upper half now reduced to a [[Mount St. Helens]] like [[caldera]] and the tense music suggests that the volcano may erupt again at some point in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Harry Dalton, a volcanologist for the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]].\n* [[Linda Hamilton]] as Rachel Wando, the Mayor of Dante's Peak who also runs a coffeeshop\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] as Paul Dreyfus, Harry's superior.\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as Greg, a member of the USGS.\n* [[Elizabeth Hoffman (actress)|Elizabeth Hoffman]] as Ruth, the former mother-in-law of Rachel.\n* [[Jeremy Foley (actor)|Jeremy Foley]] as Graham Wando, the son of Rachel.\n* [[Jamie Ren\u00e9e Smith]] as Lauren Wando, the daughter of Rachel and the sister of Graham.\n* [[Arabella Field]] as Nancy, a member of the USGS.\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Stan, a member of the USGS.\n* Brian Reddy as Les Worrell, banker and Dante's Peak City Councilman.\n* Kirk Trutner as Terry Furlong, a member of the USGS.\n* [[Jeffrey L.
