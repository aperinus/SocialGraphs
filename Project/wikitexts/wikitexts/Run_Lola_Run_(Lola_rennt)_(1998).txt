The story follows a woman named Lola ([[Franka Potente]]) who needs to obtain 100,000 [[Deutsche Mark|Deutschmarks]] in twenty minutes to save the life of her boyfriend Manni ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]).\n\n''Run Lola Run'' screened at the [[Venice Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Golden Lion]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Following its release, the film received critical acclaim and several accolades, including the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics)|Grand Prix]] of the [[Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics]], the Audience Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Best Film at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and seven awards at the [[German Film Awards]]. It was also selected as the German entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[71st Academy Awards]], though it was not ultimately nominated.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"71stSubmissions\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Run Lola Run apartment.jpg|thumb|The house in Albrechtstra\u00dfe (Berlin-[[Mitte]]) where the three episodes begin]]\nManni, a [[bagman]] responsible for delivering 100,000 [[Deutsche Mark|Deutschmarks]], <!-- This article is in English, not German. Mark is not capitalized and its plural is marks. --> frantically calls his girlfriend Lola. Over the phone, Manni explains that he was riding the [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] to drop off the money and fled upon seeing ticket inspectors, before realizing that he had left the money bag behind; he saw a homeless man examining it as the train pulled away. Manni's boss Ronnie will kill him in 20 minutes unless he has the money, so he is preparing to rob a nearby {{ill|Bolle (supermarket)|de|Bolle (Supermarkt)|lt=Bolle}} supermarket to replace the funds. Lola implores Manni to wait for her and decides to ask her father, a bank manager, for help.\n\nLola hangs up and runs down the staircase of her apartment building past a man with a dog. At the bank, her father is having a conversation with his mistress, who discloses her pregnancy. When Lola arrives, her conversation with her father turns into an argument. He tells her that he is leaving her mother and that Lola is not his biological daughter. Lola runs to meet Manni but arrives too late and sees him entering the supermarket with a gun. She helps him rob it of 100,000 marks, but on leaving, they find it surrounded by police. Surrendering, Manni throws the money bag into the air, which startles a police officer who accidentally shoots Lola dead.\n\nEvents restart from the moment Lola leaves the house. This time, she trips over the man with the dog and now runs with a limp, so she subsequently arrives late to the bank, allowing her father's mistress to add that he is not the father of her unborn child. A furious Lola overhears the conversation, grabs a security guard's gun, holds her father hostage, and robs the bank of 100,000 marks. When police mistake her for a bystander, she is able to leave and meet with Manni in time, but a speeding ambulance that Lola had distracted moments earlier fatally runs him over.\n\nEvents restart once more. This time, Lola leaps over the man and his dog, arriving at the bank earlier but not triggering an auto accident as she did the first two times. Consequently, her father's colleague arrives before her and takes him away from the office. Lola now wanders aimlessly before entering a [[casino]], where she hands over all her cash and plays [[roulette]] with a single 100-mark chip. She bets it on the number 20, which wins. Roulette pays 35 to 1, so she wins 3,500 more marks, which she immediately adds to her original chip on 20. She now shrilly screams, causing 20 to come up again. She leaves with a bag containing 129,600 marks, and runs to Manni's rendezvous point. Meanwhile, Manni spots the homeless man from the subway passing by on a bicycle with the money bag. Manni steals back the bag at gunpoint, exchanging his gun. A dishevelled and perspiring Lola arrives to witness Manni handing off the money to Ronnie. As the pair walk along, Manni casually asks Lola about her bag.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Franka Potente]] as Lola\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Manni\n* [[Herbert Knaup]] as Lola's dad\n* [[Nina Petri]] as Frau Hansen\n* [[Armin Rohde]] as Herr Schuster\n* [[Joachim Kr\u00f3l]] as Norbert von Au\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as Herr Meier\n* [[Suzanne von Borsody]] as Frau J\u00e4ger\n* [[Sebastian Schipper]] as Mike\n* Julia Lindig as Doris\n* [[Lars Rudolph]] as Herr Kruse\n* Ute Lubosch as Mama\n* [[Monica Bleibtreu]] as the blind woman\n* [[Heino Ferch]] as Ronnie\n* [[Hans Paetsch]] as Narrator\n\n==Themes==\nThe film touches on themes such as [[free will]] vs. [[determinism]], the role of [[randomness|chance]] in people's destiny, and obscure cause-effect relationships. Through brief [[flashforward|flash-forward]] sequences of still images, Lola's fleeting interactions with bystanders are revealed to have surprising and drastic effects on their future lives, serving as concise illustrations of [[chaos theory]]'s [[butterfly effect]], in which minor, seemingly inconsequential variations in any interaction can blossom into much wider results than is often recognized. The film's exploration of the relationship between chance and conscious intention comes to the foreground in the casino scene, where Lola appears to defy the laws of chance through sheer force of will, improbably making the roulette ball land on her winning number with the help of a glass-shattering scream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slamdunkstudios.webs.com/apps/blog/show/22844572-run-lola-run-film-essay|title=Run Lola Run (film essay)|first=Duncan|last=Hubber|publisher=Slam Dunk Studios|date=13 May 2010|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-does-run-lola-run-demonstrate-chaos-theorys-butterfly-effect|title=How does \"Run Lola Run\" demonstrate chaos theory's butterfly effect?|first=Jeff|last=Saporito|publisher=Screen Prism|date=8 June 2015|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe thematic exploration of free will vs. determinism is made clear from the start. In the film's brief prologue, an unseen narrator asks a series of rhetorical questions that prime the audience to view the film through a metaphysical lens touching on traditional philosophical questions involving determinism vs. [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|philosophic libertarianism]], as well as [[epistemology]]. The theme is reinforced through the repeated appearance of a blind woman who briefly interacts with Manni in each alternative reality, and seems to have supernatural understandings of both the present and potential futures in those realities. The film ultimately seems to favor a [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] philosophical view to the free will question as evidenced by the casino scene and by the final telephone booth scene in which the blind woman redirects Manni's attention to a passerby, which enables him to make an important choice near the film's climax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~prasanna/dmc/chance.html#runlolarun|title=Chance, chaos and coincidence|first=Prasanna|last=Ganesan|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSeveral moments in the film allude to a supernatural awareness of the characters. For example, in the first reality, Manni shows a nervous Lola how to use a gun by removing the safety, while in the second timeline she removes the safety as though she remembers what to do. This suggests that she might have the memory of the events depicted in the previous timeline. Also, the bank's guard says to Lola \"you finally came\" in the third timeline, as if he remembered Lola's appearances in the previous two.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewessays.com/English/Run-Lola-Run/54320.html|title=Run Lola Run|publisher=Review Essays|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://joshepq.blogspot.com/2012/12/summary-run-lola-run-lola-rrent.html|title=Summary &mdash; Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt)|first=Joshua|last=Milton|date=6 December 2012|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe theme of desire is expressed through the film as a driving force for Lola's actions. In Ingebord Majer O'Sickey's essay \"Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets (Or Does She?): Time and Desire in Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run\" she argues that \"what Lola really wants is to get into time sync with Manni in sexual terms\". The conflict in the plot is driven by the initial phone conversation following Lola being late, leading to their timing to be out of sync. After the end of the first \"episode\", the bedside questioning by Lola reveals her dissatisfaction with the relationship, leading Manni to ask \"Do you want to leave me?\". O'Sickey makes the argument that each repeated return to the day is driven by Lola's continual attempt to adjust Manni's timing. The entirety of the film portrays Lola as \"postmodern heroine who could leap over traditional time-constraints\" giving the expectation that she ultimately would get what she wants. By the third arrival in the film, O'Sickey argues that \"Lola not only loses her super heroine status, but her desire to desire\". She claims the ending portrays \"the tradition of classical Hollywood cinema's economy of desire\". With Manni having reacquired the money, Lola's desire to be \"in sync\" disappears as she watches Manni's \"metamorphosis from a bungling and fairly ineffective lover to a man in control of the situation\". O'Sickey makes the claim that this deflates Lola's heroine status in the final act.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10509200214827|title=Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets (Or Does She?): Time and Desire in Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run|first=Ingeborg|last=O'Sickey|journal=Quarterly Review of Film and Video|date=27 October 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=123\u2013131|doi=10.1080/10509200214827|s2cid=192177461|access-date=25 April 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Allusions to earlier films==\nThe film has drawn numerous comparisons to [[Poland|Polish]] director [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]'s ''[[Blind Chance]]'' (1982), which also features three scenarios, the outcome of which depends on split-second timing.<ref name = \"D'Angelo\">{{cite web | first=Mike |last=D'Angelo | title= It's like Sliding Doors, only political and made by the director of ''Three Colors'' | website= [[The A.V.

Like that film, it features recurring images of [[spiral]]s, such as the Spirale bar behind Manni's phone box, the spiral staircase down which Lola runs and the spirals on the bedsheet. In addition, the painting on the back wall of the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in ''Vertigo'': Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of [[Kim Novak]] as she appeared in ''Vertigo''. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete.<ref>Tom Tykwer, commentary on the DVD edition of the film.</ref> The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.lafayette.edu/fams202-sp15/2015/02/04/run-lola-run-and-vertigo/|title=Run Lola Run and Vertigo|first=Jessica|last=Lewy|publisher=Lafayette College|date=4 February 2015|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Lola character is often compared to the [[Lara Croft]] character of the 1996 video game [[Tomb Raider]].<ref name=\"Mann\">{{cite web |title=Play Lara Play, Run Lola Run: Reflections on Postmodern Comic Book and Video Game Culture |date=2022-06-03 |author-first=Douglas |author-last=Mann |url=https://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/laralola.htm |access-date=2022-06-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127012442/http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/laralola.htm |archive-date=2020-11-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Jekubzik\">{{cite web |title=Lola rennt |language=de |author-first=G\u00fcnter H. |author-last=Jekubzik |url=http://www.filmtabs.de/archiv/L/Lola%20rennt.html |access-date=2022-06-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514093803/https://www.filmtabs.de/archiv/L/Lola%20rennt.html |archive-date=2021-05-14}}</ref><ref name=\"Mesch_2000\">{{cite journal |title=Racing Berlin - The Games of Run Lola Run |author-first=Claudia |author-last=Mesch |date=2000 |volume=3 |number=3 |doi=10.5204/mcj.1845 |journal=M/C Journal |issn=1441-2616 |url=https://journal.media-culture.org.au/mcjournal/article/view/1845 |access-date=2022-06-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220603173118/https://journal.media-culture.org.au/mcjournal/article/view/1845 |archive-date=2022-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Interviews, Reviews & Analysis: Run Lola Run |language=de |author-first= |author-last= |date= |work=Puzzle Films |url=https://filmstudiesju.wordpress.com/interviews-reviews-analysis-run-lola-run/ |access-date=2022-06-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220603172008/https://filmstudiesju.wordpress.com/interviews-reviews-analysis-run-lola-run/ |archive-date=2022-06-03}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodward_2009\">{{cite book |title=After Kie\u015blowski |chapter=7.

In the original work, the chords are meant to represent \"the Silences of the [[Druid]]s\u2014who Know, See and Hear Nothing.\"\n\nThe techno soundtrack established ''[[dialectical]] relation'' between motives of the movie: ''Rhythm'', ''Repetition'', and ''Interval'' among various spatio-temporal logics.
