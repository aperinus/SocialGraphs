He spontaneously arranges a bucket collection for the miners during the [[Pride London|Gay Pride Parade in London]]. Encouraged by the success, he founds \"[[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]]\". Among its first members are 20-year-old closeted student Joe Cooper and an older gay couple Gethin and [[Jonathan Blake (activist)|Jonathan]], whose bookshop (called [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Gay's the Word]]) they use as headquarters.\n\nLGSM faces opposition from the mining community who do not wish to associate with them, as well as within the gay community who feel that the miners have mistreated them in the past. Frustrated by the lack of response, the activists instead decide to take their donations directly to a small mining village named {{lang|cy|[[Onllwyn]]|italic=no}} in [[Wales]]. Dai Donovan, spokesperson for the miners in {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}}, comes to London to meet their new allies. Though he is startled by the revelation of what \"L\" and \"G\" stand for in their name, he expresses his gratitude in a short, eloquent speech at a gay bar, and the cause takes off.\n\nIn {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}}, the Women's Support group, led by [[Hefina Headon]] and Maureen Barry, debate whether to invite LGSM to the village as a thank you; Hefina, and her supporters, favour gratitude from all camps, whilst Maureen's supporters consider the gays abhorrent. First-time volunteer [[Si\u00e2n James (politician)|Si\u00e2n James]] speaks up fiercely in favour of inviting LGSM and is asked to join the committee. \n\nWhen LGSM arrives in {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}}, they are met with a frosty reception and Maureen leads a walkout after Mark's speech to the village. However, the next day Jonathan shares with {{lang|cy|Si\u00e2n|italic=no}} his knowledge of harassment laws and abuse of police power; the fiery {{lang|cy|Si\u00e2n|italic=no}} marches down to the police station to demand the release of illegally-detained miners. \n\nMany grateful miners acknowledge LGSM's role in their release, relations begin to thaw and the two communities quickly become close. Finding herself on the outside, Maureen contacts a tabloid about the situation in {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}}. The resulting story humiliates The National Union of Miners, who call a vote on whether to accept LGSM's support.\n\nBack in London, Mark declares that they will embrace the labels in the tabloid and throws an enormous concert at the [[Electric Ballroom]] headlined by [[Bronski Beat]], attended by Dai, Hefina and a number of the women from the village. Mark is badly shaken when he encounters a former lover who implies that he is terminal with AIDS. The \"Pits and Perverts\" festival raises thousands of pounds for {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}}, but the Union vote moves forward three hours without notice, and without Dai or Hefina, Maureen's camp succeeds in voting to refuse further help from LGSM. \n\nDisillusioned and haunted, Mark abandons LGSM. Gethin, who initially refused to participate due to his own experience coming out in a mining village, attempts to campaign alone and is violently assaulted and hospitalised. \n\nJoe is outed when his parents find photos from {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}} and they keep him away from the group.\n\nIn March 1985, the Miners' Strike is over. The miners of {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}} gather to go back into the mines. Joe sees the news and sneaks off to {{lang|cy|Onllwyn|italic=no}} to show solidarity, where he encounters Mark. Mark confronts Joe about hiding his activism and homosexuality from his parents. When {{lang|cy|Si\u00e2n|italic=no}} drives him to London in the LGSM donated van, he learns of Gethin's condition Joe decides it's time to leave home and has her drive him directly up to his home, embarrassing his conservative mother.\n\nOn the day of the 1985 Gay Pride Parade, Mark returns to the group and apologises for abandoning the cause. He leads LGSM to the Parade, where they are joined by hundreds of miners in a show of solidarity. \n\nThe closing scenes reveal that consequently the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] incorporated rights for gays and lesbians in their party programme due in part to a massive vote lodged by the National Union of Mineworkers, that {{lang|cy|Si\u00e2n|italic=no}} was elected to Parliament, that Jonathan still lived (as of 2014) despite being one of first in Britain to be diagnosed with HIV, and that Mark Ashton died of AIDS just two years later at the age of 26.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin|colwidth=}}\n\n'''LGSM members'''\n* [[Ben Schnetzer]] as [[Mark Ashton]], founder of LGSM\n* [[Joseph Gilgun]] as Michael (Mike) Jackson, Mark's best friend.\n* [[Faye Marsay]] as Stephanie (Steph) Chambers, the sole lesbian among the LGSM founders.\n* [[Dominic West]] as [[Jonathan Blake (activist)|Jonathan Blake]], Gethin's partner and the second person diagnosed with HIV in the UK.\n* [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Gethin Roberts, Jonathan's partner and a Welshman who was alienated from his village when he came out sixteen years earlier\n* [[Freddie Fox (actor)|Freddie Fox]] as Jeff Cole, popular with the Onllwyn children.\n* [[Chris Overton]] as Reggie Blennerhassett, Ray's partner.\n* Joshua Hill as Ray Aller, Reggie's partner.\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Joe \"[[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]]\" Cooper, a fictional LGSM member.\n\n'''Women's Support Group members'''\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[Hefina Headon]], member of the strike committee.\n* [[Jessica Gunning]] as [[Si\u00e2n James (politician)|Si\u00e2n James]], wife of Martin.\n* [[Liz White (actress)|Liz White]] as Margaret Donovan, member of the strike committee and wife of Dai\n* Nia Gwynne as Gail Pritchard, wife of Alan.\n* Menna Trussler as Gwen, an elderly member, and widow of William, who was a miner.\n* [[Lisa Palfrey]] as Maureen Barry, a widow and sister-in-law of Cliff who is against LGSM support.\n\n'''Other characters'''\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Cliff Barry, a leader of the men's union.\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as David (Dai) Donovan, a leader of the men's union and member of the strike committee\n* [[Rhodri Meilir]] as Martin James, a leader of the men's union.\n* [[Sophie Evans (performer)|Sophie Evans]] as Debbie Thomas.\n* [[Karina Fernandez]] as Stella, an LGSM member who broke off to form an all-female group [[Lesbians Against Pit Closures]].\n* [[Jessie Cave]] as Zoe, Stella's girlfriend.\n* [[Monica Dolan]] as Marion Cooper, Bromley's mother.\n* Matthew Flynn as Tony Cooper, Bromley's father.\n* Olwen Medi as Gethin's mother, who initially disowned him for being gay.\n* [[Kyle Rees]] as Carl Evans, a miner who asks Jonathan for dancing lessons.\n* Jack Baggs as Gary, Carl's friend who also asks for dance lessons.\n* Jams Thomas as the Miners Union Leader.\n* [[Deddie Davies]] as The Old Lady at Bingo.\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Tim, apparent ex lover of Mark.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Cinema release===\n''Pride'' premiered at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], where it received a [[standing ovation]] and won the [[Queer Palm]] award.<ref name=\"Cannes ES\">{{cite news|last=Roddick|first=Nick|title=Pride -
