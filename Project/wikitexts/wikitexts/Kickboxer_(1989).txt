Former world kickboxing champion [[Dennis Alexio]] is also featured. It spawned several [[Kickboxer (film series)|sequels]].\n\n==Plot==\nKurt Sloane is the younger brother and [[cornerman]] of Eric Sloane, the United States kickboxing world champion. After another successful title defense, Eric is enticed by the media to compete in Thailand, where kickboxing was started, to further establish his legacy. As a result, Eric and Kurt travel to [[Bangkok]] to fight Tong \"The Tiger\" Po, Thailand's undefeated top fighter. Eric is supremely confident, but Kurt becomes apprehensive after witnessing Tong Po kicking a concrete pillar in preparation for the fight. He begs Eric not to fight, but Eric dismisses any concerns.\n\nTong Po dominates Eric in the first round with his superior strength and knowledge of Thailand's unorthodox kickboxing rules. In between rounds, Kurt once again begs Eric to stop, but Eric refuses to give up, and gets beaten badly in the second round. Kurt [[Submission (combat sports)|throws in the towel]], but Tong Po kicks the towel out of the ring, and continues his assault. He viciously strikes Eric in the back with his elbow, immobilizing him, and then rips apart Eric's world championship belt. Kurt retrieves the belt, and leaves with his brother on a stretcher, but the fight officials leave them on the street. Winston Taylor, a retired [[United States Army Special Forces]] member, agrees to help the pair by driving them to the hospital. As a result of Tong Po's brutal attack, Eric is paralyzed from the waist down and will never be able to walk again.\n\nAn enraged Kurt vows to avenge his brother. He searches for a trainer to teach him [[Muay Thai]], but is mocked and laughed out of the gym by the local fighters. Eventually, Taylor tells him about Xian Chow, a famous Muay Thai Kru living in a remote area of Thailand. Before introducing him to Xian, Taylor insists that Kurt goes drinking with him. During their time at a [[go-go bar]], Taylor confides in Kurt by implying that he left a friend to die during the [[Vietnam War]], so he feels that he owes it to his memory to help Kurt.\n\nAlthough reluctant at first, Xian agrees to train Kurt after having him retrieve groceries from his niece, Mylee. While at her store, Kurt prevents goons sent by Freddy Li - a higher up in a racketeering organization and Tong Po's manager - from stealing money from Mylee. While training, Kurt drunkenly beats up some of Freddy Li's thugs in a bar fight that was orchestrated by Xian, who convinces Freddy Li to arrange a preliminary match between Kurt and another young fighter. Kurt is victorious and earns a match against Tong Po. It is determined that they will fight in the \"ancient way\": both fighters wrap their hands in hemp rope, which is then coated in resin, and dipped in broken glass to make them deadly weapons.\n\nFreddy Li arranges to have the fight fixed, and borrows $1&nbsp;million from the Thai crime syndicate's boss Tao Liu in order to bet on Tong Po. Several days prior to the match, Mylee is beaten and raped by Tong Po, while Eric is kidnapped so that Freddy Li can blackmail Kurt into losing the fight. Xian's dog Kiki is also stabbed during the ambush. As Taylor prepares to take Kiki to town for treatment, Mylee confesses to him about her rape and reveals she has not told Kurt, insisting that his mind must be clear for the fight with Tong Po. To that end, she begs Taylor to help find Eric, but he is reluctant to cross Freddy Li.\n\nTo save his brother's life, Kurt is instructed by Freddy Li to go the distance with Tong Po before losing the match. He endures a torturous beating, but Xian and Taylor manage to locate Eric and rescue him. Before the final round, Eric arrives with Xian and Taylor. He whistles from the crowd and gives Kurt a thumbs-up before starting a chant of \"Nack Suk Cao\" (white warrior). With Eric now out of danger, Kurt has Mylee cut the hemp rope from his hands before pummeling Tong Po viciously, finally defeating him. After kicking Freddy Li in the face for good measure, Kurt celebrates his victory with his brother and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Kurt Sloane\n* [[Dennis Alexio]] as Eric Sloane\n* Dennis Chan as Xian Chow, Muay Thai Kru\n* [[Michel Qissi]] as Tong \"The Tiger\" Po\n* Ka Ting Lee as Freddy Li\n* Rochelle Ashana as Mylee\n* [[Haskell V.

The score for the film was composed by [[Paul Hertzog]]. The full score was remastered and released in 2006 by Perseverance Records in limited quantity.\n\nThe 2006 official score release does not include a previously released version of the score track titled \"Buddha's Eagle\" which was released on the ''Best of Van Damme Volume 2 Compilation'' CD.\n\nAn expanded version of the 2006 album was released by [[Perseverance Records]] in July 2014. This album contained the remastered original 22 tracks plus 9 vocal performances that previously had only been available in Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nKickboxer was first released on VHS by [[HBO Video]] in 1990. DVD was released by HBO Home Video in the United States on June 8, 1999. The DVD was released by Prism Leisure Corporation in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2003.\n\n====Alternate versions====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThe most complete version of this film ever released was the R18+ Australian/New Zealand VHS video release by Palace Entertainment and The Movie Group. This version contained all of the original voice dubs and was fully uncut in terms of violence but had a few scenes trimmed due to print damage and the last fight was incorrectly edited at one point. This was first packaged as a rental in a double pack with another Van Damme film, Wrong Bet (Lionheart). While 1 minute 18 seconds of violence was trimmed by the BBFC in the UK VHS versions by 4Front/EIV video, the print damaged scenes and the final fight editing mistake had been rectified in this version. The UK versions had better picture quality and were brightened in colour compared to the darker Australian/New Zealand Palace R18+/M15+ releases.\n\nAny other versions of the film that came out after the initial VHS releases were a heavily edited and re-dubbed version. Every version of the film released after 1995 on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray contain this inferior edited version. Certain scenes were cut altogether, some scenes re-edited as well as character lines and voices changed. Eric (Dennis Alexio)'s voice was re-dubbed, along with certain scenes of Van Damme and Michel Qissi (Tong Po).\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Kickboxer'' grossed $14,697,005 in the United States.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=''Kickboxer'' (1989)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kickboxer.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=September 24, 2013}}</ref> Cannon deliberately released it on the traditionally slow weekend after Labor Day when no studio releases, and thus limited competition; it opened on 973 screens and grossed $4.1&nbsp;million, making it the third most popular film in the country.<ref>{{cite web|author=DANIEL CERONE |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-15/entertainment/ca-315_1_independent-film |title=Independent Film Makers, Marketers Confront Box-Office Crisis - latimes |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=1997-01-24 |access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref> A few years later its gross was estimated at $50&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news | first=Martha | last=Sherrill  | title= The muscles from brussels | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=August 11, 1991}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nChris Willman of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film \"egregiously dull\" and a contender for one of \"the dumbest action pictures of the year\", citing its \"jarring shifts in tone, insurmountable plot implausibilities, rampant racial stereotyping, superfluous nudity and inhuman amounts of comically exaggerated violence\". Willman also questioned the manner in which characters seem to recover from serious injuries and major trauma.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Kickboxer' Takes a Giant Step Backwards |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1989-09-11|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-11/entertainment/ca-1390_1_van-damme| first=Chris |last=Willman}}</ref>\n\nChris Hicks of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' criticized the film as a ripoff of ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', with added elements from other films such as ''[[Rocky]]'' and ''[[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]''. In addition to stating that the ending was predictable, Hicks also dismissed Van Damme as \"little more than a low-budget [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] wannabee\" whose attempts at acting were in vain.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hicks |first= Chris|title=Film review: Kickboxer|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=October 5, 1989|url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000943/Kickboxer.html}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 36% based on reviews from 11 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= Kickboxer |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1011487-kickboxer/ |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 33% based on reviews from 4 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= Kickboxer |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kickboxer |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n===Sequels===\n{{Main|Kickboxer 2|Kickboxer 3|Kickboxer 4|Redemption: Kickboxer 5}}\nThe film spawned several sequels. Despite Van Damme not returning, the film series between parts two and four continues the ongoing battles between the Sloane family (although now spelled Sloan) - expanded to include third brother David Sloan(e), played by [[Sasha Mitchell]] - and Tong Po.\nMichel Qissi returned as Tong Po for ''Kickboxer 2: The Road Back'' and appears in a flashback scene shown at the beginning of ''Kickboxer 4: The Agressor''. This scene looks to be a seemingly deleted scene from ''Kickboxer 2'' that never made the final cut.\nTong Po was played by Kamel Krifa in ''Kickboxer 4''.\n''Kickboxer 5: The Redemption'' was a stand-alone story with new characters and has a small connection to the previous films.\n\n===Reboot===\n{{main|Kickboxer: Vengeance}}\n''Kickboxer'' was remade as ''Kickboxer: Vengeance'', as a reboot of the series which was released on September 2, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jean-claude-van-damme-returning-752966|title=Jean-Claude van Damme returning to 'Kickboxer' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 1, 2014|access-date=December 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wood |first=Matt |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1535159/the-kickboxer-vengeance-trailer-is-brutal-and-thrilling-watch-it-now |title=The Kickboxer: Vengeance trailer is brutal and thrilling, watch it now |website=Cinemablend.com |date=2016-07-16 |access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|97659}}\n* {{mojo title|kickboxer}}\n* [http://www.jeanclaudevandamme.fr/film/kickboxer.php Kickboxer on Jeanclaudevandamme.fr] {{in lang|fr}}\n\n{{Jean-Claude Van Damme}}\n{{Kickboxer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kickboxer (Film)}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:American martial arts films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:Films set in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Van Damme]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Kickboxer (film series)]]\n[[Category:Muay Thai films]]\n[[Category:American Muay Thai films]]\n[[Category:American rape and revenge films]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Worth (cinematographer)]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]"}]}}}}
