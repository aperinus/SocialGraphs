It is a credited [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era [[Texas]], a wanderer named John Smith ([[Bruce Willis]]) drives his [[Ford Model A (1927\u201331)|Ford Model A Coupe]] into the small [[Mexican border|bordertown]] of Jericho. As he arrives, a young woman named Felina ([[Karina Lombard]]) crosses the street, catching Smith's eye. Moments later, a group of [[Irish mob]]sters, led by Finn ([[Patrick Kilpatrick]]), surround Smith's car. They warn him against staring at \"Doyle's property\" and smash up his car.\n\nStranded and with no money to get his car fixed, Smith goes to see Sheriff Ed Galt ([[Bruce Dern]]); the cowardly Galt refuses to help him. Instead, Smith walks to the town hotel, run by Joe Monday ([[William Sanderson]]), gets a drink and a room, and arms himself. He then goes to Doyle's headquarters and challenges Finn to a [[Fast draw|duel]], which Smith wins with alarming speed. Smith departs and returns to the hotel bar, much to the surprise of Jericho's residents.\n\nLearning of Finn's death, Fredo Strozzi ([[Ned Eisenberg]]), the head of Jericho's [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian gang]], offers Smith a job in his outfit. Strozzi is eager to wipe out his rivals, and is hiring anyone who can fight to build up his gang. Smith agrees to his offer and meets Giorgio Carmonte ([[Michael Imperioli]]), son of a prominent [[Chicago Outfit|Chicago mobster]] who is monitoring Strozzi's activities in Jericho. Carmonte expresses his immediate distrust and dislike of Smith, who leaves, and meets and seduces Strozzi's mistress, Lucy ([[Alexandra Powers]]).\n\nSmith accompanies Strozzi and his men to a backcountry road, where they meet Ramirez, a corrupt Mexican police official on Doyle's payroll. The gang ambushes and kills Doyle's men and seizes a caravan of illicit liquor. Carmonte travels to Mexico to cut more deals with Ramirez, while Doyle ([[David Patrick Kelly]]) and his chief enforcer, Hickey ([[Christopher Walken]]) return to Jericho and are informed of Finn's death and the loss of the shipment. Smith defects to Doyle's side and reveals Ramirez's betrayal. Hickey travels to Mexico, kills Ramirez and a corrupt [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] officer involved in the liquor trade, and kidnaps Carmonte. Doyle contacts Strozzi and demands a large ransom for Carmonte, as well as the return of his trucks. Strozzi in turn kidnaps Felina and offers to trade her instead. The two gangs make the exchange and return to their respective empires.\n\nSmith is summoned by Sheriff Galt and meets Captain Tom Pickett ([[Ken Jenkins]]) of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], who has been sent to investigate the Patrol officer's death. He warns Smith that he can tolerate one gang in Jericho, but not two, and intends to bring a company of Rangers in ten days to wipe out both sides if one isn't destroyed. As Smith leaves, Pickett warns him that if he finds him there after ten days, he'll kill him as well.\n\nLucy comes to Smith and reveals that Strozzi had her ear cut off for sleeping with him. Smith gives her some money and puts her on a bus out of Jericho. The next day, Smith relays a false rumor that Strozzi is bringing in more soldiers. Playing on Doyle's obsession with Felina, he convinces Doyle that Strozzi will try to kidnap her again to learn where Felina is being kept. Smith kills the men guarding Felina and gives her one of Doyle's cars and some money. The next day, Smith is waiting at the safehouse when Doyle arrives, and claims that he arrived too late to keep Strozzi from kidnapping Felina. Doyle's henchman Jack McCool ([[R. D. Call]]) believes Smith's story, but Hickey does not. Doyle goes berserk and declares all-out war on Strozzi and his gang.\n\nSmith's plan goes awry when Hickey ambushes him, having received word that Felina was spotted heading towards [[Mexico]]. Doyle imprisons Smith and has him tortured, demanding to know where Felina is. Despite the heavy torture inflicted on him, Smith refuses to talk. Later that night, he overpowers his guards and escapes with Monday and Sheriff Galt. As they are driving out of town, they see Hickey and his men slaughtering Strozzi's gang at a roadhouse. Strozzi and Carmonte try to surrender, but are gunned down without mercy.\n\nSmith takes refuge at a remote church where Felina went to pray. Two days later, Sheriff Galt arrives and informs Smith that Monday was caught smuggling food and water to the church and that Doyle will probably torture him to death. He then hands Smith his pistols, saying that's all the help he's willing to offer. Smith returns to town, kills McCool and the rest of Doyle's men, and rescues Monday. Doyle and Hickey are absent, having gone down to Mexico in a desperate search for Felina. Smith lures Doyle to his location, and lets Monday take revenge by shooting the gangster with his revolver. Hickey pretends to surrender and tries to kill Smith, who outdraws and shoots him dead.\n\nIn the aftermath, Smith gets into his Ford and drives on to Mexico, his original destination.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as John Smith\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Sheriff Ed Galt\n* [[William Sanderson]] as Joe Monday\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Hickey\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Doyle\n* [[Karina Lombard]] as Felina\n* [[Ned Eisenberg]] as Fredo Strozzi\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Giorgio Carmonte\n* [[R.

Hill says, \"It took me a long time to be persuaded to do it. I thought the very idea of adapting Mr. Kurosawa was insanity for the obvious reasons. The first movie was very, very good and in addition I would be in the long shadow of Mr. Kurosawa who is probably our most revered filmmaker.\"<ref name=\"last\">{{cite news|title= Filmmaker Walter Hill has made some of ...|last=Portman|first= Jamie|newspaper= CanWest News|date=12 Sep 1996|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nWhen he learned that Kurosawa was supportive of an American remake, Hill agreed to write and direct\u2014but on the condition that the film not be a Western (there had already been an unauthorized European remake, the [[Spaghetti Western]] ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', which had been the subject of litigation). He decided to do it as a 1930s gangster film using techniques of 1940s [[film noir]].\n\n\"This is the story of a bad man, who as soon as he arrives begins pushing buttons and doing things only for himself\", said Hill. \"But we also discover that this man is at a point of spiritual crisis with himself and his own past. And this man decides that maybe he should do one good deed, even if it goes against all the rules of his life as he understands it ... The action and the violence must be organic to the story being told. I think this is obviously by its nature a very dark and very hard movie, so I think it would be dishonest to tell the story and present the physicality in a softer way. Besides, I don't think this is the most brutal film imaginable. There's actually very little blood other than in the sequence where Bruce gets beaten up.\"<ref name=\"last\"/>\n\nHe admitted the film was not realistic. \"I don't think anything akin to the [[social realism]] movies of the 1930s is being attempted\", he said. \"We're into a 'once upon a time' mythic-poetic situation.\"<ref name=\"last\"/>\n\nHill signed to make the project in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spike Lee to shoot from 3-point line|edition=City|author=Carr, Jay|work=Boston Globe|date=31 July 1994|page=B19}}</ref> The film was green lit by [[New Line Cinema]]'s head of production [[Michael De Luca]] who allocated a $40 million budget.<ref>{{cite news |title=With Hollywood Money, Trust Someone Under 30: Hollywood Money and Someone Under 30 |first=Bernard |last=Weinraub |work=New York Times |date=18 July 1995 |page=C13 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/18/movies/with-hollywood-money-trust-someone-under-30.html }}</ref> The film was known by several titles including \"Gundown\", then \"Gangster\", then \"Welcome to Jericho.\"\n\nHill later said that he and [[Bruce Willis]] \"were not close when we did the film\" but \"I liked working with him. It was impersonal. Classic, 'I know what you mean. You want me to be a [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]], [[Robert Mitchum|Mitchum]] kind of guy' and I said 'Exactly. Let it happen.' He then took that and gave what I thought was a very good performance. I always sensed there was a kind of core resentment that Bruce felt he should be more appreciated for his talents. At the same time I think there is a limitation, that he does certain things better than others, and he hasn't always chosen so wisely.\"<ref name=\"hill5\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dga.org/Craft/VisualHistory/Interviews/Walter-Hill.aspx|title=Walter Hill \u2013 Visual History Interview|website=Dga.org|access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHill's original cut of the movie was over two hours long. Before Hill edited the final theatrical version his rough cut was used to edit the trailers for the movie, which is why there is lot of alternate/deleted footage shown in them, including many alternate takes, different edits of some scenes, extended versions of scenes, some extra lines of dialogue, shots and parts of deleted scenes including additional shootout sequence between two gangs and alternate ending in which Hickey is killed by Smith in a different way. Some promotional stills and pictures also show several deleted scenes.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only a total $18,127,448 domestically by December 22, 1996, and brought in $47,267,001 worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 39% approval rating based on 31 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"''Last Man Standing'''s brooding atmosphere and bursts of artfully arranged action prove intriguing yet ultimately insufficient substitutes for a consistently compelling story.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1073075-last_man_standing/ |title=Last Man Standing |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=5 August 2022}}</ref> Common recurring complaints address the oppressive and depressing atmosphere of the film; the flat, almost monotonous personality of Willis' character between gunfights; and the film's [[Pyrrhic victory]] finale. Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one out of four stars, and wrote:\n\n<blockquote>''Last Man Standing'' is such a desperately cheerless film, so dry and laconic and wrung out, that you wonder if the filmmakers ever thought that in any way it could be ... fun. It contains elements that are often found in entertainments \u2014 things like guns, gangs and spectacular displays of death \u2014 but here they crouch on the screen and growl at the audience. Even the movie's hero is bad company. ... The victory at the end is downbeat, and there is an indifference to it.
