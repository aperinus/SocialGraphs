The film was produced by [[Jack Binder]], Alex Gartner and Sammy Lee, received mostly positive reviews with praise for Allen and Costner's performances, and was also a moderate box office success grossing $28.2 million from a $12 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nBeginning ''[[in medias res]]'', the opening scene presents Terry Wolfmeyer and her four daughters, with a friend, Denny Davies, attending a [[funeral]].\n\nAbout three years earlier, a flashback reveals, a heavily intoxicated Terry announces to her daughters Hadley, Andy, Emily and Popeye that their father, Grey, has left the family to be with his secretary in [[Sweden]]. \n\nTerry continues to drink heavily to cope with her anger and pain, which causes her daughters to resent her. She later shares the news about her husband with her neighbor Denny, a retired baseball player turned radio talk-show host and fellow heavy drinker. They progressively grow closer, and eventually begin an intimate relationship.\n\nKeen to help where he can, Denny helps Andy to become a production assistant at the radio station where he works. There she meets Shep, Denny's producer who is a questionable character in his 40s; Andy and Shep begin a relationship which disgusts and angers Terry. Andy does well at the radio station, and soon outgrows the relationship. \n\nMeanwhile Popeye, a high school student, pursues a romance with a classmate, but he reveals to her that he's gay. They instead become close friends, bonding over their respective broken homes.\n\nTerry clashes with Emily, who wants to pursue a career as a professional ballet dancer and rejects her mother's desire for her to go to a traditional university. Emily ultimately relents and starts classes at [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor, but is soon hospitalized for complications from an eating disorder. She returns home to recover and, after a night at the ballet with the entire family, Terry appears to accept Emily's desire to pursue dance.\n\nHadley graduates from college and immediately afterward tells her mother and sisters that she's pregnant and engaged to her longtime boyfriend, David. Terry reacts with anger that Hadley had not told her sooner or ever bothered to introduce her to David, leading to an embarrassing drunken scene at a lunch with David's parents.\n\nWhen Popeye asks Denny what his long-term intentions are concerning his relationship with her mother, he decides to broach the subject with Terry. He is hit with anger and accusations that he is trying to push her into a marriage for which she feels unready. Weary and tired of Terry's ever-shifting moods, Denny confronts her and then storms out of her house. After a brief separation, Terry finally acknowledges the depth of her feelings for him, and they reunite.\n\nWhen a real estate deal involving both Denny and Terry finally goes through, construction begins in the area surrounding their homes. A worker accidentally uncovers an abandoned, partially covered well, where Grey Wolfmeyer's body is found, revealing that he had never left his family. Rather, he had accidentally fallen in the well and died. Because Grey's secretary had abruptly returned to Sweden at the same time he disappeared, Terry believed he had run away with her.\n\nAs the story returns to the initial scene, the Wolfmeyers and Denny, now part of the family, leave Grey's [[funeral]] to reveal that Terry, while saddened and grieving, is coming to terms with her own and her daughters' life choices and, finally, finding some inner peace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Terry Wolfmeyer\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Denny Davies\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Hadley Wolfmeyer\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Emily Wolfmeyer\n* [[Erika Christensen]] as Andy Wolfmeyer\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Lavender \"Popeye\" Wolfmeyer\n* [[Mike Binder]] as Adam \"Shep\" Goodman\n* [[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]] as David Jr.\n* Sarah Coomes as Anna Holstein \n* Dane Christensen as Gorden Reiner\n* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] as Grey Wolfmeyer\n* Magdalena Manville as Darlene\n* [[Suzanne Bertish]] as Gina\n* [[David Firth (actor)|David Firth]] as David Sr.\n* Rod Woodruff as Dean Reiner\n* [[Stephen Greif]] as Emily's doctor\n* [[Arthur Penhallow]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\nMike Binder wrote the role of Terry specifically for Joan Allen, having befriended the actress after working with her on the film ''[[The Contender (2000 film)|The Contender]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clark |first=John |date=2005-03-13 |title=Quiet Star Gets Angry and Earthy |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/QUIET-STAR-GETS-ANGRY-AND-EARTHY-2723549.php |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Upside of Anger - Full Production Notes |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2005/anger.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528112334/http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2005/anger_production_details.htm |archive-date=2013-05-28 |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=Made in Atlantis}}</ref> According to Binder in the \"Making of\" featurette on the film's DVD, the script was rejected by several major studios due to the casting of Allen (which goes unexplained); he and his producer brother Jack Binder then sought independent financing and renegotiated compensation deals with talent in order to complete the film.<ref>[[Mike Binder|Binder, Mike]] et al. \"Creating the Upside of Anger.\" (Featurette) DVD.
