The film follows a photographer, George, and his family who experience the presence of a dark force in a cabin during their wintry weekend at upstate New York while being antagonized by a local hunter after accidentally hitting a deer on the road. Meanwhile, George's son, Miles, begins to have vivid hallucinations of the legendary [[Wendigo]], who he believes to be responsible for the dark forces\n\nThe film was released to theatres on January 23, 2001, for a limited time, and received mixed reviews by critics. The film was not a major box office attraction and bombed as it scored $1.1 thousand on opening weekend.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge ([[Jake Weber]]) is a highly-strung professional [[photographer]] who is starting to unravel from the stress of his work with a [[Manhattan]] advertising agency. Needing some time away from the city, his wife Kim ([[Patricia Clarkson]]), and their 10-year-old son Miles ([[Erik Per Sullivan]]) head to [[Upstate New York]] to take in the winter sights, though the drive up is hardly relaxing for any of them.\n\nGeorge accidentally hits and severely injures a [[deer]] that ran onto the icy road. After George stops to inspect the damage, he's confronted by an angry local named Otis who flies into a rage, telling George that he and his fellow [[hunter]]s had been tracking the deer for some time. An argument breaks out, which leaves George feeling deeply shaken. When George and Kim arrive at their [[Log cabin|cabin]], they discover that a dark and intimidating presence seems to have taken it over.\n\nThe next day, when they stop at a store in a town near the cabin, a shopkeeper tells Miles about the legend of the [[Wendigo]], a deformed beast from [[Native America]]n [[folklore]] who changes from a human to a hideous beast after engaging in [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]]. The shopkeeper also tells him that the Wendigo also has supernatural powers and the ability to change its appearance at will. The shopkeeper then gives him a small figurine of a Wendigo. Miles can't help but think the Wendigo has something to do with the dark forces at work in the woods near the cabin.\n\nLater that day, while sledding together, George suddenly falls to the ground, leaving Miles alone and lost in the woods. Frightened, Miles approaches his dad when he is chased by the Wendigo and passes out. He is awakened later by a frightened Kim, who went looking for her family once they didn't come home.\n\nKim and Miles begin a trek deep into the forest, until they end up at the house, where they find a bloody George crawling towards the car claiming Otis shot him. Frantic, Kim and Miles put George in the car and drive to the nearest hospital. It is revealed that George and Miles were sledding near a shooting range and Otis shot George in the liver with a [[hunting rifle]]. George undergoes emergency surgery and Miles walks into the hospital, hallucinates that his father is being assaulted by the Wendigo and faints. He awakens only to find that George has died.\n\nOtis is confronted by the local [[sheriff]], but he kills the sheriff and drives away into the night, being stalked by the Wendigo until he crashes into a tree and runs away into the forest, eventually ending up on a road where he is hit by the deputy sheriff's squad car. The movie ends with Otis being carted into the emergency room of the hospital, and being followed by the Indian shopkeeper while Miles watches it all, caressing the Wendigo figurine.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Patricia Clarkson]] as Kim \n*[[Jake Weber]] as George \n*[[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Miles \n*John Speredakos as Otis \n*Christopher Wynkoop as Sheriff Tom Hale \n*Lloyd Oxendine as Elder \n*[[Brian Delate]] as Everett \n*[[Daniel Sherman (actor)|Daniel Stewart Sherman]] as Billy \n*Jennifer Wiltsie as Martha \n*Maxx Stratton as Brandon \n*Richard Stratton as Earl \n*Dash Stratton as Little Otis \n*Dwayne Navara as Mechanic \n*Shelly Bolding as Store Owner \n*Susan Pellegrino as Nurse \n*James Godwin as Wendigo\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in limited release, was not a major box office attraction, and only scored $1,107 at opening weekend.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by Live/Artisan on December 17, 2002.

The rampaging Wendigo may be a manifestation of Miles's incipient Oedipal rage, but at the same time it is a force embedded in nature and history. Such abstract notions may put off fans of the genre in its most elemental, slice-and-dice form. But for those in search of something different, ''Wendigo'' is a genuinely bone-chilling tale\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=A With-It Way to Jump Up and Say 'Boo!'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 2002|page=32}}</ref> Felix Vasquez, Jr. from Cinema Crazed.com gave the film a positive review, praising the film's ending and suspense.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vasquez Jr.|first=Velix|title=Wendigo (2001) {{!}} Cinema Crazed - Celebrating Film Culture & Pop Culture|url=http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2002/07/07/wendigo-2001/|website=Cinema Crazed.com|date=July 7, 2002|accessdate=August 25, 2021}}</ref> [[AllMovie]] called the film \"effectively creepy\" and \"surprisingly unsettling\", \"despite its inherent cheesiness\".<ref name=AllMovie/>\n\nScott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' suggested that \"[the film], which should rivet audiences attracted to the more philosophical elements of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' could build strong word-of-mouth if not misrepresented as a conventional monster movie\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Wendigo|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/wendigo-1200466933/|last=Foundas|first=Scott|date=February 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Until Dawn]]'' \n*''[[Ghostkeeper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.thewendigo.com/}}\n*{{IMDb title|0275067}}\n\n[[Category:2001 horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s monster movies]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:American psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about cryptids]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Glass Eye Pix films]]\n[[Category:Magnolia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:Wendigos in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Films based on Native American mythology]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
