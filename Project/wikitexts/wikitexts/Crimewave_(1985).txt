Smith]], [[Brion James]], [[Sheree J. Wilson]], [[Edward R. Pressman]], [[Bruce Campbell]], and [[Reed Birney]], with Campbell also serving as a producer. Following the commercial success of ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the [[Coen brothers]] served as one of the editors on ''The Evil Dead'', and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, [[Embassy Pictures]], refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot of the film due to continued interference by the studio.\n\nAn unusual [[slapstick]] mix of [[film noir]], [[black comedy]] and [[B-movie]] conventions, ''Crimewave'' portrays bizarre situations involving a [[death row]] inmate. The film was a box-office flop, and has since fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed it upon release, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative.\n\nSeveral story and style elements found in ''Crimewave'' influenced later productions by Raimi, and its overall failure directly led to the inception of ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987). Over time, the film has achieved the status of a minor [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nVictor Ajax has been sentenced to death, sitting in an electric chair. In a flashback, we learn that Victor once was a promising young technician in the employ of Trend-Odegard Security. Mr. Trend, co-owner of the company, has learned of a plan by his partner to sell the company to Renaldo \"The Heel\" and responds by hiring two exterminators who promise to \"kill all sizes\" in order to eliminate Odegard and his plan. When Victor, who has been installing security cameras in Trend's apartment building, seems about to go back to the store, Trend distracts him with a lecture about \"the grand design\" and sends Victor on a quest to find his dream girl.\n\nThe dream girl is found in the form of Nancy, who responds minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes a target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the electric chair, and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Helene Trend\n* [[Paul L.

Hollywood executives took an interest in everything.\"<ref name=\"soap3\"/>  Campbell was surprised that he had to audition for the lead role, as he did not have to test for ''The Evil Dead''.<ref name=\"soap3\"/>  Campbell and his photographer friend Mike Ditz used a [[16 mm film]] camera and shot a scene to show to the producers. Upon viewing it, the producers asserted that \"Campbell will not star in this film\".<ref name=\"soap3\"/>  In retaliation, Raimi lengthened a supporting role and gave it to Campbell: the character of Renaldo \"The Heel\". This allowed for Campbell to be present through the production, which Campbell later noted was a good thing, as due to the constant studio interference \"Sam needed all the help he could get\".<ref name=\"soap3\"/>\n\nRaimi budgeted the film at $2.5 million, an amount the studio greenlit. But the calculations had not taken union fees and regulations into account, making the proposed budgeting and scheduling unrealistic.<ref name=\"soap3\"/> In addition, the crew were talked into spending three times the allotted money for one shooting location. The shoot quickly went both over budget and over schedule.<ref name=\"soap4\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 163</ref> At that point, the studio stepped in, with executives demanding cuts in the script, budget restrictions, layoffs, and their own supervision of the project.<ref name=\"soap5\"/> The studio also insisted on reviewing every batch of dailies, criticizing the decision to use cast and crew members (including Campbell) as extras in several scenes (a Raimi trademark known as \"[[Fake Shemp|Shemping]]\").<ref name=\"soap5\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp. 164\u2013165</ref><ref>[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 115</ref>\n\n[[File:Ambassadorbridgefrombase.jpg|alt=Image of a bridge and a river view.|Because the [[Detroit River]] was frozen, the cast had to use dynamite to achieve a shot of the water.|thumb|left]]\nEven without Embassy's interference, however, the production was plagued with difficulties.<ref name=\"disaster\"/> According to Campbell, lead actress Lasser\u2014under the influence of cocaine\u2014fired her make-up artist.<ref name=\"soap4\"/> She insisted that she apply all her own make-up, despite objections from the cast. She would often show up on set with poorly applied \"clown make-up\" and messed up hair, oblivious to how she appeared.<ref name=\"soap4\"/> There were occasions when she outright refused to leave her trailer, to the annoyance of the cast and crew.<ref name=\"soap4\"/> Production was often affected by \"weird\" events; actor [[Brion James]] trashed his hotel room in an attempt to \"exorcise a ghost from his light fixtures\".<ref name=\"soap4\"/>\n\nAt one point, shooting was to take place at a [[Ambassador Bridge|bridge]] overlooking the [[Detroit River]], which was frozen at the time.<ref name=\"soap6\"/> The script, however, called for clear and running water, meaning that the crew had to brave dangerously low temperatures and conditions to clear the ice; finally they blew up the ice with dynamite.<ref name=\"soap6\"/> At another time, the crew spent a week filming on a Detroit street after dark, directly under a nursing home, with huge wind machines blowing for long hours. One evening a glass bottle with a note in it crashed to the ground from an upper floor. The note inside read, \"The noise is keeping me awake all night long and I am getting sick.

It was such a horrible, horrible, horrible, depressing scene.\"<ref name=\"soap6\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&nbsp;166\u2013167</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter all the editing imposed by the studio, ''Crimewave'' still became a box-office flop. Campbell reasoned that \"cross-genre\" films \"send marketing people scurrying under a desk\".<ref name=\"flop\"/> According to him, the film was hard to market because it featured elements of horror films, comedies, and dramas.<ref name=\"flop\"/> To make matters even more confusing, in France and Italy, the film's title was changed to ''Death on the Grill'' and ''The Two Craziest Killers in the World'' respectively.<ref name=\"flop\"/> In the United States, the film was only released in Santa Cruz, California; [[Kansas]]; and [[Alaska]], to make the film eligible for [[HBO]] broadcasting. Upon release, the film \"went down in box-office flames\", with Campbell commenting \"it wasn't released. It escaped!\"<ref name=\"flop\"/> The \"only good\" screening came the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], where the movie was promoted as a novelty film.<ref name=\"flop\">[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 169</ref>\n\n[[File:COEN Brothers (cannesPH).jpg|alt=Two men in button-up shirts smiling.|The screenplay written by the [[Coen brothers]] received a mixed reception by critics.|thumb|right]]\nAlong with Raimi and Campbell, film critics were largely dismissive of the film.
