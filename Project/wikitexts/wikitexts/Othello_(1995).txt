It was directed by [[Oliver Parker]] and stars [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Othello (character)|Othello]], [[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as [[Desdemona]], and [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Iago]]. This is the first cinematic reproduction of the play released by a major studio that casts an [[African American]] actor to play the role of Othello, although low-budget independent films of the play starring [[Ted Lange]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098038/|title=Othello|date=1 May 1989|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> and [[Yaphet Kotto]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081287/|title=Othello|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> predated it.\n\n==Plot==\nThis film is an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]''. Othello, a [[Moors|Moor]] who has secretly married his native Venetian lover [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]], is assigned to fight against a Turkish invasion attempt on the island of [[Cyprus]]. During the battle, he was accompanied by his faithful lieutenant, Cassio. When Othello finally arrives at Cyprus, however, the Turkish invasion fleet has been wrecked by a storm, and, reunited with Desdemona, who had volunteered herself to go with him, leads his men and the people of Cyprus in a celebration.\n\n[[Iago]], Othello's trusted companion and ensign, envies Othello's prosperous life and Cassio's lieutenancy and, convinced that both of them had slept with his own wife, Emilia, plans to ruin both by manipulating Othello into believing that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio and is pregnant with Cassio's child. He arouses Othello's suspicion and jealousy gradually and then plants Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's clothing for Othello to find. When he does, he is convinced of Desdemona's [[infidelity]] and, in a rage, decides to kill both her and Cassio.\n\nOthello [[Asphyxia|smothers]] Desdemona, who dies just as Emilia enters the bedroom. Emilia then tells Othello the truth behind Iago's lies and he realizes what he has done. The authorities and Othello turn on Iago, and, after a running fight, capture and beat him. In despair, Othello stabs and wounds Iago. Othello then kills himself, and Iago is taken away to be [[tortured]] and [[executed]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Othello (character)|Othello]]\n*[[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]\n*[[Kenneth Branagh]] as  [[Iago]]\n*[[Nathaniel Parker]] as [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]]\n*[[Michael Maloney]] as [[Roderigo (Othello)|Roderigo]]\n* Anna Patrick as [[Emilia (Othello)|Emilia]]\n*[[Nicholas Farrell]] as Montano\n*[[Indra Ov\u00e9]] as [[Bianca (Othello)|Bianca]]\n*[[Michael Sheen]] as Lodovico\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received largely positive reviews, especially for Branagh's [[Iago]].

Mr. Fishburne's performance has a dangerous edge that ultimately works to its advantage, and he smolders movingly through the most anguished parts of the role. ... Anna Patrick is particularly transfixing in the role of Emilia, Iago's wife and Desdemona's servant, who scathingly articulates some of the play's feminist undercurrents.\"<ref name=Maslin>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/14/movies/film-review-fishburne-and-branagh-meet-their-fate-in-venice.html|title=FILM REVIEW;Fishburne and Branagh Meet Their Fate in Venice|first=Janet|last=Maslin|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 December 1995}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 2022, the film holds a rating of 68% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews with the consensus: \"Perhaps less than the sum of its parts, ''Othello'' is still highly entertaining and features excellent performances from Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1069707-othello/|title=Othello|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0114057|title=Othello}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1069707-othello}}\n*{{Mojo title|othello95}}\n\n{{Oliver Parker}}\n{{Othello}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Othello]]\n[[Category:1995 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 16th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venice]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Oliver Parker]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by David Barron]]\n[[Category:1995 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
