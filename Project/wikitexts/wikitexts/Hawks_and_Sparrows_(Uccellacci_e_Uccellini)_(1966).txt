It was entered into the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]] where a \"Special Mention\" was made of [[Tot\u00f2]], for his acting performance.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2838/year/1966.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Hawks and the Sparrows |accessdate=2009-03-08|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film can be described as partially [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]], and deals with [[Marxist]] concerns about poverty and class-conflict. It features the popular Italian comic-actor [[Tot\u00f2]] accompanied on a journey by his son (played by [[Ninetto Davoli]]). This is the last film to star Tot\u00f2 before his untimely death of a heart attack in 1967.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Uccellacci e uccellini.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tot\u00f2]] and [[Alfredo Bini]] on the set of ''The Hawks and the Sparrows'']]\nTot\u00f2 and his son Ninetto roam the neighbourhood and the countryside of Rome. During the walk they observe a body being removed from a house following a murder. They next encounter a talking crow, who is described in the [[intertitle]]s thus: \"''For the benefit of those who were not paying attention or are in doubt, we remind you that the Crow is \u2013 as you say \u2013 a left-wing intellectual of the kind found living before [[Palmiro Togliatti]]'s death\").\n\nThe Crow subsequently recounts the tale of \"Fra Ciccillo\" and \"Fra Ninetto\" (still played by Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto), two [[Franciscan]] friars, who are bid by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] to preach the [[Gospel]] to the hawks (representing the powerful) and the sparrows (representing the weak). After many failures they discover the language of birds and succeed in preaching the commandment of love unto the species separately, but are not able to get them to love each other. The hawks continue to kill and eat the sparrows, as it is in their nature. Saint Francis explains the [[class conflict|relationship]] between the two groups to them from a [[Marxist]] perspective and invites them to continue [[proselytizing]].\n\nAfter the tale, the journey of Tot\u00f2 and Ninetto carries on, the Crow still accompanying them. They encounter other individuals: land-owners who order them off their land when they are caught defecating; a family living in absolute poverty with no food and whom Tot\u00f2 threatens to drive out of the house if the rent is not paid; a group of travelling actors (representing figures marginalised from society such as women, gays, the elderly, racial minorities, and the disabled) and who persuade the pair to push the group's [[Cadillac]] car for them; and a rich man who is waiting for Tot\u00f2 to give him the money he owes him (in contrast to the earlier episode where Toto had demanded rent). This is followed by news footage of the funeral of Palmiro Togliatti, the long-time leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Finally, after having met a prostitute, the two end up killing and eating the Crow, whom they found to be unconscionably boring.\n\nPasolini declared that ''Uccellacci e uccellini'' was his favourite film, as it was the only one that did not disappoint his expectations.\n\n[[Ennio Morricone]]'s opening theme music features [[Domenico Modugno]] singing the movie's credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tot\u00f2]] \u2013 Innocenti Tot\u00f2 / Brother Ciccillo\n* [[Ninetto Davoli]] \u2013 Innocenti Ninetto / Brother Ninetto (as Davoli Ninetto)\n* [[Femi Benussi]] \u2013 Luna, the prostitute\n* [[Francesco Leonetti]] \u2013 The Crow (voice)\n* [[Gabriele Baldini]] \u2013 The engineer\n* [[Riccardo Redi]] \u2013 The dentist [[Dante Alighieri|dantist]]\n* [[Lena Lin Solaro]] \u2013 Urganda, the unknown\n* [[Rossana di Rocco]] \u2013 Friend of Ninetto\n* [[Umberto Bevilacqua]] \u2013 Incensurato\n* [[Renato Capogna]] \u2013 The medieval rude fellow\n* [[Vittorio Vittori]] \u2013 Ciro Lococo\n* [[Renato Montalbano]]\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Assisi]], [[Tuscania]], [[Viterbo]], [[Rome]] and at [[Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport]]. Interior sets from ''Incir De Paolis Studios'' were also used.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061132/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\nPasolini chose to cast Tot\u00f2 as the protagonist as he felt his comedic style represented the two aspects of humanity: extravagance and humanity. Pasolini chose to use both non-professional actors from off the streets and Italian cinematic icons like Tot\u00f2 because he felt the brutality of the amateur and the lightness of the professional worked together.\n\nTot\u00f2 was used to choosing his own jokes and ad-libbing his own lines but for this film he learned to respect Pasolini's script and direction.<ref>Intervista a Pasolini e Tot\u00f2 sul set del film \"Uccellacci e uccellini\", 1966</ref>\n\n[[Carlo Croccolo]] offered to dub Tot\u00f2 for Pasolini as he worked on the dubbing for many of Tot\u00f2's other films but Pasolini refused this.\n\nScenes had to frequently be reshot as the crow kept trying to claw at Tot\u00f2's eyes. Thus a system was devised where the crow's cage was placed behind the camera and the crow would chase after it.<ref>Il cinema di Tot\u00f2: Uccellacci e Uccellini, antoniodecurtis.com.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had great critical success but the commercial success was very weak. This is the lowest grossing film to star Tot\u00f2.\n\nDue to the film's success among Italian critics it has made it on to the list of \"[[100 film italiani da salvare|100 Italian films to be saved]]\" and is on the 1,000 greatest films of all time list of \"They Shoot Pictures Don't They\".<ref>https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/100+italian+films+to+be+saved+100+film+italiani+da+salvare/vancleeffr/</ref><ref>https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/tspdts+1000+greatest+films/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.antoniodecurtis.org/uccella_en.htm Card english version + videoclip \"Uccellacci e uccellini]\n*{{IMDb title|0061132|Uccellacci e uccellini}}\n*{{Amg movie|21736|Uccellacci e uccellini}}\n\n{{Pier Paolo Pasolini}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hawks And The Sparrows, The}}\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini]]\n[[Category:1966 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Italian political satire films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
