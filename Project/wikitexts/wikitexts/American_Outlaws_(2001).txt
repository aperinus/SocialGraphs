The guerillas are ambushed, but thanks to the sharp-shooting of [[Frank James]] and the distractions of his brother [[Jesse James|Jesse]] they survive. The James, along with their buddies, the Younger brothers, congratulate themselves but learn that the Confederacy has pulled out of the war and it is over. The group decides to return to [[Missouri]] to their families and farms.\n\nWhen they arrive, their town is occupied by the Union Army. Jesse's childhood friend Zee has grown into an attractive young woman, and there is a man hanging in the town square. Farmers are being pressured to sell their farms to the railroad company, who are pushing across the United States. If they don't sell their land to Thaddeus Rains, and his secret-service organizer, [[Allan Pinkerton]], the farmers are burned out of their homes, or killed.\n\nFrank finds the railroad doesn't even need their land. The James and Younger brothers don't want to sell, and Cole Younger loses his temper when several railroad men approach him about selling, and kills two of them. The army decides to hang him, but his brothers Bob and Jim, along with Jesse, Frank, and Zee, decide to rescue him. During the rescue, Jesse is shot in the shoulder, and hides out at Zee's.\n\nA few weeks later, when Jesse has recovered, the railroad sets fire to the James' home, killing Jesse's mother. The James and Younger brothers ride out for revenge against the railroad men but instead focus on the bank's payroll, reasoning that if they steal the money and attack supply trains, the army will notice. Dubbing themselves the [[James\u2013Younger Gang]], they set out robbing banks, with Pinkerton and Rains struggling to stop them. The James gang turns themselves into folk heroes in the process.\n\nThe gang struggles over leadership, with Cole feeling that Jesse is getting an overblown ego from the publicity of the gang's activities. Jesse backs down, after an argument, and lets Cole plan and execute a robbery; Cole's chosen target proves to be a trap set by Pinkerton and Rains. Jim is shot and killed, and Jesse and his brother leave the gang, with Jesse later marrying Zee.\n\nThe gang does not do well without the James'. People do not respect the Younger brothers as much as they did the James-Younger Gang. When Jesse and Zee attempt to start a new life, Pinkerton finds and arrests Jesse. During the train ride to the jail, Jesse is chained in a rear car, but tricks a deputy into showing his gun, which he takes from him and uses to escape to the top of the train car.\n\nZee and the remainder of the Gang shoot a cannon at the train, stopping it and rescuing Jesse. Confronted with Rains and Pinkerton, Jesse shoots neither of them but rather Rains' prized watch. Pinkerton tells Jesse that he should go to [[Tennessee]], as 'the railroad has no interest in Tennessee'.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as [[Jesse James]]\n* [[Scott Caan]] as [[Cole Younger]]\n* [[Ali Larter]] as [[Zee Mimms]]\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as [[Frank James]]\n* [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] as [[Jim Younger]]\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Thaddeus Rains\n* [[Will McCormack]] as [[Bob Younger]]\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Ma James\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[Allan Pinkerton]]\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Doc Mimms\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Rollin Parker\n* [[Nathaniel Arcand]] as Comanche Tom \n* [[Ty O'Neal]] as [[Clell Miller]] \n* Joe Stevens as Loni Packwood \n* [[Muse Watson]] as Burly Detective\n}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 4, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Wolf|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/industry_article.cfm?article_id=1843|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011101134024/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/industry_article.cfm?article_id=1843|title=Warner Offers Retailers Free DVD Players|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=November 1, 2001|date=September 27, 2001|access-date=September 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\n''American Outlaws'' opened to dismal box office and mostly negative reviews.
