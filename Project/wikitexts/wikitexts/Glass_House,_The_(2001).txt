The film stars [[Leelee Sobieski]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Kathy Baker]], [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] and [[Chris Noth]].\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $23 million on a $30 million production budget. The main reason cited for the financial failure of the film was the fact that the film was released 3 days after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==Plot==\nSixteen-year-old Ruby Baker and eleven-year-old brother Rhett lose their parents, David and Grace, in a car accident. Their  [[Will (law)|will]] is not recent but, per its terms, the children are placed under the [[Legal guardian|guardianship]] of family neighbors from years ago, the childless couple Dr. Erin Glass and Terry Glass, who live in a large glass house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]].\n\nFrom early on, all is not well. The children have to share a room; they are no longer educated privately, and Rhett is allowed to play video [[Video game console|games]] at all hours. Ruby is uncomfortable with Terry's sexual hints when they are alone, and later finds unlabeled pharmaceuticals and sees Erin injecting herself, although she claims it is for [[diabetes]]. Ruby tries to get the children's estate and [[trust fund]] lawyer Alvin Begleiter to accept her concerns, but visiting social worker Nancy Ryan is taken in by the couple's assurances.\n\nIn the trash, Ruby discovers a postcard from their maternal Uncle Jack and a letter from a private school indicating the Glasses unregistered the children, pocketing the $30,000+ tuition. Ruby also discovers Terry is in debt to [[loan shark]]s, gradually realizing the Glasses are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund.\n\nSuspicious of her parents' deaths, Ruby discovers evidence of the Glasses' involvement from spotting a [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] similar to David's at Terry's shop, and reading an article stating Ruby's parents had been driving a [[BMW]] (later revealed to be registered to Terry's business). Moreover, Ruby is expelled from school because her essay, which Terry wrote for her as a favor, was plagiarized; Terry plans to send Ruby to a distant boarding school. After the loan sharks push him to pay off his debt, Terry tries to get money from the trustee, claiming it is to be used for the children's benefit. His request is denied and he is shown a copy of the un-registration letter from the school, previously faxed to the authority by Ruby, which alerts the trustee to doubt Terry's real purpose for the money.\n\nThat same night, Ruby steals Terry's car keys, wakes Rhett and drives off in his Jaguar, attempting to escape, but because of a mudslide, the police stop her and demand to see her license. Terry and Erin appear, talking the police into letting the children go. Back home, Ruby attempts to run away again but they knock her down and drug her. Terry then tells Erin they must get rid of her. Erin is overcome by guilt; she is permanently stripped of her medical license, due to her drug abuse being discovered by her employer, Dr. Weiss. Erin commits suicide by overdose and the next morning, both Ruby and Terry are devastated to find her dead. Terry locks the kids in the basement and sabotages his Jaguar, expecting them to reattempt escape and to consequently perish. The loan sharks (alerted by Ruby posing as Erin) appear at the house, kill Begleiter (who has come to confront Terry, revealing his complicity), repossess Terry's Jaguar and Ferrari, and insist on taking a ride. Overhearing Terry begging them to take the Volvo instead of the Jaguar, Ruby stabs the Volvo's tires, forcing them to drive away in the Jaguar with Terry in it. The car goes over a ledge and crashes, seemingly killing a loan shark and Terry.\n\nMeanwhile, the children are picked up by a friendly cop. They pass the scene of the accident with the Ferrari and the kids see a body being covered up. Continuing on, he stops at the site of the other crash. Telling the children to stay in the car while he investigates, he finds the car and radios that there is one fatality. Terry knocks him out then, severely injured, he climbs to the road and staggers towards Ruby and Rhett, hiding a gun. Ruby gets into the driver's seat and, telling Rhett to put on his seatbelt, speeds into Terry, killing him.\n\nThe kids are last seen placing flowers at their parents' grave with their Uncle Jack, who hugs them and says that things will get easier. Ruby says that they already have, and the three leave together to go home to [[Chicago]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Ruby Baker\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Dr. Erin Glass\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Terrence \"Terry\" Glass\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Alvin Begleiter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Nancy Ryan\n* [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] as Rhett Baker\n* [[Chris Noth]] as Uncle Jack Avery\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Grace Avery-Baker \n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as David Baker\n* [[Vyto Ruginis]] as Don\n* [[Gavin O'Connor (director)|Gavin O'Connor]] as \"Whitey\"\n* [[Carly Pope]] as Tasha\n* [[China Shavers|China Jesusita Shavers]] as E.B.\n* [[Agnes Bruckner]] as Zoe\n* [[Michael Paul Chan]] as Mr. Kim\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Hannah\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Vice Principal\n* [[John Billingsley]] as Driving Instructor\n* Julia Vera as Vicki\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on January 2, 2002. A [[Blu-ray]] version of the film has yet to be released in the US. The film finally debuted on the Blu-ray format for the first time on October 22, 2021 in Germany in a Blu-ray / DVD combo pack by Just Bridge Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Glass-House-Blu-ray/297332/|title = The Glass House Blu-ray (DigiBook) (Germany)}}</ref> The original cut of the film was reported to be 180 minutes long, with 74 minutes of footage missing from the theatrical cut. [[Kip Pardue]] played [[Leelee Sobieski]]'s love interest in the original cut, though all of his scenes ended up on the [[cutting room floor]]. Of all the deleted footage, only two scenes managed to survive. They are included on the DVD as deleted scenes (listed below):\n\n* After Ruby faints when she finds the cops at her house, she wakes up the next morning believing her parents' accident was only a nightmare. When she heads downstairs, the neighbors are there to tell her it wasn't. Ruby sits at the table and cries as the camera slowly pans away from her, as Rhett is told offscreen and runs away in devastation.\n* Ruby and Rhett are seen at their parents' funeral burying their ashes at the cemetery.\n\nThere's also one scene in the trailer showing Ruby furiously ripping posters off her wall, which doesn't appear in the finished film or on home video.\n\nBecause of the film's critical and financial failure, the studio had little interest in keeping unused footage and the missing 74 minutes of footage have since been considered [[Lost film|lost]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number two in its opening weekend at the US [[box office]], behind ''[[Hardball (film)|Hardball]]'', in which [[Diane Lane]] also stars. ''The Glass House'' grossed $18,150,259 domestically and $5,469,350 overseas, grossing a total of $23,619,609. The film's production budget was $30 million, resulting in a [[box-office bomb]].<ref name=Mojo/>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a review aggregator, reports that the film received positive reviews by 21% of the 86 surveyed critics. The average rating was 4.23/10, and the consensus is: \"Due to obvious plot twists and foreshadowing, The Glass House fails to thrill.
