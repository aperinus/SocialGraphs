Her dream is to become a [[Hip hop dance|hip hop]] [[choreographer]], though her mother presses her to teach ballet uptown.\n\nHoney and her rival Katrina are recorded having a dance off. Honey and her friend Gina find brothers Benny and Raymond street dancing and invite them to Honey's classes.\n\nThe  dance off video reaches video director Michael Ellis, who gives Honey a job as a backup dancer and asks Honey to replace his [[choreographer]]. Soon, her career brings money, fame and freedom, but takes her away from the center and the neighborhood kids.\n\nRaymond tells Honey Benny got into a fight in which their mother\u2019s boyfriend split Benny's lip. Honey offers Benny a job as her assistant if he keeps out of trouble. She convinces Michael to use the kids she teaches in [[Ginuwine]]'s new video. Honey begins dating Raymond's barber Chaz, who inspires her to focus on her happiness and not on the fame. She puts down a deposit on an old store she can turn into a dance studio.\n\nWhen Michael says they cannot miss an important meeting, Honey cancels plans to take Gina to Atlantic City for her birthday. However, it is actually a networking party, where Michael drunkenly hits on her. She slaps him and leaves. Gina is furious to see a newspaper photo of Honey being kissed at the party she claimed was work. At the Ginuwine shoot, Michael reneges on having the kids in the video and fires her, showing up on set with Katrina.\n\nThe kids are heartbroken. Benny returns to drug dealing and lands in [[Youth detention center|juvy]] after being busted. When Honey visits him he is hostile, telling her to leave him alone. She obliges but first asks how often his gangster friends visit him. Benny realizes that none of his \"friends\" have visited him and sees that he is a poor example to Raymond, and that he has disappointed himself. He realizes he can accomplish his hopes and dreams.\n\nHoney is relieved when Gina forgives her. Since the ruined [[Ginuwine]] video, income has dried up due to Michael blackballing Honey in the industry. The remainder of the [[down payment]] must be paid or the store will go back on the market. Honey decides to hold a dance benefit at an abandoned church and newly-released Benny brings his dance friends to help.\n\nMichael pushes Katrina as choreographer for a [[Missy Elliott]] video, but she says Katrina's sexy dance moves are not for her and she only wants Honey. Michael begs Honey to come back again, offering to buy her the studio. Realizing that the artists want her back, she refuses, declaring she will pay for the studio herself. She berates Michael for his selfish arrogance, pointing out that not only did he blackball her out of pettiness, he also betrayed the kids.\n\nGina's bank manager asks arts donors to attend the benefit, which is a full house and everyone is enthusiastic about the performances. Honey's mother finally sees that the dance form her daughter loves can give her everything that ballet could. The bank manager assures Honey the building is fully funded.\n\nMissy Elliott arrives as the benefit finishes, rushing in to meet Honey. She introduces Honey to R&B group [[Blaque]] at her new dance studio, ''The Bronx Dance Center'', to prepare their new video.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Honey Daniels, a hip-hop choreographer\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Chaz, a barber, Honey's boyfriend\n* [[Romeo Miller]] (credited as Lil' Romeo) as Benny\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Gina, Honey's best friend\n* [[David Moscow]] as Michael Ellis, a music producer\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Mrs. Connie Daniels, Honey's mom\n* Zachary Isaiah Williams as Raymond, Benny's brother\n* [[Laurie Ann Gibson]] as Katrina, Honey's rival\n\nA number of popular [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musicians, groups and producers play themselves in prominent cameos, including [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Sheek Louch]], [[Shawn Desman]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[3rd Storee]], [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]], and [[Blaque]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film is inspired by the life of choreographer [[Laurieann Gibson]], who was the film's choreographer and appeared on screen as Katrina, the main character's rival.<ref name=MTVNews040811>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661609/laurieann-gibson-the-dance-scene.jhtml |title=Laurieann Gibson Says 'The Dance Scene' Is Not Just A Dance Show |last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=2011-04-08 |access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2003/12/05/simple_and_sweet_honey_lacks_substance/ |title=Simple and sweet 'Honey' lacks substance |last=Morris |first=Wesley |work=[[Boston.com]] |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2003-12-05 |access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\t \nSinger/actress [[Aaliyah]] was reportedly originally cast as Honey, though the role was later recast to [[Jessica Alba]] due to Aaliyah's death in August 2001.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=SIGHT: Honey (2003) |magazine=torque<!--NOT to be linked to the messed up article for occasional UK-based blog [[Torque (magazine)]]--> |publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings|SPH Magazines]] |page=103 |issn=0218-7868 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103 |date=July 2008 |access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref> However, in 2020, director [[Bille Woodruff]] debunked the rumor, stating: \"That\u2019s incorrect.
