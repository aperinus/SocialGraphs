The film was directed by [[Paul Johansson]] and stars [[Taylor Schilling]] as [[Dagny Taggart]] and [[Grant Bowler]] as [[Hank Rearden]].\n\nThe film begins the story of ''Atlas Shrugged'', set in a dystopian United States where [[John Galt]] leads innovators, from industrialists to artists, in a [[capital strike]], \"stopping the motor of the world\" to reassert the importance of the free use of one's mind and of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]].<ref name=sfgate>{{cite web|work=SFGate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Atlas-Shrugged-Part-1-review-A-dystopian-tale-2374986.php|title='Atlas Shrugged Part 1' review: A dystopian tale|date=14 April 2011|first=Mick|last=LaSalle}}</ref>\n\nDespite near universally negative critical response and [[box office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing just under a fourth of its budget, a [[sequel]], ''[[Atlas Shrugged: Part II]]'', was released on October 12, 2012, albeit with an entirely different cast.

Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at $37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]] shirks responsibility. His sister [[Dagny Taggart]], Vice-President in Charge of Operations, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny meets with its inventor, [[Hank Rearden]], and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests.\n\nPolitician [[Wesley Mouch]]\u2014nominally Rearden's [[lobbyist]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\u2014is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of [[Colorado]]. Dagny is confronted by [[Ellis Wyatt]], a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover [[Francisco d'Anconia]], who presents a fa\u00e7ade of a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of [[Copper extraction|copper mines]] he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions.\n\nRearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it. Rearden's anniversary gift to his wife Lillian is a bracelet made from the first batch of Rearden Metal, but she considers it a garish symbol of Hank's egotism. At a dinner party, Dagny dares Lillian to exchange it for Dagny's diamond necklace, which she does.\n\nAs Dagny and Rearden rebuild the Rio Norte line, talented people quit their jobs and refuse all inducements to stay. Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Stadler of the State Science Institute puts out a report implying that Rearden Metal is dangerous. Taggart Transcontinental stock plummets because of its use of Rearden Metal, and Dagny leaves Taggart Transcontinental temporarily and forms her own company to finish the Rio Norte line. She renames it the John Galt Line, in defiance of the phrase \"Who is John Galt?\"\u2014which has come to stand for any question to which it is pointless to seek an answer.\n\nA new law forces Rearden to sell most of his businesses, but he retains Rearden Steel for the sake of his metal and to finish the John Galt Line. Despite strong government and union opposition to Rearden Metal, Dagny and Rearden complete the line ahead of schedule and successfully test it on a record-setting run to Wyatt's oil fields in Colorado. At the home of Wyatt, now a close friend, Dagny and Rearden celebrate the success of the line. As Dagny and Rearden continue their celebration into the night by fulfilling their growing sexual attraction, the shadowy figure responsible for the disappearances of prominent people visits Wyatt with an offer for a better society based on personal achievement.\n\nThe next morning, Dagny and Rearden begin investigating an abandoned prototype of an advanced motor that could revolutionize the world. They realize the genius of the motor's creator and try to track him down. Dagny finds Dr. Hugh Akston, working as a cook at a [[diner]], but he is not willing to reveal the identity of the inventor; Akston knows whom Dagny is seeking and says she will never find him, though he may find her.\n\nAnother new law limits rail freight and levies a special tax on Colorado. It is the final straw for Ellis Wyatt. When Dagny hears that Wyatt's [[oil field]]s are on fire, she rushes to the scene of the fire where she finds a handwritten sign nailed to the wall that reads \"I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.\"\n\nWyatt declares in an [[answering machine]] message that he is \"on strike\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Taylor Schilling at Paley Fest Orange Is The New Black.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=|[[Taylor Schilling]] starred as Dagny Taggart.]]\n{{see also|List of Atlas Shrugged characters}}\n* [[Taylor Schilling]] as Dagny Taggart\n* [[Grant Bowler]] as Henry \"Hank\" Rearden\n* [[Matthew Marsden]] as James Taggart\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Ellis Wyatt\n* [[Edi Gathegi]] as Edwin \"Eddie\" Willers\n* [[Jsu Garcia]] as Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Wesley Mouch\n* Jack Milo as Richard McNamara\n* [[Ethan Cohn]] as Owen Kellogg\n* [[Rebecca Wisocky]] as Lillian Rearden\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as Mother Rearden\n* [[Neill Barry]] as Philip Rearden\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Paul Larkin\n* [[Sylva Kelegian]] as Ivy Starnes\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Orren Boyle\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Hugh Akston\n* [[Geoff Pierson]] as Midas Mulligan\n* [[Armin Shimerman]] as Dr. Potter\n* [[Paul Johansson]] as John Galt (only in [[silhouette]])<ref name=\"libertasfilmmagazine.com\">{{cite web |last=Murty |first=Govindini |url=http://www.libertasfilmmagazine.com/exclusive-lfm-visits-the-set-of-atlas-shrugged-director-paul-johanssons-first-interview-about-the-film-part-i/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: LFM Visits the Set of ''Atlas Shrugged'' + Director Paul Johansson's First Interview About the Film |publisher=Libertas Film Magazine |date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=August 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801030734/http://www.libertasfilmmagazine.com/exclusive-lfm-visits-the-set-of-atlas-shrugged-director-paul-johanssons-first-interview-about-the-film-part-i/ |archive-date=August 1, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"trailer\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Aglialoro (left) with Harmon Kaslow.JPG|thumb|right|alt=|[[John Aglialoro]] (left) and [[Harmon Kaslow]] (right) produced the film.]]\nIn 1972, [[Albert S.
