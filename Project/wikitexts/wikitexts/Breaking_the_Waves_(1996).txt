Set in the [[Scottish Highlands]] in the early 1970s, it is about an unusual young woman and of the love she has for her husband, who asks her to have sex with other men when he becomes immobilised from a [[work accident]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 16, 2019 |title='It's not about the sex and violence' \u2013 Breaking the Waves |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/17832251.its-not-sex-violence---breaking-waves-opera/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817154401/https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/17832251.its-not-sex-violence---breaking-waves-opera/ |archive-date=17 August 2021 |website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]}}</ref> The film is an [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] between United Kingdom and Denmark, the latter's involvement led by von Trier under his Danish company [[Zentropa]]. It is the first film in Trier's Golden Heart Trilogy, which also includes ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998) and ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bodil Marie Stavning Thomsen |date=April 1, 2019 |title=Lars von Trier (b. 1956) |url=https://nordics.info/show/artikel/lars-von-trier-b-1956/ |access-date=2021-08-17 |website=nordics.info |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs von Trier's first film made after his founding of the [[Dogme 95]] movement, it is heavily influenced by the movement's style and ethos, although the film breaks several of the rules laid out by the movement's manifesto. ''Breaking the Waves'' has been described as \"perhaps von Trier's most widely acclaimed film\", and has won numerous awards, including the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Winter |first=Jessica |date=22 October 2009 |title=Is Lars von Trier a Misogynist? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/10/is_lars_von_trier_a_misogynist.html |magazine=Slate |access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> The film was critically well-received, with Watson's performance drawing acclaim as well as a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nBess McNeill is a young  and pretty Scottish woman, who has, in the past, had treatment for unspecified [[mental health]] illness after the death of her brother. She marries [[Oil platform|oil rig worker]] Jan Nyman, a Danish [[church (congregation)|non-churchgoer]], despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart, but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with Him in her own voice, believing that He is responding directly through her.\n\nBess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred, that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking for him to neglect his job and come back to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to hospital.\n\nJan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalise his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholly. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement as she believes it will save her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan's doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalised in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. The entire village is scandalised by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated. In the face of being cast out from her church, she proclaims, \"You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with a word. You can only love a human being.\"\n\nDodo and Jan's doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her [[Involuntary commitment|committed]], and as far away from her husband as possible, whom they believe to be in [[Terminal illness|terminal decline]]. It is then that Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: she unflinchingly goes out to a derelict ship full of barbarous sailors, who violently gang rape and attack her, causing her death. Her church deems her soul to be lost and hell-bound. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess's body inside her sealed coffin. Jan is later shown, substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought it possible, burying Bess in the ocean, deep in grief. The film ends in [[magical realism]] as Bess's body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Emily Watson]] as Bess McNeill\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Jan Nyman\n* [[Katrin Cartlidge]] as Dodo McNeill\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Terry\n* [[Adrian Rawlins]] as Dr. Richardson\n* Jonathan Hackett as Priest\n* [[Sandra Voe]] as Mrs. McNeill\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Sadistic Sailor\n* [[Mikkel Gaup]] as Pits\n* [[Roef Ragas]] as Pim\n* [[Phil McCall]] as Grandfather\n* [[Robert Robertson (actor)|Robert Robertson]] as Chairman\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Breaking the Waves'' was von Trier's first film after founding the [[Dogma 95]] movement with fellow Danish director [[Thomas Vinterberg]]. However the film breaks many of the movement's \"rules\", including built sets, post-dubbed music and computer graphics.<ref>''Breaking the Waves'' DVD liner notes. The Criterion Collection. 2014.

He wanted to make a naturalistic film that was also a religious film without any miracles. Von Trier claimed that it took him five years to write the film and get financial backing, and he began to lose enthusiasm for it right after filming began. It had a budget of 42 million [[Danish krone|kroner]].<ref name=\"auto\">Criterion notes. p. 14.</ref>\n\n[[Helena Bonham Carter]] was von Trier's first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role.<ref>{{cite web |date=2004-01-31 |title=Lars von Trier: Pornographer? |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/43/trier.php |access-date=12 September 2015 |work=Bright Lights Film Journal}}</ref> Several other big-name actresses were considered, but none of them were comfortable with the subject matter. Von Trier was eventually won over by [[Emily Watson]]'s audition, even though she was a complete unknown in the film industry at the time.\n\n===Filming===\nVon Trier initially wanted to film it on the west coast of Jutland, then in Norway, then in Ostende, Belgium, then Ireland before finally settling with Scotland.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The exterior scenes were shot in Scotland: the graveyard was built for the film on [[Isle of Skye]]; the church is in [[Lochailort]], the harbour in [[Mallaig]], and the beach in [[Morar]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Breaking the Waves (1996) |url=http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movIes/fwaves.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311024842/http://www.scotlandthemovie.com/movIes/fwaves.html |archive-date=11 March 2010 |website=Scotland: the Movie Location Guide}}</ref> Von Trier chose the Isle of Skye because it was popular with 19th century English romantic painters and writers.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The interiors were shot at Det Danske Filmstudie in [[Lyngby]], [[Denmark]].\n\n===Music===\nEnd of film credits:\n# \u2018\u2018[[All the Way from Memphis]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Mott the Hoople]]\n# \u2018\u2018 [[Blowin' in the Wind]]\u2019\u2018 \u2013 Tom Harboe, Jan Harboe & Ulrik Corlin\n# \u2018\u2018Pipe Major Donald MacLean\u2019\u2018 \u2013 Peter Roderick MacLeod\n# \u2018\u2018[[In a Broken Dream]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Python Lee Jackson]], featuring [[Rod Stewart]]\n#  \u2018\u2018[[Cross-Eyed Mary]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]\n#  \u2018\u2018[[I Did What I Did for Maria]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Tony Christie]]\n# \u2018\u2018[[Virginia Plain]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Roxy Music]]\n# \u2018\u2018[[Whiter Shade of Pale]]\u2018\u2018 \u2013 [[Procol Harum]]\n# \u2018\u2018[[Hot Love (T.

Each chapter begins with a different impressionistically filmed panorama title frame featuring early 1970s rock music interludes. Each of these chapters is filmed with a motionless camera, but features movement in the panorama. In the original released film, the epilogue, \"The Funeral,\" features [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars]],\" which was replaced by [[Elton John]]'s \"[[Your Song]]\" on early home video releases; the more recent Criterion edition restores the Bowie song. The overall style is heavily influenced by the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[Dogme 95]] movement, of which von Trier was a founding member, and its grainy images and hand-held photography give it the superficial aesthetic of a Dogme film. However, the Dogme rules demand the use of real locations, whereas many of the locations in ''Breaking the Waves'' were constructed in a studio.<ref>{{Cite web|title=breaking the waves|url=https://pekka.nu/jarrod-witts-eagmw/breaking-the-waves|access-date=2021-08-17|website=pekka.nu|language=en}}</ref>{{Better citation needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=September 2022}} In addition, the film is set in the past and contains dubbed music, as well as a brief scene featuring CGI, none of which is permitted by the Dogme rules.\n\nSome saw ''Breaking the Waves'' as mainstream cinema. Others saw it as a high budget experimental film due to its elaborate chapter shots and handheld camera in a sketchy raw style that followed the actors closely.\n''Breaking the Waves'' marked an important change in focus for Lars von Trier. In von Trier's early films, the protagonist is a man, typically a disillusioned idealist whose downfall is furthered by a deceitful, fatal woman.  In this film, for the first time the protagonist is a woman, emotional and naive. This motif continues in his later films, except for the comedy ''[[The Boss of It All]]''.\n''Breaking the Waves'' controversially connects religion with phallocentrism. The film focuses on sexual perversity and female martyrdom, issues that continue in Trier's later work. Some critics see the self-sacrificing submissive heroine as a misogynist cliche.<ref>Lars von Trier: The Early Years, by Associate Professor Peter Schepelern</ref>\n\nThe film was made using [[Panavision]] equipment. The low-res look of the scenes was obtained by transferring the film to video, and then back to film again. According to von Trier, \"what we did was take a style and lay it like a filter over the story. It's like decoding a television signal when you pay to see a film. Here we encoded the film, and the audience has to decode it. The raw, documentary style that I imposed on the film, which actually dissolves and contradicts it, means that we can accept the story as it is.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Bj\u00f6rkman |first=Stig |date=18 April 2014 |title=Lars von Trier on ''Breaking the Waves'' |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3135-lars-von-trier-on-breaking-the-waves |access-date=12 September 2015 |work=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film garnered an 85% approval rating, and an average rating of 8.24/10 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 59 reviews.
