The film is an adaptation of the autobiographical chapters from the best selling [[Private Parts (book)|1993 book of the same name]] by radio personality [[Howard Stern]], developed from a script by [[Len Blum]] and Michael Kalesniko. It follows Stern's life from boyhood and his rise to success in radio. Stern and several of [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] star as themselves, including newscaster and co-host [[Robin Quivers]], producers [[Fred Norris]] and [[Gary Dell'Abate]], and comedian [[Jackie Martling]]. The film also stars [[Mary McCormack]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Paul Giamatti]].\n\nAfter a proposed film featuring Stern as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]] fell through, development for a new film began in 1994, several months after ''Private Parts'' was released. Stern signed with [[Rysher Entertainment]], who agreed to fund its production, and teamed with Reitman who thought a biographical take on Stern's life was best suited for a film. Production was delayed after Stern rejected 22 scripts from several screenwriters until he accepted one developed by Blum and Kalesniko in late 1995. Filming took place in the [[New York City]] area and [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1996 with a budget of $28&nbsp;million, during which Stern continued to host his radio show each weekday morning. Numerous celebrities and family members of the radio show staff make [[cameo appearances]] in the film. The soundtrack is formed of songs from several rock bands as well as two original tracks featuring Stern performing with [[Rob Zombie]] and the [[Dust Brothers]].\n\nThe film premiered on February 27, 1997, at [[The Theater at Madison Square Garden]] and theatrically released on March 7 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It debuted at number one on the US [[box office]] in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6&nbsp;million and earned a domestic total of $41.2&nbsp;million. It received mostly positive reviews from film critics, a group whom Stern made a conscious effort to please, including those who did not listen to the radio show or were not fans of his. In 1998, the film was released on DVD and Stern won a Blockbuster Award for Favorite Male Newcomer for his performance. Stern shot additional scenes for a censored version of the film prior to its premiere television broadcast on the [[USA Network]] in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his appearance at the [[MTV Music Video Awards]] as his superhero character [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]], radio personality [[Howard Stern]] boards his flight home and finds himself seated next to a stranger named Gloria who is visibly repelled by him. Stern, thinking she sees him as a moron, begins to tell his life story, starting with the verbal abuse he received as a boy from his father Ben. As a youngster, Stern dreams of being on the radio after visiting his father's recording studio and grows up to be a quiet, socially awkward teenager. He decides to work in radio and studies communications at [[Boston University]]. He becomes a DJ at [[WTBU (college radio)|WTBU]], the college station, and meets his girlfriend Alison.\n\nAfter graduating, Howard works at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] and is promoted to program director, which allows him to marry Alison. He leaves after being asked to fire a fellow DJ and moves to [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he befriends DJ [[Fred Norris]]. Howard adopts a more casual attitude on the air, becoming more open and upfront. He and Fred attend the premiere of actress Brittany Fairchild's new film. The three leave early for Fairchild's hotel room, where she strips for a bath and convinces Howard and Fred to join in. Brittany's behavior becomes more sexual, and an embarrassed Howard leaves. When Alison finds his wet underwear in their car and believes he has been unfaithful, she leaves him. Howard leaves Hartford for [[WLLZ (FM)|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] and is miserable, but Alison goes to Detroit and forgives him. WWWW then switches to country music, and Howard quits.\n\nHoward starts at [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1981 and meets his news anchor [[Robin Quivers]], whom he encourages to riff with him on the air. They refuse orders from boss Dee Dee for constantly breaking format. One of their antics, in which Howard assists a female caller to reach orgasm, almost gets him fired until a ratings boost forces Dee Dee to keep him and hire Fred to the team. Meanwhile, Alison announces her pregnancy, but it ends in [[miscarriage]]. Although they cheer each other up by joking about it, Howard makes light of the situation on the air, which greatly upsets Alison.\n\nWith Alison pregnant again, Howard gets his dream offer to work in [[New York City]] at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]], where he has the chance to become a nationwide success. However, upper management at [[NBC]] hired Howard not realizing what his show was like until they see a news report about him. Program director Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton offers to keep Howard in line or he will force him to quit. Howard, Fred, and Robin ignore Kenny's restrictions on content until a risque Match Game with comedian [[Jackie Martling]] causes Rushton to fire Robin. The show fails in her absence and her replacement quits after Howard's interview with an actress who swallows a kielbasa sausage. Robin is eventually brought back, but Howard's antics continue with a naked woman in the studio, resulting in Kenny cutting off the broadcast. Howard gets the show back on the air and gets into a physical altercation with Kenny in his office.\n\nIn 1985, Howard becomes number one at WNBC and Kenny tries to gain Howard's friendship but is turned down flat. Howard thanks his fans with an outdoor concert by [[AC/DC]]. During the performance, Alison is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to a daughter. Back on the flight, it is revealed that Howard has told his story to Gloria and believes he could get her, but remains faithful to Alison. He meets Alison at the airport and his daughters run to greet him.\n\nDuring the end credits, [[John Melendez|Stuttering John]] rants about his absence in the film. [[Mia Farrow]] then presents an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Howard at the awards ceremony, who appears as Fartman once again, but Howard falls from mid-air and the audience applauds. Kenny is out of radio and now manages a shopping mall in [[Alabama]] and blames Howard for his downfall. During his outbursts, his swearing is drowned out by jackhammer noises.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Howard Stern]] as Himself / The Narrator\n** Bobby Boriello as 7-year-old Howard\n** Michael Maccarone as 12-year-old Howard\n** Matthew Friedman as 16-year-old Howard\n* [[Robin Quivers]] as Herself\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Alison Stern\n* [[Fred Norris]] as Himself\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Kenny \"Pig Vomit\" Rushton\n* [[Carol Alt]] as Gloria\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dee Dee\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Roger Elick\n* [[Jenna Jameson]] as Mandy\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Sales Manager\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Ben Stern\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Ray Stern\n* Sasha Martin as Emily Beth Stern\n* [[Sarah Hyland]] as Debra Jennifer Stern\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Vin Vallesecca\n* Melanie Good as Brittany Fairchild\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as the WNBC Page / Tour Guide\n* [[Camille Donatacci|Camille Donatacci Grammer]] as Camille, The Card Girl\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Alison's Friend\n* [[Amber Smith]] as Julie\n* [[Janine Lindemulder]] as Camp Director's Wife\n* [[Michael C.

The film, which was budgeted between $8\u2013$11&nbsp;million, was expected to go into production in May 1993 with [[David Permut]] assigned as producer under his Permut Presentations banner. According to Lawton, ''The Adventures of Fartman'' revolved around the superhero and his alter ego, a magazine publisher in the mold of ''[[Screw magazine|Screw]]'' magazine's [[Al Goldstein]].<ref>[https://www.variety.com/article/VR101587.html?categoryid=23&cs=1 Lawton directs Stern in wind-breaking film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422005601/http://www.variety.com/article/VR101587.html?categoryid=23&cs=1 |date=April 22, 2008 }} variety.com, November 25, 1992</ref> On June 28, 1993, Lawton revealed more information for ''Time''. \"There's a lot of nudity, some harsh language, a lesbian love scene, and the main character works for an underground sex magazine.

It became the fastest selling book in publisher [[Simon & Schuster]]'s history after five days of release.

Siskel concluded his review by singling out the scenes of Stern courting Alison, his eagerness to have a baby, and his apology to Alison as \"signature moments\" of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-07/entertainment/9703070167_1_howard-stern-kama-sutra-love-story|title=Love story endearing in 'Parts'|first=Gene|last=Siskel|date=March 7, 1997|access-date=August 28, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|archive-date=December 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226190022/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-07/entertainment/9703070167_1_howard-stern-kama-sutra-love-story|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the film for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', giving it three stars out of four. He said that the film has enough to satisfy the diehard Stern fans and appeal to the general audience at the same time, and he praised Stern and Quivers for playing \"convincing, engaging versions of themselves\" in their feature film debut, something he claims even \"seasoned actors\" claim is difficult. Ebert noted Thomas's directing skills made the film play out like a film and not a series of filmed radio broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/private-parts-1997|title=Private Parts|date=March 7, 1997|publisher=RogerEbert.com|first=Roger|last=Ebert|access-date=August 28, 2016|archive-date=August 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828222610/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/private-parts-1997|url-status=live}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review, calling the film \"a lean, crisp and very entertaining picture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/1997/film/reviews/private-parts-1200449335/ |title=Review: 'Private Parts' |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |date=March 8, 1997 |work=Variety |access-date=August 29, 2016 |archive-date=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818122144/http://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/private-parts-1200449335/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 73% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10.
