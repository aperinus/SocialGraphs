The picture stars an ensemble cast that features [[Angela Bassett]], [[Edie Falco]], [[Jane Alexander]], [[Alan King]], [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Bill Cobbs]], and others. It was filmed on [[Amelia Island, Florida]], which includes settings in historic Fernandina Beach.  For her performance in the film, Falco received the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nSet in a small town in northern [[Florida]], the main two intertwining stories focus on two women at crucial points in their lives, and also comments on such issues as race relations and commercial property development.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the primarily white town of Delrona Beach, Florida, is preparing for its annual festival, one of the parade floats is set afire. A young black boy named Terrell is found guilty of the deed, and he is sentenced to community service with a local community theater.  An [[orphan]], Terrell is in the care of an elderly relative, Eunice Stokes, who lives in the neighboring, primarily black community of Lincoln Beach.\n\nEunice is being visited by her actress daughter, Desiree, a former beauty queen who left town while she was still in high school. At the time, she caused a scandal because she was pregnant by her boyfriend and her parents sent her to live with an aunt in Georgia until the baby came. She has returned to make amends to her mother and also to introduce her new husband, Reggie. While in town, she becomes reacquainted with her old high-school paramour, Flash, who was a star football player and is now a promoter for a property development scheme.\n\nBack in Delrona Beach, Marly Temple runs a motel and cafe owned by her elderly father and drama-instructor mother. Marly feels shackled by the arrangement and is tempted to sell the hotel to developers, but she assumes  her father will never agree. Marly wanted to be a marine biologist and was once an underwater performer, but when her twin older brothers died in an accident, she reluctantly became her father's heir. Marly must also deal with her former husband, Steve, a slacker who is always looking to make some quick money. Marly additionally has a boyfriend, Scotty, who is struggling to become a golf pro and travel the tour circuit. Marly then becomes romantically involved with Jack, a landscape architect affiliated with the property developers.\n\nOffering commentary on the story are a group of golfers, who act as an updated iteration of the [[Greek chorus]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* Alex Lewis as Terrell Wilkins\n* [[Alan King]] as Murray Silver\n* [[Cullen Douglas]] as Jefferson Cash\n* [[Clifton James]] as Buster Bidwell\n* [[Eliot Asinof]] as Silent Sam\n* [[James McDaniel]] as Reggie Perry\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Desiree Stokes Perry\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Marly Temple\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Jack Meadows\n* [[Perry Lang]] as Greg\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Lester\n* [[Gordon Clapp]] as Earl Pinkney\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Francine Pinkney\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Dr. Elton Lloyd\n* [[Mary Alice]] as Mrs. Eunice Stokes\n* [[Michael Greyeyes]] as Billy Trucks\n* [[Sam McMurray]] as Todd Northrup\n* Tim Powell as Buyer\n* [[Brett Rice]] as Buyer #2\n* [[Marc Blucas]] as Scotty Duval\n* [[Charlayne Woodard]] as Loretta\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Lee \"Flash\" Phillips\n* [[Ralph Waite]] as Furman Temple\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Steve Tregaskis\n* [[Jane Alexander]] as Delia Temple\n* Ashley Brumby as April\n{{Col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\nJohn Sayles wrote the script for the film with Edie Falco and Angela Bassett in mind, the latter whom he had previously worked with on ''[[City of Hope (film)|City of Hope]]'' and ''[[Passion Fish]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2002-06-17 |title=Just a Storyteller |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/home/06-17-02/ftr-sayles.html |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=Gadfly Online}}</ref>\n\n''Sunshine State'' was filmed on Florida's [[Amelia Island]], which is located 30 or so miles north of Jacksonville.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sunshine State : Production Notes |url=https://www.cinema.com/articles/2077/sunshine-state-production-notes.phtml |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=www.cinema.com}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nOn review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Sunshine State'' has an approval rating of 80% based on 110 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sunshine State |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sunshine_state |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> \n\nIn a positive review, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote the film \"may be the most far-reaching civics lesson ever crammed into a 2-hour-21-minute film.
