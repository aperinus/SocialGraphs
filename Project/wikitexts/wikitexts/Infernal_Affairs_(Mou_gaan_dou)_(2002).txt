Jointly written by Mak and [[Felix Chong]], it stars [[Andy Lau]], [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]], [[Eric Tsang]], [[Sammi Cheng]] and [[Kelly Chen]]. The film follows an undercover Hong Kong Police Force officer who infiltrates a [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]], and another officer who is secretly a [[Espionage|spy]] for the same Triad. It is the first in the [[Infernal Affairs (film series)|''Infernal Affairs'' series]] and is followed by ''[[Infernal Affairs II]]'' and ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]''.\n\nThe film was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the [[76th Academy Awards]] but was not nominated. [[Miramax Films]] acquired the United States distribution rights and gave it a limited US theatrical release in 2004. [[Martin Scorsese]] remade the film in 2006 as ''[[The Departed]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] as well as [[Academy Award for Best Director]], Scorsese\u2019s first and only Oscar in his career, and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. In 2017,  an Indian remake of the film was also planned.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/2017/film/asia/warner-azure-for-india-remake-of-infernal-affairs-1202569726/ | title=Warner, Azure Partner for India Remake of 'Infernal Affairs'| date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nHon Sam, a [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] boss, sends Lau Kin-ming, a young gangster, to the police academy to serve as his [[Espionage|spy]] in the [[Hong Kong Police Force]]. Around the same time, Chan Wing-Yan, a young police cadet, is seemingly expelled from the police academy. In reality, Chan has secretly become an undercover cop reporting only to Superintendent Wong Chi-shing, who sends him to infiltrate Hon's triad. Over the course of ten years, Chan experiences great stress from his undercover work while Lau quickly rises through the ranks in the police force, eventually becoming a Senior Inspector. Wong and his team interrupt a deal between Hon and a Thai cocaine dealer after receiving a tip-off from Chan. However, Lau alerts Hon, giving him enough time to get his henchmen to dispose of the evidence. \n\nAfter this incident, both Wong and Hon realise that they have a spy within their own organisation, placing them in a race against time to find out who the spy is. Chan nearly finds out Lau's identity when he tries to follow Lau after seeing him talking to Hon in a cinema; Lau manages to get away before Chan could see his face. By this time, both Chan and Lau are struggling with their double identities \u2013 Chan starts losing faith in himself as a cop after being a gangster for ten years; Lau becomes more accustomed to the life of a police officer and wants to end his association with the triad. At their next meeting on a rooftop, Wong wants to pull Chan out of undercover work for fear of his safety. \n\nHowever, Hon, who knows about the meeting from Lau, sends \"Crazy\" Keung and other henchmen to confront them. Chan escapes from the building while Wong tries to distract the gangsters and ends up being thrown off the roof to his death. Just then, the police show up and a shootout ensues. Keung, not knowing that Chan is the mole, drives them away from the scene but dies from a gunshot wound later. When the news report that Keung is actually an undercover cop, Hon assumes that he was the spy and that Chan killed him to protect himself. Lau retrieves Wong's cell phone and contacts Chan; both of them agree to foil a drug deal by Hon. The plan succeeds and many of Hon's men are arrested, while Lau betrays and kills Hon. \n\nEverything seems to have returned to normal \u2013 Chan can revert to his true identity as a cop, while Lau has erased his criminal connections by eliminating the triad. However, back at the police headquarters, Chan discovers that Lau was the spy and leaves immediately. Realising what has happened, Lau erases Chan's file from the police database and makes a copy on his personal computer, intending to use the proof of Chan's identity as leverage, so that he would not reveal his real identity. Chan sends to Lau a compact disc with a recording that Hon kept between himself and Lau. The disc inadvertently ends up in the hands of Lau's girlfriend, Mary. Chan and Lau meet on the same rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau and holds his pistol to Lau's head; Lau states calmly that he \"wants to be a good person\" now, but Chan rejects Lau's plea to help him conceal his criminal past. \n\nInspector \"Big B\" arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into an elevator, but gets shot in the head by \"Big B\" when he moves his head from behind Lau. \"Big B\" then reveals to Lau that he is also a spy planted by Hon in the police force, and assures Lau that he has destroyed evidence of Lau's criminal associations. When they take the elevator to the ground floor, Lau kills \"Big B\". Lee discovers records that prove Chan's identity as an undercover cop, while \"Big B\" is identified as the spy in the police force and the case is closed. Lau salutes Chan at his funeral, with Cheung and Lee present as well. A flashback reaffirms the point that Lau wished he had taken a different route in life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andy Lau]] as Senior Inspector Lau Kin-ming (\u5289\u5065\u660e), Hon's spy in the police force.\n** [[Edison Chen]] as young Lau Kin-ming\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] as Chan Wing-yan (\u9673\u6c38\u4ec1), an undercover cop in Hon's triad.\n** [[Shawn Yue]] as young Chan Wing-yan\n* [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as Superintendent Wong Chi-shing (\u9ec3\u5fd7\u8aa0), Chan's superior.\n* [[Eric Tsang]] as Hon Sam (\u97d3\u741b), the triad boss and main antagonist.\n* [[Chapman To]] as \"Silly\" Keung (\u50bb\u5f37), Hon's henchman.\n* [[Gordon Lam]] as Inspector B (\u5927B; Big B), Lau's subordinate who is also a mole in the police force.\n* [[Sammi Cheng]] as Mary, Lau's fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Kelly Chen]] as Lee Sum-yee (\u674e\u5fc3\u5152), Chan's psychiatrist.\n* [[Berg Ng]] as Senior Inspector Cheung (\u5f35Sir), Wong's subordinate.\n* [[Wan Chi Keung|Wan Chi-keung]] as Officer Leung (\u6881Sir), the chief superintendent of the internal affairs department.\n* [[Dion Lam]] as Del Piero (\u8fea\u8def), Hon's henchman.\n* [[Elva Hsiao]] as May, Chan's ex-girlfriend.\n* Hui Kam-fung as Officer Yip (\u8449Sir), Chan's cadet school principal\n\n==Alternate ending==\nAn alternate ending for the film was shot in order to comply with Article 25 (7) of the Chinese Film Administration Regulations specifying that films cannot propagate obscenity, gambling or violence, or abet to commit crimes.<ref>S. Xu (2017) \u201cThe Curious Case of Chinese Film Censorship: an Analysis of the Film Administration Regulations\u201d. School of Journalism and Communication and the Graduate School of the University of Oregon. 32-44.</ref> In the original (Hong Kong) ending, Lau concealed his true identity as a Triad spy and identified himself as a police officer to avoid legislative punishment. Therefore, the original ending version promotes criminal activity and injustice, and an alternate ending was filmed in order to access the market of mainland China. In the alternate ending, inspector Cheung discovered evidence of Lau\u2019s criminal activity and immediately arrested Lau outside the elevator. This alternate ending was shown in mainland China and Malaysia.<ref name=\"doi.org\">H. Y. F. Choy (2007) \u201cSchizophrenic Hong Kong: Postcolonial Identity Crisis in the Infernal Affairs Trilogy\u201d. Transtext(e)s Transcultures. 3: 52\u201366. https://doi.org/10.4000/transtexts.138</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Postcolonial identity crisis in Hong Kong===\nIn ''Infernal Affairs'', the [[identity crisis]] suffered by both Chan and Lau as a mole is hinting at the schizophrenic struggle of Hong Kong residents, who faced both the [[colonization]] by the British and the [[reunification]] with Mainland China. Specifically, under [[Deng Xiaoping]]\u2019s \"One Country, Two System policy\", the duplicity, unsettling, and uncertain nature of the future of Hong Kong residents is tightly echoed in Chan and Lau\u2019s character developments. Scholar Howard Y. F. Choy further claimed that \u201cthis postcolonial (re)turn is actually more a recolonization than a decolonization of the capitalist Cantonese city by the mainland Mandarin master.\u201d<ref name=\"doi.org\"/>\n\n===Quotes from Buddha===\n''Infernal Affairs'' opens with [[Buddhist]] classic Nirvana Sutra Verse Nineteen, stating that \u201cThe worst of the Eight Hells is called Continuous Hell. It has the meaning of Continuous Suffering. Thus the name.\u201d The film also closes with another quote from [[Buddha]], stating that \u201cHe who is in Continuous Hell never dies. Longevity is a big hardship in Continuous Hell.\u201d In [[Buddhism]], Continuous Hell is also termed The [[Avici]], where one can never reincarnate nor be relieved from guilt and suffering. This concept of timeless, placeless, and endless suffering especially applies to the character Lau throughout the trilogy, who infinitely bears the burden of self-betrayal (serves as a mole), loss of family and friendship, and unsettledness.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nUpon its premiere in Hong Kong, ''Infernal Affairs'' grossed $160,356 during the opening day (January 16\u201319).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/?rf=cons_tt_atf&ref_=cons_tt_atf.htm | title=Infernal Affairs (2002) - IMDB Pro | website=www.pro.imdb.com | language=en | access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> In total, the film grossed $7,035,649 during its run in Hong Kong theatres.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2170258945/weekend/.htm | title=Infernal Affairs (2004) \u2013 Infernal Affairs (2004) \u2013 Box Office Mojo | website=www.boxofficemojo.com | language=en | access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref> The film was then released across Asia, where it grossed a further $169,659 from theatre receipts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/?rf=cons_tt_atf&ref_=cons_tt_atf.htm | title=Infernal Affairs (2002) - IMDB Pro | website=www.pro.imdb.com | language=en | access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> In 2016, South Korean theaters re-released the film, which went on to gross $128,026 across three weeks.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/?rf=cons_tt_atf&ref_=cons_tt_atf.htm | title=Infernal Affairs (2002) - IMDB Pro | website=www.pro.imdb.com | language=en | access-date=2020-06-10}}</ref> The total lifetime gross of the film in Korea is $977,903.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2170258945/weekend/.htm | title=Infernal Affairs (2004) \u2013 Box Office Mojo | website=Box Office Mojo | language=en | access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIn total, worldwide, the film grossed $8,836,958 across release in both domestic markets and European theatres which displayed the film.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Infernal Affairs'' has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 64 critics, with an average rating of 7.50/10.

Before ''Infernal Affairs'', there were few serious and artistic works in Hong Kong films, but they basically had the following characteristics:\n1. The relative roughness of the production was compensated for by the skill of the practitioners\n2. Hong Kong films incorporate a lot of dramatic elements.\nAfter the release of ''Infernal Affairs'', Hong Kong films began to pay attention to the plot and picture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/9736539a0408763231126edb6f1aff00bed57084.html?fr=search-1-wk_sea_vipX-income6&fixfr=VOZemyIHIioFlMs8t5K4ZA%3D%3D.htm|title=How do you evaluate the influence of the Infernal Affairs trilogy on Hong Kong films?|access-date=2021-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===The Artistry of the ''Infernal Affairs'' title===\n\"Insanity\" refers to the Insanity Hell, and in the Buddhist view, those who enter the Insanity Hell are extremely sinful. Those who enter the Infinite Hell never have any hope of relief, and they have no other feeling out of suffering. Those who enter the Infinite Hell will forever be tortured in Hell as retribution for the wickedness of their previous lives. The title perfectly sums up the plot described in ''Infernal Affairs''. Two identities should not belong to their own people, as they live in a similar hell of the environment; the dream is afraid of others who expose their undercover identity. Both of them are trying to use their own hated identities to hide their real identity. Their position in tandem with their identity force them to be tortured all the time, which perfectly fits the Buddhist-influenced title.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Ouyang|first1=Chun|title=The artistic value of infernal affairs|url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/9a470f5777232f60ddcca130.html?fr=search&fixfr=d6eDRw2hKZUpvgUzjxESPw%3D%3D.|access-date=2021-06-10}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hong Kong|Film}}\n* [[Infernal Affairs (film series)|''Infernal Affairs'' film series]]\n* [[Cinema of Hong Kong]]\n* [[List of Hong Kong films]]\n* [[Andy Lau filmography]]\n* [[List of films featuring surveillance]]\n* [[List of films set in Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0338564}}\n* {{mojo title|infernalaffairs}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|infernal_affairs}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Infernal Affairs}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Related topics|state=collapsed\n|list1=\n{{Andrew Lau}}\n{{Alan Mak}}\n{{Blue Ribbon Award for Best Foreign Film}}\n{{GoldenHorseAwardBestFilm}}\n{{Golden Horse Award for Audience Choice}}\n{{Best Film HKFA}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Internal Affairs}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong New Wave films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong police films]]\n[[Category:2000s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrew Lau]]\n[[Category:Best Film HKFA]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2002]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Golden Horse Award]]\n[[Category:Police detective films]]\n[[Category:Triad films]]\n[[Category:Basic Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Media Asia films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alan Mak]]\n[[Category:Chinese New Year films]]\n[[Category:Fictional rivalries]]\n[[Category:2000s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
