It was written for the screen by [[Randi Mayem Singer]] and [[Leslie Dixon]], based on the 1987 novel ''[[Madame Doubtfire|Alias Madame Doubtfire]]'' by [[Anne Fine]]. [[Robin Williams]], who also served as a producer, stars with [[Sally Field]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Harvey Fierstein]], and [[Robert Prosky]]. It follows a recently divorced actor who dresses up as a female housekeeper to be able to interact with his children. The film addresses themes of divorce, separation, and the effect they have on a family.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 24, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mrsdoubtfire.htm|title=Mrs. Doubtfire|publisher=Box Office Mojo|language=en|date=24 November 1993|access-date=20 September 2016|archive-date=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116220919/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mrsdoubtfire.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]<ref name=awardformrsdoubtfire>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107614/awards Awards for Mrs. Doubtfire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920174944/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107614/awards |date=2017-09-20 }}.

Robin Williams was awarded the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]].\n\nIt grossed $441.3&nbsp;million on a $25&nbsp;million budget, making it the [[1993 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 1993]]. Although the film received mixed reviews on release, its reception and popularity have since improved considerably, being placed 67th in the [[American Film Institute]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]]\" list and 40th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s \"100 Funniest Movies of All Time\" list. The original music score was composed by [[Howard Shore]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be 400 to 700 words only. -->\nDaniel Hillard is a freelance [[voice actor]] living in [[San Francisco]]. Though a devoted father to his three children\u201414-year-old Lydia, 12-year-old Chris, and 5-year-old Natalie\u2014his wife Miranda considers him unreliable. One day, Daniel quits his job following  a disagreement over a morally questionable script and returns home to throw a chaotic birthday party for Chris, despite Miranda's objections. This infuriates Miranda to the point where she files for divorce. At their first custody hearing, the court grants sole custody of the children to Miranda; shared custody is contingent on whether Daniel finds a steady job and a suitable residence within three months.\n\nAs Daniel works to rebuild his life, securing himself an apartment and a new job as a shipping clerk at a TV station, he learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper. He secretly alters her classified ad form, then calls Miranda while using his voice acting skills to pose as a series of undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as \"Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire\", an elderly British nanny with strong credentials, taking his last name from a newspaper headline titled \"Police '''Doubt Fire''' was Accidental\". Miranda is impressed and invites Mrs. Doubtfire for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank, a makeup artist, and Frank's domestic partner, Jack, to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an old woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire following a successful interview. The children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority but soon come around and thrive and Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this later creates another barrier for him to see his children, as Miranda puts more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him and cannot bring herself to dismiss her. Lydia and Chris later discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel, but agree to keep his secret.\n\nOne day, the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy sees Daniel playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a recently cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel to discuss his plans for the show over dinner, which turns out to be at the same place and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her new boyfriend Stu Dunmeyer, to which Mrs. Doubtfire is invited. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel changes in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events. Becoming drunk, Daniel slips up when he accidentally returns to Lundy in his costume, but he quickly claims that Mrs. Doubtfire is his idea for the new show. After overhearing that Stu is allergic to pepper, Daniel sneaks into the kitchen and seasons Stu's order of [[jambalaya]] with powdered [[cayenne pepper]]. Stu chokes on his dinner, and Daniel, feeling guilty, administers the [[Heimlich maneuver]] as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda, who storms out of the restaurant with the kids.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, then explains his actions. The judge, noting Daniel's acting abilities, dismisses his words as another act and, finding his role as Mrs. Doubtfire unorthodox, grants Miranda full custody of the kids and further restricts Daniel's rights to supervised Saturday visits, which devastates him and Miranda. Without Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much \"she\" improved their lives. They are then surprised to discover that Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, is hosting a new children's show called ''Euphegenia's House'', which becomes a nationwide hit.\n\nMiranda visits Daniel on set after filming and admits that things were better when he was involved with the family. She then arranges joint custody, allowing Daniel as himself to take the children after school. As Daniel leaves with the kids, Miranda watches an episode of ''Euphegenia's House'' in which Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl, Katie McCormick, whose parents have separated, saying that no matter what arrangements families have, love will prevail.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel Hillard / Euphegenia Doubtfire\n* [[Sally Field]] as Miranda Hillard\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Frank Hillard\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Gloria Chaney\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Lydia Hillard\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Christopher \"Chris\" Hillard\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Natalie Hillard\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Jonathan Lundy\n* [[Anne Haney]] as Mrs. Sellner\n* [[Scott Capurro]] as Jack\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Justin Gregory\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Mr. Sprinkles\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Blake Lively]] unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Natalie Hilliard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/hilarious-embarrassing-and-awful-celebrity-audition-stories.php|title = 11 of the Funniest, Most Embarrassing, and Downright Awful Celebrity Audition Stories|date = 9 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Warren Beatty]] was Anne Fine\u2019s first choice for the role of Daniel Hillard / Mrs. Doubtfire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/mrs-doubtfire-robin-williams-25th-anniversary-sally-field-home-alone-a8648401.html|title=Why MRS Doubtfire is more than just a panto comedy|website=[[Independent.co.uk]]|date=26 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Tim Allen]] was offered the roles of Daniel Hillard and Stu but turned both of them down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/9597-13-facts-you-didnt-know-about-mrs-doubtfire|title = 13 Facts You Didn't Know About 'MRS.

This resulted in cinemas requesting their local authorities to override the decision of the [[British Board of Film Classification]], after having to turn down disappointed families. Later in February, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the censors refused to give the film a U or PG certificate, and gave it a 12 instead, which was due to [[20th Century Fox]] refusing to remove three controversial lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/film-stars-lost-for-words-but-why-does-mrs-doubtfire-have-to-swear-asks-david-lister-1393822.html|title=Film stars lost for words: But why does Mrs Doubtfire have to swear? asks David Lister|website=[[Independent.co.uk]]|access-date=11 March 2016|date=13 February 1994|archive-date=11 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311191929/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/film-stars-lost-for-words-but-why-does-mrs-doubtfire-have-to-swear-asks-david-lister-1393822.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAfter the film's distributors requested the BBFC to reconsider, a compromise was reached and the film was re-rated PG, with just one of the proposed three cuts implemented involving the removal of thirteen seconds featuring sexual innuendo (the other two cuts would have removed just some of the innuendo), and it was re-released in May 1994. The cut version was also used in subsequent [[VHS]] and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] releases in the United Kingdom. In November 2012 the distributors resubmitted the uncut version to the BBFC and the 12 certificate was reinstated for home video along with a [[History of British film certificates#2002\u2013present|12A certificate]] for cinema release in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=MRS.
