The screenplay by [[Horton Foote]] focuses on Mac Sledge, a recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[country music]] singer who seeks to turn his life around through his relationship with a young widow and her son in rural [[Texas]]. [[Robert Duvall]] plays the role of Mac; the supporting cast includes [[Tess Harper]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[Wilford Brimley]], [[Ellen Barkin]] and Allan Hubbard.\n\nFinanced by [[EMI Films]], ''Tender Mercies'' was shot largely in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. The script was rejected by several American directors before the Australian Beresford accepted it. Duvall, who sang his own songs in the film, drove more than {{convert|600|mi|km|0}} throughout the state, tape recording local accents and playing in country music bands to prepare for the role. He and Beresford repeatedly clashed during production, at one point prompting the director to walk off the set and reportedly consider quitting the film.\n\nThe film encompasses several themes, including the importance of love and family, the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death and the concept of redemption through Mac Sledge's conversion to [[Christianity]]. Following poor [[test screening]] results, distributor [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] made little effort to publicise ''Tender Mercies'', which Duvall attributed to the studio's lack of understanding of country music.\n\nThe film was released on March 4, 1983, in a limited number of theatres. Although unsuccessful at the box office, it was critically acclaimed and earned five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including one for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. ''Tender Mercies'' won Oscars for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] for Foote and Duvall won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nMac Sledge ([[Robert Duvall]]), a washed-up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee ([[Tess Harper]]), and offers to perform maintenance work at the motel in exchange for a room. Rosa, whose husband was killed in the [[Vietnam War]], is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay on condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for each other, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing parts of their life stories.\n\nMac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After enough days of keeping his word and doing his work, he is comfortable enough in his new life that he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and if he has deliberately chosen to lead an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about him and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott ([[Betty Buckley]]), a country music star who is performing nearby.\n\nAfter the story is published, the neighbourhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country\u2013western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend, Harry ([[Wilford Brimley]]). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to her but she becomes angry on seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne ([[Ellen Barkin]]).\n\nOn his return home, Mac assures Rosa Lee he no longer has any feelings for Dixie, whom he describes as \"poison\" to him. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no good. Hurt and angry, Mac drives away and nearly crashes the truck.  He buys a bottle of whiskey but, returning home to a worried Rosa Lee and Sonny, he tells them he poured it out. He says he tried to leave Rosa Lee, but found he could not. Some time later, Mac and Sonny are [[baptism|baptised]] together in Rosa Lee's church.\n\nEventually, Sue Anne visits Mac\u2014their first encounter since she was a baby. Mac asks whether she got any of his letters, and she says her mother kept them from her. She also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac, and that, despite her mother's objections, she is eloping with her boyfriend. Mac admits that he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves, he sings to himself the hymn \"[[Wings of a Dove (Bob Ferguson song)|On the Wings of a Dove]],\" which refers to a dove from the Lord saving Noah, and to the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a dove at Jesus' baptism.\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=225px |align=right | quote  = I don't know why I wandered out to this part of Texas drunk, and you took me in and pitied me and helped me to straighten out, marry me.

The members of the local country band ask Mac permission to perform one of his songs, and he agrees. Mac begins performing with them and they make plans to record together. His newfound happiness is interrupted  when Sue Anne dies in a car accident. Mac attends his daughter's funeral at Dixie's lavish home in [[Nashville]] and comforts her when she breaks down. He also complains to Rosa Lee that, during their marriage, Dixie kept saying she would give up her career but never did.\n\nBack home, Mac keeps quiet about his emotional pain, although he wonders aloud to Rosa Lee why his once sorry existence has been given meaning and, on the other hand, his daughter has died. Throughout his mourning, Mac continues his new life with Rosa Lee and Sonny. In the final scene, Sonny finds a football that Mac has left as a gift for him. Mac is watching the motel from a field across the road, singing \"On the Wings of a Dove\" to himself. Sonny thanks him for the football and the two play catch together in the field.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Mac Sledge\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Rosa Lee\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Dixie\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Harry\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Sue Anne\n* Allan Hubbard as Sonny\n*[[Lenny Von Dohlen]] as Robert\n*[[Paul Gleason]] as Reporter\n*Michael Crabtree as Lewis Menefee\n*Norman Bennett as Reverend Hotchkiss\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nPlaywright Horton Foote reportedly considered giving up on film writing, due to what he regarded as a poor adaptation of his 1952 play ''The Chase'' into a [[The Chase (1966 film)|1966 film of the same name]]. Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaptation of his 1968 play ''Tomorrow'' in 1972, his interest in filmmaking was rekindled, with the condition that he maintain some degree of control over the final product. Foote said of this stage in his career, \"I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that, in theatre, the writer is, of course, very dominant&nbsp;... If we don't like something, we can speak our minds.&nbsp;... It is always a collaborative effort.&nbsp;... But in Hollywood it wasn't so. A writer there has in his contract that you are a writer for hire, which means that you write a script, then it belongs to them.\"<ref name=\"Briley107\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=107}}.</ref> This renewed interest in cinema prompted Foote to write ''Tender Mercies'', his first work written specifically for the screen.<ref name=\"CSM0310\">{{Cite news|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=Rediscovering the drama in decency and compassion|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=1983-03-10|location=[[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]|page=18, Arts/Entertainment: On Film (section)}}</ref> In the view of biographer George Terry Barr, the script reflected \"Foote's determination to battle a Hollywood system that generally refuses to make such personal films.\"<ref name=\"Briley107\" />\n\nThe story was inspired partially by Foote's nephew, who struggled to succeed in the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew's efforts to organise a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew's band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself.<ref name=\"Briley108\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=108}}.</ref> Foote said, \"This older man had been through it all. As I thought about a storyline, I got very interested in that type of character.\"<ref name=\"CSM0310\" /> The moment in the film where a woman asks, \"Were you really Mac Sledge?\" and he responds, \"Yes ma'am, I guess I was,\" was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke volumes about Mac's personality and former status.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|pp=110\u2013111}}.</ref>\n\nFoote based Sledge's victory over alcoholism on his observations of theatre people struggling with the problem. He sought to avoid a melodramatic slant in telling that aspect of the story.<ref name=\"CSM0310\" /><ref name=\"Briley108\" /> Foote described his protagonist as \"a very hurt, damaged man&nbsp;... silence was his weapon\".<ref name=\"FooteMiracles\">{{Cite AV media|people=[[Horton Foote]] (actor)|date=2002-04-16|title=Miracles & Mercies|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Blue Underground]]|location=[[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]]|access-date=2008-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002123343/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|archive-date=2018-10-02|url-status=live}}</ref> He chose the title ''Tender Mercies'', from the Book of [[Psalms]], for its relation to the Rosa Lee character, who he said seeks only \"certain moments of gentleness or respite, [not] grandness or largeness\".<ref name=\"CSM0310\"/> Foote sought to portray each character as realistic and flawed, but not unsympathetic.<ref name=\"Briley108\" /> Although the script conveyed a strong spiritual message with religious undertones, Foote felt it was important to balance those religious elements with a focus on the practical challenges of everyday life.<ref name=\"Briley111\" />\n\nFilm historian Gary Edgerton said the ''Tender Mercies'' script \"catapulted Horton Foote into the most active professional period in his life.\"<ref name=\"Briley107\" /> Film director and producer [[Alan J. Pakula]] credited the script with helping define the American [[independent film]] movement of the late 1980s by initiating a trend of personal filmmaking that often looks beyond [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] conventions.<ref name=\"Briley116\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=116}}.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nDuvall, who had appeared in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962), which Foote adapted from the [[Harper Lee]] novel, was involved in ''Tender Mercies'' as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the [[United States]] without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do.<ref name=\"DuvallMiracles\">{{Cite AV media|people=[[Robert Duvall]] (actor)|date=2002-04-16|title=Miracles & Mercies|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Blue Underground]]|location=[[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]]|access-date=2008-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002123343/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|archive-date=2018-10-02|url-status=live}}</ref> Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.<ref name=\"Briley108\" />\n\nFoote took the script to Philip and Mary Ann Hobel, a married couple who ran Antron Media Production and had produced more than 200 documentaries between them. Foote felt their background in documentaries would lend ''Tender Mercies'' the authenticity he and Duvall were seeking. The Hobels agreed to produce it after reading and liking the script; it would become their feature film debut as producers. The Hobels approached [[EMI Films]], a British film and television production company, which agreed to provide financing for ''Tender Mercies'' as long as Duvall remained involved, and under the condition the Hobels find a good director.<ref name=\"Slawson\">{{Harvnb|Slawson|1985|p=155}}.</ref> The script was rejected by many American directors, creating concerns for Foote and the producers that the film would never be made. Foote later said, \"This film was turned down by every American director on the face of the globe.\"<ref name=\"FooteMiracles\"/> The Hobels eventually mailed the script to Australian director Bruce Beresford because they were impressed by his 1980 film ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]''. Philip Hobel said, \"What we saw in ''Breaker Morant'' is what we like as filmmakers ourselves \u2014 an attention to the environment, a straightforward presentation; it's almost a documentary approach.\"<ref name=\"NYT0227\">{{Cite news |last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|author-link=Lawrence Van Gelder|title=From the Boer War, Bruce Beresford Turns to Texas Life|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1983-02-27|page=17, Arts and Leisure, Section 2}}</ref>\n\nBeresford was attracted to the idea of making a Hollywood film with a big budget and powerful distribution. Following his success with ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford received about 150 Hollywood scripts as potential projects; although he went weeks before reading many of them, Beresford read ''Tender Mercies'' right away. It immediately appealed to him, in part because it dealt with aspects of American rural life he had seldom encountered in film scripts.<ref name=\"NYT0227\"/> Several of those involved with ''Tender Mercies'' had reservations about an Australian directing a film about a country music star. Beresford also found the decision strange, but kept his thoughts to himself because of his desire to direct the film.<ref name=\"BeresfordMiracles\">{{Cite AV media|people=[[Bruce Beresford]] (actor)|date=2002-04-16|title=Miracles & Mercies|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Blue Underground]]|location=[[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]]|access-date=2008-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002123343/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/|archive-date=2018-10-02|url-status=live}}</ref> He contacted EMI Films and asked for one month to visit Texas and familiarize himself with the state before committing to direct, to which the company agreed.<ref name=\"Slaw156\">{{Harvnb|Slawson|1985|p=156}}.</ref> Beresford said of the trip, \"I want to come over and see if this is all true, because if it's not really a true picture of what it's all like, it wouldn't be right to make it.\"<ref name=\"NYT0227\"/> During his visit to Texas, he saw parallels between the state and his homeland: the terrain reminded him of the Australian [[The bush|bush country]], and the Texans he met in the isolated areas reminded him of residents of the [[Outback]]. He met Foote and discussed the script with him. The screenwriter, who gave Beresford tours of small Texas towns, felt the director's Australian background made him sensitive to the story's rural characters and would help him achieve the sought-for authenticity.<ref name=\"Slaw156\"/> Beresford agreed to direct and was hired after receiving final approval from Duvall (the actor had a clause in his contract allowing him such approval, the first time he had this power on a film).<ref name=\"NYT1025\">{{Cite news |last=Daley|first=Suzanne|title=How Duvall Masters His Many Film Faces|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1981-10-25|page=1 Arts and Leisure, Section 2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tender mercies film setting.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A flat, rural setting under a vast sky.

The town portrayed in the film is never identified by name. Foote said when he wrote the script he did not have the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.<ref name=\"FooteMiracles\"/><ref name=\"BeresfordMiracles\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography took place between November 2 and December 23, 1981.<ref name=\"Slaw158\"/> The plants used in the gardening scenes were brought inside at night to keep them from freezing.<ref name=\"Anker126\">{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|p=126}}.</ref> Due to the tight schedule, the cast and crew worked seven days a week with very long hours each day. Although the Australian filmmakers and the crew, who were mostly from [[Dallas]], got along very well both on and off the set,<ref name=\"Slaw158\"/> Beresford and Duvall were at odds during the production. Beresford, in his usual approach, meticulously planned each scene, and Duvall, who preferred a free-form give-and-take on set, felt restricted by the director's methods. Although Duvall regularly acknowledged his talent as a director, he said of Beresford, \"He has this dictatorial way of doing things with me that just doesn't cut it. Man, I have to have my freedom.\"<ref name=\"Slaw158\"/> Although he had no problem with Duvall's acting methodology, the actor's temperament infuriated Beresford. While filming one scene with Harper and Barkin, he became so frustrated during a phone conversation with Duvall that he said, \"Well if you want to direct the film, go right ahead,\" and walked off the set.<ref name=\"BeresfordMiracles\"/> Beresford flew to New York and reportedly was ready to quit, until Duvall flew out to speak with him. After further arguments, the two made amends and returned to work on the film.<ref name=\"Slaw158\">{{Harvnb|Slawson|1985|pp=158\u2013159}}.</ref>\n\nBeresford also clashed on set with Brimley. On the very first day of filming, he asked the actor to \"pick up the pace\", prompting Brimley to reply, \"Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it.\"<ref name=\"Slaw158\"/> On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, \"Now look, let me tell you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry.\"<ref name=\"DuvallMiracles\"/> Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.<ref name=\"BeresfordMiracles\"/>\n\nHarper described the extent to which Duvall inhabited his character: \"Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall.

Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a [[long take]] and [[long shot]] so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested [[close-up]] shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact.

He commented, \"What's the point if you're not going to do your own [singing]? They're just going to dub somebody else?

I don't know now how we got through it, but we got through it.\"<ref name=\"Jewett5859\" /> The lyrics of \"If You'll Hold the Ladder\", which Mac performs with his new country band in the second half of the film, suggest what love has done for him.

Denzin points out that ''Tender Mercies'' embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the [[twelve-step program]] used by [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.<ref>Denzin, p. 46.</ref>\n\n''Tender Mercies'' also emphasizes the father\u2013child theme common in the works of Foote, a theme that operates on both transcendent and temporal levels. Mac is reunited not only with his spiritual father through his conversion to Christianity, but also with his biological daughter, Sue Anne, when she pays him a surprise visit. Scholar Rebecca Luttrell Briley suggests that although Mac begins to plant new roots with Rosa Lee and Sonny in earlier scenes, they are not enough to fully satisfy his desire for redemption, as he is nearly driven to leave the family and return to his alcoholic ways. According to Briley, Sue Anne's visit prompts Mac to realize that reconciliation with her and a reformation of their father\u2013daughter relationship is the ingredient that had been lacking in his quest for redemption. This is further demonstrated by Mac's singing \"On the Wings of a Dove\" to himself after their meeting;<ref name=\"Anker134\">{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|p=134}}.</ref> the lyrics describe God the Father and God the Holy Spirit's involvement in the baptism of God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. This connects Sledge's spiritual reconciliation with the divine, to the earthly reconciliation with his own child.<ref name=\"Briley109\" /> However, the death of Sue Anne also demonstrates that, according to Briley, \"all relationships cannot be mended, some by choice and some by chance, and the poignancy of missed opportunities between fathers and their children on this earth is underlined in this scene.\"<ref name=\"Briley112\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=112}}.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Mac and Sonny, whose name derives from \"son\", is central to the film's exploration of the father\u2013child theme. Sonny tries to conjure an image of his biological father, whom he never had the chance to know, through old photographs, his mother's memories and visits to his father's grave. Sonny finds a father figure in Mac. When another young boy asks Sonny if he likes Mac more than his real father, Sonny says that he does, because he never knew the other man; Briley says that this \"emphasizes the distinction between companionship and blood relationship Foote has pointed out before.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|pp=114\u2013115}}.</ref> The final scene, in which Mac and Sonny play catch with a football Mac bought him as a gift, symbolizes the fact that, although Mac has lost the chance to reconcile with his daughter, he now has a second chance at establishing a father\u2013child relationship with Sonny.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=113}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|p=140}}.</ref> The father\u2013child theme also plays out through Mac's relationship with the young band members, who say that he has been an inspiration to them, playing a paternal role in their lives before they even met him. Sledge eventually teams up with the musicians, offering them fatherly counsel in a much more direct way.<ref name=\"Briley111\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=111}}.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nMac's redemption and self-improvement run parallel with his conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"Briley109\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=109}}.</ref><ref name=\"Jewett59-63\">{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|pp=59\u201363}}.</ref> Briley argues that \"the emphasis on the Christian family is stronger in this script than in any other Foote piece to this point.\"<ref name=\"Jewett59-63\" /> At the urging of Rosa Lee, Mac begins to attend church regularly and is eventually [[baptism|baptized]] for the first time, along with Sonny. During a church scene, he also sings the hymn \"Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me\", which serves as a symbol for his new direction in life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|p=59}}.</ref> After they are baptized, Sonny asks Mac whether he feels any different, to which Mac responds, \"Not yet.\" According to scholars, this response indicates Mac's belief that his reunion with God will lead to meaningful changes in his life.<ref name=\"Briley110\"/><ref name=\"Anker135\">{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|pp=135\u2013136}}.</ref> It is after this moment, Briley points out, that Mac is able to forge other relationships, such as those with his young bandmates, and \"develop his own potential for success as a man.\"<ref name=\"Briley110\">{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|p=110}}.</ref> Briley also proposes that Mac's response \u2014 \"Yes, ma'am, I guess I was\" \u2014 to a fan who asks if he was really Mac Sledge suggests that he has washed away his old self through baptism.<ref name=\"Briley111\" />\n\nDuring one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, \"I say my prayers for you and when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're at the head of the list.\" Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 12, in which [[Paul the Apostle]] appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others \"through the mercies of God\".<ref name=\"Jewett55\">{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|p=55}}.</ref> Many of the elements of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, \"This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.&nbsp;... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible.\"<ref name=\"Jewett59-63\" /> Jewett compares Mac's story to that of [[Abraham]], because \"just like Sledge's story, [it] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God\".<ref name=\"Jewett55\" /> As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife [[Sarah]] are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though \u2014 as Paul describes \u2014 Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: \"It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|pp=56\u201358}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the face of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley's words, that \"his life as a Christian is no more sheltered from this world's tragedies than it was before.\"<ref name=\"Briley112\" /> Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of [[theodicy]], the question of [[Problem of evil|why evil exists]] that is commonly faced by Christians.<ref name=\"Leonard142\">{{Harvnb|Leonard|2006|p=142}}.</ref><ref name=\"Anker137\">{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|p=137}}.</ref> Scholar Richard Leonard writes, \"For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question.&nbsp;... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events to teach us something.\"<ref name=\"Leonard142\" /> Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, \"The message of this film is that we have no final assurances, any more than Abraham did. But we can respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|p=60}}.</ref>\n\n===Death and resurrection===\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=225px |align=right | quote  = When his newly recovered relationship with Sue Anne is cut short by an automobile accident that takes her life, Mac quickly realizes that his life as a Christian is no more sheltered from this world's tragedies than it was before.

Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants.\"<ref name=\"Leonard142\" /> In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, \"Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life.\"<ref name=\"Jewett62\">{{Harvnb|Jewett|1993|p=62}}.</ref>\n\nMac is portrayed as near death at the beginning of the film, having woken up in a drunken stupor in a boundless, empty flatland with nothing in his possession, a shot that scholar Roy M. Anker said \"pointedly reflects the condition of his own soul\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Anker|2004|p=124}}.</ref> The dialogue in other scenes suggests the threat of mortality, including a moment when Mac has trouble singing due to his bad voice and says, \"Don't feel sorry for me, Rosa Lee, I'm not dead yet.\"<ref name=\"Jewett62\" /> In several lasting shots, the vast sky dwarfs Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny, starkly symbolizing their isolation, as well as the fragility of human existence.<ref name=\"Anker132\" /> The fact that Mac sustains his newfound life with Rosa Lee and Sonny after his daughter's death, rather than reverting to his old pattern of alcoholism and abuse, is consistent with a recurring theme in Foote's works of characters overcoming tragedy and finding in it an opportunity for growth and maturation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briley|1993|pp=112\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Distribution===\nPhilip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a long time seeking a distributor for ''Tender Mercies'' without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for ''[[Angelo My Love]]'', a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute ''Tender Mercies''.<ref name=\"Slaw167\">{{Harvnb|Slawson|1985|p=167}}.</ref> [[Test screening]]s for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced.

He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had \"a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end\".<ref name=\"CSM0310\"/>\n\nSome reviews were less favorable. [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said, \"While one respects the filmmaker's small-is-beautiful philosophy, this story may indeed be too small for its britches.&nbsp;... Beresford's nice little movie seems so afraid to make a false move that it runs the danger of not moving at all.\"<ref name=\"Ansen\"/> Linda Beath of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said Duvall's performance was \"fabulous,\" but that the film was \"very slight\" compared to Beresford's Australian pictures.<ref name=\"Beath\"/> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' panned the film, criticizing its mood and tempo and describing Buckley as its only true asset: \"''Tender Mercies'' fails because of an apparent dimness of perception that frequently overcomes dramatists: they don't always know when they've got ahold of the wrong end of the story they want to tell.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Arnold|first=Gary|title=Miserable \"Miracles\"; Duvall: Movin' Slow On the Lone Prairie|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1983-04-29|page=B1, Style (section)}}</ref>\n\nMany critics specifically praised Duvall's performance.

He praised what he called one of Duvall's most understated performances, as well as Foote's minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford's direction.
