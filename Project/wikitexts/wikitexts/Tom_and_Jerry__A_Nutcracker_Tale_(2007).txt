The film was produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]], and is the first ''Tom and Jerry'' film directed by [[Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone]]. It serves as the fifth direct-to-video ''Tom and Jerry'' film and is a semi-adaptation of 1816 short story \"[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]\" by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], with Jerry in the role of the [[Nutcracker doll|Nutcracker]] and Tom in the role of one of the Mouse King's (who is reimagined as a cat) henchmen.\n\nAside from being the last ''Tom and Jerry'' film to be filmed in a 1:33:1 Full-Screen format, ''A Nutcracker Tale'' was the last animated production that [[Joseph Barbera]] worked on before his death on December 18, 2006, and as such, the film is dedicated to his memory. This was also the last animated direct-to-video film released under the [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label before [[Warner Bros.]] ceased using the brand's name altogether in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nOn August 13, 2020, it was announced that the film would be released on [[Blu-ray]] and special edition [[DVD]], and paired with ''[[Tom and Jerry: Santa's Little Helpers]]''. The bundle released on October 27, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/home-entertainment/special-blu-ray-edition-of-tom-and-jerry-nutcracker-tale-set-for-october/|title=Special Blu-Ray Edition of 'Tom and Jerry: Nutcracker Tale' Set for October|date=13 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter watching ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] and his ward [[Tuffy (Tom and Jerry)|Tuffy]] find themselves pulled into the story. The stage transforms into a wintry wonderland where the toys all enjoy a dinner feast. Tom and the other cats ruin the feast and trap the toys while Jerry, Paulie and Nelly try to stop them. Tom traps a Ballerina toy in a cage and brings her to the Cat King, who unsuccessfully asks her to dance for him. Tuffy, Jerry, and their new friends Paulie the pixie and Nelly the toy pony decide to follow a star to meet the Toy Maker. Tom chases them through several magical realms. Nelly is captured by the cats and she tells them where the others are headed. The remaining three make it to the Toy Maker and he fixes Paulie, who suffered damage during the journey. The Toy Maker gives them a key that allows them to awaken an army of toy soldiers. The three depart with their new army to take back the kingdom. When the cats attempt to escape the army of toy soldiers, the Ballerina appears with the other toys and leads them in an army against the Cat King.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Spike Brandt]] (uncredited) and [[William Hanna]] (archive sound, uncredited) as [[Tom Cat]] and [[Jerry Mouse]]\n* [[Tony Cervone]] as Butch Cat\n* [[Chantal Strand]] as Tuffy\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] as Paulie\n* [[Kathleen Barr]] as Nelly\n* [[Tara Strong]] as La Petite Ballerina\n* [[Garry Chalk]] as King of the Cats\n* [[Trevor Devall]] as Lackey\n* [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] as The Toymaker\n* Mark Oliver as Dr. Malevolent\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Brandt, [[Joseph Barbera]] decided on a Nutcracker adaptation as he thought its music fit perfectly with ''Tom and Jerry''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|date=October 2, 2007|title=''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'' Dances Onto DVD Tuesday, October 2|url=https://enewsi.com/news.php?catid=194&itemid=11922|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100142/http://enewsi.com/news.php?catid=194&itemid=11922|archive-date=October 13, 2007|access-date=June 10, 2020|website=Entertainment News International}}</ref> The [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] page for the [[DVD]] appeared sometime in August 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 26, 2007|title=''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'' DVD News!|url=http://www.amazon.com/Tom-Jerry-Nutcracker-Tale/dp/B000S6LP50|access-date=June 10, 2020|website=Anime Superhero}}</ref>{{when|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Widescreen ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}\n''Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale'' was the fourth ''Tom and Jerry'' film to be filmed in [[high-definition video|high-definition]] [[widescreen]] (the first three being ''[[Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers]]''), although the Region 1 DVD and the U.S. version of [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] were in [[full screen (cinema)|full screen]] (cropping the left and right of the image).

Avoid this one and rent or buy a holiday classic like the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|animated Grinch]].\"<ref name=\"Nick Lyons\"/>\n\nRenee Schonfeld of [[Common Sense Media]] rated the film 4 out of 5 stars (making it the highest rated ''Tom and Jerry'' film on the site) saying \"especially at holiday time, for kids who understand cartoon action, it's a delightful entertainment.
