Based on [[Captains Courageous|the 1897 novel of the same name]] by [[Rudyard Kipling]], the film had its [[world premiere]] at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]]. It was produced by [[Louis D. Lighton]] and directed by [[Victor Fleming]]. Filmed in [[black and white]], ''Captains Courageous'' was advertised by MGM as a coming-of-age classic with exciting action sequences.\n\nBackgrounds and exteriors for the film, which updated the story's setting to the mid-1920s, were shot on location in [[Port aux Basques, Newfoundland]] and [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]] in Canada, and [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/3994?sid=31d9fc56-7d89-4cba-986c-30bf6692197a&sr=7.608802&cp=1&pos=0|title = AFI&#124;Catalog}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHarvey Cheyne ([[Freddie Bartholomew]]) is the spoiled son of American business tycoon Frank Burton Cheyne ([[Melvyn Douglas]]). Harvey is shunned by his classmates at a private boarding school, and eventually suspended for bad behavior. His father therefore takes him on a business trip to Europe, travelling there by trans-Atlantic steamship. Mid-passage, Harvey falls overboard in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]. He is rescued by a Portuguese-American fisherman, Manuel Fidello ([[Spencer Tracy]]), and taken aboard the fishing [[schooner]] \"''We're Here\"'', from Gloucester, Massachusetts.\n\nHarvey is shocked the schooner's captain, Disko Troop ([[Lionel Barrymore]]), intends fishing in the Atlantic for three more months. He fails to persuade the captain to take him back to New York nor can he convince him of his wealth; but Captain Troop offers Harvey temporary crew membership until they return to port. Harvey is reluctant to do real work but eventually accepts. Befriended by Captain Troop's son, Dan ([[Mickey Rooney]]), he becomes acclimated to the demanding fishing lifestyle. The ''We're Here'' fills with fish they catch. When a prank of Harvey's causes a fish hook to lodge in a crewman's arm (\"Long Jack\", played by [[John Carradine]]), Manuel defends the boy.\n\nIn the climactic race back to the [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]] port against a rival schooner, the ''Jennie Cushman'', Manuel climbs to the top of the mast to furl the sail. However, the mast cracks and he is plunged into the icy sea, tangled in the rigging that will cut him in half. Manuel speaks to the cook in Portuguese and the cook tells the Captain: All the bottom half of him is gone, and he doesn't want the boy to see. He tells the captain to cut him free from the boat, knowing this will kill him. Harvey crawls out on the wreckage, crying and distraught, while the captain strikes blow after blow after blow with the ax until the rigging finally parts. Manuel kisses the cross around his neck and sinks below the water. The schooner returns to port and Harvey is reunited with his father, who is impressed by his son's maturity. Harvey grieves for Manuel, pushing his father away and wanting to stay on the ''We're Here,'' but Disko reassures Cheyne, telling him that there is room in Harvey's heart for both men and that once there he \u201cwill find Manuel mighty satisfactory company.\u201d At the church, Harvey lights two candles, one from Manuel to his father and one from him to Manuel. His father overhears Harvey praying that someday he will be with Manuel again and follows the boy to Manuel's dory, floating near the ship. Harvey is inconsolable and begs Cheyne to leave him alone.\n\nThe next day, in front of the [[Gloucester Fisherman's Memorial|Fisherman's Memorial]], he and his father join the Gloucester community in casting bouquets and wreaths on the outgoing tide in tribute to the men and boys lost during this fishing season. The last shot shows the Cheyne's car, speeding down the road with Manuel's dory on a trailer behind. Through the side window, we see that Harvey is laughing and gesturing, regaling his father with stories of his adventures. Dissolve to a close-up of a smiling Manuel and then to the Fisherman's Memorial.<ref>The movie and the [[Captains Courageous|book]] have very different endings. Harvey's mother rewards Manuel, who does not die, and Harvey's father gives Dan a berth in his clipper fleet.</ref>\n\n[[File:Captains courageous tracy and bartholomew.jpg|thumb|Tracy and Bartholomew as Manuel and Harvey]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Bartholomew]] as Harvey Cheyne\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Manuel Fidello\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Captain Disko Troop\n* [[Melvyn Douglas]] as Frank Burton Cheyne\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as Uncle Salters\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Dan Troop\n* [[John Carradine]] as \"Long Jack\"\n* [[Oscar O'Shea]] as Captain Walt Cushman\n* [[Jack La Rue]] as Priest (credited as Jack LaRue)\n* [[Walter Kingsford]] as Dr. Finley\n* [[Donald Briggs]] as Bob Tyler\n* [[Sam McDaniel]] as \"Doc\" (credited as Sam McDaniels)\n* [[Bill Burrud]] as Charles Jamison (credited as Billy Burrud)\n* [[Gladden James]] as Secretary Cobb (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Sully]] as taxi driver (uncredited)\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as soda steward (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Coleman (actor)|Charles Coleman]] as Burns, the butler (uncredited)\n* [[Lester Dorr]] as corridor steward (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Captains Courageous premiere 1937.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles premiere of ''Captains Courageous'' (May 17, 1937)]]\n[[Frank Nugent|Frank S.
