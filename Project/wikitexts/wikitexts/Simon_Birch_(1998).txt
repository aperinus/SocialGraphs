The main plot centers on 12-year-old Joe Wenteworth and his best friend Simon Birch, who was born with [[dwarfism]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn an autumn morning, an adult Joe Wenteworth visits the grave of his childhood friend Simon Birch and narrates Simon's story as the film transitions to the 1960s.\n\nIn 1952, Simon is the smallest newborn in the history of Gravestown. As a kid, he loves baseball even though he almost never gets to play during [[Little League]], and when he does, it\u2019s only to get a [[Walk (baseball)|walk]] from his small [[strike zone]]. Joe's mother, Rebecca Wenteworth, got pregnant when she was in high school. The only fact anyone knows about Joe's parentage is that Rebecca met his father on a train. Her refusal to reveal the identity of the father has made Joe a subject of rumors and gossip. Simon is obsessed with how long he can hold his breath underwater, always trying to improve this ability.\n\nOne day Rebecca invites drama teacher Ben Goodrich over for dinner. He meets Joe and Simon and brings a stuffed armadillo for Joe. Simon expresses his belief that the niceties of church aren\u2019t necessary. In front of the congregation, he says that if God has made niceties a priority, they are in trouble. Sunday School teacher Leavey belittles Simon, telling him that he doesn't belong in church and his belief that God has a special plan for him is ridiculous.\n\nWhile playing baseball, Simon Birch is given the perfect pitch, and hits it. It soon becomes a [[foul ball]] that hits Rebecca in the head, immediately killing her. Simon gives Joe his most prized possession, his baseball cards, as an apology. Simon and Joe have an argument, with Simon claiming that everything he does is foreordained. Joe disagrees, believing that his mother's death was simply an accident. Joe's grandmother informs him that there must be a plan should she die, as Rebecca never told anyone who Joe's father was, even in confidence. Joe decides his only hope is to find his real father.\n\nJoe and Simon believe that Joe's father may have taken the baseball. They break into the gym teacher's office to find if he has the baseball that killed Rebecca, as that would implicate him as Joe's father. It isn't there, and Joe vandalizes the office, believing that he will never find his real father. The police chief agrees to let them off if they go to the children's retreat over their winter break. Ben picks them up from the police station and takes them for ice cream. Simon informs Ben of his destiny to be a hero, but admits that he doesn't know what that will imply. However, he fears that it could happen at any time, and he could miss it.\n\nA [[Christmas pageant]] with a [[Nativity scene|Nativity]] play is organized by the Sunday School. Marjorie, the school's prettiest girl, is chosen to play the [[Virgin Mary]]; the [[Acrophobia|acrophobic]] Howard is chosen as the angel; Simon is cast as the baby [[Jesus]], as he is the only one who fits in the manger. Despite his reluctance, Simon happily accepts when he realizes that he will be able to stay next to Marjorie for the entire play. Simon helps another child tame his fear and mentions that children listen to him because of how he looks. However, the play proves disastrous as the turtle doves look like winged mutant turtles, the wise men cannot remember the words to \"We Three Kings\", and Howard's acrophobia causes him to forget his lines. It soon escalates to chaos when Simon, incited by seeing Marjorie's cleavage, [[Groping|makes a move on her]]. When Joe attempts to rescue Marjorie and stop Simon, she hits him, while Howard vomits on the stage.\n\nAs a result of the pageant chaos, Simon is not allowed on the retreat and his baseball cards are taken away. However, he breaks into the reverend's office to get them back, inadvertently finding the fateful baseball implicating the man as Joe's father. Simon has Ben drive him to the retreat to inform Joe. At the retreat, Reverend Russell admits to Joe he is his father, just as Simon arrives with the baseball.\n\nWhile Simon and Joe are riding the bus home, it crashes into a lake. When the bus driver abandons the children and the reverend is knocked unconscious, Simon takes command to get everyone out safely. With the help of Joe, Simon is successful evacuating almost everyone, but he nearly drowns saving the last child. Joe wakes up in the hospital and visits Simon, who is dying. Simon mentions that the children listened to him because of how he looks, that the window he escaped through was \"just his size\" and that he held his breath for \"200 Mississippi\", then dies. Joe remarks that he will always remember Simon for the hero that he was.\n\nJoe's grandmother dies that summer, and he is adopted by Ben Goodrich just before his 13th birthday. The film then transitions back to the present day with adult Joe at Simon Birch's grave. Joe's son, who is named after Simon Birch, reminds him he has a soccer game, and they drive away.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ian Michael Smith]] as Simon Birch\n* [[Joseph Mazzello]] as Joe Wenteworth, Simon's best friend\n** [[Jim Carrey]] as Adult Joe Wenteworth / Narrator\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Rebecca Wenteworth, Joe's mother\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Ben Goodrich, Joe's adoptive father\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Reverend Russell\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Grandmother Wenteworth, Joe's grandmother\n* [[Beatrice Winde]] as Hilde Grove\n* [[Jan Hooks]] as Miss Agnes Leavey\n* Cecilley Carroll as Marjorie\n* Sumela-Rose Keramidopulos as Ann\n* Sam Morton as Stuart\n* John Mazzello as Simon Wenteworth, Joe's son\n* Holly Dennison as Mrs. Birch, Simon's mother\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Mr. Birch, Simon's father\n* Thomas J.
