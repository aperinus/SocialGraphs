It was  however considered a hit regardless, due to its immediate TNT premiere ratings success, and subsequent home video sales. A [[prequel]] entitled ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' was released in 2003, also directed by Maxwell and featuring many returning cast members.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a narrated map showing the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]], commanded by [[Robert E. Lee]], crossing the [[Potomac River]] to invade the North in June 1863, marching across [[Maryland]] and into [[Pennsylvania]]. On June 30, Confederate spy [[Henry Thomas Harrison]] reports to Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], commander of the [[First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|First Corps]], that the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]] is moving in their direction, and that Union commander [[Joseph Hooker]] has been replaced by [[George Meade]]. Longstreet reports the information to General Lee, who is concerned that the army is moving \"on the word of an actor\", as opposed to that of his cavalry chief, [[J. E. B. Stuart]]. Nonetheless, Lee orders the army to concentrate near the town of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]]. At the Union encampments near [[Union Mills, Maryland]], Col. [[Joshua Chamberlain|Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]] of the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|20th Maine]] is ordered to take in 120 men from the disbanded [[2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment|2nd Maine]] who had resigned in protest, with permission to shoot any man who refuses to fight. Chamberlain speaks to the men, and is able to persuade all but six to take up arms.\n\nIn Gettysburg, Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]] and his cavalry division spot elements of [[Henry Heth]]'s division of [[A. P. Hill]]'s [[Third Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Third Corps]] approaching the town and recognizes that the main body of the Confederate army is approaching.  Buford recognizes that, with precedent from [[Battle of Fredericksburg|previous battles]], the Confederates will arrive at Gettysburg first and entrench in strong positions, forcing the Union to charge them and suffer heavy casualties.  To prevent this, he opts to stand and fight where he is, judging the terrain to be \"lovely ground\" for slowing the Confederate advance. Buford sends word to [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] commander Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]] to bring up reinforcements. Heth's troops engage Buford's cavalry [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|the following morning]], July 1, with [[Richard S. Ewell]]'s [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]] moving in to flank them. Reynolds brings his corps forward, but is killed by a Confederate sharpshooter. The Union army is pushed out of Gettysburg to [[Cemetery Ridge]], and Lee\u2014rejecting Longstreet's suggestion to redeploy south of Gettysburg and go on the defensive\u2014orders Ewell to take the Union position \"if practicable\". However, Ewell hesitates and does not engage. The armies concentrate at their chosen positions for the remainder of the first day. At Confederate headquarters at [[Seminary Ridge]], Maj. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]] angrily denounces Ewell's inaction to Lee, and requests another assignment.\n\nOn the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day|second day]], July 2, Col. [[Strong Vincent]]'s brigade from the Union [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]] is deployed to [[Little Round Top]], and Vincent places the 20th Maine at the end of the line, warning Chamberlain that he and his regiment are the flank, and that if they retreat, the Confederate army can swing around behind them and rout the Union forces. Lee orders Longstreet to deploy his two available divisions to take Little Round Top and the neighboring [[Big Round Top]]. As Longstreet's corps deploys, Maj. Gen. [[John Bell Hood]], commanding one of the divisions, protests to Longstreet; with the Union holding the high ground, he would lose half his forces if he attacked as ordered. Longstreet, despite his own protests to Lee, orders Hood to attack; Hood is later wounded fighting at [[Devil's Den]]. At the summit of Little Round Top, Chamberlain and the 20th Maine fight off wave after wave of advancing Confederates, and begin running out of ammunition. Colonel Vincent is mortally wounded, and none of the other three regiments in his brigade are able to provide support. Chamberlain orders his men to fix bayonets, and charge in a right wheel down the slope against the attacking Confederates, which Chamberlain describes as \"we'll swing it down; we swing like a door.\" The attack successfully drives the Confederate assault back, and the Union flank holds. That evening, Stuart finally arrives, and Lee reprimands him for his being out of contact. At the same time, Longstreet's remaining division, under Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]], arrives on the field.\n\nFor the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day|third day]], July 3, Lee decides to send three divisions\u2014Pickett's, Trimble's, and [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]]'s\u2014to attack the center of the Union line at Cemetery Ridge. Longstreet expresses his belief to Lee that the attack will fail, as the movement is a mile over open ground, and that the Union [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] under Maj. Gen. [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] is deployed behind a stone wall, just as Longstreet's men had been at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]. Lee nonetheless orders the attack to proceed. Longstreet then meets with the three division commanders and details the plan, beginning first with Colonel [[Edward Porter Alexander]]'s artillery clearing the Union guns off the ridge, before deploying the men forward. Despite heavy Confederate fire, Alexander is unable to make an impact upon the Union guns. When Pickett asks to move forward, Longstreet simply nods. The Confederate divisions march across the open field, and Hancock is wounded as he commands from the front line. One of Pickett's brigades, commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Lewis Armistead]], makes it over the stone wall, but Armistead is wounded and captured by Union troops. The Confederates retreat due to high casualties. Seeing a despondent General Pickett, General Lee implores him to \"See to his division\" to which Picket replies \"General Lee, I have no division\": [[Pickett's Charge]] ultimately fails. Meeting with Longstreet that evening, Lee finally decides that they will withdraw. The film ends with the fates of the major figures of the battle.\n\n==Cast==\n===Confederate===\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Lieutenant General [[James Longstreet]]\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as General [[Robert E.

In 1981, [[Ronald F. Maxwell]] acquired the rights to the property and hired Michael Sharaa to write a screenplay adaptation. Although Sharaa died in 1988, Maxwell completed the 400-page screenplay. [[PolyGram Pictures]] agreed to produce the project as a film starring [[Robert Duvall]] and [[William Hurt]] but went bankrupt shortly afterwards. Maxwell was unable to sell the project to any other studio because of the failures of recent historical epics such as ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' and ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]''. [[Kevin Costner]] was interested in adapting the film but chose instead to direct ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Gettysburg|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59535-GETTYSBURG?sid=c1e4972d-0f89-4cf0-9be7-8cfa6aee4478&sr=6.388564&cp=2&pos=4|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-02|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Maxwell was displeased with American Civil War television series such as ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'' and ''[[The Blue and the Gray (miniseries)|The Blue and the Gray]]'', he reluctantly decided to try to release the project as a television series. The producers originally pitched the project to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1991, as a TV [[miniseries]]. ABC initially agreed to back the project, but when a miniseries about [[George Armstrong Custer]], ''[[Son of the Morning Star (film)|Son of the Morning Star]]'' (1991), got low ratings and after the [[Gulf War]] started, ABC pulled out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19930606&id=iDcdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zKUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3763,1379236|title=The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search|access-date=2015-12-11|archive-date=2015-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222170853/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19930606&id=iDcdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zKUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3763,1379236|url-status=live}}</ref> Maxwell, with help from documentarian [[Ken Burns]], finally secured funding for the film from Ted Turner at the [[3rd Golden Laurel Awards]] in 1991. Originally it was planned as a miniseries for [[Turner Network Television]], but it was released as a film instead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuvall decided against starring as Robert E. Lee in order to appear in [[Stalin (1992 film)|''Stalin'']], while [[Albert Finney]] and [[George C. Scott]] declined the role.\n\nFor the first time, the [[National Park Service]] allowed the motion picture industry to recreate and film battle scenes directly on the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]], including scenes of [[Devil's Den]] and [[Little Round Top]]. However, much of the movie was shot at a nearby [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams County]] farm. Thousands of Civil War [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]] from across the country volunteered their time to come to Gettysburg to participate in the massive battle scenes.\n\nThe score was composed by [[Randy Edelman]].\n\nDuring filming of the battle scenes on Little Round Top, Bradley Egen, an extra playing a Union soldier, was unintentionally struck in the head by the butt of a musket and suffered a mild concussion, however Bradley was able to resume light duties the following day.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Randy Edelman]] and issued on Milan Records.\n{{track list\n|headline = ''Gettysburg'' soundtrack\n|title1 = Main Title\n|length1 =  4:36\n|title2 = Men of Honor\n|length2 =  2:57\n|title3 = Battle of Little Round Top\n|length3 =  3:57\n|title4 = Fife and Gun\n|length4 =  3:03\n|title5 = General Lee At Twilight\n|length5 =  1:25\n|title6 = The First Battle\n|length6 =  2:41\n|title7 = Dawn\n|length7 =  1:58\n|title8 = From History to Legend\n|length8 =  2:56\n|title9 = Over the Fence\n|length9 =  4:11\n|title10 = We Are the Flank\n|length10 =  2:15\n|title11 = Charging Up the Hill\n|length11 =  2:23\n|title12 = Dixie\n|length12 =  2:26\n|title13 = General Lee's Solitude\n|length13 =  3:41\n|title14 = Battle At Devils Den\n|length14 =  1:46\n|title15 = Killer Angel\n|length15 =  4:42\n|title16 = March to Mortality (Pickett's Charge)\n|length16 =  3:18\n|title17 = Kathleen Mavourneen\n|length17 =  3:17\n|title18 = Reunion and Finale\n|length18 =  5:45\n|total_length = 57:17\n}}\nTwo more soundtracks, ''More Songs and Music From Gettysburg'' and a ''Deluxe Commemorative Edition'', were released as well.

The film was distributed by [[New Line Cinema]] which Turner had just acquired. Only released to 248 theaters at its widest release and limited to just one or two showings per day because of its length, the film still managed to gross $12,769,960 at the box office. It would go on to become an all-time high seller on the VHS and DVD market, and has become a staple of classroom history lessons.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Its June 1994 broadcast TV premiere, on TNT, garnered over 34 million viewers, a record for cable TV.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nOne of the longest films ever released by a Hollywood studio, ''Gettysburg'' runs 254 minutes (4 hours, 14 minutes) on VHS and DVD.
