The screenplay, written by [[Nora Ephron]], is based on her [[Heartburn (novel)|novel of the same name]], a semi-biographical account of her marriage to [[Carl Bernstein]].\n\nThe song \"[[Coming Around Again (Carly Simon song)|Coming Around Again]]\" was written and performed by [[Carly Simon]], and became one of her biggest hits. The song reached No. 18 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 5 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart, and was soon followed by the [[Coming Around Again (album)|album of the same name]]. The film was released in the United States on July 25, 1986.\n\n==Plot==\nManhattan food writer Rachel Samstat and Washington, D.C. political columnist Mark Forman meet at a mutual friend's wedding. Both have been married before and Mark has a reputation for being a serial womanizer. After a whirlwind courtship, the two marry, despite Rachel's reservations.\n\nThey purchase a dilapidated townhouse and Rachel struggles to adapt to being a wife in Washington's political high society. The ongoing renovations of their house create some stress in Mark and Rachel's marriage, but they are brought closer together when she discovers she is pregnant. Rachel experiences a difficult labor in which the baby's life is briefly threatened, but she gives birth to a healthy baby girl, Annie.\n\nSoon after, Rachel discovers evidence of Mark's extramarital affair with socialite Thelma Rice during her pregnancy with her second child. She leaves him and takes their daughter to New York, where she moves in with her father and gets her job back as a food writer.\n\nAlthough Rachel insists that she has left him for good, she is dismayed when he fails to call her after several days. She inadvertently leads a burglar to a group therapy session she is attending in her therapist's apartment; he robs the group and takes Rachel's wedding ring. Just after, Mark arrives and asks her to come back, insisting he will never see Thelma again.\n\nRachel gives birth to their second child, but struggles to fully forgive Mark. She spreads a nasty rumor about Thelma having an infection (possibly herpes) but is caught out by Mark.\n\nThe New York police return Rachel's wedding ring after they catch the burglar. When she takes it to the jeweler's to get the stone tightened, she discovers that Mark has bought a very expensive necklace, which coincides with Thelma's birthday. Realizing that he has returned to the affair, Rachel sells her wedding ring and leaves with both her children for New York, this time for good.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Rachel Samstat\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Mark Forman\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Julie Siegel\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Richard\n* [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] as Dmitri\n* [[Steven Hill]] as Harry Samstat\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Betty\n* [[Mamie Gummer]] as Annie Forman\n* [[Joanna Gleason]] as Diana\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Della\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Arthur Siegel\n* [[Maureen Stapleton]] as Vera\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Eve\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Subway Thief\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Wedding Speaker\n* [[Karen Akers]] as Thelma Rice\n* [[Jack Gilpin]] as Ellis\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Dr. Appel\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Rachel's niece\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia.

That way, she could have provided the distance and perspective that good comedy needs.\" He felt \"she apparently had too much anger to transform the facts into entertaining fiction.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860725/REVIEWS/607250301/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''Variety'' thought it was \"a beautifully crafted film with flawless performances and many splendid moments, yet the overall effect is a bit disappointing\" and added, \"While the day-to-day details are drawn with a striking clarity, Ephron's script never goes much beyond the mannerisms of middle-class life.

You are still asking when it's over, and by then a flatness, a disappointment, is likely to have settled over the fillips you'd enjoyed,\" noting that \"[t]hough Ephron is a gifted and a witty light essayist, her novel is no more than a variant of a princess fantasy: Rachel, the wife, is blameless; Mark, the husband, is simply a bad egg\u2014an adulterer. And, reading the book, you don't have to take Rachel the bratty narrator very seriously; her self-pity is so thinly masked by humor and unabashed mean-spiritedness that you feel that the author is exploiting her life\u2014trashing it by presenting it as a juicy, fast-action comic strip about a marriage of celebrities.\"<ref>Pauline Kael, \"Pairs\", The Current Cinema, [[The New Yorker]], August 11, 1986, page 77</ref>\n\nLeonard Maltin gave the film three stars out of a possible four, and wrote \"Lightweight, superficial story is supercharged by two charismatic stars, who make it a must see.\"<ref name=\"bookref1\">{{cite book| last=Maltin| first=Leonard|title=2013 Movie Guide| year=2012|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|pages=598|isbn=978-0-451-23774-3}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in 843 theaters in the United States on July 25, 1986, and earned $5,783,079 during its opening weekend, ranking number two at the box office behind ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.
