Written specifically for [[Bruno Schleinstein|Bruno S.]], the film was shot in [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]], and [[North Carolina]]. Most of the lead roles are played by non-actors.\n\n==Plot==\nBruno Stroszek ([[Bruno Schleinstein|Bruno S.]]) is a [[Berlin]] street performer. Released from [[prison]] and warned to stop drinking, he immediately goes to a familiar bar where he meets Eva ([[Eva Mattes]]), a [[prostitute]] down on her luck, and lets her stay with him at the apartment his landlord kept for him. They are then harried and beaten by Eva's former [[pimps]], who insult Bruno, pull his [[accordion]] apart and humiliate him by making him kneel on his [[grand piano]] with bells balanced on his back. Faced with the prospect of further harassment, Bruno and Eva decide to leave [[Germany]] and accompany Bruno's eccentric elderly neighbour Scheitz ([[Clemens Scheitz]]), who was planning to move to [[Wisconsin]] to live with his [[United States|American]] [[nephew]] Clayton.\n\nAfter sightseeing in [[New York City]] they buy a used car and arrive in a winter-bound, barren [[prairie]] near the fictional town of 'Railroad Flats'. There Bruno works as a mechanic with Clayton and his assistant (played by Ely Rodriguez). Eva works as a waitress at a truck stop and Scheitz pursues his interest in [[animal magnetism]]. Eva and Bruno buy a mobile-home which is sited on Clayton's land; with bills mounting, the bank threatens to repossess it. Eva returns to [[prostitution]] to supplement her wages, but it is not enough to meet the payments. She tires of Bruno's worrying and leaves him, accepting a ride with truck drivers bound for [[Vancouver]].\n\nA man from the bank (Scott McKain) visits Bruno, who is now drinking steadily, and has him sign off on the repossession.  The home is auctioned, and he and Scheitz, who is convinced that the world is conspiring against him, set off to confront the \"conspiracy.\" Finding the bank they wish to rob closed, they hold up a barber shop beneath it, make off with 32 dollars and then go shopping in a small store across the street. The police arrive and arrest Scheitz for armed robbery without noticing Bruno.\n\nHolding a large frozen [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] from the store and the shotgun, Bruno returns to the garage where he works, loads the tow truck with beer, and drives along a highway into the mountains.\n\nUpon entering the small town of [[Cherokee, North Carolina]], the truck breaks down and Bruno pulls over to a restaurant, where he tells his story to a [[German language|German]]-speaking businessman. He then starts the truck, and leaves it circling in the parking lot with a fire taking hold in the engine compartment. Bruno then goes into a [[Tourist trap|roadside amusement park]] across the street, where he starts a ski-lift and rides on it with his frozen turkey. After Bruno disappears from view a single shot rings out. The police arrive at the scene to find the truck is now fully ablaze. The film ends with a sequence showing a [[chicken]] dancing, a [[duck]] playing a drum and a [[rabbit]] riding a toy fire truck, in coin-operated attractions that Bruno activated on his way to the ski-lift.\n\n==Production==\n''Stroszek'' was conceived during the production of ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'', for which Herzog had originally planned to use [[Bruno Schleinstein]] in the title role. After believing [[Klaus Kinski]] to be more suitable for the part, Herzog specifically wrote the leading role in ''Stroszek'' to compensate Schleinstein for his disappointment over ''Woyzeck''. The film was written in four days and uses a number of biographical details from Schleinstein's life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herzog|first=Werner|title=Herzog on Herzog|year=2003|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=0571207081|page=[https://archive.org/details/herzogonherzog00herz/page/142 142]|url=https://archive.org/details/herzogonherzog00herz|url-access=registration|quote=Woyzeck Werner Herzog Stroszek.|author2=Paul Cronin }}</ref>\n\nParts of the movie were shot in [[Nekoosa, Wisconsin]] and in a truck stop in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rob|title=Director Herzog: 'Dawn' is Americana.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-166981245.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104015959/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-166981245.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 2012|work=[[The Capital Times]]|publisher=The Capital Times Company|access-date=November 3, 2013|date=July 30, 2007}}</ref> Other parts of the film were shot in [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]].
