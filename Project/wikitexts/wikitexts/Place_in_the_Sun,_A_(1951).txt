It tells the story of a working-class young man who is entangled with two women: one who works in his wealthy uncle's factory, and the other a beautiful socialite. Another adaptation of the novel had been filmed once before, as ''[[An American Tragedy (film)|An American Tragedy]]'', in 1931.  All these works were inspired by the real-life [[murder of Grace Brown]] by [[Chester Gillette]] in 1906, which resulted in Gillette's conviction and execution by [[electric chair]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite news|last=York|first=Michelle|date=11 July 2006|title=Century After Murder, American Tragedy Draws Crowd|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/nyregion/11tragedy.html|url-status=live|access-date=12 February 2021}}</ref>\n\n''A Place in the Sun'' was directed by [[George Stevens]] from a screenplay by [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], and stars [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Shelley Winters]]; its supporting actors included [[Anne Revere]] and [[Raymond Burr]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=18 July 1951|title=A Place in the Sun|url=https://archive.org/details/variety183-1951-07/page/n191/mode/1up|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|type=Film review; poor reproduction quality|location=New York, New York|volume=183|issue=6|page=6|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=12 February 2021|via=mediahistory collection at Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=21 July 1951|title=\"A Place in the Sun\" with Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters|url=https://archive.org/details/harrisonsreports00harr/page/n134/mode/1up|magazine=[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]|type=Film review|location=New York, New York|volume=XXXIII|issue=29|page=115|pages=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=12 February 2021|via=Media History Digital Library at Internet Archive}}</ref> Burr's performance impressed TV producer [[Gail Patrick]], and would later lead to her casting him as [[Perry Mason]].\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, winning six [[Academy Awards]] and the first-ever [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]]. In 1991, ''A Place in the Sun'' was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, George Eastman, the poor nephew of rich industrialist Charles Eastman, arrives in town following a chance encounter with his uncle while working as a bellhop in Chicago. Although George is regarded as an outsider by the Eastmans, Charles offers George an entry-level job at his factory. George starts dating fellow factory worker Alice Tripp in defiance of the workplace rules. Alice is a poor and inexperienced girl who is dazzled by George and slow to believe that his Eastman name brings him no advantages.\n\nOver time, George begins a slow move up the corporate ladder and is invited by Charles to a social event, where George meets and falls for socialite Angela Vickers, who is also attracted to him. They fall in love. Just as George enters the intoxicating and care-free lifestyle his new life with Angela brings, Alice announces she is pregnant and, unable to procure an abortion, expects George to marry her. George puts Alice off and continues spending more time with Angela without Alice's knowledge. George is invited to Angela's family lake house over [[Labor Day]] and tells Alice the visit will advance his career. Alice discovers George's lie after seeing a newspaper photograph of George and Angela boating with friends. Alice calls George at the Vickers home and threatens to come there and reveal herself unless he leaves and returns to her. Shaken, George tells his hosts his mother is sick and he must leave.\n\nThe next morning, George and Alice drive to City Hall to get married but it is closed for Labor Day. George is relieved and, remembering Alice cannot swim, begins forming a plan to drown her in the lake by feigning an accident. Alice unsuspectingly agrees to the lake venture. Arriving at the lake, George attempts to cover for the upcoming murder by falsely stranding his car in the woods and renting a rowboat under a false name. While they are out on the lake, Alice talks about her dreams concerning their happy future together with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.\n\nGeorge escapes, swims to shore, behaves suspiciously when he comes across campers on his way back to the car, and eventually drives to the Vickers' lodge. He fails to report the accident. Alice's body is discovered and her death is treated as a homicide as the evidence against George begins to mount. Just as Angela's father approves Angela's marriage to him, George is arrested and charged with Alice's murder. George's furtive actions before and after Alice's death condemn him. His denials are futile, and he is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Near the end, he agrees when the priest suggests that, although he did not kill Alice, he did not act to save her because he was thinking of Angela. The priest then states that, in his heart, it was murder. Angela visits George in prison, saying that she will always love him, and George slowly marches toward his execution.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as George Eastman\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Angela Vickers\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Alice Tripp\n* [[Anne Revere]] as Hannah Eastman\n* [[Keefe Brasselle]] as Earl Eastman\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Bellows, defense attorney\n* [[Raymond Burr]] as Dist.

Breen cautioned against direct references to abortion, specifically the line in the script in which Alice says, \"Doctor, you've got to help me.\" In the finished film, the line became, \"Somebody's got to help me\" and, while abortion is possibly implied, the film does not include any actual mention of it.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=A Place in the Sun (1951)|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4789/A-Place-in-the-Sun/notes.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413222947/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4789/A-Place-in-the-Sun/notes.html|archive-date=13 April 2014|access-date=12 February 2021|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, director Stevens threatened to sue for US$1,000,000 any TV station that inserted any commercial into the running of his film without his specific approval of the ad.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mooring |first1=William H. |title=Legal Test Case Scheduled On TV Editing Of Movies |url=https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=fcat19651112-01.1.29&srpos=1&e=-------en-20--1-byDA.rev-txt-txIN-%22Legal+Test+Case+Scheduled%22------- |access-date=April 11, 2021 |work=The Voice |date=November 12, 1965 |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned an estimated $3.5 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office, and earned critical acclaim in 1951.<ref>'The Top Box Office Hits of 1951', ''Variety'', January 2, 1952</ref><ref>Golden, Herb.

Reappraisals of the film find that much of what was exciting about the film in 1951 is not as potent in the 21st century. Critics cite the soporific pace, the exaggerated melodrama, and the outdated social commentary as qualities present in ''A Place in the Sun'' that are not present in the great films of the era, such as those by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Elia Kazan]], although the performances by Clift, Taylor, and Winters continue to receive praise.<ref>Kehr, Dave.
