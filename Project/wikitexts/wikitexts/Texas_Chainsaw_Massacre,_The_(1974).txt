It stars [[Marilyn Burns]], [[Paul A. Partain]], [[Edwin Neal]], [[Jim Siedow]] and [[Gunnar Hansen]], who respectively portray [[Sally Hardesty]], Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and [[Leatherface]]. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate. Although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer [[Ed Gein]], its plot is largely fictional. It is the first film of the [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]].\n\nHooper produced the film for less than $140,000 (${{inflation|USD|140,000|1974|fmt=c|r=-5}} adjusted for inflation)<ref name=numbers/> and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by Louis Perano of [[Bryanston Distributing Company]]. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|rating]], but the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) rated it [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|R]]. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.\n\n''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' was banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since gained a reputation as one of the [[List of films considered the best#Horror|best and most influential horror films]]. It is credited with originating several elements common in the [[Slasher film|slasher]] genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure, and the killing of victims. It led to [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|a franchise]] that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books and video games.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Sally Hardesty]], her [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] brother Franklin, and their friends, Jerry, Kirk, and Pam visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Nubbins Sawyer (The Hitchhiker)|a hitchhiker]], who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket knife and cuts himself, then takes a single [[Polaroid camera|Polaroid]] picture of Franklin, for which he demands money. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo, and slashes Franklin's left arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refill their vehicle, but [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Drayton Sawyer (The Cook)|the proprietor]] tells them that the pumps are empty.\n\nThey continue toward the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming hole, and the couple go to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house, and Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. [[Leatherface]], a large mute man wearing a mask made from human skin, suddenly appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him.\n\nWith darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window, and she flees to the gas station. The proprietor calms her with offers of help, but then he ties her up, gags her, and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving at the same time as the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally and taunts her.\n\nThe men torment the bound and gagged Sally while Leatherface, now dressed as a woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring down one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs, that of their [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Grandpa Sawyer|Grandpa]]. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer, but he is too weak. In the ensuing struggle, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Leatherface attacks the truck with his chainsaw, and, when the driver stops to help, he knocks Leatherface down with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck as Leatherface maniacally flails his chainsaw in the air in anger and defeat.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Marilyn Burns]] as [[Sally Hardesty]]\n*[[Allen Danziger]] as Jerry\n*[[Paul A.
