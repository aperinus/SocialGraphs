They find their gateway to the outside world through an eccentric young prostitute named Penny. They agree to attend a Halloween party with Penny and pretend to be wearing a \"Siamese Twins\" costume.\n\nThe rest of the movie involves the brothers dealing with Francis's health problems, the changing relationship between the brothers, and Blake's budding relationship with Penny. Ultimately, Francis's health deteriorates too far and the twins have to be separated. Francis is too sick to survive and dies, but Blake survives and must begin a life apart from his twin. Penny visits him and the two start a relationship.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a minor critical and financial success. It has received a 78% \"Fresh\" rating from critics polled by [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/twin_falls_idaho Twin Falls Idaho - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and won awards at the Athens International Film and Video Festival and [[Deauville American Film Festival]]. Its limited American theatrical run earned approximately double its $500,000 budget. It has since been released to DVD.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/twinfallsidaho/index.html Official movie website]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0162830|title=Twin Falls Idaho}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=twin_falls_idaho|title=Twin Falls Idaho}}\n*{{Mojo title|twinfallsidaho}}\n\n{{Michael Polish}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:Fictional conjoined twins]]\n[[Category:Films about twin brothers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Polish]]\n[[Category:1999 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
