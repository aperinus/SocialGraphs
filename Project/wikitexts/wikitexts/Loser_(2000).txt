Starring [[Jason Biggs]], [[Mena Suvari]] and [[Greg Kinnear]], it is about a fish-out-of-water college student (Biggs) who falls for a classmate (Suvari), unaware she is in a relationship with their English professor (Kinnear). The film, Heckerling\u2019s first movie after the 1995 hit ''[[Clueless]]'' and a remake of the 1960 film ''[[The Apartment]]'', was a box office bomb and received negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nPaul Tannek, a small-town, intelligent kid from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], is accepted into [[New York University]] on an academic scholarship. Following the advice of his father, he tries to gain friends by being polite and interested in others. However, Paul\u2019s new roommates\u2014Chris, Adam, and Noah, three rich, spoiled, obnoxious city boys\u2014brand Paul a loser because they resent Paul\u2019s polite behavior, [[working class]] background, and determination for an education. After Paul is thrown out of the dorm when the trio concocts a false story to the housing administration about Paul\u2019s attitude, Paul is forced to take up residence in a veterinary hospital. Banned from throwing parties in the dorm because of an [[alcohol poisoning]] incident, Chris manipulates Paul into letting him, Adam, and Noah use the hospital to throw parties.\n\nPaul meets classmate Dora Diamond and develops an attraction to her, unaware that she is having an affair with their decorated but highly pretentious English professor Edward Alcott. Dora is equally as intelligent as Paul, but doesn't have a scholarship and works shifts as a waitress in a strip club to pay for her tuition until she is unceremoniously fired. To avoid a long daily commute which she can no longer afford, Dora asks Alcott if she can temporarily live with him. Alcott selfishly declines her request for fear of losing his tenure at the university if his relationship with Dora is found out. After Paul and Dora bump into each other one night, Paul invites Dora to an [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] concert when he learns she is a fan. Dora agrees to the date, but first goes to a job interview for a night shift in a convenience store, a position she is ultimately denied because she is a woman. Adam happens to be at the same store buying beer and invites Dora to a party which she accepts, but says she will be there only for a short time so she can meet Paul at the concert. At the party, one of the boys slips a [[Date rape drug|roofie]] into Dora's drink, causing her to pass out. Paul returns home dejected from the concert to a huge mess and an unresponsive Dora and immediately rushes her to the hospital. At the hospital, Paul pretends to be her boyfriend since neither he nor Dora can afford to keep her there overnight. He also learns that Dora listed Alcott as her case of emergency contact which he tells Chris the next morning without thinking. Alcott tells emergency officials he doesn't really know Dora when they contact him.\n\nPaul bonds with Dora as she recovers and they start to develop feelings for one another; he also learns that Dora cannot see past her blind infatuation with Alcott, as she tells Paul that Alcott loves her but does not want a relationship. While Paul continues with his studies, Dora searches for a new job. She pulls Paul out of class and invites him out to celebrate receiving a spot in a medical experiment. They steal a loaf of bread from a bakery, coffee from a dispenser in the park, and sneak into a Broadway show. Paul goes out to grab a pizza and a movie for both of them hoping it may lead to something further between them only to return to find Alcott, who has changed his mind about Dora living with him. Alcott reveals to Dora that Chris, Noah, and Adam are now blackmailing him with the knowledge of their relationship in return for passing grades, and also tells her he believes Paul is in on the scheme. After discovering roofies were involved at the party, Paul steals Noah's supply and replaces them with placebos. Paul then pays a visit to Alcott's office to ask how Dora is doing and is instead given his final exam as a take-home test by Alcott to buy his silence. Paul takes the moral high ground and refuses the test, jeopardizing his scholarship and place in the university.\n\nDora overhears Paul on the phone with his father talking about how much he misses her. Alcott then admits he learned that Paul had nothing to do with the blackmail, but still intends to fail him. Dora then realizes that Paul is the one who really loves her and terminates her affair with Alcott, beginning a relationship with Paul. Afterward, Adam, Noah, and Chris' behavior get the better of them and their lives plummet into failure, while Alcott is found out and sent to prison for having an affair with a different student who is underage, and Paul and Dora remain happy in their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Paul Tannek\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Dora Diamond\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Professor Edward Alcott\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Adam\n* [[Thomas Sadoski|Tom Sadoski]] as Chris\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Noah\n* [[Bobby Slayton]] as Sal\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Mr. Tannek\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Gena\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Professor\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Victor\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Dog-loving girl\n* [[Stuart Cornfeld]] as Foreman\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Photographer\n* [[Catherine Black (actress)|Catherine Black]] as Military jacket girl\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Bar dude\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Office clerk\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Homeless woman\n* [[David Spade]] as Video store clerk\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Himself/[[Emcee]] (in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'')\n* [[Brian Backer]] as Doctor\n* [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] ([[Art Alexakis]], [[Greg Eklund]], and [[Craig Montoya]]) as themselves\n}}\n\n==Music==\nThe music was composed by [[David Kitay]].
