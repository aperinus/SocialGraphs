This film was Greenaway's first collaboration with cinematographer [[Sacha Vierny]], who went on to shoot virtually all of Greenaway's work in the 1980s and 1990s, until Vierny's death. Greenaway referred to Vierny as his \"most important collaborator\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/880127/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Vierny, Sacha (1919-2001) Biography|website=www.screenonline.org.uk}}</ref> The film is a rumination on life, love, bad sex, doubling, man's mistreatment of animals, artifice v. the life force and the inevitability of birth, death and decay.\n\n==Plot==\nTwin zoologists, Oswald and Oliver Deuce ([[Brian Deacon]] and [[Eric Deacon]]), are at work studying the behaviour of animals at a zoo when both their wives are killed in a car accident involving a large swan which crashes through the car windscreen. The woman who was driving the car, Alba Bewick ([[Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol]]), is not killed, but has a leg amputated.\n\nVenus de Milo ([[Frances Barber]]), a prostitute and storyteller who plies her trade at the zoo, attempts to forge a relationship with the twins, ostensibly to help them recover from their loss. Meanwhile, Oswald and Oliver gradually become obsessed with images of growth and decay, watching videos on the origins of life and creating [[time-lapse]] video of decomposing life forms. They begin this latter task with a green apple, bitten into and rotting before their camera lens.\n\nThe twins' descent sees them become romantically involved with Alba, and increasingly attached to one another. Venus de Milo remains involved with them enough to observe their obsessions grow: they take to video-taping the decomposition of prawns, and they take a personal interest in Alba's childhood, going so far as to ask her to show them a field seen in a photograph on her bedside table. They become obsessed with snails, and they take advantage of their contacts at the zoo to create decomposition videos of more and more complex animals, moving gradually up the food chain. Excerpts from Sir [[David Attenborough]]'s TV series ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]'', including his narration, are featured in the film.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/a-zed-two-noughts/ |title=A Zed & Two Noughts Movie Review |date=13 October 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref>\n\nAlba becomes a subject for the experiments of her surgeon, who eventually amputates her other leg, claiming it is putting stress on her spine. His true motive is to fashion Alba into a subject of his recreations of [[Johannes Vermeer]] paintings; Venus de Milo participates in this process, as well.\n\nUltimately, the Deuce brothers' obsession with decay leads them to the top of the food chain, and to a complex life-and-death negotiation with Alba herself. The brothers' project seems the only possible emotional investment for either of them, so Alba offers herself as the final specimen to be photographed in its decay. However her family intervenes before the brothers can claim her, so they are forced to find another way to create their final time-lapse video. They do so by returning to the field of Alba's childhood and setting up the necessary equipment to facilitate and capture their own decomposition. A huge infestation of [[snail]]s covers the equipment and bodies, however, and finally shorts out the electrical system, halting their grand project.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Andrea Ferreol]] as Alba Bewick\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as Oswald Deuce\n* [[Eric Deacon]] as Oliver Deuce\n* [[Frances Barber]] as Venus de Milo\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Van Hoyten\n* [[Jim Davidson]] as Joshua Plate\n* Agnes Brulet as Beta Bewick\n* Guusje Van Tilborgh as Caterina Bolnes\n* [[Gerard Thoolen]] as Van Meegeren\n* [[Ken Campbell]] as Stephen Pipe\n* [[Wolf Kahler]] as Felipe Arc-en-Ciel\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as Fallast\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally positive reviews, holding a 75% on aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 20 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zed_and_two_noughts/ |title=A Zed and Two Noughts (1990) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref> [[Philip French]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote, \"The energy is immense, the appearance of the film consistently sleek and visually exciting.\" [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] considers it to be \"the boldest and arguably the best of Peter Greenaway's fiction features\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://petergreenaway.org.uk/zoo.htm |title=A Zed & Two Noughts |access-date=27 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408023729/http://petergreenaway.org.uk/zoo.htm |archive-date=8 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=January 2017}} Not all reviews were positive, however.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'Zed' Comes to Naught in Style|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-12/entertainment/ca-20180_1_zed-movie-greenaway|access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"pretentious, humorless and, worst of all, more boring than a retrospective devoted to television weather forecasts delivered over a 30-year period at 11 P.M., Eastern standard time.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM FESTIVAL; 'Zed and Two Naughts'|work=[[The New York Times]]|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE5DD133DF933A1575AC0A960948260|access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Philip Hoffman (filmmaker)|Philip Hoffman]]'s 1986 documentary film ''[[?O, Zoo!: The Making of a Fiction Film]]'' was based in part around the making of ''A Zed & Two Noughts''.<ref>Robert Everett-Green, \"Celluloid experiments\".

The \"Angelfish Decay\"/\"Swan Rot\"/\"L'Escargot\" theme was originally written for ''Childs Play'', a dance work commissioned by [[Lucinda Childs]]. Performance of the soundtrack is credited to Nyman, [[Alexander Balanescu]], Elisabeth Perry, [[Sarah Leonard (singer)|Sarah Leonard]] and \"The Zoo Orchestra\". While the score is in the Michael Nyman Band's repertoire, particularly \"Time Lapse\" and \"Prawn Watching\", they do not perform on the soundtrack.  Musicians credited on the film's closing credits are (in alphabetical order) Arno Bons, Gerard Bouwhuis, Bas Dekker, Pieter Gouderjaan, Rob Hageman, John Helstone, Jan Jansen, Sofia Kiss, Henk Leether, Beverly Lund, Gerrit Oloeman, Jelle Schouten, Jorn Shroeder, Peter Stan, Win Steinman, Leo Van Oostron, Marien Van Staalen, Adri Van Velson, Peter Veenhuizen, Lene Te Voortwis, Frans Vreugdenhil, and Gerbrand Westveen.\n\n===Track listing===\n#\"Angelfish Decay\"\n#\"Car Crash\"\n#\"Time Lapse\"\n#\"Prawn Watching\"\n#\"Bisocosis Populi\"\n#\"Swan Rot\"\n#\"Delft Waltz\"\n#\"Up for Crabs\"\n#\"Vermeer's Wife\"\n#\"Venus de Milo\"\n#\"Lady in the Red Hat\"\n#\"L'Escargot\"\n\n*Produced by [[David Cunningham (musician)|David Cunningham]]\n*Recorded at VARA Studio, [[Berry Street Studio]] and [[Olympic Studios]]\n*Mixed at Olympic Studios\n*Digital editing at Finesplice\n*Mastered by Tim Young and Michael J.
