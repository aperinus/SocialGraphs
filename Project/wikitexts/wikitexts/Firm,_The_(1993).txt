The film is based on the 1991 novel ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' by author [[John Grisham]]. ''The Firm'' was one of two films released in 1993 that were adapted from a Grisham novel, the other being ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.\n\nReleased on June 30, 1993, the film was a major commercial success, grossing $270.2&nbsp;million against a budget of $42&nbsp;million, making it the highest grossing film adapted from a Grisham novel and the highest-grossing R-rated film of 1993, and received positive reviews for the performances (particularly from Cruise and Hunter), although the screenplay received some criticism. Holly Hunter was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance, while [[Dave Grusin]] was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mitch McDeere]], about to graduate near the top of his class from [[Harvard Law School]], accepts a generous job offer from Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a [[boutique law firm]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Mitch and his wife [[Abby McDeere|Abby]] move to Memphis, and he studies to pass the Tennessee [[bar exam]]. Senior partner Avery Tolar mentors Mitch and introduces him to the firm's professional culture, which demands strict loyalty, confidentiality, and a willingness to charge exceptional fees. Mitch is seduced by the money and perks \u2013 including a house, a brand new Mercedes-Benz, and his student loans paid off \u2013 but Abby is suspicious of the firm's interference with employees\u2019 families.\n\nMitch passes the bar exam and begins working long hours, straining his marriage. Working closely with Avery, Mitch learns that most of the firm's work involves helping wealthy clients hide money in off-shore shell corporations and other dubious tax-avoidance schemes. During a working trip to the [[Cayman Islands]], Mitch hears a client state that the firm's Chicago clients break people's legs, and finds suspicious documents in a locked closet at Avery's vacation house relating to four of the firm's associates who died under suspicious circumstances. Meanwhile, a local prostitute seduces Mitch, as prearranged by the firm's security chief, Bill DeVasher, who then uses photos of the tryst to blackmail Mitch into silence about the firm's activities, threatening to send the photos to Mitch's wife Abby. This prompts Mitch to hire a private investigator, Eddie Lomax, to investigate the associates' mysterious death, but soon after starting to work on the case, Lomax is fatally shot in his office by two hit-men, a murder that his secretary Tammy witnesses while hiding under the desk.\n\nMitch is approached by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents who reveal that BL&L's biggest client is the Morolto [[crime family]] of the [[Chicago Outfit]]. Most of the firm is complicit in a massive [[tax fraud]] and [[money laundering]] scheme. The dead associates had learned the truth and were killed on the firm's orders, as was Lomax. The FBI warns Mitch that his house, car, and office are bugged and pressures him to provide evidence against the firm and the Moroltos. Mitch agrees to cooperate in return for $1.5&nbsp;million and the release of his brother Ray, who is serving time in an Arkansas prison. The FBI orders Ray's release, planning to return him to prison once Mitch hands over the incriminating files, and gives him half the money. Mitch confesses his one-night stand in the Caymans to Abby, who prepares to leave him.\n\nWhen a client complains about billing for several hours of extra fees, Mitch realizes that mailing clients these padded bills is [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]], exposing the firm to [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] charges. He secretly copies the firm's billing records with help from Tammy, but needs files from Avery's house in the Caymans. Avery invites Abby to come with him to the Caymans and she declines, but he reveals his Caymans schedule has changed, threatening Mitch's plans. Telling Tammy not to inform Mitch, Abby flies to the Caymans to seduce and drug Avery. The firm's phone tap picks up Abby's warning to Tammy, and DeVasher sends his hitmen to the Caymans. After Abby and Tammy steal, copy, and return the files, a drowsy Avery tells Abby that the firm had arranged for the Caymans prostitute on the beach to seduce Mitch. Avery warns Abby to leave and is later murdered by DeVasher's hitmen, who make it look like he drowned in the bathtub.\n\nMitch's plans are jeopardized when a prison guard on the Moroltos' payroll alerts DeVasher after Ray is transferred to FBI custody without the usual formalities. Fleeing from DeVasher and his hitman, Mitch enters a building where DeVasher inadvertently shoots the hitman dead before Mitch blindsides him and beats him unconscious. Mitch meets with the Moroltos, presenting himself as a loyal attorney looking out for his clients' interests. He claims that his contact with the FBI and his copying of files were an attempt to expose the firm's illegal over-billing, and asks the Moroltos for permission to turn over their billing invoices to help the FBI's case against the firm. Revealing that he has made his own copies, he assures them that as long as he is alive, any information he has about their legal affairs is safe under [[attorney\u2013client privilege]]. Guaranteeing Mitch's safety, the Moroltos reluctantly let him give the FBI the evidence it needs to prosecute the firm. Since the Moroltos were not tied to the mail fraud operations and attorney\u2013client privilege does not apply when a lawyer knows about ongoing criminal activity, Mitch is able to continue his legal career, and reconciles with Abby.\n\nThe FBI is furious that Mitch bailed the Moroltos out, but Mitch reminds them that the evidence he provided falls under RICO's jurisdiction and can all but guarantee every senior member of the firm going to prison for decades. The film ends as the McDeeres return to [[Boston]], driving the same well-used car in which they arrived in Memphis, while Ray, having been given the $750,000 Mitch obtained from the FBI by Tammy, enjoys his new life in the Caymans.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Mitch McDeere]], a promising recent Harvard Law graduate\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as [[Abby McDeere]], Mitch's wife\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Avery Tolar, Mitch's mentor at the Firm\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Tammy Hemphill, Eddie's [[chain-smoking]] secretary and lover who aids Mitch in copying and stealing the files in Memphis and the Cayman Islands\n* [[Ed Harris]] as FBI Agent Wayne Tarrance, the agent in charge of the investigation into the Firm; Mitch's primary contact with the FBI\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Oliver Lambert, senior partner at the Firm\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as Royce McKnight, managing partner at the Firm\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Ray McDeere, Mitch's brother who was in jail for a [[manslaughter]] conviction\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as Lamar Quinn, Mitch's friend who works at the Firm\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Bill DeVasher, officially the head of security at the Firm\u2014unofficially the Firm's main hitman\n* [[Sullivan Walker]] as Thomas Abanks, the owner of a scuba diving business\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Eddie Lomax, a [[private investigator]] and former cell-mate of Ray McDeere\n* [[Barbara Garrick]] as Kay Quinn, Lamar Quinn's wife who befriends both Abby and Mitch\n* [[Steven Hill]] as FBI Director Denton Voyles\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Nina Huff, Mitch's Secretary\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as Tony Morolto\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Joey Morolto\n* [[Jerry Weintraub]] as Sonny Capps\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as The Nordic Man, Morolto Hitman\n* [[Dean Norris]] as The Squat Man, Morolto Hitman\n* [[Karina Lombard]] as A Girl Who Seduces McDeere, later identified as Abbie\n* [[John Beal (actor)|John Beal]] as Nathan Locke\n* [[Paul Calderon]] as Thomas Richie<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/paul-calderon/credits/3000432289/|title=Paul Calderon}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography took place from November 9, 1992 to March 20, 1993 and though it was primarily filmed in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], some scenes were filmed in [[Marion, Arkansas]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].\n\nThe film's soundtrack is almost exclusively solo piano by [[Dave Grusin]].\n\n[[Gene Hackman]]'s name did not appear on the film's release poster. Hackman joined the film late, when it was already well into production, because the producers had originally wanted to change the gender of the character and cast [[Meryl Streep]], until author John Grisham objected and Hackman was eventually cast. [[Tom Cruise]]'s deal with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] already stated that only his name could appear above the title. Hackman also wanted his name to appear above the title, but when this was refused he asked for his name to be removed completely from the poster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-27/entertainment/ca-7504_1_gene-hackman|title=A look at Hollywood and the movies : 'Firm' Billing : Trust Us \u2013 Gene Hackman's in It|first=Jane|last=Galbraith|date=27 June 1993|via=LA Times|access-date=2016-04-28|archive-date=2016-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531165304/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-27/entertainment/ca-7504_1_gene-hackman|url-status=live}}</ref> Hackman's name does appear in the beginning or end credits.\n\nThis is also the final film for [[Steven Hill]] and [[John Beal (actor)|John Beal]].\n\n==Differences from the novel==\n{{Original research|table|date=June 2022}}\nThe film accords with the book in most respects, but the ending is significantly different. Mitch does not end up in the [[Caribbean]], as in the book; he and Abby simply get into their car and drive back to Boston.\n\nA more fundamental difference from the book is the motives and manner in which Mitch solves his predicament. In the book, Mitch acknowledges to himself that he is breaking the attorney\u2013client privilege by copying information and giving it to the FBI. In most US states this privilege only applies to crimes that have already been committed. The privilege does not apply if a lawyer knows that his client either is committing or will commit a crime.  However, it is important to note that the attorney-client privilege is one of an [[evidence (law)|evidentiary]] nature relating specifically to information sought during pretrial discovery or at trial.  This is distinguished from an attorney's [[duty of confidentiality]], which prohibits (with exceptions including, for example, if a client is engaged in conduct that will certainly lead to physical harm against another) disclosure of communications made between the attorney and client.  Additionally, Mitch must disclose information about his legitimate clients as well.  Accepting that he will likely not be allowed to practice law anywhere again, he [[Embezzlement|swindles]] $10&nbsp;million from the firm, along with receiving $1&nbsp;million of a promised $2&nbsp;million from the FBI for his cooperation. After an extended manhunt involving the police, the firm's lawyers, and hired thugs from the Morolto family, Mitch escapes with Abby (and his brother Ray) to the [[Cayman Islands]].  Before fleeing, he leaves behind detailed records of the firm's illegal activities, as well as a recorded [[deposition (law)|deposition]].  Mitch's information gives federal prosecutors enough evidence to indict half of the firm's active lawyers right away, as well as several retired partners.  The documents also provide the FBI with circumstantial evidence of the firm's involvement in money laundering and tax fraud, and thus [[probable cause]] for a search warrant for the firm's building and files.  This additional evidence is enough to smash both the firm and the Morolto family with a massive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] indictment.\n\nIn the film, apparently in order to preserve the protagonist's personal [[integrity]], Mitch exposes a systematic overbilling scheme by the firm, thus driving a wedge between the Moroltos (who in essence become complicit with Mitch) and their law firm (in the book, overbilling only received a brief mention). He receives a smaller amount of money from the FBI, which he gives to Ray, allowing him to disappear.  Rather than capitalizing on his circumstances by stealing money from the firm, as in the book, the movie's McDeere ends up battered and bruised, but with his integrity and professional ethics intact. Mitch also makes the FBI have to work in order to bring down the firm by having to argue that each instance of excessive billing is a federal offense (by virtue of the excessive bills being sent [[United States Postal Service|through the mail]]).  The volume and frequency meet the criteria for RICO, thereby enabling the FBI to effectively put the firm out of business by seizing its property and equipment and freezing its bank accounts. From here the Moroltos would then need to find another law firm willing to take them on as clients, and if they couldn't, charges for non-lodgment of tax returns could be brought.  Since Mitch is exposing only illegal activity, he is able to retain his law license.\n\nAvery Tolar was originally Avery Tolleson; the latest version of the novel uses the film's surname. Tolar is portrayed as a sort of reluctant villain in the film, while in the novel he has no such moral conflicts.\n\nMitch's confession to Abby about his [[sexual infidelity]] was also unique to the film. In the novel, McDeere never tells Abby about his infidelity. In the book, Abby's not knowing about Mitch's infidelity is a major \"suspense\" piece. Mitch comes home one evening and finds an envelope addressed to Abby, that has \"Photos \u2013 Do Not Bend\" written on it. The photos were surreptitiously given to DeVasher by Art Germain. Mitch thinks it is the pictures he was shown of his infidelity overseas. Abby is in the bedroom when he sees the open package. He enters the bedroom and learns that Abby opened the package, but it was empty. Mitch realizes DeVasher is toying with him, and this incident in the book causes Mitch to cooperate with the FBI.  In the film, Mitch's confession prompts Abby to seriously consider leaving him, but she ultimately helps him bring down the firm.\n\nAlso, in the book, Eddie's old secretary, Tammy, seduces and drugs Avery.  In the movie, however, it is Abby who seduces Avery.  This also changes the character development because in the movie Abby is portrayed as risking herself for Mitch. In the book, Abby is simply an accomplice to Tammy.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released while Grisham was at the height of his popularity.
