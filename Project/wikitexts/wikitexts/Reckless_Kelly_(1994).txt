The story is a [[Satire|satirical]] take on a modern-day [[Ned Kelly]], a famous Australian outlaw.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nA modern-day [[Ned Kelly]] robs banks in Australia and gives all the money to the poor people. Ned is forced to go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to make enough money to save his family's land. As it goes against his belief, he cannot simply rob banks there for his own benefit. Ned is forced to find another way to come up with the $1 million required to save his family island.
