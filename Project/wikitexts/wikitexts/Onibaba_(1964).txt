The film is set during a civil war in the fourteenth century. [[Nobuko Otowa]] and [[Jitsuko Yoshimura]] play two women who kill soldiers to steal their possessions, and [[Kei Sat\u014d]] plays the man who ultimately comes between them.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set somewhere in Japan near Kyoto, in the mid-fourteenth century during a period of civil war. Two fleeing soldiers are ambushed in a large field of tall, thick reeds and murdered by an older woman and her young daughter-in-law. The two women loot the dead soldiers, strip them of their armour and weapons, and drop the bodies in a deep pit hidden in the field. The next day, they take the armor and weapons to a merchant named Ushi and trade them for food. The merchant tells them news of the war, which is driving people across the country to desperation. As they leave, Ushi makes a sexual proposition to the older woman, who rebuffs him. A neighbor named Hachi, who has been at war, returns. The two women ask about Kishi, who was both the older woman's son and younger woman's husband, and was [[conscription|drafted]] along with Hachi. Hachi tells them that they deserted the war and that Kishi was later killed when they were caught stealing food from farmers. The older woman warns the younger woman to stay away from Hachi, whom she blames for her son's death.\n\nHachi begins to show interest in the younger woman and, despite being warned to stay away from Hachi, she is seduced by him. She begins to sneak out every night to run to his hut and have sex. The older woman learns of the relationship and is both angry and jealous. She tries to seduce Hachi herself, but is coldly rebuffed. She then pleads with him to not take her daughter-in-law away, since she cannot kill and rob passing soldiers without her help.\n\nOne night, while Hachi and the younger woman are together, a lost [[samurai]] wearing a [[Hannya|Hannya mask]] forces the older woman to guide him out of the field. He claims to wear the mask to protect his incredibly handsome face from harm. She tricks him into plunging to his death in the pit where the women dispose of their victims. She climbs down and steals the samurai's possessions and, with great difficulty, his mask, revealing the samurai's horribly disfigured face.\n\nAt night, as the younger woman goes to see Hachi, the older woman blocks her path, wearing the samurai's robes and oni mask, frightening the girl into running home. During the day, the older woman further convinces the younger woman that the \"demon\" was real, as punishment for her affair with Hachi. The younger woman avoids Hachi during the day, but continues to try and see him at night. During a storm, the older woman again terrifies the younger woman with the mask, but Hachi, tired of being ignored, finds the younger woman and has sex with her in the grass as her mother-in-law watches. The older woman realizes that despite all her warnings, her daughter-in-law wants to be with Hachi. Hachi returns to his hut, where he discovers another deserter stealing his food; the deserter abruptly grabs his spear and stabs Hachi, killing him.\n\nThe older woman discovers that, after getting wet in the rain, the mask is impossible to remove. She reveals her scheme to the younger woman and pleads for her to help take off the mask. The younger woman agrees to remove the mask after the older woman promises not to interfere with her relationship with Hachi. After failing to pull it off, the young woman breaks off the mask with a mallet. Under the mask, the older woman's face is now disfigured, as the samurai's had been. The younger woman, thinking her mother-in-law has turned into a demon, flees; the older woman runs after her, crying out that she is a human being, not a demon. The young woman leaps over the pit, and as the older woman leaps after her, the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\nMost of the cast consisted of members of Shindo's regular group of performers, Nobuko Otowa, Kei Sat\u014d, Taiji Tonoyama, and J\u016bkichi Uno. This was Jitsuko Yoshimura's only appearance in a Shindo film. The two women do not have names even in the script, but are merely described as \"middle-aged woman\" and \"young woman\".<ref name=onibaba-script>{{harvnb|Shindo|1993|p=242}}</ref>\n\n*[[Nobuko Otowa]] as Older Woman\n*[[Jitsuko Yoshimura]] as Younger Woman\n*[[Kei Sat\u014d]] as Hachi\n*[[Taiji Tonoyama]] as Ushi\n*[[J\u016bkichi Uno]] as The Masked Warrior\n\n==Genre classification==\nMany critics have been divided on the genre of the film.

She notes that the han'nya mask \"is used to demonize the sinful emotions of jealousy and its associative emotions\" in Noh plays, and that the differing camera angles at which the mask is filmed in ''Onibaba'' are similar to the way in which a Noh performer uses the angle of the mask to indicate emotions.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|2006|p=116}}</ref> Other reviewers also speculate about Noh influences on the film.<ref>{{cite book|first=Adam|last=Lowenstein|title=Shocking Representation: Historical Trauma, National Cinema, and the Modern Horror Film|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2005|page=101}}: \"Shindo's use of the hannya mask and reliance on heavy drumming punctuated by human cries for Onibaba's score [\u2026] are direct quotations of Noh style.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonenmagazin.de/artikel/Shindo.htm|title=SheDevils - Kaneto Shind\u00f4s Onibaba & Kuroneko\n|publisher=Ikonen magazin|language=de|last=Cuntz|first=Vera| access-date=9 September 2012}}: \"Die Filme [Onibaba and Kuroneku] folgen in ihrer Schauspielkunst, Erz\u00e4hlstruktur und Inhalt den klassischen japanischen N\u00f4-St\u00fccken.\" (\"These Films [Onibaba and Kuroneku] follow classic Japanese Noh Plays in the ways of acting, narrative structure and content.\")</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Lake Inba.JPG|thumb|The film was shot at the Inba Marsh in [[Chiba Prefecture]], Japan]]\n''Onibaba'' was inspired by the [[Shin Buddhism|Shin Buddhist]] parable of {{nihongo||\u5ac1\u304a\u3069\u3057\u306e\u9762|yome-odoshi-no men| bride-scaring mask}} or {{nihongo||\u8089\u4ed8\u304d\u306e\u9762|niku-zuki-no-men|mask with flesh attached}}, in which a mother used a mask to scare her daughter from going to the temple.
