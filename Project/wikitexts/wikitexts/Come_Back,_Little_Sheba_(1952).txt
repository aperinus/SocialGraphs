The script was adapted by [[Ketti Frings]] from the [[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|1950 play of the same title]] by [[William Inge]]. Starring [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Shirley Booth]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], and [[Richard Jaeckel]], the film tells the story of a marriage between a recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and his frumpy wife that is rocked when a young college student rents a room in the couple's house.  The title refers to the wife's little dog that disappeared months before the story begins and that she still openly grieves for. Booth, who had originated her role on Broadway and was making her film debut, won Best Actress honors at the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], and the [[1952 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Circle Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nDoc Delaney is a recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] married to Lola, a frumpy, middle-aged housewife. Doc had once been a promising medical student, but dropped out of college when Lola became pregnant with his child, marrying her because her father had thrown her out of the house. The child later died, and Lola was unable to have any more children. Doc spent the years drinking away the pain, in the process ruining his career and wasting his inheritance. Doc, now sober for one year, is polite but distant toward his wife, while a lonely and unhappy Lola sleeps late, dresses sloppily, and does not keep a tidy house. Every day she goes outside to call for her lost dog Little Sheba, whom she dreams about.\n\nTo make some money, Lola rents a room to Marie, a college student brimming with youthfulness and sexuality. One day Marie brings home Turk, a star on the track team, to model for an ad she is creating for a local athletic competition. Turk is wearing his track outfit which shows off his physique. Lola encourages the couple in their modeling session, but Doc, who walks in to find Turk under-dressed, thinks it borders on pornography. Doc disapproves of a hustler like Turk taking advantage of a virtuous young girl like Marie, but Lola defends him, pointing out that Marie is engaged to another young man, Bruce, who is away but due to return soon.\n\nAs Marie's infatuation with Turk grows, Doc becomes agitated. Lola reminds him that Marie is much like she had been in her younger days, before she became \"old, fat, and sloppy\". Doc calms down, but still voices his disapproval of Marie seeing another boy while Bruce is away. One night, Turk and Marie return from having a few beers, with Turk having every intention of spending the night. Doc sees them together and, deeply upset, goes to the kitchen and looks at his bottle hidden in the cupboard. When Turk tries to force himself on Marie, she asks him to leave. His departure is unseen by Doc, who comes back to see the light go off under Marie's door.\n\nThe next morning Doc takes the whiskey he has not touched for a year from the cabinet and disappears for hours, missing the elaborate dinner Lola has planned for Marie and Bruce. Lola sets the table with the fine china she received from Doc's mother when they married, cleans up the living room, and changes into a fancy dress. Early in the morning, Doc returns in a drunken rage, lashing out at Lola that she is as much a slut as Marie and threatening her with a knife. Lola manages to call two of Doc's [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] friends to take him to the hospital. Doc chases Lola into the kitchen and tries to choke her, then passes out. The two men arrive and take Doc away.\n\nThe next day, a shaken Lola calls her parents asking to stay with them while Doc is gone, but her father still refuses to welcome her back. Marie sends her a telegram saying that she and Bruce have married. A few days later, Doc returns from the hospital, apologizes to Lola for his behavior and begs her never to leave him, vowing to be more attentive to her. Lola promises to stay with him forever; he is all she has. As the two begin to rekindle their marriage, Doc notices how Lola has renovated the kitchen and she tells him how she has found closure in Sheba's death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Doc Delaney\n* [[Shirley Booth]] as Lola Delaney\n* [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] as Marie Buckholder\n* [[Richard Jaeckel]] as Turk Fisher\n* [[Philip Ober]] as Ed Anderson\n* Edwin Max as Elmo Huston\n* [[Lisa Golm]] as Mrs. Coffman\n* Walter Kelley as Bruce\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film is based on the Broadway play ''[[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|Come Back, Little Sheba]]'' by [[William Inge]], produced by the [[Theatre Guild]].<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/50454|title=Come Back, Little Sheba (1953)|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|year=2019|accessdate=November 18, 2020}}</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the rights to the play for $100,000 plus a percentage of the film's profits.<ref name=afi/>\n\nThis was [[Daniel Mann]]'s film directorial debut.{{sfn|Monaco|1991|p=1960}} Producer [[Hal Wallis]] urged him to direct the film since he had directed the play on Broadway.<ref name=dn>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63730624/daily-news/|title=Shirley Booth Triumphs in Her 1st Film|first=Kate|last=Cameron|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 24, 1952|page=341|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}</ref> [[Ketti Frings]] wrote the adaptation.<ref name=afi/> Several scenes which did not appear in the play were added for the film version, notably the [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Burt Lancaster and Shirley Booth in Come Back, Little Sheba (cropped).jpg|250px|right|thumb|Doc ([[Burt Lancaster]]) threatens Lola ([[Shirley Booth]]) with a knife]]\n[[Shirley Booth]], who originated the role of Lola in the Broadway production and won a [[Tony Award]] for her performance, reprised the role in her screen debut.<ref name=afi/> When it appeared that Booth might have other commitments, producer Wallis asked [[Bette Davis]] to take the role, but she declined.<ref name=afi/> Booth told a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine interviewer in 1952 that she had developed the character of Lola from observing several women on the streets of New York City, \"including an unkempt woman she had seen walking aimlessly one night on Sixth Avenue with a dirty white poodle\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tlIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA128 |title=New Queen of the Drama|first=Robert|last=Coughlan|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=December 1, 1952|accessdate=November 18, 2020|pages=128\u2013141}}</ref>\n\n[[Burt Lancaster]] lobbied for the part of the middle-aged Doc though he was only 38 years old at the time.<ref name=afi/> Wallis recalled in his autobiography that \"in order to make the trim and muscular Lancaster appear older, his baggy, shapeless costume was padded at the waist and he was instructed to stoop, hollow his chest and shuffle his feet\".<ref name=afi/> Wallis said in an interview that studio executives were \"[p]repared to accept glamorous men and women in melodramas of the seamy side of life, [but] they were shocked at the thought of making a picture with beaten, unkempt, depressing people\".{{sfn|Tibbetts|2000|p=59}} Film critic [[John C.

However, this review felt Mann's direction was \"uneven\", with the scenes between Doc and Lola coming across as more natural and convincing than those between Marie and Turk.

He explains:\n<blockquote>Their readings treated the film as being about something else, that something else being Inge's picture of broken dreams in middle-class family life in small town America. In this reading they missed Inge's other major point, namely, that when dreams are broken for the middle class, alcoholism is not far behind. \u2026</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The film's negative feminization of Lola (her slovenly appearance, etc.) carries forward the loss of femininity theme in the female alcoholism films examined in the last chapter. She takes on the visual characteristics of a female alcoholic, even though she never drinks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In a sense the movie is about her and her acceptance of her husband's alcoholism. More deeply, it is about her acceptance of her lost child, her lost relationship with her father, and Doc's lost medical degree. Little Sheba represents her past and a past that she will not let go of. It is necessary, then, to read the film, not as a study of an alcoholic personality, but as a study of an alcoholic marriage. The film is about the past and how the past shapes and destroys the present.{{sfn|Denzin|2017|pp=20, 22}}</blockquote>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! Award\n!
