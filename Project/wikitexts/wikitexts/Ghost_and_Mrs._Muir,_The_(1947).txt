It was directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], and is based on a 1945 novel written by [[Josephine Leslie]] under the pseudonym of R.A. Dick. In 1945, [[20th Century Fox]] bought the film rights to the novel, published only in the United Kingdom at that time. It was shot entirely in California (mainly around [[Stillwater Cove]]).\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn Britain in the early 1900s, recently widowed Mrs Lucy Muir moves to the seaside village of [[Whitecliff]] despite the disapproval of her in-laws. She rents a house there named Gull Cottage, although it has a reputation as being haunted by the spirit of a seaman who accidentally died there.\n\nOn the first night after moving in with her young daughter, Anna, and her loyal maid, Martha, Lucy is visited by an apparition of the former owner, a roguish but harmless sea captain named Daniel Gregg. He tells Lucy that his death four years ago was not a suicide, but the result of accidentally kicking the valve on a gas-fired room heater in his sleep. Daniel explains that he wanted to turn Gull Cottage into a home for retired seamen and does not appreciate her presence, having personally frightened away previous visitors. However, due to Lucy's headstrong attitude, as well as her appreciation of the house, Daniel reluctantly agrees to allow her to live in Gull Cottage and he promises to make himself visible only to her.\n\nLucy's poor investment \u2014 her only source of income \u2014 has dried up, and she considers a move back to London. However, Daniel has warmed up to her and asks her to stay. They decide to write a book, a dictation of his memories from his time at sea, for which she will profit. During the course of writing the book, they fall in love. Both realize it is a hopeless situation, and Daniel tells Lucy that she should find a living man to be with. In London, Lucy goes to meet a publisher and becomes attracted to Miles Fairley, a suave author who writes children's stories under the pen name Uncle Neddy. Daniel's lurid and sensational recollections, titled ''Blood and Swash'', become a bestseller, providing Lucy with royalties which she uses to buy Gull Cottage. Fairley follows her back to Whitecliff and they begin a whirlwind courtship after Fairly claims he fell [[Love at first sight|in love with her at first sight]]. Though initially jealous of their relationship, Daniel decides to leave, as he considers himself an obstacle to Lucy's chance at happiness. While she is asleep, he places in her mind the suggestion that she alone wrote the book and his presence was merely a dream. He then fades away after declaring his regret that he never had a life with her.\n\nFairley sends a note cancelling a planned visit to Gull Cottage, saying he will be in London for a few days. Later, Lucy visits London to sign a contract, and obtains Fairley's address in the city from the office clerk to pay a surprise visit. She discovers that Fairley (who is not at home) is already married with two children, and that Fairley has romanced other women in the past. Heartbroken, Lucy returns to Whitecliff to spend the rest of her life as a recluse, with Martha looking after her.\n\nAnna, now at university, returns with a Royal Navy lieutenant she plans to marry. In the course of a conversation with her mother, Anna reveals that she too had seen Daniel, whom she regarded as a childhood friend, and she knew about her mother's relationship with Fairley. Lucy in turn reveals that Fairley is now an overweight alcoholic, abandoned by his wife and children. Through the conversation, Lucy realizes that the ghost she loved was in fact real.\n\nMany years later, now ailing and under a doctor's care, Lucy receives a letter from Anna, informing her that Anna's daughter - also named Lucy - is engaged to a plane captain. Anna believes that affection for captains runs in their family. Lucy rejects the glass of hot milk Martha has brought for her with a complaint that she is tired. After Martha leaves the room, Lucy takes a sip, but the glass falls to the floor as she dies. Suddenly, Daniel returns and approaches her, whispering that she will never be tired again. Taking his hands, her young spirit leaves her aged body and greets him with a loving smile. Unnoticed by Martha, the couple leave the house and walk arm-in-arm into an ethereal mist.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gene Tierney]] as Lucy Muir\n* [[Rex Harrison]] as Captain Daniel Gregg\n* [[George Sanders]] as Miles Fairley\n* [[Edna Best]] as Martha Huggins\n* [[Vanessa Brown]] as Anna Muir (as an adult)\n* [[Anna Lee]] as Mrs. Fairley\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Anna Muir (as a child)\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Mr. Coombe\n* [[Isobel Elsom]] as Angelica Muir, Lucy's mother-in-law\n* [[Victoria Horne]] as Eva Muir, Lucy's sister-in-law\n* [[Whitford Kane]] as Mr. Sproule, the publisher (uncredited)<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=25179 |title=The Ghost and Mrs. Muir |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=2015-03-08 |archive-date=2014-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025111411/http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=25179 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Stuart Holmes]] as Man ordered out of train compartment by the Captain (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\nAlthough Joseph Mankiewicz had an excellent reputation as a screenwriter, Philip Dunne says Mankiewicz's only contribution to this script was writing a couple of \"excellent lines\" for George Sanders' character.

It had the same premise and main characters as the book and film, but it was a situation comedy, downplaying the romantic fantasy elements and focusing on broad humor. The time and setting were changed, with the action taking place in a contemporary American coastal town (although the ghost was portrayed as being from the Victorian era).
