The film centers on Spanish painter [[Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda]]  and his attempt to paint the eponymous [[Quince|quince tree]]. L\u00f3pez struggles to capture a perfect, fleeting moment of beauty on canvas, and the film meticulously chronicles his work.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins by showing [[Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda]] as a very meticulous painter. He drives in pegs to mark his stance, hangs a weight and uses strings to determine the symmetry and center of his painting. His first attempt starts out peacefully but he soon encounters problems due to the weather and the size of his canvas. As L\u00f3pez and a friend discuss [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgement]]'', painted when Michelangelo was in his 60s, which L\u00f3pez is fast approaching, the film's subject takes shape as the relationship between the artist's work and his own mortality. L\u00f3pez's future attempts are much more rushed and frantic as he struggles to compete with the weather, the fleeting sun and the rotting and weighed down fruit in maintaining his vision.\n\n==Participants==\n*[[Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda]]\n*Mar\u00eda Moreno\n*Enrique Gran\n*Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez\n*Carmen L\u00f3pez\n*Elisa Ruiz\n*Jos\u00e9 Carretero\n*Amalia Aria\n*Lucio Mu\u00f1oz\n*Esperanza Parada\n*Julio L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez\n*Fan Xiao Ming\n*Yan Sheng Dong\n*Janusz Pietrzkiak\n*Marek Domagala\n\n==Reception==\n[[Janet Maslin]] wrote that \"the purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=Dream of Light (1992) Review/Film Festival; Watching A Painting Come Slowly Into Being |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7DA143DF932A35753C1A964958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes |work=New York Times |date=October 1, 1992 |access-date=December 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nAt the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]] the film won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI Prize]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/19/year/1992.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dream of Light |access-date=2009-08-14|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0105438|Dream of Light}}\n* {{Amg movie|186770|Dream of Light}}\n\n{{V\u00edctor Erice}}\n{{Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dream Of Light}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Spanish documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by V\u00edctor Erice]]\n[[Category:1992 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about painters]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-Spain-film-stub}}\n{{arts-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
