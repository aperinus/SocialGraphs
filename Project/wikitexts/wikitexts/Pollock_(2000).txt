The film stars [[Ed Harris]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], Robert Knott, [[Bud Cort]], Molly Regan, and [[Sada Thompson]], and was directed by Harris.\n\nMarcia Gay Harden won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for portraying Lee. Ed Harris received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Pollock. The film was a long-term personal project for Harris based on his previous reading of the 1989 biography ''[[Jackson Pollock: An American Saga]]'', written by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1940s, [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painter [[Jackson Pollock]] exhibits paintings in occasional group art shows. \n\nPollock lives with his brother Sande and sister-in-law Arloie at a tiny apartment in [[New York City]]. With Arloie expecting a new baby, Pollock decides to move out on her behalf. Soon afterward, Pollock meets and takes an interest in artist [[Lee Krasner]]. He learns later that his brother has taken a job in [[Connecticut]] building military gliders to avoid the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]]. \n\nPollock, a struggling alcoholic, goes on a drinking binge and is found in a disheveled state by Sande and Lee to which Sande tells Lee that Pollock has been diagnosed as \"clinically [[neurosis|neurotic]].\" Taking pity on Pollock, Lee takes him home and becomes his manager.\n\nOne day, Pollock's old friend Reuben Kadish visits him, bringing along Howard Putzel, who works for wealthy art collector [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. After Guggenheim views his work, he is given a contract to exhibit his paintings, plus a commission to paint a 8&nbsp;ft by 20&nbsp;ft mural in her New York [[townhouse]] entry way. Pollock's first exhibit fails to attract any buyers. After a [[New Year's Eve]] party, a drunken Pollock almost sleeps with Peggy. Afterwards, he falls into another stupor upon hearing that Putzel has died.\n\nPollock and Lee are wed after Lee says they either marry or \"split up\" before moving to [[Long Island]]. During a get-together at Peggy's, Pollock dismisses art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s comments and refuses to change his painting style to be more marketable. Pollock's paintings are not selling but Clement assures him it will change after a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article about him is published and his upcoming exhibit. \n\nPollock and Lee's relationship is strained after he openly flirts with another woman. Meanwhile, to earn more income, Pollock tries various occupations but fails due to his alcoholism. He lies to Sande about his financial status, though this improves after the ''Life'' story about him is published. Later, cinematographer [[Hans Namuth]] films Pollock as he paints, though Namuth's presence interrupts the spontaneous nature of his work. Pollock, who tried abstaining from alcohol, inadvertently ruins [[Thanksgiving]] dinner upon relapsing.\n\n''[[In medias res]]'' to the events of the film, Pollock autographs a copy of the ''Life'' magazine to a fan at an art exhibit in 1950. Five years after the exhibit, Clement tells Pollock that the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' is favoring artist [[Clyfford Still]], saying that his original technique could be the next direction of modern art. \n\nA drunk Pollock reacts badly, becoming angrier when Lee berates him for his drinking and womanizing. By this moment, Pollack's marriage to Lee has become even more strained due to her refusal to conceive children with him, all of which has led Pollock to start an [[extramarital affair]] with teenage abstract artist [[Ruth Kligman]]. \n\nIn 1956, following a conversation with Lee over the phone while she\u2019s in [[Venice]], Pollock tells Ruth \"I owe the woman something.\" On a subsequent visit, Ruth brings along her friend Edith before the three go for a drive. However, an intoxicated Pollock crashes the car; killing himself, Edith, and throwing Ruth into a ditch, seriously injuring her. Closing titles state that Lee never remarried following Pollock's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[Jackson Pollock]]\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as [[Lee Krasner]]\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Dan Miller\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Ruth Kligman]]\n* [[Bud Cort]] as Howard Putzel\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Willem de Kooning]]\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as [[Peggy Guggenheim]]\n* Sally Murphy as Edith Metzger\n* [[Stephanie Seymour]] as [[Helen Frankenthaler]]\n* [[Matthew Sussman]] as [[Reuben Kadish]]\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as [[Clement Greenberg]]\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as [[Hans Namuth]]\n* Everett Quinton as [[James Johnson Sweeney]]\n* [[Annabelle Gurwitch]] as May Rosenberg\n* [[John Rothman]] as [[Harold Rosenberg]]\n* [[Kenny Scharf]] as [[William Baziotes]]\n* [[Sada Thompson]] as Stella Pollock\n* Robert O'Neill as [[Herbert Matter]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted by [[Barbara Turner (actress)|Barbara Turner]] and Susan Emshwiller from the book ''[[Jackson Pollock: An American Saga]]'' by [[Steven Naifeh]] and [[Gregory White Smith]].
