''Chasing Liberty'' was filmed on location in [[Prague]], [[Venice]], [[Berlin]], [[London]], [[Chelmsford]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"imdblocations\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Foster is the daughter of [[POTUS]] James Foster. After [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents ruin a first date, Anna demands less supervision. For his upcoming trip to [[Prague]], the president agrees to assign only two agents to watch over Anna, whose [[Secret Service codename]] is Liberty.\n\nIn Prague, Anna and her friend Gabrielle La Clare attend a concert, where she spots numerous agents in the crowd. Believing her father has broken his promise, she eludes her protectors with Gabrielle's help. Outside the theater, she asks Ben Calder for a ride on his motorbike. Unknown to Anna, Ben is a Secret Service agent, and he informs agents Alan Weiss and Cynthia Morales where she can be found. When the president learns of her behavior, he instructs Ben to guard her without revealing his identity, to give her the illusion of freedom while guaranteeing safety.\n\nBelieving she is finally free, Anna jumps into the [[Vltava River]] naked, mistaking it for the [[Danube]], and she and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] opera being shown in a plaza. The next morning, Anna calls her parents. Initially relieved his daughter is safe, the President's tone changes when he is shown photos of her skinny-dipping. Outraged at her father's tone, Anna decides she will go to the [[Love Parade]] in [[Berlin]]. She and Ben board a train, where they meet Scotty McGruff, a flighty romantic backpacker who gives them a stack of ''[[Six Million Dollar Man]]'' stickers, telling them to post them in random places. One day when they are unhappy, they may come across one and it will make them smile. Ben discovers that they have boarded a [[Venice]]-bound train going in the opposite direction from Berlin.\n\nIn Venice, after checking in with agents Weiss and Morales\u2014who are now growing closer romantically\u2014Ben joins Anna and McGruff and together they explore the city. McGruff disappears with Anna's wallet, she is recognized by tourists and she and Ben flee. With no money, they tell a kind-hearted gondolier, Eugenio, that they recently married against her parents' wishes. During the free gondola ride, Ben kisses Anna to hide her from their pursuers. When he learns the \"newlyweds\" have no place to stay, Eugenio invites them to his house, where they are welcomed by his mother, Maria. That night, thinking their kiss was heartfelt, Anna offers herself to Ben, but he rejects her advances.\n\nThe next day, Eugenio drives them to the Austrian border, as Weiss and Morales show up at Maria's house and are told that Anna and Ben are married, which is then reported to Anna's parents, causing confusion. Upset at Ben's rejection, Anna hitchhikes a ride in a truck, leaving him to chase her through the Austrian countryside. Anna comes to a bridge, where she meets the Jumping Germans, a [[bungee jumping]] group. Ben arrives just as she is being strapped into the harness, and insists on jumping with her.\n\nLater that evening at the Jumping Germans' camp, one of the Germans invites Anna to share his tent for the night. She refuses and flirts with Ben, who rejects her advances again. Upset, she declares that she will share the German's tent after all; Ben finally admits his feelings for Anna and they spend the night together. At the Love Parade, as Ben explains his actions on the phone to his fellow agents, Anna discovers his identity. Enraged at the apparent betrayal, she runs off, only to be harassed by a group of men who recognize her. Ben rescues her, and Anna and her family return to the United States.\n\nWhile preparing for college, Anna tells her mother her heart is \"a little bit broken.\" At college, with Weiss and Morales (who plan to marry) still protecting her, she sees a ''Six Million Dollar Man'' sticker, reminding her of her European adventure. During Christmas break Anna's father tells her Ben resigned from the Secret Service and is working as a photographer in London. During an exchange program to [[Oxford University]] she visits him at the opera, where they kiss, reconcile, and escape on his motorbike.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Anna Foster\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] [[Special Agent]] Ben Calder\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Grant Hillman\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Special Agent Alan Weiss\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Special Agent Cynthia Morales\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as James Foster\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Michelle Foster\n* Tony Jayawardena as White House Guard\n* Sam Ellis as Phil\n* Terence Maynard as Harper\n* Lewis Hancock as [[Press Secretary]]\n* [[Garrick Hagon]] as [[Secretary of State]]\n* Zac Benoir as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]\n* Jan Goodman as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]\n* Robert Ashe as [[Chief of Staff]]\n* [[Beatrice Rosen]] as Gabrielle la Claire\n* [[Martin Hancock]] as Scotty McGruff\n* Joseph Long as Eugenio\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Maria\n* Adrian Bouchet as Gus Gus\n* [[The Roots]] as Themselves<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for Chasing Liberty |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360139/fullcredits#cast |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Story===\nThe storyline was directly inspired by [[Chelsea Clinton]], who was photographed trying to blend in with other students at a [[Stanford University|Stanford]] basketball game.<ref name=\"sfgate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/22/DDGJO4EJ9U1.DTL |last=Nevius |first=CW |title=Just ask Chelsea, Jenna and Barbara |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 22, 2004 |access-date=September 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe problem that Anna Foster (Moore) faces in the film\u2014excessively protective [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents who behave intrusively, like unwanted chaperones, whenever protecting the children of United States Government officials\u2014had previously provided story material for the 1980 comedy ''[[First Family (film)|First Family]],'' which had starred [[Bob Newhart]] as the President of the United States.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nThe story in many ways echoes the 1953 romantic comedy ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]], [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Eddie Albert]].  Hepburn played a princess who slips away from her handlers to be squired around Rome, also on a motor scooter, by Peck, not realizing that he knows her identity and plans a magazine story.  In both films, the leads are accompanied by a goofy friend, in this case played by Albert.\n\n===Filming locations===\nThe exterior scenes of the [[White House]] were in fact filmed at [[Hylands House]] in [[Chelmsford]], [[Essex]], England, because of its resemblance to the White House. [[Blueprint]]s of the White House were also used to create a digital replica, which helped make the exterior scenes look authentic. These blueprints caused the director some trouble when traveling to Washington, D.C., as his suitcase also contained source material about the [[Oval Office]], among other things.

We understand what this freedom means to Anna, partly thanks to Moore's expressive intelligence, but also through director Andy Cadiff's technique.
