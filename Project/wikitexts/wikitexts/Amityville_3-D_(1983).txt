It is the [[Works based on the Amityville haunting|third film based in the ''Amityville Horror'' series]], it was written by [[David Ambrose]], under the [[pseudonym]] William Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/David-Ambrose.html|title=David Ambrose Biography (1943-)|website=www.filmreference.com|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref> It was one of a spate of [[3-D film]]s released in the early 1980s, and was the only [[Orion Pictures]] film filmed in the format.\n\nDue to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and [[Dino De Laurentiis]] over the storyline which did not involve the Lutz family, ''Amityville 3-D'' was not initially promoted as a sequel, and the name Lutz is never used in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.horror.com/php/article-765-1.html|title=Exclusive Interview with George Lutz and Dan Farrands - Part One {{!}} Horror.com|last=Stacilayne|date=April 9, 2005|website=www.horror.com|access-date=March 26, 2019|archive-date=May 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516075707/http://www.horror.com/php/article-765-1.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> However the film does make a reference to the original ''Amityville Horror'' story. The character of John Baxter (Roberts) is loosely based on [[Stephen Kaplan (paranormal investigator)|Stephen Kaplan]] who at the time was trying to prove the Lutzes' story was a hoax. It was panned upon release.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter he exposes a pair of con artists with his partner Melanie in the infamous [[112 Ocean Avenue]] house in Amityville, journalist John Baxter is persuaded to purchase the house by real estate agent Clifford Sanders. While preparing the house for John, Clifford investigates footsteps in the attic. He is locked in the room, where a swarm of flies attack and kill him. John believes Clifford died of a stroke, even after Melanie shows him some photos she took of the real estate agent before his death, depicting him as a rotting corpse.\n\nWhile John is at work, he nearly dies in a malfunctioning elevator. Simultaneously, Melanie experiences bizarre occurrences in John's house. She is found later that night by John, cowering and hysterical against the wall. Her attempts to convince John that something is inside the house fall on deaf ears. Later, while looking over blowups of the photos of Clifford, Melanie discovers a demonic-looking face in the pictures. When she attempts to show the photos to John, she is killed in a horrific car accident. Melanie's death is ruled accidental by everyone, including John, who remains oblivious to the evil in his home.\n\nWhile John is away one day, his daughter, Susan, her friend Lisa, and two boyfriends use a [[Ouija|Ouija board]] in the attic. The game tells them that Susan is in danger. Growing bored, Susan and the others go out in John's motorboat where she falls into the water and drowns. John's estranged wife Nancy, who had come over looking for Susan, is surprised to see a drenched Susan silently walk up the stairs. Outside John arrives home to find Susan's friends bringing her lifeless body to shore. Nancy has a nervous breakdown and believing Susan is still alive and will return shortly, refuses to leave, even for Susan's funeral.\n\nAfter having nightmares about the old well in the basement and unable to deal with Nancy's delusions that Susan is still alive, John allows his friend, paranormal investigator Doctor Elliot West, and a team of paranormal investigators to set up in the house, to help prove if Nancy actually saw something or not. As Elliot and John watch, Nancy is confronted by a spectral being speaking in Susan's voice. Nancy follows the spectre into the basement, where the old well has filled with liquid. Elliot urges whatever is in the well to reveal itself and restore Susan to life. Instead, a demon leaps from the well, burns Elliot's face with fiery breath and drags him to Hell. The house begins to implode. Much of Elliot's team is killed by flying and exploding objects, but John, Nancy, and several others escape through a window. As John and Nancy leave, the well bubbles ominously as an eerily glowing fly emerges from it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as John Baxter\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Nancy Baxter\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Dr. Elliot West\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Melanie\n* [[Lori Loughlin]] as Susan Baxter\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Lisa\n* [[Neill Barry]] as Jeff\n* [[Josefina Ech\u00e1nove]] as Dolores\n* [[John Beal (actor)|John Beal]] as Harold Caswell\n* [[Leora Dana]] as Emma Caswell\n* [[John Harkins (actor)|John Harkins]] as Clifford Sanders\n* Peter Kowanko as Roger\n* Carlos Romero as David Cohler\n\n==Production==\nAn international co-production between The United States and Mexico, like the previous installment. Exterior scenes for Amityville 3-D were shot at the same house in Toms River, New Jersey where the first two films where filmed, which closely resembled the infamous house at Amityville, New York. A house nearby was employed for the exterior of Nancy's house. Interiors were filmed at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico.\n\n==Critical response==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\n''Amityville 3D'' was received negatively by critics and, in many cases, was selected as one of the worst films of 1983. Currently it maintains a 14% rating on ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' based on 21 reviews from critics. The website's critical consensus says; \"A gimmicky ''Amityville'' retread with insufferable characters.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/amityville_the_demon/|title=Amityville 3-D|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date=August 2, 2022}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported \u201cA new cast of characters and the addition of 3-D does little to pump new life, supernatural or otherwise, into this tired genre.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/amityville-3-d-1200425598/|title=Review: 'Amityville 3-D'|date=December 31, 1982|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Once the first two films in a series have exhausted most opportunities for action, the third is liable to average half a dozen exposition scenes for every eventful episode.\"  Of the 3D, she said \"3-D exposition is the stuff of which headaches are made; the footage tends to be so dark that you can barely tell whether it's night or day.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE1D81138F933A15752C1A965948260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|title=Amityville 3 D (1983)|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=November 20, 1983|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nWhile released theatrically in 3-D, the only 3-D home release of the film has been on DVD in the UK and as of August 2012, also in Scandinavia. In October 2013, [[Scream Factory]] released a 3-D Blu-ray of ''Amityville 3-D'', along with ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' and ''[[Amityville II: The Possession]]''.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-amityville-horror-trilogy-scream-factory-blu-ray-review/ \u201cTHE AMITYVILLE HORROR TRILOGY\u201d (Scream Factory Blu-ray Review)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005164453/http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-amityville-horror-trilogy-scream-factory-blu-ray-review/ |date=October 5, 2013 }}.

However they received many complaints as the film was not actually in 3-D and some even mistakenly mistook the release as a 3-D version of the original 1979 film ''The Amityville Horror''.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} Due to this they re-released the DVD with the foreign territory title ''Amityville III: The Demon'' on the box artwork despite the film itself retaining \"Amityville 3-D\" on the title card.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\n==Box office==\n''Amityville 3-D'' was #1 at the box office its opening weekend, grossing $2,366,472 according to Box Office Mojo. Its final domestic gross was $6,333,135. It was ultimately considered a box office flop and ended up being the last film in the series released theatrically until the remake of ''The Amityville Horror'' in 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0085159}}\n* {{Amg movie|2089}}\n*{{AFI film|id=57846|title=Amityville 3-D}}\n{{The Amityville Horror}}\n{{Richard Fleischer}}\n\n[[Category:1983 3D films]]\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1983 horror films]]\n[[Category:1983 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s ghost films]]\n[[Category:1980s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American 3D films]]\n[[Category:American ghost films]]\n[[Category:American haunted house films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Mexican horror films]]\n[[Category:Mexican ghost films]]\n[[Category:Mexican independent films]]\n[[Category:Mexican sequel films]]\n[[Category:Mexican supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Amityville Horror films]]\n[[Category:Demons in film]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films about divorce]]\n[[Category:Films about grieving]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films about mass murder]]\n[[Category:Films about photojournalists]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Fleischer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Howard Blake]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1983]]\n[[Category:Films set in Long Island]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mexico City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Fiction about hoaxes]]\n[[Category:Native American cemeteries in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Spontaneous human combustion in fiction]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s Mexican films]]"}]}}}}
