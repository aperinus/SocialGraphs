It was broadcast in four ninety-minute parts. This adaptation is widely considered to be the most faithful to the novel, maintaining the setting, time period and covers the full arc of the story.\n\nThe original French language  broadcast was critically acclaimed and is considered one of the best television adaptations, especially in its home country of France. However, the truncated three-hour English version was derided for bad acting and is considered very poor. The producers opted to co-film entire scenes in English, instead of using dubbing. The largely French ensemble struggled to deliver solid performances in English.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |total_width=70 |background=#000000 |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |titleT=Episode |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| RTitle          = Episode 1\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jos\u00e9e Dayan]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Didier Decoin]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2000|9|4}}\n| ShortSummary    = [[Jean Valjean]] is released from prison on parole and finds life unbearable until [[Bishop Myriel|Monseigneur Bienvenu]] covers his theft of silver and gives him two silver candle sticks.
