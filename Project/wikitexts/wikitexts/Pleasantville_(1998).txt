It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Joan Allen]], [[William H. Macy]], [[J. T. Walsh]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]], with [[Don Knotts]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Marley Shelton]] and [[Jane Kaczmarek]] in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small [[Midwest]] town, where residents are seemingly perfect.\n\nThe film was one of J. T. Walsh's final performances and was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh-schoolers David and his sister Jennifer lead very different lives: Jennifer is shallow while David spends most of his time watching ''Pleasantville'', a black-and-white 1950s [[sitcom]] about the idyllic Parker family. One evening while their mother is away, David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control.\n\nA mysterious TV repairman arrives and, impressed by David's knowledge of ''Pleasantville'', gives him a strange remote control before departing. When they use the remote control, David and Jennifer are transported into the black-and-white world of ''Pleasantville'', finding themselves in the Parkers' living room. David tries to reason with the repairman, communicating through the Parkers' television but the repairman declares that the world of ''Pleasantville'' is better than the real world and they should be lucky to live in it.\n\nForced to act as the show's characters, Bud and Mary Sue Parker, David and Jennifer explore the wholesome but peculiar town. Fire does not exist and firefighters merely rescue cats from trees, and the citizens of Pleasantville are unaware that anything exists outside of their town, as all roads circle back with no escape. David tells Jennifer they must stay in character and not disrupt the town. Trying to maintain the show's plot, Jennifer dates a boy from school and tells him about what dating is like for her, a concept unknown to him and everyone else in town.\n\nSlowly, parts of Pleasantville change from black-and-white to color, including flowers and the faces of people who experience new bursts of emotion, and foreign concepts such as books, fire, and rain begin to appear. After Jennifer introduces new ideas to her peers, many of her classmates go to the garden to read, becoming \"colored\" in the process.\n\nDavid introduces Bill Johnson, owner of the [[soda shop|soda fountain]] where Bud works, to colorful modern art via a book from the library, sparking Bill's interest in painting. After learning about caring for herself, Betty starts a fire and becomes colored. Jennifer/Mary Sue becomes colored after developing a newfound interest in literature. Bill and Betty fall in love and she leaves home, bewildering her husband George. Only the town fathers remain unchanged. They are led by the mayor Big Bob, who views the changes as a threat to Pleasantville's values, and resolve to do something about their increasingly independent wives and rebellious children.\n\nAs the townsfolk become more colorful, a ban on \"colored\" people is initiated in public venues. A riot is ignited by Bill's nude painting of Betty on the window of his malt shop. The soda fountain is destroyed, [[book burning|books are burned]] and people who are \"colored\" are harassed in the street, while Betty is harassed by non-colored teenage boys. David/Bud punches one of the boys and scares them away, demonstrating newfound courage that turns him colored. The town fathers forbid people from visiting the library, playing loud music, or using colorful paint.\n\nIn protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural depicting their world, prompting their arrest. Brought to trial in front of the entire town, David and Bill defend their actions and arouse enough anger and indignation in Big Bob that he becomes colored as well and flees. Celebrating their victory, David notices that the television store now sells color televisions, broadcasting new programs and footage of other countries and that the town's roads now lead to other cities.\n\nWith Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to his sister, his new girlfriend, and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world while only an hour went by there. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet and assures her that nothing has to be perfect.\n\nA montage reveals the citizens of Pleasantville enjoying their new lives, including Jennifer/Mary Sue attending college, while Betty, George and Bill contemplate the future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as David / Bud Parker\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Jennifer / Mary Sue Parker\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bill Johnson\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Betty Parker\n* [[William H.
