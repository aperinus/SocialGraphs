Joe: The Rise of Cobra''''' is a 2009 American [[military science fiction]] [[action film]] based on the [[G.I. Joe|toy franchise]] created by [[Hasbro]], with particular inspiration from the [[G.I. Joe (comics)|comic book series]] and toy line ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]''. It is the first installment in the live-action [[G.I. Joe (film series)|''G.I. Joe'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Stephen Sommers]]. ''G.I. Joe'' features an [[ensemble cast]] based on the various characters of the franchise. The story follows two American soldiers, [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]] and [[Rip Cord (G.I. Joe)|Ripcord]], who join the [[G.I. Joe Team]] after being attacked by Military Armaments Research Syndicate ([[M.A.R.S.]]) troops.\n\nAfter leaked drafts of the script were criticized by fans, [[Larry Hama]], writer of the comic, was hired as [[creative consultant]], and rewrites were made. Filming took place in [[Downey, California]], and [[Prague]]'s [[Barrandov Studios]], and six companies handled the visual effects.\n\nThe film made its world premiere at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood, California on August 6, 2009, and was theatrically released worldwide the following day, following an extensive marketing campaign focused on the Mid-American public. ''The Rise of Cobra'' opened at the top of the box office and went on to gross over $302 million worldwide by the end of its run, though critical reception was generally negative. A sequel, titled ''[[G.I. Joe: Retaliation]]'', was released on March 28, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Do not add the pre-titles Destro stuff -->\n\nIn 2019, weapons master [[Destro|James McCullen]] has created a [[nanotech]]-based weapon\u2014nanomites designed to devour metal and other materials, capable of destroying anything from tanks to cities. The [[nanobots]] can only be stopped by activating the kill switch. His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to [[NATO]], and NATO troops led by American soldiers [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]] and [[Rip Cord (G.I. Joe)|Ripcord]] are asked to deliver the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]], whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fianc\u00e9e Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by special ops [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett]], [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]], [[Breaker (G.I. Joe)|Breaker]], and [[Heavy Duty (G.I. Joe)|Heavy Duty]]. They take the warheads to [[The Pit (G.I. Joe)|The Pit]], G.I. Joe's command center in [[Egypt]], and upon arriving, rendezvous with the head of the G.I. Joe Team, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]]. Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.\n\nMcCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor, planning on using the warheads to cause worldwide panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends the ninja [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]] and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from infiltration specialist and master spy [[Zartan]].\n\nAfter a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize in his [[particle accelerator]]; after he reluctantly does this, DeCobray is killed by Storm Shadow. Making their way to [[Paris]], the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the [[Eiffel Tower]] and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in doing so, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the [[Arctic]], while the Joes are to be deported from France; having been framed for destroying the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe Joes, rather than going back to The Pit as ordered, locate the secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads the three remaining warheads onto three missiles, which are aimed for [[Beijing]], [[Moscow]], and [[Washington, DC]], the world's three most important [[Capital city|capitals]]. He states that he intends to do this because by killing millions of people in these cities, he will strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the [[President of the United States]]. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that McCullen's employer the Doctor is actually Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered [[Dr. Mindbender]] in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him and forced him to wear a mask to help him breathe. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke using a flamethrower, McCullen ends up being burned when Duke shoots the weapon and causes it to explode, so Rex and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back after Rex activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.\n\nRex assumes the identity of [[Cobra Commander|the Commander]], having healed McCullen's burned face with nanomites, transforming his skin into a silver-like substance and naming him \"Destro\", which places McCullen under the Commander's control. They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On the [[supercarrier]] [[USS Flagg|USS ''Flagg'']], the Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body. Meanwhile, Zartan, having had his physical appearance altered by nanomites, infiltrates the [[White House]] during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States, thus completing a part of McCullen's plan to rule the world, now as The Commander's contengency and acting leader of a reorganized M.A.R.S., now dubbed [[Cobra (G.I. Joe)|COBRA]].\n\n==Cast==\n\n===G.I. Joe===\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Conrad Hauser / Duke]]:<br/>The lead soldier.
