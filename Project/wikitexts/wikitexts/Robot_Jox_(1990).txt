Co-written by science-fiction author [[Joe Haldeman]], the film's plot follows Achilles, one of the \"robot jox\" who pilot giant machines that fight international battles to settle territorial disputes in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world.\n\nAfter producer [[Charles Band]] approved Gordon's initial concept, the director approached Haldeman to write the script. Gordon and Haldeman clashed frequently over the film's tone and intended audience. [[Principal photography]] finished in Rome in 1987, but the bankruptcy of Band's [[Empire Pictures]] delayed the film's release in theaters until 1990. It earned $1,272,977 in domestic theatrical gross, failing to return its production cost. ''Robot Jox'' received negative critical response and little audience attention upon its first theatrical run, but it achieved a minor [[cult following]] during the early 2010s. The film has been released on various home video formats, most recently on [[Blu-ray]] in July 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nFifty years after a [[nuclear holocaust]], mankind is decimated and the surviving nations\u2014the American western-influenced Market and the Soviet-Russian-influenced Confederation\u2014have agreed to outlaw traditional open war. In their place, disputes are settled with gladiator-style matches between [[Mecha|giant robots]] operated by pilots called \"robot [[jockey|jox]]\" who are contracted to fight ten matches. The Confederation champion is Alexander ([[Paul Koslo]]), who has killed his last nine opponents thanks in part to a spy in the Market leaking information to the Confederation. The Market's champion, Achilles ([[Gary Graham]]) has won nine fights and will fight his final match against Alexander for the territory of [[Alaska]]. Achilles is supported by robot designer \"Doc\" Matsumoto ([[Danny Kamekona]]) and strategist Tex Conway (Michael Alldredge), the only jox to win all ten of his contract fights.\n\nAs Achilles gets the upper hand in the match, Alexander launches a rocket fist at him. The projectile goes out of control and heads toward the bleachers. Achilles intercepts the projectile but his robot takes the full force of the impact and is knocked into the crowd, killing over 300 people. The referees declare the match a draw and order a rematch, but Achilles, shaken by what happened, declares this was his contractual tenth match and announces his retirement. He goes to live with his brother Philip and his family, and finds he is publicly branded a traitor and a coward. Meanwhile, a new jox is chosen to face Alexander, a genetically engineered \"gen jox\" named Athena ([[Anne-Marie Johnson]]), who is the first female jox. Worried for Athena and attracted to her, Achilles returns to the Market and agrees to fight Alexander again, infuriating Athena.\n\nAs Achilles' robot is rebuilt, Matsumoto refuses to divulge any knowledge of its new weapons so it cannot be leaked by the spy, and Conway confides in Achilles he believes Matsumoto is the spy. Conway confronts Matsumoto in his office. Matsumoto reveals he has analyzed Conway's final fight and deduced that the \"lucky\" laser hit Conway claims allowed him to defeat a clearly superior opponent was in fact deliberately aimed; Matsumoto accuses Conway of being a Confederation agent. Conway confesses and shoots Matsumoto, who secretly records the deed as part of the mission briefing. Conway informs the Market leadership that Matsumoto was the spy. On the day of the fight Athena drugs Achilles and steals his jox suit to commandeer the robot. Unable to stop the fight once she takes the field, the Market decides to support her. While watching Matsumoto's briefing on the robot's new weaponry, the footage of Conway killing Matsumoto is played and Conway jumps down the robot's elevator shaft to his death.\n\nAlexander takes the field against Athena. Athena takes the early advantage, but Alexander overpowers her and incapacitates the robot. The fight is declared in Alexander's favor and referees order him to stand down. Achilles arrives on the field and takes over the robot from Athena while Alexander smashes the referee hovercraft; the two jox stand to continue the fight. Both robots take to the air and a short space battle ensues. Alexander critically damages Achilles' robot, forcing him to crash land and flee for cover to the arm of Alexander's robot Athena sliced off earlier in the fight. Achilles hotwires the arm to launch its fist at Alexander, destroying his robot. Alexander emerges from the wreckage and the two battle with poles before Achilles finally convinces Alexander a match does not have to end with the death of a jock. Alexander throws down his weapon, and they salute each other with the jox's traditional \"crash and burn\" [[fist bump]].{{#tag:ref|In 2012, Haldeman wrote that he had first heard the phrase \"crash and burn\" used as a greeting between [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racers]] during a [[Speedweeks|Speedweek]] event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joe-haldeman.livejournal.com/259568.html |first=Joe |last=Haldeman |author-link=Joe Haldeman |access-date=2013-02-17 |date=2012-01-16 |title=Slogans |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207041814/http://joe-haldeman.livejournal.com/259568.html |archive-date=2012-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Graham]] \u2013 Achilles/Jim\n* [[Anne-Marie Johnson]] \u2013 Athena\n* [[Paul Koslo]] \u2013 Alexander\n* [[Robert Sampson (actor)|Robert Sampson]] \u2013 Commissioner Jameson {{sic}}\n* [[Danny Kamekona]] \u2013 Dr. \"Doc\" Matsumoto\n* [[Hilary Mason]] \u2013 Professor Laplace\n* [[Michael Alldredge]] \u2013 Tex Conway\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] \u2013 Spectator/Prole #1\n* Michael Saad \u2013 Spectator/Prole #2\n* Ian Patrick Williams \u2013 Phillip\n* [[Jason Marsden]] \u2013 Tommy\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon \u2013 Kate\n* Thyme Lewis \u2013 Sargon\n* Gary Houston \u2013 Sportscaster\n* Russel Case \u2013 Hercules\n* [[Stuart Gordon]] (uncredited) \u2013 Bartender\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joe Haldeman Finncon2007.jpg|thumb|right|Author Joe Haldeman clashed repeatedly with director Stuart Gordon|alt=A middle-aged male in a white button-down shirt sits behind a microphone at a convention.]]\nDirector [[Stuart Gordon]] stated that the initial inspiration for ''Robot Jox'' came from the Japanese ''[[Transformers]]'' toy line:\n<blockquote>While there have been animated cartoons based on these giant robots, no one has ever attempted a live-action feature about them.

The two met when Gordon was hired to film a four-part adaptation of Haldeman's novel ''[[The Forever War]]'', but when funding for the project was cut, Gordon instead directed a stage adaptation of the book, which Haldeman also wrote. Two years later, Gordon asked Haldeman to work on a science fiction adaptation of the ''[[Iliad]]''; the idea would form the basis for what eventually became ''Robot Jox''.<ref name=\"badigest\" /> Haldeman claimed his and Gordon's visions for the film clashed: The former wanted a dramatic, serious science fiction film while the latter wanted a more audience-friendly, special effects-driven action film with stereotypical characters and stylized pseudo-science. In a one-and-a-half-page outline, Gordon inserted other elements into the plot, including the film's [[Cold War]]-era themes. Haldeman wanted to title the film ''The Mechanics'', but Gordon insisted on ''Robojox''.{{#tag:ref|After [[Orion Pictures]] threatened to sue based on the title's similarity to their 1987 film ''[[RoboCop]]'', producers changed the title to ''Robot Jox''.<ref name=\"HorrorFan\" />|group=\"Note\"}} According to Haldeman:\n<blockquote>I would try to change the science into something reasonable; Stuart would change it back to [[Saturday morning cartoon]] stuff. I tried to make believable, reasonable characters, and Stuart would insist on throwing in clich\u00e9s and caricatures.

Haldeman wrote that Gordon later recognized that the author was \"writing a movie for adults that children can enjoy\" while Gordon had been \"directing a movie for children that adults can enjoy.\"<ref name=\"Haldeman interview\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began in [[Rome]] in January 1987 and ended in April. During filming, the producers brought in Haldeman to work with the film's principal actors.<ref name=\"Haldeman interview\" /> Afterwards, Allen began to produce the film's special effects sequences. [[Ron Cobb]] helped design the robots for these scenes.
