The [[screenplay]] was written by Kubrick and science fiction author [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and was inspired by Clarke's 1951 short story \"[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]\" and other short stories by Clarke. Clarke also published a [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|novelisation of the film]], in part written concurrently with the screenplay, after the film's release. The film stars [[Keir Dullea]], [[Gary Lockwood]], [[William Sylvester]], and [[Douglas Rain]], and follows a voyage by astronauts, scientists and the [[sentience|sentient]] supercomputer [[HAL 9000|HAL]] to [[Jupiter]] to investigate an [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|alien monolith]].\n\nThe film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight, pioneering [[special effects]], and ambiguous imagery. Kubrick avoided conventional cinematic and narrative techniques; dialogue is used sparingly, and there are long sequences accompanied only by music. The soundtrack incorporates numerous works of [[classical music]], by composers including [[Richard Strauss]], [[Johann Strauss II]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], and [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]].\n\nThe film received diverse critical responses, ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity. Critics noted its exploration of themes such as [[human evolution]], [[technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], and the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]]. It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], winning Kubrick the award for his direction of the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|visual effects]]. The film is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]]. In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=15 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507094100/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|archive-date=7 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=U.S. FILM REGISTRY ADDS 25 'SIGNIFICANT' MOVIES |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html |last=Kehr |first=Dave |website=chicagotribune.com |language=en-US|access-date=15 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617031520/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html|archive-date=17 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please do not expand this section significantly without consensus, per the plot summary length guidelines at [[WP:FILMPLOT]] (2nd paragraph).

The next day, they find an [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|alien monolith]] has appeared in their midst; they then learn how to use a bone as a weapon and, after their first hunt, return to drive their rivals away with the newly discovered tool.\n\nMillions of years later, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, a US [[lunar outpost]]. During a stopover at Space Station 5, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Heywood addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, an identical monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]]. He and others ride in a Moonbus to the monolith. As they examine the object, it is struck by sunlight, upon which it emits a high-powered radio signal.\n\nEighteen months later, the American spacecraft ''[[Discovery One]]'' is bound for [[Jupiter]], with mission pilots and scientists Dr. David \"Dave\" Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in [[suspended animation]]. Most of ''Discovery''{{'}}s operations are controlled by HAL, a [[HAL 9000]] computer with a human personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Dave retrieves it in an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA) pod but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. [[Mission Control]] advises the astronauts that results from their twin 9000 computer indicate that HAL is in error about the reporting, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Dave and Frank enter an EVA pod so they can talk without HAL overhearing, and agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. However, HAL follows their conversation by [[lip reading]].\n\nWhile Frank is on a space walk attempting to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of his pod, setting him adrift. Dave takes another pod to rescue Frank; while he is outside, HAL turns off the [[life support]] functions of the three other crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Dave returns to the ship with Frank's body, HAL refuses to let him in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Dave releases Frank's body and opens the ship's emergency airlock manually. He proceeds to HAL's [[processor core]] and begins disconnecting HAL's circuits despite HAL begging him not to. When disconnection is complete, a prerecorded video by Heywood plays, revealing that the mission's objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter.\n\nAt Jupiter, Dave finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves ''Discovery'' in an EVA pod to investigate, but is pulled into a vortex of coloured light. Dave is carried across vast distances of space, while viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours. Eventually he finds himself in a large [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying on a bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Dave reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light, which floats in space above the Earth.\n\n== Cast

Clarke and Stanley Kubrick\" to reflect their preeminence in their respective fields.<ref>{{harvnb|Agel|1970|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> In practice, the screenplay developed in parallel with the novel, with only some elements being common to both. In a 1970 interview, Kubrick said:\n\n{{blockquote|There are a number of differences between the book and the movie. The novel, for example, attempts to explain things much more explicitly than the film does, which is inevitable in a verbal medium. The novel came about after we did a 130-page prose treatment of the film at the very outset.{{nbsp}}... Arthur took all the existing material, plus an impression of some of the rushes, and wrote the novel. As a result, there's a difference between the novel and the film&nbsp;... I think that the divergences between the two works are interesting.<ref name=\"Gelmis\" />}}\n\nIn the end, Clarke and Kubrick wrote parts of the novel and screenplay simultaneously, with the film version being released before the book version was published. Clarke opted for clearer explanations of the mysterious monolith and Star Gate in the novel; Kubrick made the film more cryptic by minimising dialogue and explanation.<ref name=\"krusch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html |title=What did Kubrick have to say about what 2001 \"means\"? |website=Krusch.com |access-date=22 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927064037/http://www.krusch.com/kubrick/Q12.html |archive-date=27 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Kubrick said the film is \"basically a visual, nonverbal experience\" that \"hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gelmis|1970|p=302}}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay credits were shared whereas the ''2001'' novel, released shortly after the film, was attributed to Clarke alone.

Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece'', the actual relation between Clarke and Kubrick was more complex, involving an extended interaction of Kubrick's multiple requests for Clarke to write new plot lines for various segments of the film, which Clarke was expected to withhold from publication until after the release of the film while receiving advances on his salary from Kubrick during film production. Clarke agreed to this, though apparently he did make several requests for Kubrick to allow him to develop his new plot lines into separate publishable stories while film production continued, which Kubrick consistently denied on the basis of Clarke's contractual obligation to withhold publication until release of the film.<ref name=\"Benson's Book\" />\n\nAstronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote in his book ''[[The Cosmic Connection]]'' that Clarke and Kubrick had asked him how to best depict [[extraterrestrial intelligence]]. While acknowledging Kubrick's desire to use actors to portray humanoid aliens for convenience's sake, Sagan argued that alien life forms were unlikely to bear any resemblance to terrestrial life, and that to do so would introduce \"at least an element of falseness\" to the film. Sagan proposed that the film should simply suggest extraterrestrial [[superintelligence]], rather than depict it. He attended the premiere and was \"pleased to see that I had been of some help.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Carl Sagan's cosmic connection: an extraterrestrial perspective |edition=2nd |first1=Carl |last1=Sagan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-78303-8 |page=183 |access-date=27 January 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lL57o9YB0mAC |chapter=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330140644/https://books.google.com/books?id=lL57o9YB0mAC|archive-date=30 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Sagan had met with Clarke and Kubrick only once, in 1964; and Kubrick subsequently directed several attempts to portray credible aliens, only to abandon the idea near the end of post-production. Benson asserts it is unlikely that Sagan's advice had any direct influence.<ref name=\"Benson's Book\" /> Kubrick hinted at the nature of the mysterious unseen alien race in ''2001'' by suggesting that given millions of years of evolution, they progressed from biological beings to \"immortal machine entities\" and then into \"beings of pure energy and spirit\" with \"limitless capabilities and ungraspable intelligence\".<ref name=\"Playboy\">{{cite journal |title=Stanley Kubrick: Playboy Interview |journal=Playboy |date=September 1968 |url=http://www.archiviokubrick.it/english/words/interviews/index.html |access-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715101917/http://www.archiviokubrick.it/english/words/interviews/index.html |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1980 interview (not released during Kubrick's lifetime), Kubrick explains one of the film's closing scenes, where Bowman is depicted in old age after his journey through the Star Gate:\n\n{{blockquote|The idea was supposed to be that he is taken in by godlike entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time.{{nbsp}}...

In early 1965, when backing was secured for the film, Clarke and Kubrick still had no firm idea of what would happen to Bowman after the Star Gate sequence. Initially all of ''Discovery''{{'}}s astronauts were to survive the journey; by 3 October, Clarke and Kubrick had decided to make Bowman the sole survivor and have him regress to infancy. By 17 October, Kubrick had come up with what Clarke called a \"wild idea of slightly [[Fagging|fag]] robots who create a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] environment to put our heroes at their ease.\"<ref name=\"Clarke pp.31-38\" /> HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the [[Athena|Greek goddess of wisdom]] and had a feminine voice and persona.<ref name=\"Clarke pp.31-38\" />\n\nEarly drafts included a prologue containing interviews with scientists about extraterrestrial life,<ref name=\"Agel p.48\">{{Harvnb|Agel|1970|p=48}}.</ref> [[voice-over]] narration (a feature in all of Kubrick's previous films),{{efn|Jason Sperb's study of Kubrick ''The Kubrick Facade'' analyses Kubrick's use of narration in detail.

The first design for the monolith for the ''2001'' film was a transparent [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] pyramid.

Their sizes ranged from about two-foot-long models of satellites and the Aries translunar shuttle up to the {{convert|55|ft|adj=on}}-long model of the ''Discovery One'' spacecraft. \"In-camera\" techniques were again used as much as possible to combine models and background shots together to prevent degradation of the image through duplication.<ref name=\"online excerpt\">{{cite journal |last=Trumbull |first=Douglas |title=Creating Special Effects for ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' |url=http://cinetropolis.net/vintage-article-by-douglas-trumbull-on-creating-special-effects-for-2001-a-space-odyssey/ |journal=American Cinematographer |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=412\u2013413, 420\u2013422, 416\u2013419, 441\u2013447, 451\u2013454, 459\u2013461 |date=June 1968 |via=Cinetropolis |access-date=7 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613162305/http://cinetropolis.net/vintage-article-by-douglas-trumbull-on-creating-special-effects-for-2001-a-space-odyssey/ |archive-date=13 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schwam|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=j_EmH_W4I7YC&pg=PT151 151ff]}}</ref>\n\nIn shots where there was no perspective change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an [[animation stand]]. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] to block out where the spaceship image was.<ref name=\"online excerpt\" />\n\nShots where the spacecraft had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots the model was stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor\u2014making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on the same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long ''Discovery One'' spacecraft, in order to keep the entire model in focus (and preserve its sense of scale), the camera's aperture was stopped down for maximum depth-of-field, and each frame was exposed for several seconds.<ref name=\"Bizony 2001, pp. 112-113\">{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|pp=112\u2013113}}</ref> Many [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with filmmakers sometimes resorting to hand-tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft ([[rotoscoping]]) to create the matte.<ref name=\"online excerpt\" /><ref name=\"Bizony 2001, pp. 113\u2013117\">{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|pp=113\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nSome shots required exposing the film again to record previously filmed live-action shots of the people appearing in the windows of the spacecraft or structures. This was achieved by projecting the window action onto the models in a separate camera pass or, when two-dimensional photographs were used, projecting from the backside through a hole cut in the photograph.<ref name=\"Bizony 2001, pp. 112-113\" />\n\nAll of the shots required multiple takes so that some film could be developed and printed to check exposure, density, alignment of elements, and to supply footage used for other photographic effects, such as for matting.<ref name=\"online excerpt\" /><ref name=\"Bizony 2001, pp. 113\u2013117\" />\n\n=== Rotating sets ===\n[[File:2001 CENTRIFUGE SET.jpg|thumb|right|The \"centrifuge\" set used for filming scenes depicting interior of the spaceship ''Discovery'']]\n\nFor spacecraft interior shots, ostensibly containing a giant centrifuge that produces [[Rotational gravity|artificial gravity]], Kubrick had a {{convert|30|ST|adj=on}} rotating \"ferris wheel\" built by [[Vickers-Armstrong]] Engineering Group at a cost of $750,000. The set was {{convert|38|ft}} in diameter and {{convert|10|ft}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |first=George D. |last=DeMet |url=http://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/dfx.html |title=The Special Effects of '2001: A Space Odyssey'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060702/http://www.palantir.net/2001/meanings/dfx.html |archive-date=9 May 2008 |work=DFX |date=July 1999}}</ref> Various scenes in the ''Discovery'' centrifuge were shot by securing set pieces within the wheel, then rotating it while the actor walked or ran in sync with its motion, keeping him at the bottom of the wheel as it turned. The camera could be fixed to the inside of the rotating wheel to show the actor walking completely \"around\" the set, or mounted in such a way that the wheel rotated independently of the stationary camera, as in the jogging scene where the camera appears to alternately precede and follow the running actor.<ref name=\"Bizony 2001 138\u2013144\">{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|pp=138\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nThe shots where the actors appear on opposite sides of the wheel required one of the actors to be strapped securely into place at the \"top\" of the wheel as it moved to allow the other actor to walk to the \"bottom\" of the wheel to join him. The most notable case is when Bowman enters the centrifuge from the central hub on a ladder, and joins Poole, who is eating on the other side of the centrifuge. This required Gary Lockwood to be strapped into a seat while Keir Dullea walked toward him from the opposite side of the wheel as it turned with him.<ref name=\"Bizony 2001 138\u2013144\" />\n\nAnother rotating set appeared in an earlier sequence on board the Aries trans-lunar shuttle. A stewardess is shown preparing in-flight meals, then carrying them into a circular walkway. Attached to the set as it rotates 180 degrees, the camera's point of view remains constant, and she appears to walk up the \"side\" of the circular walkway, and steps, now in an \"upside-down\" orientation, into a connecting hallway.<ref>{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|p=144}}.</ref>\n\n=== Zero-gravity effects ===\nThe realistic-looking effects of the astronauts floating weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached to the top of the set and placing the camera beneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the wires and appeared to float. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's recovery of him, a stuntman on a wire portrayed the movements of an unconscious man and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space.<ref>{{harvnb|Agel|1970|pp=129\u2013135}}</ref> The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the EVA pod was done similarly: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically oriented airlock. At the proper moment, the stage-hand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back toward the hatch.<ref name=\"2001:A Space Odyssey\">{{cite video |people=Jan Harlan, Stanley Kubrick |date=October 2007 |title=2001:A Space Odyssey |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref>\n\nThe methods used were alleged to have placed stuntman [[Bill Weston]]'s life in danger. Weston recalled that he filmed one sequence without air-holes in his suit, risking asphyxiation. \"Even when the tank was feeding air into the suit, there was no place for the carbon dioxide Weston exhaled to go. So it simply built up inside, incrementally causing a heightened heart rate, rapid breathing, fatigue, clumsiness, and eventually, unconsciousness.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/stanley-kubrick-risked-stuntman-life-making-2001-a-space-oydssey |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |work=The Guardian |date=5 April 2018 |title=Stanley Kubrick 'risked stuntman's life' making 2001: A Space Odyssey|access-date=23 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021155514/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/05/stanley-kubrick-risked-stuntman-life-making-2001-a-space-oydssey|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Weston said Kubrick was warned \"we've got to get him back\" but reportedly replied, \"Damn it, we just started.

Kubrick used the technique to produce the backdrops in the Africa scenes and the scene when astronauts walk on the Moon.<ref>{{harvnb|Bizony|2001|p=133}}</ref><ref name=\"front_projection\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thepropgallery.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-dawn-of-front-projection |title=2001: A Space Odyssey \u2013 The Dawn of Front Projection |work=The Prop Gallery |access-date=4 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615063650/http://www.thepropgallery.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-dawn-of-front-projection|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe technique consisted of a separate scenery projector set at a right angle to the camera and a half-silvered mirror placed at an angle in front that reflected the projected image forward in line with the camera lens onto a backdrop of retroreflective material. The reflective directional screen behind the actors could reflect light from the projected image 100 times more efficiently than the foreground subject did. The lighting of the foreground subject had to be balanced with the image from the screen, so that the part of the scenery image that fell on the foreground subject was too faint to show on the finished film. The exception was the eyes of the [[leopard]] in the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence, which glowed due to the projector illumination. Kubrick described this as \"a happy accident\".<ref name=\"Herb A.

The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen {{convert|40|ft}} tall and {{convert|110|ft}} wide, far larger than had been used before. When the reflective material was applied to the backdrop in {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} strips, variations at the seams of the strips led to visual artefacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random \"camouflage\" pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using {{convert|4|xx|5|in|cm|adj=on}} transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special-effects supervisor [[Tom Howard (special effects)|Tom Howard]] to build a custom projector using {{convert|8|xx|10|in|cm|adj=on}} transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available.<ref name=\"Herb A.

In his [[monograph]] for BFI analysing the film, Peter Kr\u00e4mer summarised the diverse interpretations as ranging from those who saw it as darkly [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] in tone to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of mankind and humanity.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{harvnb|Kr\u00e4mer|2010|p=8}}</ref> Questions about ''2001'' range from uncertainty about its implications for humanity's origins and destiny in the universe<ref>See especially the essay \"Auteur with a Capital A\", by James Gilbert, anthologized in {{harvnb|Kolker|2006}}.</ref> to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes, such as the meaning of the monolith, or the fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about the plot, in particular the causes of HAL's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).<ref>{{harvnb|Schwam|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=j_EmH_W4I7YC&pg=PT86 86]}}</ref><ref name=\"SF-20180706\">{{cite web |last=Pearson |first=Ben |title=Stanley Kubrick Explains The '2001: A Space Odyssey' Ending in Rediscovered Interview |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-ending/ |date=6 July 2018 |work=[[Slashfilm]] |access-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706174351/https://www.slashfilm.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-ending/ |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"SYFY-20180705\">{{cite web |last=Slayton |first=Nicholas |title=In Lost Interview, Stanley Kubrick Explains The Ending of 2001: A Space odyssey |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/in-lost-interview-stanley-kubrick-explains-the-ending-of-2001-a-space-odyssey |date=5 July 2018 |work=[[SyfyWire]] |access-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706010257/http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/in-lost-interview-stanley-kubrick-explains-the-ending-of-2001-a-space-odyssey |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20180418\">{{cite news |last=Handy |first=Bruce |title=Sometimes a Broken Glass Is Just a Broken Glass |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/opinion/2001-a-space-odyssey-broken-glass.html |date=5 April 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407140425/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/opinion/2001-a-space-odyssey-broken-glass.html |archive-date=7 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Audiences vs. critics ===\nA spectrum of diverse interpretative opinions would form after the film's release, appearing to divide theatre audiences from the opinions of critics. Kr\u00e4mer writes: \"Many people sent letters to Kubrick to tell him about their responses to ''2001'', most of them regarding the film\u2014in particular the ending\u2014as an optimistic statement about humanity, which is seen to be born and reborn. The film's reviewers and academic critics, by contrast, have tended to understand the film as a pessimistic account of human nature and humanity's future. The most extreme of these interpretations state that the foetus floating above the Earth will destroy it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kr\u00e4mer|2010|p=7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|left|Closing scene of ''Dr. Strangelove'' and Kubrick's sardonic fulfilment of a nuclear nightmare]]\n\nSome of the critics' cataclysmic interpretations were informed by Kubrick's prior direction of the [[Cold War]] film ''Dr. Strangelove'', immediately before ''2001'', which resulted in dark speculation about the nuclear weapons orbiting the Earth in ''2001''. These interpretations were challenged by Clarke, who said: \"Many readers have interpreted the last paragraph of the book to mean that he (the foetus) destroyed Earth, perhaps for the purpose of creating a new Heaven. This idea never occurred to me; it seems clear that he triggered the orbiting nuclear bombs harmlessly{{nbsp}}...\".<ref name=\"auto1\" /> In response to Jeremy Bernstein's dark interpretation of the film's ending, Kubrick said: \"The book does not end with the destruction of the Earth.\"<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\nRegarding the film as a whole, Kubrick encouraged people to make their own interpretations and refused to offer an explanation of \"what really happened\". In a 1968 interview with [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]], he said:\n\n{{blockquote|You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and [[allegory|allegorical]] meaning of the film\u2014and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level\u2014but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ''2001'' that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point.<ref name=\"Playboy\" />}}\n\nIn a subsequent discussion of the film with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick said his main aim was to avoid \"intellectual verbalization\" and reach \"the viewer's subconscious.\" But he said he did not strive for ambiguity\u2014it was simply an inevitable outcome of making the film nonverbal. Still, he acknowledged this ambiguity was an invaluable asset to the film. He was willing then to give a fairly straightforward explanation of the plot on what he called the \"simplest level,\" but unwilling to discuss the film's metaphysical interpretation, which he felt should be left up to viewers.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelmis|1970|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n=== Meaning of the monolith ===\nFor some readers, Clarke's more straightforward novel based on the script is key to interpreting the film. The novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race that has been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]] wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key aspects from the film, it perhaps should not be regarded as the skeleton key to unlock it.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Houston |first=Penelope |title=Skeleton Key to 2001 |journal=Sight and Sound International Film Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1971 |location=London |publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref>\n\n[[File:African monolith 2001.jpg|thumb|right|Multiple interpretations of the meaning of the monolith have been examined in the critical reception of the film]]\n\nCarolyn Geduld writes that what \"structurally unites all four episodes of the film\" is the monolith, the film's largest and most unresolvable enigma.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Geduld|1973|p=40}}</ref> Vincent LoBrutto's biography of Kubrick says that for many, Clarke's novel supplements the understanding of the monolith which is more ambiguously depicted in the film.<ref>{{harvnb|LoBrutto|1998|pp=310, 606}}</ref> Similarly, Geduld observes that \"the monolith&nbsp;... has a very simple explanation in Clarke's novel\", though she later asserts that even the novel does not fully explain the ending.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nBob McClay's ''Rolling Stone'' review describes a parallelism between the monolith's first appearance in which tool usage is imparted to the apes (thus 'beginning' mankind) and the completion of \"another evolution\" in the fourth and final encounter<ref>{{harvnb|Schwam|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=yX1ZAAAAMAAJ 165]}}</ref> with the monolith.

He has been compared to [[Frankenstein's monster]]. In Clarke's novel, HAL malfunctions because of being ordered to lie to the crew of ''Discovery'' and withhold confidential information from them, namely the confidentially programmed mission priority over expendable human life, despite being constructed for \"the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment\". This would not be addressed on film until the 1984 follow-up, ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]''. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that HAL, as the supposedly perfect computer, is actually the most human of the characters.<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> In an interview with Joseph Gelmis in 1969, Kubrick said that HAL \"had an acute emotional crisis because he could not accept evidence of his own fallibility\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html |title=An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969) |first=Joseph |last=Gelmis |access-date=31 August 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100419155630/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html|archive-date= 19 April 2010|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Star Child\" symbolism ===\nMultiple allegorical interpretations of ''2001'' have been proposed.
