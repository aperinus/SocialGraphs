Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the parked vehicle of Sheriff Wynan as Wynan is engaged in sex with another man. Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete to look for the vehicle involved.\n\nSarah tricks the boys into drinking drugged beer, and they pass out. Jarod wakes up in a covered cage and realizes he is inside Five Points Trinity Church, a fanatically conservative church, after he identifies church leader (and Sarah's father) Abin Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon. His followers ritually murder a captive gay man and drop him into a crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together. Cooper begins preparing Jarod to be murdered in the same way, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church.\n\nTravis and Billy Ray manage to cut themselves free, but are overheard by Sarah's husband, Caleb. Travis fails to escape his binds, so Billy Ray abandons him. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Cooper's son Mordechai. Cooper blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife. Wynan calls Agent Joseph Keenan of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], who begins setting up outside the church.\n\nTravis breaks free, arms himself and plans to shoot the congregation, but witnesses Jarod being held captive in the church. Travis instead flees the church, but is mistaken for a member by Wynan and shot. Keenan tries to reason with the group, but Cooper shoots an ATF agent. A shoot-out erupts and Wynan is killed. The ATF orders Keenan to stage a full military raid on the church to eliminate all witnesses. Keenan passes the order on to ATF Agent Harry, who refuses.\n\nDuring the shoot-out, Sarah's daughter Cheyenne escapes and is captured by an ATF agent. Sarah kills him as he is about to shoot Cheyenne. Cheyenne returns to the house and frees Jarod, begging him to help her hide the congregation's children. He refuses and she attacks him. Sarah attacks Jarod, and Cheyenne accidentally shoots and kills Sarah. Jarod decides to help Cheyenne hide the children. They plead with Keenan to spare the children but are both killed by Harry. The shoot-out is interrupted by a mysterious trumpet blast. The church congregation members lower their weapons and run outside rejoicing, claiming that the [[Rapture]] has occurred and taunting the ATF.\n\nThe film cuts to a government briefing several days later. Keenan reports that he head-butted Cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. He explains that the trumpet noises were a prank by a group of local college students irritated with Cooper. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors. They explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was personal and that they are satisfied with incarcerating the congregation without trials, upsetting Keenan. Cooper is seen pacing around his cell singing and sermonizing until another prisoner tells him to shut up.\n\n===Original ending===\nDuring various interactive Q&As for the film, Smith has stated that the original ending continued with [[the Rapture]] happening and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] descending on the scene.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venkman|title=RT-UK Exclusive: Kevin Smith's Horror Project Revealed|publisher=Geekly Rant|date=January 25, 2011|access-date=January 25, 2011|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/1/26/sundance-2011-kevin-smiths-red-state-qa-reveals-his-original.html}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|* [[Anna Gunn]] as Travis' Mother\n* [[Michael Parks]] as Pastor Abin Cooper\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] Special Agent Joe Keenan\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Sarah Cooper, Pastor Cooper's daughter, Caleb's wife and Cheyenne's mother\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Jarod\n* [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]] as Cheyenne Cooper, Sarah and Caleb's daughter and Abin Cooper's granddaughter\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Travis\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Billy Ray\n* [[Ralph Garman]] as Caleb Cooper, Sarah's husband, Abin Cooper's son-in-law and Cheyenne's father\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Sheriff Wynan\n* [[James Parks (actor)|James Parks]] as Mordechai Cooper, Pastor Cooper's son and Fiona May's father\n* [[Haley Ramm]] as Maggie Cooper\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as ATF Special Agent Brooks\n* [[Matt L.

But one source who has worked with him thinks Smith might be one of the first filmmakers to exploit and then be undone by social media, and that access to social media has eliminated any filter that might have protected Smith from emotional outbursts that, in this person's view, have undermined his career.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\" /></blockquote>\n\nSmith responded to Masters, saying that it was \"a ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' moment. I've got a little fish in a plastic bag and one idealistic secretary on my side, and the Bob Sugars seem to be leaning in doorways, smirking.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Kevin |last=Smith |url=http://theredstatements.com/2011/02/01/some-questions-answers-about-red-state/ |title=Some questions & answers about Red State |date=February 1, 2011 |access-date=August 5, 2011 |work=theredstatements.com}}</ref>\n\n===Indie Film 2.0===\nSmith described his motivations, strategy, and thought process behind the marketing method at his Sundance appearance<ref name=\"indiewire1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin_smiths_red_state_auction_is_a_hoax_filmmaker_will_self-distribute_hor |title=Kevin Smith's 'Red State' Auction Is A Hoax; Filmmaker Will Self-Distribute, Horror Arrives Oct 19&#124;The Playlist |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |date=January 24, 2011 |access-date=June 8, 2014}}</ref> and on various podcast shows, Q&As,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/kevin-smith-buys-film-sundance-auction-swears-distributors-announces-full-details-selfdistribution/ |title=Kevin Smith Buys His Own Film At Sundance Auction, Swears Off Distributors, and Announces Full Details for Self-Distribution - /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=January 23, 2011 |access-date=June 8, 2014}}</ref> and tweets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |url=https://vulture.com/2011/01/kevin_smith_twitter.html |title=Kevin Smith Takes On the Red State Backlash in Two-Hour Tweet-a-thon |publisher=Vulture |date=May 15, 2014 |access-date=June 8, 2014}}</ref> He described the strategy as carefully planned with his business partners, including Jonathan Gordon, who had recently had an interesting experience as a short-lived executive at Universal.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/2006/film/news/gordon-ends-short-u-stint-1200342570/ | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Gordon ends short U stint|access-date=September 29, 2015|date=August 3, 2006|first1=Gabriel|last1=Snyder}}</ref> Smith did not take a salary for the film, noting that the plan was to pay investors back first.\n\nIn his Sundance Q&A, Smith compared the Indie scene from the 1990s to the present film landscape. He described the traditional film marketing system, in which studios buy films and then spend large amounts of money marketing it (often comparable to the film cost). He noted that it took seven years for his film ''Clerks'' to become profitable due to this system (see [[Hollywood accounting]]). He also compared selling a film to giving a child away for someone else to raise it.<ref name=\"indiewire1\" /> Other telling quotes from his Sundance appearance referenced a sort of rebirth of the notion of independence in show business.\n\n<blockquote>\"We're starting over ... true independence isn't making a film and selling it to some jackass.
