The script by Richard Maxwell and Adam Rodman is loosely based on the [[The Serpent and the Rainbow (book)|non-fiction book of the same name]] by [[Ethnobotany|ethnobotanist]] [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], wherein Davis recounted his experiences in [[Haiti]] investigating the story of [[Clairvius Narcisse]], who was allegedly poisoned, buried alive, and revived with an herbal brew which produced what was called a [[zombie]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1978, a Haitian man named Christophe mysteriously dies in a French missionary clinic, while a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] parade marches past his window. The next morning, Christophe is buried in a traditional Catholic funeral. A mysterious man dressed in a suit who was outside Christophe's hospital window on the night he died is in attendance. As the coffin is lowered into the ground, Christophe's eyes open and tears roll down his cheeks.\n\nSeven years later, [[Harvard]] [[anthropologist]] Dennis Alan is in the [[Amazon rainforest]] studying rare herbs and medicines with a local [[Shamanism|shaman]]. He drinks a [[potion]] and experiences a [[hallucination]] of the same black man from Christophe's funeral, surrounded by [[corpses]] in a [[Bottomless pit (Bible)|bottomless pit]].\n\nBack in [[Boston]], Alan is approached by a pharmaceutical company looking to investigate a drug used in [[Haitian Vodou]] to create [[zombie]]s. The company wants Alan to acquire the drug for use as a \"super [[anesthetic]]\". The corporation provides Alan with funding and sends him to [[Haiti]], which is in the middle of a [[Anti-Duvalier protest movement|revolution]]. Alan's exploration in Haiti, assisted by Dr. Marielle Duchamp, locates Christophe who is alive after having been buried seven years earlier. Alan is taken into custody, and the commander of the ''[[Tonton Macoute]]'', Captain Dargent Peytraud\u2013the same man from Christophe's funeral and Alan's vision in the Amazon\u2013warns Alan to leave Haiti.\n\nContinuing his investigation, Alan finds a local man, Mozart, who is reported to have knowledge of the procedure for creating the zombie drug. Alan pays Mozart for a sample, but Mozart sells him rat poison instead. After embarrassing Mozart in public, Alan convinces Mozart to show Alan how to produce the drug for a fee of $1,000. Alan is arrested again by the ''Tonton Macoutes'', and tortured by having a nail driven through his scrotum, and then dumped on a street with the message that he must leave Haiti or be killed. Alan again refuses to leave and meets with Mozart to create the drug.\n\nAlan has a nightmare of Peytraud, revealed to be a ''[[bokor]]'' who turns enemies into zombies and steals their souls. When Alan wakes up, he is lying next to Christophe's sister who has been decapitated. The ''Tonton Macoutes'' enter, take photos, and frame Alan for murder. Peytraud tells Alan to leave the country and never return, lest he be convicted of the murder, executed, and then his soul stolen by Peytraud. Peytraud puts Alan on a US bound plane, but Mozart sneaks on board and gives Alan the zombie drug. Mozart asks Alan to tell people about him, so that Mozart can achieve international fame. Alan agrees and returns to Boston with his mission apparently completed.\n\nAt a celebration dinner, the wife of Alan's employer is possessed by Peytraud, who warns Alan of his own imminent death. Alan returns to Haiti, where his only ally, a ''[[houngan]]'' named Lucien Celine, is killed by Peytraud and Mozart is beheaded as a sacrifice for Peytraud's power. Alan is then sprayed with the [[Tetrodotoxin|zombie powder]] and dies; later, Peytraud steals Alan's body from the hospital before the death can be reported to the US Embassy. Peytraud takes Alan to a graveyard where, helpless in his coffin, Alan sees that Peytraud has captured Marielle and will sacrifice her. Peytraud shows Alan Celine's soul in a ''canari''. Alan is then buried alive with a [[tarantula]] to \"keep him company\". Waking up in his coffin a few hours later, Alan is rescued by Christophe who was also turned into a zombie by Peytraud.\n\nHaving escaped Peytraud's trap, Alan returns to the ''Tonton Macoute'' headquarters looking for Marielle. There, Alan defeats Peytraud through a battles of wills, using Celine's white magic to drive a nail into Peytraud's groin, and sends his soul to hell. As the Haitian people celebrate the downfall of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], Marielle proclaims \"The nightmare is over\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Dr. Dennis Alan\n* [[Cathy Tyson]] as Dr. Marielle Duchamp\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Captain Dargent Peytraud\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Lucien Celine\n* [[Brent Jennings]] as Louis Mozart\n* [[Conrad Roberts]] as Christophe Durand\n* [[Aleta Mitchell]] as Celestine Durand\n* [[Badja Djola]] as Lieutenant Gaston\n* [[Michael Gough]] as Dr. Earl \"Schoonie\" Schoonbacher\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Dr. Andrew Cassedy\n* [[Dey Young]] as Deborah Cassedy\n* Luis Tavare Pesquera as Kyle Cassedy\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as French Missonary Doctor\n* [[Francis Guinan]] as American Doctor\n* Jaime Pina Gautier as Julio, Dennis' Helicopter Pilot\n* Philogen Thomas as Priest\n* Evencio Mosquera Slaco as Old Shaman\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\n''The Serpent and the Rainbow'' was filmed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[Santo Domingo]] in the [[Dominican Republic]], and in [[Haiti]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) \u2013 Filming Locations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096071/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt|website=IMDb.com|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref> During production in Haiti, the local government informed the cast and crew that they could not guarantee their safety for the remainder of the film's shoot because of the political strife and civil turmoil that was occurring during that time; as a result, production was relocated to the Dominican Republic for the remainder of the shoot.\n\n==Release==\n===Rating===\nIn an interview, Craven stated that unlike his previous films that had problems with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the first cut got an R rating without any problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://crypticrock.com/wes-craven-dreaming-up-nightmares-that-will-last-forever/|title=Wes Craven \u2013 Dreaming Up Nightmares That Will Last Forever|first=Robyn|last=Andrew|publisher=Cryptic Rock|date=18 September 2015|access-date=25 September 2022}}</ref> According to an article from Fangoria #71, the original cut was 184 minutes long but Craven felt that it was too long and talky so he cut it down to 98 minutes.
