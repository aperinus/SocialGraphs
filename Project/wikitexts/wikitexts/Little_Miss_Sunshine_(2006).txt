Her gay brother, Frank, an unemployed scholar of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], is temporarily living with the family after having [[Suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]. Sheryl's husband Richard is a [[Type A and Type B personality theory|Type A]] striving to build a career as a [[motivational speaker]] and [[life coaching|life coach]]. Dwayne, Sheryl's [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]-reading teenage son from a previous marriage, has taken a [[vow of silence]] until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a [[fighter pilot]]. Richard's foul-mouthed father, Edwin, lives with the family after being evicted from a [[retirement home]] for snorting [[heroin]]. Olive, the daughter of Richard and Sheryl and the youngest of the Hoover family, is an aspiring [[Beauty pageant|beauty queen]] who is coached by Edwin.\n\nOlive learns she has qualified for the \"Little Miss Sunshine\" beauty pageant, being held in [[Redondo Beach, California]] in two days. Richard, Sheryl, and Edwin want to support her, and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone, so the whole family goes. Because they have little money, they go on an 800-mile road trip in their yellow [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen van]]. Family tensions play out along the way, amidst the aging van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20&nbsp;mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself, which leads to the family being pulled over by a state trooper.\n[[File: VW T2 campervan.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A yellow and white Volkswagen Type 2 vehicle with a dirty roof is parked on a street.|A [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen T2 Microbus]], similar to the one in the film]]\n\nThroughout the trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discover their need for each other's support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin dies from a heroin [[drug overdose|overdose]], and the family has to smuggle his body out of the hospital. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers that he is [[Color blindness|color blind]], meaning he cannot become a pilot. This prompts him to finally break his silence and shout his disdain for his family, though apologizing after Olive calms him with a hug.\n\nAfter a frantic race against the clock, the family arrives at the pageant hotel. The other contestants are slim, [[Sexualization in child beauty pageants|sexualized]] pre-teen girls who perform elaborate dance numbers with great panache. Richard and Dwayne realize that the amateur Olive is certain to be humiliated and try to talk her out of performing. Sheryl insists that they \"let Olive be Olive\", and Olive goes on stage, revealing her hitherto-unseen dance routine that Edwin had taught her to be a [[striptease]] performed to a [[Rocasound]] revamp of [[Rick James]]' \"[[Super Freak]]\". Despite the other girls being over-sexualized, Olive's [[burlesque]] performance horrifies most of the audience and organizers, who demand Olive be removed from the stage. The members of the Hoover family join Olive onstage and dance alongside her to show their support.\n\nThe family is later released from the hotel's security office on the condition that Olive never enters a beauty pageant in California ever again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel's toll booth and begin their trip back home to Albuquerque.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Richard Hoover\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Dr. Frank Ginsberg\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Sheryl Hoover\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Dwayne Hoover\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Olive Hoover\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Edwin Hoover\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Stan Grossman\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Pageant Official Jenkins\n* [[Wallace Langham]] as Kirby\n* [[Matt Winston]] as Pageant MC\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Mechanic\n* [[Paula Newsome]] as Linda\n* [[Dean Norris]] as State Trooper McCleary\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Pageant Assistant Pam\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=You start off with all these people living their separate lives and the climax of the movie is them all jumping up onstage together.
