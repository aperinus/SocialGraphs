When she doesn't pay a fine, her furniture is to be repossessed.  However her neighbors assist her by hiding the furniture. A lawyer who lives in the neighborhood advises Carmine that, as the fine and furniture are in Adelina's name, she will be imprisoned. However, Italian law stipulates that women cannot be imprisoned when pregnant or within six months after a pregnancy. As a result, Adelina schemes to stay pregnant continuously. After seven children in eight years, Carmine is seriously exhausted and Adelina must make the choice of being impregnated by their mutual friend Pasquale ([[Aldo Giuffr\u00e8]]) or be incarcerated.\n\nShe finally chooses to be incarcerated, and the whole neighborhood gathers money to free her and petition for her pardon, which finally comes and she is reunited with her husband Carmine and their children.\n\n===Anna of Milan===\nAnna ([[Sophia Loren]] dressed by [[Christian Dior]]), the wife of a mega-rich industrialist, has a lover named Renzo ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]).  Whilst driving together in her husband's [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], Anna must determine which is the most important to her happiness \u2013 Renzo or the Rolls. Renzo rethinks his infatuation with Anna when she expresses no concern when they nearly run over a child, and end up crashing the Rolls-Royce.\n\nShe is infuriated by the damage to her Rolls-Royce, and ends up getting another passing driver to take her home, leaving Renzo on the road.\n\n===Mara of Rome===\nMara ([[Sophia Loren]]) works as a prostitute from her apartment, servicing a variety of high class clients including Augusto ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]), the wealthy, powerful and neurotic son of a [[Bologna]] industrialist.\n\nMara's elderly neighbor's grandson Umberto (Gianni Ridolfi) is a handsome and callow young man studying for the priesthood but not yet [[ordained]]. Umberto and Mara talk one night asking each other about their occupations. Embarrassed, Mara tells him she does manicures. Umberto's grandmother ([[Tina Pica]]) sees them talking and, knowing that Mara is a prostitute, interrupts their conversation telling Mara that she'll go to hell. Umberto protests, but Mara defends herself. Umberto falls in love with her. To the shrieking dismay of his grandmother, the young man wishes to leave his vocation to be with Mara, or to join the [[French Foreign Legion]], if Mara rejects him.  Mara vows to set the young man on the path of righteousness back to the [[seminary]] and vows celibacy for a week, if she succeeds. For this, she enlists the reluctant Augusto. Umberto finally agrees to return to the seminary. Mara rewards Augusto with a [[striptease]] (with Loren coached by Jacques Ruet choreographer of [[Le Crazy Horse de Paris]]<ref>https://www.vogue.fr/fashion-culture/article/sophia-loren-striptease-secrets-film-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow</ref>), but remembering her vow, refuses to go to bed with him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Adelina Sbaratti / Anna Molteni / Mara\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Carmine Sbaratti / Renzo / Augusto Rusconi\n* [[Aldo Giuffr\u00e8]] as Pasquale Nardella (segment \"Adelina\")\n* [[Agostino Salvietti]] as Dr. Verace (segment \"Adelina\")\n* Lino Mattera as Amedeo Scapece (segment \"Adelina\")\n* [[Tecla Scarano]] as Verace's sister (segment \"Adelina\")\n* Silvia Monelli as Elivira Nardella (segment \"Adelina\")\n* [[Carlo Croccolo]] as Auctioneer (segment \"Adelina\")\n* Pasquale Cennamo as Chief Police (segment \"Adelina\")\n* Tonino Cianci as (segment \"Adelina\") (as Antonio Cianci)\n* [[Armando Trovajoli]] as Giorgio Ferrario (segment \"Anna\")\n* [[Tina Pica]] as Grandmother Ferrario (segment \"Mara\")\n* Gianni Ridolfi as Umberto (segment \"Mara\") (as Giovanni Ridolfi)\n* Gennaro Di Gregorio as Grandfather (segment \"Mara\")\n\n==Reception==\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of [[The New Leader]] described Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow as an 'overrated dud'.<ref>{{cite book |title=Private Screenings|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1967 |page=154}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* 1965 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]<ref name=\"Oscars1965\" />\n* 1965 [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Foreign Actor \u2013 Marcello Mastroianni\n* 1964 [[Golden Globes]] \u2013 Samuel Goldwyn Award - nomination\n* 1964 David di Donatello Awards \u2013 David for Best Production \u2013 Carlo Ponti\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 37th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0057171|Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow}}\n*{{Tcmdb title|96418|Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow}}\n*{{Allmovie title|55789|Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow}}\n\n{{Vittorio De Sica}}\n{{AcademyAwardBestForeignLanguageFilm 1961\u20131980}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yesterday Today And Tomorrow}}\n[[Category:1963 films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian anthology films]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Italian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Alberto Moravia]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vittorio De Sica]]\n[[Category:Films set in Milan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Naples]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Cesare Zavattini]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Carlo Ponti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Armando Trovajoli]]\n[[Category:1963 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
