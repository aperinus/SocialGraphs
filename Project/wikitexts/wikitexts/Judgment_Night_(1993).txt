The four friends are alarmed when they accidentally hit a man named Teddy.\n\nA long argument ensues regarding contacting the police, which Ray, who had been driving the RV when it hit Teddy, does not want to happen due to the fact the friends had been drinking during their journey. Frank makes the decision to exit the RV to help the victim.\n\nInspecting Teddy, they find that he has been shot and has a paper bag filled with money. The injured young man is brought into the RV so the friends can get him to a hospital.\n\nThe RV is sideswiped by a car, leaving it lodged in a narrow alleyway. Three dangerous men \u2014 Sykes, Rhodes and Travis \u2014 force their way into the window at the back of the RV and drag Teddy outside. Fallon, a local crime lord, arrives and executes Teddy for stealing the money, the execution witnessed by Frank and his brother and friends. Fallon then sets his sights to kill the four witnesses.\n\nThe friends are chased by Fallon's men into a rail yard. They hide in an old streetcar in which several homeless people are sheltering. They blackmail the four men into handing over their valuables but are heard by the pursuing gang members. The four friends and homeless people from multiple train cars flee. Fallon shoots and kills one of the homeless people, mistaking them for his quarry.\n\nTaking refuge in an apartment building, the four friends convince a resident to call the police but Fallon and his men arrive at the complex, going door to door terrorizing the occupants to hand over the four friends if they were inside.\n\nThe resident demands the four friends to leave immediately as their presence in her home is putting her and her baby as well as her roommates lives in grave danger. The roommate takes some pity and tells the four friends that there is an escape route to another building via the roof.\n\nThe friends use a ladder to cross over an alley onto the other rooftop but are pursued by Fallon and his men. Ray stays behind and tries to bribe the drug gang into letting them go. Fallon, disgusted by Ray's tactics and privileged upbringing, throws Ray from the roof, killing him.\n \nThe trio are chased into the sewers by Fallon and his henchmen. Mike shoots and kills Sykes, allowing them to escape. Discovering Sykes' body, a comment made by Travis annoys Fallon and he drowns Travis.\n\nThe trio then break into a [[Flea market|swap meet]], hoping to summon the police by setting off the building's alarm and are arrested by two security guards. Fallon and Rhodes arrive and kill the guards as the trio hide in the store. Rhodes and Mike engage in a shootout that kills Rhodes but leaves Mike wounded. John retrieves Mike, but Fallon shoots John in the leg. The three friends make their way to a bathroom where Frank tends to their wounds. Frank leaves to try to get help but spots Fallon, who is about to discover John and Mike.\n\nFrank shouts out, causing Fallon to search for him. A fight ensues where Frank ultimately overpowers Fallon and throws him off a ledge to his death.\n\nPolice and paramedics arrive, taking Mike and John to a hospital where they are expected to survive their wounds. Frank then exits the building to his waiting wife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Frank Wyatt, a family man going with his brother and his two friends to the boxing match\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Mike Peterson, Frank's best friend who goes to the boxing match\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Fallon, the drug lord who pursues the four friends after they see him kill a thieving henchman\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as John Wyatt, Frank's younger brother, who is invited by Frank to the boxing match after Frank's third friend drops out.\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Ray Cochran, A friend who rents an RV to take his friends to a boxing match\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Sykes, Fallon's second-in-command\n* [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] (credited as Erik Schrody) as Rhodes, one of Fallon's minions\n* [[Michael Wiseman]] as Travis, one of Fallon's minions\n* [[Michael DeLorenzo]] as Teddy, Fallon's lieutenant who is executed for stealing from him, right in front of Frank, Mike, John, and Ray, thus beginning the chase\n* [[Christine Harnos]] as Linda Wyatt, Frank's wife and John's sister-in-law, she reluctantly agrees to let Frank go to the boxing match\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Kevin Jarre]] had written the first spec script for the movie (Under its original title, \"Escape\") sometime around 1989 or earlier, which was based on a story idea by [[Richard DiLello]], and producer [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]], who produced films like ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987) and ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), bought it in January 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-18-ca-423-story.html?_amp=true|title=Threads That Led to the Making of 'Glory' : Movies: Screenwriter Kevin Jarre recalls the 'unbelievable odyssey' in getting the tale of a black Civil War regiment made|date=1990-01-18|newspaper= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/the-best-movie-you-never-saw-judgment-night/amp|title=The Best Movie You Never Saw: Judgment Night|website=www.joblo.com|date=2019-08-02|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> At the 25th anniversary screening of the film during Cinepocalypse film festival in Chicago, director [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]] confirmed in a Q&A about how Jarre's script, which was a lot darker and more violent, went through different writers, including [[John Carpenter]], [[William Wisher Jr.|William Wisher]], and [[Christopher Crowe (screenwriter)|Christopher Crowe]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3506113/john-carpenter-wrote-script-judgment-night/|title=John Carpenter Wrote a Script for 'Judgment Night'|date=2018-06-25|website=www.bloody-disgusting.com|access-date=2020-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.copyrightencyclopedia.com/judgment-night-by-cayuga-productions-inc-peter-sellers/|title=Judgment night|website=www.copyrightencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-09-22}}</ref> and many different versions, which involved bikers in the desert outside L.A., and rooftop motorcycle chases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/06/stephen-hopkins-judgment-night-interview/amp/|title=Stephen Hopkins on Judgment Night, Urban Hellscapes, and '90s Chicago|website=www.consequenceofsound.net|date=2018-06-23|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> The original script was entirely re-written to the point where only [[Lewis Colick]], one of the writers who worked on re-writes, got the final screenplay credit (Colick shares story credit with novelist Jere Cunningham).\n\nAccording to Hopkins, he wanted [[John Travolta]] in the lead role and [[Kevin Spacey]] in the main villain role; other actors, including [[Ray Liotta]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Samuel L.
