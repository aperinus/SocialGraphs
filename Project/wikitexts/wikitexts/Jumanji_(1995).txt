Loosely based on [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s [[Jumanji (picture book)|picture book of the same name]], the film is the first installment of the [[Jumanji (franchise)|''Jumanji'' franchise]].  It stars [[Robin Williams]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[David Alan Grier]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], and [[Bebe Neuwirth]].\n\nThe story centers on a supernatural board game that releases jungle-based hazards upon its players with every turn they take. As a boy in 1969, Alan Parrish became trapped inside the game itself while playing with his friend, Sarah Whittle. Twenty-six years later, siblings Judy and Peter Shepherd find the game, begin playing and then unwittingly release the now-adult Alan. After tracking down Sarah, the quartet resolves to finish the game in order to reverse all of the destruction it has caused.\n\nThe film was released on December 15, 1995, to mixed reviews, but was a box office success, grossing $263 million worldwide on a budget of approximately $65 million. It was the [[1995 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th highest-grossing film of 1995]].\n\nThe film spawned an [[Jumanji (TV series)|animated television series]], which aired from 1996 to 1999, and was followed by a related film, ''[[Zathura: A Space Adventure]]'' (2005),<!-- WARNING: Do not remove Zathura, as it is considered part of the franchise. Changes made without consensus will be reverted. --> and two indirect sequels, ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'' (2017) and ''[[Jumanji: The Next Level]]'' (2019), with [[Columbia Pictures]] taking over distribution for all subsequent films.<!-- The mid-credits scene of \"The Next Level\" teases yet another possible sequel, happening directly after the ending of that film, but this has not been confirmed to be happening yet. -->\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words.

One day, he escapes a group of bullies and retreats to Sam's shoe factory. He meets his friend, Carl Bentley, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a [[conveyor belt]], but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After the bullies attack Alan and steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds a [[board game]] called ''Jumanji'', which was buried 100 years earlier, and brings it home.\n\nThat night, after arguing with Sam about attending a [[boarding school]], Alan plans to run away, but his friend, Sarah Whittle, returns his bicycle. Alan shows her ''Jumanji'' and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the [[crystal ball]] at the center of the board. After Alan inadvertently rolls a five, a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a five or eight, and he is sucked into the game. Afterwards, a swarm of [[bat]]s appears and chases Sarah out of the mansion.\n\nTwenty-six years later, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the now-vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip in Canada the winter before. Discovering ''Jumanji'' in the attic, Judy and Peter begin playing it. Their rolls summon giant [[mosquito]]es and swarms of [[monkey]]s. The game rules state everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter next rolls a five which releases a [[lion]] and a grown up Alan. As Alan makes his way out, he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy, and Peter go to the now-abandoned shoe factory and learn that Sam abandoned the business to search for his son after his disappearance, until his 1991 death. Eventually, the factory closed, sending Brantford into economic decline.\n\nRealizing they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate Sarah, now haunted by both ''Jumanji'' and Alan's disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah's first move releases fast-growing carnivorous vines, and Alan's next move releases a big-game hunter named Van Pelt, whom Alan first met in the game\u2019s inner world. The next roll summons a stampede of various animals, and a [[pelican]] steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl. Back in town, the stampede wreaks havoc, and Van Pelt steals the game.\n\nPeter, Sarah, and Judy track Van Pelt to a [[department store]], where they set booby traps to subdue him and retrieve the game, while Alan, after revealing his identity to Carl, is set free. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. They release one calamity after another until Van Pelt arrives. When Alan drops the dice, he wins the game which causes everything that happened as a result of the game to be reversed.\n\nAlan and Sarah return to 1969, just in time for Alan to reconcile with Sam, who tells him that he does not have to attend boarding school. Alan also admits his responsibility for damaging the conveyor belt. After realizing that they have memories of the game, Alan and Sarah throw ''Jumanji'' into a river, then share a kiss.\n\nIn an alternate version of the present, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan's parents are still alive and Alan is now successfully running the family business. Alan and Sarah meet Judy, Peter, and their parents Jim and Martha for the first time during a Christmas party. Alan offers Jim a job and convinces them to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, two young girls hear drumbeats while walking on a beach. ''Jumanji'' is seen lying partially buried in the sand.<!--Please do not add a location or nationality for the girls without providing a reliable source.-->\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast list as shown in the order as after cut-to-black at end of film. -->\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Alan Parrish\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Judy Shepherd\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Carl \"The Sole-man\" Bentley\n* [[Adam Hann-Byrd]] as young Alan Parrish\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Sarah Whittle\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as Sam Parris\n** Hyde also portrays Van Pelt, a big-game hunter who resides in ''Jumanji''.\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Nora Shepherd\n* [[Bradley Pierce]] as Peter Shepherd\n* [[James Handy]] as the Exterminator\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Carol Parrish\n* [[Laura Bell Bundy]] as young Sarah Whittle\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}\nWhile [[Peter Guber]] was visiting [[Boston]], he invited author [[Chris Van Allsburg]], who lives in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] his book.

He specifically cited Peter's [[monkey]] transformation as making him \"look like a Wolf Man{{nbsp}}... with a hairy snout and wicked jaws\" that were likely to scare children.
