The film was directed by [[Dan Mazer]] and written by John Phillips. It stars [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Zac Efron]] with [[Aubrey Plaza]] and [[Zoey Deutch]] in supporting roles.\n\nFilming began on January 19, 2015, in [[Atlanta]] and ended on May 9. ''Dirty Grandpa'' was theatrically released on January 22, 2016, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. It grossed $105.2 million against a production budget of $25 million, but it was universally lambasted by critics, several of which calling it the [[List of films considered the worst#Dirty Grandpa (2016)|worst film they had ever seen]].\n\n==Plot==\nJason Kelly is a [[corporate lawyer]] in [[Atlanta]] who works for his father's [[law firm]]. Jason's grandmother dies, and after the funeral, his [[U.S. Army]] veteran grandfather, [[Lt. Colonel]] Richard \"Dick\" Kelly, asks Jason to drive him to [[Boca Raton, Florida]], due to his driver\u2019s license being suspended. Jason is marrying his controlling fianc\u00e9e, Meredith, in one week, but decides to take his grandfather despite his apprehension.\n\nAt a diner they meet Jason's old photography classmate, Shadia, along with her friends Lenore and Bradley. After learning that Lenore wants to have sex with a college professor, Dick tells them that he is a university professor and that Jason is a photographer for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. They initially go their separate ways, but Dick convinces Jason that they should meet the girls at [[Daytona Beach]] because Dick wants to have sex with Lenore. The two go to a golf course, where Dick flirts with two women much to Jason's annoyance.\n\nAt Daytona, they meet up with the girls and their friends, Cody and Brah, with whom they compete in beer chugging. Dick secretly slips [[Xanax]] into Jason's beer. That night, a drunk Jason, wearing nothing but a [[hornet]] fanny pack, parties and accidentally smokes [[crack cocaine]] from a drug dealer named Pam. He steals a motorcycle and wakes up the next day on the beach. During an awkward [[FaceTime]] session with Meredith and his family, a toddler grabs the fanny pack and takes it off; the boy's father calls the police who promptly arrest Jason. Dick bails him out, and Jason attempts to leave Dick with his old Army friend Stinky in a [[nursing home]] but they learn he is dying. Dick persuades Jason to stay in Daytona until he is able to sleep with Lenore.\n\nThey enter into a muscle flexing contest with Cody and Brah; but Jason quits out of fear of being photographed. Dick alters a T-shirt cannon to fire a beer at Cody and Brah, hospitalizing them. After Dick reveals to Jason that he was a [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Green Beret]], the two go to a [[nightclub]] with the girls. Dick gets into a fight with some men after they bully Bradley for his [[homosexuality]]. The next day, Jason bonds with Shadia and she tells him that she is going to live on a ship for a year. That night, the group does [[karaoke]] with the men from the night before. After singing a duet, Jason realizes he has feelings for Shadia and plans on telling her the truth, but before he can, Cody does an online search using information he saw on Dick's (still valid) driver's license, and tells Shadia that Jason is already engaged. Jason then gets caught with drugs which were planted by Cody and Brah, and is thrown into jail again. The next day, Dick bails him out and tells Jason that his real reason for the trip was to convince Jason not to go through with the wedding. A disgusted and furious Jason leaves Dick and drives back home.\n\nDuring his wedding rehearsal, Dick hacks into the computer system, revealing embarrassing photos of Jason. Jason says that he cannot marry Meredith, who reveals that she had an affair with his cousin, though Jason does not hear this information due to poor acoustics; his cousin instead quickly telling him that Meredith has told him to do what he wants to do. He, Dick, and Pam, with David (Dick's son and Jason's father), use Pam's [[ice cream truck]] to catch up with the bus that Shadia is on as she is leaving. Jason and Shadia kiss, and he gets on the bus with her, while David and Dick, previously estranged, reconnect. Dick goes to his house in Boca Raton and finds Lenore there waiting for him, and they have sex. Dick and Lenore get married and have a baby boy named Richard Jr., and Jason and Shadia are named the godparents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Lieutenant Colonel Richard \"Dick\" Kelly, Jason's grandfather and David's father<ref name=\"Deutch\" />\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Jason Kelly, David's son and Dick's grandson<ref name=\"Deutch\" />\n* [[Zoey Deutch]] as Shadia, Jason's old photography classmate, Lenore's best friend and one of Bradley's two friends<ref name=\"Deutch\" />\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Lenore, Shadia's best friend and one of Bradley's two friends<ref name=\"Plaza\" />\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Meredith Goldstein, Jason's domineering fianc\u00e9e<ref name=trailer />\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as David Kelly, Jason's father and Dick's son<ref name=\"Plaza\" /><ref name=trailer />\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Pam\n* [[Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman]] as Bradley, Shadia and Lenore's effeminate, gay male friend\n* [[Jake Picking]] as Cody\n* Michael Hudson as Brah\n* [[Adam Pally]] as Nick<ref name=\"PallyCast\" />\n* [[Henry Zebrowski]] as Officer Gary Reiter\n* [[Mo Collins]] as Officer Jean Finch\n* [[Danny Glover]] as \"Stinky\", Dick's old army friend\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Tyrone\n* [[Eugenia Kuzmina]] as Hippie Cathy, appears briefly in the background of one scene.
