Before its release, it had three other working titles: ''The Beardsley Story'', ''Full House'', and ''His, Hers, and Theirs''.\n\nIt was based loosely on the story of Frank and [[Helen Beardsley]], although [[Desilu Productions]] bought the rights to the story long before Helen's [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] book ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' was released to bookstores. Screenwriters [[Madelyn Pugh]] and [[Bob Carroll (TV writer)|Bob Carroll]] wrote several ''[[I Love Lucy]]''-style stunts that in most cases had no basis in the actual lives of the Beardsley family, before [[Melville Shavelson]] and Mort Lachman took over primary writing duties. The film was commercially successful, and even the Beardsleys themselves appreciated it.\n\n== Plot ==\nFrank Beardsley is a [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Warrant officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]], recently detached from the aircraft carrier [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] and assigned as project officer for the [[Fresnel lens]] glide-slope indicator, or \"meatball,\" that would eventually become standard equipment on all carriers. Helen North is a civilian [[nurse]] working in the [[dispensary]] at [[NAS Alameda]], the [[California]] U.S. Navy base to which Frank is assigned.\n\nFrank meets Helen, first by chance in the [[Commissary (store)|commissary]] on the base and again when Frank brings his distraught teen-age daughter for treatment at the dispensary, where Helen informs him that the young lady is simply growing up in a too-crowded house that lacks a mother's guidance. They immediately hit it off and go on a date, all the while shying away from admitting their respective secrets: Frank has ten children and Helen has eight, from previous marriages ended by their spouses' deaths.\n\nWhen each finally learns the other's secret, they initially resist their mutual attraction. But Chief Warrant Officer Darrell Harrison ([[Van Johnson]]) is determined to bring them together, so he \"fixes up\" each of them with a sure-to-be-incompatible  [[wikt:blind date|blind date]]. Helen's date is an [[obstetrician]] ([[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]]) who stands a good head shorter than she (\"Darrell had a malicious sense of humor,\" Helen observes in voice-over); Frank's date is a \"hip\" girl ([[Louise Troy]]) who is not only young enough to be his daughter, but is also far too forward for his taste. As the final touch, Harrison makes sure that both dates take place in the same Japanese restaurant. As Harrison fully expects, Frank and Helen end up leaving the restaurant together in his car, with Frank's date sitting uncomfortably between them as they carry on about their children.\n\nFrank and Helen continue to date regularly, and eventually he invites her to dinner in his home. This nearly turns disastrous when Mike, Rusty, and Greg ([[Tim Matheson]], [[Gil Rogers]], and [[Gary Goetzman]]), Frank's three sons, mix hefty doses of gin, scotch, and vodka into Helen's drink. As a result, Helen's behavior turns wild and embarrassing, which Frank cannot comprehend until he catches his sons trying to conceal their laughter. \"The court of inquiry is now in session!\" he declares, and gets the three to own up and apologize. After this, he announces his intention to marry Helen, adding, \"And nobody put anything into my drink.\"\n\nMost of the children oppose the union at first, regarding each other and their respective stepparents with suspicion. Eventually, however, the 18 children bond into one large [[stepfamily|blended family]], about to increase\u2014Helen becomes pregnant.\n\nFurther tension develops between young Philip North and his teacher at the [[parochial school]] that he attends: his teacher insists that he use his \"legal\" name, which remains North even after his mother marries Beardsley. This prompts Helen and Frank to discuss cross-adopting each other's children, who (except for Philip) are aghast at the notion of \"reburying\" their deceased biological parents. The subsequent birth of Joseph John Beardsley finally unites the children, who agree unanimously to [[adoption]] under a common surname.\n\nThe film ends with the eldest sibling, Mike Beardsley, going off to [[Camp Pendleton]] to begin his stint in the [[United States Marine Corps]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as CWO Frank Beardsley, USN\n* [[Lucille Ball]] as [[Helen Beardsley]]\n* [[Van Johnson]] as CWO Darrell Harrison, USN\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Howard Beardsley (Frank's brother.)\n* Nancy Howard as Nancy Beardsley (Frank's sister-in-law)\n* [[Sidney Miller (actor)|Sidney Miller]] as Dr. Ashford (Helen's date)\n* [[Louise Troy]] as Madeleine Love (Frank's date)\n* [[Tom Bosley]] as a family doctor who makes a house call on the Beardsleys, and is also the consulting physician for the [[California]] [[Selective Service System|Draft Board]] when Mike Beardsley reports for a required physical exam.\n* [[Ben Murphy]] as Larry, Colleen's boyfriend\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Jennifer Gan]] as Young Lady In Coffeehouse\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Supermarket Clerk\n* Mary Gregory as Sister Mary Alice, who questions Philip's use of the Beardsley name\n* Harry Holcombe as the judge who handles the grand mutual adoption\n* [[Ysabel MacCloskey]] as Nanny #1, who lasts less than a day.\n*Pauline Hague as Nanny #2, aka \"Mrs. Anderson.\" She lasts a week because she is hiding from the police.

The names of Frank and Helen Beardsley and their children are real; the wedding invitation that appears midway through the film is the actual North-Beardsley wedding invitation. The career of [[Lieutenant]] Richard North USN is also described accurately, but briefly: specifically, he was a navigator on the crew of an [[A-3 Skywarrior]] that crashed in a routine training flight, killing all aboard, exactly as Helen describes in the film.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Yours, Mine, and Ours\u2026\" - The origin of the original blended American family |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/USN-138970-Whidbey.htm |website=Check-Six.com}}</ref> Frank Beardsley is described correctly as a Navy warrant officer. The \"loan-out\" of the two youngest Beardsleys is also real, and indeed Michael, Charles (\"Rusty\"), and Gregory Beardsley were determined to see their father marry Helen North as a means of rectifying this situation. The movie correctly describes Frank Beardsley as applying his Navy mind-set to the daunting task of organizing such a large family (although the chart with the color-coded bathrooms and letter-coded bedrooms--\"I'm Eleven Red A!\"\u2014is likely a [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] exaggeration). Finally, Michael Beardsley did indeed serve a term in the Marine Corps, as did Rusty.\n\nThe differences from what Helen Beardsley's book ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' puts forth include the following:<ref>Helen Beardsley, ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'', New York: Random House, 1965, 215 pp.</ref>\n\n* The film changes the ages and birth order of many of the children, and places some of the children, most notably Colleen and Philip North, into situations not mentioned in the book. For example, Colleen North is not mentioned in Beardsley's book as ever having a boyfriend who took inappropriate liberties with her.\n* Contrary to the depiction in the film, Helen North and Frank Beardsley began their relationship by corresponding with each other in sympathy for their recent losses. Furthermore, each knew how many children the other had before their first meeting, which was ''not'' by accident in a Navy commissary; Frank's sister told Helen about Frank's situation and she wrote to him to offer her sympathy. On their first date, Helen made no attempt to hide her children from Frank.\n* Frank Beardsley was a [[Yeoman (United States Navy)|yeoman]] in the Navy and afterward the personnel officer at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]]. He played no role in the development of the \"meatball\", nor is he listed as having served aboard any ship named USS ''Enterprise''.\n* Frank's friend \"CWO Darrell Harrison USN\", the character (portrayed by Van Johnson) who draws Frank and Helen together, was invented for the film. Helen Beardsley writes in ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' that her own sister and brother-in-law played this role.\n* Frank Beardsley never told his own story in print, and Helen provides very little description of his homelife before he married her; there is no mention of Frank's home not being exactly \"[[shipshape]]\", or his not being able to keep a housekeeper longer than a week.\n* The couple who temporarily took care of Germaine and Joan Beardsley were not Frank's brother and sister-in-law as depicted in the film, but two unrelated friends of his.\n* The North and Beardsley children received the prospect of Helen and Frank's marriage with enthusiasm and without reservation. When Helen visited Frank's home for the first time, she took her five oldest children along. They met some of their Beardsley counterparts and immediately became friends. From the moment that the prospect of Frank and Helen's marriage became real, the children all began regarding Frank and Helen as their parents and even pressured them to marry as soon as possible.\n* The \"drunken dinner scene\" in which Mike, Rusty, and Greg Beardsley serve Helen North a double (or perhaps triple) [[Screwdriver (cocktail)|screwdriver]] with [[Scotch whiskey|Scotch]] and [[gin]] makes no appearance in the book. Rather, it takes advantage of Lucille Ball\u2019s facility in playing drunk as in the \"[[Lucy Does a TV Commercial]]\" episode in Lucille Ball's television show ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which she rehearses a television commercial for a vitamin elixir (Vitameatavegamin) with a high alcohol content. Two ''I Love Lucy'' writers who wrote that episode--[[Madelyn Pugh|Madelyn Davis]] and [[Bob Carroll (TV writer)|Bob Carroll]]\u2014are given story credit in the film. \n* Mike, Rusty, and Greg observed \"company manners\" from the beginning of Helen's first visit to the Beardsley home. Helen describes their gestures as touching her greatly. The film does not depict this.\n* The blended family did not move into a new home as shown in the film. Instead, Frank Beardsley had bedrooms and bathrooms added to his existing home, and Helen North sold her house when she and her children moved into his. (The leaking-roof scene is based on the incident that prompted Helen North to move to California from [[Whidbey Island]].)\n* The North boy who was determined to be bad because \"the good die young\" was actually Nicholas North, not Philip. It was also Nicholas whose teachers commanded him to use the North name after his mother's marriage although he preferred the Beardsley name. (However, the ruckus in the film\u2014that a schoolteacher incites in her classroom over the naming issue\u2014is also a dramatization.)\n* Philip's idolization of Mike, and Mike's willingness to be a role model to Philip, are touched on in the book. However, all of Frank Beardsley's three eldest sons actually played this role. Likewise, all of Helen North's sons, not Philip alone, lionized Mike, as well as Rusty and Greg. The high mutual respect that the stepbrothers developed for one another was one of the most important developments that knit the blended family together. (In this regard, the petty jealousies between Frank's and Helen's children, as depicted in the film, are generally dramatic liberties.)\n* The one incident of mutual jealousy that did develop in real life\u2014between the eldest Beardsley and North daughters\u2014is not depicted in the film.\n* The children never objected to the massive cross-adoption. The chief objectors fell into two groups: Richard North's brother and some of his other relatives, who objected to the \"erasure\" of Mr. North's name; and a large number of readers of a major magazine (which Helen Beardsley never named) who objected in principle to the adoption when that magazine mistakenly reported it as an accomplished fact. However, Frank and Helen ultimately ignored those objections in the face of more pressing and important consequences of their having married ''without'' initially adopting each other's children.\n\nThe film also takes dramatic liberties with its depiction of Navy life and flight operations aboard an aircraft carrier:\n\n* When Frank learns that Helen is pregnant (with Joseph John), he asks the catapult launch officer to stop the launch of the mail plane to permit him to board it; in reality, this officer does not have that authority. In fact, the Air Boss is the lowest-ranking officer who can stop the launch of an aircraft, and normally he does not keep station on the flight deck at all.\n* Frank is seen wearing a ship's ballcap, and then a combination cap. Neither would be permitted, as they constitute a [[foreign object damage]] hazard. Additionally, no one would be permitted on the flight deck during active flight operations without wearing helmet, goggles, and ear plugs.\n\nAs much as this film departed from the Beardsleys' actual life, the 2005 [[Yours, Mine and Ours (2005 film)|remake]] departed even more significantly.\n\n== Production notes ==\n[[Henry Fonda]] and [[Lucille Ball]] take turns providing voice-over narration throughout\u2014and in at least one scene, [[Van Johnson]]  [[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|talks directly to the camera]], as does Fonda.\n\nThat [[Lucille Ball]] would portray Helen Beardsley was never in doubt. But a long line of distinguished actors came under consideration, at one time or another, for the role of Frank Beardsley. They included [[Desi Arnaz]], [[James Stewart]], [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Art Carney]], and [[John Wayne]]. [[Henry Fonda]] finally accepted, and indeed asked for, the role in a telephone conversation with Robert F. Blumofe in 1967. Ball, who had worked with Fonda before in the 1942 release ''[[The Big Street]]'', readily agreed to the casting.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027184443/http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/6066/yoursmineandours.html  Yours, Mine and Ours] on GeoCities.</ref>\n\nOne account{{which|date=October 2013}} says that Ball recalled in 1961 that [[Desilu Productions]] first bought the rights to the Beardsley-North story in 1959, even ''before'' Helen Beardsley published her biography, but this is highly unlikely because Frank and Helen Beardsley married on September 6, 1961, and their first spouses were both alive in 1959. More likely is the story that [[Bob Carroll (TV writer)|Bob Carroll]] and his wife brought the story of the Beardsley family to Ball's attention after reading it in a local newspaper.<ref>[http://www.lucyfan.com/yoursmineours.html Yours, Mine and Ours] at LucyFan.com</ref> However, Mr. Carroll is said to recall his wife mentioning the story in 1960\u2014again, a full year before the Beardsleys were married and probably when Dick North was still alive. In any event, Desilu Productions did secure the rights early on, and Mr. Carroll and [[Madelyn Pugh]] began instantly to write a script.\n\nProduction suffered multiple interruptions for several reasons. It began in December 1962 after Ball's abortive attempt at a career on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. In 1963, production was halted after the box-office failure of her comedy effort ''[[Critic's Choice (1963 film)|Critic's Choice]]'' (with [[Bob Hope]]). Later, she was unhappy with the script presented by Madelyn Pugh (then known as Madelyn Pugh Martin) and Bob Carroll, precisely because their script overly resembled an ''I Love Lucy'' television episode, and commissioned another writer ([[Leonard Spigelgass]]) to rewrite the script.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Mr. Spigelgass does not seem to have succeeded in breaking free of Lucy's television work, so producer Robert Blumofe hired yet two more writers (Mickey Rudin and Bernie Weitzman) to make an attempt.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} When this failed, Blumofe hired [[Melville Shavelson]], who eventually directed. All further rewrite efforts came to an abrupt end at the insistence of [[United Artists]], the film's eventual distributor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAt this point in the production cycle, [[Helen Beardsley]]'s book ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' was actually released in 1965. Like many film adaptations, exactly how much the book informed the final shooting script is impossible to determine.\n\nProduction began in 1967 with [[Henry Fonda]] definitely signed on to portray Frank. Mort Lachman, who had been one of [[Bob Hope]]'s writers, joined the writing team at the recommendation of Shavelson.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Leonard Spigelgass received no on-screen writing credit for his efforts in this film.\n\nFilming was done largely on-location in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] and [[San Francisco, California]] with Mike's high-school graduation being filmed at [[Grant High School (Los Angeles, California)|Grant High School]] in southern California (Frank Beardsley's home, into which the blended family eventually moved, was in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]]). The total budget is estimated at $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|1968|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} including $1,700,000 for actual filming and post-production.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received lukewarm critical reviews\u2014although [[Leonard Maltin]]{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} looked favorably upon it as a \"wholesome, 'family' picture\" with an excellent script. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised the performances of Ball and Fonda.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/yours-mine-and-ours-1968 |title = Yours, Mine and Ours movie review |date=1968 |author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\nIt was a massive commercial success, earning nearly $26 million ($182 Million adjusted for inflation) at the box office (on a tight budget of $2.5 million) and earning over $11 million in rentals.<ref>\"Big Rental Films of 1968\", ''Variety'', 8 January 1969 p 15. Please note this figure is a rental accruing to distributors.</ref> It was the top-grossing film released by United Artists in 1968. This came about probably on the strength of Lucille Ball's name and performance (which many of her fans regard as a classic).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some critics felt that Ball, then in her late 50s, was perhaps 15 years too old for the part of a middle-aged (presumably 40-ish) mother.\n\nFrank Beardsley commented that his family enjoyed the film as general entertainment, and acknowledged that perhaps the scriptwriters felt that their screenplay was \"a better story\" than the truth.<ref>Fred Sorri, \"Famous Carmel Family Operating Nut House,\" ''Monterey Peninsula Herald,'' April 1, 1968.</ref>\n\nNot anticipating the huge box office returns from the movie, Lucille Ball failed to make appropriate [[tax shelter]] and thus saw most of her share going to pay taxes.\n\nThe film's success partly inspired network approval of the television series ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''; the original script for the series pilot was written well before this movie became a reality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nAmong the child actors cast as the Beardsley and North children, several went on to greater success, including [[Tim Matheson]] (billed here as Tim Matthieson) who went on to play the character Otter in the more adult-oriented comedy ''[[Animal House]]''; [[Morgan Brittany]] (billed here as Suzanne Cupito) played [[Katherine Wentworth]] in ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' from 1981 to 1987; [[Mitch Vogel]] appeared in ''[[The Reivers]]'' with [[Steve McQueen]] for which Vogel received a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1970; and [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], daughter of actor/musician [[Ricky Nelson]], who eventually starred in the series ''[[Father Dowling Mysteries]]'' beside [[Tom Bosley]], who portrayed the doctor in this movie. Also, Matheson (Mike Beardsley) and future soap-opera actress [[Jennifer Leak]] (Colleen North) married in real life in 1968, although they divorced in 1971.\n\nThe film holds a 50% approval rating with 12 reviews from critics on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1024407_yours_mine_and_ours |title=Yours, Mine and Ours |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Yours, Mine and Ours'' was released on [[VHS]] by [[MGM/UA Home Video]] in 1989, 1994, and 1998. A [[Laserdisc]] version was released in 1994, featuring noise reduction applied to the film soundtrack.\n\nIt was released to [[DVD]] on March 6, 2001. While the DVD was released in [[full frame (cinematography)|full frame]], the original film was a [[widescreen]] release in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio; this, therefore, constitutes an [[open matte]] presentation.\n\nIt was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 13, 2016 through Olive Films (under license from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment|MGM]] and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]).
