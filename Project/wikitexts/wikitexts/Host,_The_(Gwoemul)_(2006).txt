The film concerns a monster kidnapping a man's daughter, and his attempts to rescue her. According to the director, his inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yang|first=Seung-cheol|title=That river creature is his baby: Meet the maker of ''Host''|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2751906|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|access-date=2013-09-05|date=16 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the director's work ''[[Memories of Murder]]'', ''The Host'' was highly anticipated.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRESS SCREENING: \uad34\ubb3c (The Host)|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2006/07/press-screening-the-host.html|work=[[Twitch Film]]|access-date=2013-09-05|date=7 July 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104345/http://twitchfilm.com/2006/07/press-screening-the-host.html|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref> It was released on a record number of screens in its home country on July 27, 2006. By the end of its run on November 8, 13 million tickets had been sold, making it (at the time) the [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|highest-grossing South Korean film of all time]]. The film was released on a limited basis in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] formats on July 24, 2007. It won several awards including Best Film at the [[Asian Film Awards]] and at the [[Blue Dragon Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2000, an [[United States Forces Korea|American military]] [[pathologist]] orders his Korean assistant to dump 200 bottles of [[formaldehyde]] down a drain leading into the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Over the next several years, there are [[sightings]] of a strange [[Amphibian|amphibious]] creature in the [[waterway]], and the [[fish]] in the river die off.\n\nIn 2006, a slow-witted man named Park Gang-du runs a small [[snack bar]] in a park near the river with his father, Hee-bong. Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo; his sister Nam-joo, a national medalist [[archery|archer]]; and his brother, Nam-il, an [[alcoholic]] [[college graduate]] and former [[political activist]].\n\nA huge creature emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people. Gang-du tries to grab his daughter from the crowd and run, but he realizes he has grabbed the wrong person's hand and sees the creature snatching away Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and [[quarantine]] people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is the host of a deadly, unknown [[virus]].\n\nGang-du receives a phone call from Hyun-seo. She explains that she is trapped in the [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]]s with the creature, but her phone stops working. Gang-du and his family escape the hospital and purchase supplies from [[gangsters]] in order to search for Hyun-seo. Two homeless boys, Se-jin and Se-joo, after raiding Hee-bong's snack bar for food, are attacked and swallowed by the creature. It returns to its sleeping area in the sewer and [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] them, but only Se-joo is alive. Hyun-seo helps Se-joo hide inside a drain pipe where the creature cannot reach them.\n\nThe Parks encounter the creature and shoot at it until they run out of [[ammunition]]. The creature kills Hee-bong due to Gang-du miscalculating the remaining shells in his shotgun when he gives it to Hee-bong. Gang-du is captured by the Army and Nam-il and Nam-joo become separated from each other. Nam-il meets an old friend, Fat Guevara, at an office building to ask for help and learns the government has placed a bounty on his family. Unbeknownst to Nam-il, Fat Guevara has contacted the government so he can claim the bounty, but Nam-il is able to escape after obtaining Hyun-seo's location. Gang-du overhears an American scientist say that there is no virus; it was made up to distract people from the creature's origin. They decided to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] Gang-du to silence him.\n\nWhen she thinks the creature is sleeping, Hyun-seo tries to escape from its lair using a rope she has made from old clothes. The creature awakes and swallows Hyun-seo and Se-joo. Gang-du succeeds in escaping from where he is being held by taking a nurse hostage. Nam-il meets a homeless man who helps him. The government announces a plan to release a toxic chemical called [[Agent Yellow]] into the river to attempt to kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature and sees Hyun-seo's arm dangling out of its mouth. He chases it to the location where Agent Yellow is to be released, coming across Nam-joo along the way. The creature attacks the large crowd that has assembled to [[protest]] the chemical dump. Agent Yellow is released, which stuns the creature. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth, but she is dead, though she is still clutching Se-joo, who is unconscious, but alive. Gang-du, enraged at his daughter's death, attacks the creature, aided by Nam-il, Nam-joo, and the homeless man. They set it on fire and Gang-du [[Impalement|impales]] it with a pole, finally killing it. As they mourn for Hyun-seo, Gang-du revives Se-joo.\n\nSome time later, it is seen that Gang-du has [[Inheritance|inherited]] his father's snack bar and [[adopted]] Se-joo. While watching the river, he hears a noise and picks up a double-barrel [[shotgun]] to investigate, but finds nothing. He and Se-joo have a meal together, ignoring a [[news broadcast]] stating that the aftermath of the incident was due to [[misinformation]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Park Gang-du, a clumsy misfit vendor in his father's shop, who often falls asleep. He is often berated by his family members, and his laziness was caused by lack of protein as a child. \n* [[Byun Hee-bong]] as Park Hee-bong, the father of Gang-du, Nam-il, Nam-joo, and grandfather of Hyun-Seo.

Following the positive reaction to the director's debut, ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]'', coupled with the critical acclaim and box-office success of his previous work, ''[[Memories of Murder]]'', the film was given a generous production budget of around {{SK won|10 billion}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://twitchfilm.com/2006/07/k-film-spotlight-bong-joon-ho-talks-the-host.html| title=Bong Joon-Ho Talks \uad34\ubb3c (The Host)| work=[[Twitch Film]]| date=26 July 2006| access-date=2007-01-12| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929100605/http://twitchfilm.com/2006/07/k-film-spotlight-bong-joon-ho-talks-the-host.html| archive-date=29 September 2012| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> (just over {{USD|10 million}}), huge by local industry standards.<ref name=\"koreanfilm\">[http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm06.html#thehost \"The Host\"].

The stars and crew were inoculated against [[tetanus]] by the medical officer. During filming, the crew had to deal with the effects of changes in weather and ambient temperature. This including the sewage water freezing in cold temperatures, so that it had to be broken up and melted; and during hot and windy periods, the water evaporated and the silt turned to dust, which blew around in the breeze and into the faces of the crew.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Host DVD (additional features) | medium = DVD | publisher = Optimum Home Entertainment | date = 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nThe director had to work around the budget-imposed restrictions, especially when it came to special effects. The creature was designed by Chin Wei-chen, the modeling was done by [[New Zealand]]-based [[Weta Workshop]] and the [[animatronics]] were by [[John Cox (special effects artist)|John Cox]]'s creature Workshop.<ref name=\"Tiff interview\">{{cite web| url=http://www.cinematical.com/2006/09/13/tiff-interview-the-host-director-bong-joon-ho/ | title=TIFF Interview: The Host Director Bong Joon-ho | author=Scott Weinberg | work=Cinematical | date=13 September 2006 | access-date=2007-01-12}}</ref>\nThe [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the film was done by [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], which also did some of the visual effects in ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=3678 | title=Oh Strange Horrors! | author=Barbara Robertson | work=CGSociety | date=27 July 2006 | access-date=2007-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe monster was designed with some specific parameters in mind. According to the director himself the inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River.<ref>Giuseppe Sedia (October 2007). [http://www.koreanfilm.org/bongjh.html \"An Interview with Bong Joon-ho\"]. ''Koreamfilm.org.'' Retrieved 2009-11-23.</ref>\nTherefore, the director's wishes were for it to look like an actual mutated fish-like creature, rather than have a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two fishermen presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still small enough to fit in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film.<ref name=\"Tiff interview\" /> For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only about the size of a truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reverseshot.com/article/host | title=The Host ...With the Most | author=Adam Nayman | work=Reverse Shot | access-date=2007-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Political background==\nThe film was in part inspired by an incident in 2000, in which a Korean [[mortician]] working for the U.S. military in [[Seoul]] reported that he was ordered to dump a large amount of [[formaldehyde]] down the drain. In addition to its environmental concerns, this caused some antagonism toward the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/08/11/2006081161014.html | title=U.S. Army Keeping Close Eye on Han River Monster }}</ref> The American military stationed in South Korea is portrayed as uncaring about the effects their activities have on the locals. The chemical agent used by the American military to combat the monster in the end, named \"Agent Yellow\" in a thinly-veiled reference to [[Agent Orange]], was also used to satirical effect.<ref name=\"Tiff interview\" /> The director, Bong Joon-ho, commented on the issue: \"It's a stretch to simplify ''The Host'' as an anti-American film, but there is certainly a metaphor and political commentary about the U.S.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=5825 | title=Korean filmmakers take center stage to bash trade talks | author=Heejin Koo | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=7 September 2006 | access-date=2007-01-13}}</ref>\n\nBecause of its themes, which can be seen as critical of the United States, the film was lauded by [[North Korea]]n authorities,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20061116/670000000020061116113602E4.html | title=North Korea lauds S.

Korean youth protesters are featured satirically in the film, in a mixed way, partially heroic and partially self-righteous and oblivious. According to Bong Joon-ho, the Park Nam-il character is a deliberate anachronism, a reference to South Korea's troubled political history, which involved violent protest. \"When you look in terms of this character, it's sort of like the feeling of time going backwards. [...] You could say that he is the image of the college protester back ten years ago; it doesn't exist in the present day.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hollywoodgothique.bravejournal.com/entry/24485 | title=The Host: Monstrous Political Satire | work=Hollywood Gothique Daily Journal | date=7 March 2007| access-date=2007-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\nThe film was released theatrically in Australia on August 17, 2006.
