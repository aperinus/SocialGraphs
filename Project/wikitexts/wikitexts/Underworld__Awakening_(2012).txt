It was followed by ''[[Underworld: Blood Wars]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nA few years after the events of [[Underworld: Evolution|the second film]], both the government and the general public have become aware of the existence of the Vampires and Lycans. A program to study and potentially harness their powers soon escalates into an all-out genocide and shortly after the Purge begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, Selene is imprisoned in [[cryogenic suspension]].\n\nAfter being frozen for twelve years, during which both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape. She learns that another subject has also fled from the facility. While running away, Selene has visions from someone else's point of view. She follows the visions and encounters David, a young vampire who has been tracking her. Sick and weakened Lycans also appear; they are hunting the subject with whom Selene is connected. Selene fights her way through the Lycan pack and reaches the second escapee: a frightened and confused young girl.\n\nSelene, David and the girl drive away using David's van, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David and Selene kill two while the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle and bites the girl's shoulder. She partially transforms and rips the creature in half, revealing her hybrid traits. Selene realizes this is her and Michael's daughter. During her own escape from the facility, the girl found Selene's cryogenic tank and deactivated it. That is why Selene could escape. Despite her hybrid nature, the girl's bite wound does not heal and she is rapidly growing weaker, so David decides to take the pair to his coven.\n\nAfter she reluctantly drinks some blood, her wound heals. But as they do not feel welcome in the coven, due to the fact that the girl is noticeably different from Vampires, Lycans and even Hybrid, Selene prepares to leave. David tries to convince her to stay and help them start an offensive against the humans. Before she makes up her mind, the coven comes under attack by Lycans. Selene joins the fight and kills many Lycans before being knocked unconscious by a huge \"Super-Lycan\" that heals instantly and is not affected by silver. She later awakenens and finds that Thomas, David's father, has surrendered her daughter to the Lycans in return for them leaving. David has been mortally wounded in the battle, but Selene revives him with her blood. After leaving, she confronts Sebastian, a human detective who is sympathetic to the vampires due to his dead wife being a vampire. Sebastian confirms that the Lycans have been traced to Antigen, the corporation dedicated to killing off vampires. They also run the facility from which Selene has escaped.\n\nAntigen is actually run by Lycans, who have been posing as humans in order to trick the world's governments into believing the Lycans are extinct. The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and needs the DNA of Selene's daughter to do so. The \"Super-Lycan\" Selene faced earlier is Quint, Lane's son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian assault Antigen to stop Lane and save Selene's daughter, who they begin calling \"Eve\". Selene comes across Subject 0, whom she identifies as Michael, and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave the thawing Michael in order to stop the Lycans from escaping with Eve. David, who since being healed by Selene's blood has inherited her immunity to sunlight, arrives and helps the heroes. In the ensuing fight, Selene confronts Quint. She tricks him into returning to his more vulnerable human form by hiding in a narrow tunnel and kills him by implanting a silver grenade in his stomach. Meanwhile, Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. As the police arrive, Selene, Eve, and David return to Michael's tank and find it empty. Knowing that the world will be hunting Michael, the trio vows to find him first.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]]\n* [[India Eisley]] as Eve, a hybrid; daughter of Selene and Michael Corvin.

It was actually the first original sequel story starring Selene, since originally the first two films were one long script. Screenwriter John Hlavin was the first one who wrote the script based on Wiseman's story that same year. Between 2009 and 2011 it went through many re-writes and changes by other writers, including some who are not credited in the final film. One of the credited writers, [[J. Michael Straczynski]], wrote his version in September 2010, right when [[Kate Beckinsale]] officially signed on to star in the film. Wiseman himself also did some revisions on the script before filming started, sometimes alone or with other writers. A February 2011 draft of the script lists revision credit he did with another writer, Allison Burnett, who already did his own re-write of the script earlier.\n\nDespite it already going through a number of writers and different versions, the film began principal photography without a finished script in March 2011 at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Due to all the changes made on the script, lot of the first promotional material was based on earlier storyline, which is why it includes some differences. For example, Antigen was originally called BioCom, Selene was imprisoned by the corporation for 15 years instead of 12, her daughter was originally called Nissa and she was 14 years old instead of 11, and original title would have been ''Underworld 4: New Dawn'', although in August 2011 interview producer Richard Wright said how many different subtitles were suggested and thrown out, including ''Underworld 4: New Moon''.\n\n[[M\u00e5ns M\u00e5rlind]] and Bj\u00f6rn Stein said in interviews how while the story for the film was good, nobody was \"super happy\" about the script. While it was keep getting changed, the tone of it kept going from more of a \"wink-wink\" with some humor and irony, to more serious one like original films were. M\u00e5rlind and Stein also ended up working on script re-writes, along with Wiseman, producer [[Gary Lucchesi]] and another new screenwriter, but none of them were credited in the film.\n\nWright also mentioned how for some reason production of this film was more difficult than others. Wiseman, who was working on remake of ''[[Total Recall (2012 film)|Total Recall]]'' at the same time, was often called for help, and sometimes he would have to re-write a scene during night which was going to be filmed the next day. M\u00e5rlind and Stein also said how entire ending is not the one which they originally had when production started, and how ending which is in the film was written during filming, although they gave no details about what the original ending was. Earlier versions of the script also included alternate opening, in which Selene's cryo tank is destroyed by some escaped mutated Lycan, who would then stalk weakened Selene around the lab until she manages to escape. This was possibly changed due to problems scene would cause with trying to cut around nudity. Selene would then find a medical gown which she would wear through rest of the film until she finds an outfit very similar to her old one inside David's vampire coven. This later part of this scene was still kept in January and February 2011 revised drafts of the script but in the film this was changed so her original outfit is kept in the same room where she is. The plot part about corporation planning to use Selene and Eve as breeders of super hybrids was also dropped and instead in the film they are after Eve's DNA.\n\nUnfinished and constantly changing script also caused some issues for second unit director and visual effects supervisor James McQuaide, who did not know how was he supposed to design Lycan creatures in the film. Some of the storyboards for the film by Martin Bergquist also reveal how entire scenes including some action sequences were fully planned but ended up getting cut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/kate-beckinsale-signs-up-for-underworld-4/|title=Kate Beckinsale Signs Up For Underworld 4|author=Dave Golder|date=September 24, 2010|website=Gamesradar.com|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/underworld-4-will-new-dawn/|title=Underworld 4 Will Be A New Dawn|website=Empireonline.com|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/underworld-4-new-dawn-synopsis-kate-beckinsale/|title=First Synopsis for UNDERWORLD 4: NEW DAWN|date=November 23, 2010|website=Collider.com|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/richard-wright-underworld-4-awakening-interview/|title=Producer Richard Wright UNDERWORLD 4 AWAKENING Interview|date=August 22, 2011|website=Collider.com|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/25968/set-visit-selene-comes-full-circle-in-underworld-awakening-3d/|title=[Set Visit] Selene Comes Full Circle in 'Underworld: Awakening 3D'!|first=Chris|last=Eggertsen|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=August 22, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://martinbergquist.blogspot.com/2012/04/more-underworld.html|title=Martin Bergquist: More Underworld...|website=Martinbergquist.blogspot.com|date=April 13, 2012|access-date=February 24, 2022}}</ref><ref>Underworld 4 - Awakening (2012) - Story and Screenplay by John Hlavin & Len Wiseman, Revisions by John Hlavin, J.
