Now the woman has been nominated for sainthood.\n\nHaving never encountered a genuine [[miracle]], he is known as the \"Miracle Killer\" for his track record for [[debunker|debunking]] false claims of miracles.  Father Frank is suffering a crisis of faith when he is sent to investigate the miracles of a woman, the late Helen O'Regan who has been nominated for [[saint]]hood, and winds up becoming the greatest advocate for her [[canonization]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/181295/The-Third-Miracle/overview | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019110849/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/181295/The-Third-Miracle/overview | url-status=dead | archive-date=October 19, 2010 | title=Movies: About The Third Miracle | first=Stephen | last=Holden | department=Movies & TV Dept. | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] | author-link=Stephen Holden | date=2010 | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFather Frank uncovers a series of extraordinary events but the most extraordinary thing of all may be the \"saint's\" very earthly daughter, Roxane ([[Anne Heche]]).
