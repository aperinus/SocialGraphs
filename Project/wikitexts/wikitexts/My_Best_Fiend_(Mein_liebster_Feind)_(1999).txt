It was released on [[DVD]] in 2000 by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film opens with shots of [[Klaus Kinski]] performing, after his own interpretation, the role of [[Jesus]]. Kinski harangues the audience for not paying attention to him, curses wildly, has the microphone taken away from him, and, screaming, steals it back. This is the tour Kinski left to star in Herzog's film ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972). This was the first of five films that the two would make together, the others being ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' (1978); ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'' (1978); ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982); and ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987).\n\nAfter this opening, Herzog tours a substantially renovated apartment that he and his family shared with Kinski and other boarders. Herzog then tours some of the countries he and Kinski filmed at. He looks at the first film clip he ever saw of Kinski and presents footage from the sets of their various movies. He recounts the heated and sometimes violent altercations between them, including the oft-repeated story of how he threatened to shoot Kinski should he leave the production of ''Aguirre''. He also draws on footage from ''[[Burden of Dreams]]'' (1982), a documentary about the making of ''Fitzcarraldo'', which was a particularly difficult film for their relationship.\n\nAt the same time, Herzog expresses deep respect for Kinski's acting talent. Interviews with two of the women who starred opposite him, [[Eva Mattes]] (from ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'') and [[Claudia Cardinale]] (from ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]''), suggest that the actor had a calmer side. Herzog also meets with Beat Presser, a photographer who has displayed many photos of Herzog and Kinski. One of these photos is used as the film's poster. The final sequence in the film shows Kinski playing with a [[butterfly]] in the [[Peru]]vian jungle.\n\nHerzog describes Kinski's death as the result of having lived so strenuously and fully, describing him as \"like a comet\". His voice is heard over the final scene of ''Cobra Verde,'' in which Kinski collapses in the surf as he tries to pull a large boat out to sea.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe documentary was screened out of competition at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5316/year/1999.html |title=Festival de Cannes: My Best Fiend |accessdate=2009-10-11|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It has an 80% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 7.00/10.<ref>{{Rotten-tomatoes|id=my_best_fiend|title=My Best Fiend}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the film \"[a] captivating documentary, a film that serves as an eloquent coda to their unforgettable creative partnership.\".<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=&title2=My%20Best%20Fiend%3A%20Klaus%20Kinski%20%28Movie%29%20%20&reviewer=Janet%20Maslin&v_id=180024&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes Janet Maslin's review], ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of a possible four, saying:\n\n{{bquote|As a meditation by a director on an actor, it is unique; most show-biz docs involve the ritual exchange of compliments.

Herzog and Kinski had a similarly volatile relationship, which ended only after Kinski died, in 1991. Herzog got his revenge by releasing outtakes of his difficult star, much as Edwards continued to fiddle around with unreleased footage of Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]''. Herzog offers a personal documentary about Kinski and himself\u2014recollecting particular tantrums and outrages while speculating on their significance, revisiting the Peruvian locations of some of their joint efforts, interviewing former crew members, showing Kinski behaving vilely to everyone around him.<ref>[http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2000/0200/000211.html Jonathan Rosenbaum's Review, ''Chicago Reader'']</ref>}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[Independent film]] director Maverick Moore parodied both [[Louis Malle]]'s film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' and, \"the totally bonkers friendship between legendary filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] and controversial actor [[Klaus Kinski]]\" as chronicled in ''My Best Fiend'', in the awarding -winning short comedy film ''[[My Dinner with Werner]]''.<ref>[https://www.firstshowing.net/2022/watch-blind-date-dinner-comedy-short-film-my-dinner-with-werner/ Watch: Blind Date Dinner: Comedy Short Film; 'My Dinner with Werner'] by Alex Billington, February 3, 2022.</ref>\n* \"My Friend Falcon\", a fake \"behind the scenes\" episode of American TV show ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'' depicts director [[David Wain]]'s (as himself) contentious relationship with fictional cast member Justin Falcon (played by [[Ken Marino]]), parodying several scenes of ''My Best Fiend''.
