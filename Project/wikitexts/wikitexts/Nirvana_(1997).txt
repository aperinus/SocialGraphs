The film stars [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Diego Abatantuono]], [[Sergio Rubini]], and [[Stefania Rocca]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4802/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Nirvana |access-date=2009-09-27|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOijDwAAQBAJ|title=Simone Brioni and Daniele Comberiati, Italian Science Fiction: The Other in Literature and Film.

Asked by his creation (who feels everything the character in the game feels, including multiple deaths) to eliminate its existence, Jimi sets out to erase the game from the server of his employer, Okasama Star, before it's commercially released on Christmas Day, and thus spare Solo further suffering.\n\nJimi has been depressed since his wife Lisa ([[Emmanuelle Seigner]]) left him. He decides to make his search for her a part of his quest to delete Solo and the game.  Along the way he recruits Lisa's friend Joystick ([[Sergio Rubini]]) and tech wizard Naima ([[Stefania Rocca]]) to help him avoid suspicious representatives of Okasama Star, who employ increasingly forceful methods to stop him.  By the end, Jimi [[hacker (computer security)|hacks]] into one of the company's servers. This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi's life; the network defends itself by projecting virtual representations of people such as Jimi's father and Lisa. It tries to keep the hacker's mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker's brain. Jimi manages to pass through the network defence mechanism by freeing his mind, forgetting about life before or after, about bodily feelings, and entering a state of pure concentration where one focuses only on the target (in this case the server with the company's [[bank account]]). It is similar to [[meditation]] where one tries to concentrate on breathing; people who are able to do this are referred to as [[angel]]s (they are invisible to the system, can go anywhere they want, and their possibilities are limitless) in the film. In the end, Jimi feels enlightened and at inner peace with himself. He successfully deletes Solo, comes to terms with Lisa's leaving him, and understands why things happened the way they did. He is in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Yet, during the film ending credits, a message flashes - \"Naima is on line\" - meaning the whole Nirvana intrigue was indeed a game within another game, that the player (the spectator) completed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|style=width: 50em;|\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as Jimi Dini\n* [[Sergio Rubini]] as Joystick\n* [[Diego Abatantuono]] as Solo\n* [[Stefania Rocca]] as Naima\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Lisa\n* [[Amanda Sandrelli]] as Maria\n* [[Claudio Bisio]] as Red Rover\n* [[Gigio Alberti]] as Dr. Ratzenberger\n* [[Antonio Catania]] as Paranoia Vendor\n* [[Ugo Conti]] as Sicilian Tourist\n* [[Leonardo Gajo]] as Gaz-Gaz\n* [[Silvio Orlando]] as Indian Desk Clerk\n* [[Paolo Rossi (actor)|Paolo Rossi]] as Joker\n* [[Baskaran Pillai]] as the Guru\n* [[Bebo Storti]] as Meditating man\n* [[Alessandro Creamona]] as a policeman\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe director, [[Gabriele Salvatores]], shot the film mainly in the disused [[Alfa Romeo Portello Plant|Alfa Romeo assembly plant]] in [[Portello (district of Milan)|Portello]], [[Milan]].
