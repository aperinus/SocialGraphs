Deposited with the unnamed baby is a note asking the unknown finder to take good care of her and a key, leading to a bag containing clues to the parents' identity. The trio sets out to find the baby's parents. The baby is named {{nihongo|Kiyoko|\u6e05\u5b50}} by Hana, based on the Japanese translation of \"[[Silent Night]]\" literally meaning \"pure child\", as she is found on [[Christmas Eve]]. Outside a [[cemetery]], the group encounters a high-ranking [[yakuza]] boss trapped under his car. The man happens to know the owner of the club where Kiyoko's mother used to work; his daughter is going to be marrying the club's owner that day. At the wedding reception, the groom tells them that the baby's mother is a former bar girl named Sachiko. He gives them Sachiko's address, but the party is interrupted when a maid, revealed to be a Latino [[Contract killing|hitman]] in disguise, attempts to shoot the bride's father. The hitman kidnaps Miyuki and baby Kiyoko while holding them hostage at gunpoint and takes them back to his home. There, Miyuki befriends the hitman's wife who happens to have a child of her own and they begin bonding (despite their language barrier). While looking through old photo albums, Miyuki tearfully confesses to fleeing her home after stabbing her over-controlling father Ishida when her beloved cat Angel went missing (believing that he had gotten rid of it).\n\nHana searches for Miyuki and Kiyoko while Gin takes care of an elderly homeless man who is dying in the street. After giving Gin a little red bag, the old man peacefully passes away. Some teenagers show up and beat up Gin and the dead old man's corpse. Meanwhile, Hana finds the girls and they go off to find a place to stay. They go to Angel Tower, a club where Hana had worked at before quitting her job for assaulting a rude and intoxicated customer years ago. Gin, who was rescued by another member of the club, is also there. While there, it's learned that Hana had become homeless when her lover Ken had died from injuring himself after slipping on a [[Soap|bar of soap]] in the bathroom. The trio set out to find Sachiko's house, but they discover that it has been torn down. They are informed of the unhappy relationship between Sachiko and her husband, who is a gambling alcoholic. The group rests at a store until they are told to leave by the clerk. Hana collapses, and is taken by Gin and Miyuki to the hospital. Once at the hospital, Gin finds his estranged daughter, who is also named Kiyoko, working as a nurse. Hana berates Gin in front of his daughter and storms out of the hospital, with Miyuki following behind with baby Kiyoko in hand. Hana and Miyuki find Sachiko about to jump off a bridge. Sachiko insists that her husband got rid of the baby without her knowledge, and that they return the baby to her.\n\nGin finds Sachiko's husband, who confirms a TV report Gin saw earlier that Kiyoko was actually stolen by Sachiko from the hospital. They chase after Sachiko and Kiyoko. After an intense car chase, Miyuki chases Sachiko to the top of a building. Sachiko reveals she became pregnant in hopes it would bring her closer to her husband. When her baby was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], she decided to kidnap Kiyoko from the hospital's nursery, thinking, in her grief, the baby was hers. As Sachiko is about to jump off the building intending to commit suicide with Kiyoko in her hands, her husband comes out of his apartment, located just across the street, and begs her to start over with him. Sachiko jumps off nevertheless, but Miyuki manages to catch her before she falls, but then Sachiko accidentally drops Kiyoko. Hana jumps off the building after Kiyoko, catches the baby, and lands safely due to a miraculous gust of wind. Hana, Miyuki, and Gin are taken to the hospital. Miyuki hands Gin his cigarettes and drops the old man's small red bag on the floor, revealing a winning [[lottery]] ticket. Kiyoko's real parents want to ask the trio to become her godparents. When a police inspector introduces them to the trio, the inspector is revealed to be Miyuki's father.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+''Tokyo Godfathers'' cast\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n!<small>[[Animax]]/ Red Angel Media<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tokyo Godfathers|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Tokyo-Godfathers/|access-date=2020-12-24|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US}}</ref></small>\n!<small>[[GKIDS]]/ [[NYAV Post]] (2019)<ref name=\"engdub\">{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Jennifer|date=February 13, 2020|title=GKIDS Announces New English Dub Cast for Satoshi Kon's Tokyo Godfathers Film|work=[[Anime News Network]]|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-13/gkids-announces-new-english-dub-cast-for-satoshi-kon-tokyo-godfathers-film/.156415|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"fulldubcredits\">{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Victoria|date=March 12, 2020|title=Go team!\ud83d\ude0a #TokyoGodfathers @GKIDSfilms @nyav_post @stephaniesheh @MSinter @Shakeenz @jonavner|website=[[Twitter]]|url=https://twitter.com/vgraceactress/status/1237972513033842689|access-date=May 31, 2020}}</ref></small>\n|-\n!Gin\n|[[T\u014dru Emori|Tooru Emori]]\n|Darren Pleavin\n|Jon Avner\n|-\n!Hana\n|Yoshiaki Umegaki\n|Russel Wait\n|[[Shakina Nayfack]]\n|-\n!Miyuki\n|[[Aya Okamoto]]\n|Candice Moore\n|Victoria Grace\n|-\n!Kiyoko\n|[[Satomi K\u014drogi|Satomi Koorogi]]\n|\n|[[Kari Wahlgren]]\n|-\n!Oota\n|[[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka|Shouzou Iizuka]]\n|\n|[[Jamieson Price]]\n|-\n!Mother\n|[[Seiz\u014d Kat\u014d|Seizou Katou]]\n|\n|[[Kate Bornstein]]\n|-\n!Yasuo\n|[[Hiroya Ishimaru]]\n|\n|[[Kirk Thornton]]\n|-\n!Homeless Man\n|[[Ry\u016bji Saikachi|Ryuuji Saikachi]]\n|\n|David Manis\n|-\n!Ishida\n|[[Yusaku Yara|Yuusaku Yara]]\n|\n|[[Crispin Freeman]]\n|-\n!Sachiko\n|[[Kyoko Terase|Kyouko Terase]]\n|\n|Larissa Gallagher\n|-\n!Gin's daughter Kiyoko\n|[[Mamiko Noto]]\n|\n|[[Erica Schroeder]]\n|-\n!Doctor\n|[[Akio \u014ctsuka|Akio Ootsuka]]\n|\n|[[Jamieson Price]]\n|-\n!Arao\n|[[Rikiya Koyama]]\n|\n|[[Michael Sinterniklaas]]\n|-\n!Kurumizawa\n|Inuko Inuyama\n|\n|[[Philece Sampler]]\n|-\n!Yamanouchi\n|[[Kanako Tahara|Kanako Yahara]]\n|\n|[[Philece Sampler]]\n|-\n!Cat Lady\n|[[Rie Shibata]]\n|\n|[[Erica Schroeder]]\n|-\n!Taxi Driver\n|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera|Kouichi Yamadera]]\n|\n|[[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]]\n|}\n\n===Additional voices===\n'''Japanese:''' [[Akiko Kawase (actress)|Akiko Kawase]], Akiko Takeguchi, [[Atsuko Yuya]], Bin Horikawa, [[Chiyako Shibahara]], Eriko Kawasaki, Hidenari Umezu, Kazuaki Itou, Masao Harada, [[Mitsuru Ogata]], Nobuyuki Furuta, Toshitaka Shimizu, [[Tsuguo Mogami]], Yoshinori Sonobe, [[Y\u016bto Kazama|Yuuto Kazama]]\n\n'''English ([[GKIDS]]):<ref name=\"fulldubcredits\" />''' [[Crispin Freeman]], David Manis, [[Erica Schroeder]], Jaden Waldman, [[Jamieson Price]], Jordan Cole, [[Kirk Thornton]], Lexie Foley, [[Gloria Garayua]], [[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]], [[Michael Sinterniklaas]], Orlando Rios, [[Philece Sampler]]\n\n==Production==\nDuring the production of ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', a producer from Madhouse asked Kon if he had any plans for his next film.
