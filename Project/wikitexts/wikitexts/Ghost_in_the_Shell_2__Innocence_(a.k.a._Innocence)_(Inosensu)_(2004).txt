The film serves as a [[standalone sequel]] to Oshii's 1995 film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' and is loosely based on the [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|manga]] by [[Masamune Shirow]].\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[Production I.G]] and [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]], [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Toho]] and D-Rights, and distributed by Toho. It was released in Japan on March 6, 2004, and was later released in the US on September 17, 2004 by [[Go Fish Pictures]]. The film's US box office performance had exceeded Go Fish Pictures' expectation.\n\n''Innocence'' received the 2004 [[Nihon SF Taisho Award]]. It was also in competition at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]], making it the first and only anime in history to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]]. The soundtrack for the film was released under the name ''[[#Soundtrack|Innocence O.S.T.]]'' and a related novel called ''Ghost in the Shell: Innocence - After the Long Goodbye'' was released on February 29, 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is loosely based on ''Ghost in the Shell'' manga chapter \"''Robot Rondo''\" (with elements of \"''Phantom Fund''\"). Opening in 2032, [[Public Security Section 9]] [[cybernetic]] operative [[Batou]] is teamed with [[Togusa]], an agent with very few cybernetic upgrades, following the events of ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''.\n\nAfter a series of deaths due to malfunctioning [[gynoid]]s\u2014doll-like sex robots\u2014Section 9 is asked to investigate. As the gynoids all malfunctioned without clear cause, the deaths are believed to be premeditated murders; Batou and Togusa are sent to investigate possible terrorist or political motives. Additionally, the most recent gynoid's remains show they all contained an illegal \"ghost\". Section 9 concludes human sentience is being artificially duplicated onto the dolls illegally, making the robots more lifelike, and possibly acting as a motive in the murders.\n\nCalled to a homicide scene, information warfare/technology specialist Ishikawa explains the victim is Jack Walkson, a consignment officer at gynoid company LOCUS SOLUS, who may have been killed by the [[Yakuza]]. A previous Yakuza boss was recently killed by a gynoid, so Ishikawa concludes Walkson was held responsible and killed in an act of revenge. Batou and Togusa enter a Yakuza bar to question the current boss, only to be threatened by the bar occupants. Batou opens fire, killing and wounding numerous gang members, including the cyborg that murdered Walkson. The current boss then admits his predecessor was somehow involved in LOCUS SOLUS, but insists he doesn't know how.\n\nEntering a store on his way home, Batou is then seemingly warned by [[Motoko Kusanagi|the Major]] and shot in the arm by an unseen assailant. Caught in a [[shootout|firefight]], Batou nearly kills the store owner in confusion, but is subdued when Ishikawa appears. While having his damaged arm replaced, Batou is informed by Ishikawa that his [[Cybernetic implant|e-brain]] was hacked, causing him to shoot himself and attack the store occupants. Ishikawa explains that Batou was hacked in order to cause further scandal following his Yakuza assault in an attempt to stop the Section 9 investigation.\n\nBatou and Togusa then head for the mansion of Kim, a soldier-turned-hacker with an obsession with dolls. Seemingly dead, Kim soon reveals he \"lives\" inside the shell of a human-sized [[marionette]], and discusses philosophy with his visitors. Kim admits ties to LOCUS SOLUS, divulging that the company has secret headquarters in [[international waters]]. Warned again by the Major, Batou realizes that Kim has secretly hacked into his and Togusa's e-brains, and is currently trapping them in a false reality. Resetting Togusa's brain, Batou subdues Kim, stating he knows Kim hacked his brain in the store.\n\nResolved to gather material evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a [[Proxy server|proxy]]. The ship's security becomes aware of the hacking and retaliates with a virus that fries Kim's cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard, easily slaughtering the poorly armed and panicked security force. As Batou fights to the ship's center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship's security.\n\nTaking control of the ship, the Major reveals to Batou the truth about the gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to [[Trafficking in human beings|traffic]] young girls, LOCUS SOLUS duplicated their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human \"ghosts\" to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a \"ghost dubbing\" machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, having learned the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process. This caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now. She responds that she'll always be beside him on the network, then disconnects from the gynoid.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\"| English\n|-\n!

For example, the film begins with a quotation from [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' from 1886: \"If our Gods and our hopes are nothing but scientific phenomena, then let us admit it must be said that our love is scientific as well.\" Other numerous quotations in the film come from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Confucius]], [[Descartes]], the [[Old Testament]], [[Meiji period|Meiji]]-era critic [[Sait\u014d Ryokuu]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Max Weber]], [[Jacob Grimm]], [[Plato]], [[John Milton]], 14th century playwright [[Zeami Motokiyo]], the [[Tridentine Mass]], and [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]], French Enlightenment philosopher and author of \"[[Man a Machine]]\".\n\nThe characters and their names contain many allusions to other older works. For example, the \"Hadaly\" model robots refer to a human-like robot named Hadaly featured in ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'', also the book that popularized the word ''[[Android (robot)|android]].'' The company LOCUS SOLUS is named for the [[Locus Solus|1914 novel]] by [[Raymond Roussel]], which also shares certain thematic elements with the film, such as a mansion containing [[tableaux vivants]]. The police forensic specialist, Haraway, is most likely named for [[Donna Haraway]], feminist author of ''[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]''. Haraway's character is likely based on [[Susan Calvin]] from Asimov's [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]]. The ''Robot'' series is also referenced in the film's androids as they comply with a modified version of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Third Law of Robotics]].\n\nDolls are also an important motif in ''Innocence''; many have \"spirits\" of some sort, but at the same time are not quite human. They are based on the art of [[Hans Bellmer]], a dollmaker famous for his disturbing, erotic ball-jointed female dolls.<ref>Monnet, Livia, 'Anatomy of Permutational Desire: Perversion in Hans Bellmer and Oshii Mamoru', ''Mechademia'' 5 (2010), 285-309</ref>\n\nThe parade sequence is based on a religious procession and a temple in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Oshii|first=Mamoru|title=Director's Commentary|work=Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2009 English dub, the murdered consignment inspector is called Jacques Vaucanson. His [[Jacques de Vaucanson|namesake]] was a 18th century French inventor who created automata in the image of man and of animals.\n\n==Production==\n''Innocence'' had a production budget of approximately [[United States dollar|$]]20 million (approximately 2 billion [[yen]]).<ref name=\"www.nt2099.com\"/> To raise the sum, Production I.G studio's president, Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, asked [[Studio Ghibli]]'s president, [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], to co-produce. [[Polygon Pictures]] produced the [[3DCG]] in the film.\n\n===Director's ideas===\nOn the origins of the movie, director [[Mamoru Oshii]] says he didn't envision it solely as a sequel to ''Ghost in the Shell''. He said, \"I had a dozen ideas, linked to my views on life, my philosophy, that I wanted to include in this film ... I attacked ''Innocence'' as a technical challenge; I wanted to go beyond typical animation limits, answer personal questions and at the same time appeal to filmgoers.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} During production, the first decision Oshii made was to not make ''[[Motoko Kusanagi]]'' the main character and instead make it a story about someone searching for her. Oshii chose to make the movie have a different tone and feel from the original.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Interview: Mamoru Oshii |url=https://archive.org/details/Play_034_Oct_04/page/n28?q=Ghost+in+the+Shell |magazine=[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]] |issue=34 |pages=28\u201329 |date=October 2004 |access-date=August 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOshii traveled the world in order to find inspirations for the film. Oshii based the appearance on the dolls created by [[Hans Bellmer]] he saw at the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York.<ref name=\"IGN-interview\">{{cite news|url =https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/17/interview-mamoru-oshii?page=1|title =Interview: Mamoru Oshii|publisher =IGN|date =2004-09-16|access-date =2012-12-05|archive-date =2019-11-14|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20191114103551/https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/17/interview-mamoru-oshii?page=1|url-status =live}}</ref> He credited [[Jean-Luc Godard]] for the idea of including quotes by other authors: \"[The texts] ... give a certain richness to cinema because the visual is not all there is. Thanks to Godard, the spectator can concoct his own interpretation ... The image associated with the text is a unifying act that aims at renewing cinema, that {{sic|let's}} it take to new dimensions.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nOshii noted his attention to detail might be particularly Japanese: \"I get absorbed in the finer points &ndash; like what the back of a bottle label looks like when you see it through the glass [demonstrates with a bottle of mineral water]. That's very Japanese, I suppose. I want people to go back to the film again and again to pick up things they missed the first time.\" Describing the overall look, the director said, \"The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. And as I said, there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at some of the things I liked as a child \u2014 the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world \u2014 not a future world.\"\n\nThe dog Gabriel, looking once more like the only \"real\" being, makes a key appearance, as in many of Oshii's movies. A scene with Batou feeding his dog is echoed in Ash in ''[[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]]'' (2001). He explained the reason why all his films feature a [[Basset Hound|basset hound]]\u2014his companion in real life: \"This body you see before you is an empty shell. The dog represents my body. Human beings can be free only if they free themselves from their bodies. When I am playing around with my dog, I forget that I am a human being, and it's only then that I feel free.\"\n\nAs for the state of [[art]] and [[animation]], Oshii had this to say:\n\n<blockquote>I think that Hollywood is relying more and more on [[3D computer graphics|3D]] imaging like that of ''[[Shrek]].'' The strength behind Japanese animation is based in the designer's pencil. Even if he mixes [[2D computer graphics|2D]], 3D, and computer graphics, the foundation is still 2D. Only doing 3D does not interest me.</blockquote>\n\nOn the overall message of the film, the director said \"This movie ... concludes that all forms of life \u2013 humans, animals and robots \u2013 are equal. In this day and age when everything is uncertain, we should all think about what to value in life and how to coexist with others.\" On his narrative intentions Oshii comments: \"I had a bigger budget than for ''Ghost in the Shell''. I also had more time to prepare it. Yet despite the economic leeway, abundant details and orientations, it was still important to tell an intimate story.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Title change===\nIn order to better market the film outside Japan, the ''Ghost in the Shell 2'' moniker was added to the title of the film, with '''''Innocence''''' becoming the subtitle. Some fans saw this as conflicting with Oshii's statements that the film wasn't, in actuality, a standard Hollywood-esque sequel, and was able to, and intended to, stand on its own.\n\n===English-language dub===\nWhen [[Go Fish Pictures]] released ''Innocence,'' they released it subtitled, without English dubbing, a controversial choice since every ''Ghost in the Shell'' anime released by [[Manga Entertainment]] outside of Japan had been dubbed. [[Anime News Network]] announced Manga Entertainment UK's co-production of an English dub with [[Madman Entertainment]], their Australian distributor and longtime partner,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence English Dub|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-17/ghost-in-the-shell-2-innocence-english-dub|work=Anime News Network|access-date=25 April 2014|date=17 May 2005|archive-date=6 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406094342/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-17/ghost-in-the-shell-2-innocence-english-dub|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Richard Epcar]]'s (the voice of Batou) Epcar Entertainment studio for the dubbing. This was the first dub Manga UK had produced since [[X (manga)|''X'']] in 1999 and the first dub Madman produced. This dub was released in the UK by Manga and in Australia by Madman Entertainment (using the Go Fish Pictures transfer). Bandai Entertainment under license from Paramount and DreamWorks created a second dub for the North American market using most of the voice actors from the Manga/Madman version making some changes to the cast and production team and using [[Animaze]]'s studio.\n\n==Related media==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Innocence O.S.T.\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Kenji Kawai]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 2004-03-03<br>2005-09-13 (UPC 669198251900)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071201163109/http://www.bandai-ent.com/products/audio_details.cfm?id=482 Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence CD Soundtrack ]</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[New-age music|New-age]], [[Ambient music|ambient]]\n| length     = 47\n| label      = [[Bandai Entertainment]]\n| producer   = [[Kenji Kawai]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Kenji Kawai]], who also did [[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|''Ghost in the Shell'']] soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenjikawai.com/intro_e.html|title=Profile|date=2002\u20132012|access-date=2010-05-07|archive-date=2010-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414214000/http://www.kenjikawai.com/intro_e.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As he expressed in the [[liner notes]], he agreed with Mamoru Oshii that the soundtrack pattern itself somewhat after \"would follow the music from the original film.\" Additionally, Oshii made specific requests for \"a huge music box,\" a \"jazzy theme,\" and a \"reprise of the song '[[Follow Me (Demis Roussos song)|Follow Me]]'\".\n\nThe music box, heard in the \"Doll House\" tracks, was procured from Sankyo Shoji. Wanting it to sound as if played in a huge space, Kenji Kawai had the music box recorded in studio, and then played back in the underground quarry of [[Utsunomiya|Ohya]] with four speakers and two [[subwoofers]], where it was recorded with eight microphones.\n\nThe [[Min'yo|minyoh]] singers chorus, heard in the \"Chants\" in the first movie, and in the \"Ballade of Puppets\" in ''Innocence'', was expanded to include 75 performers, which proved challenging to record. The session lasted for 14 straight hours.\n\n\"[[Follow Me (Demis Roussos song)|Follow Me]]\" is a reprise of a song originally interpreted by [[Demis Roussos]] in 1982.

The combo pack features the Japanese version and includes the official English audio track and subtitles, along with the special features.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[Manga Entertainment]], which released and co-produced the first film and collaborated with [[Bandai Entertainment]] to release the TV series, released ''Innocence'' with an English dub featuring the same cast as the one used in ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' in the UK on February 27, 2006. The Manga UK dub was co-produced with long-time anime partner, [[Madman Entertainment]] who has distributed Manga UK titles in Australia since its founding in 1996. The UK English dub on the Region 1 [[Blu-ray]] disc features an audio error where the soundtrack has been pitch-shifted down, resulting in unnatural sounding deep voices and mechanical sound effects in slow motion, because the dub was produced to PAL standards rather than NTSC. This is also present on the standard DVD.\n\n===Australia===\nThe controversy with licensing also affected its release in Australia. Although Madman licensed it through Go Fish Pictures, the English dub used is from Manga Entertainment, through which Madman have licensed all ''Ghost in the Shell'' properties. The licensing costs are extremely high due to two different licenses being in effect on the DVD release.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It is unknown whether Madman will use the Manga Entertainment dub or the Bandai dub for the Blu-ray version.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brown, Steven T., \"Machinic Desires: Hans Bellmer's Dolls and the Technological Uncanny in ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence''\", ''[[Mechademia]]'' 3 (2008), 222-253\n* Hartlieb, Sean, \"Humanity in Anime: Analyzing the Films of Mamoru Oshii\", 'Chapter Nine: Innocence' (2016), 347-453 \n* Monnet, Livia, \"Anatomy of Permutational Desire: Perversion in Hans Bellmer and Oshii Mamoru\", ''Mechademia'' 5 (2010), 285-309\n* Monnet, Livia, \"Anatomy of Permutational Desire, Part II: Bellmer's Dolls and Oshii's Gynoids\", ''Mechademia'' 6 (2010), 153-169\n* Monnet, Livia, \"Anatomy of Permutational Desire, Part III: The Artificial Woman and the Perverse Structure of Modernity\", ''Mechademia'' 7 (2012), 282-297\n* {{cite web |last=Ruh |first=Brian |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/brain-diving/2011-06-14 |title=The Faux and the Hound - BD |work=Anime News Network |date=14 Jun 2011 }}\n* {{cite web | last=Hartlieb | first=Sean | url=https://analyzingoshii.com/ | title=Analyzes on Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence | work=AnalyzingOshii }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works_sp/01_/index.html|name=Official page at Production I.G website}}\n* {{Anime News Network|type=anime|id=2081|noparen=true}}\n* {{IMDb title|0347246}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|ghost_in_the_shell_2_innocence}}\n* {{Mojo title|ghostintheshell2}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|306669}}\n* Essays on [https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inosensu ''Inosensu''] (''Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence'')\n* Analyzes on [https://analyzingoshii.com/ ''Inosensu''] (''Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence'')\n\n{{Mamoru Oshii}}\n{{Ghost in the Shell}}\n{{Masamune Shirow}}\n{{Production I.G films}}\n{{Studio Ghibli Films}}\n{{Animation Kobe Feature Film Award}}\n{{Tokyo Anime Award for Theatrical Film}}\n{{Polygon Pictures}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence}}\n[[Category:2004 anime films]]\n[[Category:2004 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:2004 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:Bandai Entertainment anime titles]]\n[[Category:Animated cyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mamoru Oshii]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2032]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Ghost in the Shell films]]\n[[Category:Go Fish Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Production I.G]]\n[[Category:Japanese sequel films]]\n[[Category:Studio Ghibli]]\n[[Category:Toho animated films]]\n[[Category:Anime films based on manga]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Manga Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Postcyberpunk]]\n[[Category:Postcyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Japanese adult animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
