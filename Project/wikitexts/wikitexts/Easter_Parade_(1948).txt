The music by [[Irving Berlin]] includes some of Astaire and Garland's best-known songs, including \"[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]\", \"[[Steppin' Out with My Baby]]\", and \"[[We're a Couple of Swells]]\".\n\nGene Kelly was originally cast opposite Judy Garland, but he broke his ankle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Easter Parade|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2332/easter-parade#articles-reviews?articleId=1130|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-21|website=www.tcm.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728061925/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2332/Easter-Parade/ |archive-date=July 28, 2011 }}</ref> The part was then offered to Fred Astaire, who had retired two years earlier.  Astaire, who was very eager to work again, consulted Kelly about the offer, and Kelly was happy to support his decision to take the role.  Garland and Astaire were a successful team, and Astaire was restored to his status as a top MGM star.\n\nA critical and commercial success, ''Easter Parade'' was the highest-grossing musical film of 1948, and the second-highest grossing MGM musical of the 1940s, after ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star Don Hewes (Fred Astaire) buys Easter presents for his sweetheart (\"Happy Easter\"), getting a boy to part with a [[Easter Bunny|plush rabbit]] by playing all the drums in the toy store (\"Drum Crazy\"). He takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale ([[Ann Miller]]), who has been offered the opportunity to star in a show\u2014solo. He tries to persuade her to stay with him (\"It Only Happens When I Dance With You\") but she has signed a contract. Don's best friend, Johnny ([[Peter Lawford]]), arrives. Nadine is clearly attracted to Johnny, but he resists her out of respect for Don.\n\nDon drowns his sorrows at the bar at Pastini's restaurant, bragging to Johnny and Mike the  bartender that he can make a star dancer out of any girl from the floor show.  He chooses Hannah Brown ([[Judy Garland]]). The next day, at rehearsal, he learns that she suffers from [[Body relative direction|left/right confusion.]]\n\nDon tries to turn Hannah into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her a similar wardrobe, and giving her the exotic stage name \"Juanita\". She makes several mistakes at their first performance (\"Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes\"), and the show is a fiasco.\n\nJohnny is instantly attracted to Hannah, singing \"A Fella With an Umbrella\" while walking her to rehearsal. He tries unsuccessfully to reunite Don with Nadine, who tells Don her friends are laughing, because Hannah is trying to be her. Don realizes his mistakes after Hannah sings\u2014and they dance to\u2014\u201cI Love a Piano\". He prepares routines better suited to her. Now known as \"Hannah & Hewes\", they become a great success  (\"[[I Love a Piano]],\" \"Snookie-Ookums\", \"The Ragtime Violin\", and \"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam'\u201d).\n\nAuditioning for the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], Hannah and Don meet the show's star\u2014Nadine.  Realizing that Nadine is Don's former partner, Hannah demands to know if they were in love. At their hotel, Don reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing Hannah and Nadine do not belong in the same show:  Nadine can't compare with Hannah. They are about to kiss, when Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner. He confesses that he fell in love with her during the rainstorm, but Hannah admits that she is hopelessly in love with Don.\n\nDon is in the audience when Nadine's show opens (\"Shakin' The Blues Away\"). Later, he reveals to Hannah that he has signed them to star in their own show and invites her out to do the town. She arrives at his apartment to find that he has arranged a private dinner. He makes the mistake of mentioning their act, and Hannah explodes, accusing him of treating their rendezvous like a dance rehearsal. She tries to leave, but he kisses her. She plays the piano and sings \"It Only Happens When I Dance With You,\" \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me I was in love with you?\u201d he asks, and they embrace.\n\nTheir show features Don and a large chorus (\"[[Steppin' Out with My Baby]]\")  followed by \"[[We're a Couple of Swells]]\", in which he and Hannah play bums. Afterward, they celebrate at the [[roof garden]] where Nadine is performing. The audience gives them a rousing ovation. Nadine is furious. After dancing to \"The Girl on the Magazine Cover,\" she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her: \"It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)\". Don reluctantly agrees. Hannah leaves.\n\nAt Pastini's, where she and Don first met, Hannah pours out her troubles to Mike (\"Better Luck Next Time\"). She finds Don waiting outside her apartment. He tries to explain himself, promising to wait all night for her to forgive him, but the house detective evicts him just before she opens the door. The next morning, Johnny tells Hannah that if he loved someone, he would show them.\n\nHannah is inspired. Flowers, a chocolate egg and a live bunny in a top hat arrive anonymously at Don's apartment, followed by Hannah, who reminds him of their date and sings ([[Easter Parade (song)|\"Easter Parade\"]]). Don puts a diamond ring on her left hand as they walk in the Easter parade.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Hannah Brown.\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Don Hewes. [[Gene Kelly]] was originally cast as Don, but he broke his ankle just prior to production.

Audiences finally got to see it in the 90s when an edited version was included in the 1994 compilation film ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]''.
