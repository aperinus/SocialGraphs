It features an ensemble cast with [[Clive Owen]] as the [[King Arthur|title character]], [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Lancelot]] and [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Guinevere]], along with [[Mads Mikkelsen]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Hugh Dancy]], [[Ray Winstone]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] and [[Til Schweiger]].\n\nThe film is unusual in reinterpreting [[King Arthur|Arthur]] as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] officer rather than the typical [[medieval]] [[knight]]. There have been several literary works that have also done so, including David Gemmell's Ghost King, Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles, and perhaps the strongest influence on this film, Bernard Cornwell's Warlord series. The producers of the film attempted to market it as a [[Historicity of King Arthur|more historically accurate version]] of the [[Arthurian legend]]s, supposedly inspired by new archaeological findings. The film also replaces the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|sword in the stone]] story with a more dark and tragic backstory of how Arthur claimed his sword [[Excalibur]]. The film was shot in [[Ireland]], [[England]], and [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=King Arthur (2004) Filming Locations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349683/locations |website=IMDB|publisher=IMDB|access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 5th century AD, the declining [[Roman Empire]] is withdrawing from [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], where the native [[Woads]], led by Merlin, stage an insurgency. A group of [[Sarmatian]] knights and their half-British Roman commander Artorius Castus, known as \"Arthur\", have fulfilled their duties to Rome and are preparing to return [[Sarmatia|home]]. Arthur himself plans to continue his career in [[Rome]] until Bishop Germanus orders them to complete one final mission: evacuate an important Roman family from north of [[Hadrian's Wall]], saving them from an advancing army of invading [[Saxons]] led by the ruthless Cerdic and his son, Cynric. Alecto, the son of the family patriarch, is a viable candidate to be a future [[Pope]]. Arthur and his remaining men \u2013 Lancelot, Tristan, Galahad, Bors, Gawain, and Dagonet \u2013 reluctantly accept the mission.\n\nArriving at their destination, they find that the Roman patriarch Marius, who refuses to leave, has enslaved the local population, enraging Arthur. He discovers a cell complex containing a number of dead Woads and two tortured survivors \u2014 a young woman named Guinevere and her younger brother Lucan. Arthur frees them and gives Marius an ultimatum \u2014 leave with them willingly or otherwise be taken prisoner. He and his knights commandeer the homestead, and liberate its exploited people. The convoy flees into the mountains with the Saxons in pursuit. Marius leads an attempted coup but is slain by Guinevere. Arthur learns from Alecto that Germanus and his fellow bishops had Arthur's childhood mentor and father figure, [[Pelagius]], executed for [[Pelagianism|heresy]]. This further disillusions Arthur with the Roman way of life, a process that matures when Guinevere and Merlin remind Arthur of his connection to the island of Britain through his Celtic mother.\n\nArthur leads the pursuing Saxons, led by Cynric, through a pass crossing a frozen lake. As battle ensues, Dagonet sacrifices himself to crack the lake ice with his [[axe]], disrupting the Saxon advance. The knights safely deliver Alecto and his mother to Hadrian's wall and are officially discharged. Arthur, having concluded that his destiny lies with his mother's people, decides to engage the Saxons despite Lancelot's pleas to leave with them. The night before the battle, he and Guinevere make love, and on the following day, Arthur meets Cerdic under a white flag of parley, vowing to kill him. He is soon joined by Lancelot and his fellow knights, who decide to fight. In the climactic [[Battle of Badon|Battle of Badon Hill]], the Woads and knights whittle the Saxon army. Guinevere engages Cynric, who overwhelms her. Lancelot aids her and kills Cynric but is fatally wounded. Cerdic kills Tristan before facing off against Arthur, who kills the Saxon leader, condemning the invaders to defeat.\n\nArthur and Guinevere marry and Merlin proclaims Arthur as [[King of the Britons]]. United by their defeat of the Saxons and the retreat of the Romans, Arthur promises to lead the Britons against any future invaders. Three horses that had belonged to Tristan, Dagonet and Lancelot run free across the landscape, as the closing narrative from Lancelot describes how fallen knights live on in tales passed from generation to generation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Clive Owen]] as [[King Arthur|Arthur]]\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Lancelot]]\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Tristan]]\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as [[Gawain]]\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as [[Galahad]]\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as [[Bors]]\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Dagonet]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Guinevere]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Merlin]]\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]]\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as [[Cynric of Wessex|Cynric]]\n* [[Ivano Marescotti]] as [[Germanus of Auxerre|Bishop Germanus]]\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Marius Honorius\n* [[:it:Lorenzo De Angelis|Lorenzo De Angelis]] as Alecto\n* [[Sean Gilder]] as Jols\n* [[Stephanie Putson]] as Lancelot\u2019s mother \n* Pat Kinevane as Horton\n* [[Stefania Orsola Garello]] as Fulcinia\n* [[Charlie Creed-Miles]] as Ganis\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Roman officer\n* [[Alan Devine]] as British scout\n* Johnny Brennan as [[Sir Lucan|Lucan]]<!-- [[John G.

The historical consultant for the film was [[John & Caitlin Matthews|John Matthews]], an author known for his books on [[Esotericism|esoteric]] Celtic spirituality, some of which he co-wrote with his wife Caitlin Matthews. The research consultant was Linda A. Malcor, co-author of ''From Scythia to Camelot: A Radical Reinterpretation of the Legends of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail'', in which possible non-Celtic sources for the Arthurian legends are explored.\n\nThe film's main set, a replica of a section of Hadrian's Wall, was the largest film set ever built in Ireland, and was located in a field in [[County Kildare]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ryan |first=Dermot |url= http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/film-cinema/hollywood-heavyweights-fly-in-for-a-reel-taste-of-shakespeare-1424941.html |title=Hollywood heavyweights fly in for a reel taste of Shakespeare |publisher=Evening Herald |access-date=2010-09-21 |date=2008-07-01 }}</ref> The replica was one kilometre long, which took a crew of 300 building workers four and a half months to build.<ref>'Making of' featurette on DVD release of the film</ref> The fort in the film was based on the Roman fort named [[Vindolanda]], which was built around 80 AD just south of Hadrian's Wall in what is now called [[Chesterholm]] in [[Northern England]].\n\nFuqua was reportedly dissatisfied with the film which he attributed to interference by Disney.<ref name=\"DVDShiftUnrated\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2004/digital/features/in-pic-to-dvd-shift-unrated-rates-high-1117910285/|title=  In pic-to-DVD shift, 'unrated' rates high  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref> Fuqua said of the experience: \u201cDid I get to make the movie I wanted?

I mean, it\u2019s set in the Dark Ages, when people were inconsiderate and decided to bleed everywhere.\u201d<ref name=\"DVDShiftUnrated\" />\n\n==Relationship with Arthurian legend==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2008}}\n\n===Cinematic versus traditional portrayal===\n[[File:Maev.jpg|thumb|upright|Guinevere's warrior persona is closer to the ancient Queen [[Medb]] (romanticised above) of the Irish ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' than the Guinevere of Arthurian legend.  By J.C. Leyendecker, 1916]]\nThe film's storyline is not taken from the traditional sources, but is a work of creative fiction. The only notable exception to this is the inclusion of the Saxons as Arthur's adversaries and the [[Battle of Badon Hill]]. Most traditional elements of [[Arthurian legend]] are dropped, such as the [[Holy Grail]] and [[Tristan]]'s lover [[Iseult]]. The film barely includes the [[love triangle]] between Arthur, [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]]; while Guinevere and Arthur are romantically involved, only a few sequences depict a possible relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere. The film does not feature [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and [[Bedivere]].\n\nThe knights' characterisations in Arthurian legend are also dropped. For example, the film's portrayal of a boorish and lusty Bors, the father of many children, differs greatly from his namesake whose purity and celibacy allowed him to witness the Holy Grail according to legend. The cinematic portrayal of Bors is therefore much closer to the traditional depiction of [[Sir Kay]] than his legendary namesake. Lancelot and Galahad are portrayed as having similar ages, whereas according to traditional versions they are father and son, respectively (the film's approach is also found in modern Arthurian fiction&nbsp;\u2014 such as [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', in which they are brothers).\n\nThe cinematic portrayal of Guinevere as a Celtic warrior who joins Arthur's knights in battle is a drastic alteration from the demure \"[[damsel in distress]]\" of courtly romance.<ref name=\"Rowland\">Rowland, Robin (2004). [https://web.archive.org/web/20040716000044/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/features/kingarthur/ \"Warrior queens and blind critics.\"] [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]</ref>  Although there is historical and mythological precedent for \"sword-swinging warrior queens\", such as the British [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]], [[Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd]] of [[Wales]], or the various Celtic war goddesses, the film's portrayal of Guinevere is actually closer to the Queen [[Medb]] of the Irish ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]''<!--The Cattle Raid of Cooley-->.<ref name=\"Rowland\"/>  However, no source, early or late, describes Guinevere as either a warrior or a rustic Celt; in fact, in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', which contains one of the oldest accounts of the character, Guinevere has Roman blood while Arthur is an indigenous Celt.\n\nDespite the film's alleged historical angle, Merlin was not originally part of the legends. It is generally agreed that he is based on two figures\u2014''[[Myrddin Wyllt]]'' (Myrddin the Wild), and Aurelius Ambrosius, a highly fictionalised version of the historical war leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]]. The former had nothing to do with Arthur and flourished after the Arthurian period. The composite Merlin was created by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].\n\n===Differences between the film and the Arthurian legend===\nIn the film, Arthur's father is a Roman general from the [[Imperial Roman army]] and his mother is a Celtic woman. In the historical notes of the legend, Arthur's father is [[Uther Pendragon]], a famous Romano-British commander and one of Britain's earlier kings, and his mother is [[Igraine]], a beautiful young woman who was once the wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall and one of Uther's loyal subjects.\n\nArthur's knights are described differently in the film and the legend. In the film, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors and the other [[Knights of the Round Table]] are Sarmatian knights fighting for the glory of the Roman Empire. In historical notes, the Knights of the Round Table are Britons, knights of Romano-Celtic Britain fighting for the freedom of Britain against the Saxons.  A round table is briefly present in the movie, where Arthur's knights regularly meet in equality, and which flummoxes the bishop Germanus when he cannot find a place at the table to distinguish his stature.\n\n===Other references to Arthurian legend===\nDagonet, a self-sacrificing warrior in the film, has Arthur's court jester as his namesake. The character appears in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and ''[[Idylls of the King]]''. Also in the film, Lancelot fights [[Dual wield|using two swords]]. This may be a reference to the ill-fated [[Sir Balin]], the \"Knight with Two Swords\", but this epithet refers to his cursed sword rather than his fighting style.\n\nTristan has a pet [[hawk]]. In Welsh legends, a figure named ''Gwalchmai'' is commonly considered identical with Gawain (both are nephews of Arthur); a popular though unlikely proposed meaning of his name is \"hawk of May\".<ref name=\"Bromwich\">[[Rachel Bromwich|Bromwich, Rachel]]. ''[[Trioedd Ynys Prydein]]'', pp. 367\u2013371.</ref>\n\nThe role of traitor, typically ascribed to [[Mordred]], is given a smaller part in the form of a young British scout, played by [[Alan Devine]], who betrays his people to the Saxons. The character is unnamed, but called \"British Scout\" in the credits. Tristan kills the traitor with an arrow from the other side of Hadrian's Wall during the climactic battle.\n\n===Relationship with other works===\nItalian historian and novelist [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]] claimed that the movie was almost a [[plagiarism]] of his 2002 novel ''The Last Legion'', due to several similarities between the two works.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLt0CerB1vk&t=312  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/oLt0CerB1vk |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Introduction to the movie \"The Last Legion\" hosted by Valerio Massimo Manfredi and Lorenzo Baccesi |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2016-01-04 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> These similarities include the reuse of some tropes and happenings present in the book and, especially, the attempt to give [[Historicity of King Arthur|historical reliability]] to the main characters with the concept of [[King Arthur]] having Roman origins. Indeed, the events of the movie suggest a theory that is largely different from the one on which Manfredi's novel is based, in which [[Artorius Castus]] isn't even mentioned, and neither is the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] auxiliary army. According to Manfredi, ''King Arthur'''s release and its commercial failure were among the main causes of the problems related to the [[The Last Legion|movie adaptation]] of his novel, which was in [[development hell]] until its release in 2007.\n\n==Historical notes==\nDespite the film's supposedly historically grounded approach, much [[artistic licence]] is taken regarding historical figures, peoples, events, religion, wardrobe, and weaponry. The film places the story of Arthur not in its better-known medieval setting, but in the (still plausible) earlier times of [[Late antiquity|antiquity]], the early dawn of the [[Middle Ages]] \u2013 as did the earliest versions of the Arthur story. It would appear that the Arthur depicted in the film is based most closely upon [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], the [[Romano-British culture|Romano-Briton]] who fought against the Saxons in the 5th century, and was probably the leader of the Romano-British at the [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]] (Mount Badon). Nevertheless, Arthur's full name in the film is ''Artorius Castus'', referring to [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a historical Roman active in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century.<ref name = \"indielondon\">[[John and Caitlin Matthews|Riederer, Chris]]. [http://www.indielondon.co.uk/film/king_arthur_historical_facts.html King Arthur - Key historical facts.]. Retrieved September 9, 2007.</ref> It is specified that Arthur was given the ancestral name of a legendary leader.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the \"Sarmatian hypothesis\", formulated by C. Scott Littleton and Ann C. Thomas in 1978, which holds that the Arthurian legend has a [[Historical basis for King Arthur|historical nucleus]] in the [[Sarmatian]] heavy cavalry troops stationed in Britain,<ref>C.Scott Littleton - A.C. Thomas: \"The Sarmatian Connection: New Light on the Origin of the Arthurian and Holy Grail Legends.\" Journal of American Folklore 91, 1978, pp. 512-527</ref> referencing the similarities between the legends of king Arthur and the older legends of Nartian king [[Batraz]].  In the 2nd century, 5,500 [[Iazyges]] were transported there as [[auxilia]]ries during the [[Marcomannic Wars]].<ref name = \"cathy\" /> However, the hypothesis is not accepted by scholars who say it lacks a solid base.<ref>Richard Wadge, \"A British or Sarmatian Tradition,\" Folklore, Vol. 98, No. 2 (1987), pp. 204-215.</ref>\n\n===Roman political issues===\nIn the film, the [[Roman legions]] withdraw from Britain in AD 467; in reality, [[End of Roman rule in Britain|this was completed]] in the year 410, nearly 60 years before. Similarly, the opening text dictates that \"King Arthur and his [[Knights]] rose from a real hero who lived [...] in a period often called the Dark Ages\". The film, however, is set in 467. Some count the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] as beginning in [[Sub-Roman Britain]], after the last [[Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], [[Romulus Augustus]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]] in 476, nine years after the date for the setting of the film. The current Roman Emperor in the film's time would have been [[Anthemius]].\n\nThe Roman family which Arthur rescues lives north of [[Hadrian's Wall]] (in modern Scotland). Such a mission would be unlikely. At times there were Roman expeditions and forts as far north as  [[Cawdor]], near Inverness. There were periods, during the 2nd century, when Romans occupied areas as far north as the [[Central Lowlands]] (such as modern [[Falkirk]], where pieces of the [[Antonine Wall]] are still visible).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Romanized client states such as that of the [[Votadini]] did exist north of the wall even into the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Sub-Roman era]]. In general, however, Hadrian's Wall represented the extent of Roman rule in Britain.\n\n===Britons and Saxons===\nThe [[Picts]] are called \"[[Woad]]s\".<ref name = \"indielondon\" /><ref>Cathy Schultz, \"[http://www.stfrancis.edu/historyinthemovies/kingarthur.htm KING ARTHUR: Romans and Saxons and Picts, oh my!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217013034/http://www.stfrancis.edu/historyinthemovies/kingarthur.htm |date=2008-02-17 }},\" ''History in the Movies''</ref>  This word is a reference to one plant the Picts may have used to make blue paint;<ref name = \"indielondon\" /> however, the use of woad by the Picts is contested by scholars,<ref name = \"cathy\" /> and the historical Picts were never known by this name.<ref name=\"Woad1\">Lambert, Kym (2004) [http://www.dunsgathan.net/essays/woad.htm The Problem of the Woad].

These dates are not universally accepted, as some scholars argue for a date in the mid 5th century. Cf. Lapidge, Michael, \"Gildas's Education and the Latin Culture of Sub-Roman Britain\" in Gildas: New Approaches, 1984.</ref>\n\nThe Saxons are shown attacking Hadrian's Wall from the north. By 467 the Saxons were already occupying parts of Britain far south of the wall.<ref>Gildas, De Excido Britanniae</ref> Later in the film, Cerdic stops a warrior from raping a woman because it would lead to less-than-pure Saxon blood. This scene references the long-held belief that the [[Anglo-Saxons]] eradicated the Romano-Britons from the eastern part of the island. This contention, largely based on linguistic evidence, has been challenged by modern genetic analysis, which suggests extensive mixing between Anglo-Saxon and Briton populations. Some historians (and fiction writers<ref>Cf. Alfred Duggan, ''[[Conscience of the King]]''; [[Stephen Lawhead]], ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' series; [[David Drake]], ''[[The Dragon Lord (Drake novel)|The Dragon Lord]]''</ref>) have even suggested that Cerdic himself was at least part Briton. His name \"Cerdic\" has been argued to be a [[Germanisation|Germanised]] form of a [[Celtic onomastics|Celtic name]] such as [[Ceretic (disambiguation)|Ceretic]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> or [[Caradoc]].\n\n===Military technology===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lancelot from King Arthur 2004.png|thumb|Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) with a 5th century sword held together by a 20th century hex head [[screw]]]] -->\nHistorically, Sarmatians were armoured in the manner of [[cataphract]]s (full-length coats of [[scale armour]]); the film's Sarmatians are armoured with a mishmash of pseudo-Roman, Turkish, Mongol and Hunnic designs. The Saxons historically used [[bow (weapon)|bows]] (to a limited extent) and [[spear]]s instead of [[crossbow]]s during the period. Though there is evidence for the use of some form of crossbows by Romans (calling them ''[[Ballista|manuballistae]]'') and, some claim, the Picts,<ref name = \"indielondon\" /> the weapon was still not widely used in England until much later.\n\nSimilarly, the Woads use a [[trebuchet]]-like weapon to hurl flaming missiles at the Saxons, though the trebuchet was not re-introduced to Britain until the [[First Barons' War|Siege of Dover]] in 1216.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The Romans, however, reportedly used an early form of the trebuchet in their sieges.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nRoman soldiers displayed in the film are depicted as [[Legionary|legionaries]] with 2nd century armour. By AD 400, legionaries were no longer in use and [[comitatenses]] were the new replacements.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Religious inaccuracies===\nThe real [[Pelagius]] was a monk, not a bishop. He engaged [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]] in a debate on the theological issue of the relationship between [[Divine grace|grace]] and [[free will]]. However, the film confuses the issue of political freedoms and social choices (which were not issues in political debate in the 5th/6th centuries) with the principle of free will in relationship to God. When Arthur informs the people that \"You ...were free from your first breath!\", [[Roger Ebert]] notes that he is both \"anticipating by a millennium or so the notion that all men are born free, and overlooking the detail that his knights have been pressed into involuntary servitude.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/king-arthur-2004 Ebert, Roger. \"King Arthur\", July 7, 2004, RogerEbert.com]</ref> The [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]] denied [[original sin]] with its doctrine of the bondage of the will and the need for healing by God's grace.<ref name=\"pelagius\" />  Nor was Pelagius executed for heresy in Rome as the film indicates.

Butler's Lives of the Saints, c1956, p251-252</ref>\n\nThe film implies that the Pope (who in 467 was [[Pope Hilarius]]) was in control of the [[Western Roman Empire]], although it was actually ruled by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and ''de facto'' controlled by the ''[[Magister militum|Magistri Militum]]'' and other regional governors. The Pope would not gain the political power to grant lands and other comparable privileges until centuries after the setting of the film.

The combat scenes, though boisterous and brutal, are no more coherent than the story, which requires almost as much exposition as [[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|the last ''Star Wars'' film]]. Luckily there is an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents ''King Arthur'' from being a complete drag.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=A. O. |author-link=A. O.

There is a kind of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don't seem out of time and place like the cast of ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]''. They get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=King Arthur review |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=July 7, 2004 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/king-arthur-2004 |access-date=2015-05-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Robin Rowland (author)|Robin Rowland]] criticised critics who criticized the film for its Dark Age setting.<ref name=\"Rowland\"/> Rowland pointed out that several Arthurian novels are set in the Dark Ages, like [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s ''[[Sword at Sunset]]'' and [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s Merlin trilogy (''[[The Crystal Cave]]'', ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'' and ''[[The Last Enchantment]]''). However, these works have little in common with the film's story and Sarmatian angle. In response to criticism of the setting,  consultant on the film Linda A. Malcor said: \"I think these film-makers did a better job than most could have done when it comes to giving us something besides knights in tin foil and damsels in chiffon.... [they] deserve a lot of praise for the effort that they made.\"<ref name = \"youngs\" /> Fellow Arthurian scholar [[Geoffrey Ashe]]'s opinion was unfavorable.<ref name = \"youngs\" />\n\n==Director's cut==\nAn unrated director's cut of the film was released; it has extra footage of battle scenes as well as more scenes between Lancelot and Guinevere, whose traditional love triangle with Arthur is only hinted at here. The battle scenes are also bloodier and more graphic.\n\nSeveral scenes are also omitted from the director's cut, including one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.\n\n==Marketing==\nDespite these many drastic diversions from the source material (including the Welsh [[Mabinogion]]), the producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the [[Arthurian legend]]s. Other liberties were taken with the actors' appearances: Keira Knightley's breasts were enlarged for the US theatrical film poster. This practice angered Knightley, who says that it \"comes from market research that clearly shows that other women refuse to look at famous actresses and stars with small breasts.\" Later in 2006, Knightley claimed she is \"not allowed to be on a magazine cover in the US without at least a C cup because it 'turns people off'.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://posterwire.com/keiras-breasts/ |title=Enlarging Keira Knightley's Breasts |publisher=Posterwire.com |access-date=2012-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Video game==\n{{Main|King Arthur (video game)}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films based on Arthurian legend]]\n* [[List of historical drama films]]\n<!--\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Note\"}}-->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|King Arthur (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0349683|King Arthur}}\n* {{Amg movie|288380|King Arthur}}\n* {{mojo title|id=kingarthur|title=King Arthur}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1133964-king_arthur|title=King Arthur}}\n\n{{Films based on Arthurian legends}}\n{{Antoine Fuqua}}\n{{Jerry Bruckheimer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:King Arthur (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000s historical films]]\n[[Category:2000s war films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:Arthurian films]]\n[[Category:British action drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in Roman Britain]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 5th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wales]]\n[[Category:Fictional-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in classical antiquity]]\n[[Category:Scottish Gaelic-language films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer]]\n[[Category:Latin-language films]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Antoine Fuqua]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer]]\n[[Category:Picts in fiction]]\n[[Category:2004 drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Scottish films]]\n[[Category:English-language Welsh films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
