It is a [[remake]] of [[Luc Besson]]'s 1990 film ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]''.\n\nMaggie Hayward ([[Bridget Fonda]]) is a violent and unstable drug [[Substance dependence|addict]] found guilty of murdering a police officer, and is sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]]. Her death is faked, and a secret government agent named Bob ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) informs her that she is to become an assassin. She is given a makeover and training that transform her into a beautiful woman, and she is also trained as a killer. Her career as an assassin goes well at first. Then, after a mission goes awry, the agency sends in Victor ([[Harvey Keitel]]), a \"cleaner,\" to kill everyone and destroy the bodies.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], Maggie Hayward is a [[drug addict]] found guilty of [[murdering]] a police officer during a robbery shootout, and is about to be [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[lethal injection]]. Her demise is faked and a spy named Bob informs her that she has to work for him. Maggie, having little choice, reluctantly agrees to cooperate and begins a regimen of intensive training that includes not only [[martial arts]] and firearms training, but [[etiquette]] and computer use.\n\nSenior Operative Amanda transforms her into a refined, beautiful woman. She is taken on a dinner date with Bob, who informs her about the first job: an assassination of a VIP eating at the same restaurant. Maggie kills the VIP and his bodyguard and then is pursued by a team of the VIP's bodyguards. She shoots several of the bodyguards and then escapes from the kitchen by jumping down a laundry chute. This task was her final test and she has now completed her training.\n\nThe following morning she leaves for [[Venice, California]], where she enters into a romantic relationship with apartment house manager J.P. While her first assignments, both hit jobs, are ultimately successful, Maggie quickly comes to hate her work and tries to quit her job as a professional killer. As things progress between her and J.P. and her double life threatens their relationship, she asks for help in leaving the agency. Her request is denied, but Bob agrees to get her out of the agency if she completes the next task.\n\nThe new job is to masquerade as Angela, the girlfriend of Fahd Bakhtiar, an Iranian trading in [[nuclear weapons]]. As she prepares for the job, J.P. continues to complain about her mysterious friends and mocks the improvised backstory that Bob had provided for himself and Maggie.\n\nTaking out Angela proves problematic and results in the deaths of Angela's two bodyguards and the injury of Maggie's partner, Beth. Director Kaufman then sends in Victor, a \"cleaner\", to get rid of the bodies and salvage the mission. Unknown to Maggie, he has also been ordered to kill both agents as well because one failure results in death. After killing the wounded Beth in front of Maggie, he drives her to Fahd's home. At gunpoint, she gets Fahd to unlock his computer and reveal his secrets, but he avoids execution and she is forced to flee.\n\nAs they purportedly drive back to her residence, Maggie sees a gun in Victor's waistband and correctly suspects that he is going to kill her. This leads to a struggle and the car spins out of control. Ultimately, Victor is dragged over a ravine and killed. Maggie makes her way back to her apartment, but leaves sometime during the night. Bob subsequently learns of her disappearance from J.P. As Bob is leaving, he sees Maggie watching him through the mist. Instead of reporting her, he calls Kaufman informing him the cleaner is dead, and after some hesitation, tells him that Maggie is dead also.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Maggie Hayward / Claudia Anne Doran / Nina\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Bob\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as J.P.\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Amanda\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Victor 'The Cleaner'\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Kaufman\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as Angela\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Fahd Bakhtiar\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Drugstore Owner\n* [[Lieux Dressler]] as Johnny's Mom\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Stan 'Big Stan'\n* Ray Oriel as Burt\n* Spike McClure as Johnny 'Johnny D'\n* [[John Capodice]] as Detective #1\n* Robert Harvey as Detective #2\n* Mic Rodgers as Cop\n* [[Carmen Zapata]] as Judge\n* [[John Badham]] as Room Service Waiter\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as Beth\n* [[James Handy]] as Operative\n* Michael Runyard as Weapons Instructor\n* Bill M.

If I didn't feel the same degree of involvement with ''Point of No Return'' that I did with ''Nikita'' it may be because the two movies are so similar in plot, look, and feel. I had d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all through the movie. There are a few changes, mostly not for the better. By making the heroine's boyfriend a photographer this time instead of a checkout clerk, the movie loses the poignancy of their relationship; Nikita liked her clerk precisely because he was completely lacking in aggression.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930319/REVIEWS/303190301|title=Point of No Return review|last=Ebert|first=Roger|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=March 19, 1993|access-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> The film holds an approval rating of 52% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave, based on 25 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1042629-point_of_no_return|title=Point of No Return (The Assassin) (1993)|work=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number 2 at the U.S. box office, behind ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'', with a gross of $7.2 million for the weekend from 1,545 screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-23/entertainment/ca-14362_1_ninja-turtles-iii|title= Weekend Box Office Ninja Turtles Capture Top Spot|last=Fox|first=David|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 23, 1993|access-date=November 9, 2010}}</ref> It grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada and $19.9 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $49.9 million.<ref name=ww/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nMaggie/Claudia has a fascination with the singer/pianist/songwriter [[Nina Simone]].
