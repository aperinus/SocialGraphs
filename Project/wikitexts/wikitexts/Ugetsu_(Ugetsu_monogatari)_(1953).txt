It is based on stories in [[Ueda Akinari]]'s 1776 [[Ugetsu Monogatari|book of the same name]], combining elements of the ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (period drama) genre with a [[ghost story]].\n\nDrawing particularly from Ueda's tales \"The House in the Thicket\" and \"The Lust of the White Serpent\", the film is set in the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]] Japan. In a civil war-torn Japan a peasant farmer and potter risks leaving his wife and young son behind to make money selling pottery and ends up being seduced by a spirit that makes him forget all about his family. A subplot involves his friend, who dreams of becoming a great samurai and chases this goal at the unintended expense of his wife. Major themes include avarice, excessive ambition, indulgence in pleasures versus loyalty to one's family, modesty, and the dignity of honest labor.\n\nThe film won the [[Silver Lion]] Award at the [[14th Venice International Film Festival|1953 Venice Film Festival]] and other honours. ''Ugetsu'' is one of Mizoguchi's most celebrated films, regarded by critics as a masterpiece of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], credited with simultaneously helping to popularize Japanese cinema in the West and influencing later Japanese film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the farming village Nakanog\u014d, on the shore of [[Lake Biwa]] in [[\u014cmi Province]] in the [[Sengoku period]], Genj\u016br\u014d, a potter, takes his wares to nearby [[\u014cmizo Domain|\u014cmizo]]. He is accompanied by his brother-in-law T\u014dbei, who dreams of becoming a [[samurai]]. A respected sage tells Genj\u016br\u014d's wife Miyagi to warn him about seeking profit in times of upheaval, and to prepare for an attack on the village. Returning with profits, Miyagi asks him to stop but Genj\u016br\u014d nevertheless works to finish his pottery. That night, [[Shibata Katsuie]]'s army sweeps through Nakanog\u014d, uprooting Genj\u016br\u014d, T\u014dbei and their wives; Genj\u016br\u014d decides to take his pots to a different marketplace. As the couples travel across Lake Biwa, a boat appears out of the thick fog. The sole passenger tells them he was attacked by pirates, warns them, and dies. The men decide to return their wives to the shore but T\u014dbei's wife Ohama refuses to go. Miyagi begs Genj\u016br\u014d not to leave her, but is left on the shore with their young son Genichi clasped to her back. At market, Genj\u016br\u014d's pottery sells well. After taking his share of the profits, T\u014dbei buys samurai armor and sneaks into a samurai clan. Lost from her companions, Ohama wanders beyond Nagahama searching for T\u014dbei and gets raped by soldiers.\n\nNoblewoman Lady Wakasa and her female servant visit Genjur\u014d, ordering several pieces of pottery and telling him to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. There, Genj\u016br\u014d learns that [[Oda Nobunaga|Nobunaga's]] soldiers attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Wakasa and her servant. He also learns that Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genj\u016br\u014d is seduced by Lady Wakasa and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanog\u014d is under attack. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search Miyagi for food. She fights them and is stabbed, collapsing with her son clutching her back.\n\n[[File:Provinces of Japan-Omi.svg|thumb|150px|Location of [[\u014cmi Province]], the setting of ''Ugetsu'']]\n\nT\u014dbei presents the severed head of a general that he stole to the commander of the victor, receiving armor, a mount, and a retinue. T\u014dbei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there as a prostitute. T\u014dbei promises to buy back her honor.\n\nGenj\u016br\u014d meets a priest who tells him to return to his loved ones or accept death. When Genj\u016br\u014d mentions Wakasa, the priest reveals that she is dead and must be [[exorcism|exorcised]] and invites Genj\u016br\u014d to his home, painting Buddhist symbols on his body. Genj\u016br\u014d returns to the Kutsuki mansion. He admits that he is married, has a child, and wishes to return home. Wakasa refuses to let him go. She and her servant admit they are spirits, returned to this world so that Wakasa, slain before she knew love, could experience it. They tell him to wash away the symbols. Genj\u016br\u014d reaches for a sword, throws himself out of the manor, and passes out. The next day, he is awakened by soldiers accusing him of stealing the sword, but he denies it, saying it is from the Kutsuki mansion. The soldiers laugh at him, saying the Kutsuki mansion was burned down over a month ago. Genj\u016br\u014d arises and finds the mansion nothing more than a pile of burnt wood. The soldiers confiscate his money, but because Shibata's army burned down the prison, they leave him in the rubble. He returns home by foot, searching for his wife.\n\nMiyagi, delighted to see him, will not let him tell of his terrible mistake. Genj\u016br\u014d holds his sleeping son in his arms, and eventually falls asleep. The next morning, Genj\u016br\u014d wakes to the village chief knocking on his door. He is surprised to see Genj\u016br\u014d home and says that he has been caring for Genj\u016br\u014d's son. Genj\u016br\u014d calls for Miyagi; the neighbor asks if Genj\u016br\u014d is dreaming as Miyagi was killed after she was stabbed. The next morning, as T\u014dbei bought back Ohama's honor, they return to Nakanog\u014d. T\u014dbei reflects on his mistakes, both resolving to work hard from now on. Genj\u016br\u014d continues looking after Genichi and working on his pottery. Ohama gives Genichi a plate of food, which he takes and puts on his mother\u2019s grave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]], [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] and [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] star in the film.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Mori Masayuki.JPG\n | width1    = 220\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Kyo Machiko 1954.JPG\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      = \n | image3    = Tanaka Kinuyo directs the film Koibumi.JPG\n | width3    = 108\n | alt3      = \n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Machiko Ky\u014d]] as Lady Wakasa\n* [[Mitsuko Mito]] as Ohama\n* [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] as Miyagi\n* [[Masayuki Mori (actor)|Masayuki Mori]] as Genj\u016br\u014d\n* [[Eitaro Ozawa]] as T\u014dbei (as Sakae Ozawa)\n* Ichisaburo Sawamura as Genichi\n* Kikue M\u014dri as Ukon, Lady Wakasa's Nurse\n* [[Ry\u014dsuke Kagawa]] as Village Master\n* Eigoro Onoe as Knight\n* Saburo Date as Vassal\n* Sugisaku Aoyama as Old Priest\n* Reiko Kongo as an Old Woman in Brothel\n* Shozo Nanbu as Shinto Priest\n* Ichir\u014d Amano as Boatsman\n* Kichijir\u014d Ueda as Shop Owner\n* Teruko Omi as Prostitute\n* Keiko Koyanagi as Prostitute\n* Mitsusabur\u014d Ramon as Captain of Tamba Soldiers\n* Jun Fujikawa as Lost Soldier\n* Ryuuji Fukui as Lost Soldier\n* Masayoshi Kikuno as Soldier\n* Hajime Koshikawa\n* Sugisaka Koyama as High Priest\n* Ryuzaburo Mitsuoka as Soldier\n* Koji Murata\n* Fumihiko Yokoyama\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Kenji Mizoguchi 2.jpg|200px|thumb|Director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]] made the effects of war a major theme of his film.]]\nAfter the success of his previous film ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' (1952), Mizoguchi was offered to make a film by his old friend [[Masaichi Nagata]] at [[Daiei Film]] studios.

Nochimson, a common interpretation of the film is that Mizoguchi refashioned the stories of ''Ugetsu Monogatari'' to express regret about the pro-war extremism leading to [[World War II]], with Mizoguchi personally having made the pro-war [[propaganda film]] ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|The 47 Ronin]]'' in 1941.<ref>{{harvnb|Nochimson|2011|p=213}}</ref> These reflections on [[militarism]], greed and arrogance connected with audiences not only in Japan but around the world in the wake of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|McRoy|2015|pp=202\u2013203}}</ref> The subplot of T\u014dbei and Ohama particularly reflects the [[comfort women]], who were made into prostitutes by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Mizoguchi struggled with Daiei to give the subplot an unhappier ending than what appears in the film, in line with real comfort women's experiences after the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Nochimson|2011|pp=213\u2013214}}</ref> T\u014dbei's subplot reveals the mistake of war can also be a \"tragicomedy\".<ref name=\"Sultanik\">{{harvnb|Sultanik|1986|p=136}}</ref>\n\nAccording to British critic [[Tony Rayns]] the film's presentation of the vanity of a man, neglecting his family, is a critique of historic men in feudal Japanese culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Nochimson|2011|p=214}}</ref> In his relationship with Wakasa, Genj\u016br\u014d is insignificant and is seduced by something greater, that he can never comprehend.<ref name=\"Sultanik\"/> However, by neglecting his family, Genj\u016br\u014d failed to appreciate he has already been blessed with a good life, and in the process, loses it.<ref>{{harvnb|Stone|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\nAs a ghost story, the film delves into a relationship between a spirit and a living person, which runs contrary to nature and will lead to the death of the person.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2015|p=780}}</ref> Although ghosts are not mentioned in the initial parts of the film, Japanese writer [[Kazushi Hosaka]] stated Mizoguchi foreshadowed it using the scenery, which suggests a detachment from real life. The scene where the protagonists cross [[Lake Biwa]] is an example, given the fogs that turn the film away from the ''[[jidaigeki]]'' genre.<ref>{{harvnb|Spicer|2010|p=236}}</ref> Professor [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] argues that the film's depiction of the main ghost character evolves from the mere demon of \"The Lust of the White Serpent\" into the more humane and tragic Lady Wakasa, and this makes the story more complex. Wood further opines the combination of the story with \"The House in the Thicket,\" combining the male protagonist of each tale into one character, Genj\u016br\u014d, also connects the demon character and the ghost wife. Both Lady Wakasa and Miyagi are killed by a male-dominated society, and both are wronged by Genj\u016br\u014d.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1998|p=243}}</ref> Wood believes ''Ugetsu'' can be considered a [[feminist film]] for its exploration of the negative impact of a patriarchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1998|p=245}}</ref>\n\nGenj\u016br\u014d's pottery is also a major theme in the film. Professor Wood argues his pottery evolves in three phases, reflecting Mizoguchi's changing approach to filmmaking.
