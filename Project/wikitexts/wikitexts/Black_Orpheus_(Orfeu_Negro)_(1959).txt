The film was an international co-production among [[production company|production companies]] in Brazil, France and Italy.\n\nThe film is particularly noted for its soundtrack by two Brazilian composers: [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]], whose song \"[[A felicidade]]\" opens the film; and [[Luiz Bonf\u00e1]], whose \"[[Manh\u00e3 de Carnaval]]\" and \"Samba de Orfeu\" have become classics of ''[[bossa nova]]''.

Eurydice ([[Marpessa Dawn]]) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a [[Tram|trolley]] driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina ([[L\u00e9a Garcia]]).\n\nAlthough engaged to Mira ([[Lourdes de Oliveira]]), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring.\n\nWhen Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man &ndash; Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume &ndash; finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed.\n\nOrfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a [[samba school]], one of many parading during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]]. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira.\n\nEventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydice's veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life first from Mira, then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu's own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to get away from Death and is killed accidentally by Orfeu when he turns the power on and electrocutes her. Death tells Orfeu \"Now she's mine,\" before knocking him out.\n\nDistraught, Orfeu looks for Eurydice at the Office of Missing Persons, although Hermes has told him she is dead. The building is deserted at night, with only a janitor sweeping up. He tells Orfeu that the place holds only papers and that no people can be found there. Taking pity on Orfeu, the janitor takes him down a large darkened spiral staircase &ndash; a reference to the mythical Orpheus' descent into the underworld &ndash; to a [[Macumba]] ritual, a regional form of the Afro-Brazilian religion [[Candombl\u00e9]].\n\nAt the gate, there is a dog named [[Cerberus]], after the three-headed dog of [[Hades]] in Greek mythology. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to lest he lose her forever. When he turns and looks anyway, he sees the old woman, and Eurydice's spirit departs, as in the Greek myth.\n\nOrfeu wanders in mourning. He retrieves Eurydice's body from the city morgue and carries her in his arms across town and up the hill toward his home, where his shack is burning. A vengeful Mira, running amok, flings a stone that hits him in the head and knocks him over a cliff to his death with Eurydice still in his arms.\n\nTwo children, Benedito and Zeca &ndash; who have followed Orfeu throughout the film &ndash; believe Orfeu's tale that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise every morning. After Orfeu's death, Benedito insists that Zeca pick up the guitar and play so that the sun will rise. Zeca plays, and the sun comes up. A little girl appears, gives Zeca a single flower, and the three children dance.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Orfeu Negro, 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster by [[Helmuth Ellgaard]] for the German release]]\n* [[Breno Mello]] as Orfeu\n* [[Marpessa Dawn]] as Eurydice\n* [[Marcel Camus]] as Ernesto\n* [[Fausto Guerzoni]] as Fausto\n* [[Lourdes de Oliveira]] as Mira\n* [[L\u00e9a Garcia]] as Serafina\n* [[Adhemar da Silva]] as Death\n* Alexandro Constantino as Hermes\n* Waldemar De Souza as Chico\n* Jorge Dos Santos as Benedito\n* Aurino Cassiano as Zeca\n\n'''Notes'''\n* Marpessa Dawn was not from Brazil, but from [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>{{IMDb name|0206026|Marpessa Dawn}}</ref>\n* Breno Mello was a [[soccer]] player with no acting experience at the time he was cast as Orfeu.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|title=Breno Mello, 76, Star of ''Orpheus'', Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/movies/06mello.html|access-date=25 February 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 September 2008}}</ref> Mello was walking on the street in Rio de Janeiro, when director Marcel Camus stopped him and asked if he would like to be in a film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guyot|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|title=Astro de ''Orfeu Negro'' conhece Cannes 46 anos apos vencer festival|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u50821.shtml|agency=Agence France-Presse|access-date=25 February 2012|date=17 May 2005}}</ref>\n* Da Silva, the actor who played Death, was a [[triple jump]]er who won two Olympic gold medals, in 1952 and 1956.<ref name=sports-reference>{{cite web|title=Adhemar da Silva|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/da/adhemar-da-silva-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417110330/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/da/adhemar-da-silva-1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 April 2020|website=sports-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|access-date=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n* The role of Zeca was played by Aurino Cassiano, a young musician from a large musical family.
