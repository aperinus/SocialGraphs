[[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all ships of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]. An army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. Within the Matrix, the lone ship's crew is encountered by the former [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]] [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who copies himself over the body of crew member [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] and uses the phone line to leave the Matrix.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' leaves Zion and enters the Matrix, where Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. The Oracle reveals that she is part of the Matrix and instructs Neo to reach its Source with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated by him, he became a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself over other inhabitants of the Matrix, including the new upgraded Agents. He tries to take over Neo's body but fails, prompting a battle between Neo and many copies of Smith. Neo defends himself, but is forced to retreat.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station to bypass a security system, which will allow Neo to enter the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, he asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\nThe ''Logos'' is successful, but the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, The Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker is killed after unlocking the door to the Source for Neo.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix, who explains that as the One, Neo is himself an intentional part of the design of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either reboot the Matrix from the Source and pick a handful of survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or go to save the imperiled Trinity, causing the Matrix to crash and killing everyone in it. Neo chooses the latter, prompting a dismissive response from the Architect.\n\nNeo's vision of Trinity comes true as she is shot by Agent Thompson while falling off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo arrives and catches her. He then removes the bullet from her chest and restarts her heart. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. As the Sentinels catch up to them, Neo realizes he is able to sense the machines in the real world, and telepathically destroys them but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain reveals that other ships defending Zion were wiped out by the machines after someone prematurely activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]. Only one survivor was found: the Smith-possessed Bane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith|Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as the [[Keymaker]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as the Merovingian\n* [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as the Architect\n* [[Nathaniel Lees]] as Captain Mifune\n* Neil and Adrian Rayment as the [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]]\n* [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as Agent Johnson\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Axel\n* [[Collin Chou]] as Seraph\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Zee\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Cas\n* Donald Anjaya Batte as Vector\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as Captain Ballard\n* David A.

Filming began on March 1, 2001 and ended on August 21, 2002, concurrently with the filming of the sequel, ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]''. The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration. However, producers decided against this as \"the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long\".<ref name=job>{{cite web |url=http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |title=Chasing the Stars: Carmakers in Movies |publisher=MSN.com |first=Ann |last=Job |access-date=2005-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306233023/http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=4021949&src=News |archive-date=March 6, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[General Motors]] was hired to donate over 300 cars to be used during production, destroying them for the sake of creating art.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorbiscuit.com/300-gm-cars-completely-destroyed-during-matrix-reloaded-highway-chase-scene/|title=Over 300 GM Cars Were Completely Destroyed During 'The Matrix Reloaded' Highway Chase Scene|date=March 10, 2022 }}</ref> ''[[MythBusters]]'' would later reuse the Alameda location in order to explore the effects of a head-on collision between two semi trucks, and to perform various other experiments.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | access-date=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether. The ESC team rendered the final effects using the program [[Mental Ray]].<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Matrix Reloaded: The Album|The Matrix Reloaded (score)}}\n[[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], who composed for ''The Matrix'', returned to score ''Reloaded''. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits.\n\nIt was originally planned for the electronic band [[R\u00f6yksopp]] to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.<ref>\"[http://www.fib.no/en/News-2015/Kafka-feat-Royksopp-at-the-Bergen-International-Festival/ Kafka feat.
