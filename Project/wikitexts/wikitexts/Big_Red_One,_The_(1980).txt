It was heavily cut on its original release, but a restored version, ''The Big Red One: The Reconstruction'', premi\u00e8red at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]], seven years after Fuller's death. Fuller wrote a book with the same title, which was more a companion novel than a [[novelization]] of the film, although it features many of the scenes that were originally cut.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:USArmy First Inf Patch.jpg|thumb|right|Patch of the United States Army's 1st Infantry Division]]\nFuller was a [[World War II]] veteran and served with the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], which is nicknamed \"The Big Red One\" for the red numeral \"1\" on the division's shoulder patch. He received the [[Silver Star]], [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], and [[Purple Heart]] during his service. He was present at the liberation of the [[Sokolov, Czech Republic|Falkenau concentration camp]].<ref name=\"Fuller, Samuel 2002\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[World War I]]: In November 1918, a [[United States Army]] private kills a surrendering [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] soldier with his [[trench knife]], thinking the surrender is a trick. When he returns to his company's headquarters, the private is told that [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|the war ended]] four hours earlier.\n\n[[World War II]]: In November 1942, the US soldier, now a sergeant in the \"Big Red One\", leads his squad of infantrymen through [[Operation Torch|North Africa]]; they are initially fired on by a [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] general, who is then overpowered by his French troops, who are loyal to [[Free France]]. Over the next two years, the squad is part of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], where they are given intelligence on the location of a [[Tiger I]] [[Heavy tank|tank]] and are fed by grateful Sicilian women; the landing on [[Omaha Beach]] at the start of the [[Normandy landings|Normandy campaign]]; the [[Operation Overlord|liberation of France]], where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum; and the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of western Germany]]. The sergeant's [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] counterpart, Schroeder, participates in many of these same battles, and at different times both he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers, but not murderers, though Schroeder also displays a ruthless loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nDuring the advance across northern [[France]], the American squad crosses the former WWI battlefield on which the sergeant killed the surrendering German, where a memorial now stands to the earlier war. Schroeder has sprinkled his own living men among the German dead from a recent battle at this location, but the sergeant senses a trap and checks out the bodies in a burned-out tank. Noticing that the piping on the German uniforms is not consistent, he silently kills the living Germans in the tank. Feigning orders from his commander on the radio, the sergeant begins leading his men away, quietly telling them that living Germans are about. One of his new recruits sees a German move and shoots him, setting off a skirmish in which the Americans wipe out the Germans with only minor injuries in their own ranks. While the sergeant's squad are patching up their wounded, a French couple arrives on a motorcycle and sidecar. The husband dies of his previous wounds, but not before begging the sergeant to help his pregnant wife. The squad clears the tank and puts the woman, who is in active labor, in the tank. After a somewhat comical series of attempts to help the mother give birth, a child is born. Schroeder takes advantage of all of this excitement to sneak away unharmed.\n\nThe squad's final action in the war is the liberation of [[Sokolov, Czech Republic#History|Falkenau]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], during which the American soldiers are shocked by what they witness. The sergeant befriends a young boy he finds in the concentration camp, but the boy dies that same afternoon. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night when Schroeder approaches him, attempting to surrender. The sergeant stabs Schroeder and then his squad arrives and informs him that [[Victory in Europe Day|the war in Europe ended]] four hours earlier. This time, as the squad walks away, Private Griff notices that Schroeder is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment. Private Zab, in [[voice-over]], remarks that he and his fellow American troops have more in common with this Nazi soldier, because they have all been through the war and survived, than they do with all of the replacements they may have fought alongside, but who are dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as the Sergeant\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as Private Griff\n* [[Robert Carradine]] as Private Zab\n* [[Bobby Di Cicco]] as Private Vinci\n* [[Kelly Ward]] as Private Johnson\n* [[Siegfried Rauch]] as [[Feldwebel]] Schroeder\n* [[Marthe Villalonga]] as Madame Marbaise\n* [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] as Walloon fighter\n* [[Perry Lang]] as Private Kaiser\n* Matteo Zoffoli as Matteo\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Warner Bros.]] was interested in filming ''The Big Red One'' in the late 1950s, sending Fuller on a trip to Europe to scout locations. Fuller directed ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]'' as a [[Dry Run (testing)|dry run]] for the film. When Fuller argued with [[Jack L. Warner]] and his studio over cuts they made to ''Merrill's Marauders'', the plans for ''The Big Red One'' were dropped.<ref name=\"Fuller, Samuel 2002\">Fuller, Samuel. ''A Third Face''. Alfred A. Knopf (2002)</ref>\n\nIn the project's early stages, at Jack L. Warner's urging, [[John Wayne]] was lined up to play the sergeant, but Fuller felt that he was not right for the role.<ref name=\"Fuller, Samuel 2002\"/>\n\n[[Peter Bogdanovich]] helped set up the film at Paramount Pictures, which paid Fuller to write a script. When Paramount head Frank Yablans left the studio, though, the project was put in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. It shifted over to Lorimar with Bogdanovich to produce (he says Fuller wanted him to play the Robert Carradine part), but then Bogdanovich pulled out and brought in [[Gene Corman]] to produce.<ref name=\"peter\">[http://www.nbrmp.org/features/PeterBogdanovich.cfm John Gallagher, \"Between Action and Cut\", August 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206113712/http://www.nbrmp.org/features/PeterBogdanovich.cfm |date=2012-12-06 }} accessed 3 June 2013</ref>\n\n=== The Reconstruction ===\nThe restored version, dubbed \"the Reconstruction\" and completed in 2004, adds 47 minutes to the film's running time, bringing it much closer to the form Fuller imagined before the studio took it away from him.<ref name=Crust /> Film critic [[Richard Schickel]] \u2014 who praised the 1980 version in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' when it was released{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} \u2014 took the lead on the restoration, which relied on footage found in an old Warner Bros. vault in Kansas City.
