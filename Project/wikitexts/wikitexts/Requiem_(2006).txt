It stars [[Sandra H\u00fcller]] as a woman with epilepsy, Michaela Klingler, believed by members of her church and herself to be possessed. The film steers clear of special effects or dramatic music and instead presents documentary-style film making, which focuses on Michaela's struggle to lead a normal life, trapped in a limbo which could either represent demonic possession or mental illness, focusing on the latter.\n\nThe film focuses on the medical condition ([[epilepsy]]) as seen in the real-life events of [[Anneliese Michel]], a German woman who was allegedly possessed by six or more demons and died in 1976.<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200559.html| title = What in God's Name?!|work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate =5 December 2016 | first=Eric T. | last=Hansen | date=4 September 2005}}</ref> These events also served as the basis of [[Scott Derrickson]]'s 2005 film ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]''.\n\nThe film was cast with Sandra H\u00fcller, Jens Harzer, Burghart Klau\u00dfner, Imogen Kogge, Irene Kugler, Johann Adam Oest, Walter Schmidinger, Eva L\u00f6bau, Anna Blomeier, and Nicholas Reinke.\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nIn the US, ''Requiem'' was released as a region 1 DVD in 2007.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Requiem |format=DVD (region 1) |date=March 6, 2007 |publisher=Genius Products |oclc=742540614}} English and Spanish subtitles.</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 35 reviews, and an average rating of 7.4/10.
