It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kevin Spacey]] and [[John C. McGinley]]. The film tells the story of retiring and dispirited [[Detective]] William Somerset (Freeman), who partners with Detective David Mills (Pitt) to hunt a [[serial killer]] who uses the [[seven deadly sins]] as his motives.\n\nThe screenplay was influenced by the time Walker spent in New York City trying to make it as a writer. Principal photography took place in [[Los Angeles]], with the last scene filmed near [[Lancaster, California]]. The film's budget was $33 million.\n\nReleased on September 22, 1995, by [[New Line Cinema]], ''Seven'' was the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, grossing over $327 million worldwide.<ref name=BOM /> It was well received by critics and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], losing to ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nSoon-to-retire Detective Lieutenant William Somerset is partnered with short-tempered but idealistic Detective David Mills, who has recently moved to an unnamed large city with his wife, Tracy.\n\nSomerset and Mills investigate a set of murders inspired by the [[seven deadly sins]]: a morbidly obese man forced to eat until his stomach burst, representing [[gluttony]], and a criminal defense attorney killed after being forced to cut [[a pound of flesh]] from himself, representing [[greed]]. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find a third victim, a drug dealer and [[Child molestation|child molester]], strapped to a bed, emaciated and barely alive, representing [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]. The third victim is in critical condition and unable to respond to Somerset and Mills' questioning. Daily photographs of the victim, taken over a year, show the crimes were planned far in advance.\n\nAfter forming a friendship with Somerset, Tracy confides to him that she is pregnant and has yet to tell Mills, as she is unhappy with the city and feels it is no place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes, having had a similar situation with his ex-girlfriend many years earlier, and advises her to tell Mills only if she plans to keep the child.\n\nThe detectives use library records to identify a [[John Doe]] and track him to his apartment. Doe flees, and Mills gives chase, during which Mills falls from a fire escape and injures his arm. Mills searches a truck before being struck with a tire iron. While Mills is incapacitated, Doe walks up and holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. The apartment contains hundreds of notebooks revealing Doe's [[psychopathy]], as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced by Doe at gunpoint to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made, bladed [[Strap-on dildo|strap-on]], representing [[lust]]. The following day, they attend the scene of a fifth victim, a model whose face has been mutilated by Doe; she was given the option to call for help and live disfigured or commit suicide by taking pills and chose the latter option, representing [[pride]].\n\nAs Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe unexpectedly turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim. Doe offers to confess to his crimes, but only on the condition that he escorts Somerset and Mills to a secret location where the victims representing [[envy]] and [[wrath]] are presumably buried; otherwise, he will [[Insanity defense|plead insanity]]. Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees. During the drive, Doe expresses his lack of remorse for his crimes, declaring that his victims deserved to die, and professes himself to be a [[martyr]] chosen by a [[God|higher power]] to shock the world out of its state of [[apathy]]. Doe also makes cryptic, threatening remarks towards Mills, who maintains his belief that Doe is simply insane.\n\nDoe's directions lead the detectives to a remote deserted location. Minutes after their arrival, a delivery van approaches. Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset intercepts the driver, who says he was instructed to deliver a box to their coordinates. Somerset opens the box and, in a sudden panic, tells Mills to stay back. Doe reveals that he himself represents the sin of envy, as he envies Mills' life with Tracy, and implies that the box contains Tracy's severed head. He goads Mills, telling him that Tracy begged for her life, and the life of her unborn child, and reacts with surprise and delight when he realizes Mills was unaware that Tracy was pregnant. Despite Somerset's warnings and his own initial hesitation, Mills eventually succumbs to his rage, shooting Doe fatally and repeatedly, fulfilling his role as wrath and completing Doe's plan. Somerset and the police captain watch as the devastated Mills is taken away. When the captain asks where he'll be, Somerset says he will be around, implying that he will not retire.\n\nIn a voiceover, Somerset says: \"[[Ernest Hemingway]] once wrote 'The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Detective]] David Mills\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Lieutenant#United States police forces|Detective Lieutenant]] William Somerset\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Tracy Mills\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Doe\n* [[R.

But when New Line sent David Fincher the screenplay to review for his interest in the project, they accidentally sent him the original screenplay with the head-in-the-box ending. At the time, Fincher had not read a script for a year and a half since the frustrating experience of making ''[[Alien 3]]''; he said, \"I thought I'd rather die of [[colon cancer]] than do another movie\".<ref name=\"Taubin\">{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |title=The Allure of Decay |work=[[Sight and Sound]] |page=24 |date=January 1996}}</ref> Fincher eventually agreed to direct ''Seven'' because he was drawn to the script, which he found to be a \"connect-the-dots movie that delivers about inhumanity. It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> He found it more a \"meditation on evil\" rather than a \"police procedural\".\n\nWhen New Line realized that they had sent Fincher the wrong draft, the President of Production, [[Michael De Luca]], met with Fincher and noted that there was internal pressure to retain the revised version; De Luca stated that if Fincher promised to direct the movie, they would be able to stay with the head-in-a-box ending.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript | title = David Fincher | first = Mark | last = Salisbury | date = January 18, 2009 | access-date= June 26, 2012 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> De Luca also said that he was confident that Fincher could still make a great film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/10/qa-social-networks-mike-de-luca-74797/|title=Q&A With 'Social Network's Mike De Luca|publisher=deadline.com|date=12 October 2010|access-date=18 October 2022}}</ref> Despite this, producer Kopelson refused to allow the film to include the head-in-a-box scene.<ref name=\"ending mottham\" /> Actor Pitt joined Fincher in arguing for keeping this original scene, noting that his previous film ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' had its emotional ending cut after negative feedback from test audiences, and refusing to do ''Seven'' unless the head-in-the-box scene remained.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\">{{Cite magazine | url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/09/16/brad-pitt-gwyneth-head-se7en/ | title = How Brad Pitt fought to keep Gwyneth's head in the box in 'Se7en' | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = September 16, 2011 | access-date= June 26, 2012 | first = Grady | last = Smith }}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot over a long period of 55 days. Fincher approached making ''Seven'' like a \"tiny [[Film genre|genre movie]], the kind of movie [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] might have made after ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.\" He worked with cinematographer [[Darius Khondji]] and adopted a simple approach to the camerawork, which was influenced by the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', \"how the camera is in the backseat peering over people's shoulder\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" /> Fincher allowed Walker on the set while filming for on-the-set rewrites.<ref name=\"Montesano\" /> According to the director, \"''Seven'' is the first time I got to carry through certain things about the camera&nbsp;\u2013 and about what movies are or can be\".<ref name=\"Taubin\" />\n\nThe crowded urban streets filled with noisy denizens and an oppressive rain that seems to fall without respite were integral parts of the film, as Fincher wanted to show a city that was \"dirty, violent, polluted, often depressing. Visually and stylistically, that's how we wanted to portray this world. Everything needed to be as authentic and raw as possible.\" To this end, Fincher turned to production designer [[Arthur Max]] to create a dismal world that often eerily mirrors its inhabitants. \"We created a setting that reflects the moral decay of the people in it\", says Max. \"Everything is falling apart, and nothing is working properly.\" The film's brooding, dark look was achieved through a chemical process called [[bleach bypass]], wherein the silver in the film stock was not completely removed, which in turn deepened the dark, shadowy images in the film and increased its overall tonal quality.\n\nThe 'head in a box' ending continued to worry the studio after filming was completed. After the first cut of the film was shown to the studio, they attempted to mitigate the bleakness of the ending by replacing Mills' wife's head with that of a dog, or by not having Mills fire on John Doe. However, both Fincher and Pitt continued to fight for the original ending.<ref name=\"pitt ending ew\" /> The final scenes of Mills being taken away and Somerset's quote from Ernest Hemingway were filmed by Fincher after initial filming was complete as a way to placate the studio (the original intention was for the film to suddenly end after Mills shot John Doe).<ref name=\"ending mottham\">{{cite book | title = The Sundance Kids: How the Mavericks Took Back Hollywood | first = James | last = Mottham | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] | isbn = 978-0-86547-967-8 | pages = 153\u2013155 }}</ref>\n\n=== Title sequence ===\nOriginally, Fincher planned the [[title sequence]] of the film to show Freeman's character buying a house in a remote country area and traveling back into the city. However, days before a [[test screening]], they had yet to film the sequence and had no budget to do it in that time. Fincher approached [[Kyle Cooper]] to suggest a replacement. Cooper recognized the amount of money used to make John Doe's notebooks (created by [[Clive Piercy]] and John Sabel),<ref name=\"artofthetitle2\" /> and used the sequence to display them in a slideshow set to a remix of [[Nine Inch Nails]]' \"[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]\", created by the band [[Coil (band)|Coil]].<ref name=\"artofthetitle2\">{{cite web | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/se7en/ | title = Se7en (1995) | first = Ben | last = Radatz | date = July 10, 2012 | access-date = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Art of the Title]] }}</ref> The hand-drawn credits font was used to suggest that Doe had written the credits himself.<ref name=\"empire title\">{{cite web | url = https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/david-fincher-fight-club-opening-credits/ | title = Anatomy Of An Opening Sequence: David Fincher's Seven | first = Phil | last = de Semlyen | date = October 9, 2015 | access-date = April 9, 2018 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] }}</ref> Spacey also requested to not be credited in the movie or promotional material so as to surprise the audience with the identity of the killer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brandi Yetzer |date=2021-10-17 |title='Se7en': Why Kevin Spacey Refused to Be Credited in the Film Opening |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/se7en-why-kevin-spacey-refused-to-be-credited-in-the-film-opening.html/ |access-date=2022-08-14 |website=Showbiz Cheat Sheet |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-total-film-interview-kevin-spacey/|title=The Total Film Interview - Kevin Spacey|publisher=gamesradar.com|date=1 December 2004|access-date=18 October 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe studio liked the sequence and suggested he stay with that. Fincher instead asked Cooper to \"pretend we've never met and come back and propose something else\", according to Cooper.<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Cooper came up with a more detailed version of this photographic sequence: \"The idea was that this is John Doe's job: he gets up, makes his books, plans his murders, drinks his tea.\"<ref name=\"empire title\" /> Fincher liked this approach, but cautioned Cooper, \"Well, that would be neat, but that's kind of a 2D glimpse.
