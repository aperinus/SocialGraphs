Under pressure from the mayor, Brigadier-General Treillard orders one of his officers, Lieutenant Armand d'Hubert of the [[:Fr:3e r\u00e9giment de hussards|3rd Hussars]], to place Feraud under house arrest. When d'Hubert delivers the order, Feraud takes it as a personal insult and challenges him to a duel. The result is inconclusive, as Feraud gets knocked unconscious before the fight ends. While trying to assist him, d'Hubert is attacked and facially scratched by Feraud's mistress. As a result of the fight, the general dismisses d'Hubert from his staff and returns him to active duty with his regiment.\n\n===Augsburg 1801 ===\nThe war interrupts the quarrel and the two do not meet again until six months later. Feraud challenges d'Hubert to another duel and seriously wounds him. While recovering, d'Hubert takes fencing lessons and in the next duel, the men fight to a bloody standstill. Soon afterwards, d'Hubert is relieved to learn he has been promoted to captain, as military discipline forbids officers of different ranks from duelling.\n\n===Lubeck 1806===\nD'Hubert starts serving in [[L\u00fcbeck]]. He is shocked to hear that the 7th Hussars have arrived in the city and that Feraud is now also a captain. Aware that in two weeks time he is to be promoted to major, d'Hubert attempts to slip away but fails to do it in time. Feraud challenges him to another duel. Before it, d'Hubert happens upon his former mistress Laura. She chastises him for continuing to duel Feraud, saying that he will eventually be killed, before bidding him a tearful farewell. In the encounter, d'Hubert slashes Feraud's forehead; with blood flowing into his eyes, Feraud can no longer see to fight. Considering himself the victor, d'Hubert leaves the field ebullient. Soon afterwards, Feraud's regiment is posted to Spain while d'Hubert remains stationed in Northern Europe.\n\n===Russia 1812===\nThe pair (both now colonels) chance upon each other during the French Army's [[retreat from Moscow]], but are forced to cooperate after being separated from the main force. Russian [[Cossack]]s attack, forcing d'Hubert and Feraud to fight together instead of against each other. After they have driven off the enemy, d'Hubert offers Feraud a celebratory drink from his flask, but Feraud silently turns and walks away.\n\n===Tours 1814===\nAfter [[Napoleon#Exile to Elba|Napoleon's exile to Elba]], d'Hubert is now a [[brigadier-general]] recovering from a wound at the home of his sister Leonie in [[Tours]]. She introduces him to Adele, the niece of her neighbour, and the couple fall in love. Colonel Perteley, a Bonapartist agent, attempts to recruit d'Hubert as rumours of Napoleon's imminent return from exile abound, but d'Hubert refuses. When Feraud, now a Bonapartist brigadier-general, learns this, he declares he always knew d'Hubert was a traitor.\n\n===Paris 1816===\n[[File:Napoleon sainthelene.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon on Saint Helena'' by Franz Josef Sandmann.]]After Napoleon is defeated at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], d'Hubert marries Adele and joins the army of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. Feraud is arrested and is expected to be executed for his part in the [[Hundred Days]] war. Learning of this, d'Hubert calls upon [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9|the Minister of Police]] and persuades him to spare Feraud. Not knowing d'Hubert saved him, Feraud is paroled to live under police supervision. Meanwhile, d'Hubert and Adele prepare for the birth of their first child.\n\nAfter learning of d'Hubert's promotion in the new French Army, Feraud sends two of his former officers to d'Hubert with a challenge for a [[flintlock pistol|pistol]] duel. Reluctantly, d'Hubert agrees. The two men meet in a ruined ch\u00e2teau, entering the woods from opposite sides. However, Feraud is tricked into discharging both his pistols and d'Hubert catches him at point blank range. Instead of shooting him, d'Hubert says that the [[Code duelo|rules of single combat]] dictate that he now owns Feraud's life. From now on, in all future dealings between them, Feraud must \"conduct [himself] as a dead man\". As such, he can never again challenge d'Hubert to a duel.\n\nWith that, d'Hubert returns to his life and happy marriage. Meanwhile, a solitary Feraud faces ending his days in provincial exile, locked away like his beloved Emperor, and unable to pursue the obsession of dueling that has consumed him for so many years.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Keith Carradine]] as Armand d'Hubert\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Gabriel Feraud\n* [[Albert Finney]] as [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]], Minister of Police\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Colonel Perteley, a Bonapartist agent\n* [[Cristina Raines]] as Adele, later d'Hubert's wife\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Brigadier-General [[Anne-Fran\u00e7ois-Charles Trelliard|Treillard]]\n* [[Tom Conti]] as Dr Jacquin, an army surgeon and friend of d'Hubert\n* [[John McEnery]] as Feraud's tall second in the final duel\n* [[Arthur Dignam]] as d'Hubert's one-eyed second in the final duel\n* [[Diana Quick]] as Laura, d'Hubert's mistress\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Lieutenant Lecourbe, a friend of d'Hubert\n* [[Maurice Colbourne]] as Feraud's second\n* [[Gay Hamilton]] as Feraud's mistress\n* [[Meg Wynn Owen]] as Leonie, d'Hubert's sister\n* [[Jenny Runacre]] as Madame de Lionne, a lady in Strasbourg\n* [[Alan Webb (actor)|Alan Webb]] as the Chevalier du Rivarol, Adele's uncle\n* [[Matthew Guinness]] as the Mayor of Strasbourg's nephew\n* [[Dave Hill (actor)|Dave Hill]] as [[Cuirassier]]\n* [[William Hobbs (choreographer)|William Hobbs]] as Swordsman\n* [[W.
