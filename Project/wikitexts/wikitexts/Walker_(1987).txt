The film is based on the life story of [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], the American [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]] who invaded and made himself president of [[Nicaragua]]. It was written by [[Rudy Wurlitzer]] and scored by [[Joe Strummer]], who has a small role as a member of Walker's army.\n\nThe film is intentionally full of [[postmodern]] [[anachronisms]], such as: [[helicopter]]s, [[Zippo]] lighters, automatic rifles, [[Diet Coke]], magazines and cars. It was filmed in Nicaragua, during the [[Contras|Contra War]] (1979-1990).<ref>[https://harvardfilmarchive.org/calendar/walker-2012-06 Walker - Harvard Film Archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/free-alex-cox-event-in-aberdeen/ Free Alex Cox event in Arberdeen|Den of Geek]</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Historical_Dictionary_of_Postmodernist_L/4QOyAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=postmodern+alex+cox&pg=PA346&printsec=frontcover Historical Dictionary of Postmodernist Literature and Theater - Google Books (pg.346)]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn 1853, soldier-of-fortune William Walker flees Mexico, after a failed attempt to incite an armed insurrection. He is placed on trial by US officials, but wins acquittal on breaking the [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Act]]. Walker is a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]] and has plans to marry and start a newspaper until his fianc\u00e9e Ellen Martin dies of [[cholera]]. Financed by American multimillionaire [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], Walker and 60 mercenaries embark on a mission to bring stability to [[Nicaragua]] by assisting the [[Democratic Party (Nicaragua)|Democratic Party]] in its civil war against the [[Legitimist Party (Nicaragua)|Legitimists]]. Doing so would secure Vanderbilt's rights over an overland shipping route between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nDespite significant losses, Walker and his corps score a bloody victory in Nicaragua, first in [[First Battle of Rivas|Rivas]] and then in the Conservative capital of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. In the midst of battle, Walker calmly strolls through the battlefield, seemingly unconcerned by the gunfire and death surrounding him. When the capital falls, Walker allows the President to stay in charge while the president's mistress, Do\u00f1a Yrena, seduces Walker. After discovering that the President is attempting to rally other countries in Central America to unite and repel the Americans, Walker orders the President executed for treason and assumes the presidency for himself via a rigged election. From 1855 to 1857, his actions as president become increasingly manic and delusional, with Walker antagonizing his financial backer by revoking Vanderbilt's license to the overland trade route and seizing his ships. When one of Walker's brothers challenges his authority, Walker kills him without hesitation. Cut off from supplies and reinforcements, he decides to introduce [[slavery]] to Nicaragua in an attempt to gain support among the Southern U.S. states, causing the African-American members of his legion to quit in protest. The situation continues to deteriorate as neighboring countries invade Nicaragua. Yrena returns and attempts to convince Walker to stop the carnage - when he refuses, she attempts to kill him, but fails and is forced to run away. Incensed, Walker instructs his men to burn down the town. Taking refuge in the church, Walker gives one final speech to his few remaining men and the Nicaraguan prisoners, telling them that the day will never come where America will leave Nicaragua alone, as it is America's [[Manifest Destiny|destiny]] to be there.\n\nAs Walker and his men exit the church, singing \"[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]\", a helicopter arrives filled with American troops clad in [[Present (time)|modern-day]] military gear. A man from the helicopter explains that he has been ordered by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to return all American citizens to their homeland. When he asks Walker what his nationality is, Walker replies \"I'm William Walker, President of the Republic of Nicaragua,\" so he is left behind. The movie ends with Walker being executed on the beach by Honduran soldiers.\n\nAs the credits roll, a television screen displays various clips of President [[Ronald Reagan]] discussing the presence of U.S. troops in Nicaragua, the U.S. military conducting \"training exercises\" off the coast of Nicaragua, and a woman washing the dead bodies of [[Contras]] victims.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ed Harris]] as [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]\n* [[Richard Masur]] as [[E.

He's a pretty bad guy. I didn't think it was possible to approach it in this normal, historical, respectful style.\"<ref name= \"gelder\"/>\n\nThe budget was set at six million dollars with most of the film being shot in [[Granada, Nicaragua]]. To get into character, Ed Harris led the entire cast in a 10-mile (16.1-km) forced march through the Nicaraguan countryside.<ref name= \"grove\"/> The actor was drawn to the challenge of playing someone \"who has incredible moral convictions but turns into such an evil person in the name of spreading democracy.\"<ref name= \"yakir\">Yakir, Dan. \"For Harris, The Appeal was Political\".

Both men, along with the Minister of Education, the country's Interior Minister, and a military commander, would occasionally visit the set. Two people were accidentally killed during principal photography, both in separate vehicular-related incidents. For one of the deaths, the movie company paid for the funeral and compensated the family. The shooting conditions were difficult because of all of the fires the locals were building, making the air thick and hard to breathe.<ref name= \"grove\"/>\n\nEven after filming was over, Cox stayed in Granada, editing the film. He said: \"I think we have kind of a duty not to just be the rich gringos and come down here and spend eight weeks and then disappear.\"<ref name= \"grove\"/>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nAs noted by Roger Ebert in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]:'' \"... anachronisms, guest stars, quixotic poker-faced heroes and utterly pointless scripts\", were the hallmark of films helmed by Cox.<ref>Ebert, Roger.

Retrieved: February 26, 2012.</ref> There are a number of intentional anachronisms placed to draw comparison between 1850s and 1980s Nicaragua. For example, the characters are shown reading ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and a computer monitor is visible in Vanderbilt's study. As the movie progresses, the inaccuracies become more and more extreme and it is evident that Cox was using the device to accentuate modern-day events with the Walker era.\n\nHistorical accuracy is done away with in a dramatic retelling of Walker's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. There is no evidence that Walker ever met Vanderbilt or received his support, as the movie suggests.<ref>Doubleday 1886, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref> Rather, Walker was supported by Vanderbilt's competitors, Charles Morgan and Cornelius Garrison, owners of the Nicaragua Transit Company in his time.<ref>Harrison 2004, p. 105.</ref> [[James Buchanan]] is incorrectly mentioned as being the President of the United States after Walker's trial, prior to his Nicaraguan expedition. [[Franklin Pierce]] was actually the president at the time. Ellen Martin, Walker's fianc\u00e9e, died in 1850. In the movie, she is present at his 1854 trial for violating US neutrality laws, after he invaded Baja California and Sonora Mexico, dying shortly thereafter.<ref>Harrison 2004, p. 176.</ref>\n\nMinor inconsistencies include use of bolt-action rifles, weapons from the [[World War I]] era, and Navy Colts in Walker's army, not in general use, until midway through the [[American Civil War]], almost a decade later, but it was obvious that Cox was little concerned with historical accuracy.<ref name=\"Kempley\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Walker (album)}}\nJoe Strummer had worked previously with Cox on ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'', contributing songs to their respective soundtracks.<ref name= \"dafoe\">Dafoe, Chris. \"Hollywood Knocks on Strummer's Door\".

They drew inspiration from local music played in bars \u2013 a mix of reggae, calypso and Brazilian music.<ref name= \"dafoe\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Walker'' originally garnered polarizing reviews.
