Along with Stallone reprising the title role, the film also stars [[Talia Shire]], [[Burt Young]], [[Carl Weathers]], [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Mr. T]]. In the film, [[Rocky Balboa]] faces stiff competition from [[Clubber Lang]], a powerful new contender, and turns to his old adversary [[Apollo Creed]] for training after the death of his manager and friend [[Mickey Goldmill]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began soon after the release of its predecessor. Stallone began a strict diet and workout regimen in preparation for ''Rocky III''. Despite the returns of the original cast being secured quickly, casting for Lang proved difficult, with real boxers [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Earnie Shavers]] attached to the project at various points. Mr. T was hired in 1981 after winning ''[[Games People Play (1980 TV series)|America's Best Bouncer]]'', and the film is considered his [[breakthrough role]]. ''Rocky III'' is the first film in the franchise not solely distributed by [[United Artists]], due to the company's merger with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1981.\n\n''Rocky III'' was theatrically released in the United States by [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.|MGM/UA]] on May 28, 1982. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for its action sequences and music but criticism for its screenplay, with some critics deeming the film unnecessary. ''Rocky III'' grossed $270 million worldwide, surpassing its predecessors to become the then-highest grossing film in the franchise, and the fourth [[1982 in film|highest grossing film of 1982]]. Its [[theme song]], \"[[Eye of the Tiger]]\", became a [[Hit song|hit single]] and received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. The sequel, ''[[Rocky IV]]'', was released in 1985.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1981, Three years after winning the world heavyweight championship against [[Apollo Creed]], [[Rocky Balboa]] has had a string of ten successful title defenses. His fame, wealth, and celebrity profile have increased, leading him to participate in an exhibition charity event against professional wrestler Thunderlips. Rocky's manager, Mickey Goldmill, worriedly eyes a young and powerful contender rapidly rising through the ranks, [[Clubber Lang|James \"Clubber\" Lang]]. While unveiling a statue of himself at the [[Rocky Steps|stairway by the Philadelphia Museum of Art]] just prior to announcing his retirement, Rocky is publicly challenged by Lang, now the number-one contender. Lang accuses Rocky of intentionally accepting challenges from lesser opponents and even makes a sexually suggestive comment toward Rocky's wife Adrian. A furious Rocky accepts Lang's challenge on the spot. However, Mickey initially wants no part of it.\n\nPressed by Rocky, Mickey confesses that he handpicked the opponents for Rocky's title defenses in order to spare him from another beating of the kind that Creed gave him in their rematch. He explains that Lang is young and powerful, and most of all he's \"hungry\"; by contrast Rocky is \"civilized\" and no longer has the stamina and strength to fight a boxer of Lang's caliber. Rocky, shattered by the realization that all of his fights have been stacked in his favor, convinces Mickey to work with him for one last fight. Despite his promise to Mickey to \"live in the gym\", Rocky insists on allowing the public to watch him train in a crowded hotel ballroom filled with distractions. In contrast, Lang trains alone with ruthless determination and vigor.\n\nLang and Rocky meet at Philadelphia's [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] on August 15, 1981. Pandemonium erupts backstage as Mickey is violently shoved by Lang, resulting in a fatal heart attack. Distraught, Rocky wants to call the match off, but Mickey urges him on while he receives medical care in the dressing room. Rocky's lack of preparation is worsened by his anger over Mickey, preventing him from fully concentrating on the fight. The match begins with Rocky pounding Lang with several huge blows looking for an early knockout, but Lang quickly recovers and takes charge, dominating Rocky and finishing him off with a haymaker left hook in the second round, winning the world heavyweight championship. After the match, Rocky tells a dying Mickey that the match ended in a second round knockout without saying who the victor was. Mickey dies right after he says \"I love ya, kid\". Rocky, lapsing into severe depression, mourns over Mickey's death.\n\nStopping by Mickey's closed gym, the forlorn Rocky encounters his former rival, Apollo Creed, who witnessed the match as a guest analyst. Creed offers to help train Rocky for a rematch against Lang in exchange for a future favor, which Rocky accepts. Apollo then takes Rocky to the gym where he once trained, Tough Gym in [[Los Angeles]]. Apollo quickly becomes frustrated by Rocky's lack of effort, as he is still haunted by nightmares of Lang and unable to train without Mickey by his side. However, Rocky regains his focus after Adrian helps him come to terms with Mickey's death. Apollo and his manager, Tony \"Duke\" Evers, infuse Rocky's undisciplined brawling style with more of Apollo's trademark footwork, skill and speed, rebuilding him into an entirely new fighter.\n\nAfter months of training, the rematch takes place at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. Apollo lends Rocky the American flag trunks that he wore during their first match. At the outset of the match, Rocky sprints from his corner, battering Lang with a level of skill and spirit that no one ever expected. Rocky completely dominates the first round, leaving Lang enraged and bewildered after the bell. Lang gains the upper hand in the second round, and Rocky adopts an entirely different strategy that angers and confuses Apollo by [[rope-a-dope|intentionally taking a beating from Lang]], even getting knocked down twice, all the while taunting Lang that he cannot knock him out. By the third round, Lang, who is used to winning matches swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds, loses his temper and starts throwing punches wildly as Rocky taunts him, gradually running out of stamina. With Lang rattled and vulnerable, Rocky strikes back with a flurry of punches, culminating in a brutal knockout to reclaim the heavyweight championship.\n\nAfterwards, Rocky fulfills Apollo's favor \u2014 a third, private rematch with him at Mighty Mick's Gym. The film concludes without showing the result,{{refn|group=N|In the 2015 film ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'', Rocky reveals that Apollo won the fight.}} but freezes into an oil painting of two boxers simultaneously throwing the first punch, showing two equally skilled athletes facing each other not as rivals, but as friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": the heavyweight champion of the world who continues to defend his title against other fighters. When Lang challenges Rocky and wins, the public cries for a rematch. As Rocky is reluctant following Mickey's death, former rival, Apollo Creed, befriends and trains The Italian Stallion in his preparation to take on Clubber Lang.\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and supporter throughout his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's best friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: The former Heavyweight Champion and Rocky's former arch-rival, who agrees to train him after the death of Mickey. In the process, the two become very close friends.\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill|Michael \"Mickey\" Goldmill]]: Rocky's friend, manager and trainer, who unexpectedly dies; a former bantamweight fighter from the 1920s and the owner of the boxing gym where Rocky trained for his first fight against Apollo.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo Creed's father figure, friend, trainer, and manager, who helps Apollo train Rocky.\n* [[Mr. T]] as [[Clubber Lang|James \"Clubber\" Lang]]: The underdog challenger who beats Rocky in a championship fight, amidst the unexpected death of Mickey. The public's general dislike and lack of respect for him as Heavyweight Champion of the World leads to a rematch with Rocky. Orphaned at an early age, Lang spent most of his childhood on the streets of Chicago's South Side as well as spending time in orphanages and juvenile facilities. As an adult, Clubber was sent to prison for five years for one count of a felony and/or assault charge. While serving his sentence, he discovered his talent as a boxer. Boxing was a way to let out his frustration, which leads to the events of ''Rocky III''.\n* [[Ina Fried]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Robert Balboa, Jr.|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa, Jr.]]: Rocky and Adrian's only child.\n* [[Hulk Hogan]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Thunderlips|\"Thunderlips\"]]: The current world wrestling champion, who fights Rocky in a charity event.\n\nIn addition to the main cast several others had [[cameo appearance]]s. Bill Baldwin and [[Stu Nahan]] returned as the fight commentators for the two Rocky-Lang fights. Veteran ring announcer [[Jimmy Lennon]] was the ring announcer for the first Lang fight, while boxing judge Marty Denkin was the referee. [[Lou Filippo]] returned for his third appearance as a referee during the second Lang fight. [[Dennis James]] (''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|Price Is Right]]'') and [[Jim Healy (sports commentator)|Jim Healy]] appeared as the commentators for the Rocky\u2013Thunderlips match, while [[LeRoy Neiman]] was the guest ring announcer. [[Jim Hill (American football)|Jim Hill]] was a TV announcer. A then unknown [[Morgan Freeman]] auditioned unsuccessfully for the role of Lang's trainer. Footage of Stallone's guest appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' was incorporated in the opening sequence, with [[Jim Henson]] dubbing [[Kermit the Frog]]'s announcement that the episode's guest was Rocky Balboa, rather than Stallone.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}\nFor the role of Clubber Lang, two real world-class heavyweight boxers were first considered: [[Joe Frazier]] and [[Earnie Shavers]]. Both were about the same height as Sylvester Stallone and had the powerful physique he was looking for, but, according to casting director Rhonda Young, Frazier had a stuttering problem, while Shavers had a high-pitched voice which would have undermined the character's menacing presence. After looking far and wide (even going to prisons in the hope of finding a suitable black antagonist), Rhonda Young stumbled upon a television program on NBC, ''[[Games People Play (1980 TV series)|America's Toughest Bouncer]]'', showcasing a sports competition, and was mesmerized by the winner's physical prowess as well as his charisma. She then called the producer, Dan Ohlmeyer, to ask him about \"the man with the mohawk\". It turned out that not only was Mr. T a perfect fit, but he also proved tremendously determined to give the best possible performance right from the first [[screen test]], for what would be his [[breakout role]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8uSM2YQoTA|title=Mr. T biography (1999) [starting from 08:40]|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2020-08-25|archive-date=2020-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128193351/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8uSM2YQoTA|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn preparation for film, Stallone claims to have got his [[body fat percentage]] down to his all-time low of 2.6% and weighed 155&nbsp;lbs. He stated that he ate only ten egg whites and a piece of toast a day, having a fruit every third day. His training consisted of a two-mile jog in the morning followed by two hours of weight training, a nap during the afternoon followed by 18 rounds of sparring, another weight training session, and finishing the day with a swim.<ref>Muscle &amp; Fitness, Sept, 2004 by Michael Berg</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Rocky III: Original Motion Picture Score\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Bill Conti]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 9, 1982<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insoundtrack.com/movie/rocky-iii-1982#:~:text=Rocky%20III%3A%20%28Music%20from%20the%20Motion%20Picture%29%20Soundtrack,in%20March%2009.%20Eye%20Of%20The%20Tiger%20Survivor |title=Rocky III soundtrack and songs list |date=22 June 2017 |access-date=2020-10-13 |archive-date=2020-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929164857/https://www.insoundtrack.com/movie/rocky-iii-1982#:~:text=Rocky%20III%3A%20%28Music%20from%20the%20Motion%20Picture%29%20Soundtrack,in%20March%2009.%20Eye%20Of%20The%20Tiger%20Survivor |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]], [[pop rock]]\n| length     = 32:00\n| label      = [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' soundtrack\n | type       = film\n | prev_title = [[Rocky II#Music|Rocky II]]\n | prev_year  = 1979\n | title      = Rocky III\n | year       = 1982\n | next_title = [[Rocky IV (soundtrack)|Rocky IV]]\n | next_year  = 1985\n}}{{Singles\n | name        = Rocky III\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Eye of the Tiger]]\n | single1date = May 31, 1982\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|1.5|5}}<ref name = \"Allmusic\">Alter, Ethan.

Claiming the statue was not \"art\" but rather a \"movie [[Theatrical property|prop]]\" the city considered various alternative locations and settled upon the front of the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in South Philadelphia. It was later returned to the Art Museum where it was used in the filming of ''[[Rocky V]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Hinds |first=Michael Decourcy |title=Love Gets in the Way as Rocky V Starts Filming |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/movies/love-gets-in-the-way-as-rocky-v-starts-filming.html |access-date=21 September 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 23, 1990 |archive-date=1 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001235608/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/movies/love-gets-in-the-way-as-rocky-v-starts-filming.html |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' and ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''.
