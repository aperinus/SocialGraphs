Goyer]]. It is a sequel to the 1994 [[film]] ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=4150|title=The Crow: City Of Angels|last=Smith|first=Adam|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=2015-10-21}}</ref> and the second installment in [[The Crow (franchise)|''The Crow'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], drug kingpin Judah Earl murders mechanic Ashe Corven and his eight-year-old son Danny after they witness a gang of Judah's henchmen murdering a fellow drug dealer, with his gang dumping Ashe and Danny's bodies into the harbor.\n\nSarah from ''The Crow'' is now an adult, working in a tattoo parlor by day and painting surreal images of death and resurrection in her apartment at night. She is haunted by disturbing dreams about Ashe and Danny. After a day's work in the tattoo parlor, Sarah is visited in her apartment by a large crow as she contemplates a ring that Eric Draven gave her.\n\nSarah follows the crow to the harbor at night on [[All Saints' Day]], and witnesses Ashe's resurrection and frantic escape from his watery grave before taking him to her apartment. When Sarah tells Ashe he is dead, he panics and runs screaming into the night, ending up at his own home, where he relives the final moments of his life.\n\nSarah arrives there to find Ashe brooding, and she explains that the Crow resurrected him so that he can exact revenge on the criminals who killed him and Danny. Guided by the crow, Ashe starts killing Judah's henchmen, one by one. Ashe first visits Spider-Monkey in a drug warehouse and interrogates him as to who else was involved in the murders before killing him by blowing up the building. Another of Judah's lackeys, Nemo, is spending the night at a [[Peep show#Pornographic shows|peeping booth]]. Ashe appears in the booth and kills him, leaving a doll stuffed in his pants and a paper crow in his mouth.\n\nJudah has employed a blind prophetess named Sybil who is able to ascertain Ashe's link to Sarah and to the crow that is the source of his powers. Judah captures Sarah in order to draw Ashe to him and steal his power.\n\nOne of the murderers, Kali, goes to Sarah's apartment to draw Ashe out. While battling her, Ashe realizes that Kali is the one who killed Danny; enraged, he throws her against a wall that breaks her leg, and then out a window to her death, leaving a crow-shaped blood pattern. Ashe then pursues Judah's right-hand-man, Curve, in a motorcycle chase. Ashe shoots Curve's motorcycle, which blows up and throws Curve onto the road. Ashe then drags Curve into the nearby river, leaving him to die as parishioners cast down flower petals in the shape of a crow.\n\nDuring the [[Day of the Dead]] festival, Judah captures the crow and impales its wings with knives before killing it. He then ingests the crow's blood, stealing Ashe's power. Suddenly mortal, Ashe nearly dies from the shock, but is revived after seeing a vision of Danny telling him to keep fighting. Ashe attempts to rescue Sarah by seeking out Judah in his lair, an abandoned church. Judah overpowers the weakened Ashe in the ensuing fight, tying a rope around him and savagely whipping him, intending to hang him.\n\nSarah rushes up and stabs Judah in the forehead, causing Judah to drop Ashe. Judah pulls out the knife and starts moving toward Ashe. When Sarah intervenes, Judah stabs her in the stomach. Ashe gets up and impales Judah on a metal pipe, which fails to kill him. Ashe calls upon a murder of crows that devour Judah. Sarah dies from her stab wound, a tableau reminiscent of a painting she completed earlier. Ashe returns to death, knowing that he can rest in peace with Sarah, and his son.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent P\u00e9rez]] as [[Crow (comics)#Ashe Corven|Ashe Corven / The Crow]]\n* [[Mia Kirshner]] as Sarah Mohr\n* [[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]] as Judah Earl\n* [[Thuy Trang]] as Kali (in her final film role)\n* [[Iggy Pop]] as \"Curve\"\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as \"Nemo\"\n* [[Vincent Castellanos]] as \"Spider Monkey\"\n* Eric Acosta as Danny Corven\n* [[Beverley Mitchell]] as Grace\n* [[Ian Dury]] as Noah\n* [[Tracey Ellis]] as Sybil\n* [[Alan Gelfant]] as Bassett\n* [[Kerry Rossall]] as Zeke\n* [[Deftones]] as Themselves\n\n==Music==\n{{main|The Crow: City of Angels (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Crow: City of Angels'' opened at number 1 at the U.S. and Canada box office grossing $9,785,111 during its opening weekend, a record for the [[Labor Day Weekend]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Crow' flies over weak B.O. field|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 9, 1996|page=10}}</ref> Its weekend accounted for 54.6% of its total gross.
