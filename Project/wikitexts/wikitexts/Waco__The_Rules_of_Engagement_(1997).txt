Later former [[CNN]] business news reporter Dan Gifford and his wife Amy Sommer Gifford came in as co-producers, supplying almost another one million dollars. Director [[William Gazecki]] joined McNulty in traveling the country to interview and film participants for the film.<ref>[[Susan Faludi]], ''[[Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man]]'', [[Harper Perennial]], 2000, p. 425-426, {{ISBN|0380720450}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe resultant film, with Dan Gifford narrating, combined FBI negotiation tapes, Davidian home videos, footage from Congressional hearings on Waco, and extensive interviews with Davidian survivors, representatives of law enforcement, independent investigators, scholars and scientists.
