First broadcast in the United States on March 16, 2003, ''Children of Dune'' is the sequel to the 2000 miniseries ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' (based on Herbert's 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''), and was produced by the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. ''Children of Dune'' and its predecessor are two of the three highest-rated programs ever to be broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.\nIn 2003, ''Children of Dune'' won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects]], and was nominated for three additional Emmys.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part One: Messiah===\nTwelve years have passed since [[Paul Atreides]] became Emperor at the end of ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' by seizing control of the planet [[Arrakis]] and forcing a union with the former Emperor's daughter, the [[Princess Irulan]]. Paul's [[Fremen]] armies have since launched several bloody jihads to solidify his position. Deposed Emperor [[Shaddam IV]] and the rest of his family are exiled to [[Salusa Secundus]], where his other daughter [[Wensicia|Princess Wensicia]] plots to restore [[House Corrino]] to power. The [[Bene Gesserit]], the [[Spacing Guild]] and the [[Tleilaxu]] also plot to overthrow Paul's reign, aided even by rebel Fremen, who hate how Paul's terraforming project is changing Arrakis and the traditional Fremen way of life. The Tleilaxu present Paul with a [[ghola]] in the likeness of his friend [[Duncan Idaho]], killed during the events of ''Dune'' but secretly conditioned to assassinate Paul when triggered by certain words.\n\nThough his [[Prophecy|prescient]] abilities reveal the dangers ahead, Paul allows the conspiracies to succeed to avoid even worse consequences. He is attacked with a type of [[nuclear weapon]] called a [[stone burner]] and blinded but still manages to \"see\" by following his prescient visions. Later, Paul's [[concubinage|concubine]] [[Chani (character)|Chani]] gives birth to twins at a Fremen [[sietch]] but dies soon afterward. In Paul's absence, his sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] purges the imperial city of the enemies of [[House Atreides]]. Paul says the words that trigger Duncan's conditioning but the trauma of potentially killing Paul breaks his programming and unlocks the memories of his original incarnation. The Tleilaxu [[Face Dancer]] [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]] offers this as proof that the Tleilaxu can bring Chani back to life if Paul agrees to their terms. Paul is tempted but the unique nature of the infants (who, like Alia, were \"[[pre-born]]\") allows him to see through the eyes of his son and kill Scytale. Following the Fremen tradition of abandoning the blind to the [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], Paul walks alone into the desert. His legacy secured, the twins and their future empire are left in the care of Alia.\n\n===Part Two: The Children===\nPaul's and Chani's children [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] are now young adults; Princess Irulan has protected their interests as her own. Now married to Duncan, Alia is still [[regent]] of Paul's empire and official guardian of the children. Irulan's sister Wensicia yearns for a return to power through her son, [[Farad'n]]. After a long absence, Paul and Alia's mother [[Lady Jessica]] arrives on Arrakis to visit her family but Alia fears that Jessica has resumed her allegiance to the Bene Gesserit and may be plotting against her. An individual known as \"The Preacher\" has surfaced in the capital, speaking against the decline of [[Muad'Dib]]'s religion into empty rituals; Alia resists having him killed because she shares the popular belief that he may be a returned Paul.\n\nAlia possesses the memories and personalities of her ancestors due to being [[pre-born]] but has trouble controlling them; her internal struggles against the assertive voices manifest themselves in the form of paranoia and self-destructive behavior. The persona of the evil Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], Alia's maternal grandfather whom she had killed, begins to influence her and threatens to overtake Alia's consciousness altogether. Jessica senses that Alia has become dangerous and advises Irulan to spirit Leto and Ghanima away to safety. Later, after an assassination attempt on her, Jessica seeks sanctuary with Fremen dissidents. Wearing clothes presented to them by Wensicia, the twins escape into the deep desert but are soon cornered in a deadly trap of her devising.\n\n===Part Three: The Golden Path===\nWensicia's plot to assassinate the Atreides heirs fails but provides Leto an opportunity to fake his death and buy time to overcome Alia, whose madness reaches its peak. Baron Harkonnen's grip on her consciousness strengthens and a civil war brews with the rebel Fremen. Leto returns from the deep desert, where he bonds himself with [[sandtrout]],  the larval form of Arrakis' sandworms, to acquire a partial [[carapace]] granting the superhuman speed, strength and invulnerability of the sandworms themselves.\n\nTo force the neutral Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] to lead the rebels, Duncan murders Alia's lover Javid in Stilgar's sietch. As he predicts, Stilgar kills him in revenge and comes out in opposition to Alia. Leto encounters the Preacher, whose identity as his father is revealed. Leto's prescient visions have convinced him that he must lead mankind along \"the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]\" to ensure humanity's ultimate survival. The Preacher / Muad'dib admits that he saw the same path with his own prescient vision but he refused to take it, horrified at the sacrifices it would entail for him and humanity. Leto is vindicated by pointing out to his father that he also saw this is the only possible path that avoids humanity's extinction.\n\nWith a [[political marriage]] arranged by Jessica between Ghanima and Wensicia's son Farad'n, the Corrino heir identifies his mother as the mastermind behind Leto's apparent death. Alia has Wensicia imprisoned but Ghanima accepts Farad'n's gesture as honest. With Stilgar's forces moving in, father and son return to the capital city of [[Arrakis#Cities and features|Arrakeen]], where the Preacher makes a final speech denouncing Alia, his own religion and is fatally stabbed by a rebel Fremen. Leto confronts Alia at Ghanima's wedding and defeats her. Alia then takes her own life, rather than be controlled by the Baron, and dies in her mother's arms. After handing Alia's water and his father's ring to Stilgar, Leto disappears into the desert. In the final scene, Ghanima tells Farad'n that while he will not be her husband due to politics, they may yet fall in love and how she pities her brother for the solitude and suffering he will endure in the millennia that he must live for the sake of humanity.\n\n==Main cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Rubinstein]] envisioned the complex material adapted in a miniseries format, as he had done previously with [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2003, \"I have found there's a wonderful marriage to be had between long, complicated books and the television mini-series. There are some books that just can't be squeezed into a two-hour movie.\" Around the same time Rubenstein was first developing the material, the Sci Fi Channel's president, [[Bonnie Hammer]], was spearheading a campaign for the channel to produce \"blockbuster miniseries on a regular basis\". ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' was the first in 2000, followed by ''[[Taken (miniseries)|Steven Spielberg's Taken]]'' in 2002, and ''Frank Herbert's Children of Dune'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica]]''  in 2003.<ref name=\"NYT Berger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/tv/cover-story-where-spice-of-life-is-the-vital-variety.html?|title=Cover Story: Where Spice of Life Is the Vital Variety |last=Berger |first=Warren |date=March 16, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nRubenstein called his two ''Dune'' miniseries \"science fiction for people who don't ordinarily like science fiction\" and suggested that \"the ''Dune'' saga tends to appeal to women in part because it features powerful female characters\". Actress Sarandon agreed, saying \"One of the reasons I always loved the books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules.\" She added that the ''Dune'' series \"is very apropos to some of what's going on in the world today. It's about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts.\" Sarandon said of portraying Wensicia, \"it's always fun to play a smart villain.\"<ref name=\"NYT Berger\"/>\n\n==Adaptation==\nAfter production completed on the first miniseries (and before its broadcast), the Sci Fi Channel contracted writer/director Harrison to write a sequel. Harrison's idea for the next installment was to combine Frank Herbert's subsequent novels, ''Dune Messiah'' and ''Children of Dune''. He has said in interviews that he believed both novels to be two parts of the same story, which essentially concludes the story of [[House Atreides]].<ref name=\"Cinescape\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Television&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=&obj_id=26343  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316172142/http://www.mania.com/dune-remaking-classic-novel_article_26343.html |archive-date=March 16, 2008  |title=''Dune'': Remaking the Classic Novel  |first=Steve |last=Fritz |website=Cinescape |date=December 4, 2000 |access-date=March 14, 2010}}</ref> The three-part, six-hour miniseries covers the bulk of the plot of ''Dune Messiah'' in the first installment, and adapts ''Children of Dune'' in the second and third parts.<ref name=\"Tor CoD\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2017/09/19/syfys-children-of-dune-miniseries-delivers-on-emotion-when-philosophy-falls-flat/|title=SyFy's ''Children of Dune'' Miniseries Delivers On Emotion When Philosophy Falls Flat|first=Emmet|last=Asher-Perrin|date=September 19, 2017|website=[[Tor.com]]|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n<!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Children of Dune (TV soundtrack)]] -->\nThe series' score, containing 36 tracks,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008NGHU/ Amazon.com: Children of Dune: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.duneinfo.com/cd/cd_cod.asp |title=Children of Dune Original Television Soundtrack -

Although the two never catfight, their ongoing struggle to rule the ''Dune'' dynasty gives this mini a real kick.\"<ref name=\"Variety CoD\"/> Observing that Sarandon and Krige were \"clearly relishing their roles\", Fries added that \"Sarandon makes a formidable enemy, while Krige, traditionally cast as the villain, proves she can work both sides of the moral fence.\"<ref name=\"Variety CoD\"/> McFarland concurred, writing \"[Sarandon's] princess may be the villain, cooking up deadly schemes, but we're right along with her in having a good time.\"<ref name=\"SPI CoD\"/> Stating that the acting \"is at best utilitarian, the universally attractive performers embody attributes, not people\", Wertheimer added:\n{{Blockquote|The exception is the piece's token movie star ...

Looking swell in slinky gowns and a collection of outer-space-deco headgear fitted with sensual silver antennas, Ms. Sarandon nearly winks into the camera.

But she's right; this is a hoot. Her mugging is part of the fun.<ref name=\"NYT Wertheimer\"/>}}\n\nWhile Fries continues that \"the mini picks up a great deal of charisma when McAvoy and Brooks come aboard as the next generation of the house of Atreides\" and that \"Amavia and Cox as the tortured Alia and the put-upon Irulan offer layered performances\", she also adds that \"Newman, as the sour Paul, sticks to just one note\".<ref name=\"Variety CoD\"/> McFarland writes, ''Children of Dune''{{'s}} only annoyance is in the cast's insistence upon inexpressive acting. Fear may be the mind killer, but in this show power serves emotional strychnine\u2014the more royal the character, the stiffer the expression.<ref name=\"SPI CoD\"/> Asher-Perrin cited several \"moments of perfect execution\", including Alia's death and the coded conversation between Irulan and Mohiam, and praised the costumes.<ref name=\"Tor CoD\"/> Fries also praised the miniseries' costumes and [[visual effects]],<ref name=\"Variety CoD\"/> and Wertheimer wrote, \"The best qualities of the earlier film are matched in its successor: the eye-filling vistas, the over-the-top sets and costumes, the nifty effects, all of them light years beyond standard made-for-television fare.\"<ref name=\"NYT Wertheimer\"/> McFarland agreed, writing \"What really keeps you engaged are Ernest Farino's special effects.
