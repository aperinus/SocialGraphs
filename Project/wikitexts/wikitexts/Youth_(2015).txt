It is the director's second English-language film, and stars [[Michael Caine]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] as best friends who reflect on their lives while holidaying in the [[Swiss Alps]]. It is a story of the eternal struggle between age and youth, the past and the future, life and death, commitment and betrayal. The cast also includes [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Paul Dano]], and [[Jane Fonda]].\n\nThe film premiered at the ''[[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]'', where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] and had a positive critical response. At the [[28th European Film Awards]], ''Youth'' won [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[European Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Sorrentino, and [[European Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Caine. It received one [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination: [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], for [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]]'s composition of \"[[Simple Song Number 3|Simple Song #3]]\". At the [[Golden Globe Awards]], Lang was also nominated along with Jane Fonda for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nSeptuagenarian best friends Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle are on vacation in the [[Swiss Alps]], staying at a luxury spa/resort in [[Davos Wiesen|Wiesen]]. Fred is a retired composer of classical music; at the hotel, he is approached by an emissary for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], conferring a knighthood and asking him to perform his popular piece \"Simple Song #3\" at [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]'s birthday concert. Fred turns down the offer, claiming he is not interested in performing any more \u2013 although he still composes pieces in his head when alone. Mick is a film director, and is working with a group of writers to develop the screenplay for his latest film, which he calls his \"testament\". Also with them is actor Jimmy Tree, who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only remembered for his role as a robot. The hotel is inhabited by other quirky individuals, including a young masseuse, an overweight [[Diego Maradona]], and [[Miss Universe]].\n\nFred and Mick reflect on their lives, admitting that their memories are fading and that they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter and assistant, Lena, is married to Mick's son, but the latter leaves her for pop star [[Paloma Faith]]. Lena stays at the resort and vents her anger at her father, who was always distant as she grew up. The emissary returns, and Lena cries as Fred explains that he won't perform \"Simple Song #3\" because the [[soprano]] part belongs only to his wife and she can no longer sing.\n\nMick completes his screenplay and is satisfied with it. The main role is written for aging diva Brenda Morel, who has starred in eleven of his previous films. Brenda surprises Mick by arriving at the resort, and telling him that she is taking a television role instead; cinema is the past, she says, and Mick hasn't made a good film in years. Disheartened, Mick commits suicide by jumping off a balcony in front of Fred. Fred decides to visit his wife for the first time in years. She is senile, and living at a [[care home]] in Venice. He then returns to the UK to conduct \"Simple Song #3\" in front of the Queen and Prince.\n\nInterspersed throughout the film are surreal sequences, including a levitating monk, an imagined Paloma Faith music video, Jimmy dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]], Fred conducting a field of cowbells, and Mick envisioning all his previous leading ladies on a mountaintop (including Brenda, in her new unglamorous TV role).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Fred Ballinger\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Mick Boyle\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Lena Ballinger\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Jimmy Tree\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Brenda Morel\n* Roly Serrano as [[Diego Maradona]]\n* [[Alex Macqueen]] as Queen's emissary\n* Ian Keir Attard as Queen's emissary assistant\n* [[Luna Mijovi\u0107]] as Young masseuse \n* [[Robert Seethaler]] as Luca Moroder\n* Tom Lipinski as Screenwriter in Love\n* [[Chloe Pirrie]] as Girl screenwriter\n* [[Alex Beckett (actor)|Alex Beckett]] as Intellectual screenwriter\n* Nate Dern as Funny screenwriter\n* Mark Gessner as Shy screenwriter\n* [[Ed Stoppard]] as Julian Boyle\n* [[Paloma Faith]] as herself\n* [[Mark Kozelek]] as himself\n* [[M\u0103d\u0103lina Diana Ghenea]] as [[Miss Universe]] Joyce Owens\n* [[Sumi Jo]] as herself\n* [[Viktoria Mullova]] as herself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cannes 2015 29.jpg|thumb|400px|Director and stars at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]].]]\n''Youth'' is Sorrentino's second English-language film and the follow-up to his Academy Award-winning film ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' (2013).<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|last1=Child|first1=Ben|title=Sorrentino's The Early Years stars Michael Caine as conductor compelled to perform for the Queen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/13/paolo-sorrentino-the-early-years-michael-caine-queen-rachel-weisz|access-date=20 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2014}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began in [[Flims]], Switzerland in May 2014.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lyman|first1=Eric|title=Paulo Sorrentino's 'The Early Years' Begins Shooting, Storyline Revealed|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paulo-sorrentinos-early-years-begins-703233|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=20 December 2014|date=5 May 2014}}</ref> The primary location was the [[Waldhaus Flims]], a 5-star hotel built in the nineteenth century, where the cast and crew all stayed while filming.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Yin and Yang of it All|url=http://www.janefonda.com/the-yin-and-yang-of-it-all/|website=Jane Fonda|date=8 June 2014|access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> Other scenes were filmed in [[Davos]], Switzerland, particularly in the Hotel Schatzalp (the location of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'').
