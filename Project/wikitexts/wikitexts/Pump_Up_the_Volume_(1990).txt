The film stars [[Christian Slater]], [[Scott Paulin]], [[Ellen Greene]], and [[Samantha Mathis]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[High school]] student Mark Hunter, who lives in a sleepy suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], starts an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[pirate radio]] station that broadcasts from his parents' basement and functions as his sole outlet for his teenage angst and aggression. His pirate station's theme song is \"[[Everybody Knows (Leonard Cohen song)|Everybody Knows]]\" by [[Leonard Cohen]] and there are glimpses of [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] by such alternative musicians as [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Ice-T]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Concrete Blonde]], [[Henry Rollins]], and [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]. By day, Mark is seen as a loner who has to force himself to be sociable around others; by night, he expresses his outsider views about the problems with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, his fellow students increasingly tune in to hear his show.\n\nNobody knows the true identity of \"Hard Harry\" or \"Happy Harry Hard-on,\" as Mark refers to himself until fellow student Nora De Niro locates and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to confront their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide\u2014at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an [[overachieving]] student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on.  She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.\n\nEventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal, Loretta Cresswood, has been expelling \"problem students,\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) to retain government funding.\n\nRealizing he has started something huge, Mark decides to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old [[Jeep]], creating a mobile transmitter so authorities can't triangulate his position. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the Jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and Mark, unable to fix it, decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As the pair are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \"talk hard.\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Mark Hunter\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as Nora De Niro\n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Marla Hunter\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as Brian Hunter\n* [[Cheryl Pollak]] as Paige Woodward\n* [[Annie Ross]] as Principal Loretta Creswood\n* [[Ahmet Zappa]] as Jaime\n* Billy Morrissette as Mazz Mazzilli\n* [[Seth Green]] as Joey\n* [[Robert Schenkkan]] as David Deaver, guidance counselor\n* [[Ellen Greene]] as Jan Emerson\n* [[Andy Romano]] as Mr. Murdock\n* [[Anthony Lucero]] as Malcolm Kaiser\n* [[Lala Sloatman]] as Janie\n* [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as Arthur Watts of the FCC\n\n==Production==\nAfter his film ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'', a new wave comedy, was taken away from him and re-edited, Allan Moyle retired from directing and began working on screenplays. One of them, about a teenager who runs his own pirate radio station for other teenagers, came to the attention of SC Entertainment, a [[Toronto]]-based company, and put into development.<ref name= \"Scott\">{{cite news |last= Scott |first= Jay |title= Festival of Festivals In Person |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= September 12, 1990 }}</ref> He was persuaded to direct his own screenplay. Moyle wrote it without a specific actor in mind but his development deal specified that the project would be canceled if a suitable actor could not be found. The director needed an actor who had to have \"glee, to be ineffably sweet and at the same time demonic.\"<ref name= \"Scott\"/> He initially wanted to cast [[John Cusack]], but Cusack turned down the role, as he didn't want to play another high school student following his role in ''[[Say Anything...]]''<ref name=\"ringer\">{{cite news |last1=Ducker |first1=Eric |title=Talk Hard: The Making of the Teen-Angst Classic 'Pump Up the Volume' |url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/8/21/21395032/making-of-pump-up-the-volume-30th-anniversary-christian-slater |access-date=16 September 2020 |publisher=The Ringer |date=21 August 2020}}</ref> [[Christian Slater]] met with Moyle and producer Sandy Stern and displayed all these qualities. Moyle has described the film's protagonist as an amalgam of [[Holden Caulfield]] and [[Lenny Bruce]]<ref name= \"Scott\"/> and the \"Hard Harry\" persona as a guy who \"has to get credibility as an outsider. As the last angry man on the planet, he has to use the foulest language he can think of. He even pretends to masturbate on the air. He's obsessed with sex and death.\"<ref name= \"Portman\"/> The school in the film, Hubert Humphrey High, was based on a [[Montreal]] high school where director Moyle's sister used to teach that, according to Moyle, had a principal \"who had a pact with the staff to enhance the credibility of the school scholastically at the expense of the students who were immigrants or culturally disabled in some way or another.\"<ref name= \"Portman\">{{cite news |last= Portman |first= Jamie |title= Movie Views Cruel World of Today's Teenage Angst |publisher= [[Toronto Star]] |date= August 22, 1990 }}</ref>\n\nSlater disagreed with Moyle who wanted to bring in a tap dance instructor to help orchestrate a scene that begins with \"Hard Harry\" faking masturbation on the air and ends with him breaking into a manic dance by himself. Slater wanted to do something more spontaneous based on his instincts.<ref name= \"Yakir\">{{cite news |last= Yakir |first= Dan |title= Christian Slater Incites the Passions of an Entire High School in ''Pump Up the Volume'' |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= October 2, 1990 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Pump Up the Volume'' failed to catch on at the box office. When it was released on August 24, 1990, in 799 theaters, it grossed [[USD]] $1.6 million in its opening weekend. It went on to make $11.5 million in North America.<ref name= \"boxoffice\">{{cite news | title = ''Pump Up the Volume'' | publisher = Box Office Mojo | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pumpupthevolume.htm | access-date = 2008-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics and is currently rated 79% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 39 reviews. In his review for the ''[[New York Times]]'', Stephen Holden wrote, \"Much like ''[[Heathers]]'', ''Pump Up the Volume'' doesn't know how to draw out its premise, once that premise has been thoroughly explored. As the film accelerates toward its conclusion, the strands of its clever plot are too hastily and perfunctorily resolved . . . Working within the confines of the teen-age genre film, however, ''Pump Up the Volume'' still succeeds in sounding a surprising number of honest, heartfelt notes\".<ref name= \"Holden\">{{cite news | last = Holden | first = Stephen | title = A Rebellious Teen-Ager Takes to the Airwaves | work = [[New York Times]] | date = August 22, 1990 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEED81231F931A1575BC0A966958260 | access-date = 2008-03-03 }}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the film's conclusion: \"the ending, though in part contrived, doesn't cop out\".<ref name= \"Clark\">{{cite news | last = Clark | first = Mike | title = Slater turbocharges an energetic ''Volume'' | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = August 22, 1990 }}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe movie won the Golden Space Needle Award at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], beating out the festival favorite, [[Denys Arcand]]'s ''[[Jesus of Montreal]].''
