Gary Gray]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Seth Green]], [[Mos Def]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. An American [[remake]] of the [[The Italian Job|1969 British film]], but with an original story, the plot follows a motley crew of thieves who plan to steal gold from a former associate who double-crossed them. Despite the shared title, the plot and characters of this film differ from those of its source material; Gray described the film as \"an homage to the original\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/421/421750p1.html |title=Gray's Got Game |author=Spence D. |date=2003-05-30 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=2008-10-10}}</ref>\n\nMost of the film was shot on location in [[Venice]] and [[Los Angeles]], where canals and streets, respectively, were temporarily shut down during [[principal photography]]. Distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], ''The Italian Job'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 30, 2003, and grossed over $176 million worldwide. Critical response was largely positive, with publications comparing it favorably to the original film while highlighting the action sequences, performances of the cast and humor. A sequel, ''The Brazilian Job'', was reportedly in development in 2004, but the sequel was subsequently cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Brazilian Job (found production material of cancelled sequel to 'The Italian Job'; 2005-2007) - The Lost Media Wiki |url=https://lostmediawiki.com/The_Brazilian_Job_(found_production_material_of_cancelled_sequel_to_%27The_Italian_Job%27;_2005-2007) |access-date=2022-09-19 |website=lostmediawiki.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nProfessional [[safecracker]] John Bridger's team is set to steal $35 million worth of [[gold bullion]] from a safe in [[Venice]] from Italian gangsters who had stolen it weeks earlier. Professional fixer Charlie Croker, [[computer hacker|computer expert]] Lyle or \"Napster\", [[Driving|wheelman]] Handsome Rob, inside man Steve, and explosives expert Left Ear comprise the team. Although the heist is successful, Steve double-crosses them as they drive towards Austria with the bullion. With another crew he takes it for himself and kills John. Rob drives the van over the bridge into the water to protect the others, using air tanks from the heist to stay alive. Steve leaves them for dead.\n\nA year later in [[Philadelphia]], Charlie finds Steve, under a new identity and is [[money laundering|laundering]] the gold through [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] jeweler Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe expert, offering her the chance to avenge her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguised as a cable technician, maps out its interior and determines the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. \n\nUnaware of Stella's identity, Steve asks her out on a date. The plan is to blow the safe while Steve is away on his supposed date, using three heavily modified [[Mini Cooper]]s to transport the gold out of the mansion. Supplier Skinny Pete gets the explosives and mechanic Wrench modifies the cars.\n\nOn Steve's last visit to Yevhen, Yevhen accidentally reveals that he knows about the Venice heist. To cover his tracks, Steve kills him. Mashkov, the leader of a Ukrainian [[crime family]] and Yehven's cousin, traces the gold back to Skinny Pete via Yevhen's ex-employee Vance.\n\nOn the night of the planned heist, the crew discovers that Steve's neighbors are having a party so they have to abort, as the explosives would draw attention. Stella still has to meet Steve, but inadvertently gives away her identity by using her dad's catchphrase. The team arrives to protect her, and Steve taunts them as he says he still has the upper hand. \n\nSteve plans to transport the gold to [[Mexico City]] by armored car to a private plane from [[LAX]] which Napster hears through his tap on his phone. Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system, forcing the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist.\n\nOn the day, they are surprised when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster determines which one carries the bullion and manipulates the traffic accordingly. As Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they maneuver the car to the target spot and detonating explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the subway tunnel below. \nOpening the truck, they find the gold in a different safe from the one that held it before. Struggling initially, Stella cracks it open and they divide the $27 million in gold among the three Coopers. They race from the subway to the [[LA River]] and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster creating a [[green wave]] to evade traffic. \n\nStella, Handsome Rob, and Left Ear head to Union Station, while Charlie lures Steve away in his helicopter. Steve tries to kill him by having his helicopter pilot destroy Charlie's Mini Cooper, but the helicopter's tail rotor is damaged, grounding it.\n\nSteve carjacks a [[Ford Bronco]] to follow Charlie to [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], where the cars are loaded onto a train car with the help of Wrench. He tries to bribe Wrench to let him in, but finds Charlie and the others waiting. When Steve pulls a gun, demanding the gold back, Mashkov and his armed men disarm him. Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection (it is implied that Skinny Pete put him in touch). \n\nStella punches Steve in the face as revenge. Mashkov then takes him away, implying he intends to not kill him, but rather torture him for killing Yevhen. The group boards the train as it departs to [[New Orleans]], and celebrate in John's honor. \n\nThe epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an [[Aston Martin Vanquish]], getting pulled over by a beautiful policewoman, Left Ear buys a mansion in [[Andalusia]] with a room for his shoe collection, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Charlie Croker, the team's leader and master thief.  He seeks revenge for the murder of his mentor, John Bridger.\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Stella Bridger, John's daughter and a professional [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]].

They viewed car commercials and magazine photographs, as well as chase sequences from ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002) as visual references.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Pfister wanted \"dark textures and undertones and strong contrast\"; he collaborated with production designer Charlie Wood on the color palette, and the two would confer with Gray on their ideas.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> This was Wally Pfister's first experience using the Super 35 format since Paramount preferred that the film not be shot in the [[anamorphic format]], despite Pfister's wishes to do so. However, Gray still wanted a widescreen [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], just like the origin, so they chose to shoot the film in [[Super 35]] for a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Once principal photography began, Gray frequently utilized [[Tracking shot|dollies]], as well as [[Steadicam]]s and a [[Technocrane]], to keep the cameras almost constantly moving.<ref name=\"Fisher\" />\n\nMost of ''The Italian Job'' was shot on location, at sites Pfister scouted over 12 weeks during pre-production, but some scenes were filmed on sets. The Venice building where the film's opening heist sequence takes place, the van from which the thieves survey Steve Frazelli's mansion, a hotel room, and the [[A Line (Los Angeles Metro)|LACMTA Red Line]] subway tunnel were sets constructed at [[Downey Studios]] in California. For the scene in which an armored truck falls through [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and into the subway tunnel below, Pfister set up seven cameras to capture the vehicle's ~{{convert|30|foot|m}} descent.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Three hundred cars were used to simulate the traffic jam at the intersection of [[Hollywood and Highland Center|Hollywood and Highland]], which was controlled by the production crew for a week.<ref name=\"Making\" /><ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Three of the 32 custom-built<ref name=\"Donaton\" /> Mini Coopers used during principal photography were fitted with electric motors since combustion engines were not allowed in the subway tunnels, where some scenes were shot.
