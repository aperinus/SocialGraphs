Nokosareta Ch\u014d-Senshi \u2022 Gohan to Torankusu|lead=yes}} is a TV special [[anime]] based on [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' [[manga]] series. Originally airing in [[Japan]] on February 24, 1993, between [[List of Dragon Ball Z episodes#Season 6: Cell Games Saga (1992\u201393)|episodes 175 and 176]], the special is based on an extra chapter of the manga series. It depicts the original post-apocalyptic future in which [[Goku]] dies from the heart virus and a teenage [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] tries to defeat Androids 17 and 18 (native name:\u4eba\u9020\u4eba\u9593), humanoid robots who were originally designed to murder Goku and his allies, before their immense destructive power destroys the Earth completely.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an [[alternate timeline]], two years after defeating [[Frieza]] and King Cold, Goku succumbs to a viral [[heart disease]]. Goku's death, being the result of natural causes, means that he can no longer be revived with the Dragon Balls. Six months later, [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Vegeta]], [[Krillin]], [[Tien Shinhan]], [[Yamcha]], and [[Chaotzu|Chiaotzu]] are killed by [[Android 17]] and [[Android 18]]. With the death of Piccolo, Earth's guardian, [[Kami (Dragon Ball)|Kami]], dies as well and the Dragon Balls are rendered permanently useless - making it impossible for anyone to be revived.\n\nThirteen years later, the androids terrorize the planet while the sole survivor of the battle, [[Gohan]], unsuccessfully attempts to stop them. He agrees to train [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], the teenage son of Vegeta and [[Bulma]], who is eager to help. Gohan attempts to provoke Trunks enough to trigger his transformation into a Super Saiyan so that they will stand a better chance, but all are unsuccessful. The androids attack an amusement park and Gohan challenges them once again. However, Gohan is overwhelmed and Trunks intervenes. Android 18 easily defeats Trunks requiring Gohan to protect him. As Gohan hides with his unconscious pupil in his arms, the androids, unable to find their targets, bombard the entire area with energy blasts and leave. The pair are nearly killed and Gohan gives Trunks his final healing Senzu bean in order to save his life. Trunks awakens to find that Gohan has lost his left arm and brings him home to Bulma who saves his life. Once healed, Gohan resumes Trunks' training.\n\nOne day, a huge explosion erupts within a nearby city. Gohan seemingly allows Trunks to join him, but renders him unconscious and departs alone. Gohan fights the androids but he is eventually overwhelmed and killed. Alerted by Gohan's energy signal suddenly vanishing, Trunks awakens and hurries into the city, where he finds Gohan's corpse. In his anger and grief, Trunks finally awakens his Super Saiyan transformation.\n\nThree years pass and Trunks assists Bulma with building a [[time machine]], when a warning on the television indicates that the androids are attacking a nearby city. Despite Bulma's warnings, Trunks confronts them but is easily defeated and nearly killed. He awakens in his house with his mother at his side, and finally decides that the time machine is their best hope to find a way to stop the androids. Once healed, Trunks prepares to depart with medicine to cure Goku's heart disease in hand. He travels twenty years into the past with the hopes of changing his future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese voice actor\n! colspan=\"2\" | English voice actor\n|-\n!<small>([[Funimation]]</small><small>, 2000 - original/2008 - remastered)</small>\n!<small>([[AB Groupe|AB Group]], {{circa|2003}})</small><ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon Ball Z: Big Green Dub Cast - Behind The Voice Actors|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|access-date=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''[[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]]'''\n| [[Takeshi Kusao]] (teen)<hr>[[Hiromi Tsuru]] (baby) || [[Eric Vale]] (teen)<hr>Stephanie Nadolny (baby) || Doug Rand (teen)<hr>Jodi Forrest (baby)\n|-\n| '''[[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]]'''\n| [[Masako Nozawa]] || [[Dameon Clarke]] (future)<hr>[[Stephanie Nadolny]] (child) || [[David Gasman]] (adult)<hr>Jodi Forrest (child)\n|-\n| '''[[List of Dragon Ball characters#Secondary characters|Android 17]]'''|| [[Shigeru Nakahara]]|| [[Chuck Huber]]|| Doug Rand\n|-\n| '''[[List of Dragon Ball characters#Secondary characters|Android 18]]'''|| [[Miki It\u014d]]|| [[Meredith McCoy]]|| Sharon Mann \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''[[Bulma]]'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Hiromi Tsuru]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Tiffany Vollmer]]\n!Bloomer\n|-\n| Sharon Mann\n|-\n| '''[[List of Dragon Ball characters#Secondary characters|Ox-King]]''' || [[Daisuke G\u014dri]] || [[Mark Britten]] (original)<hr>Kyle Hebert (re-dub) || Paul Bandey\n|-\n| '''[[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]]''' || [[Naoko Watanabe (voice actress)|Naoko Watanabe]] || [[Cynthia Cranz]] || Sharon Mann\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''[[Krillin]]'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Mayumi Tanaka]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Sonny Strait]]\n!Clearin\n|-\n| Sharon Mann\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''[[Vegeta]]'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ry\u014d Horikawa]]\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Christopher R.

The soundtrack also contained remixes of other songs.\n\n# [[Bootsy Collins]] with [[Buckethead]] - Shackler\n# Neck Down - Garden of Grace\n# Triprocket - [[Immigrant Song]]\n# Dream Theater - Regression\n# Dream Theater - Overture 1928\n# Dream Theater - Fatal Tragedy\n# Dream Theater - Through Her Eyes\n# Dream Theater - Home\n# Dream Theater - The Dance of Eternity\n# Dream Theater - Beyond This Life\n# [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] -  Prelude\n# Slaughter - Unknown Destination\n\nHowever, the TV special on Double Feature, there is an alternate audio track containing the English dub with original Japanese background music by [[Shunsuke Kikuchi]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[Anime News Network]]'s reviewer Chris Shepard stated: \"It is interesting... [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] are both understandable characters who I was really able to get into and sympathize for during their battles\" but also felt a \"good understanding of the happenings of the TV series is recommended\". He also felt that the action sequences were exceptional and did not \"overdo themselves\". He expressed some disappointment in the English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] as the storyline sounded \"completely alien\" to the Japanese subtitles. For his final grade he noted \"[the] Dub doesn't contain the original music... [it] isn't true to the original\" but was pleased overall.<ref name=\"Chris Shepard\">{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dbz-history-of-trunks-dvd|title=DVD Review by Chris Shepard: Dragon Ball Z The History of Trunks|publisher=Anime News Network|access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref>\n\nJohn Sinnott of DVDTalk praised the television special, seeing it as being separate from the other episodes of ''Dragon Ball''. He believed this to be a positive attribute. Regarding the Blu-ray release of the film he was less impressed with the color and [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], citing them as not particularly \"exciting\". However he expressed joy at [[Funimation Entertainment|Funimation]] leaving the original Japanese soundtrack and the English voice dubs in, describing them as \"enveloping\". For fans of ''Dragon Ball'' he recommended watching the episode as it \"worked a lot better than the average theatrical film since they follow ''DBZ'' continuity and expand the story while filling in details\". Like Shepard the Sinnott review advised those who are not familiar to the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise to avoid the episode but that fans will enjoy it. In conclusion he felt the film was enjoyable at best.<ref name=\"John Sinnott \">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34364/dragon-ball-z-the-history-of-trunks-bardock-father-of-goku/|title=Dragon Ball Z&nbsp;\u2014 The History of Trunks / Bardock: Father of Goku (Blu-ray|date=August 20, 2008|work=John Sinnott |publisher=DVDtalk.com |access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Releases==\nIt was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] in North America on October 24, 2000.
