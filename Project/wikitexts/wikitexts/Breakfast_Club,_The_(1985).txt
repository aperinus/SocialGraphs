It stars [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Paul Gleason]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], and [[Ally Sheedy]]. The film tells the story of five teenagers from different high school cliques who serve a Saturday [[Detention (Academia)|detention]] overseen by their authoritarian vice-principal.\n\n''The Breakfast Club'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on February 7, 1985, and was theatrically released by [[Universal Pictures]] on February 15, 1985. It grossed $51.5 million against a $1 million budget, and earned acclaim from critics, who consider it to be one of Hughes's most memorable and recognizable works. The media subsequently referred to the film's five main actors as members of a group called the \"[[Brat Pack]]\". In 2015, the film was digitally remastered and was re-screened in 430 theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Breakfast Club 30 |url=http://www.BreakfastClub30.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311040341/http://breakfastclub30.com/ |archive-date=December 6, 2019 |access-date=May 3, 2021 |publisher=BreakfastClub30.com}}</ref> \n\nIn 2016, ''The Breakfast Club'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/breakfast-club-rushmore-added-to-national-film-registry-w456002 |title='Breakfast Club,' 'Rushmore' Among Films Added to National Film Registry |author=Daniel Kreps |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=December 14, 2016 |access-date=December 21, 2017 |archive-date=December 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222053249/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/breakfast-club-rushmore-added-to-national-film-registry-w456002 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-film-registry-honors-breakfast-club-rushmore-and-other-teen-angst-movies/2016/12/13/824a7fbe-be58-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html |title=National Film Registry honors 'Breakfast Club,' 'Rushmore' and other teen angst movies |author=Michael O'Sullivan |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 14, 2016 |access-date=December 21, 2017 |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106064753/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-film-registry-honors-breakfast-club-rushmore-and-other-teen-angst-movies/2016/12/13/824a7fbe-be58-11e6-ac85-094a21c44abc_story.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=2012 National Film Registry Picks in A League of Their Own|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-12-226/cinematic-firsts-enshrined-in-2012-film-registry/2012-12-19/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=November 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126213632/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-12-226/cinematic-firsts-enshrined-in-2012-film-registry/2012-12-19/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191832/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- The plot summary should be 400\u2013700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nOn Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at Shermer High School report at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. for an all-day detention: nerdy Brian Johnson, varsity wrestler Andrew Clark, introverted outcast Allison Reynolds, popular snob Claire Standish, and rebellious delinquent John Bender. In voiceover, the five are described respectively as \"a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal\".\n\nThey gather in the school library, where Vice Principal Richard Vernon instructs them to not talk, move from their seats, or sleep until they are released at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. He assigns them a thousand-word essay, in which each must describe \"who you think you are.\" He leaves, returning only occasionally to check on and reprimand them.\n\nJohn ignores the rules and spends most of his time bullying or harassing Claire, Brian, and Andrew. They all eventually feel sorry for him after seeing how he deals with abusive adults like Vernon, who gives John eight weekends' worth of additional detention. At one point, the five sneak out of the library to retrieve John's [[marijuana]] stash; John allows himself to be apprehended by Vernon in order to give the others time to return to the library undetected. Vernon locks John in a storage closet as punishment, but he escapes and returns to the library by crawling through the ceiling panels. The others help John hide and cover for him when Vernon comes to investigate the noise created by John's escape.\n\nThe students pass the time by talking, arguing, listening to music, and smoking marijuana. Gradually, they open up and reveal their secrets and their poor relationships with their parents. Claire's popularity subjects her to intense [[peer pressure]], and her parents use her to get back at each other during arguments. She is in detention due to skipping school to go shopping; John's father is physically and verbally abusive and Vernon states that John is in detention for pulling a false fire alarm; Allison is a compulsive liar with neglectful parents and dreams of running away from home. Andrew admits that his father emotionally abuses him to get him to succeed in wrestling, leaving Andrew feeling unable to think for himself; he was sent to detention for taping another student's buttocks together, hoping to win his father's approval. Brian is under such pressure from his parents to get good grades that he contemplated suicide after getting an F in [[industrial arts|shop class]]; he was sent to detention for bringing a flare gun to school for that purpose. Allison claims that she wasn't actually sent to detention, and merely showed up for lack of anything better to do. They all realize that, despite their differences, they face similar problems.\n\nMeanwhile, Vernon complains to the janitor, Carl, that students today are less respectful than they were earlier in his teaching career. Carl tells Vernon that it is him that has changed, not the students.\n\nClaire gives Allison a [[makeover]], which sparks romantic interest from Andrew. Claire decides to break her \"pristine\" innocent appearance by kissing John. Although suspecting their new relationships will end when detention is over, they believe their mutual experiences will change the way they look at their peers.\n\nAs the detention nears its end, the group requests that Brian complete the assigned essay for everyone and John returns to the storage closet so Vernon thinks he never left. Brian leaves the essay in the library for Vernon to read after they leave. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, as do Claire and John. Allison rips Andrew's state championship patch from his jacket to keep and Claire gives John one of her diamond earrings.\n\nVernon reads the essay, in which Brian states that Vernon has already judged who they are using stereotypes, but \"each one of us is a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question?\" He signs the essay with \"Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Andrew Clark, an \"Athlete\" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for taping Larry Lester's butt cheeks together.\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Vice Principal Richard Vernon, the authoritarian vice-principal of Shermer High School who oversees the Saturday detention.\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Brian Johnson, a \"Brain\" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for bringing a flare gun that was to be used in his suicide attempt.\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Carl Reed, a janitor at Shermer High School.\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as John Bender, a \"Criminal\" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for pulling the fire alarm.\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Claire Standish, a \"Princess\" who was sentenced to Saturday detention for skipping school so that she can go shopping.\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Allison Reynolds, a \"Basket Case\" who wasn't sentenced to Saturday detention and only attended as she couldn't find anything better to do.\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Mr. Clark, the strict father of Andrew.\n* Mercedes Hall as Mrs. Johnson, the mother of Brian who pressures him to do well in his tests.\n* Mary Christian as Brian's sister.\n* Tim Gamble as Mr. Standish, the father of Claire.\n* Perry Crawford as Mr. Reynolds, the neglectful father of Allison.\n* Fran Gargano as Mrs. Reynolds, the neglectful mother of Allison.\n* [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] as Mr. Johnson (uncredited cameo), the father of Brian.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] both starred in Hughes's 1984 film ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''. Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them both to be in ''The Breakfast Club''. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson; his real life mother and sister playing the same roles in the film. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was \"really upset\" because she wanted to play Claire Standish (then named \"Cathy\" in the first draft of the script), which saw the auditions of [[Robin Wright]], [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Laura Dern]]. She eventually convinced Hughes and the studio to give her the part.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\"/> The role of Allison ultimately went to [[Ally Sheedy]].\n\n[[Emilio Estevez]] originally auditioned for the role of John Bender. However, when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clark, Estevez was recast. [[Nicolas Cage]] was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to [[John Cusack]] and [[Judd Nelson]]. Hughes originally cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look threatening enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed in Nelson because he stayed in character and harassed Ringwald off-camera, with the other actors having to convince Hughes to not fire him.<ref name=\"Itzkoff\">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=She Won't Forget About Him: Molly Ringwald Remembers John Hughes |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/she-wont-forget-about-him-molly-ringwald-remembers-john-hughes/ |date=September 17, 2010 |access-date=September 4, 2011 |archive-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813231509/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/she-wont-forget-about-him-molly-ringwald-remembers-john-hughes/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"wsj\"/>\n\n[[Rick Moranis]] was originally cast as the janitor but left due to creative differences and was replaced by [[John Kapelos]].<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

Hughes originally thought that ''The Breakfast Club'' would be his directorial debut. Hughes opted for an insular, largely one-room set and wrote about high school students, who would be played by younger actors.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 47.</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 28, 1984, and ended in May. Filming took place at [[Maine North High School]] in [[Des Plaines, Illinois]], which had been closed in May 1981. The same setting was used for interior scenes of Hughes's 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', which featured exterior shots from nearby [[Glenbrook North High School]]. The library at Maine North High School, considered too small for the film, prompted the crew to build a virtually identical but larger set in the school's gymnasium.<ref>Gora, Susannah (2010).

It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other. However, as the day rolls on, they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations.<ref name=\"Loukides\">{{cite book |last=Loukides |first=Paul |year=1996 |title=Beyond the Stars 5: Themes and Ideologies in American Popular Film |publisher=Popular Press |isbn=9780879727017 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 30\u201332] |url=https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/30 }}</ref><ref>Barsanti, Chris (2010).
