It was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. The film tells the story of a [[paleontologist]] in a number of predicaments involving a scatterbrained heiress and a [[leopard]] named Baby. The screenplay was adapted by [[Dudley Nichols]] and [[Hagar Wilde]] from a short story by Wilde which originally appeared in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' magazine on April 10, 1937.\n\nThe script was written specifically for Hepburn, and tailored to her personality. Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938, over schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed by uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by another cast member, vaudeville veteran [[Walter Catlett]]. A tame leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer stood off-screen with a whip for all of its scenes.\n\n''Bringing Up Baby'' was a commercial flop at release, although it eventually made a small profit after its re-release in the early 1940s. Shortly after the film's premiere, Hepburn was one of a group of actors labeled as \"[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]\" by the Independent Theatre Owners of America. Her career would not recover until ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' two years later. The film's reputation began to grow during the 1950s when it was shown on television.\n\nSince then, the film has gained acclaim from both critics and audiences for its zany antics and pratfalls, absurd situations and misunderstandings, perfect sense of comic timing, completely screwball cast, series of lunatic and hare-brained misadventures, disasters, light-hearted surprises and romantic comedy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bringing Up Baby (1938)|url = http://www.filmsite.org/brin.html|website = www.filmsite.org|access-date = February 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, ''Bringing Up Baby'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,\"<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|date=1990-10-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> and it has appeared on a number of [[list of films considered the best|greatest-films lists]], ranking 88th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|100 greatest American films of all time]] list.\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Huxley ([[Cary Grant]]) is a mild-mannered [[paleontologist]]. For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' but is missing one bone: the \"intercostal [[clavicle]].\"  Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow ([[Virginia Walker]]) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random ([[May Robson]]), who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum.\n\nThe day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) by chance on a golf course when she plays his ball. She is a free-spirited, somewhat scatterbrained, young lady, unfettered by logic. These qualities soon embroil David in several frustrating incidents.\n\nSusan's brother Mark has sent her a tame [[leopard]] named Baby (Nissa) from [[Brazil]]. Its tameness is helped by hearing the song \"[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby|I Can't Give You Anything But Love]]\". Susan thinks David is a [[zoologist]], and manipulates him into accompanying her in taking Baby to her farm in Connecticut. Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him, and she tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage.\n\nDavid's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George ([[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]]) takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, they let it out of its cage.\n\n[[File:Grant Hepburn Bringing up baby.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in adjacent jail cells|David and Susan in jail.]]\nDavid and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum ([[Walter Catlett]]), for acting strangely at the house of Dr. Fritz Lehman ([[Fritz Feld]]), where they had cornered the circus leopard, thinking it was Baby. When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the \"Leopard Gang\"; she calls herself \"Swingin' Door Susie,\" and David \"Jerry the Nipper.\"{{Efn|\"Jerry the Nipper\" was Irene Dunne's nickname for Grant's character in ''[[The Awful Truth]]'', which also featured Asta}}  Eventually, Alexander Peabody ([[George Irving (American actor)|George Irving]]) shows up to verify everyone's identity. Susan, who escaped out of a window during a police interview, unwittingly drags the highly irritated circus leopard into the jail. David saves her, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.\n\nSome time later, Susan finds David, who has been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high platform working on his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him. She tells David that her aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. They declare their love for each other, and Susan, distracted by the moment, unconsciously swings the ladder from side to side. As they talk, and the ladder sways more and more with each swing, Susan and David finally notice that Susan is in danger. Frightened, she climbs onto the skeleton, causing it to creak, and then collapse. David grabs her hand just as she falls, lifts her onto the platform, and halfheartedly complains about the loss of his years of work on his [[Brontosaurus]] as she talks him into forgiving her. Resigning himself to a future of chaos, David embraces and kisses Susan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Susan Vance\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Dr. David Huxley (alias Mr. Bone)\n* [[May Robson]] as Elizabeth Carlton Random, Susan's aunt\n* [[Charles Ruggles]] as Major Horace Applegate, a big-game hunter\n* [[Walter Catlett]] as Constable Slocum\n* [[Barry Fitzgerald]] as Aloysius Gogarty, Mrs. Random's gardener\n* [[Fritz Feld]] as Dr. Fritz Lehman, an affluent psychiatrist\n* [[Virginia Walker]] as Alice Swallow, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[George Irving (American actor)|George Irving]] as Alexander Peabody, Mrs. Random's lawyer\n* [[Leona Roberts]] as Hannah Gogarty, Aloysius's wife and Mrs. Random's servant\n* [[Tala Birell]] as Mrs. Lehman, Dr. Lehman's wife\n* [[John Kelly (actor, born 1901)|John Kelly]] as Elmer, Constable Slocum's assistant\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n'''Uncredited'''\n* [[D'Arcy Corrigan]] as Professor LaTouche\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Tom, the barkeeper\n* [[Billy Franey]] as the butcher\n* [[Dick Lane (TV announcer)|Dick Lane]] as the circus manager\n* [[Ward Bond]] as a motorcycle policeman\n* [[Jack Carson]] as a circus roustabout\n\n'''Animals'''\n* [[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]] as George, Mrs. Random's dog\n* Nissa as Baby and the circus leopard\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Hawks portrait crop.png|thumb|left|Director [[Howard Hawks]] began working on the film after plans to adapt ''[[Gunga Din]]'' were delayed.]]\nIn March 1937, Howard Hawks signed a contract at RKO for an adaptation of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Gunga Din]]'', which had been in pre-production since the previous fall. When RKO was unable to borrow [[Clark Gable]], [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Franchot Tone]] from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for the film and the adaptation of ''Gunga Din'' was delayed, Hawks began looking for a new project. In April 1937, he read a short story by [[Hagar Wilde]] in ''Collier's'' magazine called \"Bringing Up Baby\" and immediately wanted to make a film from it,{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=4}} remembering that it made him laugh out loud.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=175}} RKO bought the screen rights in June{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=5}} for $1,004, and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film's treatment.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=246}} Wilde's short story differed significantly from the film: David and Susan are engaged, he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur, intercostal clavicle or museum. However, Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby's favorite song, \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\".{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=5}}\n\nHawks then hired screenwriter [[Dudley Nichols]], best known for his work with director [[John Ford]], for the script. Wilde would develop the characters and comedic elements of the script, while Nichols would take care of the story and structure. Hawks worked with the two writers during summer 1937, and they came up with a 202-page script.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=247}} Wilde and Nichols wrote several drafts together, beginning a romantic relationship and co-authoring the [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] film ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' a few months later.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=5}} The ''Bringing Up Baby'' script underwent several changes, and at one point there was an elaborate pie fight, inspired by [[Mack Sennett]] films. Major Applegate had an assistant and food taster named Ali (which was intended to be played by [[Mischa Auer]]), but this character was replaced with Aloysius Gogarty. The script's final draft had several scenes in the middle of the film in which David and Susan declare their love for each other which Hawks cut  during production.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=6}}\n\nNichols was instructed to write the film for Hepburn, with whom he had worked on John Ford's ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936).{{sfn|Leaming|1995|p=348}} Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the characteristics of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford.{{sfn|Leaming|1995|pp=348\u2013349}} Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the [[John Ford Stock Company]] as [[Ward Bond]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[D'Arcy Corrigan]] and associate producer [[Cliff Reid]].{{sfn|Leaming|1995|pp=348\u20139}} John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.{{sfn|Leaming|1995|p=349}}\n\nFilming was scheduled to begin on September 1, 1937 and wrap on October 31, but was delayed for several reasons. Production had to wait until mid-September to clear the rights for \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby\" for $1,000. In August, Hawks hired gag writers [[Robert A. McGowan|Robert McGowan]] and [[Gertrude Purcell]]{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=29}} for uncredited script rewrites, and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip ''[[Harold Knerr#Dinglehoofer und His Dog Adolph|Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog]]'' in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=6}} RKO paid [[King Features]] $1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}}\n\n====Unscripted ad-lib by Grant====\nIt has been debated whether ''Bringing Up Baby'' is the first fictional work (apart from [[pornography]]) to use the word ''[[gay]]'' in a [[homosexual]] context.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/censored/film.html |title=Censored Films and Television at University of Virginia online |publisher=University of Virginia Library |access-date=March 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003143835/http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/censored/film.html# |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Boswell|2009|p=43}} In one scene, Cary Grant's character is wearing a woman's [[Marabou (fashion)|marabou]]-trimmed [[n\u00e9glig\u00e9e]]; when asked why, he replies exasperatedly \"Because I just went gay all of a sudden!\" (leaping into the air at the word ''gay''). As the term ''gay'' was not familiar to the general public until the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969,{{sfn|Russo|1987|p=47}} it is questioned whether the word is used by Grant in its original sense (meaning \"happy\")<ref name=\"Gay\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gay |last=Harper |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Harper |title=Gay |work=Online Etymology dictionary |date=2001\u20132013 }}</ref> or is an intentional, joking reference to homosexuality.<ref name=\"Gay\"/>\n\nThe line in the film was an [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] by Grant, and was not in the script.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=8}} According to [[Vito Russo]] in ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' (1981, revised 1987), the script originally had Grant's character say \"I...I suppose you think it's odd, my wearing this. I realize it looks odd...I don't usually...I mean, I don't own one of these\". Russo suggests that this indicates that people in [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] (at least in Grant's circles) were familiar with the slang connotations of the word; however, neither Grant nor anyone involved in the film suggested this.{{sfn|Russo|1987|p=47}}\n\nThe 1933 film ''[[My Weakness (film)|My Weakness]]'' had previously used the word \"gay\" as an overt descriptor of homosexuality; one of two men pining away for the same woman suddenly suggests a solution to their mutual problem: \"Let's be gay!\"  However, the [[Studio Relations Committee]] censors decreed that the line was too risqu\u00e9 and had to be muffled.<ref>Vieira, Mark A., Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood, Abrams, 1999, pg. 133</ref>  The film ''[[This Side of Heaven]]'' (1934) included a scene in which a fussy, gossipy interior decorator tries to sell a floral fabric pattern to a customer, who knowingly replies, \"It strikes me as a bit too gay.\"<ref>Vieira, Mark A., Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood, Abrams, 1999, pg. 168</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Bringing up baby film still.jpg|thumb|alt=Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant (in round glasses), looking off-screen|Hepburn and Grant in their second of four film collaborations]]\nAfter briefly considering Hawks' cousin [[Carole Lombard]] for the role of Susan Vance, producers chose Katharine Hepburn to play the wealthy New Englander because of her background and similarities to the character. RKO agreed to the casting, but had reservations because of Hepburn's salary and lack of box-office success for several years.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=247}} Producer Lou Lusty said, \"You couldn't even break even, if a Hepburn show cost eight hundred grand.\"{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}} At first, Hawks and producer [[Pandro S. Berman]] could not agree on whom to cast in the role of David Huxley. Hawks initially wanted silent-film comedian [[Harold Lloyd]]; Berman rejected Lloyd and [[Ronald Colman]], offering the role to [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], [[Fredric March]] and [[Ray Milland]] (all of whom turned it down).{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nHawks' friend [[Howard Hughes]] finally suggested Cary Grant for the role.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=174}} Grant had just finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937),{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=247}} and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}} Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|pp=176\u2013177}} Grant was concerned about being able to play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=178}} Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=178}}\n\nHawks obtained character actors [[Charlie Ruggles]] on loan from [[Paramount Pictures]] for Major Horace Applegate and Barry Fitzgerald on loan from [[The Mary Pickford Corporation]] to play gardener Aloysius Gogarty.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=247}} Hawks cast Virginia Walker as Alice Swallow, David's fianc\u00e9e; Walker was under contract to him and later married his brother [[William Hawks]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=248}} As Hawks could not find a panther that would work for the film, Baby was changed to a leopard so they could cast the trained leopard Nissa, who had worked in films for eight years, making several B-movies.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}}\n\n===Filming===\nShooting began September 23, 1937, and was scheduled to end November 20, 1937,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=254}} on a budget of $767,676.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=250}} Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the [[Bel Air Country Club]] in early October for the golf-course scenes.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}} The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be funny,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=250}} and Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing her that he was funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself for the rest of the shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=250\u2013251}}{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=261}}\n\n[[File:Bringing up baby publicity photo.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Katharine Hepburn, smiling, and leopard looking off-camera|Katharine Hepburn and Nissa in a publicity photo; at one point, Nissa lunged at Hepburn and was only stopped by the trainer's whip.]]\n\nMost shooting was done at the Arthur Ranch in the San Fernando Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=7}} Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot,{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=8}} Grant and Hepburn often [[ad-lib]]bed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=251}} The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=252}} After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four different versions of the film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=8}} His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the lost time.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=252}}  He took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=8}} Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and having to work with two animal actors.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=252}}\n\nThe terrier George was played by Skippy, known as Asta in [[The Thin Man (film series)|''The Thin Man'' film series]] and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in ''[[The Awful Truth]]''. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both played by a trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was supervised by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing her skirt to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon his fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=252}} There were several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming the live leopard, and the potential danger to highly valuable actors, so some scenes required [[Rear projection effect|rear-screen projection]],<ref name=\"Baby DVD. Special Features 2005\">''Bringing Up Baby'' DVD. Special Features. Peter Bogdanovich Audio Commentary. Turner Home Entertainment. 2005.</ref> while several others were shot using [[Matte (filmmaking)|traveling mattes]]. In a scene where Grant has Baby on a leash, it is quite obvious that the leash was hand painted on film because it proved impossible to make the two parts of the leash join in the traveling matte.\n\nHawks and Hepburn had a confrontation one day during shooting. While Hepburn was chatting with a crew member, Hawks yelled \"Quiet!\" until the only person still talking was Hepburn. When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her, she asked what was the matter. Hawks asked her if she was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk to her like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an even older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech whom he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling \"Quiet!\", was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=261}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=253}}\n\nThe Westlake Street set was shot at 20th Century Fox Studios.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=29}} Filming was eventually completed on January 6, 1938 with the scenes outside Mr. Peabody's house. RKO producers expressed concern about the film's delays and expense, coming in 40 days over schedule and $330,000 over budget, and also disliked Grant's glasses and Hepburn's hair.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=253}} The film's final cost was $1,096,796.23, primarily due to overtime clauses in Hawks', Grant's and Hepburn's contracts.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=254}} The film's cost for sets and props was only $5,000 over budget, but all actors (including Nissa and Skippy) were paid approximately double their initial salaries. Hepburn's salary rose from $72,500 to $121,680.50, Grant's salary from $75,000 to $123,437.50 and Hawks' salary from $88,046.25 to $202,500. The director received an additional $40,000 to terminate his RKO contract on March 21, 1938.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=14}}\n\n===Post-production and previews===\nHawks' editor, George Hively, cut the film during production and the final prints were made a few days after shooting ended.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=254}} The first cut of the film (10,150 feet long){{sfn|Mast|1988|p=12}} was sent to the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hayes Office]] in mid-January.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=13}} Despite several [[double entendre]]s and sexual references it passed the film,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=254}} overlooking Grant saying he \"went gay\" or Hepburn's reference to George urinating. The censor's only objections were to the scene where Hepburn's dress is torn, and references to politicians (such as [[Al Smith]] and [[James Farley|Jim Farley]]).{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=13}}\n\nLike all Hawks' comedies, the film is fast paced (despite being filmed primarily in long medium shots, with little cross-cutting). Hawks told [[Peter Bogdanovich]], \"You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast\".<ref name=\"Baby DVD. Special Features 2005\"/>\n\nBy February 18, the film had been cut to 9,204 feet.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=13}} It had two advance previews in January 1938, where it received either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards.

The film's concept was described by philosopher [[Stanley Cavell]] as a \"definitive achievement in the history of the art of film.\"{{sfn|Cavell|1981|p=1}} Cavell noted that ''Bringing Up Baby'' was made in a tradition of romantic comedy with inspiration from ancient Rome and Shakespeare.{{sfn|Mast|1988|p=3}} Shakespeare's ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''[[As You Like It]]'' have been cited in particular as influences on the film and the screwball comedy in general, with their \"haughty, self-sufficient men, strong women and fierce combat of words and wit.\"{{sfn|Carr|2002|p=48}} Hepburn's character has been cited as an early example of the [[Manic Pixie Dream Girl]] film archetype.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Donna |last2=Gillette |first2=Amelie |last3=Hyden |first3=Steven |last4=Murray |first4=Noel |last5=Pierce |first5=Leonard |last6=Rabin |first6=Nathan |date=August 4, 2008 |title= Wild things: 16 films featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls |work=[[The A.V.

In a rebuttal of fellow ''New York Times'' critic Nugent's scathing review of the film at the time of release, [[A. O. Scott]] has said that you'll \"find yourself amazed at its freshness, its vigor, and its brilliance-qualities undiminished after sixty-five years, and likely to withstand repeated viewings.\"{{sfn|Laham|2009|p=29}} [[Leonard Maltin]] stated that it is now \"considered the definitive screwball comedy, and one of the fastest, funniest films ever made; grand performances by all.\"{{sfn|Laham|2009|p=29}}\n\n''Bringing Up Baby'' has been adapted several times. Hawks recycled the nightclub scene in which Hepburn's dress is torn and Grant walks behind her in the comedy ''[[Man's Favorite Sport]]'' (1964). Peter Bogdanovich's film  ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972), starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Ryan O'Neal]], was intended as an homage to the film, and has contributed to its reputation.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=256}} In the commentary track for ''Bringing Up Baby'', Bogdanovich discusses how the coat-ripping scene in ''What's Up, Doc?'' was based on the scene in which Grant's coat and Hepburn's dress are torn in ''Bringing Up Baby''.<ref name=\"Baby DVD.
