It was directed by Burnham and [[Christopher Storer|Chris Storer]] and a recording of the show was released on [[Netflix]] on June 3, 2016. Similar to Burnham's previous special ''[[what.]]'', the show is a specifically choreographed performance that combines comedy with music and uses pre-recorded music, stage lighting effects, and sound effects. It has received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, with several critics complimenting Burnham's deconstruction of various types of performances, clever jokes based on misdirection, and his stage persona.\n\n==Background==\nBurnham rose to fame at the age of 16 after posting videos on [[YouTube]] beginning in 2006. He signed to [[Comedy Central Records]] and released his debut EP, \"[[Bo Fo Sho]]\", in 2008. His most recent work at the time of ''Make Happy'' was the stand-up show ''[[what.]]'', with which he toured in 2013 and released on YouTube and [[Netflix]] for free in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/bo-burnhams-what-released-today-on-netflix-and-youtube-together/|title=BO BURNHAM\u2019S WHAT.

The show begins with a song based around [[call and response]], where Burnham requests various groups in the audience (for example, virgins) to shout out \"Hell, yeah!\" After this song, Burnham immediately segues into a more introspective and meta song.\n\nFollowing this, Burnham moves to his keyboard and performs an ironic and satirical song about the problems of being a straight white male, and then delivers a comedic monologue on the subject of race, in which he tricks the audience into shouting the N word. As Bo begins to change the subject, a pre-recorded song interrupts him, calling him a \"faggot\", and continuing to call him a \"fucking faggot\" until he demands that the track be stopped. Burnham segues into a discussion of [[hip hop music]], in which he claims you can perform any song and add a 'sick beat' to it, and delivers a hip-hop version of \"[[I'm a Little Teapot]]\" and \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\" to illustrate his point. Following a series of subversive jokes based around misdirection, Burnham claims he will improvise a song about a member of the audience, and asks an audience member for his name\u2014Rob. A pre-recorded track plays about Bo having sex with someone's mother, and he inserts the name \"Rob\" into the gaps in the track. Burnham then starts talking about [[country music]] and criticising the modern-day industry, singing a mock country song about rich country singers pandering to their audiences.\n\nAfter criticising the lip-syncing segment of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Burnham performs a [[mime]] about seeing a penis in a restroom and then a song about love, where he advocates for people lowering their expectations when looking for a partner. He makes some quick-fire jokes and then performs further mimes about making sandwiches while high on marijuana, and intoxicated. Following from a fake advert for [[Flamin' Hot Cheetos]], he presents a song where he tells the listener to kill themselves, explaining before, during and after the song that it is about the dangers of listening to pop singers' advice and taking their lyrics too seriously.\n\nHe deals with some brief [[Heckler#Comedy|heckling]] before beginning a song about a breakup, which focuses on the man lashing out as a way of dealing with his emotions. He then begins analysing the show's meaning, the culture of performance promoted by [[social media]] and the concept of the [[Me generation]]. Burnham then delivers a song inspired by the way [[Kanye West]] ended his performances for [[The Yeezus Tour]], by ranting comedically about small annoyances such as the width of [[Pringles|Pringle]] cans and overfilled burritos until slowly transitioning into singing about his conflicted relationship with his audience and his stage anxiety. This ends the stage show, but a closing segment features Burnham in the guest house of his own home, talking to the viewer with a song where he addresses the rhetorical question \"Are you happy?\". The song, and the special, ends with Burnham leaving the guest house, and greeting his girlfriend and dog.\n\n==Analysis==\nThematically, as Burnham himself mentions in the special, ''Make Happy'' can be said to be \"about performing\".<ref name=\"Chortle\"/><ref name=\"Decider\"/> Throughout the show, Burnham maintains a \"prickly persona\" with the audience, \"alternating between making them laugh and baiting them, even insulting them\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The show is \"meticulously choreographed\"<ref name=\"Vine\"/> and makes extensive use of pre-recorded music, theatre lighting, sound effects and his audience;<ref name=Forbes/><ref name=Chortle/><ref name=\"Impact\"/> It has been described as a tonal continuation of ''what.'',<ref name=\"guardian\"/> which featured acts that have been compared to ''Make Happy''{{'}}s sandwich-making mime, breakup song, West parody,<ref name=\"Vine\"/><ref name=\"guardian\"/> and intersperses comedy, music, theatrics and poetry.<ref name=\"Impact\"/> The show has \"discrete bits\" which are \"seemingly disjointed\" and contain many \"small details\", but there are connections between them.<ref name=\"Impact\"/>\n\n''Make Happy'' jokes about common tropes in comedy and music.<ref name=\"splitsider interview\"/> The show's \"quiet moments of honesty\" serve to highlight a perceived lack of substance in the entertainment industry.<ref name=\"rolling\"/> Songs performed satirise [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[bro-country]] and \"inspirational\" [[pop music]].<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Other topics which the show comments on are the deification of celebrities and the omnipresent nature of social media. Burnham comments in an interview that the segment mocking Kanye West is \"done with love\", praising that West \"makes amazing things and he pours himself into his work\".<ref name=\"rolling\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/bo-burnham-talks-social-media-despair-why-trump-is-joke-proof-20160629|title=Bo Burnham Talks Social-Media Despair, Why Trump Is Joke-Proof|last=Daw|first=Stephen|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nFollowing the release of ''Make Happy'' on Netflix in June 2016, Burnham stated that it may be the last stand-up show he performs in the foreseeable future, as he planned to focus more on writing.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> During his time away, he wrote and directed the award-winning 2018 comedy-drama film ''[[Eighth Grade (film)|Eighth Grade]]''. In May 2021, he released the critically acclaimed special ''[[Bo Burnham: Inside|Inside]]'', which he shot and performed during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] without an audience or crew entirely in one room of his home (the same room in which ''Make Happy'' ends).\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Make Happy'' was very well received by critics. Hugar of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the show an A\u2212 rating, calling it \"one of the best stand up specials of the year\". Hugar noted that the show \"gets more avant-garde and considerably darker\" than Burnham's previous material and summarised, \"Burnham is a skilled comic and his combination of rapid-fire songwriting and meaty observations about modern life are captivating\".<ref name=\"avclub\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/bo-burnham-combines-anxiety-and-absurdity-brillian-237401|title=Bo Burnham combines anxiety and absurdity to brilliant effect on ''Make Happy''|last=Hugar|first=John|work=[[The A.V.
