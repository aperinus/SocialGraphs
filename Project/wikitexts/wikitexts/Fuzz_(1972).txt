Colla]] and starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Yul Brynner]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Tom Skerritt]] and [[Jack Weston]].\n\nThe screenplay was written by [[Evan Hunter]] based on the 1968 novel of the same name that is part of his ''[[87th Precinct]]'' written under the pen name [[Ed McBain]]. [[Dave Grusin]] composed the film's soundtrack score.\n\nAlthough the ''87th Precinct'' novels are set in a fictional metropolis based on [[New York City]], ''Fuzz'' is set in, and was shot on location in, [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Plot==\nDetectives Steve Carella, Meyer Meyer, Eileen McHenry and Bert Kling of the 87th Precinct investigating a murder-extortion racket run by a mysterious deaf man. While attempting to investigate and prevent the murders of several high-ranking city officials, they must also follow a string of robberies. Further complicating matters is a rash of arson attacks on homeless men.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Detective Carella\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Detective McHenry\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as The Deaf Man\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Detective Kling\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Detective Meyer\n* [[James McEachin]] as Detective Brown\n* [[Bert Remsen]] as Sergeant Murchison\n* [[Steve Ihnat]] as Detective Parker\n* [[Peter Bonerz]] as Buck\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as La Bresca\n* [[Dan Frazer]] as Lieutenant Amos Byrnes\n* [[Norman Burton]] as Police Commissioner Nelson\n* [[Vince Howard]] as Patrolman Marshall\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Detective\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Pete\n* [[Neile Adams]] as Teddy\n* [[Tamara Dobson]] as Rochelle\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as \"Baby\"\n* [[Robert Jaffe (producer)|Robert Jaffe]] as Alan Parry\n\n==Production==\nThe film's opening-credits sequence was filmed in and around [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]'s [[City Square]] station on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]]'s elevated [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] (demolished in 1975), as well as the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] as it emerges from its [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] tunnel to cross the [[Longfellow Bridge]] en route into [[Boston]]. Other Boston filming locations include the [[North End, Boston|North End]], the [[Boston Common]] and the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Public Garden]], where [[Burt Reynolds]] is disguised as a nun.\n\nReynolds recalled: \"It was kind of fuzzy. It was made by one of those hot shot TV directors. I liked working with [[Jack Weston]]; it began our relationship. I did like working again with Raquel. And I liked the writer whose book the film was based on, Ed McBain, ''The 87th Precinct''. I'd like to direct one of his books.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Workaholic Burt Reynolds sets up his next task: Light comedy|author=Siskel, Gene|date=Nov 28, 1976|work=Chicago Tribune|page=e2}}</ref>\n\nWelch was paid $100,000 for nine days of work. There was to be a scene in which Welch's character appears in her bra and panties in the men's room, but Welch refused to appear in it. Despite attempting alternate shoots, producer Ed Feldman said that \"it just didn't work. ... We promised United Artists we'd deliver a certain picture and we haven't got it.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Raquel in Flap Over Men's Room Scene|date=Dec 30, 1971|work=Los Angeles Times|page=e18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three stars out of four and called it \"an offbeat, funny, quietly cheerful movie in which Ed McBain's 87th Precinct is finally brought to life. Several movies have been based on McBain's 87th Precinct novels, but never one in which the squad room was explored so lovingly by the camera, and the detectives were made so human.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fuzz-1972 |title=Fuzz |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 11, 1972 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=June 3, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIn a negative review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] remarked that the film \"looks more like a dress rehearsal than a finished film, a very dry run for something that is apparently meant to be a comedy-melodrama about ineptitude, especially the day-to-day ineptitude of a group of detectives attached to a Boston police station.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (July 15, 1972). \"The Screen: Cops Take Rap in 'Fuzz'\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 29.</ref>\n\nArthur D. Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the screenplay as \"excellent\" and \"a rare combination of effective interlocking vignettes which logically and literately evolve towards a climax.\" Of the performances, Murphy wrote, \"Reynolds is very good, Weston and James McEachin are excellent, and Skerritt is outstanding as the principal quartet of detectives spotlighted in the hunt for Brynner. Miss Welch's developed cameo as a sexy policewoman is a decided plus.\"<ref>Murphy, Arthur D. (May 24, 1972). \"Film Reviews: Fuzz\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. 19.</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded the film three stars out of four and wrote that it has \"something for everyone: Raquel Welch and Burt Reynolds. Only a solve-three-plots-at-once ending spoils the entertainment.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (June 11, 1972). \"Fuzz\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' declared the film \"a solid piece of craftsmanship, well-paced and skilfully assembled,\" although he felt that it \"could have been just as diverting had it been played less broadly and for more in-depth characterization. As it is, 'Fuzz' succeeds as a mindless entertainment.\"<ref>Thomas, Kevin (May 23, 1972). \"'Fuzz' Film Features Raquel, Burt---Clothed\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 14.</ref>\n\nGary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film \"a sprightly, genial take-off on the cops-and-robbers formula\" as well as \"the most amusing and attractive commercial vehicle I've seen since '[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]],' and it recommends itself in a similar way \u2014 as an agreeable throwaway entertainment, ideally suited for summertime moviegoing.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (July 25, 1972). \"Fuzz, MASHed\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. B1.</ref>\n\nTony Collier of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' thought that \"the comedy here, ladled on with a satirical fervour that invites overstatement, works in isolation, with no real interplay between it and the violence, so that the two elements coexist without ever quite managing to coalesce. ''Fuzz'' is nevertheless an intelligent and enjoyable film, and often very funny.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Tony |date=October 1972 |title=Fuzz |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=39 |issue=465 |page=212 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIn Boston on October 2, 1973, 24-year-old white woman Evelyn Wagler was walking to her car with a two-gallon can of gasoline. Six black teenagers dragged her into an alley and forced her to pour gasoline on herself. She complied and was then set ablaze by the teenagers, who walked away laughing. The hate crime occurred during a racially tense period in Boston. After the incident, the press reported that ''Fuzz'' had aired on nationwide television the previous weekend and that the perpetrators may have reenacted an attack portrayed in the movie. The case was never solved.<ref name=\"Evelyn Wagler Murder\">[http://www.celebrateboston.com/crime/evelyn-wagler-murder.htm Evelyn Wagler Murder] at CelebrateBoston.com</ref>\n\nIn Miami on October 20, 1973, 38-year-old Charles Scales, a homeless person sleeping outdoors behind an abandoned building, was approached by a group of teenagers, doused with gasoline and set on fire. Two other homeless people were also attacked in the same incident but escaped. A survivor stated the teenagers \"were laughing and throwing gas and striking matches\" at them.<ref name=\"Modesto Bee\">\"Torch Victim Tells Killer's Name, Dies\", ''Modesto Bee'', October 22, 1973, page b-2, AP Story</ref> The film was mentioned in news reports about the murder, as the attack closely one of its scenes. This murder did not appear to have been racially motivated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe incidents led to a careful review by network television [[Broadcast Standards and Practices|Standards and Practices]] departments and a general feeling among the public that television violence was inspiring real-life acts of violence. Networks were forced curb the amount of violence that they broadcast throughout the decade, and ''Fuzz'' was temporarily withdrawn from television broadcast until it returned to [[cable television]] years later.{{Cit|date=August 2022}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1972]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0068617|Fuzz}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title|17554|Fuzz}}\n* {{AFI film|54514}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|fuzz}}\n\n{{Richard A.
