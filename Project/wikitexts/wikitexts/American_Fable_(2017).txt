She is shocked to discover, however, that the developer buying up local farms is now seemingly being kept prisoner in the family's old abandoned grain silo at the edge of the farm. Gitty begins spending time with the man, ultimately finding herself torn between loyalty to what she thinks is right, and loyalty to her own family. All is not as it may seem, though, as the family finds itself involved with individuals who are like something out of a fairy tale.\n\n==Cast== \n*[[Peyton Kennedy]] as Gitty\n*[[Richard Schiff]] as Jonathan\n*[[Kip Pardue]] as Abe \n*[[Marci Miller]] as Sarah\n*[[Gavin MacIntosh]] as Martin\n*[[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Vera\n*Charlie Babbo as Michael\n*Spencer Moss as Heidi\n*[[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Ethel\n*Theresa Tilly as Anna Winters\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 13, 2016.<ref name=\"variety1\"/> On August 16, 2016, [[IFC Films|IFC Midnight]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ifc-midnight-nabs-fairytale-thriller-919973 |title=IFC Midnight Nabs Fairytale Thriller 'American Fable' (Exclusive) |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2016-08-16 |accessdate=2016-10-16}}</ref> The film was released on February 17, 2017, by IFC Midnight.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kirk Mattu |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/american-fable-conjures-up-dark-fairytale-world-first-trailer-video-965223 |title='American Fable' Conjures Up Dark Fairy-Tale World in First Trailer (Exclusive Video) |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2017-01-18 |accessdate=2017-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''American Fable'' holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 16 reviews, and an average rating of 7.26/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=American Fable (2017) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_fable |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Fandango Media |accessdate=22 July 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports a score of 55/100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/american-fable|title=American Fable Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=22 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|4671002|American Fable}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|m/american_fable|American Fable}}\n\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:2016 thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-thriller-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
