The film was [[Film adaptation|adapted]] by [[Paddy Chayefsky]] from the 1951 musical ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' by [[Lerner and Loewe]]. It is set in a [[mining]] camp in [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]-era [[California]]. It was directed by [[Joshua Logan]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen a [[Covered wagon|wagon]] crashes into a ravine, [[Prospecting|prospector]] Ben Rumson ([[Lee Marvin]]) finds two adult male occupants, brothers, one of whom is dead and the other of whom has a broken arm and leg. While burying the dead man, [[gold]] dust is discovered at the grave site. Ben stakes a claim on the land and adopts the surviving brother ([[Clint Eastwood]]) as his \"Pardner\" while he recuperates.\n\nPardner is innocent and romantic, singing a love song about an imaginary girl (\"I Still See Elisa\"). He hopes to make enough in the [[gold rush]] to buy some land and is suspicious of the fast-living Ben. Ben claims that while he is willing to fight, steal, and cheat at cards, he will never betray a partner. Ben will share the spoils of prospecting on the condition that Pardner takes care of him in his moments of drunkenness and melancholy.\n\nAfter the discovery of gold, \"No Name City\" springs up as a [[tent city]], with the miners alternating between wild parties (\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\") and bouts of loneliness (\"They Call the Wind Maria\"). The men become frustrated with the lack of female companionship, and the arrival of Jacob Woodling ([[John Mitchum]]), a [[Mormon]] with [[Mormonism and polygamy|two wives]], is enough to catch the attention of the entire town. The miners persuade Woodling to sell one of his wives to the highest bidder. Elizabeth ([[Jean Seberg]]), Jacob's younger and more rebellious wife, agrees to be sold based on the reasoning that whatever she gets can't be as bad as what she currently has.\n\nStill drunk, Ben winds up with the highest bid for Elizabeth. Ben is readied for the wedding by the other miners (\"Whoop-Ti-Ay\"), and is married to Elizabeth under \"mining law\", with Ben being granted exclusive rights to \"all her mineral resources.\" Elizabeth, not content to be treated as property, threatens to shoot Ben on their wedding night if she is not treated with respect. While she believes Ben is not the type to truly settle down, she views their arrangement as acceptable if he will build a proper wooden cabin to provide her with some security for when he inevitably leaves. Ben, impressed by Elizabeth's determination, enlists the miners to help him keep this promise, and Elizabeth rejoices in having a proper home (\"A Million Miles Away Behind the Door\").\n\nNews comes of the pending arrival of \"six French [[Prostitution|tarts]]\" to a neighboring town via [[stagecoach]]. A plan is hatched to divert the stagecoach under false pretenses and bring the women to \"No Name City\" (\"There's a Coach Comin' In\"), thus finally providing the other miners with female companionship. Ben heads up the mission and leaves Elizabeth in the care of Pardner. The two fall in love (\"I Talk to the Trees\"), whereupon Elizabeth, saying she also still loves Ben, convinces them that \"if a Mormon man can have two wives, why can't a woman have two husbands?\" The [[Polyandry|polyandrous]] arrangement works until the town becomes large enough that civilized people from the East begin to settle there. A parson ([[Alan Dexter]]) begins to make a determined effort to persuade the people of No Name City to give up their evil ways (\"The Gospel of No Name City\"). Meanwhile, Ben and a group of miners discover that gold dust is dropping through the floor boards of many of the saloons. They tunnel under all the businesses to get the gold (\"The Best Things in Life Are Dirty\").\n\nA group of new settlers is rescued from the snow and the strait-laced family is invited to spend the winter with Elizabeth and Pardner, who is assumed to be her only husband. Ben is left to fend for himself (\"Wand'rin' Star\"). In revenge, he introduces one of the family, naive young Horton Fenty ([[Tom Ligon]]), to the pleasures of Rotten Luck Willie's ([[Harve Presnell]]) [[Western saloon|saloon]] and [[brothel]]. This leads to Elizabeth dismissing both Ben and Pardner from the log cabin, and Pardner takes to gambling in Willie's (\"Gold Fever\"). During a bull-and-bear fight, the rampaging bull falls into the tunnel complex dug by Ben and the others and knocks out all of the support beams, causing the streets and buildings to collapse. Eventually, the town is destroyed entirely. Ben departs for other gold fields, commenting that he never knew Pardner's real name, which Pardner then reveals: Sylvester Newel. Elizabeth and Pardner reconcile and plan to stay, while musing about Ben's next great adventure.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Ben Rumson\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Sylvester Newel/\"Pardner\"\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Rotten Luck Willie\n* [[Ray Walston]] as \"Mad Jack\" Duncan\n* [[Tom Ligon]] as Horton Fenty\n* [[Alan Dexter]] as The Parson\n* [[William O'Connell (actor)|William O'Connell]] as Horace Tabor\n* Ben Baker as Haywood Holbrook\n* [[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]] as Mr. Fenty\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Mrs. Fenty\n* [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] as Atwell\n* Geoffrey Norman as Foster\n* [[Hard Boiled Haggerty|H.B.

The film's initial budget was $10&nbsp;million, before it eventually doubled to $20&nbsp;million. A daily expense of $80,000 was incurred to transport cast and crew to the filming location, as the closest hotel was nearly 60 miles away. The elaborate camp used in the film cost $2.4&nbsp;million to build.<ref name=\"Hughes92\"/>\n\nThe film was released at a time when [[Musical film|movie musicals]] were going out of fashion, especially with younger audiences. Its overblown budget and nearly three-hour length became notorious in the press. Eastwood was frustrated by the long delays in the making of the film, later saying that the experience strengthened his resolve to become a director. According to [[Robert Osborne]], Marvin drank heavily during filming, which may have enhanced his screen appearance, but led to delays and many retakes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\n==Release==\n''Paint Your Wagon'' opened at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State II]] theatre in [[New York City]] on October 15, 1969.<ref name=AFI/> In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], ''Paint Your Wagon'' had a 79-week 70mm roadshow run at the [[Astoria Theatre]] in [[London]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nVincent Canby, in his October 16, 1969 review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the film was \"amiable...
