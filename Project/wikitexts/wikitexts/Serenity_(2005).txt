The film is a continuation of Whedon's short-lived 2002 [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and stars the same cast, taking place after the events of the [[Objects in Space|final episode]]. Set in 2517, ''Serenity'' is the story of the crew of ''[[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|Serenity]]'', a \"''Firefly''-class\" spaceship. The captain and first mate are veterans of the Unification War, having fought on the losing Independent side against the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]]. Their lives of smuggling and cargo-running are interrupted by a [[psychic]] passenger who harbors a dangerous secret.\n\nThe film stars <!--PER BILLING BLOCK--> [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Alan Tudyk]], [[Adam Baldwin]], [[Summer Glau]] and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]. ''Serenity'' was released in North America on September 30, 2005, by [[Universal Pictures]] to generally positive reviews and several accolades, including the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], the [[Prometheus Award|Prometheus Special Award]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Script]], but underperformed at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 26th century, humanity has colonized a new solar system. The central planets formed the [[Alliance (Firefly)|Alliance]] and won a war against the outer planet [[Browncoat|Independents]] who resisted joining the Alliance. [[River Tam]] is conditioned by Alliance scientists into becoming a psychic and an assassin but is soon rescued by her brother [[List of Firefly characters#Simon Tam|Dr. Simon Tam]]. During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several top government officials and learned their secrets. Consequently, an Alliance agent known only as [[List of Firefly characters#The Operative|the Operative]] is tasked with recapturing her.\n\nThe siblings have found refuge aboard the transport spaceship ''[[Serenity (Firefly vessel)|Serenity]]'' with Captain [[Malcolm Reynolds|Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds]], first mate [[Zoe Washburne]], pilot [[Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne]], mercenary [[Jayne Cobb (Firefly character)|Jayne Cobb]], and mechanic [[Kaylee Frye]]. Despite Simon's objections, Mal brings River on a bank robbery. River warns them that savage and cannibalistic [[Reavers (Firefly)|Reavers]] are coming. They escape, but Simon decides he and River will leave ''Serenity'' at the next port. Once there, however, a [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal message]] in a television commercial causes River to attack numerous bar patrons, and Mal takes the siblings back aboard the ship. The crew contacts reclusive [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] Mr. Universe, who discovers the message designed to trigger River's mental conditioning. He notes River whispered \"Miranda\" before attacking and warns that someone else has viewed the footage.\n\nMal receives an invitation from [[List of Firefly characters#Inara Serra|Inara Serra]]. Realising it is a trap, Mal goes to confront the Operative who promises to let him go free if he hands over River. Mal barely escapes. Miranda is discovered to be a planet located beyond a region of space swarming with Reavers. The crew flies to the planet Haven but find it devastated and their friend [[Shepherd Book]] mortally wounded. The Operative promises to kill anyone who assists them until he gets River.\n\nMal has the crew disguise ''Serenity'' as a Reaver ship and they travel to Miranda undetected. They find its 30 million colonists dead, and a recording that explains an experimental chemical to suppress aggression had been added into Miranda's atmosphere. The population became so docile they stopped performing all [[activities of daily living]] and placidly died. A small proportion of them had [[paradoxical reaction|the opposite reaction]] and became insanely aggressive and violent. The Alliance had created the Reavers and this was the secret in River's subconscious.\n\nMr. Universe agrees to broadcast the recording. However, the Operative kills him and prepares an ambush. Knowing this, the crew provoke the Reaver fleet into chasing them toward the Alliance armada. The Reavers and Alliance battle while Wash pilots ''Serenity'' through the crossfire. He crash lands near the broadcast tower before being fatally impaled by a Reaver spear.\n\nThe crew make a [[last stand]] against the Reavers to buy Mal time to broadcast the recording. The crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. Simon is shot, and River dives through the doors to throw back Simon's medical kit and close the doors before the Reavers drag her away. At the transmitter, Mal fights the Operative, finally subduing him and forcing him to watch as the recording is broadcast. Mal returns to the crew. The blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. The Operative orders the Alliance troops to stand down.\n\nThe Operative provides medical aid and resources to repair ''Serenity.'' He tells Mal the broadcast has weakened the Alliance government, but while he will try to convince the Parliament that River and Simon are no longer threats, he warns that they may continue their pursuit in retribution for getting the word out. ''Serenity'' takes off, with River as Mal's new pilot.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Firefly characters{{!}}List of ''Firefly'' characters}}\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Captain [[Malcolm Reynolds|Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds]]\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Zo\u00eb Alleyne Washburne\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne\n* [[Morena Baccarin]] as Inara Serra\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as Jayne Cobb\n* [[Jewel Staite]] as Kaywinnet Lee \"Kaylee\" Frye\n* [[Sean Maher]] as Simon Tam\n* [[Summer Glau]] as [[River Tam]]\n* [[Ron Glass]] as [[Shepherd Book]]\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Mr. Universe\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as The Operative\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Dr. Mathias\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Dr. Caron\n* Yan Feldman as Mingo\n* Rafael Feldman as Fanty\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film is based on ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', a television series canceled by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] in December 2002, after 11 of its 14 produced episodes had aired.<ref name=\"VisualCompanion17\" /> Attempts to have other networks acquire the series failed,<ref name=\"NetworksNixFirefly\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-01/15/13.00.tv |title=Networks Nix ''Firefly'' |date=January 15, 2003 |publisher=[[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030116082340/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2003-01%2F15%2F13.00.tv |archive-date=January 16, 2003 |access-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref> and creator [[Joss Whedon]] started to sell it as a film.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bianculli |first=David |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ent_radio/story/83903p-76694c.html |title=Fox anchored in reality, plus seven new scripts |date=May 16, 2003 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803051106/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ent_radio/story/83903p-76694c.html |archive-date=August 3, 2003 |author-link=David Bianculli}}</ref> He had been working on a film script since the show's cancellation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/436/436688p1.html?fromint=1 |title=Whedon Flies into ''Firefly'' Movie |date=September 4, 2003 |website=[[IGN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204201847/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/436/436688p1.html?fromint=1 |archive-date=December 4, 2003 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref> Shortly after the cancellation, he contacted [[Barry Mendel]], who was working with [[Universal Studios]], and \"flat-out asked him\" for a way to continue the series as a film, including as a low-budget television film.

Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the [[Western (genre)|Western]], he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, he did not want to step too far into Western clich\u00e9s to \"cause justified derision\" and hoped the score would also draw from [[Chinese music|Chinese]] and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements \"mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a clich\u00e9 as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not so comfortable that we begin to be told where the story is.\" Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be \"either too airy or too sophisticated\".<ref name=\"VisualCompanionOnMusic\">{{Cite book |title=Serenity: The Official Visual Companion |last=Whedon |first=Joss |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1845760823 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/serenityofficial0000whed/page/30 30\u201331] |url=https://archive.org/details/serenityofficial0000whed/page/30}}</ref>\n\nUniversal Studios wanted a composer with experience scoring films, ruling out ''Firefly''{{'s}} composer [[Greg Edmonson]].

The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, regardless of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not.<ref>Whedon, ''Serenity: Director's Commentary'', track 11 \"Miranda\"</ref> What the crew of ''Serenity'' represent\u2014specifically Mal and his lifestyle\u2014is the idea that people should have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are bad.<ref name=\"DC17\">Whedon, ''Serenity: Director's Commentary'', track 17 \"Fighting for Belief\"</ref>\n\nThe Operative embodies the Alliance and is, as Whedon describes, the \"perfect product of what's wrong with the Alliance\". He is someone whose motives are to achieve a good end, a \"world without sin\". The Operative believes so strongly in this idea that he willingly compromises his humanity in furtherance of it\u2014as he himself admits, he would have no place in this world. In contrast, Mal is, at the movie's beginning, a man who has lost all faith.<ref>Whedon, ''Serenity: Director's Commentary'', track 2 \"A Better World\"; Whedon, Serenity: The Official Visual Companion, p. 21.</ref> By the movie's ending, Mal has finally come to believe so strongly in something\u2014individual liberty\u2014that he becomes willing to lay down his life to preserve it.<ref name=\"DC17\" /><ref name=\"DC10\">Whedon, ''Serenity: Director's Commentary'', track 10 \"Posing a Threat\".</ref>\n\nWhedon has said that the most important line spoken in the film is when Mal forces the Operative to watch the Miranda footage at the climax of the film, promising him: \"I'm going to show you a world without sin\". Whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity.<ref name=\"DC17\" />  According to Whedon, the planet \"Miranda\" was named for [[William Shakespeare]]'s Miranda in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', who in Act V, scene I says: \"O brave new world, / That has such people in't!\"<ref name=\"DC10\" /> A spaceship found on the planet Miranda carries the codename \"C57D\", a reference to the flying saucer in the 1956 film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. The plot to ''Forbidden Planet'' is based on ''The Tempest'' and, like ''Serenity'', features a character struggling with his subconscious.<ref name=\"Blichert2017\">{{cite book|author=Frederick Blichert|title=Serenity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kI5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT114|date=November 28, 2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-54411-5|pages=114\u2013}}</ref> The Alliance had hoped that Miranda would be a new kind of world, filled with peaceful, happy people, and represents the \"inane optimism of the Alliance\".<ref>Whedon, ''Serenity: Director's Commentary'', Track 14, \"Learning the Secret\"</ref>\n\nThe Fruity Oaty Bar commercial shown in the Maidenhead spaceport bar, which carried the subliminal message that triggered River Tam, is partially inspired by Mr. Sparkle, the mascot of a fictional brand of dish-washing detergent, who was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[In Marge We Trust]]\".<ref>Whedon, ''Serenity: Making of Fruity Oaty Bar on Serenity DVD''</ref> Whedon mentions in a DVD feature that when the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial was being designed, he constantly asked the animators to redesign it and make it even ''more'' bizarre than the previous design, until it arrived at the version presented on screen.\n\n==Cancelled sequel==\nFans had hoped that if ''Serenity'' had been successful, it might lead to either a sequel or a film trilogy.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Daniel |last=Terdiman |author-link=Daniel Terdiman |title=Fans of sci-fi 'Serenity' follow their bliss |publisher=[[News.com]] |date=August 3, 2007 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-6085564.html |access-date=June 20, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621222119/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1040_22-6085564.html |archive-date=June 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Murray |title=Nathan Fillion Talks About \"Serenity\": On Working with Joss Whedon and \"Firefly's\" Cancellation |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=December 6, 2004 |url=http://movies.about.com/od/serenity/a/serentynf120604.htm |access-date=January 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first major sequel rumor began on December 1, 2005, when [[IGN|IGN Filmforce]] reported that Universal had expressed an interest in making a ''Serenity'' television movie for broadcast on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]].
