It stars [[Craig Wasson]], [[Gregg Henry]], [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Deborah Shelton]]. The film is a direct homage to the 1950s films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], specifically ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'', taking plot lines and themes (such as [[voyeurism]] and obsession) from the first two.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams |first=Linda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pL0AUb5BHUC&pg=PA86|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|page=86|year=2005|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253218365 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Ann |last=Cvetkovich |chapter-url=http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |chapter=Postmodern Vertigo: The Sexual Politics of Allusion in De Palma's Body Double |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211060858/http://english.illinoisstate.edu/strickland/rsvtxt/cvetko.htm |archive-date=February 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |editor-last1=Raubicheck |editor-first1=Walter |editor-first2=Walter |editor-last2=Srebnick |title=Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo |location=Detroit |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of its release, the film received lukewarm success at the box office and mixed reviews, though Melanie Griffith's performance earned praise and brought her a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination. Subsequently, it has been better received and is now considered to be a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nStruggling actor Jake Scully has recently lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror film after his [[claustrophobia]] thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, Scully splits up with her and is left homeless, as the residence belongs to her. At a [[method acting]] class, where he meets Sam Bouchard, Scully reveals his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's rich friend has gone on a trip to Europe and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the [[Hollywood Hills]].\n\nWhile touring the house with Scully, Sam is especially enthusiastic about showing him one feature: a telescope, and through it a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle, who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Scully voyeuristically watches Gloria until he sees her being abused by a man she appears to know. The next day, he follows her when she goes shopping. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person who she promises to meet. Scully also notices a disfigured \"[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]\", a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows Gloria to a seaside motel where she is apparently stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach, the Indian suddenly appears and snatches her purse. Scully chases him into a nearby tunnel, but his claustrophobia overcomes him. Gloria walks him out of it, and they impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night, Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns and breaks into Gloria's home. Scully races to save Gloria, but her vicious white [[German Shepherd]] attacks him, and the Indian murders Gloria with a huge handheld drill.\n\n[[File:John Lautner's Chemosphere (8189866290).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chemosphere]], the ultramodern house used in ''Body Double'']]\nScully alerts the police, who rule the murder a botched robbery. However, Detective Jim McLean becomes suspicious after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in Scully's pocket. Although McLean does not arrest him, he tells Scully that his voyeuristic behavior and failure to alert police sooner helped cause Gloria's death. Later that night, suffering from insomnia and watching a pornographic television channel, Scully sees porn actress Holly Body dancing sensually, exactly as Gloria did. In order to meet Holly, he pretends to be a porn producer hiring for a new film.\n\nScully learns from Holly that Sam hired her to impersonate Gloria each night, dancing in the window, knowing Scully would be watching and later witness the real Gloria's murder. Offended when he suggests she was involved in a killing, Holly storms out of the house. The Indian picks her up, knocks her unconscious and drives away with her. Scully follows them to a reservoir where the Indian is digging a grave. Scully attacks him, and in the scuffle peels his face off to reveal it as a mask worn by Sam. Scully has been set up as a scapegoat by Sam, really Gloria's abusive husband Alex, to provide him with an [[alibi]] during the murder. Scully is overpowered and thrown into the grave. Though his claustrophobia initially incapacitates him again, he overcomes his fear and climbs out, and Sam is knocked into the aqueduct by the dog and drowned.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Scully is shown having been recast in his previous vampire role as Holly watches from the sidelines.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as Jake Scully\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Sam Bouchard / Alex Revelle\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Holly Body\n* [[Deborah Shelton]] as Gloria Revelle\n** [[Helen Shaver]] ''(uncredited)'' as Gloria's voice\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Detective Jim McLean\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Rubin\n* [[David Haskell]] as Will\n* [[Al Israel]] as Corso\n* Rebecca Stanley as Kimberly\n* [[Douglas Warhit]] as Video Salesman\n* B.J.

After fighting with censorship boards over the rating of ''Scarface'' \u2014 they rated it X and he had to battle to make it R \u2014 De Palma resolved to make ''Body Double'' as pushback. At the time, he said \"If this one doesn't get an X, nothing I ever do is going to. This is going to be the most erotic and surprising and thrilling movie I know how to make...

De Palma cut what he called \"a few minor things from the porno movie scene\" and got an R. De Palma said the studio did not support the film due to its excessive violence. \"Do you think the guys who run Coca-Cola (Columbia Pictures' parent company) want publicity about violence?
