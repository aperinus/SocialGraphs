Reilly]], [[Henry Thomas]], [[Stephen Graham]], [[Eddie Marsan]] and [[Brendan Gleeson]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is set in 1862, when a long-running [[Catholic\u2013Protestant relations|Catholic\u2013Protestant]] feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting against the threat of conscription.\n\nScorsese spent twenty years developing the project until [[Harvey Weinstein]] and his production company [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] acquired it in 1999.\n\nMade in [[Cinecitt\u00e0]], [[Rome]] and [[Long Island City]], [[New York City]], ''Gangs of New York'' was completed by 2001 but its release was delayed due to the [[September 11 attacks]]. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 20, 2002, and grossed over $193 million worldwide. It was met with generally positive reviews and Daniel Day-Lewis's performance was highly acclaimed. It received ten nominations at the [[75th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Scorsese and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Day-Lewis.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn the 1846 [[slum]] of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]], two [[gang]]s, the [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] [[Nativism (politics)#1830\u20131860|Confederation of American Natives]], led by [[William Poole|William \"Bill the Butcher\" Cutting]], and the [[Irish Americans|Irish]] [[Irish Catholics|Catholic]] immigrant [[Dead Rabbits]], led by \"Priest\" Vallon, engage in their final battle to determine which faction will hold sway over the territory. At the end of the battle, Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon's young son hides the knife that killed his father and is taken to an [[orphanage]] on [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]].\n\nIn 1862, Vallon's son, \u2018Amsterdam\u2019 returns to the Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who remains in control of the territory. Amsterdam is introduced to Bill but keeps his past a secret as he seeks recruitment into the gang. He learns many of his father's former allies are now in Bill's employ. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits and Amsterdam secretly plans to kill him publicly during this celebration. Amsterdam soon becomes attracted to [[pickpocketing|pickpocket]] and [[confidence trick|grifter]] Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is also infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and becomes his [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], involving him in the dealings of corrupt [[Tammany Hall]] politician [[William M. Tweed]]. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion.\n\nOn the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny's affections for Amsterdam, reveals Amsterdam's true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a [[knife throwing]] act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill then beats him and [[Human branding|burns]] his cheek with a hot blade. Going into hiding, Jenny implores him to escape with her to [[San Francisco]]. Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square. Bill sends corrupt Irish [[New York City Police Department|policeman]] Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam kills him and hangs his body in the square as well. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. When Amsterdam's gang beats McGloin, one of Bill's lieutenants, Bill and the Natives march on the church and are met by Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits. No violence ensues, but Bill promises to return soon. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Amsterdam presents Tweed with a plan to defeat Bill's influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] and Amsterdam will secure the Irish vote for Tammany. Monk wins in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]], and a humiliated Bill murders him. McGinn's death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square, which Bill accepts.\n\nThe [[New York City draft riots|Civil War draft riots]] break out just as the gangs are preparing to fight, and [[Union Army]] soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs fight, cannon fire from ships is directed into Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Many of the gang members are killed by the naval gunfire, soldiers or rioters. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another until Bill gets wounded by a piece of shrapnel. Amsterdam then uses his father's knife to kill Bill.\n\nAmsterdam buries Bill in a cemetery in [[Brooklyn]], next to his father. As Amsterdam and Jenny leave, the skyline changes as modern New York City is built over the next century, from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], and the cemetery becomes overgrown and forgotten.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Amsterdam Vallon\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as William \"Bill the Butcher\" Cutting (based on [[William Poole]])\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Jenny Everdeane\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[William M.

This was the America not [of] the West with its wide open spaces, but of claustrophobia, where everyone was crushed together. On one hand, you had the first great wave of immigration, the Irish, who were Catholic, spoke Gaelic, and owed allegiance to the Vatican. On the other hand, there were the Nativists, who felt that they were the ones who had fought and bled, and died for the nation. They looked at the Irish coming off the boats and said, \"What are you doing here?\" It was chaos, tribal chaos. Gradually, there was a street by street, block by block, working out of democracy as people learned somehow to live together.

At the time, he had noticed there were parts of his neighborhood that were much older than the rest, including tombstones from the 1810s in [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York|Old St. Patrick's Cathedral]], [[cobblestone]] streets and small basements located under more recent large buildings; this sparked Scorsese's curiosity about the history of the area: \"I gradually realized that the Italian-Americans weren't the first ones there, that other people had been there before us. As I began to understand this, it fascinated me. I kept wondering, how did New York look? What were the people like? How did they walk, eat, work, dress?\"<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fergusbordewich.com/PAGESjournalism/FBgangs.shtml |title=Manhattan Mayhem |first=Fergus M. |last=Bordewich |date=December 2002 |magazine=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |access-date=July 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn 1970, Scorsese came across [[Herbert Asbury]]'s ''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld'' (1927) about the city's nineteenth-century criminal underworld and found it to be a revelation. In the portraits of the city's criminals, Scorsese saw the potential for an American epic about the battle for the modern American democracy.<ref name=Smithsonian/> At the time, Scorsese was a young director without money or fame; by the end of the decade, with the success of crime films such as ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), about his old neighborhood, and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), he was a rising star. In 1979, he acquired screen rights to Asbury's book; however, it took twenty years to get the production moving forward. Difficulties arose with reproducing the monumental cityscape of nineteenth-century New York with the style and detail Scorsese wanted; almost nothing in New York City looked as it did in that time, and filming elsewhere was not an option. As of 1991, the project was originally to be financed by [[Universal Pictures]] on a budget of $30 million. However, the studio assigned the rights to the project to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] in 1997, whose then-chairman [[Joe Roth]] turned down the film due to its excessive violence, which was \"not appropriate for a Disney-themed movie\". Scorsese took the film to [[Warner Bros.]], being contractually obligated to make a film for the studio; the film was however declined by Warner Bros. as well, and afterward declined similarly by [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].<ref name=afi>{{cite web|title=Gangs of New York (2002)|website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|access-date=11 May 2022|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/54000-GANGS-OFNEWYORK?sid=e5357eb6-e9d0-4937-94a0-882767b1b7e9&sr=13.134253&cp=1&pos=1}}</ref> Eventually, in 1999, Scorsese was able to find a partnership with [[Harvey Weinstein]], noted producer and co-chairman of [[Miramax Films]].<ref name=Smithsonian/> As the film had a large budget of nearly $100 million, Weinstein then sold international distribution rights to the project to [[Graham King]]'s [[GK Films|Initial Entertainment Group]] for about $65 million to secure the required funds. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] joined Miramax in funding the film, in exchange for a portion of the proceeds from domestic distribution.<ref name=afi /> [[Jay Cocks]] was retained by Scorsese for the film script adaptation which was reported in ''The New Yorker'' in March 2000 as having gone through nine revised drafts of development with Scorsese.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/03/27/the-man-who-forgets-nothing-2 |title=The Man Who Forgets Nothing |last=Singer |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Singer (journalist) |date=March 19, 2000 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>\n\n===Set design===\nIn order to create the sets that Scorsese envisioned, the production was filmed at the large [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] Studio in [[Rome]], Italy. [[Production design]]er [[Dante Ferretti]] recreated over a mile of mid-nineteenth century New York buildings, consisting of a five-block area of [[Lower Manhattan]], including the Five Points slum, a section of the [[East River]] waterfront including two full-sized sailing ships, a thirty-building stretch of lower [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], a patrician mansion, and replicas of Tammany Hall, a church, a saloon, a Chinese theater, and a gambling casino.<ref name=Smithsonian/> For the Five Points, Ferretti recreated [[George Catlin]]'s painting of the area.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n===Rehearsals and character development===\n\nParticular attention was also paid to the speech of characters, as loyalties were often revealed by their accents. The film's voice coach, Tim Monich, resisted using a generic [[Hiberno-English|Irish brogue]] and instead focused on distinctive dialects of Ireland and Great Britain. As DiCaprio's character was born in Ireland but raised in the United States, his accent was designed to be a blend of accents typical of the half-Americanized. To develop the unique, lost accents of the Yankee \"Nativists\" such as Daniel Day-Lewis's character, Monich studied old poems, ballads, newspaper articles (which sometimes imitated spoken dialect as a form of humor) and the ''Rogue's Lexicon'', a book of underworld idioms compiled by New York's police commissioner, so that his men would be able to tell what criminals were talking about. An important piece was an 1892 [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]] recording of [[Walt Whitman]] reciting four lines of a poem in which he pronounced the word \"Earth\" as \"Uth\", and the \"a\" of \"an\" nasal and flat, like \"ayan\". Monich concluded that native nineteenth-century New Yorkers probably sounded something like the proverbial [[Brooklyn]] [[Taxicab|cabbie]] of the mid-20th century.<ref name=Smithsonian/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:D\u00e9cor pour Paris au XIX\u00e8 si\u00e8cle (Cinnecitt\u00e0) (5855733721).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Set of the movie at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios in [[Rome]], Italy.]]\n[[Principal photography]] began in New York and Rome on December 18, 2000, and ended on March 30, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/439335/Gangs-of-New-York/original-print-info.html |title=Gangs of New York (2002) - Original Print Information |access-date=August 21, 2021 |website=Turner Classic Movies |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011225006/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/439335/Gangs-of-New-York/original-print-info.html |archive-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> Due to the strong personalities and clashing visions of director and producer, the three year production became a story in and of itself.<ref name=Smithsonian/><ref name=NYT040702>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/business/2-hollywood-titans-brawl-over-a-gang-epic.html |title=2 Hollywood Titans Brawl Over a Gang Epic |first=Laura M. |last=Holson |date=April 7, 2002 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name=NYT101102>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/business/media/11STUD.html |title=Miramax Blinks, and a Double DiCaprio Vanishes |first=Laura M. |last=Holson |date=October 11, 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name=NYT021303>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/12/movies/it-s-harvey-weinstein-s-turn-to-gloat.html |title=It's Harvey Weinstein's Turn to Gloat |first=Rick |last=Lyman |date=February 12, 2003 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 15, 2010}}</ref> Scorsese strongly defended his artistic vision on issues of taste and length while Weinstein fought for a streamlined, more commercial version.

In December 2001, film critic Jeffrey Wells reviewed a purported [[workprint]] of the film as it existed in the fall of 2001. Wells reported the work print lacked narration, was about 20 minutes longer, and although it was \"different than the [theatrical] version&nbsp;... scene after scene after scene play[s] exactly the same in both.\" Despite the similarities, Wells found the work print to be richer and more satisfying than the theatrical version. While Scorsese has stated the theatrical version is his [[final cut privilege|final cut]], he reportedly \"passed along [the] three-hour-plus [work print] version of ''Gangs'' on tape [to friends] and confided, 'Putting aside my contractual obligation to deliver a shorter, two-hour-and-forty-minute version to [[Miramax]], this is the version I'm happiest with,' or words to that effect.\"<ref name=\"quickstopentertainment\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[Roger Ebert]], Scorsese clarified the real issues in the cutting of the film.

Records indicate the riots resulted in more than one hundred deaths, including the lynching of 11 free African-Americans.

After negotiations between several parties, including the interests of DiCaprio, Weinstein and DreamWorks' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the decision was made on economic grounds: DiCaprio did not want to face a conflict of promoting two movies opening against each other; Katzenberg was able to convince Weinstein that the violence and adult material in ''Gangs of New York'' would not necessarily attract families on Christmas. Of main concern to all involved was attempting to maximize the film's opening day, an important part of film industry economics.<ref name=NYT101102/>\n\nGangs of New York was released on VHS and a 2-disc DVD July 1, 2003, the film was split on both discs.
