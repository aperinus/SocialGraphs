Leonetti]], in his directorial debut, from a screenplay by Brent V. Friedman and [[Bryce Zabel]]. Based on the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' video game franchise, it is the second installment in the [[Mortal Kombat (film series)|''Mortal Kombat'' film series]] and a sequel to the [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|original 1995 film]], of which Leonetti served as cinematographer. Largely an adaptation of the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1995), ''Annihilation'' follows [[Liu Kang]] and his allies as they attempt to stop the malevolent [[Shao Kahn]] from conquering Earthrealm. It stars [[Robin Shou]] as Liu, [[Talisa Soto]] as [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]], [[James Remar]] as [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], [[Sandra Hess]] as [[Sonya Blade]], Lynn Red Williams as [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], and [[Brian Thompson]] as Kahn. Only Shou and Soto reprise their roles, with the rest of the characters recast from the previous film.\n\nReleased to theaters on November 21, 1997, ''Annihilation'' was very panned for its story, characters, and special effects. It was also a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing $51 million against a $30 million budget. Due to the film's poor critical and commercial response, a direct sequel was cancelled. A third ''Mortal Kombat'' film languished in [[development hell]] for nearly two decades until the series was [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] by a [[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)|2021 installment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe Outworld emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal to Earthrealm and has resurrected Queen Sindel, Princess Kitana's long-deceased mother, to facilitate his invasion. Thunder god Rayden and Earthrealm warriors Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage try to defend themselves, but Kahn kills Cage. The Earthrealm warriors retreat to seek allies.\n\nSonya Blade enlists the help of her Special Forces partner, Major Jackson \"Jax\" Briggs, she finds him, but the two are attacked by the Cyber Ninja Cyrax, and a group of Kahn's Extermination Squad, but Sonya and Jax emerge victorious, later on they split up, Sonya then finds a mud clearing with a gargoyle of a monster, then she is attacked by the female assassin Mileena and they fight, Sonya defeats Mileena, then the Gargoyle Monster comes to life to eat Sonya but Jax saves her in time and defeats the monster. Meanwhile, Kitana and Liu search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf, who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn, but are then attacked by the Cyber Ninja Smoke and are saved by Sub-Zero. Later, Scorpion appears and fights Sub-Zero and then kidnaps Kitana.\n\nRayden meets with the Elder Gods and asks them why Kahn was allowed to break the tournament rules and force his way into Earthrealm, and how he can be stopped. One says that reuniting Kitana with her mother, Sindel, is the key to breaking Kahn's hold on Earthrealm, but another Elder God insists that the defeat of Kahn himself is the solution. Rayden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival.\n\nLiu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster's strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass three tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem, courage, and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of Jade, a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade's offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods' temple, where he and his friends meet with Rayden. The third test is never revealed.\n\nThe Earthrealm warriors learn that Rayden has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they infiltrate Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. Liu rescues Kitana while fighting Baraka and Sheeva, while the others incapacitate Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn's control and escapes during an ambush. Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes' plans. Kahn feeds Jade to the Gargoyle Monster for her failure. Rayden reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother and that the former Elder God Shinnok is their father. He realizes that Shinnok is supporting Kahn. Rayden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to Kahn, Sindel, and his remaining generals Motaro and Ermac. Shinnok demands that Rayden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Rayden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn.\n\nJax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn's generals. Liu struggles with Kahn. Liu's Animality proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal, as a consequence of his breaking the sacred rules. Shinnok attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn's behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok's treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm reverts to its former state. With Kahn's hold over Sindel broken, she reunites with Kitana. Rayden is revived by the Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father's former position. Before departing to the immortal realm, he enjoins the Earthrealm warriors to be there for one another. The Earthrealm warriors return home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n<!-- The film's credits spell \"Raiden\" as \"Rayden.\" Do not change to Raiden.-->\n* [[Robin Shou]] as [[Liu Kang]]\n* [[Talisa Soto]] as [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]]\n* [[James Remar]] as [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]]\n* [[Sandra Hess]] as [[Sonya Blade]]\n* Lynn Red Williams as [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]]\n* [[Brian Thompson]] as [[Shao Kahn]]\n* [[Reiner Sch\u00f6ne]] as [[Shinnok]]\n* [[Musetta Vander]] as [[Sindel]]\n* [[Irina Pantaeva]] as [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] \n* [[Deron McBee]] as [[Motaro]]\n* [[Marjean Holden]] as [[Sheeva]]\n* [[Litefoot]] as [[Nightwolf]]\n* [[Chris Conrad (actor)|Chris Conrad]] as [[Johnny Cage]]\n* John Medlen as [[Ermac]]\n* [[J.
