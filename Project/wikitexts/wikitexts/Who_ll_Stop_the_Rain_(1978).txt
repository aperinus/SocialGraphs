The movie was entered in the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1966/year/1978.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Who'll Stop the Rain |access-date=2009-05-21|website=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in Saigon at the height of the Vietnam War.\n\nJohn Converse, a disillusioned war correspondent, approaches Ray Hicks, a [[merchant marine]] sailor and acquaintance of Converse from the U.S., for help in smuggling a large quantity of heroin from Vietnam to San Francisco, where he will exchange the drugs for payment with Converse's wife Marge, who has become addicted to [[Hydromorphone|Dilaudid]].\n\nWhen Hicks gets back to the U.S. and discovers he is being followed by thugs connected either to Converse or his suppliers, he goes on the run with Marge and the heroin, and eventually they are pursued by corrupt DEA Agent Antheil, who initially set the deal in motion. As Marge is separated from her supply of Dilaudid, she experiences withdrawal, and Hicks decides to help wean her off her addiction by using the heroin. Hicks also attempts to find another buyer for the heroin before his pursuers can catch up to him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Ray Hicks\n* [[Tuesday Weld]] as Marge Converse\n* [[Michael Moriarty]] as John Converse\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Antheil\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Danskin\n* [[Ray Sharkey]] as Smitty\n* [[Gail Strickland]] as Charmian\n* [[Charles Haid]] as Eddie Peace\n* [[David Opatoshu]] as Bender\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez]] as Angel (as Joaquin Martinez)\n* James Cranna as Gerald\n* [[Timothy Blake]] as Jody\n* Shelby Balik as Janey\n* [[Jean Howell]] as Edna\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ruiz]] as Galindez (as Jose Carlos Ruiz)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background and production ==\nThe film is based on Robert Stone's novel ''[[Dog Soldiers (novel)|Dog Soldiers]]'' (1974), which won the [[National Book Award]] (US) for fiction in 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nationalbook.org/nbawinners1970.html|website=National Book Award|title=Winners 1970}}</ref> For its original US theatrical release it was re-titled ''Who'll Stop the Rain'', after the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] song, which features prominently (along with several other popular CCR tracks) on the film's soundtrack. The film was released as ''Dog Soldiers'' in several places. Some copies of the [[DVD]] of ''Who'll Stop the Rain'' contain prints titled ''Dog Soldiers''.\n\nStone based the character of Ray Hicks on [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writer [[Neal Cassady]], with whom Stone became acquainted through novelist [[Ken Kesey]], a graduate school classmate of Stone's at [[Stanford University]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nHicks' death scene on the railroad tracks at the film's conclusion is directly based on Cassady's death along a railroad track outside of [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Mexico]], in 1968.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[hippie]] [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] setting, where lights and stereo speakers placed throughout the woods are utilized in Hicks' escape plan, is partially based on Kesey's home in [[La Honda, California]], where Kesey and his friends &mdash; known as the [[Merry Pranksters]] &mdash; famously wired the surrounding woods with lights and sound equipment to enhance their experiments with [[LSD]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/books/higher-and-higher.html?pagewanted=1|title=America in the Great Stoned Age|date=June 6, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 18, 2010 | first=Hal | last=Espen}} Although technically not a commune, Kesey's home was a frequent site for large parties attended by a mixture of literary luminaries such as poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] and journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]], music figures (including [[Jerry Garcia]], whose group [[The Grateful Dead]] later became the house band for Kesey's famous [[Acid Tests]]), and outlaws, especially members of the infamous [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle club.  These parties are described intimately in works by Ginsberg and Thompson, and in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (1968). Ken Kesey, his Merry Pranksters, and Neal Cassady are also discussed in detail in [[Martin Torgoff]]'s book ''Can't Find My Way Home''.</ref>\n\nThe Saigon scenes were filmed on a set in Mexico. There was a casting advertisement in Mexico City for people of any Asian background to represent the Vietnamese.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Awards==\n* Nominee, Palme d'Or [[Cannes Film Festival]] (Karel Reisz)\n* Nominee, Best Actor [[National Society of Film Critics]] (Nick Nolte)\n* Nominee, Best Adapted Drama [[Writers Guild of America]] ([[Judith Rascoe]], [[Robert Stone (novelist)|Robert Stone]])\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n* [[Del Reeves]] - \"Philadelphia Fillies\"\n* [[Jackie DeShannon]] - \"[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]\"\n* [[Don McLean]] - \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\"\n* [[Slim Whitman]] - \"I'll Step Down\"\n* [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] - \"[[Hey Tonight]]\"\n* Creedence Clearwater Revival - \"[[Who'll Stop the Rain (song)|Who'll Stop the Rain]]\"\n* Creedence Clearwater Revival - \"[[Proud Mary]]\"\n* [[The Spencer Davis Group]] - \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\"\n* [[Hank Snow]] - \"[[The Golden Rocket (song)|Golden Rocket]]\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0078490|title=Who'll Stop the Rain}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|wholl_stop_the_rain|Who'll Stop the Rain}}\n\n{{Karel Reisz}}\n{{Robert Stone (novelist)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Who'll Stop The Rain}}\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1978 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films about the illegal drug trade]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Karel Reisz]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on military novels]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mexico]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War films]]\n[[Category:Works by Robert Stone (novelist)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Laurence Rosenthal]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films about heroin addiction]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
