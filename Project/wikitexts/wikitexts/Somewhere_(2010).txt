The film follows Johnny Marco (played by [[Stephen Dorff]]), a newly famous actor, as he recuperates from a minor injury at the [[Chateau Marmont]], a well-known [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] retreat. Despite money, fame and professional success, Marco is trapped in an [[existential crisis]] and has an emotionally empty daily life. When his ex-wife suffers an unexplained breakdown and goes away, she leaves Cleo ([[Elle Fanning]]), their 11-year-old daughter, in his care. They spend time together and her presence helps Marco mature and accept adult responsibility. The film explores [[boredom|ennui]] among Hollywood stars, the father\u2013daughter relationship and offers an oblique comedy of show business, particularly Hollywood film-making and the life of a \"star\".\n\n''Somewhere'' premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] where it received the [[Golden Lion]] award for best picture. Critical opinion was generally positive. Critics praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy for a handful of characters, but some felt that ''Somewhere'' repeated themes in Coppola's previous work or that its [[protagonist]] was less than sympathetic. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the film opens a black [[Ferrari]] circles on a race track in the desert, roaring in and out of the shot. When it eventually stops, Johnny Marco steps out. Marco is a recently divorced Hollywood actor who, despite his rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the [[Chateau Marmont]] in Los Angeles, where he is nursing a broken wrist in a plaster arm cast. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy, a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much of his time alone, driving his car, drinking beer and taking pills, watching a pair of pole-dancing twins perform in his rooms, and having casual sex with various women and aspiring starlets.<ref name='Ebert'>Ebert, R.

Cleo's stay changes his lifestyle little at first. They spend time together in his room and he brings her with him on a publicity trip to [[Milan]], where they stay in a lavish hotel suite and he has a blonde woman as an overnight guest. He is awarded with a \"[[Telegatto]]\" on a television show in which local celebrities play themselves. He helps Cleo prepare for summer camp, takes her on a gambling trip to [[Las Vegas]], and hires a helicopter to drop her off at the camp. After their time together, Johnny's fatherly emotions emerge and force him to re-assess his otherwise \"successful\" life. He calls his ex-wife and tearfully breaks down, admitting to his inadequacies and unhappiness. His ex-wife seems indifferent and declines his request to come see him. Johnny checks out of the hotel, promising not to return, and drives his Ferrari into the countryside. Eventually, he stops by the roadside and gets out, leaving behind his Ferrari and walking down the highway with a faint smile on his face.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Johnny Marco\n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Cleo\n* [[Chris Pontius]] as Sammy, a fellow actor and childhood friend of Johnny\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as actress playing co-star to Johnny\n* [[Kristina and Karissa Shannon]] as pole-dancing twins\n\n==Production==\n[[File:ChateauMarmont 01.jpg|thumb|''Somewhere'' was set in and filmed on location at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles.]]\nScenes from the film are said to be inspired by the director's childhood experiences as the daughter of [[Francis Ford Coppola]].<ref name=\"Corriere\">{{cite journal|last=Grassi |first=Giovanni |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/agosto/26/Sofia_Coppola_mio_nuovo_film_co_9_090826048.shtml |title=Sofia Coppola: il mio nuovo film sulle orme del Fellini pi\u00f9 dark |journal=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=August 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401061319/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/agosto/26/Sofia_Coppola_mio_nuovo_film_co_9_090826048.shtml |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |language=it |url-status=live }}</ref> She recalls sampling all the [[gelato]] flavors on a Milanese hotel's room service menu, a trip to Italy, a helicopter ride, and though she said there was a \"personal connection\" to the film, she denied it was an autobiography.

''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. ''Somewhere'' examines similar themes of success and isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from [[anhedonia]], the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. \"He believes he's nothing\", summarized film critic [[Roger Ebert]], \"and it appears he's correct\".<ref name='Ebert'/> The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track in and out of a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of [[ennui]]. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations.<ref name='Scott'/> Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, \"so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that gives you a chance to take a breath\".<ref name='Keough'/>\n\nThe Chateau Marmont, a well-known retreat for Hollywood celebrities, is the film's setting and can be \"either a paradise of easy wish-fulfillment or a purgatory of celebrity anomie\" ([[A.O. Scott]]), but Coppola subtly conveys the emptiness of Marco's situation without denying its appeal.<ref name='Scott'>Scott, A.O.

''Somewhere'' presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries. While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of \"star life\", Coppola's feature differs in its emotional depth.<ref name='Scott'/> She wanted to depict Marco working, but not on a film set. Instead he is shown giving interviews, being photographed, attending an awards ceremony in Italy, and having special effects make-up applied.
