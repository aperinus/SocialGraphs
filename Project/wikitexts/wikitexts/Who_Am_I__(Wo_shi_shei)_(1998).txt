({{zh|first=t|t=\u6211\u662f\u8ab0|s=\u6211\u662f\u8c01}}, also known as '''''Jackie Chan's Who Am I?''''') is a 1998 Hong Kong [[action comedy film]] directed by [[Benny Chan (film director)|Benny Chan]] and [[Jackie Chan]], who also starred in the lead role. The film was released in Hong Kong on 17 January 1998. It is also Chan's second film to be scripted and shot in English, the first one being ''[[Mr. Nice Guy (1997 film)|Mr. Nice Guy]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSomewhere in the jungles of [[South Africa]] on Thanksgiving 1996, a multinational military unit named ''Special Force Unit'' ambushes a convoy and kidnaps several scientists working on a highly-volatile compound extracted from a recently discovered [[meteorite]]. Among the operatives is a [[Hong Kong]] national identified as \"[[Jackie Chan]]\". The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assigns Morgan to investigate the incident, unaware that he and newly retired General Sherman orchestrated the abduction for their personal profit. At the same time, the CIA assigns another operative in South Africa for a more covert operation. \n\nJackie wakes up in a tribal village somewhere in the African [[veld]]t, still recovering from injuries sustained in an accident he cannot remember. When asked for his name by the natives, he does not remember who he is and repeatedly asks himself, \"Who Am I?\". He is referred to as \"Who Am I?\" by the natives, as they think it is his name. The tribesmen show him the remains of a crashed helicopter and graves of those who perished aboard. \"Who Am I?\" spends weeks recuperating from his wounds and learning about the tribe's culture. After spotting [[rally car]]s from several miles away, \"Who Am I?\" bids the village farewell and ventures on a journey back to civilization. He befriends Japanese rally [[co-driver]] Yuki after saving her brother from a snake bite and offering to help them finish the race. When they reach [[Johannesburg]], \"Who Am I?\" meets Christine Stark, a journalist sent to interview him about his rally adventure. \n\nMorgan hears of \"Who Am I?\" and sends a hitman team to kill him. Morgan also pretends to be his ally, telling him to contact him if he is in danger. After escaping from the hitmen, Christine cracks a secret code written on a matchbook found on one of the dead operatives, which leads them to [[Rotterdam]], in the [[Netherlands]]. \"Who Am I?\" and Christine bid Yuki farewell and head for Rotterdam to find more answers to his identity. In Rotterdam, \"Who Am I?\" discovers that Christine is actually an undercover CIA agent who tapped his calls. Not knowing whom to trust, he battles Sherman's hitmen and sneaks into the ''Willemswerf'' skyscraper alone, where he discovers the masterminds behind the kidnapping of the scientists. \n\nIt is revealed that Morgan and General Sherman are about to sell the extraterrestrial compound to an influential arms dealer named Armano. While waiting for the online [[wire transfer]] to finish, the three men leave the conference room for a coffee break \u2013 giving \"Who Am I?\" time to sneak in and steal the disc containing the compound information. He also cancels the transaction and sends the money to a children's charity, which infuriates Armano. Sherman and Armano send several men after \"Who Am I?\" to get the disc back. While in the process of escaping, \"Who Am I?\" defeats several hitmen and is found by Morgan. Once he discovers Morgan's betrayal, \"Who Am I?\" tries to kill Morgan, but is interrupted by Morgan's hitmen, who also try to take back the disc. \"Who Am I?\" fights them off and recovers the disk, but Morgan flees. \"Who Am I?\" regroups with Christine, who calls for the execution of a \"Plan B\". Several CIA agents join the pursuit of Morgan, cornering him on the [[Erasmusbrug|Erasmus Bridge]] in cooperation with the [[Royal Netherlands Marine Corps]]. Christine takes Morgan into custody and asks \"Who Am I?\" if he has the disc. He throws the disc off the bridge and tells Christine that he will return to Africa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Jackie Chan / Who Am I?\n* [[Michelle Ferre]] as Christine Stark\n* [[Mirai Yamamoto]] as Yuki Ohsato\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as General Sherman\n* [[Ron Smerczak]] as CIA Agent Morgan\n* [[David Vlok]] as Morgan's head assassin\n* Mike Ian Lambert as Peter (Morgan's hitman)\n* [[Ron Smoorenburg]] as Morgan's [[taekwondo]] hitman\n* Kwan Yung as Morgan's [[Choy Li Fut|Cai Li Fo]] hitman\n* Yanick Mbali as Baba\n* [[Washington Sixolo]] as Village chief\n* Tom Pompert as CIA chairman\n* Glory Simon as CIA secretary\n* Chip Bray as Armano\n* [[Frank Opperman (South African actor)|Frank Opperman]] as Internal security\n\n===Jackie Chan Stunt Team===\n* Andy Cheng\n* Rocky Lai\n* Nicky Li\n* Chan Man Ching\n* Sam Wong\n* Kwan Yung\n* Bradley James Allan\n* Paul Andreovski\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Willemswerf 2.jpg|thumb|Willemswerf building]]\n''Who Am I?'' was shot on locations in [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Netherlands]] between February and March 1997. The film features several landmarks such as [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] in [[South Africa]],  [[Erasmusbrug|Erasmus Bridge]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Beurstraverse (which was portrayed by the film makers as being in Johannesburg), the [[Cube house]]s and the Willemswerf building (which served as the headquarters of the villains and from the side of which, \"Who Am I?\" escaped by sliding to the ground). Dutch city [[Dordrecht]] was also used as a location on the Voorstraat, de Vleeshouwersstraat as well as the fountains by Hans Petri in front of the former Refaja hospital.\n\nThe film also features an elaborate chase scene involving the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution#Evolution IV|Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV GSR]] and a pack of chasing [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|BMW 3 series (E36)]], in which Jackie, Yuki, and Christine (in the Evolution) attempt to escape from their captors. Several memorable stunts in the Evolution IV were featured, including a spin parking manoeuvre, market chase, and flipping the car onto its side and roof. In the making-of documentary, the team outlined the numerous Lancer Evolutions that were used for the entire sequence due to the harsh physical challenges presented by the stunts. The use of the Evolution IV was consistent with the ongoing presence and sponsorship of Mitsubishi in Jackie Chan's films of that era.\n\n==Box office==\nIn Hong Kong, ''Who Am I?'' grossed HK$38,852,845 during its theatrical run.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Who Am I? |url=https://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=8330 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie Database]] |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref> In China, it grossed {{CNY|80 million|link=yes}} at the box office.<ref name=\"china\">{{cite web |date=16 August 2010 |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c9\u56de\uff1a\u4e2d\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3143 |access-date=29 November 2018 |website=KungFu Tube |language=ja}}</ref> In Taiwan, it sold 155,211 tickets and grossed {{TWD|35,540,820}}.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=1998 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a98.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010422190655/cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a98.htm |archive-date=22 April 2001 |access-date=20 April 2022 |website=[[National Chengchi University]] |language=zh}}</ref> In South Korea, film sold 193,293 tickets in [[Seoul City]]<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc601\ud654\uc815\ubcf4 |trans-title=Movie Information |url=https://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do |website=KOBIS |publisher=[[Korean Film Council]] |language=ko |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref> and 579,879 tickets nationwide, grossing {{US$|2.2 million}}.<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |date=5 September 2010 |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |access-date=7 December 2018 |website=KungFu Tube |language=ja}}</ref> In Europe, the film sold 157,427 tickets in Germany,<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |title=Wo shi shei (Who Am I?) - Germany |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=16720&view=4 |website=JP's Box-Office |language=fr |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref> and 73,101 tickets in other European countries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |title=Ngo si sui |url=https://lumiere.obs.coe.int/movie/12416# |website=[[LUMIERE]] |access-date=29 April 2022}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Box office territory|Market]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Box office]] gross revenue\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[List of films by box office admissions|Ticket sales]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Local currency\n!

This takes away the \"big reveal\" effect of what actually happened with Jackie and his men.\n* \"Who Am I?\"'s interaction with the African tribe has been reduced dramatically. Cuts include a scene in which he asks the tribal boy, Baba, how many days it takes to walk to civilization; a scene where he and Baba run away from a lioness after he picks up a lion cub; a scene showing the tribe's farewell ceremony for \"Who Am I?\"'s journey; and a scene in which he performs an interpretation of the tribal dance.\n* The rally race scene has been shortened.\n* A scene where \"Who Am I?\" recovers feeling in his mouth (as he chewed herbal leaves into an anesthetic to cure Yuki's brother's snake bite) and explains his situation to Yuki has been cut.\n* All but two instant replay shots (where Yuki, \"Who Am I?\" and Christine drive through a fruit stand, and where \"Who Am I?\" narrowly misses falling furniture in Rotterdam) have been deleted.\n\nUnlike other domestic releases of Jackie Chan's films, this version of ''Who Am I?'' retains the film's original musical score. Also, the U.S. release is the only cut which contains Jackie Chan's original spoken English during his time with the African tribe. The uncut HK releases have dubbed it in Cantonese.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nThe Hong Kong Universe Laser DVD (now out of print) contains the film as it was originally intended. The \"double-cross\" scene is not shown until during the interrogation scene as a \"revelation flashback.\" It is meant to be a mystery as to what happened until the viewer sees these flashbacks. It also contains \"Who Am I?\"'s full interaction with the African tribe. However, his English dialogue during this interaction is dubbed into Cantonese during this part. There are English subtitles provided for the whole film. The presentation is not anamorphic, however.\n\n===Japan===\n[[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Japan]] has released two DVD editions of the film: the single-disc DVD contains the original Hong Kong cut of the film with an anamorphic presentation, but with no English subtitles, and it retains the Cantonese dub of Chan during the African tribe scenes. The two-disc anamorphic edition contains both versions of the film, with English subtitles for the U.S. cut.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://warnerbros.co.jp/home_entertainment/detail.php?title_id=1395 |title=WHO AM I?\u3000\u30d5\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30e0\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\uff1f  |publisher=[[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.
