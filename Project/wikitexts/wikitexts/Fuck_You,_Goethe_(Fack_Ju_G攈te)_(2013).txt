The film was produced by [[Rat Pack Filmproduktion]] in coproduction with [[Constantin Film]].\n\n''Fack ju G\u00f6the'' premiered on 29 October 2013 in [[Munich]], and was subsequently released in cinemas on 7 November 2013. It was released in the United States under the title ''Suck Me Shakespeer''.<ref name=\"Suck Me Shakespeer\">{{cite web|title=Suck Me Shakespeer|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2987732/combined|website=IMDB|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nBank robber Zeki M\u00fcller has just been let out of prison. Upon his release, he goes to retrieve the money he stole in order to repay a debt, but his friend buried it in a construction site. During Zeki's time in prison, the construction project was completed and his money is now buried beneath the new gymnasium at the Goethe [[Gesamtschule]]. In order to obtain the money, Zeki applies for the vacant position of a deceased janitor. However, due to a misunderstanding, he is given a job as a substitute teacher.\n\nElisabeth \"Lisi\" Schnabelstedt is a student teacher at the Goethe Gesamtschule, her former high school, because she has guardianship over her younger sister, Laura. Lisi does not impose the necessary authority to manage the students successfully.\n\nWhen Ingrid Leimbach-Knorr, homeroom teacher of class 10B, attempts suicide, the management of the difficult class goes to Lisi Schnabelstedt, although the class's brutal pranks upon the new teacher quickly reduces her to tears. Zeki takes over as the substitute homeroom teacher for Lisi's former seventh grade class. In order to regain his money, Zeki works during the night in the cellar of the school on a tunnel leading to the buried money. He also copies Lisi's diploma because he does not have a high school or college education, which eventually becomes known to Lisi. She then [[blackmail]]s Zeki, allowing her to get her old seventh grade class back while Zeki assumes responsibility over class 10B.\n\nZeki is thrown out of his living situation at a strip club, and tries to sleep in Lisi's garage. When discovered, Lisi allows Zeki to live in her basement as long as he properly teaches class 10B instead of watching films every class period.\n\nThrough unconventional methods and Lisi's soft leadership, Zeki gains the respect of the class. Although Zeki begins his time as a teacher with draconian methods including shooting students with a paintball gun and holding a student underwater, he eventually takes a softer approach and convinces the students that they do not want to become drug dealers and dependent on welfare by taking them on a field trip to visit Zeki's acquaintances who live this lifestyle. He also becomes more involved in the school by taking over the leadership of the Drama Club, which performs a modern version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and helping out with the [[Jugend forscht]] group. Zeki, concerned about Lisi's image amongst the class, leads the class on an excursion to paint graffiti on a train, during which a student paints the title 'Fack ju G\u00f6hte'. As a result of this increased respect, Lisi passes her practical teaching exam with class 10B. In addition, Zeki arranges an affair for Lisi's little sister Laura with her crush Danger, as well as ensuring Lisi's continued legal guardianship of Laura by pretending to be Lisi's serious boyfriend when Laura's social worker comes to visit. Eventually Zeki finds the money in the tunnel, but the tunnel beneath the gymnasium causes the floor to break and allows Lisi to discover Zeki filling in the tunnel. When Lisi learns about Zeki's past as a criminal, she threatens to call the police if he does not leave his job and her home at once. Zeki, out of options, agrees to drive the get away car for a bank heist. As Zeki's class is about to take their final exam in German, they all take out their motivation photos. A student informs Lisi that Zeki's motivation photo is in his desk. When Lisi opens the desk, she discovers that his motivation for becoming a better person is her. A friend of Zeki's is able to convince that Zeki wants to change his ways for her.\n\nZeki doesn't follow through with the heist because three students stop him to ask if he will be their homeroom teacher next year and he sees the train with the 'Fack ju G\u00f6the' graffiti. He sends Lisi a dress and an invitation to the prom and reports himself to the school principal. The principal wants to keep him and even hands him a falsified high school diploma with a 2.0 GPA. She informs Zeki that the class 10B has drastically improved and if they continue to work towards their high school diplomas, the school will become the best in the city. Their marks in German, previously 5's and 6's (equivalent to F's), have now become better than 3's (C's).\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Elyas M'Barek]]: Zeki M\u00fcller\n* [[Karoline Herfurth]]: Elisabeth 'Lisi' Schnabelstedt\n* [[Katja Riemann]]: Principal Gudrun Gerster\n* [[Jana Pallaske]]: Charlie\n* [[Alwara H\u00f6fels]]: Caro Meyer\n* [[Jella Haase]]: Chantal Ackermann\n* [[Max von der Groeben]]: Daniel 'Danger' Becker\n* [[Anna Lena Klenke]]: Laura Schnabelstedt\n* Gizem Emre: Zeynep\n* Aram Arami: Burak\n* [[Uschi Glas]]: Ingrid Leimbach-Knorr\n* Margarita Broich: Frau Sieberts\n* [[Farid Bang]]: Paco\n* Christian N\u00e4the: Biology teacher\n* Bernd Stegemann: Herr Gundlach\n* Erdal Y\u0131ld\u0131z: Attila\n* [[Laura Osswald]]: Kindergarten teacher\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe role of Zeki M\u00fcller was written by Bora Da\u011ftekin for Elyas M'Barek. M'Barek and Da\u011ftekin had previously worked together on the television series ''[[Schulm\u00e4dchen]]'', ''[[Doctor's Diary]]'', ''[[T\u00fcrkisch f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger]]'' and its film adaptation. Producer Lena Sch\u00f6mann praised M'Barek for his 'unbelievable discipline', as the actor had worked out five times a week with a personal trainer, losing eight kilos, months before filming began. M'Barek had just trained his upper body for ''T\u00fcrkisch f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger''.<ref name=\"presse\">Press material of ''Fack ju G\u00f6hte''</ref>\n\nThe main female role was played by [[Grimme-Preis|Grimme Award winner]] Karoline Herfurth, who after ''[[M\u00e4dchen, M\u00e4dchen]]'' and its 2004 sequel was only seen rarely in comedies. Sch\u00f6mann gave his reasons for Herfurth's choice, stating that she 'has a fantastic instinct for comedy and timing'.<ref name=\"presse\" /> The role of school principal went to Katja Riemann, who had just made a guest-appearance in the film of the series ''T\u00fcrkisch f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger''.\n\nA student role was given to Max von der Groeben, who received a 'best young actor' award at the presentation of the 2013 [[Goldene Kamera|Goldenen Kamera]]. Jella Haase, who appears as Chantal, had previously been awarded the ''Studio Hamburg Nachwuchspreis'' (Studio Hamburg Young Performer's Award) and the ''G\u00fcnter-Strack-Fernsehpreis'' (G\u00fcnter Strack Television Prize) for best actress.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:FJG-Set.jpg|thumb|Set of the Goethe-Gesamtschule in Unterhaching on the first day of shooting]]\n\nFilming took place mainly in [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]]. The ''Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium'' in [[Unterhaching]] served as the backdrop of the Goethe-[[Gesamtschule]] in the film. The school had been used before in films, such as ''Schule'', ''Die Wolke'', and the [[ZDF]] television series ''[[Klimawechsel]]''. Filming in Berlin was done, among other places, on the [[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]] and in an apartment block area in [[Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln]]. Also, the swimming pool scenes were shot in Berlin. The prison scenes were shot in a former [[East Germany|East German]] prison in Keibelstra\u00dfe in Berlin.<ref name=\"presse\" />\n\nFilming commenced on 28 April 2013 and lasted for forty-one days.<ref name=\"presse\" />\n\n== Release ==\nOn 28 July 2013, four teaser trailers were released, while the official trailer was released on 10 October 2013.
