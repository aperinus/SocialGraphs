Retrieved on 2-13-2009</ref> written and directed by [[Steve De Jarnatt]], and starring [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] and [[Mare Winningham]]. The film takes place mostly in real time. It is titled after the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where most of the action takes place.<ref>{{AFI film|id=58198|title=Miracle Mile}}.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in a single day and night. The film opens with the two main characters, Harry ([[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]]) and Julie ([[Mare Winningham]]), meeting at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and immediately falling in love. After spending the afternoon together, they arrange to meet after her shift ends at midnight at a local coffee shop, but a power failure means Harry's alarm fails to wake him and Julie leaves for home.\n\nWhen Harry awakes that night he realizes what has happened and rushes to the shop, arriving at 4 AM. Harry tries to call Julie on a payphone, but only reaches her answering machine, where he leaves an apology. When the phone rings moments later he picks it up, hearing a frantic man named Chip telling his father that war is about to break out in less than seventy minutes. When Harry finally gets a chance to talk and asks who is calling, Chip realizes he has dialed the wrong area code. Chip then pleads with Harry to call his father and apologize for some past wrong before he is being confronted and presumably shot. An unfamiliar voice picks up the phone and tells Harry to forget everything he heard \"and go back to sleep\" before disconnecting.\n\nHarry, confused and not entirely convinced of the reality of the information, wanders back into the diner and tells the other customers what he has heard. As the patrons scoff at his story, one of them, a mysterious businesswoman named Landa ([[Denise Crosby]]), calls a number of politicians in Washington on her wireless phone and finds that they are all suddenly heading for \"the extreme [[Southern Hemisphere]]\". After Harry tells her some launch codes that Chip told him, she verifies that they are real and, convinced of the danger, immediately charters private jets out of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to a compound in a region in [[Antarctica]] with no rainfall. Most of the customers and staff leave with her in the owner's delivery van. When the owner refuses to make any stops, Harry, unwilling to leave without Julie, arranges to meet the group at the airport and jumps from the truck.\n\nHarry is helped and hindered by various strangers, who are initially unaware of the impending apocalypse. In the process he inadvertently causes several deaths and is deeply shaken by that, yet still he goes on. When he finds Julie and later tells her, she notes that there is no confirmation of the attack. Desperate to reach the airport and not having a car, Harry finds a helicopter pilot ([[Brian Thompson]]) and tells him to meet them on the roof of the [[5900 Wilshire|Mutual Benefit Life Building]], where Landa ordered a helicopter and a large amount of supplies to be delivered. Julie has also tried to find a pilot on her own, and in the moments it takes to find her, Los Angeles descends into violent chaos. There is still no confirmation any of this is real, and Harry wonders if he has sparked a massive false panic in the example of [[Chicken Little]]. However, when he uses a phone booth to contact the father of the man who called him (using the number of the booth and the area code the man was trying to use), he reaches a man who says his son is a soldier. Harry tries to pass on the message he was given, but the man hangs up before Harry finishes.\n\nWhen they reach the top of the Mutual Benefit building they find the pad empty, with only Landa's drunk co-worker ([[Kurt Fuller]]) on the roof. Any doubts about a false alarm are eliminated when a missile can be seen streaking across the sky. As they fear the end, the helicopter suddenly returns with the pilot badly wounded but fulfilling his promise to come back for them. After they lift off from the roof, several warheads hit and the nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the detonations causes the helicopter to crash into the La Brea pits. As the helicopter sinks and the cabin fills with natural asphalt tar, Harry tries to comfort a hysterical Julie by saying someday their fossils will be found and they will probably be put in a museum, or maybe they will take a direct hit and be turned into diamonds. Julie, accepting her fate, calms down and takes comfort in Harry's words, and the movie fades out as the tar fills the compartment. A final explosion seems to imply a direct hit has taken place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Harry Washello\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Julie Peters\n* [[John Agar]] as Ivan Peters\n* Lou Hancock as Lucy Peters\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Wilson\n* [[Kelly Jo Minter]] as Charlotta\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Gerstead\n* [[Brian Thompson]] as Helicopter Pilot\n* [[Denise Crosby]] as Landa\n* [[Robert DoQui]] as Fred the Cook\n* [[O-Lan Jones]] as Susie the Waitress\n* Claude Earl Jones as Harlan\n* [[Alan Rosenberg]] as Mike\n* Danny De La Paz as Roger the Transvestite\n* [[Earl Boen]] as Drunk Man in Diner\n* [[Raphael Sbarge]] as Chip ''(voice)''\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as Old Woman in Diner \n* [[Diane Delano]] as Stewardess\n* [[Edward Bunker]] as Nightwatchman\n* [[Peter Berg]] as Band Member\n* [[Richard Biggs]] as Brian Jones\n* [[Jenette Goldstein]] as Beverly Hills Chick #1 \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nBefore ''Miracle Mile'' was made, its production had been legendary in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for ten years.<ref name= \"richardson\">{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=John H.|title=''Miracle Mile'' Made with Slowly Measured Steps|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/100553558/miracle-mile/|date=May 28, 1989}}</ref> In 1983, it had been chosen by ''American Film'' magazine as one of the ten best unmade screenplays.<ref name= \"richardson\"/> [[Steve De Jarnatt]] wrote it just out of the [[American Film Institute]] for [[Warner Brothers]] with the hope of directing it as well.

It was this great adventure, but they wanted it to have a happy ending. But he stuck it out, and luckily he stuck it out long enough that I was old enough to play the part. [Laughs.]  So I got to do it, and we did it at a time when there really was no green screen for special effects. You had to shoot what was there. It's amazing how dated that film looks now, because of our ability to do things technically now. I mean, it really looks antiquated. Mare Winningham is one of the greatest actresses ever. It was eight weeks of night shooting, though, so you'd be driving home from work at, like, 6 in the morning, having had a wrap beer, and then you're suddenly going, \"Oh my God, what do people think of somebody having a beer at 6 in the morning whenever everyone else is on their way to work?
