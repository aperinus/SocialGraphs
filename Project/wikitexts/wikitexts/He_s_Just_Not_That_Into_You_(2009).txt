It follows nine people and their varying romantic problems. Gigi, a common thread amongst the characters, is followed more closely than the other eight and has a more developed storyline as she consistently misreads all of her romantic partners' behaviors. She meets Alex, who helps her to interpret signs given to her by her dates.\n\nThe [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and [[Justin Long]]. The film was produced by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Flower Films]], the production company owned by Barrymore, who was executive producer.\n\nProduction began in [[Baltimore]] in 2007. The film was released on February 6, 2009 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] to mixed reviews. It grossed $27,785,487 on its opening weekend and over $178,866,158 worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1784251905/|title=He's Just Not That Into You|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Gigi, Conor and Alex===\nIn [[Baltimore]], Gigi repeatedly [[Friend zone|misreads]] the romantic interest of her dates.\n\nFollowing a tepid date with real estate agent Conor Barry, Gigi is befriended by bar owner Alex, who suggests she misinterprets romantic signals. As their friendship continues, Gigi interprets his helpfulness as a sign he is attracted to her, but Alex rebuffs her, chastising her for ignoring his advice.\n\nAs Gigi moves on from Alex, he realizes he is in love with her. After leaving several unanswered messages, Alex arrives at Gigi's apartment after she returns from a pleasant date, and declares his love and they end up kissing.\n\n===Janine, Ben, and Anna===\nGigi's co-worker, Janine Gunders, obsesses over her home renovations while her husband, Ben, becomes attracted to Anna Marks, a [[yoga]] instructor and aspiring singer. Ben and Anna pursue a flirtatious friendship under the pretense of him helping her establish a singing career. Ben reveals that he only married Janine after she delivered an ultimatum, saying that they should marry or break up. Ben agrees to only be friends with Anna, but she continues her pursuit until they sleep together.\n\nFinding cigarette butts hidden in the back yard, Janine accuses Ben of smoking again, citing her father's death from [[Lung cancer#smoking|lung cancer]]. Ben blames the workmen at their house. During a tense home improvement shopping trip, Ben confesses his infidelity. Devastated, Janine blames herself and wants to save their marriage; Ben seems less enthusiastic.\n\nLater, Anna and Ben begin having sex in his office, when he gropes and strips her to her lingerie. They are interrupted by Janine, who arrives hoping to spice up their marriage. Forced to hide in a closet and listen as Ben and Janine have sex, Anna afterward leaves in disgust, ending her affair with Ben. As Janine tidies up Ben's clothes at home, she discovers a pack of cigarettes and explodes in anger. When Ben returns home, Janine is gone, leaving his clothes folded on the staircase with a carton of cigarettes and a note asking for a divorce. Janine moves into an apartment to restart her life, and Anna is seen performing at an upscale nightclub. Alone, Ben buys beer at the same supermarket where he met Anna.\n\n===Conor, Anna, and Mary===\nAnna enjoys a close friendship with Alex's friend, Conor. Though Anna wants a casual relationship, Conor misinterprets her playful affection as romantic interest.\n\nAnna's friend, Mary Harris, works in advertising sales for a local gay newspaper and helps Conor promote his real estate business. Like Gigi, she meets many men, mostly online, but despite constantly monitoring her emails, pager, phone, and [[Myspace]] messages, her dates go nowhere.\n\nWhile Conor attempts to cultivate a gay clientele, two gay men explain how he is going wrong with Anna. Taking their advice, Conor declares his love to Anna. Feeling vulnerable after her falling out with Ben, Anna agrees to a more serious relationship. When Conor later proposes buying a house and moving in together, Anna admits she does not want to and they return to being just friends.\n\nMary later runs into Conor, recognizing him from his ad photo and having only spoken to him over the phone. They hit it off, and start dating.\n\n===Beth and Neil===\nGigi's co-worker, Beth Murphy, lives with her boyfriend Neil, a friend of Ben's. After seven years together, Beth wants to get married, but Neil opposes marriage. Gigi announces she will no longer misinterpret vague gestures and comments, and says that men who delay marrying likely never intend to. This spurs Beth to confront Neil, who remains adamant that he never wants to marry, and she breaks up with him.\n\nPreparations for her younger sister's wedding reopen the issue after Beth hears backhanded comments from various family members. During the reception, her father Ken suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Beth cares for him as he recuperates at home while her sisters wallow and their husbands remain glued to the television with constant takeout food, while refusing to help at all. Beth's patience wanes as the household grows more dysfunctional and the chores start to file. However, just when she's about to snap, she is shocked to find Niel, who learned of her father's heart attack and rushed over, finishing the dishes in a now clean kitchen, done the laundry, and restocked the fridge. They reconcile, with Beth assuring Neil that she wants him back without being married. Neil later proposes, and they wed aboard his sailboat.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:ScarlettJohanssonFeb2009.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Scarlett Johansson]] at the premiere of ''He's Just Not That Into You'']]\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Neil\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Beth\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Mary\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Janine\n* [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]] as Conor\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Ben\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Gigi\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Anna\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Ken Murphy\n* [[Justin Long]] as Alex\n* [[Wilson Cruz]] as Nathan\n* [[Hedy Burress]] as Laura\n* [[Sasha Alexander]] as Catharine\n* [[Leonardo Nam]] as Joshua\n* [[Busy Philipps]] as Kelli Ann\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], was selected for the setting of ''He's Just Not That Into You'' as an alternative to the common [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], or [[Los Angeles]] settings of romantic comedies.<ref name=\"Sun\">{{cite news |author=Chris Kaltenbach |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/bal-al.justnot01feb01,0,7113919.story |title=Baltimore Perfect Setting for 'He's Just Not That Into You' |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=2009-02-01 |access-date=2009-02-02}}</ref> In addition, screenwriter Marc Silverstein had lived in the city for several years prior to attending college.<ref name=\"Sun\"/> Exterior shots were filmed in the city for two weeks during November 2007.<ref name=\"Sun\" /> Interior scenes were filmed in Los Angeles.\n\nThe film was released on February 6, 2009, by [[Warner Bros.
