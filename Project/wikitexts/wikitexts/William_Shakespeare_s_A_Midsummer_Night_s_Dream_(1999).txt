It was written, directed and co-produced by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]]. The ensemble cast features [[Kevin Kline]] as Bottom, [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Rupert Everett]] as Titania and Oberon, [[Stanley Tucci]] as Puck, and [[Calista Flockhart]], [[Anna Friel]], [[Christian Bale]], and [[Dominic West]] as the four lovers.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1890s Monte Athena, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], young lovers Lysander and Hermia are forbidden to marry by her father Egeus, who has promised Hermia to Demetrius. Lysander and Hermia make plans to flee to the forest to escape the arrangement. Demetrius follows them, having been made aware of the plan by Helena, a young woman who is desperately in love with him. Once in the forest, they wander into the fairy world, ruled by Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of the fairies. Oberon and his servant sprite Puck cause mayhem among the lovers with a magic potion that causes both Lysander and Demetrius to fall in love with Helena, leading to a rift between all four that culminates (famously in this adaptation) in a mud-wrestling scene. Oberon then bewitches Titania with the same potion.\n\nMeanwhile, an acting troupe prepares a play for the entertainment of the Duke. The leader of the actors and the actors, including a weaver named Bottom, and Francis Flute take their rehearsal to the forest. The mischievous Puck magically enchants Bottom with the head of an ass and Bottom is then seen by the bewitched Titania. Titania woos Bottom in her bower, attended by fairies. Oberon tires of the sport and puts all to rights, pairing Lysander back with Hermia and Demetrius with Helena, and reconciling with his own queen, Titania.\n\nIn the final part, Bottom and his troupe of \"[[Mechanical (character)|rude Mechanicals]]\" perform their amateur play, based on the tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, before Duke Theseus, his wife Hippolyta, and the court, unintentionally producing a tragedy that turns to be a comedy.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Nick Bottom]]\n* [[Roger Rees]] as [[Peter Quince]]\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Francis Flute]]\n* [[Max Wright]] as [[Robin Starveling]]\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as [[Tom Snout]]\n* [[Gregory Jbara]] as [[Snug (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Snug]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Robin Goodfellow/Puck]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]]\n* [[Anna Friel]] as [[Hermia]]\n* [[Dominic West]] as [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]]\n* [[Calista Flockhart]] as [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]]\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Demetrius]]\n* [[David Strathairn]] as [[Theseus]]\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as [[Hippolyta#Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night's Dream|Hippolyta]]\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as [[Egeus]]\n* [[John Sessions]] as [[Philostrate]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was filmed on location in [[Lazio]] and [[Tuscany]], and at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The action of the play was transported from [[Athens]], [[Greece]], to a fictional Monte Athena, located in the Tuscan region of [[Italy]], although all textual mentions of Athens were retained.\n\nThe film made use of [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|incidental music for an 1843 stage production]] (including the famous ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]''), alongside operatic works from [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]] and [[Pietro Mascagni]].\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on November 30, 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videostoremag.com/content/new_video2.cfm?ID=699.00000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000127053537/http://www.videostoremag.com/content/new_video2.cfm?ID=699.00000|title=A Midsummer Night's Dream (Fox)|website=videostoremag.com|archive-date=January 27, 2000|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' holds a rating of 67% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] as of September 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090918-midsummer_nights_dream/ |title=A Midsummer Night's Dream Movie Reviews, Pictures |website=uk.rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2009-12-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318063332/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090918-midsummer_nights_dream/ |archive-date=2010-03-18 }}</ref> and a score of 61 on [[Metacritic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-midsummer-nights-dream |title=Midsummer Night's Dream, A |website=Metacritic.com |access-date=2009-12-25}}</ref> indicating generally favorable reviews. Many critics singled out [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] for particular praise.\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote:\n{{blockquote|Michael Hoffman's fussy production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is just such a parade of incongruities, with performances ranging from the sublime to the you-know-what ... Not even Michelle Pfeiffer's commanding loveliness as the fairy queen Titania, and her ability to speak of such things as 'my bower' with perfect ease, can offset the decision to have the actors grapple awkwardly with bicycles ... The hoodwinked characters of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' are meant to be mismatched much of the time. But not like this. The distraught Helena, played as a hand-waving, eye-rolling ditz by Calista Flockhart, hardly fits into the same film with David Strathairn's reserved Duke Theseus, or with Rupert Everett as a slinky Oberon. Everett, like the inspired Kevin Kline as the ham actor Bottom, is utterly at ease with this material in ways that many other cast members are not ... Though West and especially Ms. Friel approach their roles with gratifying ease, Bale is once again given the cheesecake treatment and little occasion to rise above it. This production tarts up the play any way it can ... The theatrical carryings-on of Bottom and company provide the film's best attempts at comedy. Staging a play about Pyramus and Thisbe with a troupe including Bill Irwin, Roger Rees and Sam Rockwell (as the beauteous heroine), Bottom's acting company delights its late-19th-century audience in ways Hoffman's film can only occasionally manage. In a completely unexpected turn, Rockwell moves the sceptical and bemused audience to tears as he performs Thisbe's scene reacting to the death of Pyramus, proving that he alone among the band of actors has any real talent for the craft.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/051499dream-film-review.html |first=Janet |last=Maslin |title='A Midsummer Night's Dream': A 'Dream' of Foolish Mortals |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 14, 1999}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote:\n{{blockquote|Michael Hoffman's new film of William Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (who else's?) is updated to the 19th century, set in Italy and furnished with bicycles and operatic interludes. But it is founded on Shakespeare's language and is faithful, by and large, to the original play... It's wonderful to behold Pfeiffer's infatuation with the donkey-eared Bottom, who she winds in her arms as 'doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently twist'; her love is so real, we almost believe it. Kline's Bottom tactfully humors her mad infatuation, good-natured and accepting. And Tucci's Puck suggests sometimes that he has a darker side, but it not so much malicious as incompetent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990514/REVIEWS/905140304/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |website=rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=May 14, 1999}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Peter Stack wrote:\n{{blockquote|Purists will quibble, but ''William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' is a playful, sexy piece of work - just what the Bard might have conjured up for a movie adaptation of his beloved spring-fever comedy. The film is over the top - and willfully so ... As might be expected, Kevin Kline steals the show with his hearty gifts for comedy ... Kline, a Shakespearean veteran, has that flourish, that golden touch. In his glorious way of overdoing it - turning the very notion of acting into farce - he embodies a supreme comic madness that is audacious yet embracing ... Michelle Pfeiffer plays it regal, pouty and come-hither as Titania. Her seduction of Bottom, turned to an ass under the spell of Puck (Stanley Tucci with horns and impish grin), is riotous ... A real surprise is the sly comic depth of Calista Flockhart's bicycle-riding Helena, miles from ''Ally McBeal'' ... Rupert Everett is imperious as Oberon, the jealous fairy king, and Tucci's Puck is amusingly tweaky as he keeps messing up his missions to drop magic nectar into lovers' eyes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/05/14/DD27854.DTL |first=Peter |last=Stack |title='Dream' Interpretation / Stellar cast adds comic madness to lush, over-the-top 'Midsummer' |date=May 14, 1999 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[Time Out New York]]'', [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] wrote:\n{{blockquote|A strangely uneven adaptation of the Bard's most famous comedy, Michael Hoffman's ''Dream'' is, if nothing else, admirable for its lack of a contrived gimmick. Yes, the story has been transplanted to Tuscany in the 1890s, and the cast is packed with big names, but Hoffman rightly treats the text as the real star of the show. The film soars when actors who remember that Shakespeare was primarily an entertainer carry the ball, but things get pretty turgid when the focus is on those who seem cowed by appearing in an adaptation of a Major Literary Classic.<ref>''Time Out New York, May 13\u201319, 1999, p. 100.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Jane Horwitz wrote:\n{{blockquote|Instead of Shakespeare's Athens, Hoffman dreams his ''Dream'' in a gorgeous Tuscan hill town at the turn of the century, with production designer Luciana Arrighi and costume designer Gabriella Pescucci creating a luscious milieu of dusty green shutters, olive groves and vineyards reminiscent of the 1986 Merchant-Ivory gem ''A Room With a View'' ... some in the cast negotiate Shakespeare's lines better than others. Kevin Kline's stage savvy serves him especially well as a movie-stealing Bottom.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/midsummernightsdreamhorwitz.htm |first=Jane |last=Horwitz |title='A Midsummer Night's Dream' (PG-13) |website=washingtonpost.com |date=May 14, 1999}}</ref>}}\n\nAlso in the ''Washington Post'', [[Desson Howe]] wrote:\n{{blockquote|After watching ''William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Michael Hoffman's adaptation of the romantic comedy, I'm left with more admiration than fairy dust. But it was pleasurable all the same... Kline and Flockhart do most of the pedaling. When Kline gets goofy \u2013 as he did in ''A Fish Called Wanda'' and ''In & Out'', he's an irresistible, madcap Errol Flynn, twisting his good looks into hilarious contortions. And Flockhart exudes a wonderful vulnerability and sense of comic timing, as she pursues Demetrius, suffering all manner of indignity and incredulity along the way.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/midsummernightsdreamhowe.htm |first=Desson |last=Howe |title='A Midsummer Night's Dream' (PG-13) |website=washingtonpost.com |date=May 14, 1999}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Emanuel Levy]] described the film as a \"whimsical, intermittently enjoyable but decidedly unmagical version of the playwright's wild romantic comedy ... There is not much chemistry between Pfeiffer and Everett, nor between Pfeiffer and Kline, particularly in their big love scene. Kline overacts physically and emotionally, Flockhart is entertaining in a broad manner, and Pfeiffer renders a strenuously theatrical performance. Overall, the Brits give more coherent and resonant performances, especially Friel and West as the romantic couple, a restrained Everett as Oberon, and Rees as the theatrical manager.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=review&reviewid=VE1117914118&categoryid=31&cs=1 |first=Emanuel |last=Levy |title=William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream Review |work=Variety.com |date=May 10, 1999}}</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' wrote that \"this ''Dream'' is middlebrow and unashamed of it.
