The 20th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a [[butler]] has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of [[Phil Harris]], [[Eva Gabor]], [[Hermione Baddeley]], Dean Clark, [[Sterling Holloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Roddy Maude-Roxby]].\n\nIn 1962, ''The Aristocats'' project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney.27s Wonderful World of Color .281961.E2.80.931969.29|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, [[Walt Disney]] suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] as ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967) advanced into production. When ''The Jungle Book'' was nearly complete, Disney appointed [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] to develop preliminary work on ''The Aristocats'', making it the last film project to be approved by Disney personally before his death in December 1966. Longtime Disney collaborators [[Sherman Brothers|Robert and Richard Sherman]] composed multiple songs for the film, though only two made it in the finished product.\n\n''The Aristocats'' was released on December 24, 1970, becoming a commercial success but receiving mixed reviews. A live-action remake is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. Current count is 534 words.-->\n\nIn 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three [[kitten]]s (Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse) live in [[Paris, France|Paris]] with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. The cats are pampered pets that live a luxurious lifestyle, and are very cultured in art and music like their owner.\n\nOne day, while preparing her [[will (law)|will]] with elderly lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares that her vast fortune will be first left to her cats, then revert to Edgar once they all pass away. Edgar overhears this through a [[speaking tube]] and, after erroneously calculating that he will die before he can inherit, plots to eliminate the cats. He sedates them by putting [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] in a dish of cream, then drives them on his motorcycle out to the countryside in a basket. There, he is ambushed by two [[hound]]s named Napoleon and Lafayette, losing his hat, [[sidecar]], umbrella, shoes, and the basket before escaping. The cats are left stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.\n\nIn the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] in a milk truck before being chased out by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad [[Trestle bridge|trestle]], the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, and Marie falls into a river. O'Malley immediately dives in and rescues her, and is himself rescued by Amelia and Abigail Gabble, two British geese on holiday. The geese lead the cats to the outskirts of Paris, then depart to deal with their inebriated Uncle Waldo. Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the countryside to retrieve his possessions\u2014the only evidence that can incriminate him\u2014from Napoleon and Lafayette and, after some difficulty, ultimately succeeds.\n\nTraveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet up with O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the song \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\". After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's marriage proposal. The next day, Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion. Edgar finds them before Madame does, and places them in a sack, deciding to ship them to [[Timbuktu]].\n \nRoquefort catches up with O'Malley at Duchess\u2019 instruction, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, sending Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Though he struggles to explain the situation to the alley cats, Roquefort successfully brings them to O'Malley's aid. O'Malley, the alley cats, and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself, never to be seen again.\n\nThe Aristocats return to Madame Adelaide, who, ignorant of the real reason for Edgar's departure, rewrites her will to exclude him. After adopting O'Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation, housing Paris' stray cats in the mansion. Scat Cat and his gang are the first to move in, and reprise their song so loudly that the two hound dogs can hear it out in the countryside.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Duchess \u2013 Madame Adelaide's refined and elegant Turkish Angora cat and mother of the three kittens, who believes she is forced to choose between loyalty to Madame and her own attachment to Thomas O'Malley at the end of the film.

He is also a talented painter and is loosely based on French painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n* Liz English as Marie \u2013 the middle kitten and the only girl.

Whenever his cohort Lafayette makes a suggestion, Napoleon insists that he is in charge, then adopts Lafayette's suggestion as his own.\n* [[George Lindsey]] as Lafayette \u2013 a [[Basset Hound]] and Napoleon's companion. He sometimes proves smarter than Napoleon but is also more timid.\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille \u2013 a wealthy former opera singer and the owner of Duchess and her kittens.\n* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Georges Hautecourt \u2013 Madame Adelaide\u2019s eccentric lawyer, who is also her oldest friend. He is extremely lively, despite his advanced age.\n* [[Nancy Kulp]] as Frou-Frou \u2013 Madame Adelaide\u2019s carriage horse and Roquefort's companion, who subdues Edgar. [[Ruth Buzzi]] provided her singing voice.\n* [[Monica Evans]] as Abigail Gabble \u2013 Amelia's twin sister, a goose who befriends the cats.\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Amelia Gabble \u2013 Abigail's twin sister, a goose who befriends the cats.\n* [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] as Uncle Waldo \u2013 the drunken gander uncle of Abigail and Amelia. This was Thompson's final film role.\n* [[Peter Renaday]] as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nOn December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney.27s Wonderful World of Color .281961.E2.80.931969.29|Wonderful World of Color]]'' television program. By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=193}} However, Tytle felt that the [[London]] setting had added a significant element to ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961) and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants\u2014a butler and a maid\u2014who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=193}} [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Fran\u00e7oise Rosay]] were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=141}} A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris. During the filming of ''[[Escapade in Florence]]'' (1962), McGowan brought Tytle the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=193}} \n\n[[File:Phil Harris 1956.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Before his death in 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris (pictured here) to voice Thomas O'Malley.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Howard|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19801208&id=SfVSAAAAIBAJ&pg=7155,2696962&hl=en|title=An encore purr-formance for 'The Aristocats'|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|page=4C|via=[[Google News Archive]]|date=December 8, 1980|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBy August 1962, they sent the completed story treatment to Burbank, where it was returned as \"rejected\" by the Disney studios. McGowan, upset at the rejection, suggested selling the treatment elsewhere, but later learned Disney was staying at the [[The Connaught (hotel)|Connaught]] in London. McGowan then slipped the treatment into an envelope for Disney to read at the hotel desk.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=193}} Disney contacted McGowan, stating he had liked the treatment and would meet with Tytle in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. On August 29, during their flight back to London, Disney told Tytle to purchase the story for a live-action theatrical film, with McGowan as director. Disney also recommended further story revisions, one of which was eliminating one of the kitten characters.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=194}} \n\nThe script revisions were later made in January and February 1963. In June 1963, Rowe had written a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept. However, the project was temporarily shelved, and in August 1963, Tytle suggested that ''The Aristocats'' should be reworked into an animated feature, to which Disney agreed. At Disney's recommendation, Tytle presented the project to [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], who was directing ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), who agreed it would work as an animated film.{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=195}}<ref name=jimhill /> For that reason, Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with ''The Jungle Book'' (1967).<ref name=\"Ottawa\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19701218&id=kr0yAAAAIBAJ&pg=2560,1843732&hl=en|title=The Aristocats for Christmas|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|page=28|via=Google News Archive|date=December 18, 1970|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> In April 1964, story artist Otto Englander was assigned to work on the project. In November 1964, during a story meeting, Disney felt the cats should talk amongst themselves but never in front of the humans, in a similar approach as in ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' (1961).{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=195}} Because of the production delays, studio producer [[Bill Anderson (producer)|Bill Anderson]] advised Tytle to centralize his efforts on [[Live action|live action projects]], and he was subsequently replaced by [[Winston Hibler]].{{sfn|Tytle|1997|p=196}}\n\nIn 1966, Disney assigned [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] to determine whether ''The Aristocats'' would be suitable for an animated feature.

Instead, the film would be retooled as an adventure comedy in the vein of ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians'' (1961). Furthermore, the character Elvira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by [[Elsa Lanchester]], was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central villain in order to better simplify the storyline.<ref name=jimhill>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jim|title=Would Walt's version of \"The Aristocats\" have been a bigger hit for Disney Studios?|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2012/08/21/would-walt-s-version-of-quot-the-aristocats-quot-have-been-a-bigger-hit-for-disney-studios.aspx#sthash.vb0zEDZT.dpuf|website=Jim Hill Media|date=August 21, 2012|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAs with ''The Jungle Book'' (1967), the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors.<ref name=\"Ottawa\" /> In 1966, Disney contacted [[Phil Harris]] to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O'Malley.
