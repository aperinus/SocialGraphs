Gary Gray]] and written by [[Chris Morgan (filmmaker)|Chris Morgan]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Furious 7]]'' (2015) and the eighth installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. The film stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Nathalie Emmanuel]], [[Elsa Pataky]], [[Kurt Russell]], and [[Charlize Theron]]. In the film, [[Dominic Toretto]] has settled down with his wife [[Letty Ortiz]], until [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] Cipher coerces him into working for her and turns him against his team, forcing them to find Dom and take down Cipher.\n\nThe eighth installment was planned since 2014, and plot details were first announced in March 2015 when Diesel appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and announced that the film would be set in New York City. Preparations for the film began immediately after the release of ''Furious 7'', with Diesel, Morgan, and producer [[Neal H. Moritz]] re-signing. After setting an initial release date in that same month, casting took place between April and June. In October, Gray was announced to direct the film in the place of [[James Wan]], who had directed the previous installment. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2016 in locations such as M\u00fdvatn, Havana, Atlanta, Cleveland, and New York City, continuing the franchise's tradition of filming around the world. With an estimated production budget of up to $270 million, it is [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''The Fate of the Furious'' premiered in Berlin on April 4, 2017 and was theatrically released in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States on April 14 by [[Universal Pictures]]. Critics praised the performances and action sequences. However, the main criticism was the story, Theron's character, self-referential humor and runtime, and others deemed the film unnecessary in the wake of Walker's tribute in ''Furious 7''. The film was a box office success, grossing over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the nineteenth film (and the second in the franchise, after ''Furious 7'') to gross over $1&nbsp;billion, the [[2017 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2017]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|eleventh<!--LEAVE AT PEAK, NOT CURRENT--> highest-grossing film of all time]]. It also grossed $541.9&nbsp;million worldwide during its opening weekend, which made it the [[list of highest-grossing openings for films|highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time]] until the release of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018). The sequel, ''[[F9 (film)|F9]]'', was released internationally in May 2021 and released in the United States in June 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n[[Dominic Toretto|Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto]] and Letty Ortiz are on their honeymoon in [[Havana]] when Dom's cousin Fernando gets in trouble owing money to local racer Raldo. Sensing Raldo is a [[loan shark]], Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's 1949 [[Chevrolet Fleetline]] against Raldo's 1956 [[1955 Ford|Ford Fairlane Crown Victoria]], and wagering his own 1961 [[Chevrolet Impala#1961|Chevrolet Impala]]. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, saying his respect is enough and leaves his cousin with his own car. The next day, an elusive woman named Cipher coerces Dom into working for her by showing him something on her phone. Shortly afterward, [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs recruits Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, to help him retrieve an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP device]] from a military outpost in [[Berlin]]. During the getaway, Dom forces Hobbs off the road and steals the device for Cipher, who is a [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]].\n\nHobbs gets arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison which holds Deckard Shaw. After Hobbs and Shaw both escape the prison, intelligence operative Mr. Nobody and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Eric Reisner recruit them to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their own location, moments before the two attack the base, injure the team and steal God's Eye. When Dom shows frustration with Cipher, she shows him his ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves, and their son, of whose existence Dom was unaware, having kidnapped both to secure his loyalty. She sends Dom to retrieve a [[nuclear football]] held by the [[Ministry of Defense (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defense]] in New York City.\n\nWith the help of Raldo, Dom briefly evades Cipher, and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of many cars, remotely controlling them via [[Autopilot|auto drive]], causing them to blockade the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom in their cars, but Dom escapes and seemingly kills Deckard. Letty catches up to Dom and steals the football, but is nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom stops him and forces the football from Letty. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom, threatening his son next. Dom infiltrates a military separatist base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable security and a [[nuclear submarine]], enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its [[Nuclear weapon|arsenal]] to trigger a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. They are intercepted by the team, who shut down the submarine's nuclear weapons and drive toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving to sea, while being pursued by separatists.\n\nMeanwhile, Deckard, who faked his death with the help of Magdalene, teams up with Owen and infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an [[infrared homing]] missile at Dom's [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1968|Charger]], but he breaks away from his team and lures the missile to the trailing submarine. The team forms a vehicular blockade and shields Dom from the ensuing explosion as the submarine is destroyed. Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, who escapes by [[parachute]]. Mr. Nobody and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large. Hobbs has his record cleared and is offered his DSS job back, but he declines and chooses to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian and celebrates with his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|topic=the characters|List of Fast & Furious characters}}\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]], a former criminal, professional street racer and millionaire who has retired and settled down with his wife, Letty.<ref name=\"DieselRodriguezRussell\">{{cite web|last=Das|first=Chandan|title='Fast & Furious 8' Cast News, Release Date: Eva Mendes As Undercover Agent Monica Fuentes|url=http://www.breathecast.com/articles/fast-furious-8-cast-news-and-release-date-eva-mendes-to-return-as-undercover-agent-monica-29152/|work=BreatheCast|date=June 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704001231/http://www.breathecast.com/articles/fast-furious-8-cast-news-and-release-date-eva-mendes-to-return-as-undercover-agent-monica-29152/|archive-date=July 4, 2015|access-date=July 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Luke Hobbs]], a former [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent who allied with Dom and his team following their outings in Rio de Janeiro and Europe.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web|title=Fast & Furious 8: Dwayne Johnson confirms his return|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/story/fast-and-furious-8-dwayne-johnson-confirms-his-return/ar-BBjWpJw?ocid=MSNCOEO|publisher=[[MSN]]|date=May 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905040802/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/story/fast-and-furious-8-dwayne-johnson-confirms-his-return/ar-BBjWpJw?ocid=MSNCOEO|archive-date=September 5, 2015|access-date=June 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Statham]] as [[Deckard Shaw]], a rogue British soldier who was imprisoned by Hobbs and the DSS after his defeat in Los Angeles, who serves as an ally to help Dom's team take down Cipher.<ref name=\"Statham\">{{cite web|last=Brew|first=Simon|title=Exclusive: Jason Statham on Crank 3 and Fast & Furious 8|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/jason-statham/35542/exclusive-jason-statham-on-crank-3-and-fast-furious-8|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|date=May 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906022834/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/jason-statham/35542/exclusive-jason-statham-on-crank-3-and-fast-furious-8|archive-date=September 6, 2015|access-date=June 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as [[Letty Ortiz]], Dom's wife and a former professional street racer and the stepmother of Brian Marcos.<ref name=\"DieselRodriguezRussell\" />\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as [[Roman Pearce]], a former criminal from Barstow and a member of Dom's team.<ref name=\"GibsonLudacris\">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/fast-stars-sides-rumored-drama-rock-vin-diesel/story?id=41328372|title='Fast 8' Stars Take Sides in Rumored Drama Between the Rock and Vin Diesel -
