It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the ''[[Earthsea]]'' novels by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. The teleplay was written by [[Gavin Scott (screenwriter)|Gavin Scott]], and the series was directed by [[Robert Lieberman]]. It was an American-Canadian [[co-production (media)|co-production]], filmed on-location in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].\n\nCombining the plots of the [[A Wizard of Earthsea|first]] and [[The Tombs of Atuan|second]] novel, the story follows [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]] ([[Shawn Ashmore]]), a powerful but reckless mage-in-training, and [[Tenar]] ([[Kristin Kreuk]]), a young priestess, who are drawn together in a battle against the ancient race of demons known as the Nameless Ones. The cast also features [[Danny Glover]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] and [[Chris Gauthier]].\n\nThe series aired over two consecutive nights in December 2004, and received generally negative reviews from both critics and fans of the original novel, and was heavily criticized for its numerous deviations from the source material. However, it won seven [[Leo Awards]] and was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects]]. Le Guin stated in interviews that she had been cut out of the creative process, and subsequently disowned the series.<ref name=slate />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the land of [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]], a young wizard named [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged]] has visions about a girl and doors opening. Meanwhile, King Tygath wants to rule the land and release the Nameless Ones, demons from whom he hopes to learn the secret of immortality. He sends men to attack Ged's village, in search of the wizard of prophecy (Ged). Ged learns his first spell from an elderly woman. When the invasion comes, Ged uses a mist spell and lures the invaders over a cliff, saving the village. However, Ged also falls off the cliff.\n\nTygath tries to convince High Priestess Thar to release the Nameless Ones, but she refuses. She is poisoned by Rosa, her attendant who has been tricked by the king's lover, Kossil, every time she has tea.\n\nA [[Magi|magus]] named [[Aihal|Ogion]] arrives at Ged's village and revives Ged. He tells Ged his [[true name]] and takes him for training, but Ged is too impatient; he is sent to the magic school on Roke. There he meets the bully, Jasper, and befriends a student named Vetch. Ged shapeshifts into a hawk to show off. Jasper then challenges him to raise a spirit from the dead, leading him to accidentally release a Nameless One. The demon attacks Ged before being driven away by the Archmagus, who tells him that this Nameless One will hunt Ged down and try to possess him, using Ged's power for further destruction. Ged must go somewhere in hiding until he can find its true name and destroy it.\n\nWith the help of Jasper, King Tygath takes control of the magic school. He throws a knife at the Archmagus, apparently killing him and making Jasper the new Archmagus.\n\nWith the help of Ogion, Ged confronts the Gebbeth and attempts to drown him using a rock, however, it escapes with Ged's likeness and voice. Ged's impersonator becomes a murderer, and Vetch, a magus himself, chases Ged until he realizes Ged is not possessed by the Gebbeth and they decide to hunt it together.\n\nThey are attacked by the dragon, Orm Embar, but Ged uses the dragon's true name to bind him and ask three questions. He wastes his first question, but with his second, he learns the Gebbeth's location. The dragon tells him where to find the two pieces of the Amulet of Peace, which when reunited would save Earthsea, but Ged could have asked the true name of the demon.\n\nMeanwhile, Thar appoints a successor, Tenar, and tells her the incantation to release the Nameless Ones. Kossil strangles Rosa and frames Tenar, leading to her imprisonment.\n\nGed and Vetch return to Roke for help in decoding the dragon's riddle. The Archmagus survived Tygath's attack and made the real Jasper into a village fool as punishment. He sends Ged and Vetch to unseal the Nameless Tombs on Atuan, but Ged is captured and brought before Thar, who mistakes him for an evil wizard.\n\nIn the labyrinth, Ged is locked in the cell next to Tenar. They break free and recognize each other from their visions. Thar realizes her mistake right before her death. Kossil tries to force Tenar to reveal the incantation and fails, so Tygath kills Kossil and follows Tenar to the gate of the Nameless Ones.\n\nVetch finds the tomb first and is taken by the Gebbeth. Ged encounters Tygath in the labyrinth and fights him but then escapes into the tomb. He encounters the Gebbeth and realizes its true name is his own, because it is the darkness in himself. The demon is absorbed into Ged, making him whole again and strengthening him to strike Tygath in the tomb. Tygath threatens Tenar to release the Nameless Ones, but she refuses, remaining true to her faith.  Ged then requests Tenar to go ahead and release them.  He tells her to look into his eyes, in trust.  She recites the incantation, releasing the Nameless Ones.  The Nameless Ones, then, take Tygath into the sky before flying off. Ged reveals part of the key is the second half of the amulet. The Amulet of Peace is made whole, dispelling the Nameless Ones with a bright light and restoring peace to Earthsea. Ged is seen victorious with Tenar and they kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged / Sparrowhawk]], a young mage-in-training\n* [[Kristin Kreuk]] as [[Tenar]], a priestess of Atuan\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[Ogion]], a Master Mage and Ged\u2019s mentor\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as [[Thar (character)|Thar]], the high priestess of Atuan and Tenar's mentor\n* [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] as King [[Tygath]], the power-hungry ruler of the Kargides.
