The screenplay by [[Richard LaGravenese]] is based on the [[memoir]] of the same name by [[journalist]] [[Franz Lidz]].\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nWhen young Steven's mother Selma is diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] and becomes increasingly ill, his eccentric and emotionally distant inventor father Sid&nbsp;\u2014 despite deep reservations&nbsp;\u2014 allows him to live with his [[:wikt:dysfunction|dysfunction]]al [[uncle]]s, [[Compulsive hoarding|pack rat]] Arthur and [[delusion]]al [[Paranoia|paranoid]] Danny, in their cluttered apartment in the rundown King Edward Hotel. The two, who live in a setting worthy of the [[Collyer brothers]], rechristen the boy with the more colorful name Franz and help him cope with his emotions by teaching him to value his own uniqueness. Learning from the odd pair that even though hope and science may fail, but art always survives, Franz secretly begins to create a memorial to his mother before she dies, filling a box with personal mementos&nbsp;\u2014 a tube of lipstick, an empty [[Chanel]] bottle, a cigarette lighter, and the like.\n\n==Production notes==\nThe film shifted the original story's setting of [[New York City]] to [[Southern California]], and the four uncles from the memoir were condensed into two.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=6-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=unstrung+heroes+hebrew&source=bl&ots=WpZ-YXJ4Rs&sig=6IHxhuVT5w_qiMXUhGeG4JwsrwM&hl=en&ei=3dB6S6z9LdGk8AaekqieCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=&f=false Google Books]</ref>\n\nKeaton's previous directing credits were the 1987 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Heaven (1987 film)|Heaven]]'' and the 1991 [[television movie]] ''Wildflower''.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]] in May.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3394/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Unstrung Heroes |access-date=2009-09-07|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> Prior to its release, it was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and the [[Boston Film Festival]], both held in September 1995.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94520&category=Misc%20Notes ''Unstrung Heroes'' at Turner Classic Movies]</ref>\n\nDuring its widest release in the US, the film played at only 576 theaters.

I never imagined that my life could be turned into [[Old Yeller]].\"<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Later, in an essay for the [[New York Times]], he cracked that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of Old Movie Disease: \"The way Disney killed off my mother -- after fixing pancakes, she praises her kids, plants a perversely passionate kiss on her husband's lips and, to soulful strains of ''[[You Are My Sunshine]]'', drifts off to die in a comfy armchair -- reminded me of [[Mad magazine]]'s send-up of ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''.\" He added, \"Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/movies/film-in-a-higher-state-of-being-that-is-dying.html?pagewanted=1 The New York Times]</ref>\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"A coming-of-age piece that is slight to the point of anemia, \"Unstrung Heroes\" sports a willful eccentricity that almost immediately becomes annoying. Diane Keaton's debut dramatic feature aims for a distinctively offbeat tone that never really gels and the movie's emotional power, stemming from personal growth through family tragedy, falls short of the goal as well.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904086.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 Variety]</ref>\n\nIn her review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] called ''Unstrung Heroes'' \"a warm, surprising, gently incandescent film . . . [that] becomes a celebration of quirky independence and the sustaining powers of art and memory . . . [it] also succeeds in becoming very moving without being maudlin . . . [the] screenplay runs the risk of being generically uplifting, even bland; instead, it has a sharply distinctive flavor, honest pathos and a hint of delightful household magic. Thomas Newman's sparkling musical score echoes that buoyant tone.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CEFDF1331F936A2575AC0A963958260 ''The New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that the film \"has been directed by Diane Keaton with an unusual combination of sentiment and quirky eccentricity.

[it] is that rare mainstream film that doesn't shout in our ear to make its points. It draws us in, subtly and gracefully, and casts a lingering charm.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/09/15/DD57930.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the film as \"a sensitive coming-of-age story in the sublime tradition of ''[[My Life as a Dog]]''.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/unstrungheroespgkempley_c02eb5.htm ''Washington Post'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] opined, \"Steven Lidz, a 12-year-old growing up in New York during the '60s with a dying mother and a distracted father, turns to his loony but life-affirming uncles. Sugar shock? Wait. Jump ahead to 1991. Steven, now Franz Lidz and a writer for Sports Illustrated, wins acclaim for a childhood memoir that doesn't choke on whimsy or schmaltz. Wait again. The film version, directed by Diane Keaton from a script by Richard LaGravenese (The Bridges of Madison County), isn't above a little tear-jerking. There's also the matters of reducing Steven's four unstrung uncles to two, Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin); casting Andie MacDowell as Selma, Steven's Jewish mother; and shooting this [[Lower East Side]] story in Pasadena, Calif.
