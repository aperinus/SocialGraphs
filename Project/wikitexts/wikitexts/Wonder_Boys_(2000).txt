An [[international co-production]] between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, it is based on the 1995 [[Wonder Boys|novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Chabon]]. [[Michael Douglas]] stars as professor Grady Tripp, a novelist who teaches [[creative writing]] at a university but has been unable to finish his second novel.\n\nThe film was shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including locations at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Chatham University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Shady Side Academy]]. Other Pennsylvania locations included [[Beaver, Pennsylvania|Beaver]], [[Rochester, Pennsylvania|Rochester]] and [[Rostraver Township, Pennsylvania|Rostraver Township]]. After the film failed at the box office, there was a second attempt to find an audience with a new marketing campaign and a November 8, 2000, re-release, which was also a financial disappointment. Despite this, the film received three [[Academy Award]] nominations at the [[73rd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Things Have Changed]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Grady Tripp is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pennsylvania university. He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell, whose husband, Walter, is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over 2500 pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking cannabis.\n\nGrady's students include James Leer and Hannah Green. Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on.\n\nDuring a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of [[Marilyn Monroe]] memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.\n\nMeanwhile, Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree, has flown into town on the pretense of attending the university's annual WordFest, a literary event for aspiring authors. In reality, Terry is there to see if Grady has written anything worth publishing, as both men's careers depend on Grady's upcoming book. Terry arrives with a date whom he met on the flight, a transvestite called Antonia Sloviak. The pair become intimate in a bedroom at the Gaskells' party, but immediately afterward, Terry meets James and becomes infatuated with him, and Antonia is unceremoniously sent home. After a night on the town, Terry and James semi-consciously flirt throughout the night, which eventually leads up to the two spending an intimate night together in one of Grady's spare rooms.\n\nTired and confused, Grady phones Walter and reveals to him that he is in love with Sara. Meanwhile, Walter has also made the connection between the disappearance of the Marilyn Monroe memorabilia and James. The following morning the police arrive with Sara to escort James to the Chancellor's office to discuss the ramifications of his actions. The memorabilia is still in Grady's car, which has conspicuously gone missing. The car had been given to him by a friend as payment for a loan, and, over the weekend, Grady has come to suspect that the car was stolen. Throughout his travel around town, a man claiming to be the car's real owner repeatedly accosted Grady. He eventually tracks the car down, but in a dispute over its ownership, the majority of his manuscript blows out of the car and is lost. The car's owner gives him a ride to the university with his wife Oola in the passenger seat, along with the stolen memorabilia.\n\nGrady finally sees that making things right involves having to make difficult choices. Grady tells the story behind the memorabilia and allows Oola to leave with it. Worried that Grady's choice comes at the expense of damaging James's future, Terry convinces Walter not to press charges by agreeing to publish his book about [[Joe DiMaggio]] and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nGrady recounts the fate of the main characters: Hannah graduates and becomes a junior editor, James drops out and moves to New York to rework his novel for publication, and Terry \"goes right on being Crabtree.\" Grady finishes typing his new book{{snd}}now saved on a computer{{snd}}which is an account of the recent events, then watches as Sara and their child arrive home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Professor Grady Tripp\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as James Leer\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Chancellor Sara Gaskell\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Hannah Green\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Quentin \"Q\" Morewood\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Terry Crabtree\n* [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] as Walter Gaskell\n* Richard Knox as Vernon Hardapple\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Oola\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Sam Traxler\n* [[George Grizzard]] as Fred Leer\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Amanda Leer\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Emily's father\n* [[Michael Cavadias]] as Miss Antonia \"Tony\" Sloviak\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', [[Curtis Hanson]] was working on a screenplay of his own and reading other scripts with a keen interest for his next film.<ref name=\"Strauss\">{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Bob | title = From B-Movies to Hollywood's A-List | work =[[The Globe and Mail]] | date = February 25, 2000 }}</ref> Actress [[Elizabeth McGovern]] advised Hanson to work with screenwriter [[Steve Kloves]].

Additional changes were made once Hanson came on board. For example, he felt that James Leer would be a fan of [[Douglas Sirk]]'s films as opposed to [[Frank Capra]] as he is in the novel.<ref name=\"Sragow\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nParamount was not interested in making a quirky, character-driven comedy drama until Douglas agreed to work well below his usual large fee.<ref name=\"Strauss\"/> The actor gained 25 pounds for the film by consuming pizza, subs, and beer.<ref name=\"Rickey\">{{cite news | last = Rickey | first = Carrie | title = Wonder Years for Reborn Michael | work = [[Sunday Telegraph]] | date = June 18, 2000 }}</ref> One of the challenges for Hanson was to take a plot that, as he put it, \"is meandering and, apparently, sort of aimless,\" and a character that \"does things that even he doesn't really know why he's doing them,\" and try to create a \"feeling of focus\" to keep the audience interested.<ref name=\"Strauss\"/> Another challenge the director faced was working in actual locations in very cold weather that was constantly changing.<ref name=\"Strauss\"/>\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was on probation during the winter of 1999 when Hanson considered him for a role in ''Wonder Boys''.<ref name=\"Portman\">{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = Robert Downey Jr.'s Unfortunate Incarceration | work = [[Ottawa Citizen]] | date = February 24, 2000 }}</ref> Hanson was cautious because of the actor's drug history and concerned because it would be a tough film shot in sequence in Pittsburgh in the winter. Downey flew to Pittsburgh and had a long dinner conversation with Hanson where they addressed his problems. The actor demonstrated a commitment to the project and Hanson hired him. Reportedly, Downey acted professionally for the entire four-and-a-half month shoot, but after it ended, he returned to [[Los Angeles]] and violated his parole.<ref name=\"Portman\"/>\n\nIn an interview with [[Marc Maron]], actor [[Rob McElhenney]] stated that he was initially cast in a minor role as Holmes' love interest, but was informed by Hanson that he would be cut out of the film during post-production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWHfiyzhHc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213131602/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeWHfiyzhHc |archive-date=2017-02-13 |url-status=dead|title=WTF Podcast - ROB MCELHENNEY|last=WTF Podcast Marc Maron|date=July 9, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nParamount suggested shooting ''Wonder Boys'' in Toronto or New York City but after reading the book, Hanson realized how important Pittsburgh was to the story, that it was a \"wonder boy,\" much like the film's main protagonist Grady Tripp, \"it's a city that had this glorious past of wealth and success that ended.

Spinotti had six weeks of pre-production, which he used to perform a variety of tests and shoot a number of important background plates for several scenes that take place at night, in cars. He knew that these scenes included some very critical acting and suggested using the green screen process for greater control.<ref name=\"Heuring\"/> During pre-production, Hanson and Spinotti used the Kodak Pre View System to storyboard complicated sequences by altering digital still images in a way that simulated the imaging characteristics of camera films. Hanson suggested Spinotti see ''[[The Celebration]]'' for its technique of keeping the camera extremely close to the actors and carrying deep focus from one actor to the other. Spinotti suggested using a hand-held camera so that the film would not look static. On the first day of shooting, they incorporated some hand-held shots. Hanson liked the results and they used the technique extensively for the rest of the shoot.<ref name=\"Heuring\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Wonder Boys (Music from the Motion Picture)\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| border     = yes\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 15, 2000\n| recorded   = 2000\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 51:46\n| label      = [[Sony]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Wonder Boys (Music from the Motion Picture)\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Things Have Changed]]\n | single1date = May 1, 2000\n}}\n}}\nHanson had been a fan of [[Bob Dylan]]'s music since childhood and a great admirer of his soundtrack for ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]''.<ref name=\"Sragow\"/> Dylan admired Hanson's previous film, ''L.A.

Hanson also created a music video for the song, filming new footage of Bob Dylan on the film's various locations and editing it with footage used in ''Wonder Boys'' as if Dylan were actually in the film.
