It is the fourth installment of the ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' series. Chan reprises his role as \"Kevin\" Chan Ka-Kui (named \"Jackie\" in international releases), a [[Hong Kong police]] officer who works for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to track down and arrest an illegal weapons dealer. Jackie realizes that things are not as simple as they appear and soon finds himself a pawn of an organization posing as Russian intelligence.<ref>{{cite news |title= First Strike,' Jackie Chan's Out |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-01-10/news/9701080339_1_jackie-chan-first-strike-film |access-date=2010-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot partially in Hong Kong, [[Crimea]] ([[Ukraine]]), [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]) and [[Brisbane]] in [[Queensland]] ([[Australia]]). [[Chinatown, Brisbane]] in [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and Underwater World on the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] were also used. Filming took place from August to November 1995. The film was released in Hong Kong on 10 February 1996. The original Hong Kong version was filmed in four languages: [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], English, [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]. To advertise ''First Strike'', Jackie recorded the song '''\u600e\u9ebc\u6703 Zenme Hui''' and also made a music video for it. As is typical with Chan's pictures, the US version does not feature the theme song. The North American version also dubbed all the non-English dialogue in Cantonese, Russian and Ukrainian into English.\n\n==Plot==\nWhilst working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Jackie is assigned to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case. One of the tasks the CIA gives him is simple enough: watch a woman named Natasha while on a plane from Hong Kong to Crimea (Ukraine) and record her movements. Jackie arrives in Ukraine and the CIA, partnered with local [[Security Service of Ukraine|Security Service]], take over the task of following Natasha. However, the CIA operation almost falls apart when the Ukrainian Strike Force arrest Natasha. Luckily for the CIA, Jackie spots Natasha being driven away and he discreetly follows her. During the chase in [[Yalta]], Jackie discovers that Natasha is working with an unknown male partner, who actually called in the Strike Force to prevent Natasha from being followed. Natasha and the unknown male are also romantically involved. Jackie decides to follow the unknown male to a remote lodge in the [[Crimean mountains]], and informs the CIA of his location.\n\nThe unknown male is apparently meeting with Russian mafia members who are interested in a nuclear bomb that's in his possession. The criminals are on high alert when they spot Jackie and agents of [[Militsiya (Ukraine)|Ukrainian militsiya]] and the CIA arriving. A gunfight ensues. During the battle, the unknown male is identified as Jackson Tsui, a [[Chinese-American]] [[nuclear scientist]] with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Jackie finds a briefcase which contained evidence from Tsui, but as he is chased by mafia forces, Jackie loses the briefcase as he falls into frozen waters, and the mafia takes the briefcase. When he recovers in Russian military hospital, he meets Colonel Gregor Yegorov of the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], who explains the situation. Jackie goes with him to Moscow where he discovers he has been assigned to work with Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. He is smuggled into [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] by a Russian submarine.\n\nIn order to find out where Jackson is, Jackie befriends his younger sister Annie, who works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Jackie pretends to be Jackson's \"sworn brother\". Chan's deception is successful, and he eventually meets Uncle 7, the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss. Uncle 7 is seriously ill and will be getting surgery soon. While meeting Uncle 7, Jackie reveals the true nature of his visit to both Uncle 7 and Annie and informs them of Jackson's criminal activities. Jackie then meets with Gregor to report his findings. He tells Gregor that if Uncle 7 dies, Jackson will surely show up. Unknown to Jackie, Jackson is hiding at the hospital and has given a nuclear warhead (disguised as a small oxygen tank) to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. While following Annie, Jackie gets held up by Jackson, who claims to have a deal with Gregor. He also reveals to Jackie that Gregor has secretly put audio bugs in several of the objects the FSB gave him.\n\nAfter realizing he has been used by Gregor for nefarious purposes, Jackie decides to return home and write a full report to both of their superiors. Two men are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7. He attempts to clear his name by going to see Annie at the memorial hall, but he is (unsurprisingly) unwelcome, having to fight younger brother Allen Tsui and the family's bodyguards until Jackson arrives to clear Jackie's name. Jackson explains that Gregor caught him on a CIA assignment three years before, and forced him to turn into a triple agent: a CIA agent ostensibly turned by the FSB, but in reality serving Gregor's private criminal schemes. Gregor uses the nuclear warheads to secure stakes in oil franchises in the [[Middle East]]. Jackson was trying to get money from Gregor for the warhead. Annie, Jackie, and Jackson decide to work together to find Gregor and bring him in.\n\nUncle 7's elaborate Chinatown funeral becomes the scene for a complex shootout between the various parties, injuring Jackson as he's caught in an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] explosion. Annie and Jackie attempt to retrieve the stolen warhead from the shark pool (so that they can return it to the police), but Gregor and his men follow them, leading to a climactic confrontation underwater. During the fight, Gregor shoots the aquarium tank and shatters the glass, which releases a [[great white shark]] into the restaurant area. During the confusion, Gregor escapes with the warhead and kidnaps Annie to a getaway boat. Jackie saves the tourists from the shark and then pursues Gregor. While Gregor escapes in the getaway boat, Jackie finds and drives a [[Mitsubishi FTO]] display car onto the boat. The car pins Gregor, allowing Jackie to successfully retrieve the warhead and save Annie as armed police close in. Gregor and Jackson are apprehended by the Australian police and turned over to Russian authorities. The case is solved, and Jackie is thanked for his work by the FSB and returns to his work in Hong Kong.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Jackie / \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-kui]]\n* [[:zh:\u6a13\u5b78\u8ce2|Jackson Lou]] as Jackson Tsui\n* [[Annie Wu (actress)|Annie Wu]] as Annie Tsui\n* [[Bill Tung]] as \"Uncle\" Bill Wong\n* Yuriy Petrov as Col.

Mike LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film an enthusiastic review:\n\n{{cquote|One of the pleasures of being alive at this period of history is Jackie Chan. There are other pleasures, of course, and other movie pleasures, too. But few things in film today are as reliable as a Jackie Chan movie. Even if the picture is weak, Chan is never disappointing. Watching him in ''Jackie Chan's First Strike'', a brand-new effort opening today, there's no doubt that this is a lovable original and a great popular artist. So this time Chan swims with sharks. He climbs from balcony to balcony on the top floor of a tall hotel building. He even -- get this -- drops 100 feet from a helicopter into a frozen lake, just as the helicopter explodes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chan Keeps It Thrilling |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=10 January 1997 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/01/10/DD61481.DTL |access-date=2010-11-02 |first=Mick |last=Lasalle}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the film in January 1997 and rated it three out of four stars in ''[[Lancaster New Era]]'' newspaper. He noted that \"Chan is said to be the world's top action star\" outside of the United States, and that what \"makes him popular is not just his stunts (he is famous for doing them all himself) but his attitude\" and reactions to them. He said \"Jackie Chan is an acquired taste\" and the film lacks \"the polish of big-budget Hollywood extravaganzas\" while the dubbed dialogue \"sounds like cartoon captions,\" but that \"Chan himself is a graceful and skilled physical actor, immensely likable, and there's a kind of Boy Scout innocence in the action that's refreshing after all the doom-mongering, blood-soaked Hollywood action movies.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |author1-link=Roger Ebert |title=Jackie Chan 'strikes' again |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/565498299/ |access-date=18 April 2022 |work=[[Lancaster New Era]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=9 January 1997 |page=52 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n''[[Arlington Heights Daily Herald]]'' newspaper rated it two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it a \"homage to [[James Bond]], spiced up with elaborate fight pieces choreographed to show off Chan's incredible comic battle style.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Movie Guide |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/arlington-heights-daily-herald-suburban-chicago-jan-25-1997-p-150/ |access-date=19 April 2022 |work=[[Arlington Heights Daily Herald]] |via=[[NewspaperArchive.com]] |date=25 January 1997 |page=7 (Section 5) |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nIt currently has a 57% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with a 6.1/10 average rating from 23 reviewers and 6.8/10 rating from 7 top critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jackie_chans_first_strike/ |title=Jackie Chan's First Strike |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* [[16th Hong Kong Film Awards|1997]] [[Hong Kong Film Award]]s\n** Won: Best Action Choreography ([[Stanley Tong]])\n** Nominated: Best Picture\n** Nominated: Best Actor ([[Jackie Chan]])\n** Nominated: Best New Performer ([[Annie Wu (actress)|Annie Wu]])\n** Nominated: Best Film Editing (Peter Cheung, Yau Chi-wai)\n* 1996 [[Golden Horse Film Festival]]\n** Won: Best Action Direction ([[Stanley Tong]])\n* 1997 [[MTV Movie Awards]]\n** Nominated: Best Fight\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0116704}}\n* {{Amg movie|135917}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=307760}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|jackie_chans_first_strike}}\n\n{{Police Story|state=expanded}}\n{{Stanley Tong}}\n{{Best Action Choreography HKFA}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1996 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s police procedural films]]\n[[Category:1990s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanley Tong]]\n[[Category:Films scored by J.
