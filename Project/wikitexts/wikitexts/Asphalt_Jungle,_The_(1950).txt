[[Marilyn Monroe]] also appears, in one of her earliest roles.\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]].

Doc needs $50,000 to hire three men\u2014a [[Safe-cracking|safecracker]], a driver, and a [[hooligan]]\u2014to pull off a huge jewel robbery.  Cobby arranges a meeting between Doc and Alonzo Emmerich, a high-living society lawyer and known [[fixer (person)|fixer]]. Doc tells Emmerich he estimates the theft will yield a cache worth half a million dollars or more. Emmerich agrees to front the money and find a [[fence (criminal)|fence]].\n\nDoc secures Louie Ciavelli as his \"box man\". Ciavelli only trusts Gus Minissi, a [[kyphosis|hunchbacked]] diner owner, to be the [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]]. Last hired is chronically gambling-strapped tough Dix Handley, a hulking Kentucky hayseed known to Gus. Dix tells Doll Conovan\u2014who is in love with him\u2014of his dream to buy back the horse farm that his family lost after a terrible year that included his father's death and a prized colt breaking its leg.\n\nTo access the jewelry store, Ciavelli hammers through a brick wall, deactivates an alarm to admit Doc and Dix, and uses home-brewed [[nitroglycerine]] to blow open the safe. Things then begin to go drastically wrong. The concussion of the explosion triggers several burglar alarms in the area. The volatile Dix slugs a security guard on rounds. The guard drops his revolver, which goes off and wounds Ciavelli in the belly. The men get away unseen, but a police manhunt begins.\n\nCiavelli insists that Gus take him home. Gus's wife wants him taken to the hospital, where his critical gunshot wound will be recognized and reported.  Instead, Gus sends for a trusted but illicit doctor. \n\nAt Emmerich's office the cad confesses he is broke to his private detective Bob Brannon.  Sent to collect debts owed Emmerich to raise money to pay for the stolen jewels Brannom comes up empty.  Desperate, Emmerich inveigles the thug to help him double-cross the others, proposing a scheme for him to abscond with the gems. Doc and Dix arrive, but see through Emmerich's stall.  Realizing this, Brannom draws a gun, but is killed by Dix, who receives a flesh wound in his side.  Doc scolds a morose Emmerich for his foolish plan and tells him to offer the loot to the jeweler's insurance company for 25% of its value.\n\nEmmerich dumps Brannom's body in the river. The police find the list of debtors on Emmerich's letterhead on the corpse. When they question him, Emmerich lies about his whereabouts and claims he spent the night with his mistress, Angela Phinlay.\n\nUnder pressure from police commissioner Hardy, police lieutenant Ditrich\u2014a corrupt cop on Cobby's payroll\u2014beats the bookie into confessing everything in a vain attempt to save himself from becoming ensnared.\n\nHardy then arrests Emmerich at Angela's home and threatens her with jail for providing Emmerich with an alibi. When the police allow Emmerich to leave the room to phone his invalid wife, he shoots himself dead.\n\nAfter Gus is arrested, he attacks Cobby in the jail, warning him that he will end up in the morgue. When the police knock on Ciavelli's door, they find his funeral in progress.\n\nIn Doll's apartment, Doc offers Dix some of the stones but he refuses; he just wants to go back home to Kentucky. Doll then gets Dix a car and insists on going along.\n\nDoc persuades a taxi driver to drive him to [[Cleveland]], a multi-hour ride. They stop first at a roadside diner, where Doc becomes entranced by a pretty young woman dancing to [[jukebox]] tunes. Because of the delay, a lustfully oblivious Doc is recognized by two policemen, who arrest him after finding the stolen jewels hidden in his overcoat.\n\nSuffering from blood loss Dix passes out at the wheel. He's taken to a doctor, who phones the local police to report a gunshot wound. Dix regains consciousness, pulls out an IV and escapes. \n\nAt a press conference, Hardy notes that 3 of the 7 suspects have died, 3 others have been arrested, and the one on the loose is a hardened killer \"without human feeling.\"\n\nBack at the wheel, the rolling green fields of [[Bluegrass region|Bluegrass country]] pass as Dix deliriously rambles about the sprightly colt he loved as a boy. Arriving at his childhood pasture he stumbles in and collapses. Doll runs for help, while horses gather to nuzzle the expiring man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=75%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Dix Handley\n* [[Louis Calhern]] as Alonzo D.

R. Burnett]]. It was backed by the major film studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where it was green-lighted by production chief [[Dore Schary]], over the objections of studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]].  From the publication of Burnett's first novel, ''Little Caesar'' in 1929, Burnett had a strong track record of books that were adapted into films shortly after publication.  Huston and Ben Maddow wrote the adaptation, which emphasized the crooks' story and reduced the [[police procedural]] aspect.<ref name=intro>[[Eddie Muller|Muller Eddie]] (June 2, 2019) Intro to the [[Turner Classic Movies]] ''Noir Alley'' presentation of the film</ref> Burnett was consulted as the shooting script was being written, and he approved the final version.<ref name=afi /> The studio allowed the production a relatively free hand.\n\nProduction on ''The Asphalt Jungle'' took place from October 21, 1949, to late December of that year. Location shooting took place in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Keeneland]], [[Kentucky]] and in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|26211}}</ref>\n\nIn shooting the film, Huston was influenced by European [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] films such as ''[[Rome, Open City|Open City]]'' (1945) and ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948). He combined the naturalism of that genre with the stylized look of ''[[film noir]]'' and Hollywood crime films.<ref name=intro />  When the film was complete, Louis B. Mayer said: \"It's trash. That Asphalt Pavement thing is full of nasty, ugly people doing nasty things. I wouldn't cross the street to see a picture like that.\"<ref name=intro /><ref name=afi />\n\nThe [[Production Code Administration]]'s main concerns with the script were the detailed depiction of the heist and the fact that the character of the corrupt lawyer Emmerich seemed to cheat justice by killing himself.<ref name=naremore/> Neither the studio nor the censors interfered significantly with the script, however, and both the heist and the suicide featured in the final cut.<ref name=naremore/>  The latter scene was re-written: the original had Emmerich finishing a suicide note, while the revision has him stall after writing an endearing salutation to his wife, crumple the note, and become visibly extremely agitated about the decision to kill himself before an abrupt cutaway to an offscreen shot being heard.<ref name=afi />\n\nHuston's first choice for the role played by Marilyn Monroe was [[Lola Albright]], who was not available.<ref name=afi /> Huston brought in Monroe for a [[screen test]], and rehearsed for it with her in his office.  He wasn't convinced that she was right for the part, and dismissed her, but changed his mind when he watched her leave the room.  According to ''film noir'' authority [[Eddie Muller]], Huston later said that Monroe was \"one of the few actresses who could make an entrance by leaving the room.\"  The role was a breakout for her.<ref name=intro />\n\nBoth Huston and star Sterling Hayden, a World War II hero who had fought alongside [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and had joined the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] upon returning to the U.S., were members of the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], which opposed the blacklisting of alleged communists active in the film industry during the [[Red Scare]].<ref name=naremore/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to MGM records the film made $1,077,000 in the US and Canada and $1,060,000 overseas resulting in a profit of only $40,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/><ref name=\"scott\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nA contemporary review in ''[[Photoplay]]'' stated:\n{{blockquote|This brutally frank story of crime and punishment in a Midwestern city was directed by two-time [[Academy Award]] winner, John Huston\u2014son of the late [[Walter Huston]]. John's pictures are usually grim (''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''), but always dramatic and exciting. This time he exposes the behind-the-scenes details of the robbery of a jewelry store... This picture is packed with stand-out performances... There's a beautiful blonde, too, name of Marilyn Monroe, who plays Calhern's girl friend, and makes the most of her footage.{{cn|date=October 2022}}}}\n\nAt the time of its release ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of the film:\n{{blockquote|Louis Calhern as the big lawyer who tries to pull a double cross and muffs it is exceptionally fluid and adroit and Sterling Hayden is sure-fire as a brazen hoodlum who just wants to go back home. Likewise Sam Jaffe does wonders as a cool-headed mastermind, James Whitmore is taut as a small 'fixer' and John McIntire is crisp as a chief of police. But, then, everyone in the picture\u2014which was produced incidentally, by M.G.M.\u2014gives an unimpeachable performance. If only it all weren't so corrupt.<ref name=meyer/>}}\n\nIn 1988 the [[Criterion Collection]] critic Peter Heath Becker admired Huston's technique:\n\n{{blockquote|Through his experience as a painter, [Huston] learned to frame an image, and throughout the film, he uses one shot where other directors might have needed three. He dispenses with editing flourishes and over-dramatic lighting and opts instead for sustained, well-composed shots. By balancing elements in the foreground and background of his images, Huston frames events and responses at once, without cutting between them.<ref>[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/827-the-asphalt-jungle The Asphalt Jungle] Criterion Collection (February 1, 1988) accessed Sept. 13, 2016</ref>}}\n\nOn today's [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 35 reviews,{{when|date=October 2022}} with an average rating of 8.4/10.

The series, though, resembled the film in name only, except for one episode, \"The Professor\", which was constructed as a sequel to the feature. Beyond this, none of the characters in the film appeared in the television scripts, and the plots were devoted to the exploits of the major case squad of the [[New York Police Department]]. One of the most notable features of the series is the theme song, written by [[Duke Ellington]].<ref name=ctva/>\n\nBurnett's novel ''The Asphalt Jungle'' was the basis of M-G-M's western film ''[[The Badlanders]]'' (1958) directed by [[Delmer Daves]], as well as ''[[Cairo (1963 film)|Cairo]]'' starring [[George Sanders]], followed by the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Cool Breeze (film)|Cool Breeze]]'' (1972), directed by Barry Pollack.<ref name=afi />\n\n''The Asphalt Jungle'' further developed the crime thriller subgenre of [[caper film]]s.<ref name=naremore/> The 1955 French film ''[[Rififi]]'', which critics such as [[Leonard Maltin]] have labeled as the best heist film ever, drew much inspiration from ''The Asphalt Jungle''.<ref name=nnat/>\n\nIn 2008, ''The Asphalt Jungle'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Colorization dispute==\nThe movie was the subject of a [[film colorization]] lawsuit and controversy in France. [[Turner Entertainment]] entered into an agreement with the French television channel, [[La Cinq]], to broadcast the colorized movie. John Huston's heirs objected, filing a lawsuit against broadcasting this version. On November 23, 1988, ''The Asphalt Jungle'' was prohibited from being broadcast in France. On July 6, 1989, La Cinq won on appeal, broadcasting the film on August 6, 1989. Finally in ''Turner Entertainment Co. v. Huston,'' on May 28, 1991, the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] cancelled the judgment delivered on July 6, 1989, stating that colorizing the movie transformed the original artwork enough to potentially transgress the author's moral rights.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.taradji.com/color.html |title=Colorization and 'Moral Rights' of the Artist |first=Nima |last=Taradji |work=taradji.com |year=1998 |access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peteryu.com/intip_msu/turner.pdf|title=Turner Entertainment Co. v.
