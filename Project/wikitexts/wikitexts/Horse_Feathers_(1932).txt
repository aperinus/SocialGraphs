Baravelli is an \"iceman\", who delivers ice and bootleg liquor from a local [[speakeasy]]. Pinky is also an \"iceman\", and a part-time dogcatcher. Through a series of misunderstandings, Baravelli and Pinky are accidentally recruited to play for Huxley instead of the actual professional players.\n[[File:The 4 Marx Brothers in \"Horse Feathers\" - The Film Daily, Jul-Dec 1932 (page 269 crop).jpg|thumb|367x367px|Ad in ''[[The Film Daily]]'', 1932]]\nThe climax of the film, which ESPN listed as first in its \"top 11 scenes in football movie history,\"<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=williams/080404_scenes ''The top 11 scenes in football movie history''] at ESPN.com.</ref> includes the four protagonists winning the football game by successfully performing a version of the [[hidden ball trick]] and then scoring the winning touchdown in a horse-drawn garbage wagon that Pinky rides like a [[chariot]].

(This song was later the title song of a [[Everyone Says I Love You|1996 Woody Allen movie]]). All four brothers perform the song, almost every time as a serenade to Connie Bailey. Zeppo leads  with a \"straight\" verse:\n\n{{poemquote|\nEveryone says I love you\nThe cop on the corner and the burglar too\nThe preacher in the pulpit and the man in the pew\nSays I love you.\n}}\n\nHarpo whistles it once to his horse, and later plays it on the harp to serenade Miss Bailey. Chico sings a comic verse, with his standard fake Italian accent, while playing piano:\n\n{{poemquote|\nEveryone says I love you\nThe great big mosquito when-a he sting you\nThe fly when he gets stuck on the flypaper too\nSays I love you.\n}}\n\nGroucho sings a sarcastic verse, sitting in a canoe strumming a guitar as Miss Bailey paddles. This is in line with his suspicions about the college widow's intentions throughout the film.\n\n{{poemquote|\nEveryone says I love you\nBut just what they say it for I never knew\nIt's just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who\nSays I love you.\n}}\n\n==Notable scenes==\nIn the opening number Wagstaff and a group of college professors sing and dance in full academic robes and [[mortarboard]] hats:\n\n{{poemquote|\nI don't know what they have to say\nIt makes no difference anyway;\nWhatever it is, I'm against it!\n}}\n\nA later scene features Baravelli guarding the speakeasy and Wagstaff trying to get in. The password for entry is \"Swordfish\". This sequence degenerates into a series of puns:\n\n{{poemquote|\n'''Wagstaff''': I got it! [[Haddock]].\n'''Baravelli''': 'At's a-funny, I got a [[Headache|haddock]] too.\n'''Wagstaff''': What do you take for a haddock?\n'''Baravelli''': Well, Sometimes I take an [[aspirin]], sometimes I take a [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel]].\n'''Wagstaff''': Say, I'd walk a mile for a [[Camel (cigarette)|calomel]].\n'''Baravelli''': You mean chocolate [[Caramel|calomel]]? I like-a that too, but you no guess it.\n}}\n\nAt the door, Pinky is also asked the password. He responds by pulling a fish from his coat and sticking a small sword down its throat.\n\nLater Wagstaff and Baravelli debate the cost of ice. Wagstaff argues that his bill should be much smaller than it is:\n\n{{poemquote|\n'''Baravelli''': I make you proposition. You ''owe'' us $200, we take 2000 and we call it square.\n'''Wagstaff''': That's not a bad idea. I tell you what ... I'll consult my lawyer. And if he advises me to do it, I'll get a new lawyer.\n}}\n\nAnd on another subject: \n \n{{poemquote|\n'''Baravelli''': Last week, for eighteen dollars, I gotta co-ed with two pair of pants.\n'''Wagstaff''': Since when has a co-ed got two pair of pants?\n'''Baravelli''': Since I joined the college.\n}}\n\nA notable scene taken from the earlier revue ''Fun in Hi Skule'' consists of the brothers disrupting an [[anatomy]] class.<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> The professor asks for a student to explain the symptoms of [[cirrhosis]]. Baravelli obliges:\n\n{{poemquote|\nSo roses are red\nSo violets are blue\nSo sugar is sweet\nSo so are you.\n}}\n\nThe professor protests that his facts are in order: Baravelli and Pinky bear him out. Wagstaff takes over the class and continues the lecture.\n\n{{poemquote|\n'''Wagstaff''': Let us follow a corpuscle on its journey ... Now then, baboons, what is a [[Blood cell|corpuscle]]?\n'''Baravelli''': That's easy! First is a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] ... then a [[lieutenant]] ... then is a [[corporal|corpuscle]]!\n'''Wagstaff''': That's fine. Why don't you bore a hole in yourself and let the sap run out?\n}}\n\nA little later, Wagstaff advises Pinky that he can't burn the candle at both ends. Pinky then reaches into his [[trenchcoat]], and produces a candle burning at both ends.\n\nForeshadowing the \"stateroom\" scene from the 1935 film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', all four Marx brothers and the main antagonist take turns going in and out of Connie Bailey's room, and eventually their movements pile up on each other, resulting in a crowded, bustling scene, notable both by Groucho's breaking of the [[fourth wall]] during Chico's piano solo, and his constant opening of his umbrella and removing his overshoes upon entering the room. The overshoes were commonly known as 'rubbers', a reference to contraceptives, a visual gag about Groucho's intentions towards Connie.\n\nEventually, Pinky and Baravelli are sent to kidnap two of the rival college's star players to prevent them from playing in the big game. The intended victims (who are much larger men than Pinky and Baravelli) manage to kidnap the pair instead, removing their outer clothing and locking them in a room. Pinky and Baravelli make their escape by sawing their way out through the floor. The saws came from a tool bag Pinky carried with them that held their kidnappers' tools, which included, among other things, rope, chisels, hammers and at one point, a small pig. This is an example of the [[Surrealism|surreal]] edge of Marx Brothers humor.\n\nOne direct example of that influence occurs in the speakeasy scene. Two men are playing cards, and one says to the other, \"cut the cards\". Pinky happens to walk by at that moment, pulls a [[hatchet]] out of his trenchcoat and chops the deck in half. This none-too-subtle gag, recycled from the brothers' first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show, ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'' (1924), was repeated by [[Curly Howard]] against [[Moe Howard]] in [[The Three Stooges]]' short ''[[Ants in the Pantry]]'' (1936), and by [[Bugs Bunny]] in ''[[Bugs Bunny Rides Again]]'' (1948).\n\n==Reception==\n[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film \"aroused riotous laughter from those who packed the theatre\" on opening night. \"Some of the fun is even more reprehensible than the doings of these clowns in previous films,\" Hall wrote, \"but there is no denying that their antics and their patter are helped along by originality and ready wit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506E7D81E3EE633A25752C1A96E9C946394D6CF |title=Movie Review - Horse Feathers |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |author-link=Mordaunt Hall |date=August 11, 1932 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 21, 2015 }}</ref> \"Laffs galore, swell entertainment,\" wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'',<ref name=\"variety\" /> while ''[[Film Daily]]'' reported, \"Full of laughs that will rock any house.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 12, 1932 |title=Horse Feathers |url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume660newy#page/226/mode/2up |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, Inc. |page=3 }}</ref> [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the film \"a rather more slight and trivial affair than the other Marx offerings,\" but still acknowledged the Marxes as \"very special; there is no one else like Groucho or Harpo on stage or screen, and probably never will be.

Such women were considered \"easy\". Miss Bailey is shown to be involved with each of the characters played by the Brothers, as well as the principal antagonist Jennings.\n\nAt one point during the climactic football game, Wagstaff exclaims, \"Jumping anaconda!\" This is a \u2018minced oath\u2019, an expression used in sports stories of the time to show the colourful language used by coaches, without using actual samples, not then considered fit to print.

Groucho had delivered other jokes related to the stock market in the Brothers' preceding films (for example, \"The stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today\" in ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]''), and used Anaconda itself in a [[Eugene O\u2019Neill]] parody in 1930's [[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]].\n\n==Missing sequences==\n[[Image:Horse Feathers Burning College.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|right|In this now lost, deleted scene from ''Horse Feathers'', the Marx Brothers are seen playing poker as Huxley College goes up in flames around them]]\nThe only existing prints of this film are missing several minutes, owing to [[censorship]] and damage.
