Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or \"shell\", that can [[Brain\u2013computer interface|integrate]] a human brain rather than an [[artificial intelligence|AI]]. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a [[Cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO, Cutter, decides to use Killian as a [[counter-terrorism]] operative.\n\nA year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the counter-terrorism bureau [[Section 9]], working alongside operatives [[Batou]] and [[Togusa]] under [[Daisuke Aramaki|Chief Daisuke Aramaki]]. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as [[glitch]]es, is troubled as she doesn't clearly remembers her past. The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic [[geisha]] after the robot kills a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as [[Hideo Kuze|Kuze]], Killian breaks protocol and \"dives\" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a [[yakuza]] nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.\n\nKuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Now with [[Visual prosthesis|cybernetic eyes]], Batou kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals himself as a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian, where he urges her to question her own memories and to stop taking her medication as it actually helps to block her memories. Kuze then frees her and escapes.\n\nKillian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are [[Memory implantation|implanted]]. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated. Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter [[Motoko Kusanagi]] ran away from home a year ago and was arrested; while in custody, Motoko [[Death in custody|took her own life]]. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. \n\nBatou, Togusa and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. She and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects. Cutter deploys a \"spider-tank\" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear out the tank's Motor Control Center, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze asks Killian to join him in leaving this world, but Killian refuses and tells Kuze that he will always be with her in her ghost then fades out. A Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, now repaired and embracing her true [[Identity (social science)|identity]] as the Japanese Motoko, Killian reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Motoko Kusanagi|Major Mira Killian / Motoko Kusanagi]]\n** Kaori Yamamoto as young Motoko<ref name=\"Truffaut-Wong\">{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Truffaut-Wong |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-ghost-in-the-shell-twist-addresses-whitewashing-claims-in-a-disturbing-way-47138 |title=The 'Ghost In The Shell' Twist Addresses Whitewashing Claims In A Disturbing Way |work=Bustle |date=March 31, 2017 |access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Takeshi Kitano|\"Beat\" Takeshi Kitano]] as [[Daisuke Aramaki|Chief Daisuke Aramaki]]\n* [[Michael Pitt|Michael Carmen Pitt]] as [[Hideo Kuze|Kuze / Hideo]]<ref>{{cite press release|title=Paramount Pictures and Dreamworks Pictures' \"Ghost in the Shell\" Is in Production in New Zealand|url=https://business.facebook.com/notes/paramount-pictures/paramount-pictures-and-dreamworks-pictures-ghost-in-the-shell-is-in-production-i/10154147848862072|date=April 15, 2016|publisher=Paramount Pictures|via=Facebook|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n** Andrew Morris as young Hideo\n* [[Pilou Asb\u00e6k]] as Batou\n* [[Chin Han (actor, born 1969)|Chin Han]] as Togusa\n* [[Lasarus Ratuere]] as [[Ishikawa (Ghost in the Shell)|Carlos Ishikawa]]\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Dr. Ouelet<ref name=\"comingsoon.net\">{{cite web|author=CS |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/676453-ghost-in-the-shell-photo-released-as-production-begins |title=Ghost in the Shell Photo Released as Production Begins |work=ComingSoon.net |date=April 14, 2016 |access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Ferdinando]] as Cutter\n* [[Kaori Momoi]] as Hairi, Motoko's mother\n* [[Danusia Samal]] as [[List of Ghost in the Shell characters#Ladriya|Ladriya]]\n* [[Anamaria Marinca]] as Dr. Dahlin\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Dr. Osmond (uncredited)\n* Yutaka Izumihara as [[Saito (Ghost in the Shell)|Saito]]\n* [[Tawanda Manyimo]] as [[Boma (Ghost in the Shell)|Borma]]\n* [[Daniel Henshall]] as Skinny Man\n* [[Rila Fukushima]] as a [[geisha]] robot\n* [[Chris Obi]] as Ambassador\n* [[Adwoa Aboah]] as Lia\n* [[Pete Teo]] as Tony\n* Hugh Han as Data Host\n* [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] (deleted scene)<ref>{{cite web |last=Guan |first=Frank |title=New Tricky Song Means at Least One Thing About Ghost In the Shell Will Be Good |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/listen-to-the-new-tricky-song-from-ghost-in-the-shell.html |website=Vulture |access-date=March 31, 2017 |date=March 17, 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn the Japanese dub, [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]], [[Akio \u014ctsuka]] and [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] reprise the roles they played in the [[Mamoru Oshii]] films and the ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Stand Alone Complex]]'' television series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hadfield |first=James |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2017/04/12/films/film-reviews/hollywoods-ghost-shell-remake-misses-mark/ |title=Hollywood's 'Ghost in the Shell' remake misses the mark |work=The Japan Times |date=April 12, 2017 |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn 2008, [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] (who had handled U.S. theatrical distribution of ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' through its [[Go Fish Pictures]] banner) and [[Steven Spielberg]] acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga.
