It stars [[Paul Dano]] and [[John Cusack]] as the young and middle-aged Wilson, with [[Elizabeth Banks]] as his second wife [[Melinda Ledbetter]] and [[Paul Giamatti]] as his psychologist Dr. [[Eugene Landy]]. The title comes from Wilson's [[Love and Mercy|1988 song]].\n\nThe film alternates between Wilson's production of the album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and his treatment under Landy's 24-hour therapy program in the late 1980s. Wilson called the film \"very factual\",<ref name=\"Alchemy\" /> albeit containing parts that \"weren't actually as factual\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Slate|first1=Jeff|title=How Brian Wilson Found Inspiration in the Artists Working Beside Him|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/q-and-a/a49469/brian-wilson-memoir-i-am-brian-wilson-interview/|magazine=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=October 11, 2016}}</ref> He had little involvement with its making, although Ledbetter was relied upon for the 1980s portions. The cast and crew maintained that nothing in the film was a \"Hollywood\" embellishment and that everything was intended to be as truthful as possible. Conversely, Landy's son Evan felt that his father was unfairly portrayed. Some minor inaccuracies were noted by critics, a number of which relate to the minimal coverage devoted to Wilson's family and collaborators. Ledbetter said that Landy's treatment of Wilson \"was even worse\" than the film portrays.\n\n''Love and Mercy'' premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2014<ref name=\"Indiewire\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/tiff-toronto-intl-film-festival-gala-special-presentations-1201266480/ |title=Toronto Film Festival Lineup |access-date=July 22, 2014 |work=Variety |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723023810/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/tiff-toronto-intl-film-festival-gala-special-presentations-1201266480/ |archive-date=July 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=TIFFprofile>{{cite web|title=Love & Mercy|url=http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/specialpresentations/love-mercy|website=TIFF.net|publisher=Toronto International Film Festival|access-date=August 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811111844/http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/specialpresentations/love-mercy|archive-date=August 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and was released by [[Lionsgate]] and [[Roadside Attractions]] on June 5, 2015. It grossed $28.6 million over a $10 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, with Dano's performance garnering significant praise. It was nominated for two [[Golden Globe]]s: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] (Paul Dano) and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[One Kind of Love]]\"). A [[Music from Love & Mercy|soundtrack album]] that includes the original [[film score|score]] by [[Atticus Ross]] was released on August 14, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe film alternates between the 1960s and the 1980s. The early timeline begins with a young [[Brian Wilson]] suffering a panic attack on an airplane. After recovering, Brian convinces his brothers [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] and [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] to let him quit touring with [[the Beach Boys]] and instead focus on composition and studio work. Despite his father and his cousin [[Mike Love]]'s criticisms regarding the lyrics and production, Brian completes the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album. It is a critical hit, but sales are underwhelming. [[LSD]] is supplied to Wilson by a coterie of hippies who [[Brian Wilson is a genius|praise him as a \"genius\"]], and his mental health subsequently worsens. After the success of a new single, \"[[Good Vibrations]]\", he [[Collapse of Smile|fails to complete]] the album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', his would-be masterpiece. As Wilson's bandmates are left to finish a simplified version of the album, now titled ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', he learns that [[Murry Wilson|his father]] has sold the [[publishing rights]] to the Beach Boys' songs without their consent. This timeline ends with Wilson apathetic and detached from life.\n\nIn the 1980s, an older and heavily medicated Brian Wilson meets [[Melinda Ledbetter]], a Cadillac saleswoman. She begins a relationship with him, but is disturbed by the controlling influence Wilson's therapist and legal guardian Dr. [[Eugene Landy]] has over Wilson's life. Eventually, she disengages from the relationship, but not before providing evidence to Wilson's family that Landy has been made a beneficiary in his will, with help from Wilson's housekeeper Gloria Ramos. This leads to a restraining order being taken out to prevent Landy from seeing Wilson, who begins a new and more appropriate course of treatment. A few years later, Wilson bumps into Ledbetter again while walking across an intersection. They eventually marry, and Wilson completes ''Smile'' as [[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|his own solo album]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as [[Brian Wilson|Brian\u2013Future]]{{refn|group=nb|name=fn1}}\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Brian Wilson|Brian\u2013Past]]{{refn|group=nb|name=fn1|\"Brian\u2013Future\" and \"Brian\u2013Past\" are how these roles are officially credited.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Erik|title=Love & Mercy picks Brian Wilson's brain, finds strengths in his ears|url=https://www.avclub.com/review/love-mercy-picks-brian-wilsons-brain-finds-strengt-220232|publisher=[[The A.V.
