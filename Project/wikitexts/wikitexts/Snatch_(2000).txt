Set in the [[London]] criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots: one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter ([[Jason Statham]]) who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster ([[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]]) who is ready and willing to have his subordinates carry out severe and sadistic acts of violence.\n\nThe film features an assortment of characters, including [[Irish Travellers|Irish Traveller]] \"One Punch\" Mickey O'Neil ([[Brad Pitt]]), referred to as a \"[[Pikey]]\", arms-dealer Boris \"the Blade\" Yurinov ([[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]]), professional thief and gambling addict Franky \"Four-Fingers\" ([[Benicio del Toro]]), American gangster-jeweller Abraham Denovitz known as \"Cousin Avi\" ([[Dennis Farina]]), small-time crooks Sol ([[Lennie James]]) and Vinny ([[Robbie Gee]]), getaway driver Tyrone ([[Ade (actor)|Ade]]), and [[bounty hunter]] Bullet-Tooth Tony ([[Vinnie Jones]]). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, an intricate double plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and [[causality]], and a fast pace.\n\nThe film shares themes, ideas, and motifs with Ritchie's first film, ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]''. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, [[Jason Flemyng]], and Alan Ford.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter stealing an {{convert|86|carat|g|adj=on|lk=on}} diamond while dressed as an [[ultra-Orthodox Jew]] during a heist in [[Antwerp]], Franky \"Four-Fingers\" goes to London to see diamond dealer Doug \"The Head\" on behalf of [[New York (state)|New York]] jeweler and [[Jewish-American organized crime]] figure \"Cousin Avi\". One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from his brother, arms dealer and ex-[[KGB]] agent Boris \"The Blade\", then later calls Boris and encourages him to steal the diamond from Franky before he can turn it over to Doug.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Cockney]] boxing promoter and [[slot machine]] shop owner Turkish is persuaded by [[crime boss]] \"Brick Top\" to put his boxer \"Gorgeous George\" in a match against one of Brick Top's boxers. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy and Gorgeous George to purchase a [[travel trailer|caravan]] from a [[Irish clan|clan]] of [[Irish Travellers]], George gets challenged to a fistfight against Traveller [[bare-knuckle boxing]] champion Mickey O'Neil, who beats up and severely injures George. Turkish persuades Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey's mother. Brick Top grudgingly agrees, but only on the condition that Mickey will [[match fixing|throw the fight]] in the fourth round.\n\nBoris gives Franky a revolver in exchange for a favour: Franky is to place a bet on Boris' behalf at Brick Top's [[Bookmaker|bookies]]. Avi, knowing Franky has [[gambling addiction]], flies to London with his bodyguard \"Rosebud\" to pick up the diamond personally. Boris hires Vinny and Sol, two pawnbrokers and small-time crooks, to rob Franky while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes awry when they crash their car into Franky's van while trying to park, trapping Franky inside. Sol, Vinny, and their [[Crime scene getaway#Vehicle|getaway driver]] Tyrone are caught on camera and find no money at the bookies due to the bets being cancelled since Gorgeous George had to drop out, but manage to kidnap Franky in their escape. At their pawn shop, Sol and Vinny hold Franky captive with a sack over his head. Upon Boris' arrival, Sol and Vinny demand he gives them half of the cash when he sells the diamond, during which Vinny utters Boris' name. Realizing that his identity and betrayal has been exposed to Franky, Boris kills Franky by shooting him in the head, and leaves with the diamond.\n\nInstead of throwing the fight, Mickey accidentally knocks his opponent out with a single punch due to his overwhelming power. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his life savings and demands that Mickey fight again, and lose since the majority of the gamblers will now bet on him. Mickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys an even better caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left since Brick Top stole his savings. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish's gambling arcade and burn down Mickey's mother's caravan while she is asleep inside. Brick Top and his men then tracks down Tyrone, Sol and Vinny to kill them for robbing his bookies. Sol bargains for their lives by offering Brick Top the stolen diamond, and is given 48 hours to retrieve it.\n\nAvi and Doug hire \"Bullet-Tooth\" Tony to help them find Franky. When the trail leads to Boris, they kidnap him and retrieve the diamond, while being closely pursued by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone. Turkish and Tommy, who are on their way to purchase a gun from Boris, are driving on the same stretch of road at the time. When Tommy throws Turkish's carton of milk out of their car window, it splashes over Tony's windscreen, causing him to crash which accidentally kills Rosebud in the process. Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone's car. Tony and Avi are confronted by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone at a pub where Tony realizes that the trio's pistols are replicas, which he contrasts with his real handgun, intimidating them into leaving. The wounded Boris arrives with an [[assault rifle]] and a [[grenade launcher]] looking for the diamond, but is shot and killed by Tony, who wounds Tyrone at the same time. Sol and Vinny leave a wounded Tyrone and escape with the diamond, which Vinny hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, Vinny pretends to have misplaced the diamond, then accuses his dog, which he got earlier from the Irish Traveller clan, of eating it. When Avi tells Tony to kill the dog, Vinny gives in and produces the diamond from his pants, but the dog snatches the diamond away and runs off, presumably back to the Irish Travellers' campsite. Avi wildly fires at the fleeing dog, accidentally killing Tony. He gives up and returns to [[New York City]].\n\nMickey agrees to fight to avoid more carnage, but gets so drunk after his mother's wake that Turkish fears he will not make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down in the fourth round as agreed, Brick Top vows that his men will murder Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and his entire clan of Travellers.\n\nAt the fight, Mickey makes it to the fourth round as per Brick Top's plan, and gets knocked down by his opponent. But at the last moment, Mickey recovers and knocks out his opponent with one punch, much to the chagrin of Turkish, Tommy and Brick Top. Outside the arena, as Tommy, Turkish, and Mickey try to run for their lives, Brick Top and his men are ambushed and killed by the Travellers. It is revealed that this has all been planned out by Mickey to avenge his mother. In fact, Mickey purposely did not go down during the fight as he had secretly bet on himself to win.\n\nThe next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the Travellers' campsite deserted as Mickey and \"the pikeys\" have escaped with their winnings. When confronted by the police, they cannot explain why they are there, until Vinny's dog suddenly appears and they claim to be walking it. On their way back, they cross paths with Sol and Vinny, who are discovered and being put under arrest by the police for hiding Franky and Tony's bodies in the boot of their car. Sol and Vinny watch in defeat as Turkish and Tommy drive away with the dog (and the diamond).\n\nTurkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a [[squeaky toy]] that it had swallowed, and consequently discover the diamond in its stomach. They consult Doug about selling the diamond and he calls Avi, who returns to London to purchase it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Mickey O\u2019Neil\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Turkish\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Tommy\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Abraham \"Cousin Avi\" Denovitz\n* [[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]] as \"Brick Top\" Pulford\n* [[Robbie Gee]] as \"Vinny\" Vincent\n* [[Lennie James]] as \"Sol\" Solomon\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Franky Four-Fingers\n* [[Ade (actor)|Ade]] as Tyrone, the 'Getaway Driver'\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Boris \"The Blade\" Yurinov\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Bullet Tooth Tony\n* [[Adam Fogerty]] as Gorgeous George\n* [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] as Douglas \"Doug The Head\" Denovitz\n* [[Nicola and Teena Collins]] as Alex and Susi\n* [[Sorcha Cusack]] as Mrs O'Neil\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Darren\n* [[Goldie]] as Bad Boy Lincoln\n* [[Velibor Topi\u0107]] as The Russian\n* [[Sam Douglas]] as Rosebud\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Mullet\n* [[Andy Beckwith]] as Errol\n* [[Dave Legeno]] as John\n* [[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]] as Neil\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nA half-hour documentary of the production of the film was released featuring much of the cast along with Ritchie.<ref>''The Making of SNATCH''.

In his review, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while ostensibly rooted in the London underworld, Pitt's Irish traveller community were the most interesting element of the plot and the film's clearest predecessors were all American: ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' comics, [[Damon Runyon]] stories, and zany [[Marx Brothers]] comedies.
