In the film, Stone interviews [[Cuba]]n leader [[Fidel Castro]] on a diverse range of topics.  Stone and his film crew visited Castro in Cuba for three days in 2002, and the film was released in 2003, having its premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] early that year.\nThe film was partly produced by [[HBO]] and was planned for broadcast. Shortly before airtime, after Cuba executed three hijackers of a ferry to the United States and imprisoned more than 70 political dissidents, HBO pulled the program.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/oliver-stone-rewrites-history-again.html?_r=0 Oliver Stone Rewrites History \u2014 Again] - NY Times, Nov. 22, 2012.</ref> To this day, it still has not been given a video release in the USA.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]'' \u2013 2009 film by Oliver Stone of interviews with Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]].  \n*''[[The Putin Interviews]]'' \u2013 2017 film by Oliver Stone of interviews with [[Vladimir Putin]], President of Russia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n  \n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0342213|title=Comandante}}\n* {{rottentomatoes|comandante}}\n* [http://www.documentary.org/feature/natural-born-comandante-oliver-stone-meets-fidel-castro Natural Born 'Comandante': Oliver Stone Meets Fidel Castro]\n{{Fidel Castro}}\n{{Oliver Stone}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Fidel Castro]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n\n\n{{poli-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
