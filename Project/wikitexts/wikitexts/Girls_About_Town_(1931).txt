However, the women, who share a luxurious suite in an apartment building, have their African-American maid Hattie ([[Louise Beavers]]) disguise herself as their mother, waiting at the window, to avoid having to invite the men inside.\n\nWanda is getting tired of how she makes a living, but she and Marie go aboard a yacht the next night to divert rich practical joker Benjamin Thomas ([[Eugene Pallette]]) and his handsome business associate Jim Baker ([[Joel McCrea]]). Jim knows that the women are paid \"entertainment\", but quickly finds himself falling for Wanda anyway, and vice versa. (When Jerry pays her for her efforts, Wanda tears up the check.) Once Jim realizes she genuinely loves him, he asks her to marry him. Although she is initially reluctant, she agrees. However, she informs Jim that there is one complication: her estranged husband Alex ([[Anderson Lawler]]). She asks him for a divorce, and he agrees.\n\nMeanwhile, Benjamin's wife, who is divorcing him because of his stinginess, shows up and asks Marie to stop making a fool of him. Marie realizes that Mrs. Thomas ([[Lucille Gleason]]) is still in love with her husband, and comes up with a plan to cure him of his tightfisted ways. The next day, Marie steers Benjamin to the jewelry store where Mrs Thomas is waiting. Mrs Thomas, pretending not to see him, complains (in a loud voice) how cheap her husband is. Benjamin becomes so angry he buys Marie some expensive merchandise for about $50,000.\n\nThat night, Alex crashes the birthday party Marie has arranged for Benjamin. He tells Jim that he wants $10,000 or he will name Jim as the [[co-respondent]] in the divorce. Alex insinuates that Wanda is part of the blackmail scheme. Believing the lie, Jim breaks up with Wanda.\n\nWanda visits Alex in Brooklyn and demands he give the money back. He introduces her (as \"cousin Wanda\") to the ailing Mrs. Howard and their baby, the reasons he needs the money so desperately. He confesses that he got a divorce in Mexico 2 years before, and promises to pay her back once he is back on his feet financially. Touched, Wanda leaves without the check.\n\nWanda decides to auction off enough of her possessions to her friends to raise $10,000 and pay Jim back. She also asks Marie to return her jewelry. Wanda gives Jim the proceeds; even before that, however, he has come to his senses, and the couple reconcile. Marie gives Benjamin's gifts to his wife and reunites that couple.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kay Francis]] as Wanda Howard\n*[[Joel McCrea]] as Jim Baker\n*[[Lilyan Tashman]] as Marie Bailey\n*[[Eugene Pallette]] as Benjamin Thomas\n*[[Alan Dinehart]] as Jerry Chase\n*[[Lucile Gleason|Lucille Webster Gleason]] as Mrs Benjamin Thomas\n*Anderson Lawler as Alex Howard\n*[[Lucile Browne]] as Edna\n*[[George Barbier (actor)|George Barbier]] as Webster\n*[[Robert McWade]] as Simms\n*[[Louise Beavers]] as Hattie\n\nUncredited:\n*[[Adrienne Ames]] as Anne\n*[[Frances Bavier]] as Joy\n*[[Claire Dodd]] as Dot\n*[[Judith Wood]] as Winnie\n\n==Reception==\n[[Mordaunt Hall]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic, gave ''Girls About Town'' a qualified favorable review, writing, \"This handsomely staged and ably directed production is one that affords no little laughter, but unfortunately it is burdened in the latter stages by highly improbable serious sequences.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/93220/Girls-About-Town/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520075316/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/93220/Girls-About-Town/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 20, 2011|title=The Screen; Movietone News. |access-date=July 24, 2008 |first=Mordaunt |department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author-link=Mordaunt Hall|date=2011|last=Hall}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The House That Shadows Built]]'' (1931 promotional film by Paramount)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0021910|title=Girls About Town}}\n*{{tcmdb title|id=76414|title=Girls About Town}}\n\n{{George Cukor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Girls About Town}}\n[[Category:1931 films]]\n[[Category:1931 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Cukor]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
