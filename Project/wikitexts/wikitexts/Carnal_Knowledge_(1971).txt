It stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Candice Bergen]], and [[Rita Moreno]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70328/carnal-knowledge#overview|title= Carnal Knowledge|website= TCM|accessdate= March 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows the sexual exploits of two [[Amherst College]] [[roommate]]s over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy ([[Art Garfunkel]]) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst ([[Jack Nicholson]]) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, while Jonathan objectifies them. Jonathan frequently uses the term \"ballbuster\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective on womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman.\n\nThe film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged.\n\nIn the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes.\n\nSandy shyly meets Susan ([[Candice Bergen]]) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unbeknownst to Sandy, she is also pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to persuade Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up.\n\nPart II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \"perfect woman.\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie ([[Ann-Margret]]), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of his physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, spending long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working all day at a nine-to-five job. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with \"poison.\"\n\nSandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan \"do all the right things.\" He relates how they are \"patient with each other\" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not \"meant to be enjoyable with the person you love.\"\n\nSandy and Susan end their relationship. Sandy begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal). Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan, and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Sandy complains privately to Jonathan that Cindy gets so busy handing out instructions in bed that it's like a close-order drill. Jonathan suggests to Sandy that they trade partners, to \"liven things up a bit.\" Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who calls the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.\n\nPart III opens with now-middle-aged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled \"Ballbusters on Parade\" to Sandy (also middle-aged) and Sandy's 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer ([[Carol Kane]]). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that \"she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet.\" Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself.\n\nTime passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute ([[Rita Moreno]]) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and \"perfection,\" which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Jonathan Fuerst\n* [[Art Garfunkel|Arthur Garfunkel]] as Sandy\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Susan\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Bobbie\n* [[Rita Moreno]] as Louise\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Jennifer\n* Cynthia O'Neal as Cindy\n\n==Production==\nThe script was originally written as a play. Jules Feiffer sent it to Mike Nichols, who thought it would work better as a film.<ref>Nichols Meets Jules Feiffer: Mike Nichols</ref>  The script contains numerous curse words, some of which were rarely heard on the screen before this time.\n\nThe $5 million budget was provided by Joseph E. Levine of which $1 million went to Nichols. The movie was shot in Vancouver.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n==Legal problems==\nThe changes in the morals of American society of the 1960s and 1970s and the general receptiveness by the public to frank discussion of sexual issues was sometimes at odds with local community standards. A theatre in [[Albany, Georgia]], showed the film; on January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of \"distributing obscene material\". His conviction was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]]. On June 24, 1974, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in ''[[Miller v. California]]'', {{ussc|413|15|1973}} (the ''Miller'' standard), and overturned the conviction<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/censored/walkthrough/film2|title=University of Virginia Library Online Exhibits - CENSORED: Wielding the Red Pen|website=explore.lib.virginia.edu}}</ref> in ''[[Jenkins v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|418|153|1974}}. The court also said that, {{blockquote|Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that ''Carnal Knowledge'' could not be found \u2026 to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within \u2026 material which may constitutionally be found \u2026 \"patently offensive\" \u2026 While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including \"ultimate sexual acts\" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene\u2026 Appellant's showing of the film ''Carnal Knowledge'' is simply not the \"public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain\" which we said was punishable\u2026}}\n\n[[Avco Embassy]] re-released the film to theaters after the Supreme Court ruling, using the tagline \"The United States Supreme Court has ruled that 'Carnal Knowledge' is {{em|not obscene.}} See it now!\"<ref>Advertisement, [[The New York Times]], 17 July 1974, p. 24.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four and called it \"clearly Mike Nichols' best film. It sets out to tell us certain things about these few characters and their sexual crucifixions, and it succeeds. It doesn't go for cheap or facile laughs, or inappropriate symbolism, or a phony kind of contemporary feeling ... Nicholson, who is possibly the most interesting new movie actor since James Dean, carries the film, and his scenes with Ann-Margret are masterfully played.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/carnal-knowledge-1971 |title=Carnal Knowledge |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 6, 1971 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was also positive, calling it \"a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents\" that was \"not only very funny, but in a casual way\u2014in the way of something observed in a half-light\u2014more profound than much more ambitious films.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (July 1, 1971). \"Film: 'Carnal Knowledge'\".

That may be the case, but the movie isn't convincing.\"<ref>Kael, Pauline (July 3, 1971). \"The Current Cinema\". ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 44.</ref>\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gives the film a score of 88% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 7.70/10.
