In actuality, the Clock family of tiny people known as \"Borrowers\" are secretly living in the house, taking things without being seen by \"human beans\". Lawyer Ocious P. Potter informs the Lenders that he cannot find the [[will and testament|will]] of Victoria\u2019s late aunt Mary Alabaster \u2013 the family\u2019s only evidence that their house rightfully belongs to them \u2013 and he has already made plans to demolish their house and build condominiums, forcing the Lenders to move.\n\nPod Clock and his children, Arrietty and Peagreen, make their way through the kitchen to \"borrow\" a battery to bring back to his wife, Homily. Arrietty treats herself to ice cream in the freezer, and is accidentally trapped inside as the Lenders return. Pod rescues her via the ice dispenser, but is forced to leave one of his gadgets behind. Later, Arrietty ventures out alone and is caught by Pete, who explains that the house is being demolished in the absence of the will. Arrietty warns her family and, despite her parents\u2019 misgivings, Pod reluctantly agrees and Pete smuggles the Clocks onto the Lenders\u2019 moving truck to join them at their new home. Pete repairs and returns Pod\u2019s gadget to him, earning his trust. As the truck pulls away, Arrietty and Peagreen accidentally fall out, and make their way back to the house.\n\nPotter soon arrives at the house, revealing that he lied to the Lenders; having a distrust of banks, Mrs. Alabaster had actually hidden her will \u2013 officially leaving her property to the family \u2013 inside the house. He finds the will in a hidden safe and prepares to burn it, but Arrietty and Peagreen flee with the document. Discovering the Clocks\u2019 home beneath the floorboards, Potter summons Exterminator Jeff to eliminate the Borrowers, and is sprayed with caustic foam and electrocuted in the process. Police Officer Oliver Steady responds to the disturbance, but Potter manages to throw off his suspicions while Arrietty and Peagreen escape with the will.\n\nPeagreen accidentally stumbles and falls into an empty milk bottle and is collected and brought back to the [[dairy]], with Potter, Jeff, and Jeff\u2019s flatulent [[bloodhound]] in pursuit, followed by Pete, Pod, and Homily. Spud Spiller, an \"outie\" Borrower living on the street, takes Arrietty to the dairy, where Pod rescues Peagreen from the assembly line. Potter captures the Borrowers and leaves them to drown in liquid cheese. Spiller taunts Potter, who drops him in a machine, seemingly killing him, and departs with the will. Pete saves the Clocks, and Jeff, realizing Potter's scheme, has a change of heart and drives them to City Hall to stop Potter from arranging the house\u2019s demolition.\n\nIn retaliation for Potter\u2019s rudeness, the City Hall clerk gives him confusing directions. Eventually reaching the demolitions office, Potter is confronted by Jeff and Pete, but then pushes them out of the way. He then enters the office, only to find himself tricked and locked in a supply room. The Clocks tie him up with electrical tape, but he breaks free and recaptures them. Before Potter can vacuum up the family, Spiller arrives with an army of Borrowers who subdue him, and Pod delivers a warning to Potter on behalf of all Borrowers. They disappear as Pete and Jeff arrive with Officer Steady. Pete shows Steady the will, proving Potter\u2019s plan to cheat the Lenders out of their house, and Potter is promptly arrested.\n\nThe Lenders move back into their home, as do the Clocks, now with food and assistance from Pete. As the Clocks enjoy the company of their old Borrower friends, Minty Branch, Swag Moss and Dustbunny Bin, Arrietty and Spiller sneak away to ride his [[aerosol paint]]-propelled roller skate.\n\nDuring the pre-credits, Potter attempts to explain the existence of the Borrowers, only for the whole station{{snd}}both cops and convicts{{snd}}to laugh at him uproariously. The film closes with Potter getting his mugshots taken (which he actually seems to enjoy).\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[John Goodman]] as Ocious P.
