It was released on April 1, 1994, and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $3 million against its $30 million budget. While initially unsuccessful at the box office, it has since gained a [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy Alto is a failing actor living in Los Angeles. After increasing frustration with his career going nowhere and with crime in the city, Jimmy, along with his \"spaced-out\" best friend William, decides to take the law into his own hands.\n\nAfter losing his job as a waiter, Jimmy transforms himself into \"Jericho,\" leader of a mock-vigilante group that videotapes criminals and then turns them over to the police. Jimmy enjoys the free publicity, anonymously, but eventually the police begin to close in on him, resulting in a tense standoff at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Jimmy Alto / Jericho\n* [[Christian Slater]] as William\n* [[Victoria Abril]] as Lorraine De La Pe\u00f1a\n* [[Robert LaSardo]] as ATM Robber\n* [[Earl Billings]] as Police Captain\n* [[Jason Beghe]] as Detective\n* [[Rob Weiss]] as Himself / Director of \"Urban Nomad\"\n* [[Chad McQueen]] as Himself / Audition Partner\n* [[Barry Levinson]] as Himself / Director of \"Life Story\"\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Himself (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n[[Robbie Robertson]] created music for the film and produced the soundtrack, with [[Howard Drossin]] providing additional music.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] give the film a 22% approval rating from a sample of 23 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jimmy_hollywood |title=Jimmy Hollywood (1994) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref> Roger Ebert gave the film 2{{frac|1|2}} stars out of 4.
