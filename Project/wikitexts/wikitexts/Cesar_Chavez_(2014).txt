The film stars [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Chavez. [[John Malkovich]] co-stars as the owner of a large industrial grape farm who leads the opposition to Chavez's organizing efforts. It premiered in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlin\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_21524.html |title=Berlinale Special 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |work=berlinale}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows [[Cesar Chavez]]'s efforts to organize 50,000 farm workers in [[California]]. Some of them were [[Bracero Program|braceros]]\u2014temporary workers from [[Mexico]] permitted to live and work in the United States in agriculture, and required to return to Mexico if they stopped working. Working conditions are very poor for the farmworkers, who also suffer from [[racism]] and brutality at the hands of the employers and local Californians.\n\nTo help the workers, Cesar Chavez (Michael Pe\u00f1a) forms a labor union known as the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW). Chavez's efforts are opposed, sometimes violently, by the owners of the large industrial farms where the farmworkers work. The film touches on several major nonviolent campaigns by the UFW: the [[Delano grape strike]], the [[Salad Bowl strike]], and the [[1975 Modesto march]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as [[Cesar Chavez]]\n* [[America Ferrera]] as [[Helen Fabela Ch\u00e1vez|Helen Ch\u00e1vez]]\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Dolores Huerta]]\n* Darion Basco as [[Larry Itliong]]\n* [[Yancey Arias]] as Gilbert Padilla\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Jerry Cohen\n* [[Michael Cudlitz]] as Sherriff Smith\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Bogdanovich Junior\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Bogdanovich Senior\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Fred Ross\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Richard Chavez\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Victore Representative\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] (cameo)<ref name=\"McClintock\">[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/participant-media-diego-luna-chavez-333272 McClintock, Pamela. \"Participant Media Picks Up Diego Luna's Historical Drama 'Chavez' for North America.\"] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]].''

June 5, 2012.</ref> Many writers and producers had tried for years to obtain the rights to Chavez's life story, but failed.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" /><ref name=\"Nervous\" />  Pearson negotiated for two years with Chavez's heirs before he and production partner, television producer Larry Meli, were able to secure the rights to Chavez's life in 2011. Pearson says his script focuses on the positive aspects of Chavez's personality, family life, and public accomplishments, but it is not a whitewash. Pearson and the producers reviewed the script with the Chavez family. Many of the comments made by the family, as well as anecdotes told by them, made it into the script.  Pearson also relied heavily on archival material held by the Cesar Chavez Foundation.  The script focuses primarily on the grape boycotts and strikes of the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nThe producers of ''Chavez'' include Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Pablo Cruz (all principals of [[Canana Films]]); John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon, and Russell Smith (principals in Malkovich's production company, [[Mr. Mudd]]); writer Keir Pearson; and TV producer Larry Meli.<ref name=\"McClintock\" /> In June 2012, production company [[Participant Media]] purchased the North American distribution rights to the film, and Participant Media's [[Jeff Skoll]] and Jonathan King were added as executive producers.<ref name=\"McClintock\" />\n\n''Chavez'' is directed by Diego Luna. The film is only Luna's second motion picture, and is his first film whose primary language is English. Luna said that directing in both English (for the main actors) and Spanish (for the extras) was a struggle.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Michael Pe\u00f1a Labor Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Auditorium.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Pe\u00f1a was master-of-ceremonies at the induction of the [[Farm Worker Movement]] into the [[Labor Hall of Fame]] and dedication of the Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Auditorium at the U.S. Department of Labor in March 2012.]]\n[[Chicago]]-born Michael Pe\u00f1a stars as Chavez, the Mexican American labor leader born in [[Yuma, Arizona]], in 1927. Pe\u00f1a says he knew almost nothing about Cesar Chavez prior to taking the role.  His father, a Mexican farmer who emigrated to the United States, almost wept when Pe\u00f1a told him that he was going to play Cesar Chavez. Pe\u00f1a says he extensively studied historical records to gain a better understanding of Chavez. Because Pe\u00f1a keeps his hair very short, he had to wear a wig during the production.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nAmerica Ferrera was cast as Helen, the wife of Cesar Chavez who played a quiet, behind-the scenes role in Chavez's work. In contrast to Michael Pe\u00f1a, Ferrera (who was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], to parents who had emigrated from [[Honduras]]) said she had learned a great deal about who Cesar Chavez was while growing up and in school. Ferrera said she met several times with Helen Ch\u00e1vez to learn more about her role in the farmworker movement. Ferrera says that she learned that Helen Ch\u00e1vez pushed her husband hard to keep the farmworker movement alive, all while raising eight children. Ferrera called the role daunting.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nRosario Dawson was cast as [[Dolores Huerta]], the [[New Mexico]]-born daughter of a union activist and New Mexico state assemblyman who co-founded the United Farm Workers with Chavez.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" /> Dawson admitted that she did not know much about Dolores Huerta when she took the role. But, she says, she spoke with Huerta to research the role, and the more she learned the more impressed she was. She also admitted to being \"a little frightened about making sure that I get it right.\"<ref name=\"Nervous\">[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/rosario-dawson-nervous-next-role-dolores-huerta_n_1429354.html Chavez, Andrea Long. \"Rosario Dawson Nervous to Play Dolores Huerta in Cesar Chavez Biopic, Huerta Thinks It's Awesome.\"] [[The Huffington Post]]. April 17, 2012. Accessed 2012-10-14.</ref> Huerta has expressed her happiness that Dawson took the role.<ref name=\"Nervous\" />\n\nJohn Malkovich became involved with ''Chavez'' through his role as producer. [[Diego Luna]] convinced him to take the role of an abusive grape-grower. Malkovich agreed to the role because he admired Luna's previous film, and wished to take part in telling an important story about fairness. Actor [[Gabriel Mann]] plays another abusive agricultural producer. Mann says he took the role because he felt it was a timely story that spoke to what happens when workers lack union protections.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\n===Production locations and notes===\nMost of ''Chavez'' was shot in Mexico.  In part, Mexico offered much lower production costs, and was where most of the producers lived and worked.  But many rural and urban parts of Mexico still look as California did in the 1960s, which proved critical in obtaining a sense of visual realism for the film. A portion of the picture was filmed in [[Hermosillo]]. The city, which is ethnically diverse, was able to provide a large number of [[Anglo]]-looking actors to portray non-Hispanic Americans. Workers in Hermosillo's numerous Chinese restaurants were recruited to portray the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] agricultural workers whom Chavez also sought to organize. The city's [[Art Deco]] public library served as the headquarters of one of the large agricultural companies that Chavez dealt with, and a {{convert|40|acre|m2}} field outside Hermosillo served as a farm near [[Delano, California]]. Scenes in grape fields were filmed in vineyards in the Mexican state of [[Sonora]], where grape-growers still drape grape vines over wooden crosses, as Californians did in the 1960s. The production built shacks in the Sonoran grape fields to replicate the housing of migrant workers in California in the 1960s. The shooting in the Sonoran grape fields was difficult. The production was afflicted with dust storms and a tremendous number of insects. It was also terribly hot, and several actors collapsed on the set from [[dehydration]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nHistorical accuracy was important to the filmmakers. In addition to choosing locations which looked like California in the 1960s, actors were taught to speak in a [[Chicano]] dialect typical of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Dialect coach Claudia Vazquez says that dialect is very different from the Spanish and Spanish-inflected English spoken by many Mexican Americans in California today.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nThe film has a production budget of $10 million, nearly all of which came from Mexican investors.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n<!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and Movie Tab ratings, you should also update the \"accessdate\" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. -->\n''Cesar Chavez'' received a mixed reception from critics upon its release.
