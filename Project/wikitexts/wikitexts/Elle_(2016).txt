She was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and won several Best Actress awards, including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]], [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress|C\u00e9sar Award]], [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress|National Society of Film Critics Award]], [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|New York Film Critics Circle Award]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress|Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award]], [[Gotham Independent Film Awards 2016#Best Actress|Gotham Independent Film Award]], and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead|Independent Spirit Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nMich\u00e8le Leblanc is [[rape]]d in her home by an assailant in a ski mask. She then cleans up the mess and resumes her life. She is the head of a successful [[video game]] company, where her male employees are alternately resentful of or infatuated with her. She carries on an affair with Robert, the husband of her friend and business partner Anna, and flirts with her married neighbor Patrick. Mich\u00e8le feels detached from her son Vincent, who submits to his abusive, pregnant girlfriend Josie. She has a contentious relationship with her mother, Ir\u00e8ne, whom she resents for her [[narcissism]] and involvements with younger men. Furthermore, she is the daughter of an infamous [[mass murder]]er whose [[parole]] hearing is approaching. Haunted by her father's actions, Mich\u00e8le is wary of law enforcement and does not report her rape to police.\n\nMich\u00e8le grows increasingly suspicious of the men in her life. She receives harassing text messages from her assailant at a blocked number, indicating he is [[stalking]] her. She at first suspects Kurt, a particularly resentful employee, when a [[CGI animation|CGI]] animation of a monster raping her is emailed to everyone at the company. She [[Pepper spray|pepper-sprays]] a man lurking outside her house, only to find out it is her ex-husband Richard, who was checking on her safety. She later discovers that another employee, who has been infatuated with her, created the animation but did not rape her.\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], Ir\u00e8ne suffers a [[stroke]] and begs her daughter to go see her father before she dies in hospital. Mich\u00e8le is later attacked in her home by the assailant and, after stabbing his hand and unmasking him, learns that he is Patrick. Though she now knows his identity and realizes that he is able to enter her home despite having her locks changed, she still does not call the police and takes no measures to increase her home security.\n\nMich\u00e8le decides to visit her father after his parole application is rejected, only to find that he has hanged himself hours before she arrives. On the way home from the prison, she gets into a car crash in a secluded area. Rather than calling an ambulance, she first tries to call her friends, and then decides to call Patrick. After he rescues her from the car and bandages her, Mich\u00e8le courts a brazenly dangerous sexual relationship with him. She engages in a vivid rape scenario with him. The two of them walk a delicate line in which Patrick has to feel as though he is raping Mich\u00e8le, even though she consents to the roleplay.\n\nMich\u00e8le grows increasingly disillusioned with her life leading up to the launch party for her company's new video game. She confesses to Anna that she was having an affair with Robert. As Patrick drives her home, Mich\u00e8le professes that she is no longer in denial about their unhealthy relationship and claims she intends to call the police. She takes her time walking in front of his parked car after getting out, and then makes a point of leaving her gate unlocked. Patrick enters and attacks her in an ambiguous encounter that [[Grey rape|blurs the line between rape and consent]], but Vincent, who was already in the house, sneaks up behind Patrick and bashes him in the back of the skull. Mich\u00e8le appears to remain largely composed, but Patrick is seemingly confused as he dies.\n\nMich\u00e8le speaks briefly with Patrick's wife Rebecca as she is moving out of the neighbourhood. Rebecca is placid and expresses gratitude to Mich\u00e8le for being able to temporarily \"satisfy Patrick's needs\"\u2014implying that she was aware on some level that the two were sexually involved and that Patrick had inclinations she couldn't satisfy. Vincent is now more assertive in his relationship and career, while Mich\u00e8le reconciles with both Josie and Anna; the latter offers to move in with her now that they have both severed their relationships with Robert.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Isabelle Huppert]] as Mich\u00e8le Leblanc\n* [[Laurent Lafitte]] as Patrick, Mich\u00e8le's neighbor\n* [[Anne Consigny]] as Anna\n* [[Charles Berling]] as Richard Casamayou\n* [[Virginie Efira]] as Rebecca, Patrick's wife\n* [[Judith Magre]] as Ir\u00e8ne Leblanc, Mich\u00e8le's mother\n* [[Christian Berkel]] as Robert\n* [[Jonas Bloquet]] as Vincent, Mich\u00e8le's son\n* [[Alice Isaaz]] as Josie\n* [[Vimala Pons]] as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\n* [[Rapha\u00ebl Lenglet]] as Ralf\n* Arthur Mazet as Kevin, Mich\u00e8le's employee\n* [[Lucas Prisor]] as Kurt, Mich\u00e8le's employee\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\n[[Paul Verhoeven]] stated that he felt the movie  was an opportunity for him to do \"something very different to anything I've done before.

And she does that in an absolutely unique way.\"<ref name=\"Verhoeven Variety 20151128\"/> He also said in an interview with ''[[Film Comment]]'':\n<blockquote>\nShe's one of the most brilliant actors I've ever met in my life. She's so extremely special and is able to avoid any clich\u00e9 in any situation, always finding a different way of doing things. She comes up with all kinds of extra details that you wouldn't even dream of, that I would never come up with on my own. She's not only a great actress but she is also especially imaginative and creative in her approach to the character. I didn't have to tell her anything about Mich\u00e8le because it was clear from the first shot that she knew exactly what her character would do and how she would behave in whatever circumstance. She is extremely audacious and she really had no problem with anything that was in the script, so I have an enormous respect for her.<ref name=\"Film Comment 20160112\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nDuring the rape scene, Isabelle Huppert struggles and then says 'Arr\u00eate!' ('Stop it!', in French), which was not written in the script. \"It was very violent, I must say. I was a little scared, too. So I had to make them understand that they shouldn't go any further... Sometimes, when there are very physical scenes, like this one, you can hurt yourself. It's part of the things that you don't understand. It was not planned that I say it, even less in French.
