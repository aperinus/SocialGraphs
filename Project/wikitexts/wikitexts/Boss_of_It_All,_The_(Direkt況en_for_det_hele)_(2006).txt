But, for years, he has pretended that the real boss lives in America and communicates with the staff only by e-mail. That way, all the unpopular decisions can be attributed to the absentee manager, while all the popular ones to him directly.  But now, the prospective buyer insists on meeting the big boss in person. In a panic, the owner hires a failed, over-intellectualizing actor to portray this imaginary boss, and the actor proceeds to improvise all his lines, to the consternation of both the buyer and the company staff, who finally get to meet their ghostly boss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jens Albinus]] as The Boss of It All / Kristoffer / Svend E\n* [[Peter Gantzler]] as Ravn, the owner\n* [[Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson]] as Finnur\n* [[Benedikt Erlingsson]] as Interpreter\n* [[Iben Hjejle]] as Lise\n* [[Henrik Prip]] as Nalle\n* [[Mia Lyhne]] as Heidi A.\n* [[Casper Christensen]] as Gorm\n* [[Louise Mieritz]] as Mette\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Spencer\n* [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]] as Kisser\n* Anders Hove<!-- 'Anders Hove' links to a politician of the 1880s.
