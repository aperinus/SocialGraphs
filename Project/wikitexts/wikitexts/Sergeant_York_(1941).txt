York]], one of the most decorated American soldiers of [[World War I]]. Directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and starring [[Gary Cooper]] in the title role, the film was a critical and commercial success, and became [[1941 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1941]].\n\nThe film was based on York's diary, as edited by [[Tom Skeyhill]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:43758~T1 |title=Sergeant York Review |publisher=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=2008-07-25}}</ref> and adapted by [[Harry Chandlee]], Abem Finkel, [[John Huston]], [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard E. Koch]], and Sam Cowan (uncredited).  York refused, several times, to authorize a film version of his life story, but finally yielded to persistent efforts to finance the creation of an interdenominational Bible school.  The story that York insisted on Cooper for the title role comes from a telegram that producer Jesse L. Lasky wrote to Cooper pleading with him to accept the part, to which he signed York's name.<ref>{{cite book|first=David D.|last=Lee|title=Sergeant York: An American Hero|location=Lexington, Kentucky|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|date=1985|ISBN= 978-0813190280|page=105ff}}</ref>\n\nCooper went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, while the film also won [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and was nominated in nine other categories, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor ([[Walter Brennan]]), and Supporting Actress ([[Margaret Wycherly]]). The [[American Film Institute]] ranked the film 57th in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers|its 100 most inspirational American movies]]. It also rated Alvin York 35th in its list of the top [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains|50 heroes in American cinema]].\n\nIn 2008, ''Sergeant York'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBefore America's entry into World War I, Alvin York is a poor, young farmer in rural [[Tennessee]], living with his widowed mother, sister, and younger brother. Alvin's leisure time is spent fighting and getting drunk with friends. Alvin's goal is to purchase a piece of farmland, fertile \"bottomland\". Alvin works hard to acquire the price for the land, and is given an extension by the owner. Alvin's sharpshooting skills enable him to raise the money needed, but the owner reneges, making Alvin angry and bitter. En route to seek revenge, Alvin and his mule are struck by lightning. The incident prompts Alvin's conversion to [[Christianity]].\n\nWhen the U.S. enters World War I, Alvin seeks exemption as a [[conscientious objector]], which is denied. Alvin is torn between fighting for his country and the [[Thou shalt not kill|biblical prohibition against killing]]. His sympathetic commanding officer gives him leave to go home and come to a decision. Alvin reconciles his moral conflict after reading the biblical injunction to [[Render unto Caesar|\"render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\"]]\n\nDuring the [[Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive]], York's qualms vanish when he sees his friends and comrades being killed as they assault a strong German position. With his superiors dead or incapacitated, he takes charge. He infiltrates the German lines by himself and finds a position that lets him [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] the main German defensive trench. He kills so many German soldiers that they eventually surrender to him en masse. One of the prisoners of war treacherously grenades Alvin's good friend, \"Pusher\" Ross, and is gunned down by York. He and the handful of survivors from his unit lead their many captives behind their lines, but have a hard time finding anyone to take the Germans off their hands. The officer who finally does is astonished to learn that so few men captured so many of the enemy.\n\nYork is decorated and hailed as a national hero, but desires to return home. He rejects commercial offers that would make him wealthy, explaining that he could not take money for doing his duty. York returns home to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Gracie. To his surprise, the state has purchased the bottomland farm and built a house for Gracie and him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as [[Alvin C.

This was influenced by the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], which occurred while the film was still playing in theaters.
