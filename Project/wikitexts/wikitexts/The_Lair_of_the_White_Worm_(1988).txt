The film was written and directed by [[Ken Russell]] and stars [[Amanda Donohoe]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Peter Capaldi]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nAngus Flint ([[Peter Capaldi]]) is a Scottish archaeology student excavating the site of a convent at the [[Derbyshire]] [[bed and breakfast]] run by the Trent sisters, Mary ([[Sammi Davis]]) and Eve ([[Catherine Oxenberg]]). He unearths an unusual skull which appears to be that of a large snake. Angus believes it may be connected to the local legend of the d'Ampton 'worm', a mythical snake-like creature from ages past said to have been slain in Stonerich Cavern by John d'Ampton, the ancestor of current Lord of the Manor, James d'Ampton ([[Hugh Grant]]).\n\nWhen a pocket watch is discovered in Stonerich Cavern, James comes to believe that the d'Ampton worm may be more than a legend. The watch belonged to the Trent sisters' father, who disappeared a year earlier near Temple House, the stately home of the beautiful and seductive Lady Sylvia Marsh ([[Amanda Donohoe]]).\n\nThe enigmatic Lady Sylvia is in fact an immortal priestess to the ancient snake god, Dionin. As James correctly predicted, the giant snake roams the caves which connect Temple House with Stonerich Cavern. Lady Sylvia steals the skull and abducts Eve Trent, intending to offer her as the latest in a long line of sacrifices to her snake-god.\n\nBefore Lady Sylvia can execute her evil plan, Angus and James rescue Eve and destroy both Lady Sylvia and the giant snake. However, Lady Sylvia bites Angus before she dies, and Angus finds himself cursed to carry on the vampiric, snake-like condition, after he finds, to his shock, that the snake anti-venom he used was actually a new form of arthritis medication he got by mistake. When Lord D'Ampton invites him for a dinner celebration, Angus sinisterly smiles and accepts his offer.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Lord James D'Ampton\n* [[Amanda Donohoe]] as Lady Sylvia Marsh\n* [[Catherine Oxenberg]] as Eve Trent\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Angus Flint\n* [[Sammi Davis]] as Mary Trent\n* [[Stratford Johns]] as Peters\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Ernie\n* [[Imogen Claire]] as Dorothy Trent\n* Chris Pitt as Kevin\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Nurse Gladwell\n* [[Christopher Gable]] as Joe Trent\n\n== Production ==\n{{cleanup rewrite|section=yes|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Development===\nThe movie was made as part of a three-picture deal Russell had with [[Vestron Pictures]] following the success of Russell's ''[[Gothic (film)|Gothic]]'' (1986). Vestron told their executive [[Dan Ireland]], who was an admirer of Russell, that if the director could come up with a horror movie, they would finance his planned prequel to ''[[Women in Love (film)|Women in Love]]'', ''[[The Rainbow (1989 film)|The Rainbow]]'' (eventually filmed in 1989).<ref name=\"hell\"/>\n\nRussell was an admirer of [[Bram Stoker]] and had written an adaptation of ''[[Dracula]]'' that had never been filmed. Someone suggested the director read ''Lair of the White Worm'' which Stoker wrote shortly before his death.<ref name=Nutman />\n\n===Script===\nRussell was \"disappointed\" by the novel. \"There are touches of the master there. ''Dracula'' is a masterful novel: the psychological game the book plays is very interesting, and the Freudian elements are very deep, but those aspects are not present in ''Worm''. What I did find was something else that took its place, in a  sense, and that was for once you didn't have to go to Transylvania for the terror, it happened up the road in Derbyshire.\"<ref name=Nutman />\n\nHe added that \"Stoker tried to write something beyond what he'd already written in ''Dracula''. Unfortunately, his faculties had given way, and he couldn\u2019t realize his imagination. It seems potentially more imaginative than ''Dracula'', yet falls far short of itself in terms of credibility.\u201d <ref name=Nutman />\n\nRussell said \"It's very similar to ''Dracula'', but instead of being gothic, it's a very English story . . . Instead of bats, it has a snake, and instead of a man, a woman.\"<ref>Outrageous movie director's wild about Oscar\nDan Yakir Toronto Star 18 May 1988: D1.</ref>\n\nThe director thought \"the term 'horror movie' covered a whole strata of possibilities\" and he thought ''Lair'', \"while it certainly has plenty of horror elements to it... I consider it to be more of a whodunnit thriller in one respect\u2014 or more precisely, a what-dunnit.\"<ref name=Nutman />\n\nRussell used the song \"[[Lambton Worm|The Lambton Worm]]\" in the film.<ref name=Nutman />\n\nRussell says he took \"the spine of the novel and used that as the film's backbone, and that is the snake-worshipping cult. Stoker created a rather ineffectual villain; it\u2019s the villainess who interested me more, the priestess who caters to the dietary needs of the worm. The worm really is the character that steals the show. And as with the Loch Ness monster... there is the assumption that a land-based creature of this sort could still exist under the right conditions\u2014 which \nin the story is this huge cavern called [[Thor's Cave|Thor\u2019s Cave]] in Derbyshire, located next to a snake-like river.\"<ref name=Nutman />\n\nRussell said he thought the story would have \"more credibility if set in modern times\" and based the characters on \"interesting people I know in the wilds where I live in the Lake District.\"<ref name=Nutman />\n\n===Casting===\nIreland says that Russell originally wanted to cast [[Tilda Swinton]], but she turned down the role after reading the script. [[Amanda Donohoe]] was cast instead. Ireland also claims that Russell made the film partly as a tribute to [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref name=\"hell\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqe2brJTEFU  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/Vqe2brJTEFU |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Dan Ireland on The Lair of the White Worm |website=Trailers from Hell on You Tube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nDonohoe says Russell sent her a script with a note saying \"I don't know if you'll be interested in this little bit of nonsense but please read it anyway.\" She read it and agreed to play Lady Sylvia because, she said, it gave her \"the opportunity to play a woman who is basically a fantasy woman. There are no boundaries. Therefore, I could do exactly as I chose with that lady.... I didn't want her to be some sort of vampire bimbo. I really wanted her to be a sort of incredibly sophisticated and ageless woman.\"<ref>AT THE MOVIES\nGelder, Lawrence Van. New York Times 21 Oct 1988: C.10.</ref>\n\n\"I always admire someone who really dares to be bad,\" said Donohoe of Russell. \"Even his actors - people like [[Oliver Reed]] - have always impressed me that way. They can be brilliant or perfectly dreadful, but they're never boring. I'm fairly serious about acting and integrity, that films should have some real vrumph to them and say something about life. And I'd just been on this string of films and television films in the last two years, all pretty heavy stuff, and I thought 'Well, why not do a film that doesn't mean anything at all?'\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Amanda Donohoe had her doubts about doing a horror flick |last=Lacey|first= Liam|newspaper= The Globe and Mail|date= 12 Oct 1988|page= C5}}</ref>\n\nRussell said Vestron wanted an American name and suggested Catherine Oxenberg, who had been in ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Russell agreed although he said Oxenberg refused to be naked in the final sacrifice sequence, insisting on doing it in her underwear. Russell later wrote \"being of royal lineage, she opted for [[Harrods]]' silk but as we were a low budget movie she had to be content with [[Marks and Spencer]]'s cotton - and very fetching she was too.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ken|last=Russell|page=295|title=Altered States|year=1991|publisher=Bantam Books}}</ref>\n\nIt was one of Hugh Grant's first movies and Ireland says Grant was \"embarrassed by it\" in later years.<ref name=\"hell\"/> \"I'm not sure if it was meant to be horrific or funny,\" Grant said shortly after the film was made. \"When I saw it, I roared with laughter. As ever, I get to play a sort of upper-class young man. I have some exciting things to do: I get to slay a giant worm with a big sword, cutting it in half.
