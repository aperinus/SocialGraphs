Her new boyfriend Richard tricks her into working as a [[drug mule]] for a South Korean ''[[kkangpae]]'' and drug lord, and she delivers a briefcase containing four packets of the highly valuable synthetic drug CPH4 to Mr. Jang.\n\nAfter witnessing Richard being  shot and killed, she is captured and a bag of the drug is forcibly sewn into her abdomen in order to transport the drug to [[Europe]]. While in captivity, she is kicked in the stomach, breaking the bag and releasing a large quantity of the drug into her system. She acquires increasingly enhanced physical and mental capabilities, such as [[telepathy]], [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|mental time travel]], and the ability to feel no pain. She also becomes both ruthless and emotionless. Using her new abilities, she kills her captors and escapes.\n\nLucy travels to the nearby [[Tri-Service General Hospital]] to get the bag of drugs removed from her abdomen. She is told by the operating doctor that natural CPH4 is produced in tiny quantities by pregnant women during their sixth week of pregnancy to [[prenatal development|provide fetuses with the energy to develop]]. Growing heightened physical and mental abilities, Lucy returns to Mr. Jang's hotel, kills his bodyguards, assaults him, and telepathically extracts the locations of the three remaining drug mules from his brain.\n\nLucy begins researching her condition and contacts scientist Samuel Norman whose research may be the key to saving her. After Lucy speaks with Norman (and provides proof of her developed abilities) she flies to Paris and contacts local [[police captain]] Pierre Del Rio to help her find the remaining three packets of the drug. During the flight, she starts to disintegrate as her cells destabilize from consuming a sip of champagne. To stave off her disintegration Lucy ingests more of the drug. With the help of Del Rio, Lucy is able to recover the rest of the drugs. Meeting Norman and his colleagues, she agrees to share with them everything she knows.\n\nIn the professor's lab, Lucy discusses the nature of time and life and how people's humanity distorts their perceptions. At her urging, she is intravenously injected with the contents of all three remaining bags of CPH4. Her body changes into a black substance that begins spreading over computers and other electronic objects in the lab, transforming them all into one next-generation [[supercomputer]]. She mentally begins a spacetime journey into the past, eventually reaching the oldest discovered ancestor of mankind, [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]. She shares a quiet moment with ''australopithecus Lucy'' and the two touch fingertips, she then goes all the way to the beginning of time and witnesses the [[Big Bang]]. Meanwhile, Jang enters the lab and points a gun at Lucy's head. He shoots, but by that point Lucy has reached 100% of her brain capacity and promptly disappears, moving into the [[spacetime continuum]]. Only her clothes and the black supercomputer are left behind.\n\nDel Rio enters and fatally shoots Jang. Norman takes a black flash drive offered by the supercomputer, after which it too disintegrates. Del Rio asks Norman where Lucy is, immediately after which Del Rio's cell phone sounds and he sees a text message: \"I am everywhere.\" Lucy's voice is heard stating \"Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Lucy Miller: <br /> An unwilling drug mule who is accidentally dosed with a drug that activates a myriad of pre-encoded genetic conscious capabilities. The role of Lucy called for \"an actress who could be believable as extremely vulnerable, as well as superpowered, when her exposure to an illicit substance inadvertently makes her acquire incredible skills.\" Impressed by Johansson's discipline, Besson considered her for the role, stating that she was immediately precise and professional, and he \"enjoyed the way she talked about the film.\" He said, \"She was excited for the right reason, which was the story. At that moment, it was a done deal for me. She was definitely the one.\"<ref name=\"Production notes\">{{cite web|title=Lucy Production Notes|work=[[Universal Pictures]]|access-date=11 August 2014|url=http://www.lucymovie.com/pdf/lucy_production_notes.pdf}}</ref> [[Angelina Jolie]] is widely reported to have been originally cast as Lucy,<ref name=\"Foundas\">{{cite web|last=Foundas|first=Scott|title=Luc Besson Puts His EuropaCorp to the Test With 'Lucy'|work=Variety|date=5 August 2014|access-date=21 August 2014|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/luc-besson-lucy-europacorp-1201267055/}}</ref><ref name=\"Carson\">{{cite web|last=Carson|first=Tom|title=Lucy Gives Scarlett Johansson a Role She Can Kill: Genetic Freak|work=GQ|date=25 July 2014|access-date=26 July 2014|url=https://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/07/lucy-gives-scarlett-johansson-a-role-she-can-kill-genetic-freak.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Corliss\">{{cite magazine|last=Corliss|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Corliss|title=I Love Lucy \u2014 and Luc, and Scarlett|magazine=Time|date=25 July 2014|access-date=8 September 2014|url=http://time.com/3029819/lucy-movie-review-luc-besson/}}</ref> and as having dropped out of the role prior to filming.<ref name=\"Serba\">{{cite web|last=Serba|first=John|title='Lucy' movie review: Scarlett Johannson strong but sci-fi is weak in silly thriller|work=[[mlive.com]]|date=25 July 2014|access-date=26 July 2014|url=http://www.mlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2014/07/lucy_movie_review_scarlett_joh.html}}</ref> Although Jolie was in \"serious talks\" with Besson since 2011 to star in his next directorial effort, then untitled,<ref name=\"Armitage\">{{cite web|last=Armitage|first=Hugh|title=Angelina Jolie in talks for Luc Besson dramatic thriller|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=7 December 2011|access-date=22 August 2014|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a354749/angelina-jolie-in-talks-for-luc-besson-dramatic-thriller.html#~oNFvN6zQh2LFfE}}</ref><ref name=\"Lyons\">{{cite web|last=Lyons|first=Margaret|title=Angelina Jolie in Talks for Luc Besson's Next Movie|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]/vulture.com|date=12 June 2011|access-date=22 August 2014|url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/12/angelina-jolie-luc-besson.html}}</ref> he stated that she was not his first choice for the role of Lucy.<ref name=\"Foundas\"/>\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Professor Samuel Norman: <br /> Producer [[Virginie Silla]] stated that given Freeman's experience portraying a character of wisdom, \"it was pretty obvious that he was the perfect actor\" for the role of Professor Norman.<ref name=\"Production notes\"/>\n* [[Choi Min-sik]] as Mr. Jang: <br /> Besson said that Mr. Jang is the \"best villain\" he scripted since [[Gary Oldman]]'s character [[Norman Stansfield]], adding that \"Whereas Lucy is the ultimate intelligence, Mr. Jang is the ultimate devil.\" Besson and his film team \"had to go and meet [Choi] in Korea, talk with him and discuss the story.
