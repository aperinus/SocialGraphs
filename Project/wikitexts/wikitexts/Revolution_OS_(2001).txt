T. S. Moore, the film features interviews with prominent [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]] and [[entrepreneurs]] including [[Richard Stallman]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Linus Torvalds]], [[Larry Augustin]], [[Eric S. Raymond]], [[Bruce Perens]], Frank Hecker and [[Brian Behlendorf]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film begins with glimpses of Raymond, a Linux [[Initial public offering|IPO]], Torvalds, the idea of Open Source, Perens, Stallman, then sets the historical stage in the early days of hackers and computer hobbyists when code was shared freely. It discusses how change came in 1978 as Microsoft co-founder [[Bill Gates]], in his [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]], pointedly prodded hobbyists to pay up. Stallman relates his struggles with proprietary software vendors at the [[MIT]] Artificial Intelligence Lab, leading to his departure to focus on the development of [[free software]], and the [[GNU Project]].\n\nTorvalds describes the development of the [[Linux kernel]], the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]], Linux's further evolution, and its commercialization.\n\nRaymond and Stallman clarify the philosophy of free software versus [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], as well as the development stages of Linux.\n\nMichael Tiemann discusses meeting Stallman in 1987, getting an early version of Stallman's [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], and founding [[Cygnus Solutions]].\n\nLarry Augustin describes combining [[GNU]] software with a normal [[personal computer|PC]] to create a [[Unix-like]] [[workstation]] at one third the price and twice the power of a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstation. He relates his early dealings with [[venture capitalists]], the eventual capitalization and commodification of Linux for his own company, [[VA Linux]], and its [[Initial public offering|IPO]].\n\nBrian Behlendorf, one of the original developers of the [[Apache HTTP Server]], explains that he started to exchange [[Patch (computing)|patches]] for the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]] web server daemon [[NCSA HTTPd|HTTPd]] with other developers, which led to the release of \"a patchy\" web server, dubbed Apache.\n\nFrank Hecker of [[Netscape]] discusses the events leading up to Netscape's [[corporate officer|executives]] releasing the source code for Netscape's browser, one of the signal events which made [[Open-source model|open source]] a force to be reckoned with by business executives, the mainstream media, and the public at large.<ref>[http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec1May.html Community Articles: Interview: Frank Hecker] Openoffice.org. Louis Su\u00e1rez-Potts, May 1, 2001. Retrieved 2007-04-22.</ref> This point was validated further after the film's release as the Netscape source code eventually became the [[Firefox]] web browser, reclaiming a large percentage of market share from Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]].\n\nThe film also documents the scope of the first full-scale [[LinuxWorld Summit]] conference, with appearances by Linus Torvalds and Larry Augustin on the keynote stage.\n\nMuch of the footage for the film was shot in [[Silicon Valley]].\n\n== Screenings ==\nThe film appeared in several film festivals including [[South by Southwest]], the [[Atlanta Film and Video Festival]], [[Boston Film Festival]], and [[Denver International Film Festival]]; it won Best Documentary at both the [[Savannah Film and Video Festival]] and the [[Kudzu Film Festival]].\n\n== Quotes ==\n{{Copy to Wikiquote|section=yes}}\n{{blockquote|I bumped into him ([[Craig Mundie]] of Microsoft) in an elevator. I looked at his badge and said, \"Ah, I see you work for Microsoft.\"<br>\nHe looked back at me and said, \u201cOh yeah, and what do you do?\u201d<br>\nAnd I thought he seemed just some sort of a tad dismissive, I mean here is the archetypal guy in a suit looking at a scruffy hacker.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I gave him the [[thousand yard stare]] and said, \"I'm your worst nightmare.\"|[[Eric S.

Now, if you're like just a guy on the net who's not doing this for a job at all and you sort of write a manifesto and it spreads out through the world, and a year later the Vice President of [[Microsoft]] is talking about that, you'd think you were on drugs, wouldn't you?

Ron Wells of ''[[Film Threat]]''  found the film important, worthwhile, and well thought out for explaining the principles of the free software and open source concepts.  Noting its failure to represent on camera any debate with representatives of the proprietary software camp, Wells gave the film 4 of 5 stars.<ref>[https://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=1820 Revolution OS] ''[[Film Threat]]''.

Linux itself and its benefits are notably missing, and, \"[w]e are never shown anyone using Linux, except for unhappy users at an [[Installfest]].\" The debate over Linux VS Windows is missing, showing the origin of the OS only as a response to proprietary and expensive [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] software and hardware, and its growth solely due to the Apache web server. And Lord notes that the film shows, but does not challenge Torvalds or Stallman about their equally disingenuous remarks about the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|\"Linux\" vs \"GNU/Linux\" naming issue]].<ref>[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/04/19/1255213 Revolution OS Review] ''Slashdot.org.''
