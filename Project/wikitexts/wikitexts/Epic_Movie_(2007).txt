It stars [[Kal Penn]], [[Adam Campbell (actor)|Adam Campbell]], [[Jayma Mays]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Faune A. Chambers]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], and [[Fred Willard]]. A parody of the [[epic film]] genre, the film mostly references ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']], ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', and ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''.\n\nThe film was released on January 19, 2007, and it was unanimously panned by critics, and many have considered this to be [[List of films considered the worst#Epic Movie (2007)|one of the worst films of all time]]. Despite this, however, it was a moderate box office success, reaching $86.9 million against its $20 million. The song \"[[Ms. New Booty]]\" by [[Bubba Sparxxx]] gained commercial attention for being featured in ''Epic Movie''.\n\n==Plot==\nLucy finds that her adoptive father, a [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|museum curator, has been attacked by Silas]]. Before dying, he gives clues that lead her to a \"Golden Ticket\" in a [[vending machine]] [[candy bar]]. During \"comedic\" situations, fellow [[Nacho Libre|orphans]] Edward, a disillusioned [[monk]] trainee; Susan, a [[Snakes on a Plane|displaced]] adopted girl; and Peter, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] at Mutant Academy who is often teased for his [[chicken]]-like wings, all find Golden Tickets. All four meet up at [[Willy Wonka|Willy's]] [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Chocolate Factory]]. Willy reveals his plot to use them all as a special ingredient in his treats.\n\nAttempting to hide from the maniacal Willy, Lucy finds [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|a wardrobe]]. On the other side, in the middle of a wintry [[forest]], she finds [[Mr. Tumnus]], who welcomes Lucy to Gnarnia and warns her of danger. The others follow Lucy to Gnarnia, and Edward meets the [[White Witch|White Bitch]]. She convinces him to trap the other orphans in order to become the king of Gnarnia in her [[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle|White Castle]].\n\nAll four go to Tumnus' house, where they discover their relation to each other [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|in a copy of the famous painting ''The Last Supper'']], and that the White Bitch killed their parents. They ally themselves with Harry Beaver, Tumnus' life partner, to defeat the White Bitch.\n\nEdward sneaks off to the White Bitch's [[castle]]. When he refuses to reveal to her where the others are, she [[Exhibitionism|flashes]] him her breasts, hypnotizing him into giving up the information on the orphans, then imprisons him. The White Bitch sends Silas after the trio; Tumnus apparently sacrifices himself to ensure their safety.\n\nAfterwards, the orphans meet a graying [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], along with a balding [[Ron Weasley]] and a pregnant [[Hermione Granger]] at [[Hogwarts]]. They all help Lucy, Susan, and Peter train for the war against the White Bitch.\n\n[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Captain Jack Swallows]] helps Edward escape, only for Edward to find out it was a ruse as Jack, the Bitch's old enemy, needs intelligence out of Edward.\n\nUpon finishing their training, Lucy, Susan, and Peter head to the camp of [[Aslan|Aslo]]. Aslo agrees to help Edward and manages to kill Silas, but while breaking Edward out, he is slain by the White Bitch. As the orphans have a pre-battle party with their allies, Susan gets drunk and vomits everywhere, disgusting their army enough that nobody shows up to help the orphans the next day. The four siblings engage the White Bitch in battle and are killed. Peter then finds [[Click (2006 film)|a magic remote]] and uses its powers to revive his siblings.\n\nTogether, they kill the army, defeat the White Bitch, and stop her plan. Peter declares the White Bitch will receive a fair and just trial in the new Gnarnia, but Jack's wheel accidentally crushes her to death. The four are crowned the new rulers of the land. Tumnus then shows up, having survived his battle. Decades later, the four now-elderly rulers find the wardrobe again and go through it. They appear moments after they had left, young again. They meet [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]], who congratulates them on a happy ending, but then, Jack's wheel accidentally runs over the quartet, killing them. Borat then says his iconic \"NOT!\" before turning around and clapping his buttocks, ending the film.\n\n===Extended version===\nThe unrated, longer version (released in the United Kingdom as the \"Rude & Crude Unseen Version\") of the film features some scenes not shown in the theatrical version. In an alternate ending, Willy Wonka, instead of Borat, comes in and says: \"I told you it was going to be an epic adventure.\" Willy Wonka then goes in the wardrobe and puts out a [[Do not disturb sign|\"do not disturb\" sign]] that refers to the girl in the wardrobe. The [[Oompa-Loompa]]s come in and start singing a parody version of the Willy Wonka theme song. The four are then crushed by the wheel. Also, during the scene where Lucy is crushed under the junk that falls out of the wardrobe, the girl who runs out is nude, as opposed to wearing a bikini. In the ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' scene, when the Samuel L. Jackson lookalike yells, he replaces \"goddamn\" with \"motherfuckin'\".\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\" sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
