The Traags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Traags to [[Population control|control their population]]. Traags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less.\n\nWhen an Om mother is tortured to death by three Traag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Traag leader, and his daughter Tiwa, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiwa loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, gives him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using a headset that transmits knowledge into her mind; a defect in Terr's collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiwa grows into her teens and first performs Traag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Traag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiwa's headset.\n\nThere he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Traag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headset to acquire Traag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Traag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Traag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Traag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Traag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Traag leaders.\n\nThey live there for years, joined by many other Oms. Due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headset, they manage to replicate Traag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Traags. When a large-scale Traag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Traags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange mating ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Traags' existence; the genocide of Oms is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Traags negotiate for peace. The Oms agree to leave the Fantastic Planet to the Traags for their meditations, and in return, an artificial satellite is put into orbit around Ygam and given to the Oms as a new home. This leads to an era of peaceful coexistence between the two species, who now benefit from each other's way of thinking.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!French\n!English\n|-\n!Tiwa\n|Jennifer Drake\n|Cynthia Adler\n|-\n!Young Terr\n|Eric Baugin\n|[[Mark Gruner]]\n|-\n!Master Sinh\n|[[Jean Topart]]\n|[[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]]\n|-\n!Adult Terr (Narrator)\n|Jean Valmont\n|[[Barry Bostwick]]\n|-\n!Om\n|[[Yves Barsacq]]\n|[[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] (old and sorcerer)\n|-\n!Master Taj\n|[[G\u00e9rard Hernandez]]\n|[[Olan Soule]]\n|-\n!Great Tree Chief\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Unknown\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]]\n|-\n!Master Kon\n|-\n!Hollow Log Chief\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Janet Waldo]]\n|-\n!Traag Child\n|Mark Lesser\n|-\n!Traag\n|Denis Boileau\n|Unknown\n|}\n\n===Additional voices===\n*French: Sylvie Lenoir, Mich\u00e8le Chahan, Hubert de Lapparent, Claude Joseph, Philippe Ogouz, Jacques Ruisseau, Max Amyl, Madeleine Clervannes, William Coryn, Poupy de Monneron, Christian de Tilli\u00e8re, Christian Echelard, Jeanine Forney, Pascal Kominakis, Andre Lambert, Serge Netter, Yvette Robin, Andr\u00e9 Rouyer, Irina Tarason, Julien Thomas, Gilbert Vilhon, Paul Vill\u00e9\n*English: Nora Heflin, Monika Ramirez\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = La Plan\u00e8te Sauvage\n| type         = [[Film score]]\n| artist       = [[Alain Goraguer]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|1973}}\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{hlist|[[Psychedelic music|Psychedelic]]|[[jazz]]|[[funk]]}}\n| length       = 38:53\n| label        = [[DC Recordings]]\n| producer     = \n}}\n\nThe film's score was composed by [[Alain Goraguer]].
