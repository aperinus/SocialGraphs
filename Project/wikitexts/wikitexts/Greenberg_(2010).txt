The film stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Greta Gerwig]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Brie Larson]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. ''Greenberg'' was produced by Scott Rudin Productions and distributed by [[Focus Features]]. The film's [[Greenberg (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] features the first film score by [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]].\n\nAlthough the film received positive reviews, it was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $7 million against a $25 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nFlorence Marr is a personal assistant to the Greenberg family in [[Hollywood Hills]]. Before the family leaves on a trip to [[Vietnam]], Phillip Greenberg explains his brother, Roger will be staying at the house, ostensibly to build a doghouse for their pet, Mahler. Phillip's wife, Carol confides that Roger has just been released from a hospital after a nervous breakdown.\n\nArriving from [[New York City]], Roger has an awkward encounter with Florence, and spends his time building the doghouse, watching neighbors swim in the Greenbergs\u2019 pool, and writing various letters of complaint. His friend Ivan Schrank invites him to a party at the home of their former bandmate Eric Beller, where Roger is uncomfortable and Eric is openly hostile. Roger runs into Beth, an ex-girlfriend, explaining he is in [[Los Angeles]] to simply do nothing for a while.\n\nRoger calls Florence to meet for a drink. He does not drive so she picks him up, stopping at her apartment for her purse. They begin to have sex, but Florence stops him, having just come out of a long relationship and not wanting to have meaningless sex. Roger suggests they keep things platonic and she agrees, but they remain drawn to each other.\n\nOver dinner, Eric vents that Roger declined a major record deal for their band fifteen years ago. He marvels that Ivan, devastated by losing the contract, still speaks to him.\n\nNoticing Mahler is lethargic, Roger calls Florence to take them to a vet, where they learn he has an [[auto-immune disease]]. Their relationship soon escalates, with Florence falling for Roger despite his outbursts and awkwardness.\n\nRoger meets Beth for drinks and recalls minute details from their time together, which she barely remembers; she leaves abruptly when Roger tries to rekindle their relationship.\n\nAfter Florence and Roger finally have sex, he yells at her for pursuing him when he does not want to become involved. The next day, a remorseful Roger calls Florence, who confesses that she is due to have an abortion the following day. Roger offers to take her; since he does not drive, Ivan drives them to the clinic, where she undergoes [[general anaesthesia]] and stays overnight.\n\nBack at the house, Roger's college-age niece, Sara has turned up. Leaving for Australia in the morning with her friend, Muriel, they throw a house party with dozens of their friends, with whom Roger does drugs. Ivan arrives and gets into an argument with Roger, finally voicing his feelings over their lost record deal. Roger confesses he had no idea his personal concerns would end the band, for which he feels immense guilt. They bemoan that they have ended up in lives they did not plan to have, though Ivan has made peace with his. Having learned from Florence that Roger had been hospitalized, and having been through a similar experience himself, Ivan laments that they could have helped each other. He leaves, declaring that they never truly talk, and saddened Roger never made an effort to know Ivan's son. Dejected and inebriated, Roger leaves a long voicemail for Florence, confessing that he really likes her.\n\nThe next day, Roger jumps at Sara's invitation to accompany her to Australia. He convinces the neighbors to take care of Mahler, but on the way to the airport, changes his mind. Instead, he goes to meet Florence at the clinic, and they return to her apartment. The film closes as she listens to Roger's voicemail.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Roger Greenberg\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Florence Marr\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Ivan Schrank\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Beth\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Gina\n* [[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]] as Phillip Greenberg, Roger's brother\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Sara\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Muriel\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Eric Beller\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Rich\n* [[Jake Paltrow]] as Johno\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[Image:James Murphy at 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.jpg|thumb|\"Sounds nothing like LCD, really, which cracks us [Baumbach and him] both up.\"\u2014[[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4138468-lcd-soundsystem--10-questions-for-2010|title=LCD Soundsystem: 10 Questions for 2010|work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|last=Adams|first=Sean|date=November 24, 2009|access-date=February 11, 2010|archive-date=November 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126185626/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4138468-lcd-soundsystem--10-questions-for-2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe soundtrack is arranged by [[DFA Records]] co-founder [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]].
