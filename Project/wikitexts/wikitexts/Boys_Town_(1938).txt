He is visited by an old friend, [[Edward J. Flanagan|Father Flanagan]] ([[Spencer Tracy]]) who runs a home for indigent men in Omaha, Nebraska. When the prison officials suggest that the condemned man owes the state a debt, Father Flanagan witnesses the condemned man's diatribe to prison officials and a reporter that describes his awful plight as a homeless and friendless boy who was a ward in state institutions. After the convicted man asks the officials to leave, Father Flanagan provides some comfort and wisdom. On the train back to Omaha, Father Flanagan is transformed in his humanitarian mission by revelations (echoed in the words) imparted by the condemned man's litany of hardships suffered as a child, without friends or family, and a ward of the state.\n\nFather Flanagan believes there is no such thing as a bad boy and spends his life attempting to prove it. He battles indifference, the legal system, and often even the boys, to build a sanctuary that he calls Boys Town. The boys have their own government, make their own rules, and dish out their own punishment. One boy, Whitey Marsh ([[Mickey Rooney]]), is as much as anyone can handle. Whitey's elder brother Joe, in prison for murder, asks Father Flanagan to take Whitey\u2014a poolroom shark and tough talking hoodlum\u2014to Boys Town. Joe escapes custody during transfer to federal prison.  Whitey stays, though, and runs for mayor of Boys Town, determined to win with his \"don't be a sucker\" campaign slogan.\n\nWinning the election for mayor is Tony Ponessa ([[Gene Reynolds]]), a disabled boy. Whitey has an  outburst after finding out the results. This nearly causes a fistfight between Whitey and outgoing mayor Freddie Fuller ([[Frankie Thomas]]). Since Whitey's arrival at Boys Town, him and Freddie did not get along too well. To settle their differences once and for all, a boxing match is held. Freddie defeats Whitey with Father Flanagan and all of the boys watching.\n\nWhitey leaves Boys Town after getting defeated in the boxing match. Pee Wee ([[Bobs Watson]]), the Boys Town mascot, catches up with him and pulls on his sleeve, pleading, \"We're going to be pals, ain't we?\" Whitey, nearly in tears, refuses and pushes the child to the ground and tells him to go back. He storms across the highway and Pee Wee follows him. Pee Wee is suddenly hit by a car; Whitey leaves, feeling guilty and hurt. During an aimless walk in downtown Omaha, Whitey runs into his brother Joe, who mistakenly shoots him in the leg. Joe takes Whitey to a church and calls Flanagan anonymously, after which Whitey is taken back to Boys Town. The sheriff comes to get Whitey, but Flanagan offers to take full responsibility for the boy.\n\nWhitey refuses to tell Flanagan about the robbery, because he has promised Joe not to inform on him. But when he realizes that his silence could result in the end of Boys Town, he goes to Joe's hideout. Joe, realizing with Whitey that Boys Town is more important than they, releases his brother from his promise. Joe protects him until Flanagan and some boys arrive at their hideout. The criminals are recaptured and Boys Town's reward is a flood of donations. Whitey is elected the new mayor of Boys Town by acclamation and Dave{{clarify|date=February 2020}} resigns himself to go into more debt as Flanagan tells him of his new ideas for expanding the facility.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as [[Edward J.
