Campion's screenplay is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the [[In the Cut|1995 novel of the same name]] by [[Susanna Moore]]. The film focuses on an English teacher who becomes personally entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her [[Manhattan]] neighborhood.\n\nThe film received a [[limited release]] on October 22, 2003, in the United States, and was subsequently given a [[wide release]] on [[Halloween]] that year in the United States and United Kingdom. The film received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Negative reviews were critical of the story and narrative structure,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=Hornaday |first=Ann |author-link=Ann Hornaday |date=31 October 2003 |title='In the Cut': Provocatively Predictable |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/10/31/in-the-cut-provocatively-predictable/02fa9b38-d9ae-4e3a-84fc-66fb7d3738bc/ |url-status=live |archive-date= |access-date=December 3, 2021 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> while positive reviews praised the acting and Campion's visuals.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |author-link=Manohla Dargis |date=22 October 2003 |title=Hot and cold |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-oct-22-et-dargis22-story.html |access-date=December 3, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the film has undergone a reappraisal for its subversion of the [[male gaze]] and other common movie tropes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Justine |date=30 April 2018 |title=Re-examining the challenging eroticism of In the Cut |url=https://lwlies.com/articles/in-the-cut-jane-campion-erotic-thriller/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 3, 2021 |website=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]]}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |last=Richard |first=David Evan |date=September 2017 |title=In the Cut (Jane Campion, 2003) |url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2017/cteq/in-the-cut/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 3, 2021 |website=[[Senses of Cinema]]}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web |last=Vasquez |first=Zach |date=17 November 2021 |title=IN THE CUT: A Secret American Giallo Masterpiece |url=https://www.fangoria.com/original/in-the-cut-a-secret-american-giallo-masterpiece/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 3, 2021 |website=[[Fangoria]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFrannie Avery, an introverted writer and English teacher in [[New York City]], meets one of her students, Cornelius, at a local pub to talk about coursework. Cornelius proposes a theory that [[John Wayne Gacy]] may not have been guilty of his crimes, later suggesting that 'desire' was responsible. On her way to the basement bathroom, she witnesses a woman performing [[oral sex]] on a man. Though it's dark, she can see a 3 of [[Spades (suit)|spade]]s tattoo on the man's wrist and the woman's blue fingernails.\n\nPeriodically, Frannie reads poems on subway posters that seem to have bearing on her own life.\n\nSeveral days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions Frannie as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman whose severed limb was found in Frannie's garden. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows disillusioned with the sexist attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez, who can no longer carry a gun because he tried to kill his wife. Frannie questions Malloy about his 3 of spades tattoo, which he says identifies him as a member of a secret club. While walking home from a bar, she is assaulted by a masked stranger. She phones Malloy, and the two have passionate sex.  She realizes a charm is missing from her bracelet.\n\nThe next day, Frannie describes the sexual encounter to her free-spirited half-sister, Pauline, who lives above a [[strip club]]. After Malloy tells Frannie that she and the murder victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, she begins to suspect that Malloy may be the killer. A second victim is found dismembered in a washing machine at a school laundry. Frannie accompanies Malloy to a secluded spot along a river, where he teaches her to use a gun. Meanwhile, Cornelius has been taken in for police questioning on suspicion of the murders because his term paper on John Wayne Gacy is illustrated with blood.\n\nFrannie is confronted by her former boyfriend, John, who tells her he has been having panic attacks. She goes to Pauline's apartment, which she finds unlocked and in disarray. In the bathroom, she finds Pauline's severed head in a plastic bag. After being questioned by Malloy, Frannie gets drunk in her apartment. Cornelius arrives and attempts to rape her, but is interrupted by Detective Rodriguez. Later, Malloy reveals that the killer's 'signature' is leaving a ring on the finger of his victims. Frannie handcuffs him to a pipe, and they have sex. After discovering that Malloy has her missing charm and a key to Pauline's apartment, she confronts him about his tattoo and suggests that he is the [[serial killer]]. She takes Malloy's jacket and gun, leaving him handcuffed, and is met by Rodriguez outside. He persuades her to get into his unmarked police car.\n\nRodriguez drives Frannie to the [[Little Red Lighthouse]] below the [[George Washington Bridge]]. She tells him that it reminds her of a book she teaches, ''[[To the Lighthouse]]''. Frannie notices Rodriguez has the same tattoo as Malloy. Rodriguez presents a ring on the end of a knife and asks Frannie to marry him. Realizing that Rodriguez is the killer, Frannie shoots him with Malloy's gun. He attempts to strangle her, but she fires the gun again, killing him. Bloodied, she walks back to her apartment and lies down with Malloy, who is still cuffed to the pipe where she left him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Frannie Avery\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Detective Giovanni A.

With its restless, jittery camera, the movie captures the jangly paranoia of a city that is often equally tantalizing and threatening; Frannie responds in kind, with her own contradictory sexual persona, which at certain times is defiantly autonomous and at others almost timidly girlish. A ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' for the [[post-9/11]] age (the remnants of that tragedy form one of the movie's many visual leitmotifs), ''In the Cut'' focuses on the darker face of the classic New York romance. It's a face that's grimly credible, if seldom seen. Within an otherwise flawed, forgettable movie, Campion has managed to offer a vivid, if fleeting, glimpse of the wariness, self-deception and fear that shadow so many illicit thrills of sex in the city.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>Hornaday also singled out Ruffalo's performance, writing the actor is \u201cunsettlingly convincing as a man whose sexual magnetism lies not in leading-man good looks but in his ability to portray himself as both a protector and, if the situation warrants, a predator\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" />\n''In the Cut'' was among the films discussed favorably by [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] in ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/shelf-life-13/ |title=Shelf Life: Jane Campion reconsidered. |last=Gottlieb |first=Akiva |publisher=The Nation |date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''Retrospective'''\n\nIn the years since ''In the Cut''<nowiki/>'s original release, the film has been reexamined and praised as a [[Feminism|feminist]] [[erotic thriller]].
