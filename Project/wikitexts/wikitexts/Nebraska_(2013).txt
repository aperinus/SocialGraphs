The film was acclaimed by critics and became a commercial success, bringing in $27.7 million from the box office on a $13.5 million budget. It was the final film to be released by [[Paramount Vantage]], as it merged with its parent company [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Billings, Montana]], a police officer discovers Woody Grant walking dangerously on the shoulder of the roadway and takes him to the local police station. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money.\n\nAfter Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. Ross is especially frustrated because their Dad didn't put any effort into parenting them and used to drink a lot. He doesn't feel they 'owe' their father anything.\n\nDavid is visited by his ex-girlfriend, Noelle, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay and anger.\n\nWhile in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], Woody goes on a [[Binge drinking|bender]] and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. The doctor wants to observe Woody for a day and when he hears about Woody's 'win' he says that'll cover the hospital fees. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway.\n\nThey stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife Martha, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some drinks at a bar. Woody pressures David into having a beer. When David was six his Dad had let him drink beer thinking it harmless. David brings up Woody's [[alcoholism]] and problems within the family \u2014 with Woody implying that he fell into marriage and did not discuss having children with Kate; he just liked 'screwing' \u2014 they get into an argument.\n\nAt another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's [[air compressor]] decades ago. But Woody previously said he had sold the garage to Ed. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.\n\nKate arrives by bus in Hawthorne, where David escorts his parents to the cemetery. Kate pays her respects there while providing some colorful history on Woody's relatives, particularly their sex lives. A local newspaper owner wants to run a story about Woody and his sweepstakes \"victory.\" She is an old girlfriend of Woody's and provides David with some background about his father. That night, Ed corners David in the men's room about some money Ed loaned Woody years ago that he wants back, threatening legal action.\n\nThe rest of Woody's family, including Ross, come to visit him. Cole and Bart, along with others, approach David and Ross about their share of the money that they believe Woody owes them. A fight begins, ending abruptly with Kate calling out the relatives for their own unpaid debts. David, Kate, Ross and Woody tour the latter's childhood home, which has fallen into disrepair. They drive past a house Kate identifies as Ed's, so David and Ross conspire to steal back the air compressor. Kate soon realizes that the house actually belongs to another couple. She distracts the homeowners so David and Ross can quickly return the stolen compressor.\n\nAt the bar, asking Woody for money, Ed reveals that Woody cheated on Kate before David's birth. As they leave, they are attacked by a masked Bart and Cole, who escape with the sweepstakes letter. They later tell David they threw it away after finding out it was a scam. Nevertheless, David and Woody go searching for it. They enter a bar where they find Ed reading the letter aloud to the other patrons, humiliating Woody. After Woody takes the letter back and goes outside, David punches Ed in the face.\n\nWoody has repeatedly said he wants to buy a truck with the money. He cannot drive any more, but Woody tells his son that he also wants to leave something for his family when he dies. David says that they are not going to Lincoln, at which point Woody collapses. David takes him to the hospital in [[Norfolk, Nebraska|Norfolk]]. In the middle of the night, Woody abruptly leaves and starts walking, so David relents and drives Woody to Lincoln.\n\nThey arrive at the marketing agency, where they are told that Woody did not have the winning number. He is given a consolation gift of a hat that reads \"Prize Winner\". David goes to an auto dealership and trades in his [[Subaru]] for a late-model truck that his father always wanted, along with a new [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]] air compressor. While driving back through Hawthorne, David hides below the dash and lets Woody take the wheel for all to see. Among them is Woody's former flame who smiles at him, a nonplussed Ed with a black eye, and Woody's brother Albert. Woody waves goodbye and drives out of town, then stops in the middle of the road and switches seats with David, who takes them the rest of the way back home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Woodrow T. \"Woody\" Grant, David and Ross' father, and Kate's husband\n* [[Will Forte]] as David Grant, Woody and Kate's youngest son, and Ross' brother\n* [[June Squibb]] as Kate Grant, Woody's wife, and Ross and David's mother\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Ross Grant, Woody and Kate's oldest son, David's brother and a local television news anchor\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Ed Pegram, Woody's former business partner\n* [[Mary Louise Wilson]] as Aunt Martha, Woody's sister-in-law\n* [[Angela McEwan]] as Peg Nagy, Woody's former girlfriend\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Uncle Ray, one of Woody's brothers\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Cole, Ray and Martha's son\n* Tim Driscoll as Bart, Ray and Martha's son\n* Melinda Simonsen as the Receptionist in Lincoln\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nWhile working on ''[[About Schmidt]]'', Payne received Nelson's screenplay from [[Albert Berger]] and [[Ron Yerxa]], asking him to recommend a director. He asked to direct it himself, but did not want to follow up one road trip film (''[[Sideways]]'', on which he was in pre-production) with another. He decided to wait until after completing ''[[The Descendants]]'' to begin work on the film. This was the first film of Payne's in which he was not directly involved in the writing process, and he rewrote only a few things prior to the beginning of filming.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodsell|first=Luke|title=Interview: Alexander Payne on ''Nebraska''|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nebraska/news/1928601/interview_alexander_payne_on_nebraska/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=October 10, 2013|date=October 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter first reading the script, Payne thought of [[Bruce Dern]] for the role of Woody Grant.
