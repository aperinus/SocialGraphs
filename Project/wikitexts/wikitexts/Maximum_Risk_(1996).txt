The film was released in the United States on September 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jean-Claude Van Damme|website= [[The A.V.

A cop, Alain Moreau, is brought by his partner Sebastien to the scene because the victim's face is identical to Alain's. Matches found in his pocket point towards a local hotel, where the proprietor mistakes Alain for \"Mikhail Suverov\" and gives him the phone message \"Call Alex Bohemia.\" In Mikhail's room is a passport with the same birth date as Alain, and a plane ticket to New York. Alain's mother admits that Alain has a twin brother who she had to give up at birth because she was impoverished. Alain and Sebastian visit the office of the lawyer who adopted Mikhail. They find the room in flames and a large Russian man attacks Alain. Alain escapes with the adoption file, which reveals Mikhail was adopted by a Russian family who immigrated to America. Alain takes the passport and plane ticket to New York to investigate his brother's death and learn more about him.\n\nIn New York City, Alain discovers that Mikhail was a member of the [[Russian Mafia]]. When he mentions Alex Bohemia, he is referred to the Bohemia Club in [[Brighton Beach|Little Odessa]]. There a woman named Alex Bartlett mistakes him for Mikhail and gives him a key to a hotel room. Wary, Alain rents the room across the hall. When Alex comes to meet him later, he reveals that he is Mikhail's brother. Ivan (who saw Mikhail in the club) and his thugs arrive to kill Alain, believing he is Mikhail. Alain and Alex escape. Alex tells him Mikhail was her boyfriend and he had a plan to leave the Russian Mafia. They go to Mikhail's home, where Alain finds out Mikhail discovered his existence when he saw an article in the paper about his war exploits. After more Russians come to the house, Alain and Alex flee to her friend's cabin.\n\nThe next morning, two FBI agents come to the cabin. They say Mikhail kept evidence against the Russian Mafia that he intended to turn over to them, wanting to reform. They want him to pose as Mikhail to access his safe deposit box back in Nice. In actuality, they want to destroy the evidence because it implicates them in colluding with the Russian Mafia. Realizing that the FBI and not the Mafia knew Mikhail was dead, Alain deduces that it was FBI agents who killed Mikhail, and refuses to cooperate. After a fight, Alain handcuffs the agents together and leaves with Alex to visit Kirov, the leader of the Russian Mafia. When he finds them at a [[banya (sauna)|banya]], Alain tells Kirov that Ivan has been trying to kill him, which enrages Kirov. After Kirov tells Alain the truth about the so-called evidence he has, Ivan sends the big Russian thug from the lawyer's office to kill Kirov and Alain. Kirov dies and Alain escapes in the scuffle; during the pursuit by Ivan, Alain is arrested by NYPD. The two corrupt FBI agents find Alex, bail Alain out of jail and use her to force Alain to access the deposit box.\n\nBank policy dictates that only Alain himself can access the safe deposit box, forcing the FBI agents to wait outside. In the box is the evidence, thousands in cash, a gun and a tape recording from Mikhail explaining how he decided to escape the mob life and reunite with his family. He instructs a banker to turn over the evidence to the US Embassy, and sets off the sprinkler system to make his escape. Ivan, waiting with Sebastien as his hostage, sends in the big Russian. The thug kills the banker and takes the evidence, but Alain catches up and kills him in the elevator. Outside, police officers block off Ivan's escape, giving Alain time to catch up, shoot out Ivan's tires, and rescue Sebastien; Ivan dies in the wreckage. Alain then chases the FBI agents into a meat locker where he shoots them both and rescues Alex. Mikhail's evidence of Mafia collusion with the FBI leads to several arrests. Alain takes Alex, with whom he is now romantically involved, to meet his mother so she can tell her about Mikhail.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Alain Moreau / Mikhail Suverov\n*[[Natasha Henstridge]] as Alex Bartlett\n*[[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as Sebastien\n*[[Zach Grenier]] as Ivan Dzasokhov\n*[[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Agent Pellman\n*Frank Senger as Agent Loomis\n*[[David Hemblen]] as Dmitri Kirov\n*Dan Moran as Yuri\n*Stefanos Miltsakakis as Red Face\n*[[St\u00e9phane Audran]] as Chantal Moreau\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally known as ''The Exchange'', then it was retitled ''Bloodstone''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hooray for Hong Kong!
