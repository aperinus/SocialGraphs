He frequents a night club, from which he conducts a superficial sexual relationship with Karen. At the same time he rejects Tia, deeming her a 'whore'.\n\nOne night crime boss \"Mr. Z\" and two goons come to the building looking for the money Amber's boyfriend stole from his organization. Having heard gunshots upstairs, Walt suffers a [[stroke]] while ascending the stairs to help. He awakens with the right side of his body [[paralyzed]] resulting in poor speech and posture, and giving him a limp that requires him to use a cane. Walter's ego massively suffers and he becomes ashamed to be seen in public, even skipping therapy, leading to his doctor visiting him at home. His physical therapist, who had been sent to Walt's home by the doctor, recommends a singing teacher to improve his speech. When Walt hails a taxi outside the building, he falls and drops the plan.\n\nRusty desires to have [[sex reassignment surgery]], but lacks the money. When Walter comes to Rusty to use his musical talents for singing lessons, the pair, while initially argumentative and uncomfortable with each other, slowly become friends. Walter begins to gain confidence and progress towards resuming a normal life, his speech showing considerable improvement. Meanwhile, after having been told by Rusty that everyone pays in a relationship, including husbands and boyfriends, Walt calls Karen. After she claims rent problems Walt lies that all his money went to therapy, after which she holds off on seeing him. Tia visits his apartment, and they dance and kiss. She leaves however, when Walt states his belief that his former colleague and friend Tommy must have hired her.\n\nWalt tells Rusty that a former colleague of him and Tommy abused his friendship by hitching a ride to the airport, after having stolen a fortune from their employer. Rusty responds with his own confession: He had taken Mr. Z's money after the police had vacated the building to pay for her surgery, meaning the singing lessons had been a front. Feeling used again, Walt leaves in anger. [[Building superintendent]] Leo, who had been threatened by Mr. Z., opens Rusty's medical bill, realizing he has the money. Walt goes back to the nightclub for the first time since his stroke and makes up with Tia. When he returns Leo tells him to ignore any sounds he might hear that night. The three criminals ambush Rusty in his apartment, and Walt goes upstairs again. Together Rusty and Walt manage to kill them. The wounded Walt is loaded into an ambulance, after which Rusty hands the paramedics the cash to get him the best care available. They renew their friendship and singing lessons.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Walter Koontz\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Rusty\n* [[Skipp Sudduth]] as Tommy\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Leonard Wilcox\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Jacko\n* [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]] as Cha-Cha\n* [[Nashom Wooden]] as Amazing Grace credited as Nashom Benjamin\n* [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Tia\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Pogo\n* Scott Allen Cooper as Ivana\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Detective Noonan\n* [[Mina Bern]] as Mrs. Spivak\n* [[Penny Balfour]] as Cristal\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] (''uncredited'') as Neighborhood boy\n* [[Richie Lamontagne]]  as Carmine the Pizza Boy\n* [[Luis Saguar]] as Mr. Z\n* [[Mitchell Lichtenstein]] as Gay Republican Spokesperson\n* [[John Enos]] as Sonny, Rusty's abusive boyfriend\n* [[Karina Arroyave]] as Amber\n* [[Wanda De Jesus]] as Karen\n* [[Madhur Jaffrey]] as dr.

Hoffman felt that his exposure to that level of acting profoundly improved his own abilities as an actor.<ref name=\"Buffalo900\">{{cite web|author=Simon, Jeff|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12941203.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071107/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12941203.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 June 2014|title=Role Player ; Rochester's Philip Seymour Hoffman on Hollywood, good films and the 'star' factor|publisher=The Buffalo News, accessed via HighBeam Research {{subscription}}|date=24 September 2000|access-date=19 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nReview-aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 41% approval rating based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10,<ref>{{cite web|title=Flawless|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flawless/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandango Media|access-date=9 February 2021}}</ref> and a consensus reading: \"Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman's ''Flawless'' performances live up to this dramedy's title; unfortunately, they're outweighed by the misguided picture surrounding them.\" Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of \"C\" on scale of A+ to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nHoffman was praised by critics for his ability to avoid clich\u00e9s in playing such a delicate role.<ref name=\"AVC\"/> Emily VanDerWerff, a transgender film critic, praised the warmth of his portrayal of Rusty, commenting that \"Hoffman\u2019s work is quiet, moving, and humanistic, and it provides the film with a core Schumacher doesn\u2019t remotely earn.
