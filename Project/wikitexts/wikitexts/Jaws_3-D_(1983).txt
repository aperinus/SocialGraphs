The film follows the Brody children from the previous films to [[SeaWorld Orlando|SeaWorld]], a Florida marine park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young [[great white shark]] infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a second, much larger shark also entered the park and was the real culprit.\n\nThe film made use of [[3D film|3D]] during the revived interest in the technology in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]''. Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard [[polarized 3D glasses]] to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen.<ref name=\"Ankeney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|title=Underwater with Hydroflex's Pete Romano|last=Ankeney|first=Jay|date=March 13, 2000|work=HydroFlex Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208200630/http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|archive-date=February 8, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=January 4, 2007}}</ref> Several shots and sequences were designed to utilize the effect, such as the shark's destruction.

Among the attractions are new underwater tunnels that allow for a view of the undersea life.  While the park's lagoon gates are stuck open, a [[great white shark]] follows an unsuspecting team of water skiers into the park. Kay and her assistants notice that the resident [[Bottlenose dolphin|dolphins]], especially two individuals Cindy and Sandy, are afraid of leaving their pen and going out into the lagoon. Later, Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, welcomes his friend, adventurer and hunter Philip FitzRoyce, and Mike's brother Sean arrives for a visit. That night, Shelby Overman, a mechanic, dives into the water to repair and secure the gates. He is attacked by the shark and killed, severing his right arm. Mike, Kay and Sean go out for drinks and Sean meets and begins dating Kelly Ann Bukowski, one of the park's water skiers. Meanwhile, two men sneak into the park and go underwater to steal [[coral]] they intend to [[Black Market|sell]], but both are killed by the shark in the process.\n\nThe next day, Kay and Mike are informed of Overman's disappearance. They go down in a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a juvenile great white, only {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but the shark escapes back into the park. They inform Bouchard, and FitzRoyce suggests killing the shark on network television. Kay protests, instead recommending capturing the shark and keeping it alive in captivity, which would generate more publicity for the park. The shark is successfully captured, and Kay and her staff begin to nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies. Kelly cajoles Sean out onto the water in a [[bumper boats|bumper boat]], despite his trepidation due to his experiences in Amity.\n\nOverman's corpse is discovered and, reviewing the body, Kay realizes that the shark that killed him is the first shark's {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on}} long mother and that it must also be inside the park. She is able to convince Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself shows up at the window of the underwater caf\u00e9. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injuring Kelly, and causing a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack Tate, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap to kill it. As Jack closes the pipe's gate, FitzRoyce successfully leads the shark into the pipe, but his tether rope suddenly snaps due to the strong current generated by its pumps. Trapped inside the pipe and unable to reach the ladder to the exit hatch, he decides to kill the shark with a [[Powerhead (firearm)|bang stick]] to no effect. The shark proceeds to eat him whole before he can pull the pin from his [[grenade]] and kills him.\n\nHearing that the shark has been lured into the pipe, Mike and Kay go down to repair the underwater tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pumps to be shut down to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows it to break free from the pipe and attack Mike and Kay, but they are again saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room and the civilians in the underwater tunnel are safely evacuated. The shark suddenly appears in front of the window and smashes through the glass, flooding the control room and killing a technician. Mike notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat holding the grenade and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their battle with the shark.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Mike Brody\n*[[Bess Armstrong]] as Kathryn Morgan\n*[[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Philip FitzRoyce\n*[[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Calvin Bouchard\n*[[John Putch]] as Sean Brody\n*[[Lea Thompson]] as Kelly Ann Bukowski\n*[[P.

Lerner said that his \"heart sank\" when he was sent the first script of ''Jaws 3-D'', saying, \"I can't really get involved in this\". As the production already had an art director, Lerner, who didn't like the script, declined to be involved in the film.<ref name=\"Zone\"/>\n\nThe film was directed by Joe Alves, who was the [[production designer]] for the first two films and was the [[second unit director]] for ''Jaws 2''. It had been suggested that Alves co-direct the first sequel with [[Verna Fields]] when first director [[John D. Hancock]] left the project.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> It was filmed at [[SeaWorld Orlando]], a marine zoological park ; and [[Navarre, Florida]], a community in the [[Florida Panhandle]] near [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pohlen|2003|p=135}}</ref>\n\nAs with the first two films in the series, many people were involved in writing the film. [[Richard Matheson]], who had written the script for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', says that he wrote a \"very interesting\" outline, although the story is credited to \"some other writer\".<ref name=\"matheson\">{{harvnb|Weaver|2006|p=318}}</ref> Universal forced Matheson to include Brody's two sons, which the writer \"thought was dumb\". They also wanted it to be the same shark that was electrocuted in ''Jaws 2''.<ref name=\"matheson\"/> Matheson was also requested to write a role specifically for [[Mickey Rooney]], saying that \"when Mickey Rooney turned out not to be available, the whole part was pointless\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lofficier |2003|p=221}}</ref> The writer was unhappy with the finished film.\n\n<blockquote>I'm a good storyteller and I wrote a good outline and a good script. And if they had done it right and if it had been directed by somebody who knew how to direct, I think it would have been an excellent movie. ''Jaws 3-D'' was the only thing Joe Alves ever directed; the man is a very skilled production designer, but as a director, no.

''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' could also make dual use of the number three.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{harvnb|McGee|2001|pp=97\u20138}}</ref> The gimmick was also advertised in the tagline \"the third dimension is terror.\"<ref name=\"Saxelid\"/> As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, he thought that 3D would \"give him an edge\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/>\n\n[[File:Jaws 3 - shark explosion - 3-D effect.jpg|thumb|An example of the film's use of [[3D film|3D]]; the shark's jaws coming toward the viewer after its destruction.]]\nCinema audiences could wear disposable [[polarized glasses]] to view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying to the forefront of the screen, leaving a [[Doppler effect|trail]]. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the blue screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.<ref name=\"Zone\"/>\n\n''Jaws 3-D'' had two 3D consultants: the production started with [[Chris Condon]], president of StereoVision,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=American cinematographer, Volume 66 |author=American Society of Cinematographers |page=85 |publisher=ASC Holding Corp. |year=1985 }}</ref> and Stan Loth was later added to the team for the ArriVision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after a week for the ArriVision system, \"which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/> According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that \"the left and right images [in ''Jaws 3-D''] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though we do have the occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache.\"<ref name=\"McGee\"/><ref>The Alves quote in {{harvnb|McGee|2001}} originally appeared in Thornshaw, Brian \"Joe Alves and Jaws 3D\", ''Fangoria'', 1, 29</ref> Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units.<ref name=\"hayes\">{{harvnb|Hayes|1998|pp=101\u20133}}</ref> Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35&nbsp;mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half, a technique known as \"over/under\". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarized 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation\u2009\u2060\u2014\u2009something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective \"silver\" screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for ''Jaws 3-D'', the underwater sequences were shot using an [[Arriflex]] 35\u20133 camera with Arrivision 18&nbsp;mm over/under 3D lens.<ref name=\"Ankeney\"/>\n\nThis kind of 3D effect does not work on television without special electronic hardware at the viewer's end, and so with two exceptions, the home video and broadcast TV versions of ''Jaws 3-D'' were created using just the left-eye image, and with the title changed to ''Jaws 3'' or ''Jaws III''. Because the left-eye image only takes up half the 35&nbsp;mm film frame, the picture resolution is noticeably poorer than would normally be expected of a film shot on 35&nbsp;mm.\n\nOne of the exceptions was a 1986 release of the film for the now-obsolete [[Video High Density]] (VHD) video disc system. This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarized 3D effect to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disclord.tripod.com/vhddiscworld/id1.html|title=3D Compatible Video|website=disclord.tripod.com|access-date=January 3, 2007}}</ref> The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of ''Jaws 3-D'' released in February 2008.

One reviewer says of ''Jaws 3-D'':\n\n<blockquote>Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful dialogue all contribute to making ''Jaws 3'' a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.

She says that after taking too long for him to be introduced, the character is \"essentially a passive onlooker.\" There is no hunt until the climax when the shark is terrorizing the people in the aquarium; only then does Mike Brody become centre of the action. She also highlights inaccuracies in the plot. For instance, she refutes the idea of a \"mother shark protecting her offspring [as] sharks do not mother their young,\" and points out that dolphins can attack sharks.<ref>{{harvnb|Aronson |2000}}</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] calls the film a \"road-company Irwin Allen type-disaster film\" and notes that its premise is similar to the [[Revenge of the Creature|1955 sequel to ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'']].<ref>{{cite book |title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn=978-0-452-28978-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/707 707\u2013708] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/707 }}</ref>\n\n''Jaws 3-D'' was nominated for five [[1983 Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Lou Gossett, Jr.), Screenplay, and Newcomer (Cindy and Sandy, \"The Shrieking Dolphins\"), but received none.<ref>{{cite web |title=1983 Archive |work=Razzies.com |url=http://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=23 |access-date=2006-12-10 |archive-date=October 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028195413/http://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Awards and nominations\n|-\n!
