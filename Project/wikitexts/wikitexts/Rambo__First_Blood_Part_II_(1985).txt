Cosmatos]] and co-written by [[Sylvester Stallone]], who also reprises his role as [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]]. A sequel to ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982), it is the second installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo III]]''. It co-stars [[Richard Crenna]], who reprises his role as [[Sam Trautman|Colonel Sam Trautman]], with [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]], [[Julia Nickson]], and [[Steven Berkoff]].\n\nThe film's plot is inspired by the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]]. In the film, Rambo gets released from prison in a deal with the U.S. government to document the possible existence of missing [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] in [[Vietnam]], but with strict orders not to rescue them. When Rambo defies his orders, he is abandoned and forced to rely once more on his own brutal combat skills to save the POWs.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' was a major worldwide box office blockbuster, with an estimated 42 million tickets sold in the US. It has become one of the most recognized and memorable installments in the series, having inspired countless rip-offs, parodies, video games, and imitations. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the movie number 23 on its list of \"The Best Rock-'em, Sock-'em Movies of the Past 25 Years\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20219939_2,00.html |title=The Action 25 Films: The Best Rock-'em, Sock-'em Movies of the Past 25 Years |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] at [[Wayback Machine]] |date=January 30, 2009 |access-date=October 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203113241/http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20219939_2,00.html |archive-date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nThree years after the incident in Hope, Washington, former [[United States Army|US Army]] [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] [[John Rambo]] receives a visit from his former mission commander and old friend, [[Sam Trautman|Col. Sam Trautman]], at a rural labor work prison. With the [[Vietnam War]] now officially over, the public has become increasingly concerned over news that a small group of US [[prisoner of war|POWs]] have been [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|left in enemy custody]] in [[Vietnam]].\n\nTo placate their demands for action, the US government has authorized a solo infiltration mission to confirm the reports. Rambo agrees to undertake the operation in exchange for a pardon. In [[Thailand]], he is taken to meet Marshall Murdock, the bureaucrat overseeing the operation. Rambo is temporarily reinstated into the US Army and instructed only to take pictures of the suspected POW camp and not to rescue any prisoners or engage enemy personnel, as they will be retrieved by a better equipped extraction team upon his return.\n\nDuring his insertion, Rambo's parachute becomes tangled and breaks, causing him to lose his guns and most of his equipment, leaving him with only his knife, his bow, and his arrows. He meets his assigned contact, a young female Vietnamese intelligence agent named Co Bao, who arranges for a local band of [[river pirates]] to take them upriver. Reaching the camp, Rambo spots one of the prisoners tied to a cross-shaped post, left to suffer from exposure, and rescues him against orders.\n\nDuring their escape, they are discovered by Vietnamese troops and attacked by an armored gunboat; causing the pirates to betray them, revealing they swapped allegiance to the Vietnamese and intend to hand them over for a reward. Rambo kills the pirates and destroys the gunboat with an [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] while the POW and Co Bao swim to safety. Rambo asks Co to stay behind shortly before they reach the extraction point. The rescue helicopter is ordered by Murdock to abort the rescue, saying Rambo has violated his orders.\n\nCo Bao watches as Rambo and the POW are recaptured and returned to the camp. When Trautman confronts him, Murdock reveals that he never intended to save the POWs, explaining that Congress expected Rambo to find nothing, and that even if he did, Murdock would simply leave him to die to avoid having to deal with the issue any further. Trautman is then told he will be removed from the mission to keep him from trying to help Rambo on his own.\n\nRambo learns that [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops are working with the Vietnamese army. He is interrogated by the local liaison, Lieutenant Col. Podovsky, and his right-hand man, Sgt. Yushin. Upon learning of Rambo's mission from intercepted [[missives]], Podovsky demands that Rambo should broadcast a message to Murdock warning against any further rescue missions for the POWs. Meanwhile, Co infiltrates the camp disguised as a [[prostitute]] and hides under the hut where Rambo is being brutally tortured with [[Electrical injury#Torture|electric shocks]].\n\nRambo refuses to cooperate, but relents when the prisoner he tried to save is threatened. As he begins to read the scripted comments, Rambo directly threatens Murdock, overpowers the Soviets, and escapes the camp with Co's help. Rambo agrees to take Co to the United States, and they kiss. As they start moving again, a small Vietnamese force attacks the pair and Co is killed during the assault. An enraged Rambo guns down the soldiers and buries Co in the mud.\n\nRambo snaps and, with the use of his knife and bow, he systematically dispatches the numerous Soviet and Vietnamese soldiers sent after him one after the other - even blowing up the Vietnamese officer who killed Co with an explosive arrow. After surviving a [[barrel bomb]] dropped by Yushin's helicopter, Rambo climbs on board and throws Yushin out of the cabin to his death. The pilot is forced out at knifepoint, and Rambo takes control. He lays waste to the prison camp and wipes out the rest of the enemy forces before extracting the POWs and heading towards friendly territory in Thailand.\n\nPodovsky, pursuing them in a helicopter gunship, seemingly shoots the chopper down and moves in for the kill. Having faked the crash, Rambo uses a rocket launcher to destroy the aircraft; killing Podovsky. As he returns to base with the POWs, Rambo (after using the helicopter's machine gun to destroy Murdock's office) confronts the terrified Marshall with his knife; demanding that Murdock rescue the remaining POWs.\n\nTrautman tries to convince Rambo to return home now that he has been pardoned. When Rambo refuses, Trautman asks what he wants. An irate Rambo responds that he only wants his country to love its soldiers as much as its soldiers love it. Trautman asks Rambo how he will live now, to which Rambo tersely says, \"Day by day\". With that, the film credits roll as Rambo walks off into the distance.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

It was later rescheduled for August 1, 1985.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Rambo: First Blood Part II|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58323-RAMBO-FIRSTBLOODPARTII?sid=250a8fac-48e3-4307-8f84-fb9f5fb87363&sr=16.122898&cp=1&pos=0|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-11|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Producers considered that Rambo would have a partner in the rescue mission of POWs. The producers allegedly wanted [[John Travolta]] to play Rambo's sidekick, but Stallone [[veto]]ed the idea.<ref name=\"win\">''We Get to Win This Time'', 2002, Artisan Entertainment</ref> [[Lee Marvin]] (who was considered to play Colonel Trautman in the first film) was offered the role of Marshall Murdock, but declined, leading to the role being played by [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]].\n\nThen up-and-coming screenwriter [[Kevin Jarre]] had written a story treatment that was liked by both the producers and Stallone, as Jarre later recalled in an interview in the documentary ''Tinsel - The Lost Movie About Hollywood'':<blockquote> \"I wrote the first draft of \"Rambo\". And I just did it, I was living on dog food at the time and I, you know, I needed a gig and I wanted to finish a spec script I was writing. And you know, they called, Stallone called me in and they had this idea about what they should do in the sequel to \"[[First Blood]]\" and I said, \"Well, how about if maybe he searches for POWs in Southeast Asia and back in Vietnam? He said \"Great, let\u2019s do it\"</blockquote>\n\n[[James Cameron]] was then hired to pen a first draft of the screenplay (Cameron had been recommended by [[David Giler]] who did some uncredited script work on the first film) which he was concurrently writing along with ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', both of which he would go on to direct. Cameron's first draft was titled ''First Blood II: The Mission''.<ref>{{cite news|author=BROESKE, P. H.|date=Oct 27, 1985|title=THE CURIOUS EVOLUTION OF JOHN RAMBO|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|154252710}}}}</ref> According to Cameron, his script had the same basic structure of the first film, but was more violent than its predecessor. Cameron was quoted in a October 1986 issue of ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland|Monsterland]]'' magazine:<blockquote> \"It was quite a different film from FIRST BLOOD, apart from the continuation of the Rambo character. The first one was set in a small town, it had a different social consciousness from the second one, which was a very broad, stylized adventure. It was a little more violent in its execution than I had in mind in the writing\"</blockquote>\n\nFollowing Cameron\u2019s initial draft, Stallone would take over scriptwriting duties, creating a final draft which differed from previous versions. Jarre would receive sole story credit, while Stallone and Cameron would get credited for the screenplay in the final film.\n\nStallone later recalled:\n<blockquote>I think that James Cameron is a brilliant talent, but I thought the politics were important, such as a [[Conservatism in the United States|right-wing]] stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis, Murdock, contrasted by Rambo's obvious neutrality, which I believe is explained in Rambo's final speech. I realize his speech at the end may have caused millions of viewers to burst veins in their eyeballs by rolling them excessively, but the sentiment stated was conveyed to me by many veterans. ... [Also] in his original draft it took nearly 30-40 pages to have any action initiated and Rambo was partnered with a tech-y sidekick. So it was more than just politics that were put into the script. There was also a simpler story line. If James Cameron says anything more than that, then he realizes he's now doing the backstroke badly in a pool of lies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932|title=Stallone answers December 9th & 10th Questions in a double round \u2013 plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA ...|author=headgeek|date=December 16, 2006|work=Aint It Cool News}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore filming started, Stallone went through torturous trainings to build the perfect musculature. Writer David J. Moore said in the 2019 documentary film ''In Search of the Last Action Heroes'': \"Here's a guy who went against the grain in everything that he ever did. Here's a guy who transformed himself, literally he chiseled his own body into this statuesque, muscular specimen.\"<ref name=\"insearch\">''In Search of the Last Action Heroes''.

During filming, special effects man Clifford P Wenger, Jr. was accidentally killed by one of the film's explosions.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Rambo: First Blood Part II (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = Film\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1985\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = \n| label      = \n| producer   = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| prev_title = [[Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend#Soundtrack|Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]\n| prev_year  = 1985\n| next_title = [[Explorers (film)#Soundtrack|Explorers: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| next_year  = 1985\n}}\n\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], conducting the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]], although, Goldsmith uses heavily on electronic synthesized elements in the film score.

Female characters seem to be aroused by John Rambo's muscular physique, and [[Sophia Petrillo]] ([[Estelle Getty]]) says: \"I sat through it twice. You'll love it! He sweats like a pig and he doesn't put his shirt on!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quotes.net/mquote/899929|title=The Golden Girls quotes|publisher=Quotes.net|access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohshutuprose.com/2017/02/on-golden-girls-s1e6.html|title=On Golden Girls S1E6|publisher=Oh Shut Up Rose!|access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Other media ==\n=== Sequel ===\n{{Main|Rambo III}}\nA sequel titled ''Rambo III'', was released in 1988.\n\n=== Novelization ===\n[[David Morrell]], author of ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'', the novel the first ''Rambo'' film is based on, wrote a [[novelization]] called ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''.\n\n=== Video games ===\nA tie-in video game was produced for [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Commodore 64]] called ''[[Rambo (1985 video game)|Rambo]]''. There was also ''[[Rambo (1987 video game)|Rambo]]'' for [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] as well as a ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II (Master System video game)|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', for [[Sega]]. [[MSX]] and [[DOS]] games based on the film. [[Sega]] later adapted some of the battle scenes in the film for the 2008 [[arcade game]] ''[[Rambo (2008 video game)|Rambo]]''. In 2014 was released ''[[Rambo: The Video Game]]'', based on the first three ''Rambo'' films.\n\nThe 1986 [[Run and gun game|run-and-gun shooter]] arcade hit ''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' was originally intended by its developer [[SNK]] to be an official licensed adaptation of ''Rambo''. However, they were initially unable to acquire the rights to the film. This resulted in the game's title being changed to ''Ikari'', referencing part of the film's Japanese title, ''Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu'' (\"Rambo: The Furious Escape\"). After the game made its North American debut at an arcade game expo, they managed to get in touch with Sylvester Stallone about acquiring the rights to the film. However, it was too late by that point, as the game had already become popularly known by its Japanese title ''Ikari'' among arcade players in Japan and North America, leading to the game being officially released as ''Ikari Warriors'' in North America. Stallone was friends with SNK's president at the time, and owned an ''Ikari Warriors'' arcade cabinet.<ref name=\"Continue\">{{cite journal |title=\u300c\u6012\u300d\u3092\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u7537 |trans-title=The Man Who Made \"Ikari\" |journal=[[:ja:CONTINUE (\u96d1\u8a8c)|Continue]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://shmuplations.com/snkgoldenage/}}</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\n* ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'', an American film inspired by ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theflickcast.com/2011/05/16/war-movie-mondays-missing-in-action/|title=War Movie Mondays, ''Missing in Action'' Movie Review|date=16 May 2011|publisher=The Flick Cast|access-date=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n* ''[[Strike Commando]]'', an Italian film described as an imitator of ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''<ref>{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1987-1988|volume=20|publisher=[[R.

Late in the film, Yankovic's character, George Newman, has a fantasy in which he envisions himself as a Rambo-type soldier on mission to rescue Stanley Spadowski ([[Michael Richards]]) from a rival station owner's goons, during which Yankovic wears a muscular body suit to imitate Stallone's physique. The fantasy sequence is a parody exaggeration of the action sequences in about the last third of ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''. Stallone himself had initially agreed to make a cameo appearance in the sequence, but ultimately declined to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/uhf-movie-sylvester-stallone-rambo-cameo-rejection/|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|author=Cotter, Padraig|title=Why Stallone Backed Out Of A Cameo In UHF's Rambo Parody Sequence|language=en-US|url-status=live|date=February 19, 2022|accessdate=March 26, 2022|archivedate=February 19, 2022|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219194622/https://screenrant.com/uhf-movie-sylvester-stallone-rambo-cameo-rejection/}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0089880}}\n* {{AllMovie title|40204}}\n* {{AFI film|id=58323|title=Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\n* {{mojo title|rambo2}}\n\n{{Rambo}}\n{{George P.
