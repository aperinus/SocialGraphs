It is an American and Canadian co-production.\n\n==Plot==\nAndy writes the local newspaper classified advertisements, and has been going from relationship to relationship since eighth grade. He loses custody of his dog when his girlfriend, Cheryl, breaks up with him for another man\u2014a punk rocker named Trevor.\n\nAndy then meets Lorna, a children's TV show host, but she is too obsessed with her own dog. She's also still emotionally fragile because her boyfriend was Trevor, who left her for Andy's ex, Cheryl. Andy meets her in a bar and takes her home as she seems interested. They begin making out, but it stops there as she throws up.\n\nKnowing Lorna works for the TV station, Andy sends her roses and a note requesting a relationship and even calls, but she decides not to pursue. He moves on by putting himself in a dating auction. Lorna spends some time alone and finally goes out on a date with the clerk from the video store, Callum. It's not much of date, but he helps her out in a big way with the message he leaves on her machine.\n\nAndy gets involved with the woman who won him in the auction, Kieran, a vegan nutritionist, who believes a lot of sex is beneficial. Meanwhile, Cheryl and Andy take their dog to a psychiatrist, who tells them that her having rough sex near the dog is traumatizing it.\n\nWhile both Andy and Cheryl do their best to share custody, problems arise as Cheryl and Trevor break up and she unsuccessfully tries to win Andy back. On a double date, Keiran figures out Jeri's boyfriend Jeff is having an affair observing his body language on the phone.\n\nWhen Rachel goes to the obedience school graduation to see Jeff's dogs get their diplomas, one of the dogs runs to Rachel and Jeri deduces the affair. They break up. Andy goes to her side to console her.\n\nBoth Andy and Lorna have feelings for each other, but aren't sure how to follow through with it. Andy dating Kieran and Lorna having a date with Callum help them come to a very important conclusion. They meet up at the bar where they first met 100 days later... and start a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Jeri\n* [[Natasha Henstridge]] as Lorna\n* [[Bruce McCulloch]] as Jeff\n* [[Mark McKinney]] as Dog Psychologist\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as Cheryl\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Callum\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Andy\n* [[Kristin Lehman]] as Keiran\n* [[Amie Carey]] as Rachel\n* [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Trevor\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Neighbor\n* [[Jerry Schaefer]] as Norm\n* [[Zachary Bennett]] as Dougie\n* [[Ron James (comedian)|Ron James]] as Male Dog Owner #1\n* [[Albert Schultz]] as Male Dog Owner #2\n* [[Terri Hawkes]] as Announcer\n* [[Michael Bean (Canadian actor)|Michael Bean]] as Driver\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 25 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dog Park|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dog_park/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=29 May 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 46% score, based on 14 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dog Park |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dog-park |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=29 May 2017 }}</ref> \n[[Mick LaSalle]] from [[San Francisco Chronicle]] wrote: \"Dog Park is clever and pleasant and holds interest. Janeane Garofalo is restrained as a cynical and sensitive magazine editor, and Bruce McCulloch, who wrote the script and directed the picture, plays her boyfriend.
