The film, which is based on [[Moon landing conspiracy theories]], had its world premiere at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] on March 14, 2015. It had a [[limited release]] on January 15, 2016 and was available through [[video on demand]] by [[Alchemy (company)|Alchemy]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the days leading up to the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Tom Kidman is tasked with hiring [[Stanley Kubrick]] to film a fake moonwalk, in the event the astronauts fail in their mission. The CIA views the Moon landing as a potential ideological victory over the [[Soviet Union]], necessary for American morale. The CIA gives Kidman a large sum of cash as an incentive for Kubrick, and orders him to murder Kubrick when the film is complete to prevent the story from leaking. Unbeknownst to the CIA, Kidman is suffering from [[post traumatic stress disorder]] due to his time in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and responds to any frustration with extreme violence.\n\nKidman travels to England to speak with Kubrick's agent, only to accidentally hold a meeting with the agent's cousin, Jonny Thorpe, a struggling band promoter in debt to an [[East end of London|East End]] gangster named the Iron Monger. Jonny agrees to arrange a sit-down between Kidman and Kubrick, then convinces his stoner roommate Leon to pose as the director. Leon and Kidman meet, and Jonny accepts the briefcase of money, promising the movie will be made. Thinking Kidman is simply a Hollywood producer, the pair go on a spending spree before the Iron Monger's henchman break into Jonny's house, beat him, and steal the briefcase.\n\nKidman sees Stanley Kubrick on television and realizes he's been duped. He confronts Jonny, who confesses his scheme. Seeing an opportunity to establish himself as a success, Jonny promises that a friend of his, a director named Renatus, can film a fake Moon landing. Jonny takes Kidman to meet Renatus at the director's mansion, which he has turned into a [[Intentional community|commune]]. Thinking he's being hired for an art project, Renatus accepts. Meanwhile, a [[hippie]] girl named Ella takes an interest in Kidman.\n\nKidman takes Jonny to confront the Iron Monger and get the briefcase of money back. Rather than negotiate with the Iron Monger, Kidman murders several of his henchmen and takes the briefcase back by force. Production is stalled when Renatus insists on approaching the film as a piece of [[performance art]], intending to include several artistic flourishes. In an attempt to show off his alleged immunity to marijuana, Kidman takes a hit from a [[bong]], which turns out to have been laced with opium. In an effort to help him recover from its effects, Ella gives him [[LSD]], sending Kidman on a [[bad trip]], after which he has sex with Ella. In the throes of his trip, Kidman tells Ella and Leon he no longer feels compelled to solve his problems with violence. Afterwards, he makes an incoherent call to the CIA, attempting to update them on his status.\n\nAlarmed by Kidman's call, the CIA sends several agents to England. They take the entire commune hostage and force everyone to begin filming the fake Moon landing. Jonny and Leon take on the roles of the astronauts; Leon, nervous at the prospect of being on television, gets high and begins having a trip on set, stumbling around the fake Moon surface. Meanwhile, the Iron Monger arrives and engages in a shootout with the CIA, in which most of the Iron Monger's henchmen and CIA agents are killed. In the midst of the shootout, the fake footage is successfully broadcast via closed circuit to CIA headquarters. Jonny, feeling he finally has the opportunity to make a difference in the world, attempts to protect Kidman from the Iron Monger, but is shot. After killing the Iron Monger, Kidman tells a stunned Jonny that his spacesuit absorbed the bullet, and lies that Jonny's interference saved his life.\n\nNow wanted by the CIA, Jonny, Leon, Kidman and Ella flee England. A montage shows news clips of American life through the 1960s, culminating with [[Apollo 11]] reaching the Moon. In [[Spain]], Jonny, Leon, Ella and Kidman enter a bar in time to watch the Moon landing with several villagers. They are unable to tell if the landing is real or if they're watching their own fake footage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ron Perlman]] as Kidman\n*[[Rupert Grint]] as Jonny Thorpe\n*[[Robert Sheehan]] as Leon\n*Eric Lampaert as Glen\n*Tom Audenaert as Renatus\n*[[Kerry Shale]] as Mr. White\n*John Flanders as CIA Agent Murphy\n*Andrew Blumenthal as Kozinsky\n*[[Jay Benedict]] as Colonel Dickford\n* [[Kevin Bishop]] as Paul\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Dawson\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Derek Kaye\n* [[Erika Sainte]] as Ella\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2014, it was announced that [[Ron Perlman]], [[Rupert Grint]], [[Robert Sheehan]], [[Stephen Campbell Moore]], [[Kevin Bishop]] and [[James Cosmo]] had joined the cast of the film.<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite web|author=Elsa Keslassy |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/kinology-boards-british-action-comedy-moonwalkers-with-ron-perlman-and-rupert-grint-exclusive-1201214103/ |title=Kinology Boards British Action-Comedy 'Moonwalkers' With Ron Perlman and Rupert Grint (EXCLUSIVE) |publisher=Variety |date=2014-06-06 |access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> It was also announced Antoine Bardou-Jacquet would be directing the film, from a screenplay by [[Dean Craig]].<ref name=\"variety1\"/> It was also announced Kinology had signed on to finance the film and handle international sales.<ref name=\"variety1\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on May 14, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-51914-christoph-waltz-starrer-tulip-fever-starts-for-the-weinstein-co/ |title=On The Set For 5/19/14: Christoph Waltz-Starrer 'Tulip Fever' Starts For The Weinstein Co. |publisher=SSN Insider |date=2014-05-19 |access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 14, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_FS18645 |title=Moonwalkers &#124; SXSW 2015 Event Schedule |publisher=Schedule.sxsw.com |date= |access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> On March 16, 2015, [[Alchemy (company)|Alchemy]] picked up distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/moonwalkers-action-comedy-lands-at-alchemy-sxsw-1201393259/ |title='Moonwalkers' Action Comedy Lands At Alchemy |publisher=Deadline |date=2015-03-16 |access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on January 15, 2016, in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/922065-exclusive-poster-moonwalkers-says-moon-landings-groovy-faked|title=Exclusive Poster 'Moonwalkers' Says Moon Landings Were Groovy, But Faked|publisher=CraveOnline.com|first=William|last=Bibbiani|date=November 10, 2015|access-date=November 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218022827/http://www.craveonline.com/culture/922065-exclusive-poster-moonwalkers-says-moon-landings-groovy-faked|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Moonwalkers'' received mixed reviews from film critics.
