It stars [[Rutger Hauer]] as the title character, a murderous hitchhiker who stalks a young motorist ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) across the highways of [[West Texas]]. [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nReleased in the United States on February 21, 1986, the film was initially met with tepid critical and commercial response, grossing $5.8 million on a $7.9 million budget. Opinion of ''The Hitcher'' improved in later years, however, with Hauer's performance receiving praise. The film was followed by a [[The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting|2003 sequel]], which featured Howell reprising his role, and a [[The Hitcher (2007 film)|2007 remake]].\n\n==Plot==\nJim Halsey, a young man delivering a car from [[Chicago]] to [[San Diego]], spots a man hitchhiking in the [[West Texas]] desert and gives him a ride. The brooding and evasive hitcher, who calls himself John Ryder, forces Jim's leg down on the accelerator when they pass a stranded car. Ryder states he murdered the driver and intends to do the same to Jim, threatening him with a [[switchblade]]. Terrified, Jim asks what Ryder wants. He replies, \"I want you to stop me.\" When Jim realizes that Ryder's seat belt is unbuckled and the passenger door is ajar, he shoves Ryder out of the moving car.\n\nRelieved, Jim continues his journey. When he sees Ryder in the back of a family car, Jim tries to warn the occupants, but has a minor [[Traffic collision|accident]]. He later comes across the family's blood-soaked car and vomits after peeking inside. Ryder then corners Jim but simply tosses him the keys from Jim's car. Ryder leaves with a trucker, and later nearly runs Jim down with the truck as it crashes into the pumps of a gas station. As Jim flees, Ryder causes the station to explode.\n\nAt a roadside diner, Jim meets Nash, a waitress who cooks him lunch while he calls the police. He starts eating until he finds a severed finger among his [[French fries]], indicating Ryder's proximity. The police arrive immediately but they arrest Jim, whom Ryder is now framing for his murders. During interrogation, Sergeant Starr infers Jim's innocence. However, he instructs his two deputies to lock Jim up overnight as protocol, until other [[law enforcement]] arrives from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] for further questioning. Jim wakes to find the cell door unlocked and the three officers murdered. He panics and flees with a revolver. At a gas station, he sees two officers, takes them hostage, and speaks on the radio to Captain Esteridge, the officer in charge of the manhunt. As Esteridge convinces Jim to surrender, Ryder shows up and kills the two officers.\n\nThe patrol car crashes, and Ryder disappears again. After briefly considering suicide, Jim reaches a cafe, where Ryder confronts him. He points out Jim's revolver is unloaded, and proves it by challenging Jim to shoot him. Ryder also remains oblique about his reasons for tormenting him, and after cryptically [[Charon's obol|placing two coins on Jim's eyes]], leaves him several bullets and departs. Jim boards a bus, where he meets Nash and explains his situation. After a police car pulls the bus over, Jim surrenders. The furious officers accuse him of killing their colleagues and attempt to [[Extrajudicial killing|kill him]]. Nash appears with Jim's revolver, disarms the officers, and flees with Jim in their patrol car. As the police chase after them, Ryder joins the chase and murders the officers by causing a massive car accident and shooting down a police helicopter.\n\nJim and Nash abandon the patrol car and hike to a motel. While Jim is in the shower, Ryder abducts Nash and Jim immediately searches for her. Captain Esteridge discovers Jim and enlists him to try to negotiate with Ryder, who is at the wheel of a large Mack truck. Ryder has gagged and tied Nash between the truck and its [[Tow hitch|trailer hitch]], and is threatening to [[Dismemberment|tear her apart]]. Esteridge tells Jim that his men cannot shoot Ryder because his foot would slip off the clutch, causing the truck to roll. Jim enters the cab with Ryder, who gives him a revolver and tells him to shoot, but Jim is unable to do so. Ryder, disappointed, releases the clutch, killing Nash.\n\nRyder is taken into custody. Esteridge gives Jim a ride, but Jim, believing the police cannot hold Ryder, takes Esteridge's revolver and vehicle to chase down Ryder's prison bus. Ryder kills the deputies and leaps through Jim's windshield as the bus crashes. Jim slams on his brakes, sending Ryder through the windshield and onto the road. Ryder challenges Jim to run him over, which he does. When Jim leaves his car to look at Ryder's body, Ryder jumps up, but Jim shoots him repeatedly with a shotgun, finally killing him. Jim leans against Esteridge's car in a daze, and smokes a cigarette as the sun sets.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as John Ryder\n* [[C.

While driving from one city to another, he got the idea for a film from [[The Doors]] song \"[[Riders on the Storm]]\". He found that the \"elements of the song \u2013 a killer on the road in a storm plus the cinematic feel of the music \u2013 would make a terrific opening for a film\".<ref name=\"Arrow\">{{cite news|title=The Arrow Interviews... Eric Red |work=Arrow in the Head |url=https://joblo.com/arrow/interview34.htm |access-date=2010-05-26}}</ref> Red had a lot of time to think about the song and it inspired ideas for the story. During his seven-month stay in Austin, he drove a taxi cab and wrote ''The Hitcher''.<ref name=\"Cullum\">{{cite news|last=Cullum |first=Paul |title=Death Race 2000 |work=[[L.A. Weekly]] |date=January 12, 2006 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2006-01-12/news/death-race-2000 |access-date=2010-05-23}}</ref> In 1983, he sent a letter to several Hollywood producers asking if he could send them a copy of the screenplay for ''The Hitcher''. His letter concluded: \"It (the story) grabs you by the guts and does not let up and it does not let go. When you read it, you will not sleep for a week. When the movie is made, the country will not sleep for a week\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> Script development executive David Bombyk received a copy of Red's letter and was intrigued by the description of the film. Red sent him a script that was approximately 190 pages in length (one page traditionally equals one minute of screen time).<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn the original script, an entire family is slaughtered in their station wagon, an eyeball is discovered inside of a hamburger, a woman is tied to a truck and a pole and then torn in half, two teenagers engage in sex, and there is a decapitation as well as several slashings, shootings and car crashes. In its original form, Bombyk found the script to be \"extremely brutal and extremely gory\", but he and personal manager Kip Ohman (who later became co-producers of the film) also saw in it \"a level of challenge, intensity and poetry\".<ref name=Caulfield/> Bombyk and Ohman were worried about getting it into good enough shape to show their boss, producer Ed Feldman, and his partner, Charles Meeker, and prove to them that it was more than an exploitation film. Bombyk worked with Red via several long-distance phone calls to Texas and eventually the writer moved to Los Angeles. Red agreed to work with Ohman on the script until it was ready to be shown to Feldman and Meeker. They liked the script but wondered, \"how could we manage to translate it to the screen without making a slasher movie?\" Meeker said.<ref name=Caulfield/>\n\nFeldman and Meeker decided to come on board as executive producers.<ref name=Caulfield/> Ohman and Red spent six months reworking the script, removing most of what Ohman felt was repetitive violence. Once they got it in good enough shape, Ohman gave it back to Bombyk and also to David Madden, a production executive for [[20th Century Fox]]. Within a few days, Madden called back and told them the script was \"terrific\".<ref name=Caulfield/> The studio was not comfortable with the subject matter but felt that the writing was unique and interesting enough to give the filmmakers a letter-of-intent to distribute the film. This would allow them to get financing and then, once filming was completed, the studio would reimburse them for the budget.<ref name=Caulfield/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe film's producers then went looking for an inexpensive director.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> Still photographer-turned-cameraman Robert Harmon was given a copy of the script by his agent and called his agent early next morning, telling him that he wanted to do it. In February 1984, Harmon met the producers to talk about the script. He recalled that \"even the exact actions that remained in the script were described in much bloodier and gorier detail\".<ref name=Caulfield/> The producers were impressed with him and the fact that he also envisioned the film as a Hitchcockian thriller. However, Harmon objected to the eyeball in the hamburger scene and never planned to show the girl getting ripped in half.<ref name=Caulfield/>\n\nIn early drafts of the script, John Ryder had been described as skeletal in nature and so actors like [[David Bowie]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Terence Stamp]] were mentioned.<ref name=Caulfield/> Harmon was set on casting Stamp and even carried around his picture to pitch meetings. Stamp received a copy of the script but turned down the role. [[Sam Elliott]] was offered the role but an agreement could not be reached on his salary. [[Michael Ironside]] was also considered for the role.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Will|last=Murray|title=Michael Ironside Isn't a Psychopath |magazine=[[Starlog]]|issue=155|date=June 1990|url= https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-155/155_djvu.txt}}</ref> Singer mentioned Dutch actor Rutger Hauer. While in L.A. for a short visit, Hauer read the script. Even though he was looking for non-villainous roles, the script \"really got a hold of me ... I thought, 'If I do one more villain, I should do this.' I couldn't refuse it\".<ref name=Caulfield/> The one reservation Hauer had was with the scene where the girl is torn apart and Feldman told him, \"you ''are'' the bad guy and you'll be the baddest bad guy there ever was!\"<ref name=Caulfield/> Red mentioned to Hauer that he had [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Keith Richards]] in mind when he wrote the part of Ryder.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hauer |first=Rutger |title=All Those Moments |publisher=Harper Entertainment |page=152 |year=2007 }}</ref> Furthermore, Red felt that the character should have an electronic voice box.<ref>Hauer 2007, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFor the role of Jim Halsey, the producers mentioned [[Matthew Modine]], [[Tom Cruise]], and [[Emilio Estevez]].<ref name=Caulfield/> They agreed on C. Thomas Howell and liked his look. At the time, Howell was being more selective with the roles he took and heard that the script was a generic thriller. Harmon personally gave Howell a copy of the script. He could not put it down and \"couldn't believe the things that happened to my character in the first 12 pages. I knew I wanted to do it\". He also wanted to work with Hauer.<ref name=Caulfield/> Unbeknownst to Hauer, Howell found him \"frightening, intimidating, and that he was in a constant state of fear, almost as if he really was John Ryder and I really was Jim Halsey\".<ref>Hauer 2007, p. 155.</ref>\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh agreed to do the film because she wanted to work with Hauer again (they co-starred in ''[[Flesh & Blood (film)|Flesh + Blood]]''), and loved the character of Nash because \"there was a real person there\".<ref name=Caulfield/>\n\nIn addition, veteran character actors [[Billy Green Bush]] (known for playing ill-fated police officers in ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' and ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]''), [[Gene Davis (actor)|Gene Davis]] (known for playing the naked psychopathic killer Warren Stacy in ''[[10 to Midnight]]''), [[Armin Shimerman]] (who would later be the voice of [[General Skarr]] in ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]''), and [[Emmy]]-winner [[Henry Darrow]], have supporting roles as police officers who pursue Jim Halsey.\n\n===Pre-production===\nFox ultimately rejected the project over the budget and saw it as a \"straight-out horror movie\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> Madden also admitted that he would have \"argued to soften the movie. There were some people at the studio who thought it was pretty gross\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> Feldman and Meeker optioned the film themselves, paying Red $25,000. Major studios like [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] passed on it, as did smaller ones like [[Orion Pictures]] and [[New World Pictures]]. Many executives liked the script but balked at the girl being ripped apart scene. At least two studios were willing to consider making it but only if Harmon was replaced. However, the film's producers had faith in their director and stuck by Harmon.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\nIndependent producer Donna Dubrow heard about ''The Hitcher'' while working on another film and to her it sounded like \"''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' with a person\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> When she went to work for [[Silver Screen Partners]]/[[HBO|Home Box Office]], she contacted Feldman, a former employer, and asked for a copy of the script. She submitted it to her boss, HBO senior vice-president Maurice Singer. He liked it and sent it back to New York to be read by Michael Fuchs, HBO chairman and chief operating officer. They needed Fuchs' approval to get the film made.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> It would not be easy to convince him because it was not the kind of material that he liked and he did not want to make it. However, Dubrow had to go back to New York on other business and met with Fuchs. She mentioned ''The Hitcher'' script and pitched the Hitchcockian thriller angle. When she returned to L.A., Singer told her that Fuchs agreed to make the film but with the stipulation that the girl would not be torn apart and the violence would be reduced. The film's budget was set at $5.8 million.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\nOver the next few months, the filmmakers negotiated two key scenes in the script: the girl getting ripped apart and the eyeball in the hamburger.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> For the latter scene, Harmon just changed the body part to a finger. As for the former, everyone at HBO/Silver Screen, except Dubrow, wanted it changed. Fuchs did not want the girl to die and Dubrow argued that this would change the story significantly. There were arguments about how the girl should die and Dubrow remembers, \"they were trying to make her death not horrible, when \u2013 by the nature of the script \u2013 it had to be\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> The studio even suggested softening her death by having a funeral. The filmmakers refused to back down and Silver Screen executives finally relented at the last minute.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===In theaters===\nContractually, [[TriStar Pictures]] was obligated to distribute any film by HBO/Silver Screen. TriStar representatives saw an early screening and studio president David Matalon said, \"It's the best film that we have for 1986\".<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> ''The Hitcher'' opened in 800 theaters<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> on February 21, 1986, and made $2.1 million during its opening weekend, going on to gross $5.8 million in North America.<ref name=\"BoxOffice\">{{cite news|title=''The Hitcher'' |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hitcher.htm |access-date=2010-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Hitcher'' holds a 62% approval rating based on 37 critic reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 6/10.
