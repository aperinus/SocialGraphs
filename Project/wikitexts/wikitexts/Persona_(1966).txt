The story revolves around a young nurse named Alma (Andersson) and her patient, well-known stage actress Elisabet Vogler (Ullmann), who has suddenly stopped speaking. They move to a cottage, where Alma cares for Elisabet, confides in her, and begins having trouble distinguishing herself from her patient.\n\nCharacterized by elements of [[psychological horror]], ''Persona'' has been the subject of much critical analysis, interpretation, and debate. The film's exploration of duality, insanity, and [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] has been interpreted as reflecting the [[Jungian]] theory of ''[[persona (psychology)|persona]]'' and dealing with issues related to filmmaking, vampirism, homosexuality, motherhood, abortion, and other subjects. The experimental style of its prologue and storytelling has also been noted. The enigmatic film has been called the [[Mount Everest]] of cinematic analysis; according to film historian [[Peter Cowie]], \"Everything one says about ''Persona'' may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true\".{{refn|group=n|name=\"Interpretation\"|Professor [[Thomas Elsaesser]] likened the piece to Mount Everest and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in his essay for [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"Elsaesser\">{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |title=The Persistence of Persona |last=Elsaesser |first=Thomas |date=27 March 2014 |access-date=20 November 2016 |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121171658/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3116-the-persistence-of-persona |archive-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Cowie is quoted by academic Frank Gado and editor Lloyd Michaels, who found some exaggeration in Cowie's claim but agreed with the sentiment of the challenges of interpretation.{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=340}}}}\n\nBergman wrote ''Persona'' with Ullmann and Andersson in mind for the lead roles and the idea of exploring their identities, and shot the film in [[Stockholm]] and [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] in 1965. In production, the filmmakers experimented with effects, using smoke and a mirror to frame one scene and combining the lead characters' faces in post-production for one shot. Andersson defended a sexually explicit monologue in the screenplay and rewrote portions of it.\n\nWhen first released, ''Persona'' was edited because of its controversial subject matter. It received positive reviews, with Swedish press outlets coining the word ''Person(a)kult'' to describe its enthusiastic admirers. It won [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[4th Guldbagge Awards]], and was Sweden's entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The censored content was reinstated in English-language restorations in 2001. Many critics consider ''Persona'' one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], and it was ranked the fifth-best in ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s 1972 poll and 17th in 2012. It also influenced many later directors, including [[Robert Altman]] and [[David Lynch]].\n\n==Plot==\nA projector begins screening a series of images, including a [[crucifixion]], a spider and the killing of a lamb, and a boy wakes up in a hospital or [[morgue]]. He sees a large screen with a blurry image of two women. One of the women may be Alma, a young nurse assigned by a doctor to care for Elisabet Vogler. Elisabet is a stage actress who has suddenly [[muteness|stopped speaking]] and moving, which the doctors have determined is the result of willpower rather than physical or mental illness. In the hospital, Elisabet is distressed by television images of a man's self-immolation during the [[Vietnam War]]. Alma reads her a letter from Elisabet's husband that contains a photo of their son, and the actress tears the photograph up. The doctor speculates that Elisabet may recover better in a cottage by the sea, and sends her there with Alma.\n\nAt the cottage, Alma tells Elisabet that no one has ever really listened to her before. She talks about her fianc\u00e9, Karl-Henrik, and her first affair. Alma tells a story of how, while she was already in a relationship with Karl-Henrik, she [[Sun tanning|sunbathed]] in the nude with Katarina, a woman she had just met. Two young boys appeared, and Katarina initiated an [[orgy]]. Alma became pregnant, had an [[abortion in Sweden|abortion]] and continues to feel guilty.\n\n[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|thumb|alt=Iconic photograph of Jewish women and children being herded out of a building|Stroop Report photograph, found by Elisabet, of Polish Jews captured after the Warsaw Ghetto uprising]]\nAlma drives to town to mail their letters, and notices that Elisabet's is not sealed. She reads it. The letter says that Elisabet is \"studying\" Alma and mentions the nurse's orgy and abortion. Furious, Alma accuses Elisabet of using her for some purpose. In the resulting fight, she threatens to scald Elisabet with boiling water and stops when Elisabet begs her not to. This is the first time Alma is certain the actress has spoken since they met, though she thought Elisabet previously whispered to her when Alma was half-asleep. Alma tells her that she knows Elisabet is a terrible person; when Elisabet runs off, Alma chases her and begs for forgiveness. Later, Elisabet looks at the [[Warsaw Ghetto boy|famous photograph]] of Jews arrested in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] from the [[Stroop Report]].\n\nOne night, Alma hears a man outside calling for Elisabet; it is Elisabet's husband. He calls Alma \"Elisabet\" and, though the nurse tells him he is mistaken, they have sex. Alma meets with Elisabet to talk about why Elisabet tore up the photo of her son. Alma tells much of Elisabet's story: that she wanted the only thing she did not have, motherhood, and became pregnant. Regretting her decision, Elisabet attempted a failed [[self-induced abortion]] and gave birth to a boy whom she despises, but her son craves her love. Alma ends the story in distress, asserting her identity and denying that she is Elisabet. She later coaxes Elisabet to say the word \"nothing\", and leaves the cottage as a crew films her.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Interi\u00f6r fr\u00e5n Sophiahemmet - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0053286.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Old photograph of a hallway with people sitting|''Persona'' was written at the [[Sophiahemmet]] hospital.]]\nAccording to Bergman, the story had its roots in a chance encounter with past collaborator [[Bibi Andersson]]{{refn|group=n|name=\"Andersson\"|Bibi Andersson first starred in Bergman's films in 1957 (''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'') and ''[[The Devil's Eye]]'' in 1960, with her saying that he often cast her in na\u00efve roles.

This inspired the beginning of his story, a vision of two women \"wearing big hats and laying their hands alongside each other\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=321}} Andersson said, \"Liv and I had worked together before and we were very close\". Bergman had been in a romantic relationship with Andersson and was attracted to Ullmann; of ''Persona''{{'}}s conception, Andersson said, \"He saw our friendship, and he wanted to get ... inside of it.

Mostly when they're sick and I can help them. I'll marry and have children. I believe that is what life has in store for me in this world\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=339}} The last scene featuring Elisabet called for a close-up portraying \"A howling wide-open face, distorted by terror, with wild wide-open eyes and furrows of sweat running through her make-up ... [Her] face starts to move, assumes strange contours. The words become meaningless, running and jumping, finally vanishing altogether\".{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=126\u2013127}} }} Later in the production, this was replaced by the blood-drinking scene, Elisabet being taught to say the word \"nothing\" and Alma leaving the island.{{sfn|Sitney|1990|p=131}}\n\nBergman appealed to filmmaker [[Kenne Fant]] for funding for the project. Supportive, Fant asked about the film's concept and Bergman shared his vision of women comparing hands. Fant assumed that the film would be inexpensive, and agreed to fund it.{{sfn|Bergman|2014|p=27}} In his book ''Images'', Bergman wrote, \"Today I feel that in ''Persona''\u2014and later in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]''\u2014I had gone as far as I could go. And that in these two instances when working in total freedom, I touched wordless secrets that only the cinema can discover.\" He also said, \"At some time or other, I said that ''Persona'' saved my life\u2014that is no exaggeration.

Then Bergman decided that each angle communicated something important and used both in their entirety, one after the other.{{sfn|Long|2006|p=5}}\n\nBergman was unhappy with the sound in the scene where Alma describes the orgy, so he told Andersson to reread the scene, which she did in a lower voice.

Werle described his effort to meet Bergman's requests without a description of the scenes Werle would score:\n{{blockquote|Then he came with vague hints about how the films would look, but I understood him anyway and he gave me some keywords ... I was a little surprised to be part of an artistic work that I had so little time to digest ...

Besides ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', it is probably the most written-about film in the canon\". Critic [[Peter Cowie]] wrote, \"Everything one says about ''Persona'' may be contradicted; the opposite will also be true\". Academic Frank Gado called Cowie's assessment \"patent nonsense\", but agreed there was \"critical disarray\"; editor Lloyd Michaels said that although Cowie exaggerated somewhat, he welcomed the \"critical licence\" to study the film.{{refn|group=n|name=\"Interpretation\"}}\n\nMichaels summarized what he calls \"the most widely held view\" of ''Persona'':{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=16\u201319}} that it is \"a kind of modernist horror movie\".{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=17}} Elisabet's condition, described by a doctor as \"the hopeless dream to be\", is \"the shared condition of both life and film art\".{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=18}} Film scholar [[Marc Gervais]] has suggested several possible interpretations: \"a metaphor of the subconscious or unconscious\", \"one personality consuming the other\", \"the fusing of two personalities into one\", or \"the different sides of the same personality fleetingly merging\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=96}} Gado suggested that ''Persona'' was \"an investigation of [[schizophrenia]], a story about lesbian attraction, or a parable about the artist\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=339}}\n\nBergman said that although he had an idea of what the story meant, he would not share it because he felt that his audience should draw its own conclusions.

Singer wrote that Bergman expanded on Stevenson's exploration of duality, the \"[[good and evil]], light and dark aspects of our nature\", depicting it as \"oneness\" in the shot.{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=164}}\n\nGado saw ''Persona'' as a \"double-threaded process of discovery involving motherhood\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=342}} Elisabet's withdrawal into silence could be her rejection of motherhood, the only role the actress could not slough off. The nurse realizes that she has done what Elisabet tried and failed to do: erase a child from her life by abortion.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=343}} Psychiatrist Barbara Young viewed the boy in the morgue in the film's prologue as a stand-in for Bergman, in a morgue he remembered, reaching out to his mother.

Bergman agreed, saying that Jung's theory \"fits well in this case\".{{sfn|Denzin|1992|p=28}} Coates also connected masks to themes of identity and duality: \"The mask is [[Janus]]-faced\".{{sfn|Coates|2012|pp=158\u2013172}}\n\nAlma's secret is revealed in her orgy monologue, and critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] related it to a combination of shame and nostalgia perhaps indicating the character's [[sexual liberation]].

By depicting this tension as experienced primarily by women, Bergman may be said to \"problematize the position of woman as other\"; the role society assigns women is \"essentially foreign to their subjecthood\".{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=135}} Blackwell wrote that the attraction between Elisabet and Alma and the absence of male sexuality cohere with their identification with each other, creating a doubling that reveals the \"multiple, shifting, self-contradictory identity\" (a notion of identity that undermines male ideology). The theme of merging and doubling surfaces early in the film, when Alma says that she saw one of Elisabet's films and was struck by the thought that they were alike.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=151}} Blackwell also writes that one of the film's original titles, ''A Piece of Cinematography'', may allude to the nature of representation.{{sfn|Blackwell|1997|p=134}}\n\nAnalysts have noted possible lesbian under-{{sfn|Michaels|2000|p=5}} and overtones.{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=96}} Alison Darren profiled ''Persona'' in her ''Lesbian Film Guide'', calling Alma and Elisabet's relationship \"halfway between love and hate\"; they may come close to having sex in one scene, \"though this might easily be an illusion\".{{sfn|Darren|2000|p=164}} Scholar [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]] interpreted the film in [[Feminist theory|feminist]] terms as a depiction of [[lesbian films|lesbianism]], viewing the scene where Elisabet enters Alma's room as seduction.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=138}} Professor Alexis Luko also felt that the characters' touching and resemblance in the scene, in addition to symbolizing their personalities merging, indicated intimacy and eroticism.{{sfn|Luko|2015|p=140}}\n\nFoster believed that Elisabet's gaze presents Alma with questions about her engagement to Karl-Henrik.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=135}} According to Foster, sexual encounters between men and women are associated with abortion; lesbian romance has an increasingly shared identity.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} But if ''Persona'' dramatizes a lesbian relationship, it is not clearly favorable, as it is later characterized by narcissism and violence.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=137}} If lesbianism is considered a stronger version of female friendship, or motherly love, Alma and Elisabet's relationship replaces the depiction of the [[Oedipus complex]] in the prologue when the boy reaches for his mother in vain.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=134}} According to Jeremi Szaniawski, Bergman's use of [[homoeroticism]] (gay and lesbian) in ''Persona'', ''[[Hour of the Wolf]]'', ''Cries and Whispers'' and ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]'' was a rebellion against his strict upbringing by [[Church of Sweden]] minister [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik Bergman]].{{sfn|Szaniawski|2013|p=151}}\n[[File:Tragic mask of terra cotta, with the mouth wide open, representing the \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf, or persona, of the ancients - Dodwell Edward - 1819.jpg|200px|thumb|alt=Front and side views of a tragic mask|[[Edward Dodwell]]'s depiction of an ancient Greek mask]]\n\n===Art and theatre===\n''[[Persona]]'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for \"mask\" and referred to a mouthpiece actors wore to increase the audibility of their lines.

According to T\u00f6rnqvist, Elisabet makes a fist, symbolizing her revolt against the notion of meaningful performance.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|2003|p=207}} Singer concluded that although Elisabet develops a very personal relationship with Alma, she cannot shed her ''persona'' as an actress and will remain lonely with \"the hopeless dream of being\".{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=172}}\n\n[[File:Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c self-immolation.jpg|200px|left|thumb|alt=See caption|Journalist [[Malcolm Browne]]'s photograph of [[Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c]]'s [[self-immolation]], which [[Carsten Jensen]] said is related to ''Persona''{{'s}} themes.]]\nAccording to Singer, Bergman confronts his viewers with \"the nature of his art form\".{{sfn|Singer|2009|p=171}} Literary critic Maria Bergom-Larsson wrote that ''Persona'' reflected Bergman's approach to filmmaking.
