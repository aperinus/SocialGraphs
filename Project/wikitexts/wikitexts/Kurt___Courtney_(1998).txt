Broomfield interviews Tom Grant, a [[private investigator]] who has alleged that Love may have conspired to kill her husband,<ref name=\"Billboard\"/> and wants the case re-opened by the Seattle Police Department. Grant was hired by Love, but thinks it was just so people would believe that she was innocent.<ref name=\"Decider\"/> Hank Harrison, Courtney Love's father, is interviewed, and states he also believes that Cobain may have been killed in a conspiracy organised by Love.
