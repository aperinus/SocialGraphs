It  was theatrically released on September 21, 1984, by [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Benton's screenplay and direction and performances of the cast (particularly of Field, Malkovich and Crouse), while the film grossed $34.9 million against a $9.5 million budget. The film received seven nominations at the [[57th Academy Awards]] including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Field), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1935 in [[Waxahachie, Texas|Waxahachie]], [[Texas]], a small town in the grip of the [[Great Depression]]. One Sunday afternoon, the sheriff, Royce Spalding, goes to investigate gun shots at the rail yards. A cheerfully drunk black teenager, Wylie, is firing a revolver. He reaches an empty chamber and, thinking the gun is empty, he aims at the sheriff, killing him.  Royce's body is brought home to his widow, Edna, and their children. A truckload of vigilantes drags Wylie's body behind them, stopping in front of the Spalding house. Later, Wylie's friends take his body down from a tree. The two men are buried on the same day.\n\nEdna must now raise her children alone. She is comforted by her sister, Margaret, who helps with the funeral. A drifter and handyman, a black man named Moses \u201cMoze\u201d Hadner appears at her door the night of the funeral, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on her 40 acres, citing his  experience. Edna feeds him and sends him on his way. The next morning, she finds him chopping wood in her yard. She makes him breakfast. Moze steals some silver spoons and goes.\n\nThe bank has a note on the family farm, and the price for cotton is plummeting. The local banker, Albert Denby, insists she needs to sell the farm.\n\nWhen the police find Moze with her silver, they bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna says she has hired him and explains the spoons. The next day, Edna tells Denby she will not sell the farm. He is appalled that she is taking advice from a black man. Later, he visits the farm and forces her to take his brother-in-law, Will, blinded in [[World War I]], as a paid lodger. Will is slow to warm up to Edna's children, but they eventually become close. He rescues her daughter, Possum, during a tornado that levels part of town but leaves the Spalding house standing.\n\nWayne Lomax, Edna's brother-in-law, has a fine time making love to married schoolteacher Viola Kelsey. The tornado is the last straw for Viola, who tells her husband they must move. Wayne admits the affair to Margaret. She says she won't forgive him this time.\n\nEdna realizes she cannot make the next payment even if she sells all her cotton. She learns of an [[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis County]] contest: a $100 cash prize to the farmer who produces the first bale of cotton for market each season. Edna realizes the prize money plus the proceeds from the sale of her cotton would be enough to save the farm. Moze helps her find the pickers they need to harvest the cotton on time.\n\nTheir efforts pay off. Edna and Moze find themselves first in line at the wholesaler with the season's first bale of cotton. Moze carefully coaches Edna on how to negotiate with the buyer, and as a result he is unable to cheat her. Edna makes plans for the future.  Moze is excited, but that  night, he is accosted by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members. Wielding Frank's gun, Will interrupts the savage beating. He recognizes all the assailants' voices and identifies them. They leave.  Weeping, Moze realizes he must leave the farm or die. He gives Edna a handkerchief that belonged to his mother.\n\nThe film's ending moves into a spiritual realm, evoking [[Communion of saints|Holy Communion]]. A choir sings in the modest church, where the pews are mostly empty. During a reading of [[1 Corinthians 13]], Margaret takes Wayne's hand. The congregation\u2014after filling the pews\u2014partakes in [[Protestant]] communion, passing the elements of the ritual to each other and the choir sings \u201c[[In the Garden (1912 song)|In the Garden]]\u201d. The camera shows townspeople in the pews who were seen throughout the film, including a woman who died when the tornado overturned her car. Eventually, Moze is shown in the church, long fled; the camera then shows Edna, who passes a communion tray to her dead husband, quietly saying \u201cPeace of God\u201d; with the same blessing, he hands it to Wylie, who shot him and was also shot dead. After Wylie replies, \u201cPeace of God\u201d, the camera lingers on the two men in contemplation as the hymn ends and before the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sally Field]] as Edna Spalding\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Margaret Lomax\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Moses \"Moze\" Hadner\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Mr. Will\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Wayne Lomax\n* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Sheriff Royce Spalding\n* [[Amy Madigan]] as Viola Kelsey\n* Yankton Hatten as Frank Spalding\n* [[Gennie James]] as Possum Spalding\n* [[Lane Smith]] as Albert Denby (banker)\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Buddy Kelsey\n* [[Bert Remsen]] as Tee Tot Hightower\n* [[Jay Patterson]] as W.E.
