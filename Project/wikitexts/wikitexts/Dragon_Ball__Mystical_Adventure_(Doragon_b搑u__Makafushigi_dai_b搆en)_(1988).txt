It was released in on July 9, 1988 at the \"Toei Manga Matsuri\" film festival as part of a quadruple feature along with ''[[Bikkuriman|Bikkuriman 2: The Secret of Muen Zone]]'', ''[[Tatakae!! Ramenman]]'', and ''[[Kamen Rider Black|Kamen Rider Black: Terrifying! The Phantom House of Devil Pass]]''.\n\nUnlike the previous two ''Dragon Ball'' films, ''Mystical Adventure'' does not introduce any original characters, but instead adapts characters from the Red Ribbon Army and 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament story arcs from the manga into the film's original storyline.\n\n==Plot==\nAnother retelling of the Dragon Ball story. This time, young [[Son Goku (Dragon Ball)|Goku]] and young [[Kuririn|Krillin]] are training with [[Muten Roshi|Master Roshi]] for a World Martial Arts Tournament to be held in the country of Mifan. The Emperor of Mifan, [[Chaozu|Chiaotzu]], is trying to find his lost \"Ran Ran.\" \"Minister\" Master Shen has [[Emperor Pilaf]] work on a Dragon Radar, takes it from him, and is using it to locate the Dragon Balls. Shen and [[Taopaipai|Mercenary Tao]] claim that they will use the wish from [[Shenlong|Shenron]] to locate Ran Ran, but are actually planning, with [[Tenshinhan|Tien]]'s help, to kill Chiaotzu and take over the country. General Blue announces that Ran Ran is being held in Shen's room, and is killed by Tao for it. Bora and Upa have located the final Dragon Ball and they take it to Mifan to use it to demand that Mifan's soldiers be forced to leave the land near Korin Tower.\n\nBora is tricked into entering the Tournament (the winner of the Tournament will be granted one wish by Chiaotzu), and is then killed by Tao. [[Bulma]], [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]], [[Lunch (Dragon Ball)|Launch]] and [[List of Earthlings in Dragon Ball#Pu-erh|Puar]] are looking for the other six Dragon Balls, so Bulma can wish for a boyfriend. However, when the Dragon Balls are located, they are accidentally dropped to the bottom of the moat surrounding Chiaotzu castle. Tien realizes that he likes Chiaotzu too much, and does not kill his friend; instead, he blows away Shen. Then he gives Chiaotzu back Ran Ran (actually a porcelain doll, not a real girl) telling him he had hidden her because of Shen and Tao. The story of Blue and Goku entering Penguin village is included, but this time it is Tao and Goku that meet [[Arale]] and Goku kills Tao with Arale's help. Goku throws the final ball into the moat, and summons Shenron, whom Upa asks to resurrect Bora.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese\n! colspan=\"4\" | English\n|-\n! <small>Intersound, Inc./[[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] (1989)</small>\n!<small>Creative Products Corp.

It was also likely to have been released on [[home video]] in the early 90s. It was not widely noticed and went under the radar. Their dub changed the names of some of the characters and had parts of it censored, and the opening and ending sequence changed with; instead of the first Japanese sequence they used the second Japanese sequence, with the Japanese katakana removed from the Dragon Balls, the Japanese credits removed and replaced with the Harmony Gold credits, and they changed some of the dialog from the Japanese intro. The ending was changed from the Japanese ending to show a still picture of Goku flying away from Shenron (known as Dragon God in the [[Harmony Gold USA|Harmony Gold]] dub) taken from the intro, and using the intro theme song instead of the Japanese ending theme with the Harmony Gold credits. The script was more faithful to the Japanese script and all the background music was kept the same, unlike the [[Funimation]] and [[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] dubs.\n\nThere was also another English dub released exclusively to [[Video CD]] by Speedy Video. This English version, produced and released exclusively in [[Malaysia]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nyaa.si/view/1073029|title = &#91;TADA&#93; Dragon Ball movies (1987 - 1995) Malaysian-English Dubbed; Movies 2 & 3 (Dragon Ball) and Movies 1 - 13 (Dragon Ball Z)}}</ref> features an unknown cast and original music.\n\nFunimation acquired the rights to the film in 2000 and released it with a new dub to VHS and bilingual DVD that year.\n\n[[Madman Entertainment]] released the film on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on March 17, 2004 with the 2000 English dub and optional Japanese audio. However, the introduction, which began the narration of the Dragon Balls, a cameo sequence of Pilaf and his gang presenting a global dragon radar to Master Shen, and a different opening sequence to the film featuring Goku and Krillin in training were cut. Instead, the opening sequence and scenes aforementioned were replaced with the TV opening sequence. Another sequence cut was the closing credits featuring a summoned Shenron who fulfilled Upa's wish to bring Bora back to life. The scene was replaced with the TV closing sequence.\n\nSubsequent versions of the FUNimation dub had restored its introduction and its opening/ending sequence. Unlike the Japanese version however, the opening sequence had many scenes in [[Freeze frame shot|freeze-frame]], as a way to block out the original Japanese credits that were in the sequence. The closing credits was restored with English credits censoring half the screen, also as a way to block out the original Japanese credits scrolling from the right.\n\nThe film was later available on DVD along with ''Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle'' and ''Path to Power'' as part of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Movie Box set released on December 6, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BKDNRQ|title=Dragon Ball Movie 2, 3, 4|date=6 December 2005|via=Amazon}}</ref> The box set was re-released as a thinpack on February 12, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010YSD3G|title=Dragon Ball Movie 3-pack|date=12 February 2008|via=Amazon}}</ref> This set has since been discontinued.\n\nThe film was re-released to DVD in America on February 8, 2011 as a part of a ''Dragon Ball Movie 4-Pack'' remastered thinpack release from FUNimation along with the other Dragon Ball related films.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/3p6r0ZuInJGK5jvDN4/browse/item/90030/4/0/0 |title=Dragon Ball Movie Complete Collection DVD (Hyb) Remastered |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201080629/http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/3p6r0ZuInJGK5jvDN4/browse/item/90030/4/0/0 |archive-date=1 February 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This release restored all of the previously edited video footage of the film, but no apparent English credits are shown.\n\nAn alternative English dub produced with an uncredited cast by AB Groupe in France was released in English speaking markets in Europe in the early 2000s.
