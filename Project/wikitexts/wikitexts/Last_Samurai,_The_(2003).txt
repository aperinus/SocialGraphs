The film stars [[Ken Watanabe]] in the title role, with [[Tom Cruise]], who also co-produced, as a soldier-turned-samurai who befriends him, and [[Timothy Spall]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]], [[Koyuki]], and [[Shin Koyamada]] in supporting roles.\n\nTom Cruise portrays an American captain of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]], whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him into contact with [[samurai]] warriors in the wake of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in [[Empire of Japan|19th century Japan]]. The film's plot was inspired by the 1877 [[Satsuma Rebellion]] led by [[Saig\u014d Takamori]], and the [[Westernization]] of Japan by foreign powers, though in the film the United States is portrayed as the primary force behind the push for Westernization. It is also influenced by the stories of [[Jules Brunet]], a [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon III)|French Imperial Guard]] [[sub-lieutenant]] who fought alongside [[Enomoto Takeaki]] in the earlier [[Boshin War]]; [[Philip Kearny]], a [[United States Army]] ([[Union Army]]) [[Major general (United States)|major general]] and [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon III)|French Imperial Guard]] soldier, notable for his leadership in the [[American Civil War]], who fought against the [[Tututni]] tribe in the [[Rogue River Wars]] in [[Oregon]]; and, to a lesser extent, by [[Frederick Townsend Ward]], an American mercenary who helped [[Westernize]] the Chinese army by forming the [[Ever Victorious Army]].\n\n''The Last Samurai'' grossed a total of $456 million<ref name=\"BOM\" /> at the box office and received positive reviews, with praise for the acting, visuals and score but criticism for some of its portrayals. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and two [[National Board of Review|National Board of Review Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are usually 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1876, former [[U.S. Army]] Captain Nathan Algren, a bitter [[alcoholic]] traumatized by the atrocities he committed during the [[American Indian Wars]], is approached by his former commanding officer Colonel Bagley to train the newly created [[Imperial Japanese Army]] for a forward-thinking Japanese businessman, Omura, who intends to use the army to suppress [[Satsuma Rebellion|a Samurai-headed rebellion]] against Japan's new emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley for his role in the Indian Wars, an impoverished Algren takes the job for the money, and is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, [[Sergeant]] Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the samurai.\n\nAlgren finds the Imperial soldiers are little more than [[conscripted]] peasants with no discipline and shoddy training. While teaching them to shoot, Algren is informed that the samurai are attacking one of Omura's railroads; Omura sends the army there, despite Algren's protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster; the undisciplined conscripts are routed, and Gant is killed. Algren [[last stand|fights to the last]] before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when samurai leader Katsumoto decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's village. While he is poorly treated at first, he eventually gains the samurai's respect and grows close to Katsumoto. Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, learns the Japanese language and culture, and is trained in the art of [[kenjutsu]]. He develops sympathy for the samurai, who are upset that the pace of modern technology has eroded the traditions of their society. Algren and Taka, Katsumoto's sister and the widow of a samurai killed by Algren, develop an unspoken affection for each other.\n\nOne night, a group of [[ninja]] infiltrate the village and attempt to assassinate Katsumoto. Algren saves Katsumoto's life, and then helps defend the village, concluding Omura hired the ninjas. Katsumoto requests a meeting with [[Emperor Meiji]] and is given safe passage to [[Tokyo]]. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren finds the Imperial Army is now a well-trained and fully equipped fighting force. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced Emperor has essentially become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto's arrest for [[Haitorei Edict|carrying a sword in public]] and asks him to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' to redeem his honor. When Algren refuses an offer to assume command of the army, Omura sends a party of assassins after him, but Algren kills them. Algren assists the samurai in freeing Katsumoto; in the process, Katsumoto's son Nobutada is mortally wounded, sacrificing himself to allow the others to escape.\n\nAs the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates ''seppuku'', but Algren convinces him to fight until the end, and joins the samurai in battle. The samurai use the Imperial Army's overconfidence to lure them into a trap; the ensuing battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the Imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that Imperial reinforcements are coming, and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders a [[suicide attack|suicidal]] [[cavalry charge]] on horseback. The samurai withstand an artillery barrage and break through Bagley's line. Bagley is killed by Algren, but the samurai are quickly mowed down by [[Gatling gun]]s. The Imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying samurai, orders all of the guns to cease fire, disregarding Omura's orders. A mortally wounded Katsumoto commits ''seppuku'' with Algren's help as the soldiers at the scene kneel in respect.\n\nDays later, as trade negotiations conclude, Algren, though injured, arrives and interrupts the proceedings. He presents the Emperor with Katsumoto's sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai died. The Emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize, it cannot forget its own culture and history; he promptly rejects the trade offer. When Omura attempts to protest, the Emperor silences him by threatening to seize the Omura family assets and distribute them among the populace. Omura claims to be disgraced, but the Emperor responds by holding Katsumoto's sword and suggests that if the shame is too great, Omura should commit ''seppuku''. Omura relents and leaves.\n\nWhile various rumours regarding Algren's fate circulate, Graham concludes that Algren had returned to the village to reunite with Taka.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Cruise]] as Captain Nathan Algren, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[American Indian Wars|Indian War]] [[veteran]] haunted by his role in the [[Battle of Washita River|massacre of Native Americans at the Washita River]]. Following his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the [[United States Army]], he agrees to help the new [[Meiji Restoration]] [[Meiji government|government]] train its first [[Western world|Western]]-style [[Conscription|conscript]] [[army]] for a significant sum of money. During the army's first battle he is captured by the [[samurai]] Katsumoto and taken to the village of Katsumoto's son, where he soon becomes intrigued with the way of the samurai and decides to join them in their cause. His journal entries reveal his impressions about traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], which almost immediately evolve into [[Japanophilia|unrestrained admiration]]. \n*[[Ken Watanabe]] as Lord Moritsugu Katsumoto, the eponymous \"Last Samurai,\"  a former ''[[daimyo]]'' who was once Emperor Meiji's most trusted teacher. His displeasure with the influence of Omura and other Western reformers on the Emperor lead him to organize his fellow samurai in a revolt, which he hopes will convince the government not to destroy the samurai's place in Japanese society. Katsumoto is based on real-life samurai [[Saig\u014d Takamori]], who led the Satsuma Rebellion.\n*[[Koyuki|Koyuki Kato]] as Taka, widow of a samurai slain by Nathan Algren and younger sister of Lord Katsumoto. She and Algren develop feelings for each other, and she gives him her husband's armor to wear in the final battle of the rebellion.\n*[[Shin Koyamada]] as Nobutada Katsumoto, Katsumoto's son who is responsible for the village where Algren is sent. Nobutada befriends Algren when Katsumoto assigns him to teach Algren Japanese culture and the Japanese language. He dies when he willingly chooses to distract Imperial troops so his father can escape their custody.\n*[[Tony Goldwyn]] as Colonel Bagley, Nathan Algren's former commanding officer in the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]], who hires him to serve as a training instructor for the Imperial Army despite Algren's hatred of Bagley for his role in the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita River massacre]]. In contrast to Algren, Bagley is arrogant and dismissive of the samurai, at one point referring to them nothing more than \"savages with bows and arrows\". He is killed by Algren who throws a sword into his chest when Bagley tries to shoot Katsumoto in the final battle.\n*[[Masato Harada]] as Matsue Omura, an industrialist and pro-reform politician. He quickly imports [[Westernization]] and [[modernization]] while making money for himself through his ownership of Japan's railroads. Coming from a merchant family, a social class repressed during the days of Shogun rule, Omura openly expresses his contempt for the samurai and takes advantage of Emperor Meiji's youth to become his chief advisor, persuading him to form a Western-style army for the sole purpose of wiping out Katsumoto and his rebels while ignoring their grievances. His appearance is designed to evoke the image of [[Okubo Toshimichi]], a leading reformer during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Harada noted that he was deeply interested in joining the film after witnessing the construction of Emperor Meiji's conference room on [[sound stage]] 19 (where [[Humphrey Bogart]] had once acted) at Warner Brothers studios.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n*[[Nakamura Shichinosuke II|Shichinosuke Nakamura]] as [[Emperor Meiji]]. Credited with the implementation of the Meiji reforms to Japanese society, the Emperor is eager to import Western ideas and practices to modernize and empower Japan to become a strong nation. However, his inexperience causes him to rely heavily on the advice of men like Omura, who have their own agendas. His appearance bears a strong resemblance to Emperor Meiji during the 1860s (when his authority as Emperor was not yet firmly established) rather than during the 1870s, when the film takes place.\n*[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as Ujio, a master swordsman and one of Katsumoto's most trusted followers. He teaches Algren the art of sword fighting, coming to respect him as an equal. He is one of the last samurai to die in the final battle, being gunned down during Katsumoto's charge.\n*[[Timothy Spall]] as Simon Graham, a British photographer and scholar hired as an interpreter for Captain Algren and his non-English speaking soldiers. Initially portrayed as a friendly yet mission-oriented and practical-minded companion, he later comes to sympathize with the samurai cause and helps Algren rescue Katsumoto from Imperial soldiers.\n*[[Seizo Fukumoto]] as Silent Samurai, an elderly samurai tasked with monitoring Algren during his time in the village, who calls the samurai \"Bob\". \"Bob\" ultimately saves Algren's life (and speaking for the first and only time, \"Algren-san!\") by taking a bullet meant for him in the final battle.\n*[[Billy Connolly]] as Sergeant Zebulon Gant, an Irish American Civil War veteran who served with and is loyal to Algren, persuading him to come to Japan and working with him to train the Imperial Army. During the first battle, he is killed by Hirotaro (Taka's husband) after being wounded with a spear.\n*[[Shun Sugata]] as Nakao, a tall samurai who wields a [[naginata]] and is skilled in [[jujutsu]]. He assists Algren in rescuing Katsumoto and dies along with the other samurai in the final battle.\n\n== Production ==\n{{One source section\n| date = August 2022\n}}\nFilming took place in New Zealand, mostly in the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki region]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Last Samurai Filming Locations {{!}} New Zealand |url=https://www.newzealand.com/nz/feature/the-last-samurai-filming-locations/ |access-date=2022-08-11 |website=www.newzealand.com |language=en-NZ}}</ref> with Japanese cast members and an American production crew. This location was chosen due to the fact that [[Mount Taranaki|Egmont/Mount Taranaki]] resembles [[Mount Fuji]], and also because there is a lot of forest and farmland in the Taranaki region. American Location Manager Charlie Harrington saw the mountain in a travel book and encouraged the producers to send him to Taranaki to scout the locations. This acted as a backdrop for many scenes, as opposed to the built up cities of Japan. Several of the village scenes were shot on the [[Warner Bros. Studios]] [[backlot]] in Burbank, California. Some scenes were shot in [[Kyoto]] and [[Himeji]], Japan. There were 13 filming locations altogether. Tom Cruise did his own [[stunts]] for the film.\n\nThe film is based on an original screenplay entitled \"The Last Samurai\", from a story by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]. The project itself was inspired by writer and director [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]]. Ward became [[executive producer]] on the film \u2013 working in development on it for nearly four years and after approaching several directors ([[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Peter Weir]]), until he became interested with [[Edward Zwick]]. The film production went ahead with Zwick and was shot in Ward's native New Zealand.\n\nThe film was based on the stories of [[Jules Brunet]], a [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon III)|French Imperial Guard]] [[sub-lieutenant]] who fought alongside [[Enomoto Takeaki]] in the earlier [[Boshin War]]; [[Philip Kearny]], a [[United States Army]] ([[Union Army]]) and [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon III)|French Imperial Guard]] soldier, notable for his leadership in the [[American Civil War]], who fought against the [[Tututni]] tribe in the [[Rogue River Wars]] in [[Oregon]]; and [[Frederick Townsend Ward]], an American [[mercenary]] who helped [[Westernization|Westernize]] the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] army by forming the [[Ever Victorious Army]]. The historical roles of other European nations who were involved in the [[westernization]] of Japan are largely attributed to the United States in the film, although the film references European involvement as well.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[Hans Zimmer]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 25, 2003\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 59:41\n| label      = [[Warner Sunset Records|Warner Sunset]]\n| producer   = Hans Zimmer\n| prev_title = [[Matchstick Men#Soundtrack|Matchstick Men]]\n| prev_year  = 2003\n| next_title = [[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]\n| next_year  = 2003\n}}\n\n'''''The Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score''''' was released on November 25, 2003, by [[Warner Sunset Records]].<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Last Samurai: Original Motion Picture Score |others=[[Hans Zimmer]] |year=2003 |type=CD liner notes |publisher=Warner Sunset Records}}</ref> All music on the soundtrack was composed, arranged, and produced by [[Hans Zimmer]], performed by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]], and conducted by [[Blake Neely]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\">[https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-last-samurai-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000328630 \"''The Last Samurai'' \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\"].

He was opposed to the excessively rapid changes in Japanese society and was particularly disturbed by the shabby treatment of the warrior class.\" Suspicious of the new bureaucracy, he wanted power to remain in the hands of the samurai class and the Emperor, and for those reasons, he had joined the central government. \"Edicts like the interdiction against carrying swords and wearing the traditional topknot seemed like a series of gratuitous provocations; and, though Saig\u014d realized that Japan needed an effective standing army to resist pressure from the West, he could not countenance the social implications of the military reforms. For this reason Saig\u014d, although participating in the [[Okinoerabu]] government, continued to exercise a powerful appeal among disgruntled ex-samurai in [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and elsewhere.\" Saig\u014d fought for a moral revolution, not a material one, and he described his revolt as a check on the declining morality of a new, Westernizing materialism.<ref>Ivan Morris (1975), ''The Nobility of Failure: Tragic Heroes in the History of japanese'', chapter 9, Saig\u014d Takamori.
