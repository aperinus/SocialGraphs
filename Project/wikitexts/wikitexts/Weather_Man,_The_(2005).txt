It tells the story of a [[Weather forecasting|weatherman]] in the midst of a [[mid-life crisis]].\n\nThe film was released on October 28, 2005, and grossed $19 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nA successful [[Weather forecasting|weatherman]] at a [[Chicago]] [[news program]], David Spritz ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is well paid but garners little respect from people in the area who throw [[fast food]] at him, David suspects, because they're resentful of how easy his high-paying job is.  Dave also feels overshadowed by his father, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author Robert Spritzel ([[Michael Caine]]), who is disappointed in Dave's apparent inability to grow up and deal with his two children.  The situation worsens when Robert is diagnosed with [[lymphoma]] and given only a few months to live.  As he becomes more and more [[dysthymia|depressed]], Dave takes up [[archery]], finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves.\n\nDavid later remembers a conversation between himself and his father, where his father explains to him that \"the harder thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same thing\" and that \"nothing that has meaning is easy\". David appreciates this advice but struggles to implement it.\n\nTo prove himself to his father and possibly reconcile with Noreen ([[Hope Davis]]), his estranged wife, Dave pursues a weatherman position with a national talk show called ''Hello America''. The job would nearly quadruple his salary, but means relocating to [[New York City]].  When ''Hello America'' invites him to New York, he takes his daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pe\u00f1a), with him and bonds with her by helping her shop for a more suitable wardrobe.  While away, Dave learns that his son Mike ([[Nicholas Hoult]]) attacked his [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselor]], Don Bowden ([[Gil Bellows]]), claiming that the man wanted to perform [[Fellatio|oral sex]] on him.  Despite this stress and an all-night drinking binge, Dave impresses the ''Hello America'' interviewers and is eventually offered the job.\n\nWhen he returns, Dave slaps Russ ([[Michael Rispoli]]), Noreen's boyfriend, when he finds him dealing with his son's predicament. Dave later confronts the counselor at his home, beating him up and warning him that he is in store for worse.\n\nThe family holds a [[living funeral]] for Robert (organised by Dave's mother, Lauren, played by [[Judith McConnell]]), in which Dave asks Noreen to reconcile and move to New York, but she has decided to marry Russ. Dave and Robert have one final talk, in which Dave breaks down in tears, unsure of his life's choices. Robert consoles him, telling him that he has time to \"chuck\" the garbage of his life. Robert dies soon after.\n\nThe film ends several months later, after Dave has accepted the job and moved to New York.  People have ceased throwing things at him though, he muses, this may be a pleasant side-effect of his archery hobby, for which he carries a bow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as David Spritz (real name David Spritzel)\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Robert Spritzel \n* [[Hope Davis]] as Noreen\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Mike Spritzel\n* Gemmenne de la Pe\u00f1a as Shelly Spritzel\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Russ\n* [[Gil Bellows]] as Don Bowden\n* [[Judith McConnell]] as Lauren Spritzel\n* [[Tom Skilling]] as WGN Assistant Director\n\nThe film also includes [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s from [[news presenter]]s, such as [[Bryant Gumbel]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Cristina Ferrare]], and [[Wolfgang Puck]].\n\n==Reception==\n''The Weather Man'' received an overall score of 59% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and has an average rating of 6.1/10 based on 136 reviews.
