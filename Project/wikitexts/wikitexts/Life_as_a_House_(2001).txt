Over the years, George has been avoiding getting up to modern [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] technology standards and eventually is fired from the architecture firm. When the principal owner refuses to let George keep a few of his models, he destroys all but one of the models with a roll of design plans. As he exits the building with the remaining model, he collapses and is rushed to the hospital, where it is revealed he has advanced stage [[cancer]] and any treatment would be futile.\n\nGeorge, with a time limit on his life, decides to demolish the shack left to him by his father and build his own custom house. He enlists his son, Sam, who is [[parental alienation|alienated]] from his stepfather Peter and his mother Robin, who has since been remarried to a wealthy investor. Sam is forced to spend his summer with George, who has not revealed his terminal condition, and help him with the house. Initially, Sam makes it a point not to help George demo the old house. When George refuses to give Sam money unless he works for it, Sam toys with becoming a prostitute, but is nearly caught and flees from his first encounter. This leads him to steal George's [[Vicodin]].\n\nGeorge slowly reconnects with Sam. Robin decides to assist as well, and she finds herself rediscovering George. Also joining in the construction are Alyssa, Sam's classmate who lives next door with her mother Colleen; local policeman Kurt Walker, George's childhood friend; Sam's young half-brothers Adam and Ryan; various neighbors; and eventually Peter, even after separating from Robin when she tells him that her feelings for George have re-awakened. George tells Robin of his disease, sending her into shock. George tells Sam, who feels betrayed and accuses George of being selfish and takes refuge at Alyssa's house. George collapses and is found by Robin the following morning. Complications arise when neighbor David Dokos tries to halt construction because the building's height exceeds the allowable limit by six inches. His plans to halt the project are stopped by Sam, who recognizes him from his [[prostitution]] attempt and blackmails him.\n\nSam puts Christmas lights all over the unfinished house and shows George the gleaming house from his hospital window. The next morning, Sam returns to finish the house and Robin sits beside George until his death. Robin goes to the house and tells Sam about his father's death. Sam inherits the house he finished building.  Sam gives the property to a woman who has been living in a trailer park.  As a girl, she was injured in a car crash caused by his grandfather.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as George Monroe\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Robin Kimball\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] as Sam Monroe\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Alyssa Beck\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Colleen Beck\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Peter Kimball\n* [[Ian Somerhalder]] as Josh\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Kurt Walker\n* [[Sam Robards]] as David Dokos \n* [[John Pankow]] as Bryan Burke \n* Mike Weinberg as Adam Kimball\n* [[Scotty Leavenworth]] as Ryan Kimball\n\n==Production==\nIn ''Character Building: Inside Life as a House'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, director Irwin Winkler confesses he never realized the rekindling love between George and Robin was a key aspect of the script until he saw the emotion displayed by [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] in their scenes together. Winkler encouraged his cast to improvise moments leading into and following their scripted dialogue, many of which were included in the final film.<ref>[[Irwin Winkler|Winkler, Irwin]], et al. \"Character Building: Inside Life as a House.\" ([[Featurette]]) DVD.

Because the film tracked the progress of the dismantling of the old house and the construction of the new one, it had to be shot in sequence.
