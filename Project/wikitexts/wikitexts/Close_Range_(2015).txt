The film follows Colton MacReady, a rogue soldier-turned-outlaw, who is forced to protect his sister and young niece from a corrupt sheriff and a dangerous drug cartel who descend upon his ranch for revenge.<ref name=AdkinsRelease/>\n\nThe film premiered on Polish television on September 16, 2015. It received a limited theatrical release and [[Video on demand|VOD]] release in the United States on December 4, followed by a home video release on January 5, 2016.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[Sonora]], Mexico, former soldier and now outlaw Colt Macready rescues his niece, Hailey, who was kidnapped by drug cartel leader Fernando \"El Jefe\" Garcia. After that, Colt retrieves a flash drive and they head home to Santa Cruz County, [[Arizona]]. Corrupt sheriff Jasper Calloway, who works for Garcia, receives a call from him ordering Jasper to detain Colt and his brother-in-law, Walt Reynolds, for stealing money from Garcia and he also saying that Colt killed his men. Garcia and his men depart Mexico to get Colt.\n\nWhen the sheriffs arrive at Walt's residence, Colt quickly hides in the bunkhouse. Jasper then detains Walt and asks Colt's sister Angela for Colt's whereabouts. Walt says that Colt is hiding in the bunkhouse, but Colt escapes in Walt's car and the sheriffs chase him. Garcia and his men eventually arrive at the residence. Upon arriving, Garcia coldly shoots Walt in the head after he apologizes to him for what he did. Garcia then has his men, Reina and Cruz, search Colt to recover the flash drive. Garcia's men hold Angela and her daughter Hailey hostage inside their house. Meanwhile, the sheriffs catch Colt but are killed by Reina and Cruz. After the gunfight, Colt manages to kill them both. Shortly afterward, he is intercepted by other men, Lobo and Aguillar. He manages to kill Aguillar and he interrogates Lobo about the contents of the flash drive which is information about Garcia's bank accounts. Colt then kills him and races back to the residence.\n\nAfter observing Jasper drive away from the residence, Colt kills one of the henchmen. When Garcia learns his men are dead, he threatens to kill Hailey if Colt does not surrender. Colt manages to overpower Garcia's men, and a lengthy shootout between them ensues. Hailey calls the state police for help but the operator redirects to Jasper, and Angela is injured in the process while Colt managed to kill the remaining men. Colt orders Angela and Hailey to escape from the house, but they are caught by Garcia. However, Jasper appears and kills Garcia. Colt shoots Jasper and gives him a choice: a handcuff or a shotgun. When Jasper chooses the shotgun, Colt quickly kills him. Afterwards, Colt hands the flash drive to Angela and drives away as the state police arrive.\n\n==Cast and Characters==\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Colton MacReady, a rogue soldier-turned-outlaw, who is forced to protect his sister and young niece from a corrupt sheriff and a dangerous drug cartel who descend upon his ranch for revenge.\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Sheriff Jasper Calloway, the corrupt sheriff of [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona]] police department who secretly works for Fernando Garcia.\n* [[Jake La Botz]] as Walt Reynolds, Colton's criminal brother-in-law.\n* [[Tony Perez (actor)|Tony Perez]] as Fernando Garcia (aka \"El Jefe\"), a powerful [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Drug lord|drug kingpin]] and [[Drug cartel|cartel]] leader, founder and head/leader of Garcia Cartel (one of the most powerful, dangerous and violent drug cartels in Mexico).
