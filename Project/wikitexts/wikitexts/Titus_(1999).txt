Starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Jessica Lange]], it was the directorial debut of [[Julie Taymor]], who co-produced with Jody Patton and Conchita Airoldi, and wrote the screenplay. The film was a co-production of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy; produced by Overseas Filmgroup and Clear Blue Sky Productions and released by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nA boy eating lunch in a 1950s-style kitchen plays war with his surrounding toys. A bomb blast outside the window frightens him under the table from where he is rescued and taken to an [[Amphitheatre]], where an invisible audience cheers. An army resembling the [[Terracotta Army]] enters; Romans under the command of [[Titus Andronicus (character)|Titus Andronicus]], the general at the center of the play, return victorious from war. They bring back as spoils Tamora, Queen of the Goths, her sons, and Aaron the [[Moors|Moor]]. Titus sacrifices Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, so the spirits of his 21 dead sons might be appeased. Tamora eloquently begs for the life of Alarbus, but Titus refuses her plea.\n\nCaesar, the Emperor of Rome, dies. His sons Saturninus and Bassianus squabble over who will succeed him. The [[Tribune]] of the People, Marcus Andronicus, announces the people's choice for new emperor is his brother, Titus. He refuses the throne and hands it to the late emperor's eldest son Saturninus, much to the latter's delight. The new emperor states he will take Lavinia, Titus' daughter, as his [[bride]], to honor and elevate the family. She is already betrothed to Saturninus' brother, Bassianus, who steals her away. Titus' surviving sons aid in the couple's run for the Pantheon, where they are to marry. Titus, angry with his sons because in his eyes they're being disloyal to Rome, kills his son Mutius as he defends the escape. The new emperor, Saturninus, dishonors Titus and marries Tamora instead. Tamora persuades the Emperor to feign forgiveness to Bassianus, Titus and his family and postpone punishment to a later day, thereby revealing her intention to avenge herself on all the Andronici.\n\nDuring a hunting party the next day, Tamora's lover, Aaron the Moor, meets Tamora's sons Chiron and Demetrius. The two argue over which should take sexual advantage of the newly-wed Lavinia. Aaron easily persuades them to ambush Bassianus and kill him in the presence of Tamora and Lavinia, in order to have their way with her. Lavinia begs Tamora to stop her sons, but Tamora refuses. Chiron and Demetrius throw Bassianus' body in a pit, as Aaron directed them, then take Lavinia away and rape her. To keep her from revealing what she saw and endured, they cut out her tongue as well as her hands, replacing them with tree branches. When Marcus discovers her, he begs her to reveal the identity of her assailants; Lavinia leans towards the camera and opens her bloodied mouth in a silent scream.\n\nAaron frames Titus' sons Martius and Quintus and for the murder of Bassianus with a forged letter outlining their plan to kill him. Angry, the Emperor arrests them. Later on, Marcus takes Lavinia to her father, who's overcome with grief. He and his remaining son Lucius begged for the lives of Martius and Quintus, but the two are found guilty and are marched off to execution. Aaron enters, and tells Titus, Lucius, and Marcus the emperor will spare the prisoners if one of the three sacrifices a hand. Each demands the right to do so. Titus has Aaron cut off his (Titus's) left hand and take it to the emperor. Aaron's story is revealed to have been false, as a messenger brings Titus the heads of his sons and his own severed hand. In Renaissance semiotics, the hand is a representation of political and personal agency.  With his hand chopped off, Titus has truly lost power.<ref>\"Dismembering and Forgetting in Titus Andronicus\", by Katherine A. Rowe, Shakespeare Quarterly, 45.3 (Autumn 1994), pp. 279-303</ref>  Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Goths.\n\nTitus' grandson (Lucius' son and the boy from the opening), who helped Titus read to Lavinia, complains she will not leave his books alone. In the book, she indicates to Titus and Marcus the story of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]], in which a similarly mute victim \"wrote\" the name of her wrongdoer. Marcus gives her a stick to hold with her mouth and stumps. She writes the names of her attackers on the ground. Titus vows revenge. Feigning madness, he ties written prayers for justice to arrows and commands his kinsmen to aim them at the sky so they may reach the gods. Understanding the method in Titus' \"madness\", Marcus directs the arrows to land inside the palace of Saturninus, who is enraged by this added to the fact Lucius is at the gates of Rome with an army of Goths.\n\nTamora delivers a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. To hide his affair from the Emperor, Aaron kills the nurse and flees with the baby. Lucius, marching on Rome with an army of Goths, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. To save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire plot to Lucius, relishing every murder, rape and dismemberment.\n\nTamora, convinced of Titus' [[Insanity|madness]], approaches him along with her two sons, dressed as the spirits of [[Revenge]], [[Murder]], and [[Rape]]. She tells Titus she (as a supernatural spirit) will grant him revenge if he will convince Lucius to stop attacking Rome. Titus agrees, sending Marcus to invite Lucius to a feast. \"Revenge\" offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora and is about to leave, but Titus insists \"Rape\" and \"Murder\" stay with him. She agrees. When she leaves, Titus' servants bind Chiron and Demetrius. Titus cuts their throats, while Lavinia holds a basin with her stumps to catch their blood. He plans to [[Cannibalism|cook them into]] a pie for their mother.\n\nThe next day, during the feast at his house, Lavinia enters the dining room. Titus asks Saturninus whether a father should kill his daughter if she is raped. When the Emperor agrees, Titus snaps Lavinia's neck, to the horror of the dinner guests, and tells Saturninus what Tamora's sons did. When Saturninus demands Chiron and Demetrius be brought before him, Titus reveals they were in the pie Tamora enjoyed, and kills Tamora. Saturninus kills Titus after which Lucius kills Saturninus to avenge his father's death.\n\nBack in the Roman Arena, Lucius tells his family's story to the people and is proclaimed Emperor. He orders his father Titus and sister Lavinia to be buried in the family monuments, Saturninus be given a proper burial, Tamora's body to be thrown to the wild beasts, and Aaron be buried chest-deep and left to die of thirst and starvation. Aaron is unrepentant to the end. Young Lucius picks up Aaron's child and carries him away into the sunrise.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Titus Andronicus (character)|Titus Andronicus]], victorious Roman General who declines a nomination for Emperor upon his return to Rome.

One of the experimental concepts in the film was that the character of Young Lucius (Titus' grandson) is initially introduced as a boy from the present who finds himself transported to the fantastical reality of the film. At the beginning of the film, his toy soldiers turn into Titus' Roman army. At the end, when Titus' son Lucius avenges his father by condemning the villainous Aaron to a painful death, the boy takes pity on Aaron's infant son, carrying him away from the violence as he walks slowly into the sunrise. This ending is perhaps more positive than the ending of other productions of the play, including Taymor's stage production, in which Young Lucius is fixated upon the \"tiny black coffin\" holding the dead infant.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3844238.pdf | A Tale of Two Tituses | Shakespeare Quarterly (2002)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Julie Taymor]] took Shakespeare's script, added various linking scenes without dialogue (while cutting some of the text) and set the play in an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] fantasy world that uses locations, costumes and imagery from many periods of history, including [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s [[Italy]], to give the impression of a Roman Empire that survived into the modern era. The opening scenes commence with a heavily choreographed triumphal march of the Roman troops, complete with motorcycle outriders. The selection of music is similarly diverse.<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/563 BFI | Sight & Sound | Titus (1999)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124064311/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/563 |date=24 November 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios in Rome and on location at various historic monuments.
