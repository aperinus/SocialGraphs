Its plot follows a New York City couple who are sought out by a stranger who believes their adolescent daughter is a [[reincarnation]] of his deceased one. It is based on the [[Audrey Rose (novel)|1975 novel of the same name]] by [[Frank De Felitta]], who also adapted the screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nBill and Janice Templeton live a privileged life in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] with their 11-year-old daughter, Ivy. Over a period of several weeks, they begin to notice a stranger following them in various public places, and Janice grows alarmed when she sees the man follow her and Ivy home one afternoon. The man eventually reaches out to the couple by phone, revealing himself as Elliot Hoover, a widower who lost his wife and young daughter, Audrey Rose, in a car accident in [[Pittsburgh]]. The couple agree to have dinner with Elliot, during which he explains that he believes their daughter, Ivy, is a [[reincarnation]] of Audrey, and that details relayed to him by [[psychic]]s confirm his suspicions; the details he is aware of include intimate knowledge of the couple's apartment and Ivy's bedroom. Furthermore, Ivy was born only minutes after Audrey died.\n\nBill, a skeptic, believes Elliot is [[extortion|extorting]] the family. He invites Elliot to their apartment, and arranges for his attorney friend, Russ, to listen covertly to their conversation from upstairs. When Elliot speaks Audrey's name, Ivy hears him from her room and enters an altered state of panic, which is only calmed by Elliot's presence. In this state, she bangs her hands against the cold window, and it leaves inexplicable burns. Elliot comforts her, after which she recognizes him as \"daddy\" and slowly falls asleep. Elliot insists that Ivy's burns are evidence of her reincarnation, as Audrey burned to death in the car accident. Bill grows enraged by Elliot and forces him out, punching him in the face, but Janice and even Russ are sympathetic to the strange man's plea.\n\nOne night while Bill is working late, Ivy experiences another [[night terror]], in which she thrashes around the apartment violently. Janice, unable to control her, is surprised by Elliot's appearance at her door, and eagerly allows him in to help calm Ivy, but Bill remonstrates with Janice when he learns of the visit. During Ivy\u2019s next episode, Elliot again arrives and Bill attacks him. After a struggle, Elliot locks the couple out of their apartment and disappears with Ivy through a service exit. An attendant informs the couple that Elliot rented an apartment in the building earlier that day. Police quickly discover him and Ivy in the apartment, apprehend him, and charge him with child abduction.\n\nA trial ensues, during which Janice and Bill have Ivy sent to a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[boarding school]] in upstate New York to shield her from the public. During the trial, Elliot attempts to persuade the jury that his actions were necessary to grant peace to the spirit of his daughter, Audrey. The trial becomes an international news story, with a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] holy man testifying about their religious belief in reincarnation, to which Elliot ascribes. When questioned on the stand, Janice relents and admits that she believes Elliot, and that he had only pure interests in helping Ivy. The judge grants a recess in the trial, and Janice and Bill are subsequently informed that Ivy has injured herself at her boarding school by crawling toward a fire pit during a [[Christmas]] celebration.\n\nAfter Ivy is treated for burns, Janice remains in upstate New York, and the two spend the evening in a hotel. In the middle of the night, Janice finds Ivy repeatedly greeting herself as Audrey Rose in the bathroom mirror. In a motion to complete Elliot's trial, Bill and Janice's attorney requests that Ivy be [[hypnosis|hypnotized]] as a means of proving she is not a reincarnation of Audrey. The hypnotist employs a [[past life regression]] hypnosis, which is observed in a hospital by the jury, along with Elliot, Bill, and Janice. The hypnosis reaches a fever pitch as Ivy revisits the traumatic car crash that took Audrey's life, and she begins to react violently. She eventually loses consciousness, and Elliot smashes the one-way mirror to access the room and attempt to calm her, but she dies in his arms.\n\nSome time later, Janice writes a letter to Elliot, thanking him for transporting Ivy's cremated remains to India, and expressing her hope that Bill will come to accept her and Elliot's belief that Ivy was a reincarnation of Audrey. A closing [[intertitle]] quotes the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad-Gita]]'': {{blockquote|\"There is no end. For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does it ever cease to be. It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval...\"}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Janice Templeton\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Elliot Hoover\n* [[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]] as Bill Templeton\n* [[Susan Swift]] as Ivy Templeton / Audrey Rose\n* [[Norman Lloyd]] as Dr. Steven Lipscomb\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Prosecutor Scott Velie\n* Ivy Jones as Mary Lou Sides\n* [[Robert Walden]] as Brice Mack\n* [[Stephen Pearlman]] as Russ Rothman\n* Aly Wassil as Maharishi Gupta Pradesh\n* [[Mary Jackson (actress)|Mary Jackson]] as Mother Veronica\n* Elizabeth Farley as Carole Rothman\n* [[Richard Lawson (actor)|Richard Lawson]] as Policeman\n* [[Bill Beutel]] as Bill Beutel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nDirector Robert Wise began an extensive search to cast the title role, initially auditioning young actresses in major cities such as [[Los Angeles]] and New York.<ref name=afi/> Susan Swift was eventually cast in the role after auditioning in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=afi/> The film marked her feature debut.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography of ''Audrey Rose'' began on July 26, 1976, on sound stages in Los Angeles and [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=afi>{{cite web|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|title=Audrey Rose|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55872|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125043415/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55872|archive-date=January 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Filming continued through November, when the production moved to New York City, where exterior sequences were shot on location.<ref name=afi/> The film had a production budget of approximately $4 million.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\n{{As of|2022|11}}, the film has a score of 55% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/audrey_rose/ |title=Audrey Rose |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=November 12, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The soul of the movie is that of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' instantly recycled.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05E5DB1039E334BC4F53DFB266838C669EDE|author=Canby, Vincent|title=Film: The Devil Fumbles a Passing Soul|date=April 7, 1977|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and called the first hour \"excellent\" but the second half \"pretty bad ...
