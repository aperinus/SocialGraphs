Due to 20th century urbanisation of the area, it was filmed in the more rural [[Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant]] and [[Llansilin]] in [[Powys]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1917, during [[World War I]], two English [[cartographer]]s, the pompous George Garrad and his junior, Reginald Anson arrive at the fictional Welsh village of [[Ffynnon garw|Ffynnon Garw]] to measure its \"[[mountain]]\" &ndash; only to cause outrage when they conclude that it is only a [[hill]] because it is slightly short of the required height of 1,000 feet (305 m).\n\nThe villagers, aided and abetted by wily local, Morgan the Goat, and the Reverend Mr. Jones who, after initially opposing the scheme, grasps its symbolism in restoring the community's war-damaged self-esteem, conspire to delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth mound on top of the hill and make it high enough to be considered a mountain.\n\nThe scene is set with Anson and Garrad the cartographers (who are to measure the mountain) arriving at the village, but everyone in town is at church (it being a Sunday). The only exception is Morgan the Goat who manages the local inn and is the only [[redhead]] in the village. Most of the men of the town are away at war and the film implies that the women are visiting the inn and having redheaded children. On the first day Anson and Garrad reach the top and do some preliminary measurements and come up with a height of 930 feet. Anson returns and reassures them that they have more accurate measurements to make the next day.\n\nThe next day, when they go to the mountain the entire village is milling around the mountain and eagerly anticipating the results. The cartographers after the measurements announce that the more accurate measurements indicate a height of 984 feet which is just 16 feet short of the 1,000 feet needed to qualify the \"hill\" as a mountain. The townsfolk are crestfallen and the town pastor announces a town hall meeting. In the meeting Morgan the Goat proposes that they raise the mountain by 20 feet and one of the leadership agrees saying that they have seen mountains with permanent structures atop them like tombs.\n\nMorgan, the constable and the village elder return to the cartographers to persuade them to stay while they build a structure on the mountain but Anson the cartographer disagrees and says they have a tight schedule and they will be leaving in the morning.\n\nThe next morning, everyone rallies and starts digging earth from their backyards and transporting it to hill to add 20 or so feet to it. The first day they make a mound that is approximately 14 feet high. Meanwhile in town someone has sabotaged the car belonging to the cartographer and the pastor just to be sure also punctures a tire. The cartographers have to push the car to the mechanic who does not know anything about the car but deliberately fumbles around and breaks a part and then informs the cartographers that the part will be needed to be brought in from [[Cardiff]].\n\nWhen the cartographers try to catch a train from the local station, they are misinformed that the trains only carry coal by the station master who is colluding with the townspeople to keep them in the town. Morgan also enlists a local lady to entertain the two Englishmen.\n\nAt this point, it starts raining and the mud on the hill starts washing off down from 14 feet to 10 feet. Morgan declares an emergency and asks the mechanic to remove the tarp covering the car belonging to the cartographers and to take it to the mountain to cover the works under construction. In the meanwhile in town the two cartographers are entertained by a local lady.\n\nThe rain continues all night and all day from Thursday to Sunday. On Sunday, the pastor of the church encourages the villagers to finish the work they started. Upon the suggestion of the Englishman Anson they also cover the mound with sod before the last light. The pastor then dies and is buried on the mountain.\n\nAfter the burial the townspeople convince Anson to stay the night and measure the mountain first thing in the morning at the break of dawn because their train leaves at around 8 AM. Anson stays on the mountain with Betty who offers to keep him company and they kiss.\n\nWhen Anson descends from the mountain he informs the people that the mountain is 1,002 feet high and announces his engagement. The end of the movie describes the mountain settling down to 997 feet and turning back into a hill from a mountain. The spirit of the Reverend buried on the mountain exhales \"a hill\" in a groan and all the people rally in modern day Wales with buckets and earth to raise the mountain again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Reginald Anson\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as George Garrad\n* [[Tara Fitzgerald]] as Elizabeth/Betty from Cardiff\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Morgan the Goat\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Johnny Shellshocked\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Williams the Petroleum \n* [[Kenneth Griffith]] as the Reverend Robert Jones\n* [[Ieuan Rhys]] as Sgt Thomas\n\n==Production ==\n===Writing ===\nIn the script there is a joke which is not obvious to non-Welsh speakers. A mechanic is asked about a nondescript broken part he has removed from a car, and replies \"Well I don't know the English word, but in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] we call it a ''be'chi'ngalw.''\"  In Welsh, ''be'chi'ngalw'' is a [[placeholder name]], like \"whatchamacallit\" or \"thingamajig\" in English.<ref>{{Citation | title = Geiriadur yr Academi / The Welsh Academy English-Welsh Dictionary | publisher = University of Wales Press | page = 1661}}.</ref> and literally means \"what [do] you call\" and is a contracted form of \"beth dych chi'n galw\". The joke is made obvious in the novel published after the film's release.\n\n==Release==\nThe film grossed $11 million in the United States and Canada and $21 million worldwide.<ref name=SI/>\n==Reception==\n[[File:Garth hill (geograph 6339048).jpg|thumb|The Garth]]\nIn regard to its humorous and affectionate description of the locals, the film has often been compared with ''[[Waking Ned]]'', a comedy film written and directed by [[Kirk Jones (director)|Kirk Jones]]. The movie has resulted in a stream of visitors climbing to the summit of [[Garth Hill|The Garth]], and the [[Pentyrch]] History Society and the local community council have erected a notice on the mountain to explain its real historical significance.<ref>\"A  book was written about 'Ffynnon Garw' which was made into a film 'The Englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain'. The location of Ffynnon Garw rather implies it is The Garth. This story is a good one but fictional. To set the record straight the Pentyrch History Society and Community Council have put up an information notice near the summit.\" [http://www.pentyrch.com/pentyrch/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=62&Itemid=30 pentyrch.com]</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 66% from 32 reviews.
