The film explores Caouette's life as he negotiates his complicated relationship with his mother as her child, friend and ultimately, parental figure while developing his creativity as an actor, writer and director.\n\nCaouette [[coming out|came out]] as gay at a young age and moved to New York City at age 25, eventually finding a boyfriend named David Sanin Paz. They both live in New York City today. As documented in the film, his mother has lived with them at times and they've formed an unusual family. A scene early in the movie has an approximately 11-year-old Caouette improvising a monologue as a woman in an abusive relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonathancaouette.blogspot.com/2004/10/tarnation-reviews-links.html |title=Tarnation Reviews & Links |publisher=Jonathancaouette.blogspot.com |date=2004-10-21 |access-date=2013-07-26}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack uses songs by [[Hex (band)|Hex]] ([[Donnette Thayer]] and [[Steve Kilbey]]), [[Lisa Germano]], [[Cocteau Twins|The Cocteau Twins]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Low (rock band)|Low]], [[Mark Kozelek]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[The Magnetic Fields]], [[Iron and Wine]], [[The Chocolate Watch Band]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Red House Painters]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and many more. Orchestral cues for the film were composed by John Califra.  [[Max Avery Lichtenstein]] wrote several original instrumental songs for the film, including the film's recurring theme \"Tarnation\".\n\nThe film's trailer features orchestral music by John Califra, \"Tarnation\" by Max Avery Lichtenstein, and the song \"Safe As Milk\" by the band [[Hopewell (band)|Hopewell]].\n\nNo soundtrack compilation album has been released, but a digital E.P. featuring selections of Max Avery Lichtenstein's original music for the film was released in 2005 by Tin Drum Recordings.\n\n==Production==\nCaouette was shaping his material when he sent in an audition tape for [[John Cameron Mitchell]]'s ''[[Shortbus]]''. The tape contained the footage of an 11-year-old Jonathan imitating a battered wife. Mitchell was impressed and encouraged him to continue working on the film. He alerted Stephen Winter, then the artistic director of [[MIX NYC]], the New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival. Stephen became the producer of ''Tarnation''. A tape found its way to Mitchell's friend, [[Gus Van Sant]], who was also deeply moved by the film. Both he and Mitchell signed on as executive producers.<ref name=\"laweekly1\">{{cite web |author=Foundas, Scott |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/what-in-tarnation/1278/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130128032956/http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/what-in-tarnation/1278/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-28 |title=What in Tarnation |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2004-10-14 |access-date=2013-07-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe November 2003 world premiere of the movie at MIX was much more abstract in nature, running about two hours. With input from Mitchell, Winter, and co-editor Brian A. Kates, Caouette shot new footage and edited the film down to about 90 minutes for its screening at the 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the Frontier Section.  There it was invited to appear in the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]] [[Directors' Fortnight]].  The filmmakers did not have the $30,000 to make a film print for the festival but at the last minute respected art house distributor Wellspring picked it up and brought it to Cannes where it garnered great critical acclaim and worldwide distribution.<ref name=\"laweekly1\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nCaouette's next completed film in 2007 was ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties (2009 film)|All Tomorrow's Parties]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lumenick |first=Lou |author-link=Lou Lumenick |url=http://blogs.nypost.com/movies/archives/2007/11/deep_in_the_hea.html |title=Update: Deep in the Heart |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2007-11-02 |access-date=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103133647/http://blogs.nypost.com/movies/archives/2007/11/deep_in_the_hea.html |archive-date=2009-01-03 }}</ref>\n\n[[Walk Away Renee (film)|''Walk Away Renee'']], Jonathan's companion film to ''Tarnation'', examines a certain later period involving the filmmaker and his mother.
