It was the opening film of the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009.<ref name=\"BBC News:Opener\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094651.stm |title=BBC News:Venice announces Italian opener |access-date=2009-06-11|work=BBC News | date=2009-06-11}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film recounts life in the Sicilian town of [[Bagheria]] (known as Baar\u00eca in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), from the 1930s to the 1980s, through the eyes of lovers Peppino (Francesco Scianna) and Mannina (Margareth Mad\u00e8).\nA Sicilian family depicted across three generations: from Cicco to his son Peppino to his grandson Pietro. Touching lightly on the private lives of these characters and their families, the film evokes the loves, dreams and disappointments of an entire community in the [[province of Palermo]] over five decades: during the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist period]], Cicco is a shepherd who finds time to pursue his passion: books, epic poems, the great popular romance novels. In the days when people go hungry and during World War II, his son Peppino witnesses injustice by ''[[Sicilian Mafia|mafiosi]]'' and landowners. He becomes a [[Communist Party of Italy|communist]]. After the war, he encounters the woman of his life. Her family opposes the relationship because of his political ideas, but the two insist on marrying. They have children and raise their family. \n\nSubplots include one about a boy running an errand, a living fly locked inside a [[top]], three rocks people try to hit in one throw, a man mutilating himself to avoid having to fight in the war, looting while the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|U.S. invades Sicily]], making clothing from an American parachute, and Peppino's daughter calling her father a fascist for not allowing her to wear a [[mini-skirt]].\n\nRunning through the film is the main subplot, related to the history of the Italian left, especially the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party]], of which Peppino is a lifelong member. It charts his fight against injustice and eventual disillusionment in the face of corruption and compromise by his fellow politicians.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was first announced during the 2007 [[Taormina]] Film Festival.\n\nThe film was shot in both [[Bagheria]], where Tornatore was born, and in an old neighborhood of [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]]; the latter location used because it could better depict what Bagheria looked like in the early 20th century.\n\n==Language==\nThe film exists in two versions, the original in the local Baariotu dialect of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and the second dubbed in [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://cinema-tv.corriere.it/cinema/speciali/2009/venezia/notizie/tornatore_dialetto_doppiaggio_manin_dde30c6c-9780-11de-b29b-00144f02aabc.shtml \"Dialetto o doppiaggio?

The animal was killed with an iron punch driven in the skull without any pain-relief technique, and then seen bleeding to death while some actors collect and drink its blood.\n\nSuch a scene could not have been shot in Italy, because of laws against the unethical treatment of animals in media production. That part of the movie was filmed in Tunisia, where there are no such restrictions.\n\nThereafter the ENPA (National Association of Animal Protection) demanded the immediate withdrawal of all copies distributed in theatres \"to avoid the exposition of minors to such disgusting and fearful images\", as the film is rated for an unrestricted audience. Again according to the ENPA, although the scene was filmed in Tunisia thus bypassing the Italian law, after application to the Minister of Justice, the prosecution can still take place in Italy.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.corriere.it/animali/09_ottobre_02/enpa-denuncia-baaria-ritiro-film-sale_20e90e98-af65-11de-8f80-00144f02aabc.shtml L'Enpa: ritirate \u00abBaar\u00eca\u00bb da tutte le sale] - Corriere della Sera, 2 ottobre 2009</ref> In October 2009, the ENPA started an international boycott campaign against the film and an online petition asking to revoke the designation of the movie as Italian entry to the Oscars.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.enpa.it/it/iniziative/baaria/ ENPA: ''Na all'Oscar insanguinato] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006085756/http://www.enpa.it/it/iniziative/baaria/ |date=2009-10-06 }} Linked 2013-11-05</ref>\n\nResponding to these critics, director Giuseppe Tornatore clarified that the location in Tunisia was not intended to bypass Italian regulations, and that the animal was not specifically killed for the film. The scene was filmed in a local slaughterhouse and the killing was one of the many that take place there every day.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.lastampa.it/lazampa/girata.asp?ID_blog=164&ID_articolo=1410&ID_sezione=339] La Stampa (online edition), 30 settembre 2009</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Italian films of 2009]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1081935|Baar\u00eca}}\n\n{{Giuseppe Tornatore}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baaria}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Sicilian-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:2009 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Giuseppe Tornatore]]\n[[Category:Films set in Sicily]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy-drama films]]"}]}}}}
