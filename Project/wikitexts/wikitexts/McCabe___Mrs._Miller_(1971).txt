The screenplay by Altman and Brian McKay is based on the 1959 novel ''McCabe'' by [[Edmund Naughton]].<ref name=Naughton>{{cite book |title=McCabe |last=Naughton |first=Edmund |year=1959 |publisher=MacMillan |oclc=1856056 }} Many editions of the novel in several languages were published subsequent to the release of the film; see {{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AMcCabe+au%3AEdmund+Naughton&fq=x0%3Abook&qt=advanced&dblist=638 |title=Search results for ti:McCabe au:Edmund Naughton |work=[[WorldCat]]}}</ref> Altman referred to it as an \"anti-[[Western (genre)|Western]]\" film because it ignores or subverts a number of Western conventions.<ref>As cited in {{cite book |title=Cinematic Thinking: Philosophical Approaches to the New Cinema |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Phillips |year=2008 |chapter=Robert Altman: The West as Countermemory |last=Shapiro |first=Michael J. |quote=He called his film an \"'anti-Western' because the film turns a number of Western conventions on their sides\" |page=55 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804758000 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coSaAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA55}}</ref>\n\nThe film has received critical acclaim in the years since its release and earned an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for Christie in the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] category. The film was deemed the 8th greatest Western of all time by the [[American Film Institute]] in its [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] list in 2008 and, in 2010, was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1902 Washington state, a gambler named John McCabe arrives mysteriously and mumbling to himself in the town of Presbyterian Church, named after its only substantial building, a tall but mostly unused chapel. McCabe quickly takes a dominant position over the town's simple-minded and lethargic miners, thanks to his aggressive personality and rumors that he is a gunfighter. McCabe establishes a makeshift brothel, consisting of three prostitutes purchased for $200 from a pimp in the nearby town of Bearpaw. British [[cockney]] Constance Miller arrives in town and tells him she could run a brothel for him more profitably. The two become financially successful business partners, open a higher class establishment including a bathhouse for hygiene, and a romantic relationship develops between the two, though she charges him for sex.\n\nAs the town becomes richer, Sears and Hollander, a pair of agents from the Harrison Shaughnessy Mining Company in Bearpaw, arrive to buy out McCabe's business, as well as the surrounding zinc mines. Shaughnessy is notorious for having people killed when they refuse to sell. McCabe does not want to sell at their initial price of $5,500, but he overplays his hand in the negotiations in spite of Mrs. Miller's warnings that he is underestimating the violence that will ensue if they do not take the money.\n\nThree bounty hunters &ndash; Butler, Breed and Kid &ndash; are dispatched by the mining company to kill McCabe, as well as make an example of him, but he refuses to abandon the town. Clearly afraid of the gunmen when they arrive in town, McCabe initially tries to appease them. Butler confronts him about his earlier story that he is successful gunfighter \"Pudgy McCabe\", who shot someone in a card game. After hearing McCabe's story, with the addition that the gun was a [[Derringer]], Butler proclaims that McCabe has never killed anyone in his life. McCabe later tries to find Sears and Hollander to try to settle on a price, but upon learning that they have left the area, he visits lawyer Clement Samuels to try to obtain legal protection from Harrison Shaughnessy. Although the lawyer agrees to help McCabe bust the mining company's monopoly on the area, McCabe returns to town convinced that he must face the bounty hunters on his own.\n\nWhen a lethal confrontation becomes inevitable, McCabe arms himself and hides in the chapel during the early morning hours, but is evicted by the armed pastor, who is then shot by the assassin Butler in a case of mistaken identity. A broken lantern starts a fire in the church and the townspeople rush to help extinguish it. McCabe continues his evasion, shooting Breed and Kid from hidden positions, killing them; unfortunately, one wounds McCabe as he falls. As the townsfolk mobilize to fight the chapel fire, McCabe plays cat-and-mouse with the last gunman, Butler. McCabe is shot in the back and mortally wounded, but feigns death and kills Butler with a Derringer when he approaches to confirm McCabe's identity. As the townspeople celebrate extinguishing the fire, McCabe dies alone in the snow, while Mrs. Miller lies sedated in an opium den.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per opening tombstone credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Warren Beatty]] as John McCabe\n*[[Julie Christie]] as Constance Miller\n*[[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Sheehan\n*[[William Devane]] as lawyer Clement Samuels\n*[[John Schuck]] as Smalley\n*[[Corey Fischer]] as Mr. Elliot\n*[[Shelley Duvall]] as Ida Coyle\n*[[Keith Carradine]] as the cowboy\n*[[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Sears\n*[[Hugh Millais]] as Butler\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Antony Holland]] appears as Hollander, while [[Bert Remsen]] portrays Bart Coyle.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' is based on [[Edmund Naughton]]'s 1959 novel ''McCabe''. David Foster, one of the film's producers, had purchased the film rights to the novel in 1968; he'd learned of the novel while negotiating with Ellen Wright (the widow of novelist [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]) over the rights to ''[[The Mandarins]]'', a novel by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Wright was acting as the agent for Naughton, who was then living in [[Paris]] and working for the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. With his partner, Mitchell Broward, Foster then negotiated a deal with the Fox studio for two films. By October, 1968, Foster had commissioned a screenplay from [[Ben Maddow]], a well-known poet and screenwriter.<ref name=McGilligan>{{cite book |last=McGilligan |first=Patrick |title=Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff |pages=339 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zzxOVHFL_oC&pg=PA339 |publisher=Macmillan |year=1989 |isbn=9780312304676 |oclc=18521062}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Cinema of Robert Altman: Hollywood Maverick |first=Robert |last=Niemi |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2016 |isbn=9780231850865 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wG3lCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT66|page=66}}</ref><ref name=Dessem>{{cite web|title=The making and unmaking of ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' |first=Matthew |last=Dessem |work=The Dissolve |url=http://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/774-the-making-and-unmaking-of-mccabe-mrs-miller/ |date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028083643/http://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/774-the-making-and-unmaking-of-mccabe-mrs-miller/ |archive-date=October 28, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Altman was in post-production on ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' and snuck Foster into the screening; Foster liked the film, and signed Altman to direct a film based on ''McCabe''. They agreed to wait until ''M*A*S*H'' became a box-office hit to take the pitch for ''McCabe'' to a studio for funding. A second screenplay \u2013 independent of Maddow's \u2013 was commissioned from Brian McKay, who completed it in only five weeks. A revised version of that screenplay dated July 1970 became the \"shooting script\" for the film.<ref name=Dessem /> Altman and McKay are listed in the film's credits as its screenwriters; Maddow went uncredited.\n\nAltman offered the lead to [[Elliott Gould]] who turned it down to make ''I Love My Wife''. \"Bob said, 'You're making the mistake of your life',\" said Gould. \"There was a part of me that was not developed at all and that had no real understanding about what the woman is. Bob wanted to cast [[Pat Quinn (American actress)|Patricia Quinn]] as Mrs. Miller, and I hadn't seen 'Alice's Restaurant' and I hadn't met her. I had some misconceptions because I wanted her to have the same relationship with Altman as I had. I recently watched 'Alice's Restaurant' and she's great. Altman was so right.\"<ref name=\"hidden\">{{cite web|url=https://hidden-films.com/2013/07/24/the-lesser-known-or-less-celebrated-films-of-elliott-gould-part-1/|website=Hidden Films|title=The Lesser Known (or Less Celebrated) Films of Elliott Gould (Part 1)|date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFoster called Warren Beatty in England, about the film; Beatty flew to [[New York City]] to see ''M*A*S*H'' and then flew to [[Los Angeles, California]] to sign for ''McCabe''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe film was originally called ''The Presbyterian Church Wager'', after a bet placed among the church's few attendees, about whether McCabe would survive his refusal of the offer to buy his property. Altman reported that an official in the [[Presbyterian Church]] called Warner Brothers, to complain about having its church mentioned in a film about brothels and gambling. The complaint prompted a name change to ''John Mac Cabe'' but it was released as ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Filming===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\nThe film was shot in [[West Vancouver]] and in [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]], almost in sequential order, a rarity for film makers. The crew found a suitable location for the filming and built up the \"set\", as McCabe built up the town in the film. Mrs. Miller is brought into town on a [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case]] 80 HP [[steam engine]] from 1912; the steam engine is genuine and functioning and the crew used it to power the lumbermill after its arrival. Carpenters for the film were locals and young men from the United States, fleeing [[conscription]] into the [[Vietnam War]]; they were dressed in period costume and used tools of the period, so that they could go about their business in the background, while the plot advanced in the foreground.\n\nThe crew ran buried hoses throughout the town, placed so they could create the appearance of rain. Since the city of [[Vancouver]] generally receives a great deal of rain, it was usually only necessary to turn on the hoses to make scenes shot on the rare days when it didn't rain, to match those shot on days when it did.\n\nIt began snowing near the end of shooting, when the church fire and the standoff were the only scenes left. Beatty did not want to start shooting in the snow, as it was financially risky to do so: to preserve continuity, the rest of the film would have to be shot in snow. Altman countered that since those were the only scenes left to film, it was best to start since there was nothing else to do. The \"standoff\" scene\u2014which is in fact more a \"cat and mouse\" scene involving shooting one's enemy in the back\u2014and its concurrent church fire scene, were shot over nine days. The heavy snow, with the exception of a few \"fill-in\" patches on the ground, was genuine; the crew members built snowmen and had snowball fights between takes.\n\nThe film, especially the final scene, is atypical of the western genre. The showdown between a reluctant protagonist and his enemies takes place ungracefully in the snow during the early hours, rather than at \"high noon\". Instead of hiding indoors and watching the battle unfold outside, the townsfolk are bustling in the streets and largely unaware of the gunfight taking place in their midst. For a distinctive look, Altman and Zsigmond chose to \"[[Flashing (cinematography)|flash]]\" (pre-fog) the film negative before its eventual exposure, as well as use a number of filters on the cameras, rather than manipulate the film in post-production; in this way the studio could not force him to change the film's look to something less distinctive.\n\n=== Editing ===\nThe editing of ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' took much longer than its filming. Altman and Lou Lombardo, the editor and second unit director, spent nine months editing the film in North Vancouver, close to the location of the filming itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plecki |first=Gerard |title=Robert Altman |page=[https://archive.org/details/robertaltman0000plec/page/41 41] |publisher=Twayne |year=1985 |isbn=9780805793031 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/robertaltman0000plec/page/41 }} No online access.</ref> The editing was an innovation in its time because the principal storyline about John McCabe and Constance Miller occupies relatively little of the film's running time, especially in the first half of the film. [[Pauline Kael]] emphasized this in her 1971 review of the film. She wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The classical story is only a thread in the story that Altman is telling ... The people who drop in and out of the place\u2014a primitive mining town\u2014are not just background for McCabe and Mrs. Miller; McCabe and Mrs. Miller are simply the two most interesting people in the town, and we catch their stories in glimpses, as they interact with the other characters and each other ... Lives are picked up and let go, and the sense of how little we know about them becomes part of the texture; we generally know little about the characters in movies, but since we're assured that that little is all we need to know, and thus all there is to know, we're not bothered by it. Here we seem to be witnesses to a vision of the past ...<ref name=Kael>{{cite book |title=The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael |first=Pauline |last=Kael |publisher=Library of America |date=2011 |editor1-first=Sanford |editor1-last=Schwartz|isbn=9781598531718 |chapter=Pipe Dream |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkShTL84MrcC&pg=PT429}} Reprinting of Kael's 1971 review ({{cite magazine |last=Kael |first=Pauline |magazine=The New Yorker |date=July 3, 1971 |title=The Current Cinema: Pipe Dream |page=40}}).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis aspect of the film's editing also carried through into the film's unusual sound editing, which can blend many conversations and noises and does not emphasize the principal characters. In his textbook on film production, Bruce Mamer wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Robert Altman was famous for using this style of layered dialogue cutting. The frontier barroom scene that opens his ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' (Louis Lombardo, editor) has snippets of conversations underlying the foreground action.<ref name=Mamer>{{cite book |title=Film Production Technique: Creating the Accomplished Image |last=Mamer |first=Bruce |page=393 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwfxlkeYgMQC&pg=PA393 |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=9780495411161|edition=Fifth }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKen Dancyger describes the effect in terms of its undermining of dialogue as an element in the film,\n\n<blockquote>Many characters speak simultaneously, and we are aware of the discreteness of their conversations, but as their comments bleed into those of others, the effect is to undermine the dialogue. The scene moves dialogue from the informational status it usually occupies to the category of noise. Language becomes a sound effect. When we do hear the dialogue, it is the speaker who is important rather than what is being said.<ref name=Dancyger>{{cite book |title=The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice |last=Dancyger |first=Ken |year=2010 |publisher=Focal Press |page=283 |isbn=9780240813974 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m20GrX-ZmmoC&pg=PA283|edition=Fifth }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, Jay Beck writes\n\n<blockquote>''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'' represents the full-scale launch of the practice of overlapping dialogue in Altman's cinema. The visual and acoustic strategies in the film avoid foregrounding the main characters in the narrative and the audience has to work to follow the story, or stories, as they unfold.<ref name=Beck>{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jay |chapter=Atlman's Sound Aesthetics in the 1970s |page=191 |editor1-first=Adrian |editor1-last=Danks |title=A Companion to Robert Altman |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2015 |isbn=9781118288900 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rr7CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA191}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Leonard Cohen's songs ===\nOther than the music occurring in the ordinary life of Presbyterian Church, the only music for the film is from three songs composed and performed by [[Leonard Cohen]], a Canadian poet who had released his first album of songs in 1967. Their importance is emphasized by [[Scott Tobias]], who wrote in 2014 that \"The film is unimaginable to me without the Cohen songs, which function as these mournful interstitials that unify the entire movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=McCabe & Mrs. Miller: profound pessimism and Leonard Cohen kindness |first1=Keith |last1=Phipps |first2=Scott |last2=Tobias |work=The Dissolve |url=http://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/772-mccabe-mrs-miller-profound-pessimism-and-leonard-c/ |date=September 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAltman had liked Cohen's debut album immensely, ''[[Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'' (1967), buying additional copies of it after wearing out each vinyl record. He had then forgotten about the album. A few years later, Altman visited Paris, just after finishing shooting ''McCabe & Mrs. Miller'', and rediscovered Cohen's album. He had Lou Lombardo, the film's editor, use the music to maintain a rhythm for the film (in effect using it as a \"temp\" track). He later said, \"I think the reason they worked was because those lyrics were etched in my subconscious, so when I shot the scenes I fitted them to the songs, as if they were written for them.\"<ref name=Altman>{{cite book |title=Altman on Altman |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Thompson |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |date=2006}} Cited in {{cite news |work=The Buffalo Film Seminars |title=Robert Altman: McCabe & Mrs. Miller |date=March 4, 2008 |volume=XVI |issue=8 |last1=Christian |first1=Diane |last2=Jackson |first2=Bruce |url=http://csac.buffalo.edu/mccabe.pdf }}</ref>\n\nAltman didn't expect to be able to procure rights for Cohen's music since ''McCabe'' was a [[Warner Brothers]] film and Cohen's album was released through [[Columbia Records]]. He called Cohen, expecting to trade off his recent success with ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', but found that Cohen had no knowledge of it. Instead, Cohen had loved Altman's less popular follow-up film ''[[Brewster McCloud]]''. Cohen arranged for his record company to license the music cheaply, even writing into the contract that sales of that album after the release of ''McCabe'' would turn some of the royalties to Altman (an arrangement which at the time was quite unusual).<ref>{{cite book |title=Robert Altman's Soundtracks: Film, Music, and Sound from M*A*S*H to a Prairie Home Companion |first=Gayle Sherwood |last=Magee |page=61 ff |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780199915965 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlBjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Cinema of Robert Altman: Hollywood Maverick |first=Robert |last=Niemi |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2016 |isbn=9780231850865 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wG3lCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT70|page=170}}</ref> The three Cohen songs used in the film were \"The Stranger Song\", \"Sisters of Mercy\" and \"Winter Lady\".
