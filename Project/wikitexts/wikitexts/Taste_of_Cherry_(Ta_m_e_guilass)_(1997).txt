The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], which it shared with ''[[The Eel (film)|The Eel]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nMr. Badii, a middle-aged man, drives through [[Tehran]] looking for someone to do a job for him, for which he offers a large amount of money. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He tells the people he is soliciting to go to the spot he has chosen the next morning, and either help him up, if he has chosen to live, or to bury him, if he has chosen to die. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide.\n\nHis first recruit is a young, shy [[Kurd]]ish soldier, who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an [[Afghan people|Afghan]] [[seminarist]], who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is Mr. Bagheri, an [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child. He tries to convince Badii not to commit suicide, and reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide in 1960 but chose to live when, after failing his attempt, he tasted [[mulberry|mulberries]] which dropped from a tree, and reveals that he then went home with the mulberries, and gave it to his wife, which she enjoyed. He continues to discuss what he perceives to be the beauty of life, including sunrises and the moon and stars. Bagheri promises to throw dirt on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. Badii drops him back at his workplace, but suddenly runs back to meet him, requesting that Bagheri confirm if he's actually dead by throwing some stones at him and jolting him awake, in case he is asleep.\n\nThat night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the [[fourth wall]] with [[camcorder]] footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming ''Taste of Cherry'', leaving Badii's choice unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Homayoun Ershadi]] as Mr. Badii \n* Abdolrahman Bagheri as Mr. Bagheri, the taxidermist\n* Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari as Worker\n* Safar Ali Moradi as Soldier\n* Mir Hossein Noori as Seminarian\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Tasteofcherrycolour1.gif|thumb|right|200px|The consistent close up of the character Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) in ''Taste of Cherry'' is later juxtaposed by a panoramic overhead view as his car moves across the hills]]\nThe film is minimalist in that it is shot primarily with [[long take]]s; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of ambient (background) sound, which the closing sequence shows the crew recording. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is talking to (this is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat). {{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\n==Music==\nThe film does not include a background score, except for the ending titles. This features a trumpet piece, [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1929 adaptation of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues]].\" The only other song featured in the film is \"Khuda Bowad Yaret\" (May God be your protector) by Afghan singer [[Ahmad Zaher]], which is played in the background on a radio about 38 minutes into the film. {{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\n==Release==\n''Taste of Cherry'' was awarded the prestigious [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]] in the year of its release,<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4835/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Taste of Cherry |access-date=2009-09-23|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> tied with [[Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]''.\n\n===Reception===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 39 reviews, with the \"critics consensus\" reading, \"''Taste of Cherry''<nowiki/>'s somewhat simple aesthetic belies a richly ambiguous character study with an impressively ambitious thematic scale.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Taste of Cherry (1997)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/taste_of_cherry|language=en|access-date=2022-10-13}}</ref> Rob Aldam of ''Backseat Mafia'' described the film as \"an assured and studied meditation on the question of whether life is worth living\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.backseatmafia.com/blu-ray-review-taste-of-cherry/|url-status=live|title=Blu-Ray Review: Taste of Cherry|date=24 August 2020}}</ref> Matthew Lucas of ''From the Front Row'' wrote:<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lucas|first=Matthew|title=From the Repertory {{!}} November 2020|url=http://www.fromthefrontrow.net/2020/11/from-repertory-november-2020.html|access-date=2021-02-23|website=From the Front Row}}</ref> \n{{Blockquote|text=\"The ending is ambiguous in the most lovely Kiarostami tradition, but its segue into behind the scenes footage is as exhilarating as it is disorienting.

In doing so it attains a kind of haunting mysticism, profoundly shifting the audience's perception of reality. It's Kiarostami's finest work, and one of the best films of the 1990s.\"}}\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"simultaneously epic and precisely minuscule\", writing that \"it isn't until Badii meets the taxidermist that the film finds a lyrical voice to match its powerful visual imagery. His gorgeous, rough-hewn soliloquy about regaining his zest for life after trying to hang himself from a mulberry tree is a simple, eloquent parable of the senses opening to the refreshment of life's simple pleasures.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title='Taste of Cherry': Simultaneously Epic and Precisely Minuscule|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/032098taste-film-review.html|access-date=2021-02-23|website=archive.nytimes.com}}</ref> According to [[Stanley Kauffmann|Stanley Kauffman]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'', \"As the film's design becomes clear to us, a quiet spaciousness begins to inhabit it.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e Guilass) - Movie Reviews|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/taste_of_cherry/reviews|language=en|access-date=2021-02-23}}</ref>\n\nOf the minority of negative reviews, [[Roger Ebert]]'s in ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' was the most scathing, giving the film 1 out of 4 stars. Ebert dismissed the film as \"excruciatingly boring\" and added,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980227/REVIEWS/802270309/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Taste Of Cherry}}</ref> <blockquote>\"I understand intellectually what Kiarostami is doing. I am not impatiently asking for action or incident. What I do feel, however, is that Kiarostami's style here is an affectation; the subject matter does not make it necessary, and is not benefited by it. If we're to feel sympathy for Badhi, wouldn't it help to know more about him? To know, in fact, anything at all about him? What purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual? (Not what purpose for the audience--what purpose for Badhi himself? Surely he must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted.) And why must we see Kiarostami's camera crew--a tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are seeing a movie? If there is one thing ''Taste of Cherry'' does not need, it is such a reminder: The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie.\"</blockquote>\n\nEbert later went on to add the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-most-hated | work=RogerEbert.com | title=Ebert's Most Hated}}</ref>\n\nIn his own review of Kiarostami's film, critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' awarded it a full four stars. Responding to Ebert's criticisms, Rosenbaum wrote:<ref>{{cite web | last =Rosenbaum | first =Jonathan | title =Fill in the Blanks | work =jonathanrosenbaum.net | date =May 29, 1998 | url =http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/?p=6553 | access-date = April 25, 2012}}</ref> <blockquote>\"A colleague who finds ''Taste of Cherry'' \"excruciatingly boring\" objects in particular to the fact that we don\u2019t know anything about Badii, to what he sees as the distracting suggestion that Badii might be a homosexual looking for sex, and to what he sees as the tired \"distancing strategy\" of reminding us at the end that we\u2019re seeing a movie. From the perspective of the history of commercial Western cinema, he has a point on all three counts. But Kiarostami couldn\u2019t care less about conforming to that perspective, and given what he can do, I can\u2019t think of any reason he should care... the most important thing about the joyful finale is that it\u2019s the precise opposite of a \"distancing effect.\" It does invite us into the laboratory from which the film sprang and places us on an equal footing with the filmmaker, yet it does this in a spirit of collective euphoria, suddenly liberating us from the oppressive solitude and darkness of Badii alone in his grave... Kiarostami is representing life in all its rich complexity, reconfiguring elements from the preceding 80-odd minutes in video to clarify what\u2019s real and what\u2019s concocted... Far from affirming that ''Taste of Cherry'' is \"only\" a movie, this wonderful ending is saying, among other things, that it\u2019s also a movie.\"</blockquote>\n\nSince the film's release, multiple other critics have also declared it a masterpiece; in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' poll, six critics and two directors named ''Taste of Cherry'' one of the 10 best films ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b7faa60e1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820083410/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b7faa60e1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 20, 2012 |title=''Taste of Cherry, The'' (1997) |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=June 20, 2015}}</ref> It was also named the 9th best film of the 90s by [[Slant Magazine]].

That\u2019s where the long journey into night and death bring us: We awaken in daylight, outside the world of the film, rejoicing in the action of cinema.
