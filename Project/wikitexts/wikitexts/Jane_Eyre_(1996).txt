This [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] version, directed by [[Franco Zeffirelli]], is similar to the original novel, although it compresses and eliminates most of the plot in the last quarter of the book (the running away, the trials and tribulations, new-found relations, and new job) to condense it into a 2-hour movie.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]] (portrayed as the orphan child by [[Anna Paquin]] and as an adult by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]) is a plain, impoverished young woman hired by [[Mr. Rochester]] ([[William Hurt]]) through Mrs. Fairfax ([[Joan Plowright]]) to work as a governess for Ad\u00e8le (Josephine Serre). Despite her mild unprepossessing nun-like manner, Jane has strong hidden passions and shows her strong character by expressing her opinions and showing resolve in times of trouble. Rochester is a Byronic anti-hero, tortured and tormented by family troubles, past injustices and secrets. Rochester and Jane develop a mutual affinity. They fall in love and the marriage date is set. What Jane does not realize is that she must share the estate and, ultimately, Mr. Rochester with his wife, Bertha ([[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]]), who is mentally ill and is confined in an upstairs attic with a nurse, Grace Poole ([[Billie Whitelaw]]).\n\nThe marriage is stopped by Bertha's brother Richard Mason ([[Edward de Souza]]) and lawyer Briggs ([[Peter Woodthorpe]]). Jane flees; her world in ruins. She recovers in the parsonage, her aunt's original home, and discovers she is now wealthy through inheriting her long-lost uncle's fortune in Madeira. She receives a proposal of marriage from Parson St. John Rivers but her heart and soul is with Rochester. Jane goes back to find Rochester's house, [[Thornfield Hall]], burnt down and Rochester crippled and blinded by a fire set by Bertha, who perished. However, Jane's love for Rochester is undiminished; she nurses him back to health, he recovers his eyesight and they marry.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]]\n**[[Anna Paquin]] as [[Jane Eyre (character)|Young Jane Eyre]]\n*[[William Hurt]] as [[Edward Fairfax Rochester]]\n*[[Fiona Shaw]] as Mrs. Reed\n*[[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Mr. Brocklehurst\n*[[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Miss Scatcherd\n*[[Amanda Root]] as Miss Temple\n*[[Leanne Rowe]] as Helen Burns\n*[[Richard Warwick]] as John\n*[[Joan Plowright]] as Mrs. Fairfax\n*[[Judith Parker]] as Leah\n*Josephine Serre as Ad\u00e8le Varens\n*[[Billie Whitelaw]] as Grace Poole\n*[[Elle Macpherson]] as Blanche Ingram\n*[[Julian Fellowes]] as Colonel Dent\n*[[Edward de Souza]] as Richard Mason\n*[[Peter Woodthorpe]] as Briggs\n*[[Ralph Nossek]] as Reverend Wood\n*[[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] as [[Bertha Mason]]\n*[[Samuel West]] as St. John Rivers\n*[[Charlotte Attenborough]] as Mary Rivers\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe location for Thornfield Hall is [[Haddon Hall]], Bakewell, Derbyshire, UK.<ref>[http://www2.visitbritain.com/en/campaigns/astrabritflick/stop4.html Haddon Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502180654/http://www.visitbritain.com/en/campaigns/astrabritflick/stop4.html |date=2010-05-02 }} at Astra Brit Flick Pilgrimage, Visit Britain.com . Accessed July 2011</ref> Since Zeffirelli's use of Haddon Hall, subsequent versions of Jane Eyre have used it and it is now apparently synonymous with Thornfield Hall. Prior to Zeffirelli's location use, Haddon Hall had been once used (before Jane Eyre) as the castle for ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by Miramax on February 24, 2003. The film debuted on the [[Blu-ray]] format for the first time on September 11, 2012 in a double feature with ''[[Becoming Jane]]'' (2007), released by [[Echo Bridge Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Becoming-Jane-and-Jane-Eyre-Blu-ray/49060/#Overview|title = Becoming Jane / Jane Eyre Blu-ray (Miramax Double Feature)}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a positive rating of 75% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 28 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1071404_jane_eyre/|title=Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (1996)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=25 May 2022}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Hurt \"embarrassingly miscast as a Rochester more nearly a mild eccentric than a brooding, [[Byronic hero|Byronic type]]\", but conceded that the film \"has its moments\".<ref>McGrath, Charles (2011-03-04) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/movies/06eyre.html?_r=1&src=dayp Another Hike on the Moors for \u2018Jane Eyre\u2019], ''[[New York Times]]''</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0116684|Jane Eyre}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|jane_eyre_1996}}\n* [http://janeeyre.net/1996-by-Franco-Zeffirelli.html Review at JaneEyre.net]\n\n{{Jane Eyre}}\n{{Franco Zeffirelli}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:French romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Jane Eyre]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Zeffirelli]]\n[[Category:Films about nannies]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:French films based on novels]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]"}]}}}}
