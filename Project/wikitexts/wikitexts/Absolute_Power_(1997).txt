It was also the last screen appearance of [[E. G. Marshall]]. The scenes in the museum were filmed in the [[Walters Art Museum]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMaster thief Luther Whitney breaks into the mansion of billionaire Walter Sullivan but is forced to hide upon the arrival of Sullivan's wife Christy, on a drunken rendezvous with Alan Richmond, the [[President of the United States]]. Hidden behind the bedroom vault's [[one-way mirror]], Whitney watches in horror as Richmond, who is a sadist, becomes sexually violent; Christy, in self-defense, wounds his arm with a letter opener. Richmond screams for help, and Secret Service agents Bill Burton and Tim Collin burst in, see Christy about to stab the President, and fatally shoot her. [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Gloria Russell arrives, and they stage the scene to look like a [[burglary]] gone wrong. Whitney is unnoticed until he makes his getaway, pursued by the agents, but he manages to escape with millions in valuables as well as the incriminating letter opener.\n\nDetective Seth Frank heads the murder investigation. Though Whitney, known to authorities as a high-profile burglar, becomes a [[prime suspect]], Frank does not believe he is a murderer because he was never a violent criminal. Burton asks Frank to keep him informed on the case and wiretaps Frank's office telephone. Just as Whitney is about to flee the country, he sees Richmond on television publicly commiserating with Sullivan \u2013 a close friend and financial supporter of the president \u2013 on his loss. Incensed, Whitney decides to bring Richmond to justice. He taunts Russell, leaving her a photograph of the letter opener.\n\nWhitney's estranged daughter Kate, a [[prosecutor]], accompanies Frank to Whitney's home in search of clues. Together with Kate, for whom he feels a growing attraction, Seth enters Luther's townhouse and Kate sees the numerous photos of her that line her father's house, including photos where she did not know he was there, which moves her deeply. But the suspicion that he might be Christy Sullivan's murderer gnaws heavily on her and she agrees to set her father up, arranging a meeting at an outdoor caf\u00e9 where the police can take him into custody. Frank guarantees Whitney's safety, but Burton learns of the plan through the wiretap, and both Collin and McCarty \u2013 a [[hitman]] hired by a vengeful Sullivan \u2013 prepare to kill Whitney. The two [[sniper]]s, each unaware of the other, try to shoot Whitney when he meets with Kate. Whitney escapes disguised as a police officer. Whitney later explains to Kate exactly how Christy was killed and by whom.\n\nWhitney tricks Russell into wearing Christy's diamond necklace during a [[White House]] event. Suspecting that Kate must know the truth, Richmond decides she must be eliminated. When Whitney learns from Frank that the Secret Service has taken over surveillance of Kate, he races back to [[Washington, D.C.]] to protect her. Collins then begins ramming Kate's car near a cliff edge, Whitney arrives and pins Collin's vehicle but not before Kate's car falls off a cliff, but she survives. Collin tries again to kill Kate at the hospital with a poison-filled syringe, but Whitney subdues him with a syringe of his own. Collin pleads for mercy, but Whitney delivers a fatal dose.\n\nWhitney replaces Sullivan's chauffeur and tells Sullivan what truly happened the night his wife was killed. Sullivan is unconvinced until Whitney explains how Richmond lied in his speech about Christy's excuse for staying home that night, which he could only have learned from her. He gives Sullivan the letter opener with Richmond's blood and fingerprints and tells him that he has since returned the stolen items.\n\nWhitney drops Sullivan off outside the White House. Sullivan passes through security with the letter opener and enters the [[Oval Office]]. Meanwhile, alerted by Whitney that his phone has been bugged, Frank discovers that a remorseful Burton has committed [[suicide]] and uses the evidence Burton left behind to arrest Russell. On television, the next morning comes the shocking news from Sullivan that Richmond committed suicide by stabbing himself to death. Though not confirmed, it is suggested that Richmond died by Sullivan's hand or Richmond did in fact commit suicide to avoid punishment for his crimes. Whitney is satisfied that justice has prevailed, and happy his daughter is safe and part of his life again.\n\nAt the hospital, Whitney watches over Kate's recovery. Detective Frank visits briefly, whereupon Whitney suggests to Kate that Frank join them for supper sometime.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Luther Whitney\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as President Alan Richmond\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Detective Seth Frank\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Assistant Commonwealth Attorney Kate Whitney\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Secret Service Agent Bill Burton\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Secret Service Agent Tim Collin\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Presidential Chief of Staff Gloria Russell\n* [[E.

[[William Goldman]] was hired to write the screenplay in late 1994. He worked on several drafts through 1995, which he later described in his memoir ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]''<ref>Goldman, William, ''Which Lie Did I Tell?'', Bloomsbury, 2000 p 97-127</ref>\n\nWhen Eastwood first heard of the book being turned into a film, he liked the basic plot and the characters, but disliked that most of those he considered interesting were killed off.  He requested that Goldman make sure that \"everyone the audience likes doesn't get killed off.\"<ref>{{cite journal| last=Blair |first=Iain |title= Clint Eastwood: The Actor-Director Reflects on His Continuing Career and New Film, ''Absolute Power'' |journal= Film & Video |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=70\u201378 |date=March 1997 }}</ref> ''Absolute Power'' was filmed between June and August 1996.\n\nAmong the Washington, D.C. locations used for filming was the apartment of journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]].<ref name=\"Comics Journal Groth\">{{cite news |last1=Groth |first1=Gary |title=My Dinner with Hitch |url=http://www.tcj.com/my-dinner-with-hitch/ |access-date=May 10, 2020 |work=The Comics Journal |date=January 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"CJ Hitchens\">{{cite news |last1=Hitchens |first1=Christopher |title=In Search of the Washington Novel |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/search-washington-novel-13337.html |access-date=May 10, 2020 |work=City Journal |issue=Autumn 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical reception ===\n''Absolute Power'' was met with mixed reviews from critics.
