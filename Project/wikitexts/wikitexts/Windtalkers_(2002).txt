It is based on the real story of [[Navajo]] [[code talker]]s during [[World War II]]. [[C. O. Erickson]] was the executive producer. The film was released in the United States on June 14, 2002, and received mixed reviews and [[Box-office bomb|proved to be financially unsuccessful]], grossing just $77.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $115 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=March 2021}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] corporal Joseph F. \"Joe\" Enders returns to active duty after having survived a gruesome battle [[Solomon Islands campaign|on the Solomon Islands]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] that killed his entire squad and wounded his left ear. Enders and Sgt. Pete \"Ox\" Henderson receive new assignments to protect [[Navajo]] [[code talkers]] Pvt. Ben Yahzee and Pvt. Charlie Whitehorse in a [[Joint assault signal company|JASCO]]. \n\nYahzee and Whitehorse, childhood friends from the Navajo tribe, are trained to send and receive coded messages that direct [[Fire support|artillery fire]]. Enders and Henderson are instructed to kill their code talkers if capture is imminent so that the code cannot fall into enemy hands. Both Enders and Henderson are less than happy to be babysitting their Navajo codetalkers, and the Navajos also endure racial harassment by some of the white Marines, notably Private Chick. During their missions, however, Henderson and Whitehorse discover a mutual love of music. Enders and Yahzee also find that they have much in common, notably their Catholic upbringings.\n\nThe [[Battle of Saipan|invasion of Saipan]] [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|in the Mariana Islands]] becomes Yahzee's and Whitehorse's first combat experience. After the [[beachhead]] is secured, the Marines come under [[friendly fire]] from U.S. artillery. With Yahzee's radio destroyed and the convoy unable to call off the bombardment, Yahzee suggests disguising himself as a Japanese soldier and slip behind enemy lines to commandeer a radio, with Enders as his prisoner. Yahzee is forced to kill for the first time before he can redirect U.S. artillery fire onto the Japanese position. For their bravery, Enders is awarded a [[Silver Star]] by the commanding officer, with Yahzee's role almost ignored until Enders points him out.\n\nThat night, the Marines camp in the nearby village of Tanapag. As Yahzee is temporarily assigned back to the command post to translate a code, Enders becomes increasingly torn over killing Yahzee and following his orders, but his request to be relieved from duty is denied. The next morning, Japanese soldiers ambush the village. Henderson is killed and Whitehorse is about to be captured. Realizing that the Japanese will torture him for the code, Enders throws a grenade at Whitehorse, killing him and his captors. Yahzee returns to Tanapag and, seeing Whitehorse's body, screams at Enders to explain what happened. When Enders mutters that he killed Whitehorse, an outraged Yahzee aims his weapon at Enders but cannot bring himself to kill him. Enders later confesses that he hated having to kill Whitehorse and that, like Henderson, his mission was to protect the code above all else.\n\nThe Marines are sent on another mission and once again ambushed, this time near a deadly minefield on [[Mount Tapochau]], during which many Marines are killed. Enders, Yahzee, Chick, and Cpl. Pappas (the last of the Marines) take cover on a ridge and see Japanese artillery fire from the top of the ridge attacking a Marine convoy below their position. Still enraged over Whitehorse's death, Yahzee charges the Japanese line, killing many Japanese soldiers. Yahzee and Enders are both shot as they call in an airstrike on the Japanese artillery. However, surrounded and knowing the Japanese will capture and torture him for the code as they almost did with Whitehorse, Yahzee begs Enders to kill him. Enders, determined that no one else will die that day, manages to carry Yahzee to safety. Friendly planes arrive and the Japanese position is successfully destroyed. Yahzee rejoices in their success though Enders, mortally wounded, dies.\n\nBack in the U.S., Yahzee and his family sit atop Point Mesa in [[Monument Valley]], Arizona, and, wearing the sacred necklaces and Navajo ceremonial dress, perform the Navajo ritual of paying their respects to Enders.\n\nAn epilogue states that the Navajo code was crucial to America's successes against Japan across the Pacific theater during the war and that like all other Native American codes, the Navajo code was never broken.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sergeant Joe Enders\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Private Ben Yahzee\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Gunnery Sergeant Richard Hjelmsted, Platoon Sergeant\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Private First Class Charles \"Chick\" Clusters, a [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|BAR]] gunner\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Corporal Milo Pappas, a rifleman\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Sergeant Peter \"Ox\" Henderson\n* Roger Willie as Private Charlie Whitehorse\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Private Andrew Harrigan, the flamethrower man\n* [[Martin Henderson]] as Private Thomas Nellie, a rifleman\n* [[Frances O'Connor]] as Pharmacist's Mate 2nd Class Rita\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Major Mellitz\n\n==Production==\nFilming locations on [[Hawaii]] included [[Kualoa Ranch]], the location where ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' were shot. To portray the Marines in the film the producers recruited extras that were volunteers from Schofield Barracks Army Base, Hickam Air Force Base, Pearl Harbor Naval Station, and Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station. Some of the actual Marines from 4th Force Recon Company were used in the film portraying their actual job. Some violence was trimmed in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. This violence trim was restored for the Director's cut released on DVD running 153 minutes. The film's release date was moved from November 9, 2001, to June 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Theatrical_Article.cfm?article_id=1852|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011004122742/http://www.hive4media.com:80/news/html/Theatrical_Article.cfm?article_id=1852|title=MGM Bumps John Woo's WWII Drama 'Windtalkers' From Nov. 9 to June 14|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=October 4, 2001|date=October 1, 2001|access-date=September 21, 2019|via=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] fighters that appear in the beach-landing scenes on Saipan, the producers used computer-generated versions.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date= October 2001 |title= Windtalkers, a 'soulful' story about friendship during war | magazine = In Camera | url = http://www.kodak.com/US/plugins/acrobat/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/windtalkers.pdf | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907074010/http://www.kodak.com/US/plugins/acrobat/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/oct2001/windtalkers.pdf |archive-date= September 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only under $41 million at the US box-office and a total of $77.6 million worldwide, against a production budget of $115 million.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 168 critics.

Unfortunately, the studio wanted a John Wayne movie, just a typical American hero film with explosions every few minutes. I had to make them understand that this wasn't a story about heroes. It's a story about a man and his own demons, trying to redeem himself from war. I made the movie that way, but some people in the studio didn't appreciate it and, in the end, I guess neither did the audience.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |date=2009|title=John Woo on John Woo: My Hits -- and Misses |url=https://ew.com/gallery/john-woo-john-woo-my-hits-and-misses/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!
