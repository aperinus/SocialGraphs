Just as Zelda exclaims something is going to happen, Lucy begins to choke to death on a South Korean chicken ball. The film shows the difficulty of Lucy's loved ones, including Zelda, had in coping with her death. But the grief turns to excitement when Zelda receives a book of [[incantation|spells]] called ''The Wisdom of Catagonia''. Within the book Zelda finds a spell that requires perfect [[astronomy|astronomical]] timing\u2014the moon, the earth, and the [[Sirius|dog star]] must form a perfect [[isosceles triangle]]. Zelda performs the spell and Lucy appears.\n\nLucy begins to reacquaint herself with living and with her family who are shocked to see her alive again, one year later, and soon discovers that she cannot simply pick her life back up where she left off. She returns to find her widower husband has sold their home and married her greedy and double-crossing friend from college. Meanwhile, her son has opened his own successful restaurant and married, instead of going to Columbia.\n\nWhen she returns to the hospital in which she died, the emergency room doctor who tried to revive her begins to fall for her. Zelda confides in the doctor that if Lucy does not find love by the next full moon, she will have to go back to the spirit world. He does not believe Zelda. Eventually, the press finds out that Lucy came back from the dead, and plague her, her family, and the hospital the ER doctor works at. Her college friend becomes jealous of her media attention and the attention Lucy is getting from Mr. Chadman. She holds a news conference of her own and tells the media Lucy made the whole thing up\u2014claiming that Lucy used [[tetrodotoxin]] as a means to fake her own death. Lucy does not defend herself, as she sees this as an opportunity to rid herself and her friends of the media. Instead, the doctor gets fired, her sister's occult store is vandalized and she is hated by almost everyone, except her family. She decides to end the debacle once and for all by tricking her college friend into admitting she lied about Lucy faking her death in front of the media at a party the hospital is having. Lucy, the doctor, and her family walk away happily. As the credits roll, we see that both Lucy and Zelda get married and have children with their new loves. Lucy's son also becomes a father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shelley Long]] as Lucy Chadman\n* [[Judith Ivey]] as Zelda\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Kevin Scanlon\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Jason Chadman\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Kim Lacey\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Junior Lacey\n* [[Carrie Nye]] as Regina Holt\n* Robert Lewis as Phineas Devereaux\n* [[Madeleine Potter]] as Felicity Glick\n* [[Thor Fields]] as Danny Chadman\n* Kate McGregor-Stewart as Reporter #1\n\n==Reception==\n''Hello Again'' was released theatrically by Touchstone Pictures on November 6, 1987.
