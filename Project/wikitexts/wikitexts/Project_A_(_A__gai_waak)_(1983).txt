The film co-stars [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]. ''Project A'' was released theatrically in Hong Kong on December 22, 1983.\n\nSet in the 19th century in [[History of Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|old Hong Kong]], ''Project A'' blends martial arts with comedy moments and spectacular stunts. One stunt in particular involved Chan hanging and falling from the hand of a clock tower some {{cvt|60|ft}} high, tearing through awning canopies before hitting the ground.\n\nThe film was a box office success in [[East Asia]]. At the [[4th Hong Kong Film Awards]], Chan received two nominations for the film (and another for ''[[Wheels on Meals]]''), including his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination, and won his first [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]] award. A sequel, ''[[Project A Part II]]'', was released in 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant Dragon Ma is part of the Hong Kong Marine Police's effort to suppress the pirates, who have been raiding ships for months. Members of the Hong Kong Police Force and the Marine Police, who have strong inter-service rivalries, get into a fight in a bar. Shortly after this, Captain Chi releases all of the sailors to their commanding officer, and two of the Marine Police's ships get blown up.\n\nGangsters Chiang and Mr. Chou meet at a VIP Club and discuss fleeing to Vietnam. As soon as Chiang leaves, he meets one of the pirates and they laugh about sabotaging the Marine Police ships. The pirate tells Chiang that his boss, San-po, wants 100 police rifles.\n\nDragon Ma and his squad are forced to become regular police officers. They have to undergo \"hard training\" with the police under Captain Chi's nephew, Hong Tin-tsu. After the police learn that Chiang is at the VIP Club, and that the guests there are not to be disturbed, Dragon and Tin-tsu go to arrest Chiang. A big fight breaks out. Tiring of the blatant corruption in the police force, Dragon arrests Chiang out and tells Tin-tsu to take the credit. That is his last official act as an officer with the Hong Kong police.\n\nFei finds Dragon in the street. They have a conversation and Fei reveals that someone in the police force is selling rifles. Fei tells Dragon that all he wants are the guns, and Dragon can catch the traitor. At night, Dragon and Fei interrupt a gun deal between the Army and the police Captain. After pushing everyone into the water and making off with the guns, Fei hides the rifles inside a log and marks it with a red flag. He later tries to sell the guns to the gangsters and pirates, but Dragon has removed Fei's red flag and put flags on other logs instead.\n\nHaving thwarted Fei's plan to sell the rifles to the pirates, Dragon has a conversation with the Admiral's daughter, Winnie. He learns that the Captain wasn't smuggling rifles for San-po, he was buying the rifles from the army to arm his men. Overhearing this, Fei gets into an argument with Dragon. The gangsters come after Fei, and he tells them that Dragon is to blame for the missing rifles. Dragon is forced to flee with Winnie. After teaming up with Fei, being tortured for information about the rifles, and falling from the face of a clock tower, Dragon is tracked down by the police for a for a third time, and they help him get away as they arrest the gangsters.\n\nHaving lost the rifles, the pirates take a ship hostage, the passengers including a Rear Admiral. Mr. Chou proposes an arms-for-hostages deal and the Colonel consents. Having overheard the conversation, Dragon confronts the Colonel and convinces him that the gangsters and the pirates will never fear the law if the police force are corrupt. It is agreed that Dragon will assume all responsibility for the mission to save the hostages, and the Colonel allows the Marine Police to be brought back into full force.\n\nMr. Chou is brought in by the police and beaten until he tells Dragon and Tin-tsu how to get to San-po. Dragon, posing as Mr. Chou, gets on board a ship that takes him to San-po's hideout, and they are followed by the rest of the squad. Fei sneaks aboard and poses as a pirate. After a lot of tricky undercover work, the cavalry arrives, and there is a final confrontation in the middle of the pirate's lair. Dragon, Tin-tsu, and Fei engage in a hand-to-hand battle with San-po, eventually killing him with a hand grenade when he's rolled into the carpet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth= |\n* [[Jackie Chan]] - Sergeant Dragon Ma Yue Lung\n* [[Sammo Hung]] - Zhuo Yifei aka Fei / Fats\n* [[Yuen Biao]] - Inspector Hong Tin-Tzu (Captain Chi's Nephew)\n* [[Kwan Hoi-san]] - Captain Chi\n* [[Dick Wei]] - Pirate Chief Lor Sam Pau / San-Po\n* [[Hoi Sang Lee]] - Mr. Lee Cho-Kou\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] - Big Mouth / Jaws\n* Isabella Wong (Wong Man-Ying / Winnie Wong) - Winnie Shih\n* Tai Bo - Tai Bo\n* Lau Hak-suen - Admiral Shih\n* Wong Wai - Chou Wing Ling\n* Hon Yee-sang - Chiang\n* Ng Min-kan - Pirate\n* Kwan Yung-moon - Pirate\n* Chan Chi-fai - Pirate / Policeman\n* Law Ho-kai - Club Manager\n* Cheung Ng-long - Assistant At Club\n* Wan Faat - Assistant At Club\n* [[Wu Ma]] - Mahjong player\n* Lai Keung-kuen - Coast Guard\n* Danny Chow - Ling's thug\n* Johnny Cheung - Ling's thug\n* [[Lola Forner]] - British Admiral's Daughter\n* Chris Li - Pirate\n* Sam Wong - Pirate\n* To Wai-wo as Policeman\n* [[Chin Kar-lok]] - Police Coast Employee (extra)\n* Steve Mak (extra)\n* Frankie Poon (extra)\n* A.

She has film credits for cameo appearances in the sequel ''[[Project A Part II]]'' and in ''[[Police Story 2]]''.\n\n===Title===\nIn the 1980s, Chan chose vague, generic film titles such as ''Project A'' and ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'' so as not to give the plots of the films away prior to their release. It was felt that the titles of previous Chan films such as ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'' gave too much away about the kung fu style they featured (Snake Style and [[Zui Quan|Drunken Fist]] respectively). ''Project A'' was originally going to be titled ''Pirate Patrol'', but it was feared that once announced, other Hong Kong film producers would rush to copy and release films featuring pirates.<ref name=\"ProjectA\">{{cite video | title = Project A, Audio commentary (Bey Logan), Project A: A Classic Revisited, Disc 2 | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Hong Kong Legends]]| place= UK}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2021}}\nOn the audio commentary of the [[Hong Kong Legends]] (Region 2) DVD, Bey Logan reveals that Chan's last period film, ''[[Dragon Lord]]'' (1982), had under-performed at the Hong Kong box office in comparison to the previous one, ''[[The Young Master]]'' (1980). Logan identifies that a possible reason for the poor performance was the comparative lack of action. Edward Tang and the production team felt that a period film could still have success if it had sufficient action, and so researched the history of Hong Kong during the time of pirates for ''Project A''.\n\nUnlike other Hollywood period films that are set on an exact time and place, many Hong Kong films play fast and loose with their period in history. A prominent example by Bey Logan is set like this: the Hong Kong Marine Police is set up in 1846 by the British Colonial Government. The Hong Kong Headquarters is set up in 1884. The Kowloon Canton Railway Clock tower is set up in 1915. So in other words, this film takes place between the 19th and early 20th century. Jackie and the Golden Harvest team employ some researchers to come up with background for this story about pirates in Hong Kong and are not really concerned at all about depicting the film in the exact era. Bey Logan coined regarding historical heroes and stories like Wong Fei Hong: if you choose between the truth and the legend, you print the legend because if you pick the truth, you won't have for example, having items, vehicles and certain historical figures if you are shooting it in a time where certain things would or would not have existed, unless it's made as a documentary.\n\n''Project A'' marks the first time that veteran Michael Lai used orchestral music for a film score, instead of using library music or lifting the score from other films.\n\nIn rehearsal for the clock tower fall, Chan took a week to build the courage to drop from such a great height.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} During the shooting of the bicycle chase sequence, one of the stuntmen informed Chan that ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' was playing at the local cinema. Chan halted filming to watch the bicycle chase scene in the finale of ''E.T.'', to ensure that his scene and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s scene were not the same. After watching the film, Chan became more confident, realizing that the audience doesn't really care so much about such minor details, only in watching the film and having a good time. According to his book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', Chan injured his neck while filming the scene.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing | first= Jackie |last= Chan |publisher=[[Random House]] |access-date=2012-12-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100218151637/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |archive-date= 18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter appearing in ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), Chan liked the idea of including [[blooper]]s over the [[closing credits]]. Beginning with ''Dragon Lord'', he has included (and directed) outtakes over the end credits for most of his films, including ''Project A'', and they have become something of a Chan trademark. Due to the nature of his films, Chan's outtakes are a combination of comedic moments and injuries sustained whilst he and his team perform stunts and fight sequences. These outtakes were enjoyed particularly by audiences in Japan\u2014so much so that Japanese film companies would demand the inclusion of \"NGs\" (\"no good\" shots) in the distribution contracts for all Jackie Chan films, regardless of director.\n\nWhile some of Chan's comedy stunt work in ''Project A'' has similarities to the comedy stunt work of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]], Chan had not seen their films at the time, as they were not available on [[home video]]. According to Chan, ''Project A'' was an evolution of the action stunt work he had already been doing in earlier kung fu comedy films since ''[[The Young Master]]'' (1980). He only became aware of Keaton later from Western critics who watched ''Project A'' and drew comparisons, after which Chan watched Keaton's films when they eventually became available on home video and realized how similar Keaton is to himself.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Havis |first1=Richard James |title=Jackie Chan on Project A, the martial arts film that set a creative template for his decades of show business success |url= https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3088719/jackie-chan-project-martial-arts-film-set-creative-template |access-date=30 December 2020 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=14 June 2020 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cbQynPvGnfkJ:www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3088719/jackie-chan-project-martial-arts-film-set-creative-template&strip=1 |archive-date=30 December 2020 |quote=Critics often compare your work in ''Project A'' to that of silent film stars like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.
