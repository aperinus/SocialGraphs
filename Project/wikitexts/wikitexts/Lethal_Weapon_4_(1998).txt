Glover and Gibson will reprise their roles as Riggs and Murtaugh, with Gibson also in talks to direct.\n\n==Plot==\nLorna Cole is pregnant with [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Martin Riggs' baby; they are not married, but both are thinking about it. LAPD Sergeant Roger Murtaugh's daughter Rianne, is also pregnant. Due to issues with the department's insurance carrier over Riggs and Murtaugh's actions as sergeants, the Police Chief has Captain Murphy promote them to captains.\n\nThe officers along with Leo Getz come upon a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] immigrant smuggling ring after running an ocean-going vessel aground, though the captain of the boat escapes. In the subsequent investigation, Murtaugh finds Hong and his family hiding from US Immigration officers to avoid deportation. Murtaugh offers them shelter in his home, and their families, along with Riggs and Cole, quickly bond. Hong reveals he is looking for his uncle, a skilled engraver, who had paid for their passage to the United States. Riggs discovers through Lorna that Murtaugh's yet-to-be-born grandchild from Rianne is by Detective Lee Butters, which Murtaugh cannot possibly tolerate as he did not want his daughter to marry a police officer, and that Murtaugh still does not know who the father is due to the family hiding it from him.\n\nContinued investigation of the smuggling ring leads the officers to \"Uncle\" Benny Chan, a crime boss operating from a [[Chinatown]] restaurant. There, they are introduced to high-ranking [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] negotiator Wah Sing Ku. Chan forces them out of his restaurant when the officers show no probable cause. Riggs steals an umbrella from a counter in the restaurant and pulls the fire alarm so that the sprinklers go on, forcing all the restaurant customers to flee.  Outside, Riggs spots the escaped captain and tries to give chase but fails to capture him. However, Ku later intercepts the captain and kills him as punishment for attracting the police's attention. Chan and Ku take steps to eliminate all those in on their plans.\n\nHong is able to contact his uncle, but this leads the Triads to Murtaugh's house. Ku and the Triad thugs kidnap the Hongs, tie up Murtaugh, his family, Riggs and Cole and set the house ablaze. Ping, Hong's grandson, has evaded capture and helps to free the others in time. Though Riggs and Murtaugh chase down and kill some of the Triad members, Ku escapes. Ku brings Hong to his uncle at a warehouse, where he has been engraving plates for a counterfeiting operation for Ku and Chan in exchange for transit for his family. Ku kills Hong in front of his uncle to assure his continued work.\n\nWith Getz serving as a distraction, the officers confront Chan at his dentist's office to interrogate him with [[laughing gas]] for more information but are unable to get any leads, and during which Riggs and Butters accidentally reveal the family secret to Murtaugh. Later, as they discuss what they know with Detective Ng, who has worked on cases involving the Chinese government before, Ng recognizes that Ku must be trying to negotiate with a corrupt Chinese general for the release of the Four Fathers, high-ranking Triad members that include Ku's brother. New information leads them to the abandoned warehouse where they find the bodies of Hong, his uncle, and Chan, the latter two killed by Ku after they served their usefulness. Knowing that Ku plans to use counterfeit money, the police intercept the exchange between Ku and the general, telling the general that the money is fake. The enraged general reacts by executing most of the Four Fathers before being shot and killed by the Triads, at which a firefight breaks out between the Triad, the general's private army and the police, and most of the Triad and army are killed; and Butters is wounded shielding Murtaugh. Ku attempts to escape with his brother, but his brother is shot and killed by Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh pursue Ku to a pier where they engage him in a brutal fistfight. Murtaugh impales Ku through the stomach with a rebar before being knocked out by Ku, after which the pier collapses and sends Riggs and Ku into the water. Riggs is able to find a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifle and finish off Ku, while Murtaugh recovers in time to rescue Riggs from a piece of concrete that had pinned him underwater.\n\nLater, Riggs visits his dead wife's grave and asks her for advice about his impending marriage with Lorna, about which he still has doubts; Getz arrives and offers a heartfelt childhood story that gives Riggs both a new light on the situation and a new perspective of Getz. They soon discover Lorna is about to give birth and race to the hospital, where Riggs and Lorna are ceremonially married by a [[rabbi]] just before she enters labor. Their son and Rianne's daughter are born, and Murtaugh accepts Butters as his son-in-law. Murphy gives Riggs and Murtaugh their rank of Sergeant back since the city is insured again and Hong's family is granted [[right of asylum|asylum]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Martin Riggs]]\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[Roger Murtaugh]]\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Leo Getz\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Lorna Cole\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Detective Lee Butters\n* [[Jet Li]] as Wah Sing Ku\n* [[Kim Chan]] as Uncle Benny Chan\n* [[Steve Kahan]] as Captain Ed Murphy\n* [[Calvin Jung]] as Detective Ng\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as U.S. State Department Official\n* [[Eddy Ko]] as Hong, Chinese Refugee\n* [[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Dr. Stephanie Woods\n* [[Conan Lee]] as Ku's brother\n* [[Darlene Love]] as Trish Murtaugh\n* [[Traci Wolfe]] as Rianne Murtaugh-Butters\n* Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh\n* Ebonie Smith as Carrie Murtaugh\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Rabbi Gelb\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn early 1993, a year after the release and big success of ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'', Warner Bros. and producer [[Joel Silver]] tried buying new spec script by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] titled ''Simon Says'', which was about police detective and shop owner who are forced by mad bomber to search and stop the bombs he planted all over the city, as part of his big revenge plan against the detective. Silver and Warner Bros. wanted to get the script and re-write it into ''Lethal Weapon 4'', however 20th Century Fox bought the script instead and originally they planned for it to be [[Brandon Lee]]'s next film after ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' or have it be re-written into sequel to his previous action film, ''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]''. But after Lee's death during filming of ''The Crow'', Fox instead took ''Simon Says'' script and used it for third ''Die Hard'' film they had trouble developing at the time, and after many re-writes done by several writers, it was finally made into ''[[Die Hard With a Vengeance]]'' (1995).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-strange-history-of-the-die-hard-movies/|title = The Strange History of the die Hard Movies|date = December 2019}}</ref> In July 1993,  Warner Bros. and Silver started working on not just the fourth film, but the fifth one as well. Screenwriter and script doctor [[Jonathan Lemkin]], who has just done some uncredited work for them on ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993), was hired to write the script for ''Lethal Weapon 4'' while another writer wrote the script for ''Lethal Weapon 5''. According to Silver, originally it was planned to film both films back-to-back, or use best parts from both scripts into one film.\n<ref>L.A.

When asked about director Richard Donner\u2019s plans for two more sequels, Gibson puts his head in his hands and makes a snoring sound. \"My answer to more Lethal Weapons? Nah,\" he says. \"I know that there\u2019re two scripts out there. My suggestion is that they change the title to Die Hard 3 and 4. Call the scripts Angry Bruce Willis 4. I\u2019m not interested now.\"</ref>\n\nBetween late 1994 and early 1995, screenwriter [[Jeffrey Boam]], who did some uncredited work on first ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' (1987), re-wrote original ''Play Dirty'' script for ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' by [[Shane Black]] and [[Warren Murphy]], and wrote the story and script for ''Lethal Weapon 3'', was brought in to re-write ''Lethal Weapon 4'' script which Warner Bros. were going to use for the film, but Boam had some problems with it, and he also wasn't sure about working on another ''Lethal Weapon'' film after bad experience he had with last film, like having to keep re-writing it during filming and even getting fired at one point only to be re-hired later. Then later on he started working on his own new story for ''Lethal Weapon 4'', which would have Riggs and Murtaugh fighting against neo-nazi survivalists who are committing terrorist attacks on L.A., like using Stinger missiles to try and shoot down the jet carrying Los Angeles Lakers. Boam wrote the first version of the script in January 1995, and he said in an interview how he would probably have to write at least three more drafts. By October 1995, Boam was still working on the script, and at the same time he was also working on fourth ''Indiana Jones'' film which was left unproduced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.com/2009/09/jeffrey-boam-interview-1992.html|title = The Occasional Critic: The Jeffrey Boam interview, 1992|date = 24 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.com/2009/09/jeffrey-boam-interview-june-1995.html|title = The Occasional Critic: Jeffrey Boam interview, June 1995|date = 30 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe book ''The Gross: The Hits, The Flops: The Summer That Ate Hollywood'' by Peter Bart, went into lot of details regarding the film's troubled production, from writing to release. While Boam was still working on his version of the story for ''Lethal Weapon 4'' about neo-nazi survialists, other writers were writing their own versions, all of which were rejected. Finally, Warner Bros. decided that they wanted for fourth film to focus on storyline involving Triads, so despite them and many other people really liking Boam's version and how he went back to the serious, darker and edgier tone of first film, it was rejected for those reasons. Boam would later say how he felt that the main plot Warner Bros. went with in final film about counterfeiting of Chinese money wasn't good or suspenseful enough plot for ''Lethal Weapon'' sequel.\n\nJonathan Lemkin was once again brought in to write the first version of the script involving Triads, about four years after he wrote his first rejected version of ''Lethal Weapon 4'' script in 1993, and although his new script was received very positively, once again other writers were brought in to write other versions of the story. [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] wrote one of the unused scripts, but for some reason they still have story credit in the film.\n\nJoel Silver brought in TV writer [[Channing Gibson]] to work on the script, after he was impressed by Gibson's re-write of 1993 spec script by another screenwriter [[Steven Maeda]] titled ''Sandblast'', an action adventure thriller described as \"''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988) meets ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' (1993) in a sandstorm\", about ex-specialist who's also explosives expert leading the commando team into Iraq desert wasteland to search and recover lost nuclear warheads before traitorous team of green berets finds them first, and while dealing with deadly terrain and huge sandstorm. ''Sandblast'' was another Warner Bros. project on which Silver worked as producer between 1995 and 1996 when it was in production, and originally [[Eddie Murphy]] was going to star in completely serious action role, but after he left, [[Wesley Snipes]] was cast in the lead and for $10 million paycheck, and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was going to play the main villain, however despite it having about $42 million budget and going into pre-production with cast and crew ready to start working in Morocco where sets were already built, ''Sandblast'' was cancelled in 1996 due to several different problems, and due to his \"pay or play\" deal, Snipes instead starred in ''[[Murder at 1600]]'' (1997).\n\nGibson took the job of writing ''Lethal Weapon 4'' mostly because he thought it would be more relaxed writing job than anything he did for TV, however much like what happened on previous two sequels, the script kept getting changed and re-written over and over again, and Gibson ended up doing more work and revisions on it than on all of his TV work put together. Production even started without half of the script finished, and ending wasn't written until it was finally time to film it.\n\nLeo Getz and Lee Butters weren't in original scripts, but then [[Joe Pesci]] was hired and paid $1 million for three weeks of work, and Gibson was \"three-fourths\" through his newest draft when [[Chris Rock]] was hired, which forced him to re-write the script yet again. Butters was originally written to be a gay detective, but immediately when they started filming police station scene between him, Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo, everyone felt how his character didn't work so he was changed and re-written to be Rianne's husband, although they only share one scene in the final film and never say anything to each other, due to last minute changes made on his character.\n\nBesides Lemkin, Gibson, Gough and Millar, some other writers did uncredited work on the script, including Michael Curtis, [[Greg Malins]], [[Fred Dekker]] (who came up with the scene where Riggs and Murtaugh drive their car off the freeway and through the building), and even Boam was brought in to work on the script.\n\nMovie went into production in very early January 1998 and with already planned summer release of that same year, but due to issues during filming including the script changes, production ended around mid May, less than two months before its scheduled July release. Editors had to work very quickly to have the film ready, which is why the trailers for it show some deleted and alternate scenes which are not in the film. But despite this, the film was finished and released as planned.<ref>The Gross: The Hits, The Flops: The Summer That Ate Hollywood by Peter Bart</ref><ref>Maximum Impact: The Legacy of Lethal Weapon - Lethal Weapon Blu-ray Collection</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-ridiculously-fast-turnaround-time-of-lethal-weapon-4/|title=The Ridiculously Fast Turnaround Time of Lethal Weapon 4|date=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Lethal Weapon 4'' debuted at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 at the box office with $34.05 million.<ref>https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1998&wknd=28&p=.htm BOM</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Action-Hero Films Have $70-Million Blast; Box office: 'Lethal 4' opens at No. 1, 'Soldiers' in third, as 'Armageddon' stays solid.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 13, 1998|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/13/entertainment/ca-3234|access-date=December 7, 2010|first=Richard|last=Natale}}</ref> Although the film grossed $130 million in the U.S., it was not considered a runaway financial success as the previous three films had been.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Lethal' Has a Winning Formula|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 1998|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/14/entertainment/ca-3440|access-date=September 11, 2010|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}</ref> Shooting began in January 1998, just months before the film's release, with a production budget estimated at $120\u2013$150 million (although [[Warner Bros.]] maintained it cost less than $100 million)<ref name=\"Wolk (1998)\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,83595,00.html |title=Lethal Weapon 4 |author=Josh Wolk |date=July 13, 1998 |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> and an additional $50 million spent on marketing and distribution.<ref name=\"Natale (1998)\">{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/14/business/fi-3512 |title=Lethal Comes Out Shooting but Stars Will Drain Profit |author=Richard Natala |date=July 14, 1998 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> This made the fourth film the most expensive entry of the series.
