It was directed by David Hogan, produced by [[Brad Wyman]], and written by [[Chuck Pfarrer]] and [[Ilene Chaiken]]. The film stars [[Pamela Anderson]] in the titular role, alongside [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Victoria Rowell]], [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Udo Kier]], and [[Steve Railsback]]. Although ''Barb Wire'' was panned by critics, it has attracted a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2017, during the [[Second American Civil War]], [[Barb Wire (character)|Barb Wire]] owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in [[Steel Harbor]], \"the last free city\" in a [[United States]] ravaged by the war. She earns cash as a mercenary and bounty hunter. Chief of Police Willis raids her club. Willis's target is fugitive Dr. Corrina 'Cora D' Devonshire, a former government scientist with information about a new bioweapon called Red Ribbon being developed by her former superiors in the Congressional Directorate. The Congressional Council has tasked Colonel Victor Pryzer with finding Dr. Devonshire so they can end the Second Civil War by releasing the virus on the United Front territories. Dr. Devonshire hopes to escape to [[Canada]] to make this information public.\n\nDevonshire turns up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood, a \"[[Resistance movement|freedom fighter]]\" Barb had loved at the outbreak of the war. The two were separated during the conflict. Axel tries to help Cora get to Canada. They try to find a contraband pair of [[contact lens]]es that would allow Cora to evade the [[retinal scan]] identification at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.\n\nRather than give the lenses to Cora and Axel, Barb makes a deal with 'Big Fatso', the leader of a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] gang: Fatso wants the lenses, which are worth a fortune on the black market, and Barb wants a million dollars and an armed escort to the airport, where ''she'' plans to get on the plane to Canada. But Fatso double-crosses Barb; when Barb, Axel and Cora show up at the junkyard to make the swap, Colonel Pryzer and his storm troopers are also there, along with Chief of Police Willis. Willis makes a show of arresting Barb and Cora, but instead of putting [[handcuffs]] on Barb, he slips her a hand grenade. Barb uses the grenade to kill Fatso and cause enough confusion to allow Barb, Axel, Cora and Willis to pile into Barb's armored van and lead the Congressionals on a [[car chase]], culminating in a hand-to-hand fight between Barb and Colonel Pryzer on a forklift suspended by crane above the harbor. Pryzer falls to his death while Barb escapes.\n\nThe party makes it to the airport, where Barb reveals she still has the contact lenses. She gives them to Cora, and Cora and Axel get on the plane to Canada while Willis and Barb remain on the rainswept tarmac.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Pamela Anderson|Pamela Anderson Lee]] as Barbara \"Barb Wire\" Kopetski\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Axel Hood\n* [[Victoria Rowell]] as Dr. Corrina \"Cora D\" Devonshire\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Charlie Kopetski \n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Chief Alexander Willis\n* [[Udo Kier]] as \"Curly\"\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Colonel Victor Pryzer\n* Mary Anna Reyes as Woman In Torture Room\n* [[Andre Rosey Brown]] as \"Big Fatso\"\n* [[Nicholas Worth]] as Ruben Tannenbaum\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Schmitz\n* Nils Allen Stewart as Jack\n* [[Henry Kingi]] as Moe\n* Mark Collver as Manny\n* Jennifer Banko as \"Spike\"\n* Loren Rubin as Willie Krebs\n* Peewee Piemonte as Officer Frick\n* [[Dominiquie Vandenberg]] as Officer Frack\n* [[Tony Bill]] as Foster\n* Michael Russo as Mr. Santos\n* Shelly Desai as Sharif\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Sheik\n* [[John Paxton]] as \"Smooth\"\n* [[Neil Hunt]] as \"Weasel\"\n* Ken Fosgren as \"Greaseball\"\n* [[Tom Lister Jr.]] as Bouncer\n* Teo as Disc Jockey\n* Ai Wan as \"China\"\n* Diane Warshay as Maria\n* [[Candace Kita]] as Dancer\n* Diane Shay as Stripper In Dressing Room\n* Adriana Alexander as Redhead\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n''Barb Wire'' was directed by David Hogan, who had previously been the second-unit director on ''[[Alien 3]]'' and ''[[Batman Forever]]''.<ref name=\"NYT review\"/> The film had a production budget of $9 million.<ref name=\"Striptease scene\"/> Anderson did some of her own stunts, even though she was afraid of heights.

[[Roger Ebert]] pointed out that the film's plot was identical to that of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and derided the low-brow attempts at sensuality, but praised the cast and crew's approach to the material: \"The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. ''Barb Wire'' has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun\". He gave it two and a half stars.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960503/REVIEWS/605030301 |title=Roger Ebert - ''Chicago Sun-Times'' |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1996-05-03 |access-date=2011-02-09 |archive-date=2011-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513081855/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19960503%2FREVIEWS%2F605030301 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly to Ebert, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on the film's aping of the ''Casablanca'' plot and its \"teasing, hollow 'naughtiness'\", but further said that the film is lacking in energy.
