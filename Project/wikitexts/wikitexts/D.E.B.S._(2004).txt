Women who score highly on the test are recruited into D.E.B.S. (Discipline, Energy, Beauty, Strength), a clandestine [[paramilitary]] academy. Four D.E.B.S.\u2014squad leader Max, na\u00efve Janet, promiscuous Dominique, and Amy, who dreams of attending art school despite being the academy's top recruit\u2014are tasked by Ms. Petrie and Mr. Phipps, the heads of D.E.B.S., to surveil Lucy Diamond. Diamond is an infamous supercriminal, known for her operations, thefts, an alleged attempt to sink Australia, as well as supposedly killing every agent that goes up against her. Amy in particular is interested in Lucy due to writing a [[senior thesis]] about her. It is believed that Lucy is meeting Russian assassin Ninotchka Kaprova. Unbeknownst to them, Lucy is a rather neurotic woman, who has trouble opening up to people. Her meeting with Ninotchka is, in fact, a [[blind date]].\n\nIn the meantime, Amy has recently broken up with her pushy and controlling boyfriend, Bobby, a fellow agent. The D.E.B.S. observe Lucy's date with Ninotchka, and are interrupted by Bobby, who is on his own stakeout, with several intelligence agencies also observing Lucy. Lucy has trouble connecting with Ninotchka, and tries to call off the date. Amy gets into an argument with Bobby, demanding answers on their breakup, which catches Lucy's attention. A shootout ensues, and Lucy flees while being chased by the D.E.B.S. Lucy is caught in a standoff with Amy, but they end up having a friendly conversation. Lucy escapes when Amy's attention wavers, and the D.E.B.S. praise Amy for being the only person to have ever faced Lucy and lived.\n\nLucy quickly takes a liking to Amy, and against the advice of her friend and henchman, Scud, sneaks into Amy's dorm. Lucy initially says she wants to help Amy on her thesis, but ends up coercing her into joining her at a nightclub, along with Janet, who witnesses Lucy speaking with Amy. During this trip, Lucy and Amy grow closer and have a conversation about their lives and relationships. Lucy even clarifies that the deaths of the agents sent after her were happenstance. Janet and Scud also befriend each other. When the two open up to each other, Lucy and Amy are about to kiss, but are interrupted by Janet.\n\nLater, Amy is promoted to squad leader, replacing Max, much to Max's jealousy. Ms. Petrie plans on using Amy's encounter with Lucy to boost the D.E.B.S. image and reputation. Amy is hesitant to talk about her encounter due to her growing feelings for Lucy. The D.E.B.S. respond to a bank heist orchestrated by Lucy, which she has committed in order to see Amy again. When Lucy and Amy are alone, the two kiss, and Lucy talks Amy into running off with her. The D.E.B.S. assume Amy has been kidnapped and organize a nationwide manhunt to find her. In the meantime, Lucy and Amy enjoy having an actual relationship with one another, while Janet covers for them (and also develops feelings for Scud, whom she has a secret correspondence with).\n\nOn the basis of a tip from a jealous Ninotchka, the D.E.B.S. and Bobby discover Amy and Lucy while they are having sex. When Amy returns to the academy, Ms. Petrie prepares to exile Amy, but Max convinces her to claim that Amy was kidnapped and [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] in order to protect their reputation. Amy becomes depressive when forced to go along with the story, and Bobby tries to coerce Amy into getting back together with him. When Lucy tries to see Amy again, Amy is forced to reject her. In the meantime, Lucy comes to realize she is not happy with her life of crime. In an attempt to win Amy back, Lucy returns everything she has ever stolen, and publicly turns over a new leaf.\n\nAt the time of the D.E.B.S. year-end dance, Amy is to be made D.E.B. of the year and deliver a speech where she is to denounce Lucy. Janet talks with Dominique and Max, who start to realize how unhappy Amy actually is. Lucy infiltrates the academy during the dance. When Bobby discovers this, he plans to track her down and kill her. Lucy evades Bobby only to hear Amy's speech about her experience as Lucy's captive. When Amy and Lucy meet eyes, Amy retracts her entire speech, and runs off-stage to be with Lucy. Petrie, Bobby and the rest of the academy try to track them down, when Lucy and Amy are cornered by Max, Janet, and Dominique. At Amy's insistence, they give their blessings to Lucy and Amy, and allow them to make their escape. Lucy and Amy ride off into the night, heads on one another's shoulders.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sara Foster]] as Amy Bradshaw\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] as Lucy Diamond\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Max Brewer\n* [[Devon Aoki]] as Dominique\n* [[Jill Ritchie]] as Janet\n* [[Geoff Stults]] as Bobby Matthews\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Scud\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Ms. Petrie\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Mr. Phipps\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Ninotchka Kaprova\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as stoner\n* [[Aimee Garcia]] as Maria\n* [[Jennifer Carpenter]] as hysterical student\n}}\n\nRitchie was the only cast member from the short film to reprise her role in the expansion.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Inception {{Anchor|Writing}} ===\nDirector, writer, and editor [[Angela Robinson (filmmaker)|Angela Robinson]] began to draw comics about the D.E.B.S. in college as a sideline to her writing.<ref>[[Angela Robinson (filmmaker)|Robinson, Angela]], et al. \"Infiltrating the D.E.B.S.\" ([[Featurette]]) DVD.

It's gay in what might be called a homo-normative way.
