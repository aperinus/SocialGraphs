It didn't see a general release until it was released in France on 15 June 2011, followed by Kazakhstan and Russia in July 2011, and the United States, Canada and India on 31 August 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in [[Tel Aviv]] for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.\n\nIn 1965, young [[Mossad]] agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in [[East Berlin]] to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel\u2014infamously known as \"The Surgeon of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]]\" for his [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiment]]s on [[Jews]] during [[World War II]]\u2014and bring him to [[Israel]] to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from [[Argentina]] and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] clinic.\n\nRachel plans to have a gynecological exam at Vogel\u2019s clinic. In order to present herself as a married woman who has had a recent sexual experience, she wants to sleep with David but does not explain why. Although the two have feelings for each other, David resists her overtures. Instead, she sleeps with Stefan.\n\nAt the appointment and during an uncomfortable pelvic exam, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative and convinces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and take off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. When gunfire erupts, David saves the compromised Rachel. The Mossad agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.\n\nThe agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel while leaving him chained to the wall heater. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a bowl over Vogel's head and starts repeatedly to beat him. Rachel runs in and tries to stop him but David unknowingly hits her while still hitting Vogel. David is finally restrained and pulled out of the room by Stefan.\n\nRachel goes into the bathroom to wash the blood off her face leaving Vogel alone. Vogel surreptitiously grabs a shard of the broken bowl and starts cutting through his bonds. When Rachel returns to the room Vogel attacks her with the shard, throwing her against the wall and knocking her unconscious. Vogel opens the front door, runs down the stairs and escapes.\n\nStefan, panicking and hoping to avoid humiliation, comes up with a fictional story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel because he was trying to escape and they were able to get rid of the body. Rachel insists they cannot lie about what happened but David, who is blaming himself for Vogel escaping, agrees to lie. Stefan pushes Rachel to reluctantly agree.\n\nWhen Rachel discovers she is pregnant, she marries Stefan, the father of her child, although she loves David. In the following years, the agents are venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission. \n\nA generation later, at a dinner celebrating their daughter's book release, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at David's flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel is in a mental hospital in [[Ukraine]], and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist.\n\nStefan claims David killed himself because he was a coward. Rachel refutes Stefan's explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel so he could finally be brought to justice. He was further disheartened by Rachel's admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter.\n\nNevertheless, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to [[Kyiv]]. She investigates the journalist's lead and is able to travel to the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is not him. Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and suddenly spots the real Vogel among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital.\n\nAfter a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned syringe into his back. Later Rachel's note is discovered and read by the journalist. It describes the truth of the mission, ready to be relayed to the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Rachel Singer in 1997\n** [[Jessica Chastain]] as Rachel Singer in 1965 and 1970\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as David Peretz in 1997\n** [[Sam Worthington]] as David Peretz in 1965 and 1970\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Stefan Gold in 1997\n** [[Marton Csokas]] as Stefan Gold in 1965 and 1970\n* [[Jesper Christensen]] as Dieter Vogel\n* [[Romi Aboulafia]] as Sarah Gold\n* [[Yonatan Uziel]] as Mossad Agent\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIsraeli papers reported that Mirren was \"immersing herself\" in studies of the [[Hebrew language]], Jewish history and Holocaust writings, including the life of [[Simon Wiesenthal]], while spending time in Israel in 2009 to shoot scenes in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/mirren-learning-hebrew-for-movie-role_1096343|title=Mirren Learning Hebrew For Movie Role|date=27 February 2009|website=Contactmusic.com|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> \"My character is carrying the memory, anger and passion of the Holocaust,\" she said.<ref>Pilkington, Mark (August 2011). \"Helen Mirren's Secret\", ''[[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex Magazine]]''.</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Deauville American Film Festival]] in France on 4 September 2010, followed by [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 14 September 2010,<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/tiff/tiff-rolling-out-films-that-cannes-missed/article1653586 \"TIFF Rolling Out Films that Cannes Missed\"].
