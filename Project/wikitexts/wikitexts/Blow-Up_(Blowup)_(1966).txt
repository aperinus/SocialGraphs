He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he departs the studio, two teenaged girls who are aspiring models ask to speak to him, but Thomas drives off to visit at an [[antique shop]].\n\nWandering into [[Maryon Park]], Thomas takes photos of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed, and pursues Thomas, demands his film, and ultimately tries to snatch his camera. He refuses and photographs her as she runs away through a [[meadow]]. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, Jane arrives, asking desperately for the film. She and Thomas have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different film roll. She, in turn, writes down a false telephone number and gives it to him.\n\nThomas, curious, makes multiple zooms of the black-and-white film of Jane and her lover. They reveal Jane worriedly looking at a third person lurking in the trees with a [[pistol]]. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life. Thomas is disturbed by a knock on the door, and it is the two girls again, with whom he has a romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them, but he realizes there may be more to the photographs in the park. He tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\"\n\nFurther examination of a blurred figure under a bush makes Thomas suspect the man in the park may have been murdered after all, during the time Thomas was arguing with the woman around the bend.\n\nAs evening falls, the photographer goes back to the park and finds the body of the man, but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking, as if being stepped on. Thomas returns to find his studio ransacked. All the negatives and prints are gone except for one very grainy blowup of what is possibly the body.\n\nAfter driving into town, he sees the woman and follows her into a club where [[The Yardbirds]], featuring both [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Jeff Beck]] on guitar and [[Keith Relf]] on vocals, are seen performing the song \"Stroll On\".  A buzz in Beck's [[amplifier]] angers him so much, he smashes his guitar on stage, then throws its neck into the crowd. A riot ensues. The photographer grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him. Then, he has second thoughts about it, throws it on the pavement, and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck and throws it back down, not realizing it is from Beck's guitar. Thomas never locates the elusive woman.\n\nAt a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near [[central London]], the photographer finds Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to [[Paris]]; when confronted, she says she is in Paris. Thomas asks Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened because Ron is incredibly [[Substance intoxication|stoned]]. Instead, Thomas joins the party and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.\n\nBefuddled, Thomas watches a [[Mime artist|mime]] troupe perform a [[tennis]] match, is drawn to it, after a bit picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players. As he watches the mime, the sound of the ball being played is heard and his image fades away, leaving only the grass as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Thomas\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Jane\n* [[Sarah Miles]] as Patricia\n* [[John Castle]] as Bill\n* [[Jane Birkin]] as the Blonde\n* [[Gillian Hills]] as the Brunette\n* [[Peter Bowles]] as Ron\n* [[Veruschka von Lehndorff]] as herself\n* [[Julian Chagrin]] as Mime\n* Claude Chagrin as Mime\n* Susan Brodrick as Antique Shop Owner ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] as Thomas's receptionist ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Jill Kennington]] as Model ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Peggy Moffitt]] as Model ''(uncredited)''\n* Harry Hutchinson as Shopkeeper ''(uncredited)''\n* Reg Wilkins as Thomas's Assistant ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Janet Street-Porter]] as Dancing Girl in Club ''(uncredited)''\n}}\n\n==Inspirations and Influences==\nThe plot of ''Blowup'' was inspired by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s short story \"Las babas del diablo\" (1959),<ref name=\"Beltzer\" /> collected in the book ''[[End of the Game and Other Stories]]'', in turn based on a story told to Cort\u00e1zar by photographer [[Sergio Larra\u00edn]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forn|first1=Juan|title=El rect\u00e1ngulo en la mano|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/contratapa/13-187760-2012-02-17.html|website=[[P\u00e1gina 12]]|access-date=11 August 2017|language=es}}</ref> Subsequently, the short story was retitled \"Blow Up\" to connect it with the film.<ref name=\"Beltzer\" /> The life of [[Swinging London]] photographer [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]] was also an influence.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Brigitte|last1=Tast|first2=Hans-J\u00fcrgen|last2=Tast|title=light room \u2013 dark room.

As Thomas persists in his role as amateur detective, his quest leads him initially to question his technical mastery over the \u201chidden truth\u201d recorded by his camera, then toward a confrontation with the realities of his life\u2014a life of \u201cmaterial advantages, gained at the expense of ideals.\u201d Finally, the conflicted young man questions the reality of his own existence.<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 100: See here for Gow\u2019s profile of the Thomas character both socially and sexually, emphasizing Thomas\u2019 cynicism/misanthropy, and \u201cat the same time reaching out rather blindly for toward spiritual fulfillment.\u201d</ref> Film historian Gordan Gow identifies the object in Antonioni's use of suspense: \n \n{{blockquote|\u201cIn the case of Blow-up, the mystery [i.e. whether a murder took place] is relevant to the film, but the solution of it is not. Indeed, the absence of a solution is part of the point: life\u2019s uncertainty...the true suspense resides not in the mystery of the photographic blow-ups, but in the instability of Thomas himself.\"<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 99:</ref>}}\n\nIn an interview at the time of the film's release, Antonioni stated that the film \"is not about man's relationship with man, it is about man's relationship with reality\".<ref name=\"thrills\" /> Indeed, Gow observes that \u201ca mystery without a solution is instrumental to the theme of disorientation in Antonioni\u2019s ''Blowup.''<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 98:</ref>\n\nThe theme of uncertainty is sustained until the final moments of the ''Blowup'', when Thomas attempts to resolve the contradictions and ambiguities that arise from his investigations and from his own life, but fails to integrate them.<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 100: Thomas fails to \u201credress the [im]balance\u201d And: p. 104: Thomas fails to \u201cmaintain equilibrium\u201d between his \u201ccreative world\u201d and the \u201culcerated area of materialism and fact.</ref>\n\nIn ''Blowup''\u2019s final sequence, a \u201cgarishly attired\u201d mime troupe arrives at the park\u2014escapees from the real world. Thomas joins them in their fantasy play, and like the non-existent ball he \u201csees\u201d during the troupes\u2019 faux match, he dissolves from view: \u201cAs a creature of the factual world, he no longer exists.\u201d<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 103-104:</ref>\n\nWhen ''Blowup''\u2019s denouement is reached Thomas\u2019 fate is known and the audience's suspense is resolved, but Antonioni leaves the meaning of the film open to speculation.<ref>Gow, 1968 p. 104: \u201c...as in the case of many films of depth...interpretation rests with the spectator\u2026\u201d</ref>\nGordon Gow considers alternate interpretations for the film's ending:\n\n{{blockquote|\u201cSince ''Blowup'' is not resolved happily, but rather in a total surrender to fantasy and consequently to oblivion, we can take it either as an exhortation to come to terms with reality, or as a cautionary tale in which the pursuit of material gain is a threat to humanity.\u201d <ref>Gow, 1968 p. 104</ref>}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| [[Academy Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[39th Academy Awards|10 April 1967]]\n| [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n| [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1967 |title=THE 39TH ACADEMY AWARDS |date=2015 |access-date=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]\n| Michelangelo Antonioni, [[Tonino Guerra]] and [[Edward Bond]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| [[British Academy Film Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[21st British Academy Film Awards|1968]]\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]]\n| Michelangelo Antonioni\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1968/film?

In an interview [[Sterling Morrison]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] claimed that Antonioni had also asked the Velvet Underground to appear in the film, and the band were \"more than willing\", but due to the expense of flying the Velvets over from the US, Antonioni instead decided on an English group.<ref>Bockris, Victor; Malanga, Gerard (2009) [1983].
