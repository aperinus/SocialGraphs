A remake of the [[We're No Angels (1955 film)|1955 film of the same name]], the film stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Demi Moore]]. It received mixed reviews and grossed $10.5 million on a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA couple of 1930s [[Great Depression]]-era convicts, Ned and Jim, jailed on never-specified charges and abused by a ruthless warden, are dragged along when a vicious killer named Bobby escapes the electric chair.\n\nThe two end up in a small [[upstate New York]] town near the Canada\u2013US border, where they are mistaken for a pair of priests expected at the local monastery. They want to flee but cannot, since misunderstandings and the warden's search party looking for Bobby make a trip across the bridge to Canada almost impossible.\n\nNed and Jim continue to masquerade as priests, trusted and welcomed by Father Levesque. An opportunity presents itself in the form of a procession to the church's sister church across the border. Each priest participating has to bring along someone who needs help, so they decide on the deaf-mute daughter of Molly, a local laundress and prostitute.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Were-No-Angels/dp/B0018R8IKI Amazon.com]</ref>\n\nBobby is killed by police during the procession. Ned saves Molly's daughter from drowning, after this event she is able to speak. Jim is befriended by a young monk and decides to stay in the monastery to actually become a priest. Ned takes Molly and her daughter to Canada.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Ned\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Jim\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Molly\n* [[Hoyt Axton]] as Father Levesque\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Deputy\n* [[Ray McAnally]] as Warden\n* [[James Russo]] as Bobby\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Translator\n* [[John C.
