The screenplay is written by Damon and Krasinski based on a story by [[Dave Eggers]]. ''Promised Land'' follows two petroleum landmen who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy [[drilling rights]] from the local residents.\n\nDamon was originally attached to direct the film, but he was replaced by Van Sant. Filming took place mainly in [[Pittsburgh]] from early to mid-2012. During filming and afterward, the film's highlighting of the resource extraction process [[hydraulic fracturing]], known as \"fracking,\" emerged as a topic of debate.\n\nThe film had a limited release in the United States on {{nowrap|December 28}}, 2012 and followed with a nationwide expansion on {{nowrap|January 4}}, 2013. The film had its international premiere and received Special Mention Award at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013. It received mixed reviews from critics, although the [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2012#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2012]], and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $8 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Butler has caught the eyes of top management at his employer, Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that specializes in obtaining natural gas trapped underground through a process known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Butler has an excellent track record for quickly and cheaply persuading land owners to sign mineral rights leases that grant drilling rights over to his employer. Butler and his partner Sue Thomason arrive in an economically struggling Pennsylvania farming town whose citizens are proud of having family farms passed from one generation to the next.\n\nComing from a town and a life very similar to that of the people he is now determined to win over on behalf of Global, Butler tells the story of how his own town died after the local [[Caterpillar, Inc.|Caterpillar]] assembly plant closed. The idea of a town surviving solely on family farms being passed down through generations as a viable economy is one that he can no longer accept. He claims to be offering the town its last chance. Butler spends some pleasant after-hours time with Alice, a teacher he meets in a bar.\n\nThe community seems willing to accept Global's offer, until an elderly, local high school science teacher, Frank Yates, who happened to be a successful engineer in his working life, raises the question of the safety of fracking during a town meeting. It's decided that the people will vote in a few weeks whether or not to take the offer. After hearing about the vote, Dustin Noble, an unknown environmental advocate, starts a grassroots campaign against Global, motivated by a tale of his family losing its Nebraska dairy farm after the herd died as a result of Global's industry-standard fracking process.\n\nButler begins to meet a great deal of resistance in town. Noble seems to be winning over nearly everyone, including Alice. One night Butler receives a package from Global that includes an enlarged copy of a photograph of dead cattle on a field that Noble said came from his family's Nebraska farm. The enlargement shows that an object thought to be a silo is, in fact, a lighthouse, which are nonexistent in Nebraska, revealing that Noble fabricated his story and deceived the people. The picture was actually taken in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], where Global is in the midst of a lawsuit over environmental complications that were probably caused by their fracking practices.\n\nButler informs the town's mayor of the deception, who then informs the rest of the town. He returns to the hotel to find Noble loading his truck, preparing to leave town. Noble accidentally reveals that he knows the picture with the lighthouse was taken in Lafayette. Butler realizes the only way Noble could have known this information is if he were also employed by Global, and that Noble's job had been to discredit the environmental movement and convince the town to vote in favor of Global's offer. He arranged for Butler to receive the \"confidential\" photos and engineered the entire public relations effort.\n\nAt a town meeting the next day, the citizens are prepared to vote on Global's efforts to buy drilling rights to their property. Butler talks to them about how the barn in the picture reminds him of his grandfather's barn. He reveals that Noble has manipulated them and is employed by Global. Butler leaves the meeting to find Thomason on the phone with Global. She tells him he's fired and that she is leaving for New York. Butler walks to Alice's home and she welcomes him in.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Steve Butler\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Dustin Noble\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Sue Thomason\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Alice\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jeff Dennon\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as Rob\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as David Churchill\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Drew Scott\n* [[Lucas Black]] as Paul Geary\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Frank Yates\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Promised Land'' is directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Damon]] and [[John Krasinski]], who are film producers along with [[Chris Moore (film producer)|Chris Moore]].
