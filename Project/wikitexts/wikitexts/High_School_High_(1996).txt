It is a [[Parody|spoof]] of movies concerning idealistic teachers<sup>(see e.g. ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'')</sup> being confronted with a class of cynical teenagers, disengaged by conventional schooling, and loosely parodies ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'', ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'', ''[[The Principal]]'', ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'', ''[[Lean on Me (film)|Lean on Me]]'', ''[[The Substitute]]'', ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', and  ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''. The film is dedicated to the memories of casting director Elisabeth Leustig and actor Lexie Bigham, both of whom were killed in automobile crashes shortly after filming was completed.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRichard Clark is an unsatisfied prep school teacher at the fictional Wellington Academy, who accepts a job at inner city [[Marion Barry]] High School, much to the chagrin of his boss and father, Wellington headmaster Thaddeus Clark. Richard arrives to find the school in a state of disarray and disorder, while meeting several students and faculty members including: the blunted, soured, and uninspiring principal, Evelyn Doyle, her cheerful assistant Victoria Chappell and student Griff McReynolds.\n\nDespite initial opposition to his teaching style and harassment from the school gang leader Paco, Richard begins connecting with his students and teaches them effectively, while developing a romantic relationship with Victoria. Barry High eventually is transformed into a fine educational establishment. Frustrated, Paco and his gang tamper with the school's final exam scores, causing everyone to fail. Griff, who grew to see Richard as a mentor, loses faith in him, as does the rest of the school and Richard is fired. Griff subsequently joins Paco's gang to make extra money.\n\nVictoria learns through word of mouth that Paco was behind the failing test scores and rushes to inform Richard, who decides to confront Paco and rescue Griff with the help of several of his students, including Anferny Jefferson, Natalie Thompson and Julie Rubels. By deceiving Mr. DeMarco, a local gangster, Richard and Victoria reach Paco and the local crime boss, \"Mr. A\", whom they find has been Principal Doyle the entire time. Griff is told the truth about the test scores and after a brief fight, Paco, Doyle and DeMarco are arrested.\n\nRichard (now principal of Barry High) presides over the graduation ceremony and proudly names Griff as the class valedictorian. The six main students of the film graduate (but only those six). Richard makes good on his promise to send Griff to college and is in a relationship with Victoria.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Richard Clark, a naive, mild-mannered white teacher whose main goal is to help the underachieving students at Marion Barry High School succeed.\n** Lovitz also plays his own mother.\n* [[Tia Carrere]] as Victoria Chappell, the principal's assistant who sympathizes with Richard, as well as with the troubled students at Marion Barry High.\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Principal Evelyn Doyle, a mean-spirited, uncaring principal who doesn't believe in the academic abilities of a single student at her school and has given up on them.
