The film stars [[Ricardo Cortez]] as private detective [[Sam Spade]] and [[Bebe Daniels]] as Ruth Wonderly. Maude Fulton, Brown Holmes, and [[Lucien Hubbard]] (who went uncredited) wrote the screenplay.<ref name=tcmnotes/> The supporting cast features [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]], [[Una Merkel]], and [[Dwight Frye]].<ref name=\"The Maltese Falcon 1931\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1764/The-Maltese-Falcon/full-credits.html|title=The Maltese Falcon (1931)|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film was successful, its legacy was deeply hampered by the enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays code]]. The film was remade by the studio twice, with [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|its 1941 remake]] starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Mary Astor]] overshadowing its predecessors. The film was not seen in its entirety until after the collapse of the Code in the mid-1960s. A print has been held by the Library of Congress since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress |page=110 |year=1978 |publisher=The American Film Institute }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words. -->\nIn San Francisco, private investigator Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are hired by Ruth Wonderly to follow Floyd Thursby, a man that allegedly ran off with her younger sister. Later that night, police detective Tom Polhaus informs Spade that Archer has been killed while tailing Thursby. Thursby is killed later, and the police suspect Spade.\n\nThe next day, Spade calls on Ruth Wonderly in an attempt to find out her real reasons for hiring them. She gives Spade little information, but manages to keep him on the case. Later, Dr. Joel Cairo visits his office and offers him $5,000 if he can retrieve an enamel figurine of a black bird. Cairo is trying to recover it for the \"rightful owner\". Not knowing anything about the statuette, Spade plays along and agrees to try to recover it.\n\nThat night, at his apartment, Spade tells Wonderly about his talk with Cairo, and she becomes nervous. Then Polhaus and his superior Lt. Dundy arrive. They question Spade, but are interrupted by the screams of Wonderly, who is holding Cairo at gunpoint after he has broken in. The policemen leave with Cairo in tow. The next morning, as Wonderly sleeps in his bed, Spade lifts her key and thoroughly searches her apartment, finding nothing.\n\nReturning to his own place, Spade receives a note from Casper Gutman, inviting him to come and talk about the black bird. Over drinks and cigars, Spade learns the history and value of the statuette, which is encrusted with precious jewels. Gutman is the mastermind behind the attempt to steal it. Believing Spade has it, Gutman reveals everything he knows. Just then, Cairo arrives and tells Gutman privately that Spade does not have the falcon, as it is on a ship that arrives from Hong Kong that night. Gutman slips Spade a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|mickey]] in a celebratory drink, and leaves.\n\nLater that night, Spade arrives back in his office and finds Effie asleep behind his desk. Suddenly, a man staggers in and dies{{snd}}it is Captain Jacoby of the bird's ship, having been shot several times. The suitcase he was carrying has the precious black bird in it. Spade checks the bag at a baggage check and sends himself the ticket in the mail. Called in to see the District Attorney because of Archer's murder, Spade is given 24 hours to wrap up the case and identify the real killers.\n\nWonderly lures Spade into his apartment, where Cairo and Gutman are waiting with guns. Gutman offers him an envelope with $10,000 in exchange for the falcon. Spade insists there also has to be a \"[[fall guy]]\" that will go to jail for the murders and suggests Gutman's gunman, Wilmer Cook. Gutman and Cairo agree to Spade's proposal. Spade calls Effie and asks her to bring the suitcase to them in the morning, while Gutman explains how Wilmer killed Thursby and Jacoby.\n\nThe bag shows up, and Wilmer escapes while the conspirators are frantically opening it and examining the bird. They soon determine that it is a fake{{snd}}they have been duped by the previous owner{{snd}}and Gutman and Cairo decide to make another attempt to steal it. As they leave, Gutman takes back his $10,000 from Spade at gunpoint. Spade immediately calls Detective Polhaus and tells him to pick up Gutman, Cairo and Wilmer. Confronting Wonderly, Spade accuses her of killing Archer to frame Thursby and get him out of the way. She admits it, and Spade tells her that he is going to turn her in, despite their love for each other.\n\nWhen Dundy and Polhaus show up, they reveal that Wilmer killed Gutman and Cairo before being apprehended. Spade gives them Wilmer's guns, tells them that Wonderly killed Archer, and they take her away. Spade goes to visit Wonderly in prison to tell her that he has been made Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's office. Spade instructs the prison matron to treat Wonderly well and give her whatever she wants. When the matron asks who will pay for the special treatment, Spade tells her to send the bill to the D.A.'s office: \"I'll OK it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Maltese Falcon 1931 title.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title Card for the film.]]\n* [[Bebe Daniels]] as Ruth Wonderly\n* [[Ricardo Cortez]] as [[Sam Spade]]\n* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Casper Gutman\n* [[Una Merkel]] as Effie Perine\n* [[Robert Elliott (actor)|Robert Elliott]] as Detective Lieutenant Dundy\n* [[Thelma Todd]] as Iva Archer\n* [[Otto Matieson]] as Dr. Joel Cairo\n* [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]] as Miles Archer\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as Wilmer Cook\n* [[J.

John Jacobi (uncredited)\n* [[Morgan Wallace]] as District Attorney (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n''The Maltese Falcon'' was not the first Hammett story to be adapted into a motion picture.  Earlier stories by Hammett, ''[[Red Harvest]]'' (filmed in 1930 as ''[[Roadhouse Nights]]'') and ''[[City Streets (1931 film)|City Streets]]'' (1931), preceded it.<ref name=tcmarticle>{{citation | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1764/The-Maltese-Falcon/articles.html | first = Frank | last = Miller | title = Articles: The Maltese Falcon (1931) | work = TCM | publisher = Turner Classic Movies, Inc. | access-date = April 15, 2018}}</ref> Working titles for the film were ''All Women'', ''A Woman of the World'' and ''Dangerous Female''.\n\nPrincipal photography took place from late January to early February 1931.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> \nSome scenes in the film were reported to be shot on location in San Francisco, though only stock footage appears to have been used.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=tcmnotes />\n\n[[Oscar Apfel]] was initially cast and listed in some studio promotions as the district attorney; however, for unknown reasons, he was replaced by Wallace.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\n===Pre-Code aspects===\nThe film closely follows the plot of the book. The [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|1941 adaptation]], which began with a revised version of the 1931 script, closely follows the book as well, although most references to homosexuality, nudity, and other no longer permissible portions under the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] are missing. The dialogue for both films is often taken verbatim directly from the novel. Differences between the two films are due almost wholly to pre-Code aspects of the earlier film.\n\nIn addition to an overall lighter tone and looser pace, the 1931 film contains sexually suggestive situations. In the opening scene, an unidentified woman is shown straightening her stockings as she leaves Spade's office. Miss Wonderly ([[Bebe Daniels]]) is shown bathing, and later in the film is strip-searched by Spade over missing money. The homosexual subtext regarding Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer in Hammett's original story was retained for the 1931 film. Wilmer is called Gutman's \"boyfriend\", Effie facetiously describes Cairo to Spade as \"gorgeous\", and Spade taunts Dundy by constantly referring to him as \"sweetheart\", \"darling\", and \"precious\". All of those terms were severely limited or eliminated entirely for the 1941 remake.<ref name=tcmnotes/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metafilter.com/84628/The-Maltese-Falcon-Take-1 | title = The Maltese Falcon: Take 1 | date = August 31, 2009 | first = Kirk | last = Franklin | work = MetaFilter | publisher = MetaFilter Network Inc. | access-date = September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Remakes==\nIn 1935, Warner Bros. attempted to re-release the film, but were denied approval by the [[Production Code]] Office owing to the film's \"lewd\" content. This prompted Warner Bros. to produce a new version of the film, ''[[Satan Met a Lady]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Warren William]] directed by [[William Dieterle]] in 1936.<ref name=\"Satan Met a Lady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/937/Satan-Met-a-Lady/full-credits.html|title=Satan Met a Lady (1936): Full Credits  |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> Many elements of the story were changed, and the film was given a comedic tone. Ultimately, the film was widely panned; Davis herself referred to the film as \"junk\".\n\nIn 1941, Warner Bros. [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|remade the film more faithfully]] in an adaption directed by [[John Huston]] in his directorial debut. The film, starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Mary Astor]], was released to critical acclaim and is often cited as one of the best films of all time.<ref name=\"The Maltese Falcon 1941\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2805/The-Maltese-Falcon/full-credits.html|title=The Maltese Falcon (1941): Full Credits |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>  This version was also filmed largely verbatim to Hammett's story, but removed references to nudity, homosexuality, and other topics forbidden by the Code. It also had a much more dramatic, darker tone, which many cite as [[film noir]].\n\nFor several decades, unedited copies of the 1931 film could not be seen in the United States; these restrictions were lifted following the demise of the Motion Picture Production Code in the mid-1960s. For television airings in the United States, the film was retitled ''Dangerous Female'' to avoid confusion with the 1941 remake.\n\n==Reviews==\n* ''[[Photoplay]]'', June 1931, p.&nbsp;57.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|id=5690|title=The Maltese Falcon}}\n* {{IMDb title|0022111|The Maltese Falcon}}\n* {{tcmdb title|1764|The Maltese Falcon}}\n* {{Amg movie|31036|The Maltese Falcon}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1063050-maltese_falcon|The Maltese Falcon}}\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Dashiell Hammett}}\n{{Roy Del Ruth}}\n{{The Maltese Falcon}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maltese Falcon (1931 film), The}}\n[[Category:1931 films]]\n[[Category:1930s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1930s LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1930s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American detective films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roy Del Ruth]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Dashiell Hammett]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
