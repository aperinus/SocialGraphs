Aladdin and Abu have settled in the palace of Agrabah with Princess Jasmine and her father, the Sultan. Still yearning for adventures, Aladdin foils a criminal group led by the dimwitted Abis Mal and returns their stolen loot to the people of Agrabah. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago escapes from Jafar's lamp. Tired of being taken for granted, Iago refuses Jafar's demands to free him. After dropping the lamp into a well, Iago returns to Agrabah, hoping to befriend Aladdin and return to the palace. During a confrontation with Aladdin and Abu, the three are attacked by Abis Mal and his henchmen; Iago inadvertently saves Aladdin's life. In gratitude, Aladdin keeps Iago on the palace grounds, promising to speak with the Sultan on Iago's behalf.\n\nMeanwhile, Abis Mal finds Jafar's lamp in the well. Hindered by his incompetent new master, Jafar manipulates Abis Mal into wasting his first two wishes, then enlists his help in taking revenge on Aladdin. In exchange he will grant him a special third wish. Abis Mal agrees, also desiring revenge on Aladdin. Meanwhile, the Genie returns to the palace after traveling the world for one year, though his powers are diminished now that he is free from the lamp. At the evening banquet, the Sultan announces Aladdin as the new Royal Vizier. Abu and Rajah discover Iago in the garden and chase him into the banquet. Aladdin asks the Sultan to pardon Iago, but Jasmine is dismayed that Aladdin never confided in her. The Sultan remains suspicious, however, but issues Iago a temporary [[pardon]], with the stipulation that Aladdin watch over him. Genie and Iago help persuade Jasmine to forgive Aladdin for keeping Iago a secret and agrees to give Iago a chance. However, Jafar sneaks into the palace and forces Iago to trick Aladdin and the Sultan to travel to a waterfall.\n\nDuring the trip, the Sultan eventually forgives Aladdin, but Jafar ambushes them, sending Aladdin into the waterfall and capturing the Sultan, with Jasmine, Genie and Abu also caught and locked in the dungeon. Aladdin eventually makes his way back to Agrabah to warn Razoul, but Jafar, posing as Jasmine, frames Aladdin for the Sultan's alleged murder and sentences him to execution. Feeling guilty for his betrayal, Iago frees the Genie, who saves Aladdin. Jafar now controls Agrabah, but Aladdin vows to stop him and Genie reveals Jafar can be killed by destroying his lamp. Iago decides to leave, but not before Aladdin thanks him.\n\nAladdin and the group confront Jafar in the treasure room just before Abis Mal can wish him free. However, Jafar knocks both Aladdin and Abis Mal out the tower and sends them hurtling through the Palace trees; and Abis Mal drops Jafar's lamp. Aladdin frees himself, and the group attempts to get the lamp, but Jafar transforms into his Genie form, incapacitates the Genie, and shatters the Carpet. He splits open the Palace gardens, creating a pool of [[lava]] and traps Aladdin on a sinking rock. Iago, who has once again had a change of heart, returns and grabs the lamp, but is knocked out by Jafar. Though [[Burn|injured]], he kicks the lamp into the lava, and Aladdin rescues Iago as Jafar's magic is undone, making Jafar self-destroy and restoring the Palace gardens and the Carpet. Everyone forgives Iago and he is officially accepted into the palace. Aladdin ultimately rejects the Sultan's offer to become the Vizier, instead opting to [[Aladdin (animated TV series)|see the world]] with Jasmine, much to Iago's chagrin.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Abis Mal, still dangling from the tree, realizes he'll never get his third wish.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as [[Iago (Disney)|Iago]]\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Abis Mal|Abis Mal]]\n* [[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]] as [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]]\n* [[Scott Weinger]] as [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]]\n* [[Brad Kane]] as Aladdin (singing voice)\n* [[Linda Larkin]] as [[Jasmine (Disney character)|Princess Jasmine]]\n* [[Liz Callaway]] as Princess Jasmine (singing voice)\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Abu|Abu]] and [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Rajah|Rajah]]\n* [[Val Bettin]] as the [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#The Sultan|Sultan]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Razoul]]\n\nAdditional voices are provided by [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Jim Cummings]], [[B.

And despite the fact that he was freed from his lamp at the end of the first film, the genie (now voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is back and wackier than ever. It's clear right from the outset that Disney put very little effort into the production of ''The Return of Jafar'', particularly in the realm of animation. The film has all the style and fluidity of a Saturday morning cartoon, while various songs are bland and forgettable. The repetitive storyline doesn't do the movie any favors, and even at a running time of 69-minutes, doldrums set in almost immediately. Castellaneta does the best he can with the material, but generally comes up short (particularly when compared with Robin Williams's manic performance from the original). ''The Return of Jafar'' is a thoroughly needless sequel that may keep small children engaged, but is bound to come off as nothing less than a huge disappointment for fans of the original.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reelfilm.com/aladdin.htm|title=The Aladdin Trilogy - Reviews by David Nusair|website=www.reelfilm.com}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite the mostly negative reception, on the television program ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'', the film received a \"two thumbs up\" from [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]].<ref>{{cite episode|first=Roger (host)|last=Ebert|first2=Gene (host)|last2=Siskel|url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=5396 |title=Maverick, Trading Mom, The Return of Jafar, Widow\u2019s Peak, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues|series=Siskel & Ebert|season=8|number=37|date=May 21, 1994|access-date=August 22, 2020|via=SiskelEbert.org}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Steve Daly graded the sequel a C\u2212 criticizing it as a \"knockoff\" that \"carries the Disney label and costs about as much as a tape of ''Aladdin'', but it's clear from the first jerky frame that the same time, care, and creativity didn't go into it.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302275,00.html |title=The Return of Jafar Review |last=Daly |first=Steve |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 20, 1994 |access-date=August 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Comic===\nWhen Disney was publishing their own comics in the mid-90s, they produced a two-issue ''Aladdin'' comic presenting an alternate version of ''The Return of Jafar''. It was titled ''The Return of Aladdin''. The comic is introduced by the Merchant from the first film.\n\nThe story starts off showing that Aladdin has been particularly bored of palace life. Meanwhile, Jafar has escaped the Cave of Wonders. Iago is given the task of finding the right master for Jafar to manipulate. Their search seems hopeless as some people are able to enjoy all three wishes or messing up. They find someone to use the lamp, who is known as Isabella, a master magician. Isabella is similar in appearance to Jafar (except his clothing is green). His first wish is to return to Agrabah Palace (as he performed entertainment to the sultan in #1). His second wish is for an army of soldiers to pursue Aladdin and Jasmine when they catch on to Jafar's presence. He is persuaded to use his third wish to trap Jafar and Iago in the lamp again, sending them back to the cave. Due to persuasion by the Genie, the Sultan hires Isabella to a permanent entertainment job at the palace. The end of the story shows the merchant having a black lamp similar to Jafar's, but he claims it to be worthless.\n\n===Video game===\nThe plot of the film is loosely used in Agrabah, one of the worlds in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', and the Peddler appears from the first film. As in the film, Iago escapes from Jafar and does his best to respect Aladdin, Jasmine, Sora, Donald and Goofy, although Jafar coerces him into aiding him in his revenge, almost damaging Iago's friendship with Aladdin and Sora, but he redeems himself after taking a blow for Aladdin which almost claims his life. The Peddler, at the beginning, comes across Jafar's lamp, but sells it to Aladdin, Sora, Donald and Goofy for a rare artifact in the Cave of Wonders. Despite Aladdin sealing the lamp in the palace dungeon, the greedy Peddler breaks into the dungeon and frees Jafar, unleashing his fury on Agrabah until he is defeated by Sora and company. The Peddler's fate is left ambiguous. This was the first Disney sequel to have its plot adapted into a level in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, which was then followed by the Grid being an adaptation of ''[[Tron Legacy]]'', and the Caribbean being one of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.\n\nFurthermore, there is a mild allusion to the Agrabah boss battle in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Sora must fight Jafar in Genie form, surrounded by a lava pit with raising and lowering levels, while Iago flies above with Jafar's lamp. Only striking the lamp has any effect on Jafar's health. This fight also takes place in the second game, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', and its PlayStation 2 remake. In both versions of ''Chain of Memories'', the boss fight is due to the majority of the game being illusions created from Sora's memories. A second playable character, Riku, also fights the boss in his mode. The battle is once again visited in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Re:coded]]''.\n\n==Follow-ups==\nThe film was followed by a television series titled ''[[Aladdin (animated TV series)|Aladdin]]'', which served as the overall third installment, and another direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'', which was released in 1996. The franchise was later re-visited in \"[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]\", a crossover episode with ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'', and in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Disney|Film|United States|Animation|1990s}}\n*{{wikiquote-inline}}\n*{{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/aladdin-the-return-of-jafar}}\n*{{amg movie|121846}}\n*{{bcdb title|7273}}\n*{{IMDb title|0107952}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|return_of_jafar}}\n\n{{Aladdin and the Magic Lamp}}\n{{One Thousand and One Nights}}\n{{Disney's Aladdin}}\n{{Disney direct-to-video animated features}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Return Of Jafar, The}}\n[[Category:Aladdin (franchise)]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 animated films]]\n[[Category:1994 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1994 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1990s musical films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated musical films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American television series premieres]]\n[[Category:Animated films about magic]]\n[[Category:Australian animated feature films]]\n[[Category:Australian sequel films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:Disney direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:DisneyToon Studios animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Aladdin]]\n[[Category:Genies in film]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Disney Television Animation films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Duane Capizzi]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Watters]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Films set in palaces]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tad Stones]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated films]]\n[[Category:Japanese sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Middle Ages]]"}]}}}}
