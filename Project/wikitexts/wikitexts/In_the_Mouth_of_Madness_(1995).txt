It stars [[Sam Neill]], [[Julie Carmen]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Charlton Heston]]. Neill stars as John Trent, an [[insurance investigator]] who visits a small town while looking into the disappearance of a successful author of [[horror novel]]s, and begins to question his sanity as the lines between reality and fiction seem to blur. Informally, the film is the third installment in what Carpenter refers to as his \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", preceded by ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/2/3279482/the-classics-john-carpenter-apocalypse-trilogy|title=The Classics: John Carpenter's 'Apocalypse Trilogy'|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|date=2012-09-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n''In the Mouth of Madness'' pays tribute to the works of author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] in its exploration of [[insanity]], and its title is derived from the Lovecraft novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''. Distributed by [[New Line Cinema]], ''In the Mouth of Madness'' received mixed reviews upon release, but has since garnered a [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn the midst of an unspecified disaster, Dr. Wrenn visits John Trent, a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and Trent recounts his story:\n\nTrent, a freelance [[insurance investigator]], has lunch with the owner of an insurance company, who asks Trent to work with his largest client investigating a claim by [[New York City|New York]]-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man with mutated eyes wielding an axe who, after asking him if he reads popular horror novelist Sutter Cane, is shot dead by police. The man was Cane's agent, who went insane and killed his family after reading one of Cane's books.\n\nTrent meets with Arcane director Jackson Harglow, who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of Cane and recovering the manuscript for his final novel. He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles, to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in \"less stable readers.\" Trent is skeptical, convinced the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on the covers of Cane's books, which, when aligned properly, form the outline of [[New Hampshire]] and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.\n\nLinda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.\n\nLinda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, ''In the Mouth of Madness,'' which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing a mutated Cane. A man who had previously attempted to stop Cane's insidious agenda approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon Trent. Trent drives away, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings called [[Cthulhu Mythos deities#Great Old Ones|\"The Old Ones\"]] which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of ''In the Mouth of Madness'' to Arcane, furthering the end of humanity.\n\nAfter giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears a giant photograph of his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' has been on sale for weeks, with a [[Novel adaptation|film adaptation]] in [[post production]]. Trent then encounters a reader of the newly released novel, who is bleeding from his altered eyes; Trent murders him with an axe. Trent is then arrested for murder and sent to the asylum.\n\nAfter Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned, and he departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent then goes to see the ''In the Mouth of Madness'' film where he discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen - including a scene where he insisted to Linda \"This is reality!\" - Trent begins laughing hysterically. \n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

P. Lovecraft]], with many references to his stories and themes. Its title is a play on Lovecraft's novella, ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]],'' and [[insanity]] plays as great a role in the film as it does in Lovecraft's fiction. The opening scene depicts Trent's confinement in an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]], with the bulk of the story told in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], a common technique of Lovecraft. Reference is made to Lovecraftian settings and details (such as a character who shares the name of Lovecraft's [[Pickman's Model|Pickman]] family). Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories: ''The Whisperer of the Dark'' (''The Whisperer in Darkness''), ''The Thing in the Basement'' (''The Thing on the Doorstep''), ''Haunter out of Time'' (''The Haunter of the Dark''/''The Shadow Out of Time''), and ''The Hobbs End Horror'' (''The Dunwich Horror''), the latter also referencing Hobbs End underground station from [[Nigel Kneale]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]].'' \nThe Cane novels are, in no particular order: \"The Thing in the Basement\", \"The Breathing Tunnel\", \"Haunted Out of Time\", \"The Feeding\", \"The Whisperer in the Dark\", \"The Hobb's End Horror\", and \"In the Mouth of Madness\".\n\nThe film also can be seen as referencing [[Stephen King]], who, like Lovecraft, writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets. In fact, the characters even directly compare King (unfavorably) to Sutter Cane within the film itself.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121217130116/https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-12-17 | title=Deseret News: In the Mouth of Madness Review | author=Chris Hicks | date=1995-02-07 | access-date=2010-01-03 | publisher=Deseret News }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213236/http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nLinda Styles tells Trent early in the film, \"You can forget about Stephen King, Cane outsells them all!\"\n\nThe film's main theme, heard during the opening credits, was inspired by the [[Metallica]] song \"[[Enter Sandman]]\".

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a mixed two-out-of-four stars, complimenting Neill's acting and Carpenter's work as a director, but ultimately said the film fell flat due to its screenplay, saying \"...one wonders how ''In the Mouth of Madness'' might have turned out if the script had contained even just a little more wit and ambition.\" [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film the same rating, as did [[James Berardinelli]], who said the film \"comes close to doing something interesting but gets cold feet\" and is \"confusing, weird, and not very involving,\" comparing the film to buying an exotic sports car only to drive it slowly. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+ rating. In more negative reviews, Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film was \"cheesy horror celebrating the power of cheesy horror, while pretending to be appalled,\" and gave the film a one-out-of-four-star rating.
