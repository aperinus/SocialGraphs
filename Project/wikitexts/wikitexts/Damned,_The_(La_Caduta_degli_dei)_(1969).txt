All versions, however, use ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'' as a subtitle.}} is a 1969 [[historical drama film]] directed by [[Luchino Visconti]], co-written by Visconti with [[Nicola Badalucco]] and [[Enrico Medioli]], and starring [[Helmut Berger]], [[Dirk Bogarde]], [[Ingrid Thulin]], [[Helmut Griem]], [[Umberto Orsini]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Florinda Bolkan]], and [[Albrecht Schoenhals|Albrecht Sch\u00f6nhals]] in his final film. Set in 1930s Germany, the film centers on the Essenbecks, a wealthy industrialist family who have begun doing business with the [[Nazi Party]], and whose amoral and unstable heir, Martin, is embroiled in his family's machinations. It is loosely based on the [[Krupp]] family of steel industrialists from [[Essen]], Germany.\n\nPrincipal photography of ''The Damned'' took place in locations throughout Italy and West Germany, including Rome's [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]]. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, but also faced controversy from ratings boards for its sexual content, including depictions of [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[rape]], and [[incest]]. In the United States, the film was given an [[X rating]] by the [[MPAA]] and was only lowered to a more-marketable [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R]] after twelve minutes of offending footage were cut.\n\nVisconti won the [[Nastro d'Argento for Best Director]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay Oscar]] with co-writers [[Nicola Badalucco]] and [[Enrico Medioli]]. Helmut Berger received a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actor|Most Promising Newcomer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1930s Germany, the Essenbecks are a wealthy and powerful industrialist family who have begun doing business with the newly elected [[Nazi Party]]. On the night of the [[Reichstag fire]] in early 1933, the family's [[Conservatism in Germany|conservative]] patriarch, Baron Joachim von Essenbeck, who represents the old [[German nobility|aristocratic]] Germany and detests [[Adolf Hitler]], is celebrating his birthday. The celebration features the family's children performing for the Baron, his family and guests on a makeshift stage. While grandnephew G\u00fcnther performs a piece of music on his cello, grandson Martin performs a [[Drag (clothing)|drag performance]] that is interrupted by news that the Reichstag has been burned.\n\nMartin's possessive mother (and Joachim's widowed daughter-in-law), Sophie, has been secretly carrying on a longstanding affair with Friedrich Bruckmann, an executive of the family's steelworks. Her father-in-law tacitly demands that Sophie never remarry and both fear that if their relationship were to be exposed, Sophie would be disowned and Friedrich fired. Friedrich is friendly with a cousin of Sophie's dead husband; a [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leader named Aschenbach,{{efn|The character of Aschnebach's SS rank is [[anachronistic]], as the \"Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer\" rank did not exist until late 1934, after the film's events, when it replaced the equivalent rank of [[Sturmhauptfuhrer]].}} Aschenbach is aware that Friedrich seeks the title of Baron; he is also aware that the Baron has split control over the company in his will: his unscrupulous nephew, the boorish [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] officer Konstantin, will inherit the company but Martin will inherit enough shares of stock to give him ''de facto'' control over the direction the company takes.\n\nActing on Aschenbach's previous statements that things would be better if the anti-Nazi Joachim was to die, Friederich kills Joachim and frames the outspoken Herbert Thalmann for the crime by using his personal handgun secured by Sophie. Herbert narrowly escapes abroad, but in his haste is forced to leave behind his wife and children. When his wife, Elizabeth, visits Sophie for help clearing her husband's name, Sophie denounces her by telling her that the Germany of old is dead. Sophie seemingly makes arrangements for Elizabeth and her daughters to join Herbert in exile and they are depicted reaching a train station, but it is later revealed that they are actually arrested and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], characterized in the film as an internment camp.\n\nAschenbach convinces Friedrich and Martin to embargo their company from selling weapons to the SA, as the SS is seeking to marginalize the rival group in order to pacify the [[Reichswehr]]'s generals to Hitler's side. Konstantin discovers that Martin has been [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] his nieces, as well as Lisa Keller, a poor [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] girl, who eventually commits [[suicide]] after Martin assaults her one night before visiting his girlfriend. Armed with this information, Konstantin [[blackmail]]s Martin to resume providing the SA guns and ammunition and sends a letter detailing his crimes to Sophie so that she will get Friedrich to help provide cover for Martin in defying the SS. Hiding in the family's attic, Martin is confronted by Sophie, who agrees to help free Martin from Konstantin's blackmail. Sophie meets up with Aschenbach, who reveals that Hitler is planning on purging the SA and offers to destroy the Konstantin's blackmail dossier for a future favor. In 1934, the SA\u2014Konstantin among them\u2014have a meeting at a hotel in [[Bad Wiessee]] to discuss their dissatisfaction with Hitler. The evening is depicted as a drunken celebration, ending with the male SA officers engaging in [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with one another. At dawn, [[Night of the Long Knives|the hotel is stormed by SS troops who slaughter various SA members]]. Konstantin is personally executed by Friedrich, who Aschenbach brought along with him during the slaughter to ensure Konstantin's death.\n\nFriedrich is now in charge of the family business, but Aschenbach is confronted by Sophie who demands that her father's last name and royal title of Baron be assigned to Friedrich so they can marry as equals. Aschenbach refuses and reminds Sophie that the Nazis want control over the steel and munitions business and will take it by force if the couple won't become willing servants to the Nazi Party. Meanwhile, Martin becomes furious as he realizes that the last remaining barriers keeping his mother from remarrying are gone and that Friedrich intends to take control over the family business for himself. Aschenbach offers Martin the destruction of his mother and her lover, after Martin confesses his hatred for them to Aschenbach.\n\nDuring a family dinner, Friedrich and Aschenbach start arguing after Friedrich announces that Aschenbach, G\u00fcnther, and Martin must submit themselves to the will and whims of the new head of the family. Aschenbach denounces Friedrich as a weak [[social climber]] and disloyal Nazi, as he brings a returning Herbert to the chamber. Herbert reveals that after Sophie arranged their arrest, Elizabeth and their children were sent to Dachau concentration camp, where Elizabeth died. Aschenbach has offered to free Herbert's children in exchange for Herbert's false confession to Joachim's death; though it's left ambiguous whether or not Aschenbach carries out his side of the bargain. He also reveals that Friedrich killed Konstantin (implying that Konstanin's role in the SA purge was covered up and his death reported as a random murder), turning G\u00fcnther against Friedrich and radicalizes him to the Nazi cause.\n\nMartin afterwards sexually assaults his mother, who subsequently falls into a catatonic state much to Friedrich's horror. Now a part of the SS, Martin allows Friedrich, who by decree has inherited the name and title of von Essenbeck, to wed his mother before ordering the two to take [[cyanide]] capsules, which they willingly consume, killing them both. Aschenbach, who now has complete control over Martin, becomes the effective heir to the von Essenbeck steelworks, leaving the empire under Nazi control.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:La caduta degli dei 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Ingrid Thulin]] in ''The Damned''.]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dirk Bogarde]] as Friedrich Bruckmann\n* [[Ingrid Thulin]] as Sophie von Essenbeck\n* [[Helmut Berger]] as Martin von Essenbeck\n* [[Helmut Griem]] as ''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'' Aschenbach\n* [[Renaud Verley]] as G\u00fcnther von Essenbeck\n* [[Umberto Orsini]] as Herbert Thalmann\n* [[Reinhard Kolldehoff]] as Konstantin von Essenbeck\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Elizabeth Thalmann\n* [[Albrecht Schoenhals]] as Joachim von Essenbeck\n* [[Florinda Bolkan]] as Olga\n* [[Nora Ricci]] as the Governess\n* Karin Mittendorf as Thilde Thalmann\n* Valentina Ricci as Erika Thalmann\n* Irina Wanka as Lisa Keller\n* Wolfgang Hillinger as Janek\n* [[Karl-Otto Alberty]] as Lommell\n}}\n\n==\"The German Trilogy\"==\n''The Damned'' has been regarded as the first of Visconti's films described as \"The German Trilogy\", followed by ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'' (1971) and ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]]'' (1973). Author Henry Bacon, in his book ''Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay'' (1998), specifically categorizes these films together in a chapter \"Visconti & Germany\".\n\nVisconti's earlier films had analyzed [[Italy|Italian]] society during the [[Risorgimento]] and postwar periods. [[Peter Bondanella]]'s ''Italian Cinema'' (2002) depicts the trilogy as a move to take a broader view of European politics and culture. Stylistically, \"They emphasize lavish sets and costumes, sensuous lighting, painstakingly slow camerawork, and a penchant for imagery reflecting subjective states or symbolic values\", comments Bondanella.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonadella|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgOl4LWswLQC&q=They+emphasize+lavish+sets+and+costumes%2C+sensuous+lighting%2C+painstakingly+slow+camerawork%2C+and+a+penchant+for+imagery+reflecting+subjective+states+or+symbolic+values&pg=PA264|title=A History of Italian Cinema|date=12 October 2009|page=264|isbn=9781441160690}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Unterach am Attersee 2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Unterach am Attersee]], where the \"Night of Long Knives\" sequence was filmed.]]\nThe film was shot on-location in [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Italy]]; and at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]] in [[Rome]]. Locations included [[Attersee (lake)|Attersee Lake]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Essen]], [[Unterach am Attersee]] (doubling for [[Bad Wiessee]]), and the [[steelworks]] at [[Terni]].\n\n''The Damned'' was the breakthrough role for [[Helmut Berger]], who is given an \"Introducing\" credit (though he had already appeared in Visconti's segment of [[The Witches (1967 film)|''The Witches'']]). At the time, Berger was in a romantic relationship with Visconti. [[Dirk Bogarde]] later expressed disappointment with Visconti for sacrificing his character's development in lieu of a greater focus on Berger's. In his memoirs, Bogarde specifically cites a long scene showing Friedrich immediately after murdering Joachim, instantly becoming overwhelmed with guilt, which was filmed but cut.\n\nComposer [[Maurice Jarre]] was hired by the producers without Visconti's knowledge, who originally wanted the film scored entirely with pre-existing classical music by [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. He was reportedly dissatisfied with the composer's efforts, which he compared disparagingly to his work for [[Doctor Zhivago (film)|''Doctor Zhivago'']], but was forced to include his compositions due to contractual obligations.\n\nThe character \"Aschenbach\" was named for the protagonist of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Death in Venice]]'', which Visconti later adapted into a [[Death in Venice (film)|1971 film of the same name]].\n\n===Editing===\n[[File:La caduta degli dei 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reinhard Kolldehoff]] in the controversial \"Night of the Long Knives\" sequence, which was cut from the US release version.]]\nAfter the first screening of the film, 12 minutes were cut, including a scene where a young Jewish girl hangs herself after being molested.<ref name=\"skep\" /> The US version additionally cut much of the [[Bad Wiessee]] and subsequent [[Night of the Long Knives]] sequence. The footage was later restored on the 2004 DVD release, albeit in [[German language|German]], and is also present with English/German or Italian audio tracks in the 2021 Criterion Collection DVD and blu-ray release.\n\nThe film was given an \"X\" rating by the [[MPAA]] due to a nude incest scene.<ref name=skep/> [[Warner Bros.]] submitted the film for re-classification for its DVD release of the film in 2004. The film's rating was changed from an \"X\" to an \"R\".\n\nThe film was heavily edited when shown on [[CBS television]] late at night, leading one executive to joke that the film should be retitled ''The Darned''. This technically made it the first X-rated film to be shown on American network television.\n\nIn the English-language version, [[Umberto Orsini]]'s voice is re-dubbed by an uncredited actor, due to his thick Italian accent.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened to worldwide acclaim.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} It received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and was named Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review. Among the international cast, Helmut Berger was singled out for his performance as Martin, a vicious [[Sexual deviation|sexual deviant]] who uses his amoral appetites to his own twisted ends. The film was the tenth-most popular movie at the French box office in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=fr&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1970-c22750529&usg=ALkJrhineDwQL3nWRzu5huL7fLnsBt_9Lg |website=Box Office Story |title=1970 Box Office in France}}</ref>\n\nThe film has appeared on critics' lists such as the ''New York Times Best 1000 Movies Ever Made''<ref>{{cite book |first1=Peter M.|last1=Nichols|first2=A.
