Cain]], this was Crawford's first starring role for [[Warner Bros.]], after leaving   [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\nIn 1996, ''Mildred Pierce'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the United States [[Library of Congress]] [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite press release |last=D'Ooge |first=Craig |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9621/nfr.html |title=Mrs. Robinson Finds a Home |agency=Library of Congress |date=December 30, 1996 |access-date=August 24, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|200px|left|From the trailer for the film]]\nMonte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is murdered. The police tell Mildred her first husband, Bert Pierce, has confessed. Mildred protests that he is too kind to commit murder and reveals her story to the officer in flashback.\n\nMildred and Bert are unhappily married. After Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay, Mildred must sell her baked goods to support the family. Bert accuses Mildred of favoring their two daughters over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they separate.\n\nMildred retains custody of 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for high social status and is ashamed of her mother being a baker. Mildred hides her other job as a waitress, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with disdain.\n\nMildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy with an almost-depleted inheritance. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house for a weekend, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With help from her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is successful. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California.\n\nVeda secretly marries well-to-do Ted Forrester for his money and position, but his mother objects. Veda agrees to dissolve the marriage but claims she is pregnant and demands $10,000 from the Forresters. Veda smugly confesses her pregnancy is a sham to Mildred, who tears up the check and throws her out of the house.\n\nBert, too distraught to tell Mildred about Veda's latest escapade, takes her to Wally's nightclub, where Veda performs as a lounge singer. After seeing several sailors in the audience wolf-whistle at Veda in her sexy costume, Mildred begs her to come home. Veda sneers and says her mother can never give her the lifestyle she deserves.\n\nDesperate to reconcile with her daughter, Mildred coaxes Monte into a loveless marriage to improve her social status, with Monte's price being a one-third share of her business to allow him to settle his debts. Veda, eager to live out her dream as a debutante, pretends to reconcile with her mother and moves into Beragon's lavish mansion.\n\nEventually, the cost of supporting Monte and Veda's affluent lifestyles &mdash; and Monte's underhanded ploy to retain his share in the business while causing his wife to forfeit her own &mdash; bankrupts Mildred, forcing her to sell the restaurant chain. After driving to his beach house to confront Monte, Mildred finds Veda in his arms. Veda scornfully tells her mother that Monte intends to marry her after divorcing Mildred, who runs to her car in tears, dropping a gun she didn't use on Monte. When Monte tells Veda he would never marry her because she is a \"rotten little tramp,\" she shoots him with Mildred's gun.\n\nVeda begs her mother to help conceal the murder; Mildred reluctantly agrees. Fed up with Wally's misdeeds &mdash; helping Veda blackmail the Forresters, hiring her to sing in his seedy nightclub, assenting to Monte's business move against her, and making constant sexual overtures toward her &mdash; Mildred tries to pin the murder on Wally by luring him to the beach house. Police officers arrest Wally when he flees in panic after seeing Monte's body. Still, the investigating officer tells Mildred that Wally cannot be the killer because he has no motive.\n\nIn the present, the detectives admit they knew all along that Veda committed the murder. Mildred tries to apologize as her daughter is sent to jail, but Veda rebuffs her. Mildred leaves the police station to find Bert waiting for her outside.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joan Crawford]] as Mildred Pierce Beragon\n* [[Jack Carson]] as Wally Fay\n* [[Zachary Scott]] as Monte Beragon\n* [[Eve Arden]] as Ida Corwin\n* [[Ann Blyth]] as Veda Pierce Forrester \n* [[Bruce Bennett]] as Albert \"Bert\" Pierce\n* [[Butterfly McQueen]] as Lottie\n* [[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]] as Mrs. Maggie Biederhof\n* [[Moroni Olsen]] as Inspector Peterson\n* [[Veda Ann Borg]] as Miriam Ellis\n* Jo Ann Marlowe as Kay Pierce<ref>{{cite web |title=Mildred Pierce |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/24502-MILDRED-PIERCE?sid=068de768-8911-44e5-affd-4ed6084a7221&sr=12.200211&cp=1&pos=0 |website=catalog.afi.com |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=13 December 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Charles Trowbridge]] as Lawyer (uncredited)\n* [[Garry Owen (actor)|Garry Owen]] as the Policeman on the pier (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Comparison to the novel==\nAlthough James M. Cain was often labeled a \"hard-boiled crime writer\", his novel ''[[Mildred Pierce]]'' (1941) was mostly a psychological work, with little violence. The adaptation, released four years later, was designed as a thriller, and a murder was introduced into the plot.<ref>{{Amg movie|32653|Mildred Pierce}}</ref>\n\nThe novel spans nine years (from 1931 to 1940), whereas the film is set from 1939 to the 1940s and spans only four years. Its characters do not age as a consequence. Mildred's physical appearance does not change, although her costumes become more elegant as her business grows. Veda ages from around 13 to 17. Mildred is more of a tycoon in the film; her restaurants are glamorous places, and she owns a whole chain (\"Mildred's\") instead of the novel's three. Evil, spoiled Veda, who is prodigiously talented and brilliantly devious in the novel, is somewhat less formidable in the film. All references to the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and the [[Prohibition era]], which are important in the novel, are absent from the screenplay.\n\nThe plot is simplified and the number of characters reduced. Veda's training and success as a singer (including her performance at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) were dropped in the film and her music teachers only mentioned in passing. Lucy Gessler, a key character in the novel and Mildred's good friend, is eliminated. Ida, Mildred's boss at the restaurant where she works as a waitress, is given much of Gessler's wise-cracking personality.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nMonte does not die in the novel, and Veda never goes to jail. The murder portion of the story was invented by the filmmakers because the [[Hays Code|censorship code]] of that time required evildoers to be punished for their misdeeds.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard L. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/damekimonohollyw00leff/page/n304 270]\u2013271, 286\u2013287 |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |url=https://archive.org/details/damekimonohollyw00leff |url-access=limited |date=6 July 2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-9011-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Black |first=Gregory D. |year=1996 |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=41\u201342 |isbn=0-521-56592-8}}</ref> The 2011 HBO miniseries ''[[Mildred Pierce (miniseries)|Mildred Pierce]]'' follows the novel more faithfully in this respect.\n\n==Production==\nThe working title for ''Mildred Pierce'' was ''House on the Sand'';<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/321/Mildred-Pierce/notes.html \"Notes\"] on [[TCM.com]]</ref> and filming began on December 7, 1944.<ref name=tcmart>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/321/Mildred-Pierce/articles.html \"Mildred Pierce\"] on [[TCM.com]]</ref> [[Ralph Bellamy]], [[Donald Woods (actor)|Donald Woods]], and [[George Coulouris]] were considered for the role of Bert, while [[Bonita Granville]], [[Virginia Weidler]], and [[Martha Vickers]] were considered for Veda.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Scenes for the film were shot in Glendale, California and Malibu, California. Permission had to be granted from the U.S. Navy to shoot in Malibu because of wartime restrictions.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nIn 1942, two years earlier, [[Joan Crawford]] had been released from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] due to a mutual agreement. Crawford campaigned for the lead role in ''Mildred Pierce'', which most lead actresses did not want because of the implied age as mother of a teenage daughter. Warner Bros. and director [[Michael Curtiz]] originally wanted [[Bette Davis]] to play the title role, but she declined. Curtiz did not want Crawford to play the part. He campaigned for [[Barbara Stanwyck]], who was working on ''[[My Reputation]]'' (1946) at the time. When he learned that Stanwyck was not going to be cast, he then tried to recruit either [[Olivia de Havilland]] or [[Joan Fontaine]] to play Mildred, but both were only in their 20s. He ultimately approved Crawford's casting after seeing her screen test. Even so, the director and the star were often at odds on the set, with producer [[Jerry Wald]] acting as peacemaker.<ref name=tcmart /><ref>Ben Mankowitz, intro to the Turner Classic Movies presentation of ''Mildred Pierce'' on February 3, 2013</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box-office success.

A review in ''The New York Times'' stated that, although Crawford gave \"a sincere and generally effective characterization,\" the film \"lacks the driving force of stimulating drama,\" and it did \"not seem reasonable that a level-headed person like Mildred Pierce, who builds a fabulously successful chain of restaurants on practically nothing, could be so completely dominated by a selfish and grasping daughter, who spells trouble in capital letters.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1945/09/29/archives/the-screen-mildred-pierce-warner-drama-starring-joan-crawford-new.html |title=THE SCREEN; 'Mildred Pierce' Warner Drama Starring Joan Crawford, New Bill of the Strand--Western Thriller Moves Into Gotham |date=September 29, 1945 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWilliam Brogdon of ''Variety'' liked the film, especially the screenplay, and wrote<blockquote>At first reading James M. Cain's novel of the same title might not suggest screenable material, but the cleanup job has resulted in a class feature, showmanly produced by Jerry Wald and tellingly directed by Michael Curtiz ... The dramatics are heavy but so skillfully handled that they never cloy. Joan Crawford reaches a peak of her acting career in this pic. Ann Blyth, as the daughter, scores dramatically in her first genuine acting assignment.

Despite all kinds of chances to go berserk as a Cain mother, Miss Crawford remains subdued and reasonable, like most of the rest of a highly competent cast.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McCarten |first=John |author-link=John McCarten |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1945/10/06/1945-10-06-095-tny-cards-000020290 |date=October 6, 1945 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |page=95 |url-access=subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2005 review, Jeremiah Kipp gave the film a mixed review:<blockquote>''Mildred Pierce'' is melodramatic trash, constructed like a reliable [[Tragedy#Aristotle|Aristotelian]] warhorse where characters have planted the seeds of their own doom in the first act, only to have grief-stricken revelations at the climax. Directed by studio favorite Michael Curtiz in [[German Expressionism|German Expressionistic]] mode, which doesn't quite go with the California beaches and sunlight but sets the bleak tone of domestic film noir, and scored by [[Max Steiner]] with a sensational bombast that's rousing even when it doesn't match the quieter, pensive mood of individual scenes, ''Mildred Pierce'' is professionally executed and moves at a brisk clip.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/mildred-pierce-dvd/|last=Kipp |first=Jeremiah |title=DVD Review: Michael Curtiz's ''Mildred Pierce'' on Warner Home Video |work=Slant Magazine |date=June 15, 2005 |access-date=February 8, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1978, historian June Sochen argued the film lies at the intersection of the \"weepie\" and \"independent woman\" genres of the 1930s and 1940s. It accentuates common ground of the two: Women must be submissive, live through others, and remain in the home.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sochen |first=June |title='Mildred Pierce' and Women in Film |journal=[[American Quarterly]] |date=January 1978 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201320 |doi=10.2307/2712276 |jstor=2712276}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an 87% rating, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10.
