The film is based on the [[The Sum of Us|1990 play of the same name]] by [[David Stevens (screenwriter)|David Stevens]], who also wrote the screenplay. The film stars [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]. The screen adaptation mimics the play's device of breaking the [[fourth wall]] with direct to camera conversational asides by both Harry and Jeff Mitchell.\n\n==Plot==\nWidower Harry Mitchell (Thompson) lives with his gay son Jeff (Crowe), with both men struggling in their searches for true love. Harry is completely comfortable with his son's sexuality, and is almost over-eager in his support for his son's search for a boyfriend. Harry meets an attractive but judgmental divorcee through a dating service, and this leads to some conflict between the two main characters. However, when Harry suffers a stroke and loses the power of speech, the story takes a darker turn, becoming a meditation on the enduring strength of love, both familial and romantic, in the face of adversity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Harry Mitchell\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Jeff Mitchell\n* [[John Polson]] as Greg\n* [[Deborah Kennedy]] as Joyce Johnson\n* Joss Moroney as Young Jeff\n* Mitch Mathews as Gran\n* Julie Herbert as Mary\n* Des James as Football Coach\n* Mick Campbell as Footballer\n* Donny Muntz as Ferry Captain\n* [[Jan Adele]] as Barmaid\n* [[Rebekah Elmaloglou]] as Jenny Johnson\n* Lola Nixon as Desiree\n* Sally Cahill as Greg's Mother\n* [[Bob Baines]] as Greg's Father\n\n==Box office==\n''The Sum of Us'' grossed $3,827,456 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |title=''Film Victoria \u2013 Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'' |access-date=23 November 2010 |archive-date=23 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723234802/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was nominated for Best Film and Stevens' screenplay won [[AACTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[1994 Australian Film Institute Awards]], while Polson and Kennedy were nominated for best supporting actors, and [[Frans Vanderburg]] for editing and the sound team.
