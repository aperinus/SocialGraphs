A sequel to the 2008 film ''[[Ip Man (film)|Ip Man]]'', ''Ip Man 2'' was directed by [[Wilson Yip]] and stars [[Donnie Yen]], who reprises the leading role. Continuing after the events of the earlier film, the sequel centres on Ip's early life in [[British Hong Kong]]. He attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun, but faces rivalry from other practitioners, including the local master of [[Hung Ga]] martial arts, Hung Chun-nam ([[Sammo Hung]]), and later the British [[boxing]] champion Taylor \"The Twister\" Miller ([[Darren Shahlavi]]).\n\nProducer [[Raymond Wong (film presenter)|Raymond Wong]] first announced a sequel before ''Ip Man''{{'s}} theatrical release in December 2008. For ''Ip Man 2'', the filmmakers intended to focus on the relationship between Ip and his most famed disciple, [[Bruce Lee]]. However, they were unable to finalize [[film rights]] with Lee's descendants and decided to briefly portray Lee as a child. [[Principal photography]] for ''Ip Man 2'' began in August 2009 and concluded in November; filming took place inside a studio located in [[Shanghai]]. For the sequel, Yip aimed to create a more dramatic martial arts film in terms of story and characterization; Wong's son, screenwriter Edmond Wong, wanted the film to explore the treatment of [[Hongkongers|Hong Kongers]] during the colonial era and [[Western world|Western]] perceptions of Chinese martial arts.\n\n''Ip Man 2'' is the second film in the [[Ip Man (film series)|\"Ip Man\" film series]]. It premiered in [[Beijing]] on 21 April 2010, and was released in Hong Kong on 29 April 2010. The film met with positive reviews, with particular praise for the film's storytelling and [[Sammo Hung]]'s martial arts choreography. The film grossed over HK$13 million on its opening weekend, immediately surpassing ''Ip Man''{{'s}} opening weekend gross. During its theatrical run, ''Ip Man 2'' brought in over HK$43 million domestically, and its domestic theatrical gross made it the highest grossing Hong Kong film released during the first half of 2010. In total, ''Ip Man 2'' grossed an estimated US$49 million worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Ip-Man-Legend-of-the-Grand-Master#tab=summary|title = Ip Man: Legend of the Grand Master (2011) - Financial Information}}</ref> This amount does not include successful DVD sales all over United States, Asia and Europe.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Wing Chun]] master [[Ip Man]] and his family move to [[Hong Kong]] in 1949 after their [[Ip Man (film)|escape]] from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied]] [[Foshan]]. In 1950, Ip attempts to open a school to propagate his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but struggles to attract students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day, a young man named Wong Shun Leung appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight, but is easily defeated. Wong storms off and brings a gang of his friends to take revenge, but Ip easily beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by Ip's skills, Wong and his friends become Ip's first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.\n\nWong is later confronted by some thuggish [[Hung Ga]] students while posting promotional posters for Ip's school. One of them, Kei, challenges Wong to a fight and loses, but his vengeful friends take Wong hostage and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local [[wet market]] as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Fighting their way outside and hopelessly outnumbered, Ip and Wong are rescued by Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist, former bandit, and ex-rival of Ip, who comes to their aid with his own gang.\n\nThe students' master and head of the coalition of Hong Kong's martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to partake in a special ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong, and Jin are subsequently arrested by Fatso, a deputy chief of the [[Hong Kong Police Department|HKPD]], for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso secretly meet with Superintendent Wallace, the HKPD's [[Corruption|corrupt]] British commandant, to deliver [[protection racket|protection]] money collected from both the local shops and martial art schools.\n\nIp attends the ceremony and easily defeats his first two challengers, before battling the last challenger, being Hung himself, to a draw. Ip is allowed to keep running his school in exchange for paying protection fees, but he declines to do so. In response, Hung has his students deliberately loiter in front of the Wing Chun school and harass prospective students, resulting in a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced by his landlady to leave the property he leased for his school; the disciples resort to training in the local park.\n\nIp confronts Hung, who blames him for the recent events since he refused to pay, while Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students and subservience to the foreigners. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and decides to finish off his earlier duel with Ip. Hung's son suddenly appears during this encounter, and Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking the boy, while also suggesting that he prioritize spending time with his family over settling their dispute. Ip's wise counsel earns him Hung's respect. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung gives him and his students free tickets to a martial arts exhibition arranged by Wallace and Fatso.\n\nAt the exhibition, the various martial arts schools seek to promote themselves and by extension, Chinese culture. However, Wallace's guest, boxer Taylor \"The Twister\" Miller, openly insults and assaults the students, causing a brawl that the masters try to quell. Hung demands that Twister apologize; in response, Twister challenges Hung to a fight, saying that he will apologize for his behavior if Hung wins. At first, Hung's wide range of skills and techniques allow him to hold his own. However, most of his counterattacks have little effect on the younger and more fit Twister, and he is slowly worn down by the boxer's powerful punches. Ip tries to persuade Hung to concede, but the old man refuses, and even stops Ip from throwing in the towel himself. In the final round, Hung suffers from an [[asthma]] attack, allowing Twister to gain the upper hand, and Hung is eventually beaten to death against the ropes.\n\nNews of Hung's death spreads throughout the city, enraging the Chinese populace. Wallace's superior scolds him for the turn of events and Wallace then arrests and tortures Ip's friend, newspaper editor Leung Kan, for publishing the news; Fatso intervenes and releases him with no charges. A press conference is held the following day, where Wallace lies about Hung's death being accidental and Twister announces that, in order to clear his name, he will accept a challenge from any Chinese martial artist. However, he continues to disrespect the Chinese and boasts that none of them have the courage to face him. Ip arrives and challenges Twister to a fight, while Fatso secretly meets with Kan and offers him compromising information on Wallace. As his pregnant wife goes into labor, Ip prepares for his match with Twister.\n \nThe match starts badly for Ip due to his unfamiliarity with Western boxing, allowing Twister to knock him down several times, but he gradually manages to use his Wing Chun techniques and superior speed to even the odds. During the match, Wallace and his allies attempt to rig the match in Twister's favor, refusing to penalize him for an illegal hit and issuing a ruling that Ip cannot use kicking attacks or he will be disqualified. After seeing visions of Hung and remembering his advice to focus on weakening Twister rather than trade blows with him, Ip switches up his strategy, crippling Twister's arms and eventually managing to beat him into unconsciousness with a series of strikes to the head and ears. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace's superior arrives and arrests him for corruption and abuse of power.\n\nIp addresses the audience, stating his wish for everyone to respect each other despite the differences between their race, culture, or status. Both the Western and Chinese audiences give him a standing ovation, while Twister's manager angrily disproves, stands up & he walks away in disgust. Ip goes home, reunites with his family, and meets his newborn son, Ip Ching. Sometime later, Wong introduces his master to a boy named [[Bruce Lee]], who wishes to learn Wing Chun in order to beat up people he doesn't like. An amused Ip smiles and simply tells him to come back when he has grown up.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as [[Ip Man]] (\u8449\u554f), the sole practitioner of the martial art [[Wing Chun]].

Prior to principal photography, Hung had undergone a major [[cardiac surgery]]. When he returned to the set, his dramatic scenes in the film were filmed first, with his fight sequences being filmed last.<ref name=\"Hung vs. Yen\" /> Hung performed his own stunts in the film, which led to him receiving several injuries during filming. While filming a scene, Hung was struck in the face by co-star Darren Shahlavi. He insisted on completing the shoot before going to the hospital. Not wanting his injuries to hinder the production progress, Hung spent five hours trying to complete the scene before going to the hospital for four stitches.<ref name=\"Sammo Hung Gets Four Stitches\">{{Cite web| title = HKSAR Film No Top 10 Box Office: 2010.05.04 SAMMO HUNG GETS FOUR STITCHES FOR IP MAN 2| publisher =[[Ta Kung Pao]] | date = 3 May 2010 | url = http://hktopten.blogspot.com/2010/05/20100504-sammo-hung-gets-four-stitches.html| access-date = 4 May 2010}}</ref> After the completion of filming, Hung expressed that he was dissatisfied with the fight sequences involving his character, presumably due to his heart condition.
