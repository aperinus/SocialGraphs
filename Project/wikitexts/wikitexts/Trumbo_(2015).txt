However, his active membership in the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the USA]] draws the contempt of staunchly [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] entertainment-industry figures such as columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] and actor [[John Wayne]].\n\nTrumbo is one of [[Hollywood Ten|10 screenwriters]] subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) regarding [[Communist propaganda]] in Hollywood films. They refuse to directly answer questions, confident that a liberal majority on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] will overturn their convictions for [[contempt of Congress]]. Trumbo's friend [[Edward G. Robinson]], who supports the cause, sells [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s 1887 painting ''[[Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy]]'' to raise money for their legal defense fund. The unexpected deaths of Justices [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Wiley Rutledge]] and [[Frank Murphy]] ruin Trumbo's plan to appeal. In 1950, Trumbo serves 11 months in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland|Federal Correctional Institution in Ashland, Kentucky]].\n\nAs the [[Hollywood Blacklist]] expands to exclude more communists and communist sympathizers from working in the industry, Trumbo and his comrades are abandoned by Robinson and producer Buddy Ross, who disavow them to protect their careers. Trumbo is released from prison, but he remains blacklisted and his finances \u2013 and family life \u2013 become increasingly strained. He resorts to giving the screenplay for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' to his friend [[Ian McLellan Hunter]], to take credit and a share of the money, and eventually the [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. Selling his idyllic lakeside home and moving to a house in the city, he goes to work as a pseudonymous screenwriter for the low-budget [[King Brothers Productions]], also farming out the writing of [[B-movie]] screenplays to fellow blacklisted writers. He puts his wife Cleo and teenage children to work as his support staff, adding to domestic conflict. King Brothers' film ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'', an original story by Trumbo under a [[Pen name|pseudonym]], receives an Academy Award he cannot claim. His blacklisted friend Arlen Hird dies from cancer, destitute, but an attempt by Hedda Hopper's [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|allies]] to intimidate the head of King Brothers into firing Trumbo fails completely.\n\nOver time, industry suspicion of Trumbo's ghostwriting develops, but he is careful not to confirm it. In 1960, actor [[Kirk Douglas]] recruits him to write the screenplay for his epic film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', and director [[Otto Preminger]] recruits him to script ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]''. Both men publicly credit him as the screenwriter, despite Hopper's futile efforts to intimidate Douglas into dropping Trumbo. By early 1961, the effectiveness of the Blacklist had been broken to the point where newly elected [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] publicly endorsed ''Spartacus'', and Trumbo and others are able to begin rebuilding their careers. Ten years later, finally receiving his due accolades from Hollywood, Trumbo speaks about how the Blacklist victimized them all: those who stood by their principles and lost their jobs, and also those who compromised their principles to keep them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Bryan Cranston]] as [[Dalton Trumbo]]\n*[[Diane Lane]] as Cleo Fincher Trumbo\n*[[Helen Mirren]] as [[Hedda Hopper]]\n*[[Louis C.K.]] as Arlen Hird{{Efn|\"Arlen Hird\" is a composite character based on [[Alvah Bessie]], [[Lester Cole]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Albert Maltz]], and [[Samuel Ornitz]].<ref name=\"rapold\">{{cite news|last1=Rapold|first1=Nicolas|title='Trumbo' Recalls the Hunters and the Hunted of Hollywood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/movies/trumbo-recalls-the-hunters-and-the-hunted-of-hollywood.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>}}\n*[[Elle Fanning]] as Nikola Trumbo\n** [[Madison Wolfe]] plays a younger Nikola\n* [[Mattie Liptak]] as [[Christopher Trumbo|Chris Trumbo]] (13 to 17)\n*[[John Goodman]] as [[King Brothers Productions|Frank King]]\n*[[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Edward G.

film depicts actor [[Edward G. Robinson]] betraying his friend Dalton Trumbo and others by naming them as [[Communism in the United States|communists]] before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Robinson testified four times before the committee and eventually stated that he had been a dupe of communist front organizations.<ref>Ross, Steven J. ''Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics'', Oxford University Press, 2011</ref> According to the transcript of a hearing on April 30, 1952, Robinson gave the following testimony: \"Well, you had Albert Maltz, and you have Dalton Trumbo, and you have\u2014what is the other fellow, the top fellow who they say is the commissar out there?\", and after being prompted by his questioner (Mr. Walter), Robinson continued: \"Yes, John Howard Lawson. I knew Frank Tuttle. I didn't know Dmytryk at all. There are the Buchmans, that I know, Sidney Buchman and all that sort of thing. It never entered my mind that any of these people were Communists.\"<ref>''Testimony of Edward G. Robinson before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, April, 1952''. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1952, [https://archive.org/stream/communistinfiltr07unit#page/2421/mode/1up p. 2421].</ref> His testimony is re-enacted in the film, but with alterations, including to some of the names and their order. For instance, instead of John Howard Lawson, the composite character, Arlen Hird, is identified as \"the [[commissar]]\".<ref>''Trumbo'', [[Apple iTunes]] [[M4V]] video file, beginning at minute 46:20.</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Notelist}}\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.trumbomovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|3203606|Trumbo}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|trumbo}}\n\n{{Jay Roach}}\n\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about the Hollywood blacklist]]\n[[Category:Films about screenwriters]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kentucky]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1947]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1949]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1950]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1951]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1952]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1954]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1957]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1958]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1960]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1961]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jay Roach]]\n[[Category:Bleecker Street films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Edward G.
