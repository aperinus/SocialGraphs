It also stars [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Ray Sharkey]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[Paul Mazursky]], and [[Rebecca Schaeffer]]. Schaeffer's appearance in the film served as the catalyst for her murder one month after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098261/trivia?item=tr2872402|title=Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989) Trivia|publisher=iMDB|accessdate=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRecently widowed Clare, a former television [[sitcom]] star, invites her next-door neighbor Lisabeth to stay with her while Lisabeth's house is [[Fumigation#tent fumigation|fumigated]]. Lisabeth's brother Peter, a playwright, arrives with his new bride To-Bel, an [[African Americans|African-American]] woman. To-Bel had a fling in Hawaii with Howard, Lisabeth's ex-husband, who shows up unexpectedly and begs Lisabeth to take him back. (To-Bel &mdash; who had no idea she slept with Lisabeth's ex-husband before marrying her brother &mdash; describes the coincidence as \"a freaky little act of God.\")\n\nClare's [[Chicano]] [[Domestic worker|manservant]] Juan owes $5,000 in gambling debts to June-Bug, an Asian gangster. When he is unable to collect the debt, June-Bug slashes Juan's cheek as a warning to pay up. Juan turns to Lisabeth's chauffeur, Frank, for help. Frank bets he can seduce Clare before Juan can bed Lisabeth. Frank agrees to pay $5,000 if Juan wins &mdash; on the condition Juan sleeps with him if he loses. Juan accepts Frank's challenge. Frank, unable to seduce Clare, laces her drink with sedatives and tricks Juan into thinking he bedded her. Juan sleeps with Lisabeth but denies it to avoid tarnishing her reputation. Juan honors the bet and sleeps with Frank.\n\nHoward and Lisabeth's teenage son, Willie, has cancer which is in remission. After he confides to Juan he had a [[Nocturnal emission|wet dream]], Juan loans him [[Pornographic film|porno]] tapes and encourages him to [[Masturbation|masturbate]]. To Willie's surprise, To-Bel appears as a [[Leather subculture|leather]]-clad [[Dominance and submission|dominant]] in one of the tapes. The tape inadvertently gets mixed up with one of Clare's old sitcom episodes. When Clare shows it to guests after Sidney's wake &mdash; not realizing the tape is pornographic &mdash; To-Bel quickly cuts the power to avoid embarrassment. When Willie gives her the tape, To-Bel is so grateful that she agrees to help him lose his virginity by sleeping with him.\n\nClare attempts a comeback soon after her husband Sidney dies (though she is haunted by his ghost). She suffers from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] and enlists help from Mo, a paunchy Beverly Hills weight loss doctor. She invites a reporter for brunch to write a feature about her comeback. The brunch is a disaster: everyone exposes their partners' infidelity or gleefully reveals their own sexual indiscretions. After Clare's [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] Rosa frightens her with [[Aztec philosophy]] cloaked in [[New Age]] babble, the reporter abruptly leaves and Clare accuses everyone of sabotaging her comeback.\n\nMo persuades Clare and Sidney's much younger daughter, Zandra, to accompany him to [[Africa]] &mdash;  ostensibly on a hunger project, though he warns her they will share a tent there. After Peter sleeps with Clare, To-Bel and Howard rekindle their relationship and leave together. Juan and Lisabeth fall in love and book a romantic holiday. As their limousine is about to leave, June-Bug returns, but Frank gives Juan the money to repay his debt. Sidney's ghost appears again to pester Clare. After she persuades him she must undergo [[Self-help|self-improvement]] alone, Sidney's ghost vanishes for good.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Clare Lipkin\n* [[Ray Sharkey]] as Frank\n* [[Mary Woronov]] as Lisabeth Hepburn-Saravian\n* [[Robert Beltran]] as Juan\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Peter\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Howard\n* [[Arnetia Walker]] as To-Bel\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as Dr. Mo Van De Kamp\n* [[Paul Mazursky]] as Sidney Lipkin\n* [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] as Zandra\n* [[Barret Oliver]] as Willie Saravian\n* [[Edith Diaz]] as Rosa\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as June-Bug\n* [[Michael Feinstein]] as himself\n* [[Frank Welker]] as special vocal effects (voice only)\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* [[Little Richard]] appears in the film uncredited.\n\n==Awards==\nWoronov was nominated for a 1989 [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female]] for her role.\n\n==Home media==\n''Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'' was released on [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] [[Germany|German]] [[DVD]] on May 18, 2005 and in [[Italy]] with its [[Italian language|Italian]] title, ''Scene di lotta di classe a Beverly Hills''.
