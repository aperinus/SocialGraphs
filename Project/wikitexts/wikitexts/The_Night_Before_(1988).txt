Reeves plays Winston Connelly, the so-called [[high school]] [[nerd]] and vice president of the [[astronomy]] club. Loughlin plays Tara Mitchell, the pretty and popular head [[cheerleader]] who also happens to be the local [[police chief|police chief's]] daughter.  The [[Tagline]] was: \"You lost your father's car, sold your [[prom]] date and a guy called 'Tito' wants you dead. It's a date that's the time of your life.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nTeen Winston regains consciousness in an alley in the middle of the night with no idea of how he got there. He's dressed in a white tuxedo jacket.\n\nThrough a series of flashbacks, he remembers that he was waylaid on his way to the prom the night before. In the meantime, he has to figure out what happened to his wallet, his car keys, his [[prom]] date, and why a pimp named \"Tito\" wants him dead.\n\nWinston finds a parking stub in his pocket. \"[[Danny Boy]]\" offers to open, and then start the car. Naive, he agrees, but once Danny gets it started, he leaves with it.\n\nAt Tara's house to take her to the prom, she tells Winston that her losing a bet on a [[American football|football]] game is why she has to go to prom with the flattered but clueless [[nerd]] Winston. Her police officer father warns him to take care of his one and only daughter and to have her home by midnight. \n\nHaving gotten off the freeway and lost, Winston manages to get them lost in the [[ghetto]] in East LA. At a stop light, a man reaches through the driver's window to rob them, but they manage to shake him off after a few blocks. Unfortunately he got Winston's wallet.\n\nGoing back to a bar he had been earlier, Winston remembers having been there with Tara.  The [[prostitute|hooker]] Rhonda, who had warned him not to consume a 'free' drink from the bartender, greets his familiarly. \n\nRhonda reminds Winston accidentally sold Tara to the diminutive [[pimp]] Tito for 1500 dollars, and then got thrown out of the bar, told to meet him at dawn to fight. \n\nWinston spends the remainder of the evening searching for Tara in the seedy underworld of [[East LA]] whilst seeking to avoid Tito's wrath after Tito discovers the identity of Tara's father.\n\nComing across a guy in the street, it turns out he was the lookout for a toy story robbery. Winston is used by the thieves to get away from the cops. In return, they help him with a lead. \n\nAt a brothel, Winston finds out Tito sold Tara to another pimp, so he starts using the 1500 to locate her. He pays a Hispanic man to drive around, asking for her. Winston arrives at the hotel where she's being held for yet a third pimp, who's about to ship her to Morocco. \n\nIn the end, Winston escapes with Tara from the pimp, recovers his dad's car from Danny Boy, who had planned to sell it to Tito and gets the girl (when she realises all that he did for her).\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Winston Connelly\n* [[Lori Loughlin]] as Tara Mitchell\n* [[Theresa Saldana]] as Rhonda\n* [[Trinidad Silva]] as Tito\n* [[Suzanne Snyder]] as Lisa\n\n==Production==\nIt was filmed and set entirely in Los Angeles, California.
