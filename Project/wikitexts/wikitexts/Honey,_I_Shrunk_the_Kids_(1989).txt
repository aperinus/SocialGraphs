It is the first installment of a [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise)|film franchise]] and served as the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of [[Joe Johnston]]. The film stars [[Rick Moranis]], [[Matt Frewer]], [[Marcia Strassman]], and [[Kristine Sutherland]]. In the film, a struggling inventor accidentally shrinks his kids, along with the neighbors' kids, down to the size of a quarter-inch. After being accidentally thrown out with the trash, they must work together and venture their way back through a backyard wilderness filled with dangerous insects and man-made hazards.\n\n''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 23, 1989, and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]. It was an unexpected box office success, grossing $222&nbsp;million worldwide (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|222|1989|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) and becoming the [[1989 in film|highest-grossing live-action Disney film of all time]], a record it held for five years. Its success led to two sequels, beginning with ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'' in 1992, as well as a [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise)#Television|television series]] and several [[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise)#Theme park attractions|theme-park attractions]]. An animated short film, ''[[Roger Rabbit short films|Tummy Trouble]]'' starring [[Roger Rabbit]], was shown in theatres with the film during its box office run.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be between 400-700 words. Count at 588 (January 2022) -->\nQuirky scientist and inventor Wayne Szalinski has been designing a ray gun machine capable of shrinking and growing objects, but cannot get it to work properly. His obsession with the machine worries his hardworking wife Diane, teenage daughter Amy, and aspiring-inventor son Nick. Next door, Big Russ Thompson, his wife Mae, and their younger son Ron are preparing for a fishing trip. Their elder son, Little Russ, is less than enthusiastic, as his interests often clash with his father's. \n\nShortly after Wayne leaves for a conference, Ron accidentally hits a baseball through the Szalinski's attic window and into the machine, turning it on and blocking its targeting laser. Caught by his brother, Ron is forced to confess to the Szalinski kids. Ron and Nick enter the attic to retrieve the ball and clean up the mess, and the activated machine shrinks them. Amy and Little Russ suffer the same fate when they go searching for their siblings.\n\nAt his conference, Wayne is laughed off the stage for failing to provide proof that his machine works. He enters the attic upon returning home; the shrunken children try to get his attention, but their voices are only loud enough to be heard by the family dog, Quark. Already frustrated, Wayne discovers the broken window and snaps, repeatedly striking the machine. He sweeps the debris, along with the kids, into a dust pan and trash bag. The four manage to escape, only to discover that the trash bag is now at the curb; they must make their way back home through the Szalinski's overgrown yard. \n\nMeanwhile, the Thompson and Szalinski parents become uneasy at their children's absence. Mae and Big Russ cancel their fishing trip and file a missing persons report with the police. Wayne eventually pieces together what happened, but accidentally activates some sprinklers while searching the yard. As a result, Amy is nearly drowned in mud, but Little Russ rescues and revives her. Wayne eventually reveals the truth to Diane, and she joins in the search. Later, she convinces Wayne to share the information with the Thompsons, but they remain skeptical.\n\nThe kids feast on one of Nick's discarded [[Oatmeal Creme Pie]] cookies, and use a crumb to capture a friendly [[Ant#Communication|forager ant]], naming it \"Antie\" and riding it toward the house. As night falls, the group takes shelter in a [[Lego]] piece. Amy and Little Russ begin to express feelings for one another, and share a kiss. The kids are later attacked by a [[scorpion]], but Antie, at the cost of its own life, helps them to drive the scorpion away. \n\nThe next morning, Nick's friend Tommy arrives to mow the lawn. The kids are forced to seek shelter in an earthworm tunnel, barely escaping the vortex caused by the mower, which Wayne and Diane shut off just in time. The kids hitch a ride on Quark, and enter the house, but Nick falls into Wayne's bowl of [[Cheerios]] and is nearly eaten. Quark bites Wayne's ankle to get his attention; he discovers the kids' presence, and works to repair the machine. \n\nBoth families meet in the attic, and the kids use [[charades]] to inform Wayne that the baseball blocked the laser, which previously overheated targets and caused them to explode. Wayne corrects the problem, and Big Russ volunteers as a test subject; the test is successful, and he and the kids are later restored to their original sizes.\n\nMonths later at Thanksgiving, the Szalinskis and Thompsons have become good friends and are toasting over an enlarged turkey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Wayne Szalinski\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Russell \"Big Russ\" Thompson Sr.\n* [[Marcia Strassman]] as Diane Szalinski\n* [[Kristine Sutherland]] as Mae Thompson\n* [[Thomas Wilson Brown]] as Russell \"Little Russ\" Thompson Jr.\n* [[Jared Rushton]] as Ronald \"Ron\" Thompson\n* [[Amy O'Neill]] as Amy Szalinski\n* [[Robert Oliveri]] as Nick Szalinski\n* [[Carl Steven]] as Tommy Pervis\n* [[Mark L. Taylor]] as Donald \"Don\" Forrester\n* [[Kimmy Robertson]] as Gloria Forrester\n* [[Lou Cutell]] as Dr. Brainard\n* Laura Waterbury as Female Cop\n* Trevor Galtress as Male Cop\n* Martin Aylett as Harold Boorstein\n* Janet Sunderland as Lauren Boorstein\n* [[Craig Richard Nelson]] as Prof. Frederickson (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Special Vocal Effects (voice)\n\n==Production==\nThe project was originally brought to [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]] by [[Stuart Gordon]] and [[Brian Yuzna]]. Gordon was hired to direct the film and Yuzna to produce. The film was written as ''Teeny Weenies'' by [[Stuart Gordon]], [[Ed Naha]], and [[Brian Yuzna]]. [[Tom Schulman]] was later added as a screenwriter. Gordon originally prepped the film but had to drop out as director shortly before filming began due to illness. [[Joe Johnston]] was brought in to replace him while Penny Finkleman Cox replaced Yuzna as producer.\n\nAs the title ''Teeny Weenies'' seemed to appeal more to a child demographic, the name was changed to ''Grounded'' to appeal to a more mature audience. That name was later rejected in favor of ''The Big Backyard''. ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'', based on a line of dialogue from the film, ultimately became its title.\n\nThe film was heavily influenced by 1950s fare, such as ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]''.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQgaJ1MZFg | title=The Making of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' | year=1989 | access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nJudy Taylor, Mike Fenton, and Lynda Gordon were the casting directors. Before [[Rick Moranis]] was cast as Wayne Szalinski, the script was written with [[Chevy Chase]] in mind because of his popularity in ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''. He was filming the second sequel, ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', and was too busy to portray Wayne.\n\n[[John Candy]] was also considered for the role of Wayne. He declined, but suggested to Johnston that his friend (and costar of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]''), [[Rick Moranis]], would be a good choice. [[Marcia Strassman]] portrays Wayne's wife, Diane, who is having marital troubles with him.\n\n[[Matt Frewer]] and [[Kristine Sutherland]] portray Russ and Mae Thompson, the Szalinskis' next door neighbors and parents of Russ Jr. and Ron. Russ is very demanding of Russ Jr. and can't understand why he isn't more interested in [[Masculinity|masculine]] things such as football and fishing (until the end of the film, when he learns to accept him for who he is). He is dimwitted and clumsy and secretly takes to cigarettes when he is nervous or scared. On the other hand, Mae is a very nice person and friendly with the Szalinskis.\n\nThe film needed four teenagers to play the leads. Russ Jr., portrayed by [[Thomas Wilson Brown]], seems to be interested in Amy, and less in football, while Ron, [[Jared Rushton]], appears to be more straightforward and a [[Bullying|bully]] toward Nick, although he warms towards him. Rushton has quoted that he took the role after thinking that the script was \"appealing\" and he thought his character had progressed throughout the film with his personality.\n\n[[Amy O'Neill]] and [[Robert Oliveri]] were cast as Amy and Nick Szalinski, Wayne and Diane's kids. Oliveri commented that he was in awe about watching his stunt double do his stunts. He later starred as Kevin Boggs in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''. O'Neill thought the film was a fun experience and that doing off-set activities, such as swimming or playing cards, was fun to do with the other younger cast members. She accepted the role because it was a \"Disney movie.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | title=The Making of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Part 3 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grHP-67CkXM | year=1986 | via= [[YouTube]] | access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Direction===\nJohnston was selected to direct the film for his directorial debut, having been mostly working on films as an effects illustrator and art director. It was filmed at the backlot of [[Churubusco Studios]] in [[Mexico City]]. Gregg Fonseca<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284668/ Sometimes billed as \"Greg Fonseca\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217003145/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284668/ |date=2017-02-17 }}.</ref> was the production designer and was in charge of managing several different sets for the scenes in it.\n\nSome filming took place in the streets of Mexico City. In the scene where Diane walks out of the mall to the pay phone, a sign says \"Beverly Hills Mall\", but is in fact Plaza Inn a mall in Mexico City.\n\nSpecial effects were heavily used for the film, such as the electronically controlled ants and bees. For the most part, the production team tried to use practical effects that would work in camera. For the scene where Wayne lands in the Thompsons' pool, Moranis jumped off a flying board in the form of a [[Seesaw|teeter-totter]] on a swing set. A stuntman pushed the board, sending him flying through the air and landing on a mat.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy85AUFF9kE&NR=1|title=The Making of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Part 2|year=1986|access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> Numerous storyboards were used for the film, particularly in the sprinkler and bee scenes.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Scale models were also used for the bee scene, with miniature Russ Jr. and Nick plastic figures attached.

As the title suggests, Wayne succeeds in [[Enlargement (in fiction)|enlarging]] his two-year-old son, Adam, to gigantic proportions as one of his size-changing experiments goes awry.\n\n===Disney Parks attraction===\nA [[3D film|three-dimensional film]] called ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!]]'' complete with physical effects such as wind and water was created as an attraction at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] in 1994, and later made its way to [[Disneyland]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]] with all four parks featuring the attraction by 1999. The film was a replacement for the [[Michael Jackson]] film ''[[Captain EO]]'', a musical film  launched in 1986.\n\nThe film begins as a mock award show by \"The Imagination Institute\" that is intended to honor Wayne as \"Inventor of the Year.\" Instead, the audience is \"shrunk\" and threatened by Quark, Gigabyte (Nick's pet [[Pythonidae|python]]), Diane, and even Adam, among other thrills. It reprises most of the original cast and adds [[Eric Idle]] as the host of the award show.\n\n''Honey, I Shrunk the Audience'' was removed from all four Disney parks over the course of 2010. Disney elected to return ''[[Captain EO]]'' to all four parks to honor Michael Jackson following his death in 2009.\n\n===''Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves''===\nIn 1997, Disney produced the second sequel, ''[[Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves]]'', as a direct to video release. [[Rick Moranis]] was the only actor to reprise his role. The characters of Diane and Adam were recast, with Amy and Nick only being briefly mentioned in passing. Many new characters were added, including Wayne's brother Gordon and his family. This time, the parents are shrunk and need to be rescued by their kids.\n\n===TV series===\nThe last incarnation of the franchise was the television program ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show]]''.
