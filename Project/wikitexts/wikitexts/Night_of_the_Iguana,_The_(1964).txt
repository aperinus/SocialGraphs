Retrieved April 30, 2013.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''The Night of the Iguana''''' is a 1964 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[John Huston]], based on the 1961 [[The Night of the Iguana|play of the same name]] by [[Tennessee Williams]]. It stars [[Richard Burton]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Sue Lyon]].\n\nThe film won the 1964 [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], and was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. Actress [[Grayson Hall]] received an Academy Award and Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and [[Cyril Delevanti]] received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> In addition to Delevanti's nomination at the Golden Globes, [[Ava Gardner]] also received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] nomination. Both the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|picture]] and its [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Director]], [[John Huston]], likewise received Golden Globe nominations.\n\n''The Night of the Iguana'' drew considerable attention for its on-set drama because Burton would bring his soon-to-be-wife [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to the location set.<ref name=\"Alpert\">{{ cite book | first = Hollis | last = Alpert | title = Burton | url = https://archive.org/details/burton00alpe | url-access = registration | publisher = G.

Lawrence Shannon having a \"nervous breakdown\" after being ostracized by his congregation and [[defrocking|defrocked]] for having an inappropriate relationship with a \"very young [[Sunday school]] teacher.\"\n\nTwo years later, Shannon, now a tour guide for the bottom-of-the-barrel Texas company Blake's Tours, is taking a group of [[Baptists|Baptist]] schoolteachers by bus to [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Mexico]]. The group's brittle leader is Miss Judith Fellowes, whose 16-year-old niece Charlotte Goodall tries to seduce Shannon. Meanwhile, Fellowes accuses Shannon of trying to seduce Charlotte and declares that she will ruin him.\n\nWhile approaching the group's hotel in the bus, Shannon suddenly veers off and recklessly drives the terrified passengers to a cheap Costa Verde hotel in [[Mismaloya]]. Shannon assumes that the hotel is run by an old friend named Fred, but the man had died recently and the hotel is now run by Fred's widow, the bawdy and flamboyant Maxine Faulk. Shannon convinces Maxine to allow the tour group to stay at the hotel, believing that they will be unable to reach a phone or escape.\n\nAnother new arrival at the hotel is Hannah Jelkes, a beautiful and chaste itinerant painter from [[Nantucket]] who is traveling with her elderly poet grandfather. They have run out of money, but Shannon convinces Maxine to let them have a room. Over a long night, Shannon battles his weaknesses for both flesh and alcohol, Miss Fellowes' niece continues to make trouble for him and he is \"at the end of his rope,\" similar to how an [[iguana]] is kept tied by Maxine's cabana boys. Shannon suffers a breakdown, the cabana boys truss him in a hammock and Hannah ministers to him there with poppy-seed tea and frank spiritual counsel.\n\nHannah's grandfather delivers the final version of the poem that he has been laboring to finish and then dies. The characters try to resolve their confused lives, with Shannon and Maxine deciding to run the hotel together. Hannah walks away from her last chance at love.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Burton]] as the Reverend Dr. T.

At least, it has difficulty in communicating precisely what it is that is so barren and poignant about the people it brings to a tourist hotel run by a sensual American woman on the west coast of Mexico. And because it does have difficulty\u2014because it doesn't really make you see what is so helpless and hopeless about them\u2014it fails to generate the sympathy and the personal compassion that might make their suffering meaningful.<ref name=\"nyt64\">{{cite web| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE6D7103FEE32A25752C0A9619C946591D6CF | title= 'Night of the Iguana' Has World Premiere | first= Bosley | last=Crowther | author-link= Bosley Crowther | date= July 1, 1964| work= [[The New York Times]] | access-date= 2010-10-08}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCrowther was particularly critical of Burton's performance: \"Mr. Burton is spectacularly gross, a figure of wild disarrangement, but without a shred of real sincerity. You see a pot-bellied scarecrow flapping erratically. And in his ridiculous early fumbling with the [[Lolita]]ish Sue Lyon (whose acting is painfully awkward), he is farcical when he isn't grotesque.\"<ref name=\"nyt64\" />\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
