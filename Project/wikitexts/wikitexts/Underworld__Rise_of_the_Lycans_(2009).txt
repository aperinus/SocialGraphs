It is the third (chronologically, the first) installment in the [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 2003 film ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]''. The film focuses primarily on the origins of the characters and the events that lead up to the Vampire\u2013[[Werewolf|Lycan]] war. [[Kate Beckinsale]], who starred in the previous ''Underworld'' movies, appears briefly at the end of the movie.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo decades have passed since a war began between a legion of vampires and the first clan of werewolves, a breed unable to take human form. [[List of Underworld characters#Lucian|Lucian]] is the first werewolf born capable of taking human form and the first to be called a Lycan. [[List of Underworld characters#Viktor|Viktor]], a vampire elder, raises the child, envisioning a race of Lycan slaves guarding the coven's fortress during the day and working as laborers for the vampires at night. The countryside is filled with savage werewolves born from [[List of Underworld characters#William Corvinus|William]]'s rampage, and human nobles beg Viktor for protection against the beasts: he grants it in exchange for tributes of silver, which enables him to keep his slaves under control. As Lucian grows up, he and Viktor's daughter [[List of Underworld characters#Sonja|Sonja]] fall in love, and in their adult years they begin a secretive intimate relationship. Sonja is reckless and insubordinate, and one night Lucian escapes the shackles preventing him from turning werewolf and rescues Sonja from his werewolf brethren. Despite acknowledging that Lucian rescued his daughter, Viktor cannot forgive the escape and has Lucian whipped and imprisoned.\n\nBy trading her seat on the vampire council, Sonja enlists the help of [[List of Underworld characters#Andreas Tanis|Andreas Tanis]] in orchestrating Lucian's release. Lucian, unable to flee alone, liberates the other Lycans as he escapes. Sonja remains, planning to meet Lucian in three days. As she prepares to leave she is visited by her father. Viktor asks if she assisted in Lucian's escape: she denies it, but he discovers the truth by biting her neck and reading her memories through her blood. Discovering her relationship with Lucian, he imprisons her. Lucian recruits both human slaves and werewolves to build a force against the vampires. In the fortress, the vampire council and nobles demand that Viktor recapture Lucian, as his Lycans have been attacking human estates, freeing their slaves and offering them immortality as Lycans themselves. Viktor replies that he is confident Lucian will return as he has something Lucian wants: Sonja.\n\nLucian learns about Sonja's imprisonment and rescues her from her room, but they are stopped from escaping by Viktor. Sonja, hoping to spare Lucian's life, reveals to Viktor that she is pregnant with Lucian's child. Disgusted, Viktor overpowers her and imprisons both her and Lucian. Sonja is unanimously sentenced to death by the council at a trial presided over by her father, and is executed by exposure to sunlight in Lucian's presence.\n\nAn enraged and heartbroken Lucian turns werewolf, but his attempt to escape the fortress is thwarted by the [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealers]]. He is able to communicate with and control the wild werewolves, however, and summons them to storm the fortress. A melee ensues in which vampire council members, their aides and lesser vampire nobles are killed. Realizing that Viktor intends to flee, Lucian pursues him and they fight. Lucian traps Viktor by exposing him to shafts of sunlight and then stabs him through the mouth with a sword and pushes his body down into a nearby body of water. With the battle over, Lucian's deputy Raze declares that \"it is finished\", but Lucian knows this victory is only the beginning of what will become a war between the races. On a vampire ship fleeing the fortress, Viktor is revealed to have survived his wound and is sealed in an elder hibernation chamber by Tanis.\n\nThe opening scene of [[Underworld (2003 film)|the first ''Underworld'' film]] is then shown with the voice of vampire [[List of Underworld characters#Kraven|Kraven]] revealing to [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] that it was Viktor who killed her family, not the Lycans. Kraven adds that Viktor spared Selene's life because she reminded him of his executed daughter Sonja. Selene, unaware of the truth, dismisses Kraven's statement as \"lies\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as [[Underworld (film series)#Lucian|Lucian]]\n** Alexander Carroll as Young Lucian\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Viktor\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Sonja\n** Olivia Taylforth as Young Sonja\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Andreas Tanis\n* [[Kevin Grevioux]] as Raze\n* [[David Aston]] as Coloman\n* [[Elizabeth Hawthorne]] as Orsova\n* [[Craig Parker]] as Sabas\n* Larry Rew as Kosta\n* [[Jared Turner]] as Xristo\n* Timothy Raby as Janosh\n* [[Tania Nolan]] as Luka\n* [[Geraldine Brophy]] as Nobleman's Wife\n* Leighton Cardno as Fearful Lycan\n* Jason Hood as Death Dealer\n* Mark Mitchinson as Nobleman\n* Peter Tait as Gyorg\n* Eleanor Williams as Teenage Girl\n* Edwin Wright as Death Dealer Captain\n* [[Brian Steele]] as Big Lycan\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] (cameo role)\n* [[Shane Brolly]] as Kraven (archive audio)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2003, shortly after the release of ''Underworld'', production companies [[Screen Gems]] and Lakeshore planned to release a prequel as the third film following ''Underworld''{{'}}s sequel, ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' (2006).

Wiseman said, \"We sort of mapped out an entire history and story... a massive collection of ideas and stories that we're putting out at certain times.\" Wiseman anticipated creating a third installment for the franchise based on the audience's reception of ''Underworld: Evolution'', which would be released the following month.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue451/news.html | title=Wiseman Looking To ''Underworld 3'' | publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] | date=2005-12-12 | access-date=2006-10-30 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017041806/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue451/news.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-10-17}}</ref>\n\nIn a June 2006 interview, Wiseman said, \"The third film is going to be a prequel. It will be the origin story and we find out things we didn't know about Lucian; he'll have a much bigger part in it. It will be about the creation [of the races] and what started the war. It will be a period piece. The movie will also focus for the first time through the Lycans' point of view.\" The director also shared, \"In terms of the writing, a lot of the writing has been done. We've been developing ''Underworld 3'' for a while. I won't be directing ''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans''; I'm just going to be producing and writing.\" When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel, Wiseman said, \"It will be in the time period before, but it will overlap into the creation of her as well. We're in the process of seeing how far we go with that.\"<ref name=\"if\">{{cite news | first=Sean | last=Elliott | url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=3038 | title=Exclusive Interview: Underworld Director Len Wiseman Talks Die Hard 4 & Underworld 3 | publisher=iFMagazine.com | date=2006-06-06 | access-date=2006-10-30 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024005330/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=3038 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2006-10-24}}</ref> The following October, actor Michael Sheen, who portrays Lucian in the film series, expressed interest in being part of the prequel.<ref>{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/indietopnews.php?id=17065 | title=Exclusive: Michael Sheen of ''The Queen'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=2006-10-20 | access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512205039/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/indietopnews.php?id=17065 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans'' was distributed to 2,942 theatres on its opening day (23 January 2009) in the United States and grossed an estimated US$8,050,000, debuting at number 1 at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/daily/chart/?sortdate=2009-01-23&p=.htm | title=Daily Box Office for Friday January 23, 2009 |access-date=29 January 2009 |work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> On its opening weekend, the film was ranked second at the box office behind ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' with $20.7 million, which is lower than the amount earned by ''Underworld'' and ''Underworld: Evolution'' ($21.8 million and $26.9 million respectively) on their opening weekends. 59% of the audience at the premiere was male, while 55% was over 25 years old.<ref name=\"Variety-USBO-2009jan25\"/> Overall, the limited day-and-date launch of ''Rise of the Lycans'' in the week ending 23 January 2009 accumulated $3.5 million in two dozen markets outside the US, at 455 theatres, a third of which was earned at the Australian box office.<ref name=\"Variety-IntBO-2009jan25\">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=McNary |title='Valkyrie' tops foreign box office |url=https://www.variety.com/VR1117999034.html |work=Variety |date=25 January 2009 |access-date=29 January 2009}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the film was distributed to 339 theatres and obtained $1.4 million at the box office on its opening day, ranking as the second-best opener of the week behind ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]''.<ref name=\"Variety-EurBO-2009jan27\">{{cite news |first=Archie |last=Thomas |title='Valkyrie' steps out in Europe |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117999124.html |work=Variety |date=27 January 2009 |access-date=29 January 2009}}</ref> As of 26 April 2009, the film has grossed an estimated $45,802,315 in North America and $92,100,370 at the box office worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans'' received mostly mixed reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/underworld3 |title=Underworld: Rise of the Lycans |access-date=4 February 2009 |work=Metacritic}}</ref> According to the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], as of January 2012, 29% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 76 reviews.
