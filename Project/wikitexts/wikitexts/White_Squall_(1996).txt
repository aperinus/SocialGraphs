It is a [[coming of age]] film in which a group of high school and college-aged teenagers sign up for several months of training aboard a sail ship, a [[brigantine]], and travel around half the globe when suddenly they are challenged by a severe storm. The film stars [[Jeff Bridges]] in the role of the captain, called \"Skipper\", his wife, played by [[Caroline Goodall]], and a supporting cast portraying a group of nearly a dozen student sailors.\n\nThe film was based on the 1962 book ''The Last Voyage of the Albatross'' by Charles Gieg Jr. and Felix Sutton.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film is based on the fate of the [[brigantine]] ''[[Albatross (1920 schooner)|Albatross]]'', which sank 2&nbsp;May 1961, allegedly because of a [[white squall]]. The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call \"Skipper\". He is tough and teaches them discipline. He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg ([[Scott Wolf]]), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), shy Gil Martin ([[Ryan Phillippe]]) and bad-boy Dean Preston ([[Eric Michael Cole]]). On the first days, it is discovered that Gil suffers from [[acrophobia]] and does not even try to rescue Chuck, who nearly chokes to death when he becomes entangled in some rigging after slipping from one of the masts. After Chuck is saved by Skipper Sheldon, Gil is ordered to climb the ropes, which he ultimately cannot do, and is assigned to alternative limited duty while on board.\n\nFrank's snobby attitude causes him to bump heads with most of the boys, especially Dean, while Gil opens up to Chuck about his troubled home life one night in their bunks, which Frank listens to and identifies with as well.\n\nAfter many misadventures on land and on the boat, the boys begin to take Skipper's teachings seriously and begin acting like real shipmates, with Chuck, Frank, Gil and Dean becoming strong friends.\n\nEventually, the brigantine puts into shore and the boys take their leave on the island. Frank's wealthy father and mother give him a surprise visit while the crew is in port. Frank is upset that the visit seems poorly timed by his overbearing parents, and he becomes separated from the boys and their festivities when his parents require him to go out to steak dinner with them. The father and son end up in a fist fight and become further estranged by the visit and the fight. Frank gets drunk and comes to the party and has to be escorted out by Chuck, Gil and Dean.\n\nAfter a night of festivities, the crew set out to sea again on the next day. When the brigantine encounters a school of dolphins, Frank, still angry at his father, vents his fury by shooting one of the dolphins with a harpoon. Skipper demands Frank at least put the animal out of its misery, but he can't bring himself to, so Skipper kills it, then tells Frank he's been expelled from the program and puts him ashore at the next port. The day he leaves, Frank apologizes to Skipper for the incident on the boat and is given a farewell by Gil, who gets the courage to climb up the ropes to ring the bell for Frank, which symbolizes \u2018Where we go one, we go all\u2019.\n\nSoon after, while at sea, the brigantine encounters a freakish white squall storm. The vessel is battered by the seas, and the boys try to use what the Skipper has taught them in order to survive the horrific ordeal. Most of them succeed in abandoning the vessel, but Gil, Dean, Skipper's wife, and the cook George Ptacnik, all drown.\n\nWhen the survivors are rescued and reach land, Skipper is put on trial, with Frank's powerful parents leading the call for his license to be revoked. Eventually, the Skipper refuses to allow anyone else to be blamed for the disaster, and accepts responsibility, but his former students all stand up for him, and Frank turns against his bullying parents to support the Skipper, as all of the boys embrace him. The end credits explain that in reality six people died in total (four students) and dedicates the film to them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Captain Christopher \"Skipper\" Sheldon\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Alice Sheldon\n* [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as McCrea\n* [[Scott Wolf]] as Chuck Gieg\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Frank Beaumont\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Gil Martin\n* [[Eric Michael Cole]] as Dean Preston\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Girard Pascal\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Tod Johnstone\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Shay Jennings\n* [[David Lascher]] as Robert March\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Tracy Lapchick\n* [[David Selby]] as Francis Beaumont\n* [[Jordan Clarke (actor)|Jordan Clarke]] as Charles Gieg, Sr.\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Capt.

The site's consensus states: \"Though it gets occasionally bogged down by touchy-feely sentiment, ''White Squall'' benefits greatly from Jeff Bridges' assured lead performance and Ridley Scott's visceral, exciting direction\".<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_squall/ ''White Squall''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref> ''White Squall'', like Scott's previous film, ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]].\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave it three stars.

When the film was first issued on home entertainment formats, [[VHS]] was the current standard. Soon after [[DVD]] began to gain popularity and ''White Squall'' was issued, in North America, via [[Largo Entertainment]], and in the UK and Europe through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] DVD.\nFor [[Blu-ray]] releases ''White Squall'' has been issued as Region-Locked Region 2 in mainlane Europe only, Region 4 in Australia and New Zealand and Region 1 via [[Kino Lorber]] in America. A UK pressing has never been available.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0118158|White Squall}}\n* {{amg movie|135527|White Squall}}\n\n{{Ridley Scott}}\n\n[[Category:1996 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s disaster films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Disaster films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about animal cruelty]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Films about survivors of seafaring accidents or incidents]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Coast Guard]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ridley Scott]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jeff Rona]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1961]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Films set in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Savannah, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Largo Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Sailing films]]\n[[Category:Scott Free Productions films]]\n[[Category:Sea adventure films]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
