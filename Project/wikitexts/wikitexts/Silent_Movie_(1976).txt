The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Marty Feldman]], [[Bernadette Peters]], and [[Sid Caesar]], with cameos by [[Anne Bancroft]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[James Caan]], [[Marcel Marceau]], and [[Paul Newman]] as themselves. The film is produced in the manner of a 20th-century [[silent film]] with [[intertitle]]s instead of spoken dialogue (hence the name); the soundtrack consists almost entirely of accompanying music and [[sound effect]]s. It is an affectionate parody of slapstick comedies, including those of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Buster Keaton]]. The film satirizes the film industry, presenting the story of a film producer trying to obtain studio support to make a silent film in the then-present 1970s.\n\n==Plot==\nMel Funn ([[Mel Brooks]]), a once-great Hollywood film director, is now recovering from a drinking problem and down on his luck. He and his sidekicks Dom Bell ([[Dom DeLuise]]) and Marty Eggs ([[Marty Feldman]]) pitch to Big Pictures Studios' Chief ([[Sid Caesar]]) the idea to make the first silent movie in forty years. The Chief rejects the idea at first, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood's biggest stars to be in the film, it could save the studio from a takeover by New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour ([[Harold Gould]] and [[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]).\n\nFunn, Bell, and Eggs proceed to recruit various stars for the film. They surprise [[Burt Reynolds]] in his shower and then revisit his mansion in disguise. They recruit [[James Caan]] filming on location, following slapstick fumbling in an unstable dressing room trailer. They find [[Liza Minnelli]] at the studio commissary, where she eagerly agrees to be in the film. They recruit [[Anne Bancroft]] by disguising themselves as nightclub [[Flamenco]] dancers. While visiting the ailing Chief in the hospital, Funn phones mime artist [[Marcel Marceau]], who responds in French with his only spoken word in the film: a resounding \"''Non!''\" They see [[Paul Newman]] on the hospital grounds and sign him to the film after a wild electric wheelchair chase.\n\nIn the course of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief misadventures, including a mix-up between a [[seeing-eye dog]] and an untrained look-alike, several (mostly unsuccessful) efforts by Eggs to seduce various women, and a soft-drink dispensing machine that launches cans like grenades.\n\nEngulf and Devour learn of the project, and try to sabotage it by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan ([[Bernadette Peters]]) to seduce Funn. He falls for her, but returns to drinking when he learns she was part of a scheme. He buys a huge bottle of liquor and drinks himself into a stupor, surrounded by fellow \"winos\". But Kaplan has genuinely fallen for Funn and refused Engulf & Devour's money; she helps Bell and Eggs find him and restore him to sobriety.\n\nThe film is completed, but the only copy is stolen by Engulf & Devour just before its theatrical premiere. Kaplan stalls the audience with her nightclub act while Funn, Eggs, and Bell successfully steal the film back. They are cornered by Engulf and Devour's thuggish executives, but use the exploding soft-drink machine they encountered earlier to attack and subdue them. Lacking a separate spool to rewind the film, Eggs winds the film around his own body and upon returning to the theater he has to be rushed to the projection booth to show it.\n\nThe film is a huge success with the audience, which erupts with over-the-top applause. The studio is saved, and Funn, Bell, Eggs, Kaplan, and Chief celebrate, as an on-screen caption identifies the film as a \"true story\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Mel Funn\n* [[Marty Feldman]] as Marty Eggs\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Dom Bell\n* [[Bernadette Peters]] as Vilma Kaplan\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Studio Chief\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Himself\n* [[James Caan]] as Himself\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Herself\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Herself\n* [[Marcel Marceau]] as Himself\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Himself\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Engulf\n* [[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]] as Devour\n* [[Carol Arthur]] as Pregnant Lady\n* [[Liam Dunn]] as Newsvendor\n* [[Fritz Feld]] as Maitre d'\n* [[Chuck McCann]] as Studio Gate Guard\n* [[Valerie Curtin]] as Intensive Care Nurse\n* [[Yvonne Wilder]] as Studio Chief's Secretary\n* [[Arnold Soboloff]] as Acupuncture Man\n* [[Patrick Campbell (actor)|Patrick Campbell]] as Motel Bellhop\n* [[Harold Ritz|Harry Ritz]] as Man in Tailor Shop\n* [[Charlie Callas]] as Blindman\n* [[Henny Youngman]] as Fly-in-soup Man\n* [[Eddie Ryder]] as British Officer\n* [[Al Hopson]] as Executive\n* [[Rudy De Luca]] as Executive\n* [[Barry Levinson]] as Executive\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Executive\n* [[Lee Delano]] as Executive\n* [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] as Executive\n* [[Inga Neilsen]] as Beautiful Blonde #1\n* [[Erica Hagen]] as Beautiful Blonde #2\n* [[Robert Lussier]] as Projectionist\n* [[Phil Leeds]] as Rio Bomba Waiter (Uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Analysis==\n[[Mel Brooks]] enjoyed success with the release of ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' in 1974, both being [[parody film]]s spoofing entire genres. He followed this success with ''Silent Movie'', an affectionate parody of the [[slapstick film]]s of the [[silent film]] era. The film feels like a throwback to this earlier era, despite using [[Color motion picture film|color]] and other up to date techniques.<ref name=\"Crick\">Crick (2002), pp. 84\u2013100</ref> As a film about filmmaking, ''Silent Movie'' also parodies \"Hollywood deal-making\".<ref name=\"Crick\" /> Co-writer [[Ron Clark (writer)|Ron Clark]] was previously the producer of ''[[The Tim Conway Comedy Hour]]'' (1970), while [[Rudy De Luca]] and [[Barry Levinson]] were writers for ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978). Unsurprisingly, the humor of ''Silent Movie'' would not be out of place in a [[sketch comedy]].<ref name=\"Crick\" /> Henry Jenkins points out that for Brooks the decision to make a silent comedy represents an allusion to an earlier era of his career. He used to be a writer for ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' (1950\u20131954), a show which included [[pantomime]] segments and parodies of silent films. Television audiences of the 1950s were familiar with the silents through their broadcast on [[Late night television in the United States|late night television]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins (2013), pp. 165\u2013168</ref>\n\nThe film features an unflattering portrayal of the film industry. Big Picture Studios' front gate sign boasts of the multimillion-dollar scope of their films, never mentioning their quality. The film project is green-lit not on the merits of its script, but solely on the drawing power of the movie stars attached. Executives cannot tell good film footage apart from bad, while the 'Current Studio Chief' is one [[box office bomb]] away from losing his position. The studio itself is under threat of a takeover by a \"soulless\" [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The movie stars are portrayed as vain figures who flaunt their wealth. The moviegoing audience is portrayed as fickle and unpredictable.<ref name=\"Crick\" /> Villainous 'Engulf & Devour' is a parody of real-life conglomerate [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western Industries]], which had acquired [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"Crick\" /> The film also parodies corporate executives as essentially interchangeable yes-men, following the whims of their boss.<ref name=\"Crick\" />\n\nThe logo of Big Picture Studios is a parody of the [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|MGM lion]]. It depicts the Studio Chief ([[Sid Caesar]]) as a braying donkey.<ref name=\"Crick\" /> [[Liza Minnelli]] appears in a scene which makes no use of her dancing talents. Writer Robert Alan Crick, author of ''The Big Screen Comedies of Mel Brooks'' (2002), points out that the part could easily have been played by any well-known actress of the 1970s, with no apparent difference.<ref name=\"Crick\" /> The film was the first notable acting role for Brooks, who was previously limited to off-screen voiceovers and short cameos.<ref name=\"Crick\" />\n\nSound is a big factor in the film's humor, as when a scene that shows the New York City skyline begins with the song \"[[Theme from San Francisco|San Francisco]]\", only to have it come to a sudden stop as if the musicians realize they are playing the wrong music. They then go into \"[[Manhattan (song)|I'll Take Manhattan]]\" instead. One joke makes use of the difference between the expressive gestures of silent cinema and those used in [[guessing game]]s, such as [[charades]]. A secretary attempts to explain to the Studio Chief that Funn has a drinking problem, by pantomiming an uplifted bottle. Her boss misunderstands, figuring that Funn sucks his thumb.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Another scene with the Studio Chief pays homage to [[slapstick]]: the Chief proclaims slapstick to be dead, then his chair flips backwards, and sends him sliding across the room in it. He slams his head, with the sound of a bell ringing. The humor of the scene derives from the combination of the image and the unlikely sound.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> Many of the gags of the film actually depend on careful synchronizations of sound and image. For example, one sequence has Feldman tossed about between elevator doors. It is set to the sounds of a [[pinball]] machine.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\nOther gags are delivered through [[intertitle]]s. For example, in a meeting of 'Engulf & Devour', an underling whispers something in the ears of his boss. The intertitles report: \"whisper...whisper...whisper\". The boss fails to understand, forcing the man to shout. In response the intertitle is written in all caps: \"YOUR FLY IS OPEN\".<ref name=\"Jenkins\" />\n\n[[Marcel Marceau]] reprises his \"walking into the wind\" routine while trying to lift a phone. He then shouts his only spoken word of the film: \"''Non!''\".<ref name=\"Jenkins\" /> When the Studio Chief asks what was his answer, Mel Funn cowardly replies that he doesn't understand French.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The critical consensus reads: \"Stylistically audacious and infectiously nostalgic for the dawn of cinema, ''Silent Movie'' is another comedic triumph for Mel Brooks... now shush.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|silent_movie|Silent Movie}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Silent Movie |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-movie |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a four-star review and called it \"not only funny, but fun.\" He cited as positive elements the ability of Brooks to do anything for a laugh and the world of his films where everything is possible. He stated that Brooks took \"a considerable stylistic risk\" which he managed to pull off \"triumphantly\". He considered the film equal in comedic ability to ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), superior to ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), and inferior to ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968).<ref>{{cite web |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |title= Silent Movie movie review & film summary (1976) |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/silent-movie-1976 |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref><ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert (2007), pp. 701\u2013702</ref> He also praised the film for offering an encyclopedia-worth of [[visual gag]]s, both old and new.<ref name=\"Ebert\" />  [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film can be enjoyed as \"a virtually uninterrupted series of smiles\" but \"doesn't contain a single moment that ever seriously threatens to split the sides.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (July 1, 1976). \"'Silent Movie' With Golden Subtitles\".
