It stars [[Rami Malek]], [[DJ Qualls]], and [[Kate Lyn Sheil]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2016. It was released on April 28, 2017, by Well Go USA Entertainment.\n\n== Plot ==\nAn eccentric mountain man is on the run from the authorities, surviving the winter by breaking into empty vacation homes in a remote community. Regularly calling into radio talk shows \u2014 where he has acquired the nickname \"Buster\" \u2014 to rant about [[Year 2000 problem|the impending inversion at the turn of the millennium]], he is haunted by visions of being lost at sea, and memories of his former life as a family man.\n\nBuster was once Jonah, a husband and father whose job as the night-shift concierge at a hotel took its toll on his psyche and, consequently, his marriage to Marty \u2014 until a chance encounter with conspiracy-obsessed drifter Brown changed the course of their lives forever. As the solitary present-day Buster drifts from house to house, eluding the local sheriff and law enforcement, the film portrays the events that fractured his life and left him alone on top of a snowy mountain, or in a small rowboat in the middle of an ocean, or both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rami Malek]] as Jon\u00e1s \"Jonah\" Cueyatl, a hotel concierge turned [[mountain man]] who acquires the nickname Buster\n* [[DJ Qualls]] as Brown, a computer engineer who self-identifies as \"the Last Free Man\"\n* [[Kate Lyn Sheil]] as Marty Cueyatl, Jonah's wife\n* Sukha Belle Potter as Roxy Cueyatl, Jonah and Marty's daughter\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Pauline, Marty's mother\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Deputy Winston\n* Mark Kelly as Oscar Cueyatl, Jonah's father\n* Teresa Yenque as Adelita Cueyatl, Jonah's mother\n* Bruce Bundy as Ranger Meg\n* Jared Larson as Dale\n* Sandra Ellis as Mrs. Bowery\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Mr. Bowery\n* [[Lily Gladstone]] as Kelly, the morning shift concierge at the hotel\n* [[Sandra Seacat]] as a public access psychic\n* [[Ross Partridge]] as the psychic caller\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nAfter producing her first feature film ''[[The Midnight Swim]],'' Smith knew that she wanted to create a story about a man and a mountain. She wrote the script at the Screenwriters Colony in [[Nantucket|Nantucket, MA]]. It was a non-traditional script, that combined illustrations with scene descriptions so that it almost read like a short story.\n\nWhile finding financing came surprisingly easily for such an unusual script, the biggest challenge was finding someone to cast as the lead. Originally planning to cast a Latino actor due to the bilingual nature of the main character Jonah, Smith widened the search to expedite the casting process, eventually deciding on Rami Malek who she had seen in ''[[Short Term 12]]'' and ''[[The Pacific (miniseries)|The Pacific]]''. A tarot-card reading confirmed her casting choice.<ref>{{cite web| work= FilmMaker| title=TIFF 2016: Five Questions for Buster\u2019s Mal Heart Writer/Director Sarah Adina Smith| author= Scott Macaulay | url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/99764-tiff-2016-five-questions-for-busters-mal-heart-writerdirector-sarah-adina-smith/}}</ref>\n\n''Buster's Mal Heart'' was filmed near [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] and in [[Kalispell, MT]], as well as on the ocean in open water. Originally, Smith planned to film in her home-state of Colorado but, in the end, decided to shoot in Montana for the available state grant as well as the unique and dramatic landscape.
