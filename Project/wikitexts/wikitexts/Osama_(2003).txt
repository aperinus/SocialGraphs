The film follows a preteen girl living in Afghanistan under the [[Taliban]] regime who disguises herself as a boy, Osama, to support her family. It was the first film to be shot entirely in Afghanistan since 1996, when the Taliban regime banned the creation of all films.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Verma|first=Priya|date=2006|title=Osama|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=36|issue=3|pages=46|issn=0030-0071|jstor=20838657}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last1=Basoli|first1=A.G.|last2=Barmak|first2=Siddiq|date=2004|title=Emerging from the Taliban's Grim Legacy: An Interview with Siddiq Barmak|journal=Cin\u00e9aste|volume=29|issue=3|pages=38\u201341|issn=0009-7004|jstor=41690254}}</ref> The film is an [[international co-production]] between companies in [[Cinema of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[Cinema of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], [[Cinema of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Cinema of Iran|Iran]].\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the title of the film highlights an [[Allegory|allegorical]] relevance to [[Osama bin Laden]], there is no further similarity. The film takes place during the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which is especially repressive for women.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Khwaja Nader -2006-07-12-.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Actor Khwaja Nader in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], July 2006.]]\nIn [[Taliban]]-ruled [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], women must wear [[burqa]]s to cover themselves and are banned from working outside the home. This causes difficulty for a family consisting of only an unnamed young girl, her mother, and her grandmother, whose male relatives were killed in battle during the [[Soviet invasion of Afganhistan|Soviet invasion]] and subsequent civil wars. The mother loses her hospital job when the Taliban cuts off funding, and cannot find other work.\n\nDesperate, the mother and grandmother decide [[Bacha posh|to have the young girl disguise herself as a boy]] so that she can get a job. To persuade the girl to accept the plan, the grandmother tells her an Afghan fable about a boy who became a girl when he went under a rainbow. The girl reluctantly agrees, despite being afraid that the Taliban will kill her if they discover her masquerade. They cut her hair, and the girl plants a lock of it in a flowerpot. The only other people who know of the ruse are the milk vendor, who gives her a job because he was a friend of her deceased father, and a local boy named Espandi who sees through her disguise. It is Espandi who renames the girl Osama.\n\nThe masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban draft all the local boys into their [[madrasa]], a religious and military training school for boys. They are taught how to fight and conduct ''[[ghusl]]'', ritual ablutions, including one for when they experience a [[nocturnal emission]] or, when they are older, have sex with their wives. Osama attempts to avoid joining the ablution session, and the schoolmaster grows suspicious of her. She realises that she will inevitably be found out. Several of the boys begin to pick on her. Espandi is able to protect her at first, but her secret is discovered when she begins to menstruate.\n\nOsama is arrested and put on trial along with two other people. The others are condemned and put to death, but as Osama is destitute and helpless, her life is spared; she is instead given in marriage to a much older man. He already has three wives, all of whom hate him and say he has destroyed their lives. The wives take pity on Osama, but are powerless to help her. The husband shows her the padlocks he uses on his wives' rooms, reserving the largest for her. The film ends with the new husband conducting an ablution in an outdoor bath, which the boys were earlier taught to conduct after ejaculation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marina Golbahari]] \u2013 Osama\n* Arif Herati \u2013 Espandi\n* Zubaida Sahar \u2013 Mom\n* [[Malik Akhlaqi]] \u2013 Sun osama\n* Gol Rahman Ghorbandi \u2013 Lady No. 1\n* Mohamad Haref Harat \u2013 Lady No. 2\n* Mohamad Nader Khadjeh \u2013 Lady No. 3\n* Khwaja Nader \u2013 Jadi\n* Hamida Refah \u2013 Rohmi\n\n==Production==\nSiddiq Barmak's inspiration was found in a news story he read while in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]]. The paper told the story of a girl who had dressed as a boy to attend school but was eventually discovered by the Taliban. Barmak would go on to add elements of other stories that were shared with him by people who had lived in [[Afghanistan]] under Taliban rule culminating with the story of the film.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_1769.jsp|title=Osama and Afghan cinema: an interview with Siddiq Barmak|website=Opendemocracy.net|url-status=dead|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624010915/https://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_1769.jsp|archive-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Kabul]]. Work began in June 2002 and was completed in March 2003 with a budget of approximately $46,000 [[United States dollar|US$]]. All the actors in the film are amateurs found by the director on the streets of Kabul.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tricityvoice.com/articledisplay.php?a=2211|title=Tri City Voice: Interview with Osama director, Siddiq Barmak by Christopher Cobb - February 17, 2004|website=Tricityvoice.com|access-date=23 June 2018}}</ref> Much of the dialogue was improvised by the actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/arts-Film/article_1769.jsp|title=Osama and Afghan cinema: an interview with Siddiq Barmak|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2004/04/film/osama|title=OUT-TAKES: The Power of Osama|website=The Brooklyn Rail|date=April 2004|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>\n\n''Osama'' was originally titled ''Rainbow'' and ended on a hopeful note, with Osama passing under a rainbow and gaining her freedom. As time went on, Barmak grew dissatisfied with the ending, describing it as unrealistic for [[post-war Afghanistan]]. He changed the ending and title to reflect his feeling that Afghan women were still not truly free at the time he made the film.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Osama'' was very well received by the Western cinematic world. It gathered a rating of 96% based on 100 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a website which tabulates the reviews from professional film critics into a single rating.<ref>{{cite web |title = ''Osama'' (2003) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/osama/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date = 14 July 2010 }}</ref> Writing for feminist magazine ''[[Off our backs]]'', [[Priya Verma]] described the film as \"gripping and unflinching.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> She worried that the film might seem unduly negative toward Islam, but concluded that Barmak's focus was the authoritarian control tactics employed by the Taliban against women contributed, rather than Islam in general.<ref name=\":0\" /> In ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', [[Bert Cardullo]] pointed out the film's intentional omission of any spoken female names, emphasizing the casual, unthinking oppression of females under the Taliban regime.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cardullo|first=Bert|date=2005|editor-last=Entertainment|title=An Afghan Is a Woman|journal=The Hudson Review|volume=58|issue=2|pages=306\u2013307|issn=0018-702X|jstor=30044778}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, grossing $3,888,902 worldwide from a [[Low-budget film|small budget]] of $46,000.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|osama|Osama}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n[[Bratislava International Film Festival]]\n* '''Awarded:''' Special Mention\n* '''Nominated:''' Grand Prix for F1\n\n[[Cannes Film Festival]]\n* '''Awarded:''' AFCAE Award\n* '''Awarded:''' Cannes Junior Award\n* '''Awarded:''' Golden Camera \u2013 Special Mention\n\n[[Cinemanila International Film Festival]]\n* '''Awarded:''' Best Actress \u2013 [[Marina Golbahari]]\n* '''Nominated:''' Lino Brocka Award\n\n[[Golden Globes]]\n* '''Awarded:''' Golden Globe Best Foreign Language Film \u2013 Afghanistan\n\n[[Golden Satellite Awards]]\n* '''Nominated:''' Golden Satellite Award Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language \u2013 Afghanistan\n\n[[Golden Trailer Awards]]\n* '''Won:''' Golden Trailer Best Foreign\n\n[[London Film Festival]]\n* '''Won:''' Sutherland Trophy\n\n[[Molodist International Film Festival]]\n* '''Won:''' Best Film Award Best Full \u2013 Length Fiction Film\n* '''Won:''' Best Young Actor Award \u2013 [[Marina Golbahari]]\n\n[[Busan International Film Festival]]\n* '''Won:''' New Currents Award \u2013 Special Mention \n* '''Won:''' PSB Audience Award\n\n[[Valladolid International Film Festival]]\n* '''Won:''' Golden Spike\n\n[[Young Artist Awards]]\n* '''Nominated:''' Young Artist Award Best International Feature Film\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bacha posh]], the practice depicted in the film where a family without sons may pick a daughter to live as a boy\n* [[The Breadwinner (film)|The Breadwinner]], a 2017 film with a similar premise.\n* [[Cross-dressing in film and television]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0368913|Osama}}\n* {{mojo title|osama|Osama}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|osama|Osama}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Osama}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Osama''\n|list1=\n{{Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film 1990\u20132009}}\n{{Sutherland Trophy}}\n}}\n{{Afghan submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Osama}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]\n[[Category:Dutch drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish drama films]]\n[[Category:Iranian drama films]]\n[[Category:Dari-language films]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films set in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Dutch independent films]]\n[[Category:Works about the Taliban]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Afghan drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
