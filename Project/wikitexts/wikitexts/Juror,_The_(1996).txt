The film received highly negative reviews and Moore won a joint [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] for both her performance in this film and in ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAnnie Laird ([[Demi Moore]]) is a sculptor who lives in New York with her son Oliver ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]); she works a day job as a [[data entry clerk]]. Annie is selected to be a juror in the trial of mafia boss Louie Boffano ([[Tony Lo Bianco]]), who is accused of ordering the murder of Salvatore Riggio.\n\nMark Cordell ([[Alec Baldwin]]) buys some of Annie's artwork and then wines and dines her before she discovers he is better known as \"The Teacher\", Boffano's enforcer and the actual perpetrator of Riggio's murder. Mark tells Annie to persuade the jury to acquit Boffano, or she and Oliver will die.\n\nA frightened Annie convinces the jury to acquit Boffano. After the trial, Boffano questions whether Annie should \"disappear\", seeing her as a loose end. Mark convinces Boffano otherwise. Mark goes after Annie's friend Juliet ([[Anne Heche]]). After having sex with her, Mark reveals himself to be Annie's stalker. He pulls a gun and forces Juliet to take a fatal drug overdose. Mark boasts of Juliet's murder to Eddie ([[James Gandolfini]]), who also works for Boffano but unlike Mark, is sympathetic to Annie as he is a parent himself.\n\nTo ensure her son's safety, Annie hides Oliver in the village of T'ui Cuch, [[Guatemala]]. The prosecutor, who figured out Annie was threatened, wants Annie to [[turn state's evidence|turn state's witness]] so they can go after Mark, who now plans to take over Boffano's empire.\n\nAnnie convinces the prosecutor to let her wear a wire in a scheduled meeting with Mark. Annie removes the wire and gives it to Eddie, insinuating she and Mark are now a couple. Annie then succeeds in getting Mark to incriminate himself in a boastful rant about his ambitions, which she tapes on a hidden tape recorder. She uses the tape to tip off Boffano, who schedules a meeting with Mark.\n\nBoffano's plan backfires when Mark kills both Boffano and his son Joseph ([[Michael Rispoli]]), along with their henchmen. He also slashes Eddie's throat. Mark, furious at Annie's betrayal, calls her, revealing his intention to travel to Guatemala to kill Oliver.\n\nAnnie travels to Guatemala where there is a showdown with Mark. He chases Oliver into a structure, where locals shoot Mark. Annie, also armed with a pistol, fires six more shots, making sure Mark is dead after he tries to shoot Annie with a gun pulled from his ankle holster. Oliver is unharmed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Annie Laird\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Vincent \"The Teacher\" / Mark Cordell\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Eddie\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Oliver Laird\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as US Attorney Tallow\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Juliet\n* [[Tony Lo Bianco]] as Louie Boffano\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Joseph Boffano\n* [[Matthew Cowles]] as Rodney\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Boone\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as DeCicco\n* [[Michael Constantine]] as Judge Weitzel\n* [[Polly Adams]] as Jury Forewoman\n* [[Jack Gilpin]] as Accountant, Juror\n* [[Chuck Cooper (actor)|Chuck Cooper]] as Stockbroker, Juror\n* Charle Landry as Musician, Juror\n* Tom Signorelli as Locksmith, Juror\n* [[Frances Foster]] as Housewife, Juror\n* Robin Moseley as Matron, Juror\n* [[Julie Halston]] as Inez\n* [[Todd Susman]] as Boezman\n* [[Rosemary De Angelis]] as Mrs. Riggio\n* [[Joe Perrino]] as Tommy Riggio\n* James McCauley as Carew\n* William Hill as Walters  \n* [[Chuck Zito]] as Frankie\n\n==Production==\nColumbia Pictures acquired the movie rights to the unpublished book for $1.5 million.
