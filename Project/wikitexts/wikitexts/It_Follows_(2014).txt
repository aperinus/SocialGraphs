After a successful [[limited release]] beginning on March 13, 2015, the film had a wide release on March 27, 2015. It received acclaim from critics; praise was directed at the film\u2019s originality and Monroe\u2019s performance.<ref name=rt/> It grossed $23.3 million worldwide against a $1.3 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA young woman named Annie flees from her house in fear, but there is no visible threat. She takes her parents' car and drives to the beach, where she tearfully tells her father over the phone that she loves him. At dawn, it is revealed that she has been brutally murdered.\n\nAfterwards, Jaime \"Jay\" Height goes on a date with her new boyfriend, Hugh, to the movies. Hugh points out a young girl in the back of the theater. When Jay says she cannot see the girl, Hugh becomes unnerved and asks that they leave. On another date, Hugh and Jay have sex in his car, but afterwards, he incapacitates Jay with [[chloroform]] and she wakes up tied to a wheelchair. Hugh explains that he has passed an entity on to her through intercourse. It will perpetually be walking towards Jay's location at all times, no matter where she is. If it catches Jay, it will kill her and pursue the previous person to have passed it on: Hugh, who is passing it to Jay as leverage. Hugh's claims are proven accurate when a naked woman appears and walks straight for Jay. Hugh drives Jay home and flees.\n\nThe next day, the police cannot find the naked woman or Hugh, who was living under a false identity. At school, Jay sees an old woman in a hospital gown walking towards her, invisible to others. Jay's sister, Kelly and her friends, Paul Bolduan and Yara Davis, agree to help and spend the night in Jay and Kelly's house. That night, someone smashes the kitchen window; Paul investigates but sees no one. Inside the house, Jay sees a disheveled, urinating, half-naked woman walking toward her and runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity. When a tall man enters the bedroom, Jay flees the house; her friends catch up to her at a nearby playground.\n\nWith the help of their neighbor, Greg Hannigan, the group discovers Hugh's real name \u2013 Jeff Redmond \u2013 and traces him to his address. Jeff's mother answers the door and Jay realizes that the naked woman she had seen coming for her in the Packard Plant was in the form of Mrs. Redmond. Jeff explains that the entity began pursuing him after a one-night stand and that Jay can pass it on by having sex with someone else. Greg drives Jay, Kelly, Yara, and Paul to his family's lake house and teaches Jay to shoot a revolver. The entity arrives in the form of Yara and attacks Jay on the lakefront. Jay's friends ward it off by breaking a chair over its body and Jay shoots it several times until it falls over, but it recovers unharmed and attacks Jay again, this time taking the form of a boy who lives next door to Jay. She flees in Greg's car, crashes into a cornfield and wakes up in a hospital with a broken arm. Greg has sex with Jay in the hospital, as he does not believe the entity exists.\n\nDays later, Jay sees the entity in the form of Greg walking towards Greg's house, smashing a window at Greg's house and entering. Jay tries to warn the real Greg by telephone, but he does not answer. She runs into the house and finds the entity in the form of Greg's half-naked mother knocking on his door. It stares at Jay for a few moments before continuing to knock. Not hearing Jay's pleas, Greg opens the door and the entity pounces on him. Jay sees the entity having sex with a dead Greg, then flees by car and spends the night outdoors. On a beach, Jay sees three young men on a boat. She then undresses and walks into the water, though it is unclear if she does anything with them. Back home, Paul, willing to take the risk, offers Jay the opportunity to pass it on to him, but she refuses.\n\nThe group plans to kill the entity by luring it into a swimming pool and dropping electrical appliances into the water. Jay, waiting in the pool, spots the entity and realizes it has taken the appearance of her deceased father. Instead of entering the pool, it throws the devices at her. Firing at an invisible target, Paul accidentally wounds Yara, but shoots the entity in the head. They then cover it with a sheet, and Paul shoots it once more, causing it to fall into the pool. As Jay tries to get out of the pool, it pulls her underwater by the ankle. Paul shoots it again in the head and it sinks to the bottom, allowing Jay to escape. She approaches the pool and sees no body, but a mist of blood. Jay and Paul have sex. That night, Paul drives through town, passing prostitutes. Later, Jay and Paul walk down the street holding hands, as a figure walks behind them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maika Monroe]] as Jaime \"Jay\" Height, a young woman targeted by the entity\n* [[Keir Gilchrist]] as Paul Bolduan, a friend of Jay, Kelly, and Yara\n* [[Olivia Luccardi]] as Yara Davis, Kelly's friend\n* Lili Sepe as Kelly Height, Jaime's sister\n* [[Daniel Zovatto]] as Greg Hannigan, Jay and Kelly's neighbor\n* [[Jake Weary]] as Hugh / Jeff Redmond, Jaime's former boyfriend and a target of the entity\n* Bailey Spry as Annie Marshall, one of the entity's victims\n* Debbie Williams as Mrs. Height, Jaime and Kelly's mother\n* Ruby Harris as Mrs. Redmond, Jeff's mother\n\nFeatured as forms of the entity are Ingrid Mortimer, Alexyss Spradlin, Mike Lanier, and Don Hails.
