The film closed the 2006 [[Venice Film Festival]], proved to be a moderate box-office success and won both the [[Nika Award]] and the [[Golden Eagle Award (China)|China TV Golden Eagle Award]] as the Best Russian film of 2006. The [[filming location]] was the city of [[Kem, Russia|Kem]], in [[Karelia]], on the shores of the [[White Sea]].<ref name=\"film-sermon\" /> It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring [[World War II]], the sailor Anatoly and his captain, Tikhon, are captured by the [[Germans]] when they board their barge and tugboat, which is carrying a shipment of coal. The German officer leading the raid offers Anatoly{{spnd}}who is terrified of dying{{spnd}}the choice to be shot or to shoot Tikhon and stay alive, which Anatoly takes; he shoots, and Tikhon falls overboard. The Germans blow up the ship but Anatoly is found by [[Russian Orthodox]] monks on the shore the next morning. He survives and becomes a [[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]] at the [[monastery]] but is perpetually overcome with guilt.\n\nThirty years pass. Anatoly now has the gifts of [[prophecy]] and healing. But the other monks do not really understand him. People come to see Anatoly for cures and guidance, but even now, he remains in a perpetual state of repentance. He often gets in a boat and goes to an uninhabited island where he prays for mercy and forgiveness and for Tikhon's soul.\n\nMany years pass, and an [[admiral]] of the North Fleet arrives at the monastery. He brings his daughter who is  [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a [[demon]], but Anatoly [[exorcism|exorcises]] it. The admiral turns out to be Tikhon. It is revealed that Anatoly only wounded him in the arm. Tikhon forgives Anatoly.\n\nAnatoly announces his death by Wednesday; the monks provide a coffin.  Dressed in a white garment such as [[Jesus]] wore or as an Orthodox baptismal garment, he lies in the coffin, wearing a [[crucifix]].  Monks, one carrying a large cross representing the risen Christ, are seen rowing the coffin away from the island.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Russia rabocheostrovsk ostrovs scenery belltower.jpg|Bell tower\nImage:Russia Rabocheostrovsk Ostrovs scenery barge.jpg|Barge\n</gallery>\n\n== Spiritual message ==\n\nThe film is focused on father Anatoly's repentance of his sin (therefore the virtually continuous occurrence of the [[Jesus Prayer]]); but the transgressions of the depicted character (a [[Foolishness for Christ|fool for Christ]]) and their impact on the others are the means by which the actual plot develops. The film's director [[Pavel Lungin]], speaking of the central character's self-awareness, said he doesn't regard him as being clever or spiritual, but blessed \"in the sense that he is an exposed nerve, which connects to the pains of this world. His absolute power is a reaction to the pain of those people who come to it;\" while \"typically, when the miracle happens, the lay people asking for a miracle are always dissatisfied\" because \"the world does not tolerate domestic miracles.\"\n\nScreenwriter Dmitry Sobolev further explains: \"When a person asks [[God]] for something, he is often wrong because God has a better understanding of what a person needs at that moment.\"<ref name=\"film-sermon\">[http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/164751.html \u00ab\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u00bb. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c-\u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c] (''\"The Island\" - Film-event.
