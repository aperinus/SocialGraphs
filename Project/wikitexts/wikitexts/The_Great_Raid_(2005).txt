It is directed by [[John Dahl]] and stars [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[James Franco]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Marton Csokas]], [[Joseph Fiennes]] with Motoki Kobayashi and [[Cesar Montano]]. The [[principal photography]] took place from July 4 to November 6, 2002, but its release was delayed several times from the original target of fall 2003. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]].\n\nThe film showcases the efforts of [[World War II|American soldiers]] and the [[Philippine resistance against Japan|Filipino resistance]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]], rescuing Allied prisoners of war from a Japanese POW camp.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1945, American forces were closing in on the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese-occupied Philippines]]. The [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]ese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the [[Bataan Death March]] in a notorious [[POW]] camp at [[Cabanatuan]] and subjected them to brutal treatment and [[summary execution]], as the Japanese code of [[bushido]] viewed surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with [[malaria]].\n\nThe film opens with the [[Palawan Massacre|massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan]] by the [[Kenpeitai|Kempeitai]], the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though it was committed by the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army]]).{{Citation needed|reason=citations are needed for this information. There are no citations in this paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n\nAt [[Lingayen Gulf]], the [[6th Ranger Battalion]] under Lieutenant-Colonel [[Henry Mucci]] is ordered by Lt. Gen. [[Walter Krueger]] to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, [[Alamo Scouts]] from the Sixth Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the [[Raid at Cabanatuan]].{{Citation needed|reason=citations are needed for this information. There are no citations in this paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n\nThroughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the [[Philippine resistance against Japan|Filipino resistance]] and the Japanese.{{Citation needed|reason=citations are needed for this information. There are no citations in this paragraph|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse [[Margaret Utinsky]], who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to [[Fort Santiago]] prison. She was eventually released but spent six weeks recovering from [[gangrene]] as a result of injuries sustained from beatings.{{Citation needed|reason=citations are needed for this information.

However, it received more praise from ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]], who gave it three stars.\n\nEbert praised the film, saying, \"Here is a war movie that understands how wars are actually fought.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/> He continued, \"[The film] has been made with the confidence that the story itself is the point, not the flashy graphics. The raid is outlined for the troops (and for the audience), so that, knowing what the rescuers want to do, we understand how they're trying to do it. Like soldiers on a march, it puts one step in front of another, instead of flying apart into a blizzard of quick cuts and special effects. Like the jazzier but equally realistic ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', it shows a situation that has moved beyond policy and strategy and amounts to soldiers in the field, hoping to hell they get home alive.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/> He also said the film gave \"full credit\" to the Filipino guerrillas who assisted the Rangers.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> He concluded, \"it is good to have a film that is not about entertainment for action fans, but about how wars are won with great difficulty, risk, and cost.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50803001|title=The Great Raid Movie Review & Film Summary (2005)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=27 August 2017|archive-date=25 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125145738/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50803001|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' criticized a lack of character development and the pace of the film, saying, \"On screen, at least, the raid to free the prisoners isn't all that great \u2013 just a bunch of explosions and combat maneuvers.

A great deal of effort has been made to achieve a level of anthropological correctness: The weapons are right, the uniforms are right, the equipment is right...The raid itself is a dynamo of action filmmaking, exactly like what the real thing must have been \u2013 swift and brutal, with a lot of shooting and no prisoner-taking.\"<ref name=\"WAPO\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081101994.html|title=Men With a Mission|first=Stephen|last=Hunter|date=12 August 2005|access-date=27 August 2017|website=Washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Joel Selvin]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the film \"very boring\"; a \"story without irony, perspective or any leavening that would make it something other than an ordinary military-action caper.

But director John Dahl (Joy Ride) and the screenwriters have conjured a dreary, old-fashioned 'last roundup' of war movie and prisoner-of-war movie cliches, small but forgivable sins.
