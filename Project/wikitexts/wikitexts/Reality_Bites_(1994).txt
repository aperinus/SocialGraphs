It stars [[Winona Ryder]], [[Ethan Hawke]] and Stiller, with supporting roles by [[Janeane Garofalo]] and [[Steve Zahn]]. The plot follows Lelaina (Ryder), an aspiring [[videography|videographer]] working on a documentary called ''Reality Bites'' about the disenchanted lives of her friends and roommates. Their challenges exemplify some of the career and lifestyle choices faced by [[Generation&nbsp;X]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $40.9 million worldwide against an $11.5 million budget. Critics highlighted the performances of Ryder, Hawke and Garofalo in particular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-02-18/entertainment/25860369_1_helen-childress-reality-bites-troy|title=A Generation X Quartet Sinks Its Teeth Into Life|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=March 27, 2013|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-10-17/entertainment/9910180191_1_lelaina-reality-bites-structure-of-reality|title='Reality' Is A Gen-x Film With Satirical Bite|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=October 17, 1999|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the years since the initial release of the film, it has achieved [[Cult film|cult status]] and has been singled out as one of the films that captured the zeitgeist of the early 1990s [[grunge]] scene among young adults, while also bringing attention to various issues that plagued young Americans at the time.\n\nA television series adaptation is being prepared at [[Peacock (streaming service)|Peacock]].\n\n==Plot==\nFour friends, recent college graduates, live together in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter years ago.\n\nTroy is floundering, having lost several minimum-wage jobs\u2014the last of which he loses for stealing a candy bar from his employer. Lelaina was valedictorian of her university and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially has to settle for a position as production assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.\n\nLelaina meets Michael Grates when throwing a lit cigarette into his [[convertible]] causes him to crash into her car. They soon begin to date. He works as an executive at an [[MTV]]-like channel called In Your Face, and after seeing a documentary she has been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.\n\nLelaina's roommate Vickie has a series of [[one-night stand]]s and short relationships with dozens of men; her promiscuity leads her to face a very real risk of contracting [[HIV]] after a former fling tests positive for the virus. Working as a sales associate for [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], Vickie is later promoted to manager and is content with her new job. Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains [[Celibacy|celibate]], not due to a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to [[Coming out|come out]] to his conservative parents.\n\nAfter an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates. Eventually, Vickie's HIV test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Lelaina's relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that compromises her artistic vision. Lelaina and Troy have a heart-to-heart which leads to them sleeping together and confessing their feelings. The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town. When Troy's father dies, it forces him to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.\n\nTroy and Lelaina reunite and make amends once he returns from his father's funeral in Chicago. While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, \"Elaina\" and \"Roy\", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship. As the \"show's\" credits roll, Michael's name is revealed as the creator, implying that he has turned the relationship between Lelaina and Troy into the subject of a new show on his network.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Lelaina Pierce\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Troy Dyer\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Michael Grates\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Vickie Miner\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Sammy Gray\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Charlane McGregor\n* Harry O'Reilly as Wes McGregor\n* [[Barry Del Sherman]] as Grant's producer\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Louise\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Rock\n* [[Keith David]] as Roger\n* [[David Pirner]] as Phineas\n* [[Evan Dando]] as Actor \"Roy\"\n* [[Karen Duffy]] as Actor \"Elaina\"\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Tom Pierce\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Grant Gubler\n}}\n\nIn addition to Garofalo, director Stiller gave cameos to [[Andy Dick]] (as a sleazy boss) and [[John F.

Stiller also cast fellow [[Saturday Night Live cast members|''Saturday Night Live'' alumnus]] [[David Spade]] in an uncredited appearance as the manager during Lelaina's job interview at [[Wienerschnitzel]]. Stiller's girlfriend [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] also makes an uncredited appearance, parodying [[Cindy Crawford]] and MTV's show ''[[House of Style]]''. [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] appears as Tami, a one-night stand of Troy's, in her first credited film role.
