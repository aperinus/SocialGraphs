Maggie's mother Lila ([[Wendy Crewson]]) and brother are forced to move into her loft sublet with her, but unaware that she is a [[lesbian]]. Maggie's freedom is compromised, and she believes she must keep her blossoming affair a secret. The clandestine romance introduces Maggie's family to a host of new experiences, many of which are \"better than chocolate\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> The story features Judy, a friend of Maggie's who is a [[transgender]] woman. Judy develops a friendship with Maggie's Mom and helps her to repair her relationship with her daughter. Judy's love interest is Frances, owner of the book shop in which Maggie works and purveyor of [[LGBT]] literature.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karyn Dwyer]] as Maggie\n* [[Christina Cox]] as Kim\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Judy\n* [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]] as Frances\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Lila, Maggie's Mom\n* Kevin Mundy as Paul, Maggie's Brother\n* [[Marya Delver]] as Carla\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Tony\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Mr. Marcus\n* Beatrice Zeilinger as Bernice\n* [[Veena Sood]] as Religious Zealot\n\n==Background ==\nThe film was created with a budget of $1.6 million.<ref name=\"Melnyk2004\" /> It was co-produced by Peggy Thompson and Sharon McGowan.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/437999587.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+13%2C+1999&author=Walker%2C+Susan&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=1&desc=Nothing+better+than+Chocolate+for+veteran+director+Wheeler \"Nothing better than Chocolate for veteran director Wheeler\"].

Veena Sood, the sister of McLachlan's then-husband [[Ashwin Sood]], has a small role in the film as a religious protester.\n\nThe plot line about the bookstore is a fairly direct reference to Vancouver's [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]] and its [[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)|travails]] with [[Canada Customs]].  The bookstore is thanked in the credits. Ann-Marie MacDonald, who plays the bookstore's owner, is a well-known Canadian author.\n\nThe movie poster, which shows two women embracing and one woman's naked back, was banned by the [[Hong Kong]] Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority as it was deemed \"offensive to public morality, decency and ordinary good taste.\"<ref>[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200003/30/0330206.htm Statement for the decision on a poster for a Category III film]</ref>  An advertisement in the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' was also removed, due to the word \"lesbian\" being present on the movie poster.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/torts-intentional-torts-libel-slander/6701688-1.html San Diego Union-Tribune Refuses to Run The Word 'Lesbian' in Advertising]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack of the film was released as a CD in 1999 on Lakeshore Records.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/better-than-chocolate-mw0000256186 \"Original Soundtrack Better Than Chocolate\"].
