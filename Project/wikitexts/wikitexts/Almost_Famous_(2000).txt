The plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[San Diego]] 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed college-professor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strong-willed Elaine's strict ban on [[rock music]] and her fear of pop culture have a negative effect on her children, finally driving William's 18-year-old sister Anita to move to [[San Francisco]] and become a flight attendant.\n\nIn 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anita's secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in [[San Diego]]. Rock journalist [[Lester Bangs]], impressed with William's writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a [[Black Sabbath]] concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran [[groupie]] Penny Lane, who has taken him under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny Lane insists she and her friends are \"band aids\", a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves.\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]] hires William to write an article about Stillwater, based on his skills, and sends him on the road with the band. William interviews the other band members, but Russell repeatedly puts him off. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe soon become evident and not helped at all by the band's first t-shirt, a full band shot that pictures Russell in full view while the rest of the band is in the shadows. William is jokingly called \"the enemy\" by the band as he is a journalist, but he gradually begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle.\n\nThe record label hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell's girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three prot\u00e9g\u00e9e band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalantly but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.\n\nPenny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where they are celebrating the news that they are to be featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone''. Penny is asked to leave after her attempts to get Russell's attention are noticed. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on [[methaqualone|quaaludes]].\n\nFlying to a gig the following day, the plane encounters severe weather. Fearing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russell's long-simmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.\n\nWilliam arrives at the ''Rolling Stone'' office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says his perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to \"be honest...and unmerciful.\" ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors rave over William's completed article, but when the magazine's fact checker calls the band, Russell lies to protect Stillwater's image, claiming most of it is false. ''Rolling Stone'' kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters a dejected William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to their home in San Diego, where their mother Elaine is glad to see them both.\n\nSapphire, one of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e \"Band Aids\", chastises Russell for betraying William. He then calls Penny, wanting to meet with her, but she gives him William's address. He arrives and finds himself face-to-face with William's mother who, during the tour, scolded him over the phone for his behavior. He apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell has verified the article to ''Rolling Stone'', which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to go to Morocco while Stillwater tours again by bus.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as William Miller\n** [[Michael Angarano]] as young William\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Russell Hammond\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Elaine Miller\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as [[Pennie Lane Trumbull|Penny Lane]] (Lady Goodman)\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Jeff Bebe\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Anita Miller\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Polexia Aphrodisia\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Sapphire\n* [[Bijou Phillips]] as Estrella Starr\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Dick Roswell\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[Lester Bangs]]\n* [[Terry Chen]] as [[Ben Fong-Torres]]\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Vic Munoz\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as Dennis Hope\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as David Felton\n* [[Mark Kozelek]] as Larry Fellows\n* Liz Stauber as Leslie Hammond\n* [[Zack Ward]] as [[Joseph L.
