It is the fourth and final installment of [[Warner Bros.]]'s initial [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]], a sequel to ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and the only film in the series made without the involvement of [[Tim Burton]] in any capacity. Directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]], it stars [[George Clooney]] as [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], replacing [[Val Kilmer]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Victor Fries (Batman & Robin)|Victor Fries / Mr. Freeze]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]] reprising his role as [[Dick Grayson (1989 film series character)|Dick Grayson / Robin]], alongside [[Uma Thurman]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Michael Gough]], [[Pat Hingle]], and [[Elle Macpherson]]. The film follows the titular characters as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze and [[Pamela Isley (Batman & Robin)|Poison Ivy]] from taking over the world, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together.\n\nWarner Bros. fast-tracked development for ''Batman & Robin'' following the box office success of ''Batman Forever''. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]''; Schumacher was given a mandate to make the film more [[toyetic]] than its predecessor, while basing its style on the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]] and ''Batman'' comic book artist [[Dick Sprang]]'s illustrations. After Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', Schumacher initially intended to cast [[William Baldwin]] in his place before George Clooney won the role. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and wrapped in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.\n\n''Batman & Robin'' premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997, and went into general release on June 20. Making $238.2&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of $125\u2013160&nbsp;million, the film was a box office disappointment and received largely negative reviews from critics, often considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Batman & Robin (1997)|worst films ever made]]. It is also the lowest-grossing live-action ''Batman'' film to date. One of the songs recorded for the film, \"[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]\" by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards]]. Due to the film's poor reception, Warner Bros. cancelled future ''Batman'' films, including Schumacher's planned ''[[Batman in film#Batman Unchained|Batman Unchained]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Batman]] and his partner, [[Dick Grayson (1989 film series character)|Robin]], encounter a new foe, [[Victor Fries (Batman & Robin)|Mr. Freeze]], who has left a string of diamond robberies in his wake. During a confrontation in the natural history museum, Freeze steals a bigger diamond and flees, freezing Robin and leaving Batman unable to pursue him. Later, Batman and Robin learn that Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a scientist working to develop a cure for MacGregor's Syndrome, hoping to heal his terminally ill wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]]. After a lab accident, Fries was rendered unable to live at average temperatures and forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds for survival.\n\nAt a [[Wayne Enterprises]] lab in Brazil, botanist [[Pamela Isley (Batman & Robin)|Dr. Pamela Isley]] is working under the deranged [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]], who has turned her research on plants into the [[supersoldier]] drug Venom. After witnessing Woodrue use the formula to turn serial killer Antonio Diego into the hulking [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], she threatens to expose Woodrue's experiments. Woodrue attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins; instead, Isley is mutated by the toxins into Poison Ivy. Ivy kills Woodrue, destroys the lab, and escapes to [[Gotham City]] with Bane, concocting a plan to use Wayne's money to support her research. Meanwhile, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she goes back to school.\n\nWayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. Batman and Robin decide to lure Freeze out using the Wayne Family diamonds and present them at a Wayne Enterprises charity event. Ivy attends the event and decides to use her abilities to seduce Batman and Robin. Freeze crashes the party but is defeated and detained in [[Arkham Asylum]]. Ivy takes an interest in Freeze and frees him from Arkham. Dick discovers that Barbara has been participating in [[Street racing|drag races]] to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's Syndrome; a fact he kept from Bruce and Dick.\n\nBatman, Robin, and the police arrive at Freeze's lair in response to his escape, discovering Nora preserved in a cryogenic chamber and that Freeze has developed a cure for the early stages of MacGregor's Syndrome. Freeze, Ivy, and Bane secretly arrive to recover Freeze's diamonds and Nora. Wanting Freeze for herself, Ivy unplugs Nora's chamber, steals the diamonds, and seduces Robin; escalating tensions between him and Batman. At Ivy's hideout, Ivy convinces Freeze that Batman has killed Nora. Freeze swears to freeze all of humanity in revenge, with Ivy planning to repopulate the earth using her mutant plants afterward. Freeze and Bane commandeer Gotham Observatory and convert the new telescope into a giant freeze ray, while Ivy uses the [[Bat-Signal]] to contact Robin. Robin attempts to go after Ivy alone, but Batman convinces him not to fall for Ivy's seduction. Barbara discovers the [[Batcave]], where an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes [[Batgirl]], arriving at Ivy's lair in time to help Batman and Robin subdue her.\n\nFreeze begins to encase Gotham in ice, and Batman, Robin, and Batgirl head to Gotham Observatory together to stop him. Batman defeats Freeze in combat, while Batgirl and Robin incapacitate Bane and thaw the city. Freeze accuses Batman of killing Nora, only to be shown a recording of Ivy admitting to the crime. Batman reveals that Nora is still alive and offers Freeze the chance to continue his research on MacGregor's Syndrome in exchange for his cure. Freeze accepts and returns to Arkham, where he is imprisoned in the same cell as Ivy, whom he promises to exact revenge on. Alfred receives the cure, and Bruce and Dick agree to let Barbara join them in fighting crime.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Victor Fries (Batman & Robin)|Dr. Victor Fries / Mr. Freeze]]:<br />A [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] who suffers an accident while trying to cryogenically preserve his terminally ill wife.
