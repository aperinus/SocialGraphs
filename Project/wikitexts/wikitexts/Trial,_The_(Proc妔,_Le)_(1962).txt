Welles stated immediately after completing the film: \"''The Trial'' is the best film I have ever made\".<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |title=Orson Welles on THE TRIAL |first=Huw |last=Wheldon |work=[[BBC]] |year=1962 |via=Wellesnet |access-date=6 March 2010}}</ref> The film begins with Welles narrating Kafka's parable \"[[Before the Law]]\" to [[pinscreen]] scenes created by the artist [[Alexandre Alexeieff]]. [[Anthony Perkins]] stars as Josef K., a bureaucrat who is accused of a never-specified crime, and [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Romy Schneider]], and [[Elsa Martinelli]] play women who become involved in various ways in Josef's trial and life. Welles plays the Advocate, Josef's lawyer and the film's principal antagonist.\n\n''The Trial'' has grown in reputation over the years, and some critics, including [[Roger Ebert]], have called it a masterpiece.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> It is often praised for its [[scenic design]] and [[cinematography]], the latter of which includes disorienting camera angles and unconventional use of [[focus (optics)|focus]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Taubin|first=Amy|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-06-20/film/are-you-defending-your-life/1/ |title=Are You Defending Your Life? |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=20 June 2000 |access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nJosef K. ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is sleeping in his bedroom, in an apartment he shares with other lodgers. He is awakened when a man in a suit opens his bedroom door. Josef assumes the glib man is a policeman, but the intruder does not identify himself and ignores Josef's demand to produce police ID. Several detectives enter and tell Josef he is under open arrest.  In another room Josef K. sees three co-workers from his place of employment; they are there to provide evidence regarding some unstated crime. The police refuse to inform Josef K. of his misdeeds, or if he is even being charged with a crime, and they do not take him into custody.\n\nAfter the detectives leave, Josef converses with his landlady, Mrs. Grubach ([[Madeleine Robinson]]), and neighbor, Miss B\u00fcrstner ([[Jeanne Moreau]]), about the strange visit. Later he goes to his office, where his supervisor thinks he has been having improper relations with his teenaged female cousin.  That evening, Josef attends the opera, but is abducted from the theater by a police inspector ([[Arnoldo Fo\u00e0]]) and brought to a courtroom, where he attempts in vain to confront the still-unstated case against him.\n\nJosef returns to his office and discovers the two police officers who first visited him being whipped in a small room.  Josef's uncle Max suggests that Josef consult with Hastler ([[Orson Welles]]), a law advocate.  After brief encounters with the wife of a courtroom guard ([[Elsa Martinelli]]) and a roomful of condemned men awaiting trial, Josef is granted an interview with Hastler, which proves unsatisfactory.\n\nHastler's mistress ([[Romy Schneider]]) suggests that Josef seek the advice of the artist Titorelli (William Chappell), but this also proves unhelpful.  Seeking refuge in a cathedral, Josef learns from a priest (Michael Lonsdale) that he has been condemned to death. Hastler abruptly appears at the cathedral to confirm the priest's assertion.\n\nOn the evening before his thirty-first birthday, Josef is apprehended by two executioners and brought to a quarry pit, where he is forced to remove some of his clothing.  The executioners pass a knife back and forth, apparently deliberating on who will do the deed, before handing the knife to the condemned man, who refuses to commit suicide.  The executioners leave Josef in the quarry and toss dynamite in the pit. Josef laughs at his executioners and picks up the dynamite. From a distance one can hear an explosion and smoke billows into the air.<ref name=PC>{{cite book|last=Cowie |first=Peter |title=A Ribbon of Dreams: The Cinema of Orson Welles |year=1973 |publisher=A.S.

Salkind had originally wanted Welles to make a film of Nikolai Gogol's novella ''[[Taras Bulba]]''. When Salkind found out that producer [[Harold Hecht]] was already making a version of ''[[Taras Bulba (1962 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' with [[Yul Brynner]] in the lead, he offered Welles a list of 82 other film titles to choose from. From that selection, Welles decided ''The Trial'' would be the most feasible film to make.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Filming 'The Trial'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbUe-bM6bXg |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211219/RbUe-bM6bXg |archive-date=2021-12-19 |url-status=live|via=[[YouTube]]|year=1981|first=Orson|last=Welles|medium=Documentary|publisher=[[Munich Film Museum]]|access-date=11 March 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> (Earlier that year, [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] - who may have been Welles's son - had casually mentioned an idea to Welles about adapting ''The Trial'' as a stage play, prompting Welles to state that ''The Trial'' was an important book and that he, Welles, should re-read it.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Lindsay-Hogg |first=Michael |title=Luck and Circumstance: A Coming of Age in Hollywood, New York and Points Beyond |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

In adapting the work, he rearranged the order of Kafka's chapters. In this version, the chapter line-up read 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 8, 7, 9, 10. However, the order of Kafka's chapters was arranged by his literary executor, Max Brod, after the writer's death, and this order is not definitive. Welles also modernized several aspects of the story, introducing computer technology and changing Miss Burstner's profession from a typist to a cabaret performer. Welles also opened the film with a fable from the book about a man who is permanently detained from seeking access to the Law by a guard. To illustrate this allegory, he used the [[pin screen]] animation of [[Alexandre Alexeieff]], who created animated prints using thousands of pins.<ref name=PC />\n\nWelles also changed the manner of Josef K.'s death. Kafka originally had the executioners pass the knife over the head of Josef K., thus giving him the opportunity to take the weapon and kill himself, in a more dignified manner - Josef K. does not; instead he is fatally stabbed by his executioners in the heart, and as he dies Josef K. says \"like a dog.\" In the film, whilst the executioners still offer him the knife, Josef K. refuses to take it, and goads the executioners by yelling \"You'll have to do it!\"  The film ends with the smoke of the fatal dynamite blast forming a mushroom cloud in the air while Welles reads the closing credits on the soundtrack.<ref name=PC />\n\nAnother notable change is that of Josef's relationships with the numerous women in the film. Although Josef seems to be interested in Miss B\u00fcrstner, his later interactions with Hilda and Leni are dispassionate and awkward. In the film, Josef shows little romantic attention to Leni, and she often touches him sexually without him asking her to. [[Henry Jaglom]], a friend of Welles's, claimed that Welles confided in him, saying that he knew Perkins was gay \"and used that quality in Perkins to suggest another texture in Joseph K, a fear of exposure. The whole homosexuality thing\u2014using Perkins that way\u2014was incredible for that time. It was intentional on Orson's part: He had these three gorgeous women (Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli) trying to seduce this guy, who was completely repressed and incapable of responding.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/> Jaglom went on to say, \"The closetedness of Perkins' homosexuality... he thought that brought a whole wonderful subtext. I remember him saying that they never talked about it, but he felt that Perkins definitely knew what he was doing.\"<ref name=SFG>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/REPEAT-PERFORMANCE-Welles-Rare-Masterpiece-2813363.php |title=REPEAT PERFORMANCE / Welles' Rare Masterpiece Restored / Film based on Kafka's 'The Trial' opens at the Castro |first=Edward |last=Guthmann |year=2000 |access-date=30 July 2022}}</ref> Film critic Roger Ebert theorized that this \"could be interpreted as a nightmare in which women make demands [Josef] K is uninterested in meeting.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/> This has led some to believe that ''The Trial'' might have queer undertones.<ref name=PopMatters>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/175398-aspects-of-orson-orson-welles-the-trial-a-study-in-transcendental-so-2495722799.html |title=Orson Welles' 'The Trial' Is a Study in Transcendental Psychology |first=Andrew |last=Grossman |year=2013 |access-date=30 July 2022}}</ref>\n\nWelles initially hoped to cast U.S. comic actor [[Jackie Gleason]] as Hastler, but he took the role himself when Gleason rejected the part.<ref name=FT /> Welles also dubbed the dialogue for 11 actors in ''The Trial''. Welles reportedly dubbed a few lines of Anthony Perkins\u2019 dialogue and challenged Perkins to identify the dubbing. Perkins was unable to locate the lines where Welles dubbed his voice.<ref name=PB>{{cite book |last=Bogdanovich |first=Peter |title=Who the Hell's In It? |year=2004 |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A.

Sallis pronounces the episode to be \"Kafka-esque, to coin a phrase\", but does not reveal whether he actually did go through with the dubbing.\n\nWelles began the production in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. To create Josef K.\u2019s workplace, he created a set in an exposition hall just outside [[Zagreb]], where 850 secretaries banged typewriters at 850 office desks. Other sequences were later shot in [[Dubrovnik]], [[Rome]], [[Milan]] and [[Paris]].<ref name= FB /> Welles was not able to film ''The Trial'' in Kafka\u2019s home city of [[Prague]], as his work was seen as decadent by the communist government in [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=BBC/>\n\nIn Paris, Welles planned to shoot the interiors of his film at the Bois de Boulogne studios, but Salkind had difficulties collecting promised capital to finance the film. Instead, he used the [[Gare d'Orsay]], an abandoned Parisian railway station. Welles rearranged his set design to accommodate this new setting, and he later defended his decision to film at Gare d'Orsay in an interview with ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', where he stated: \"Everything was improvised at the last moment, because the whole physical concept of my film was quite different. It was based on the absence of sets. And the gigantic nature of the sets, which people have objected to, is partly due to the fact that the only setting I had was that old abandoned station.\"<ref name=FB />\n\nWelles edited ''The Trial'' in Paris while technically on vacation; he commuted in on weekends from M\u00e1laga, Spain, where he was taking time to film sequences (reported as being \"the prologue and epilogue\") for his self-financed film adaptation of ''[[Don Quixote (unfinished film)|Don Quixote]]'', to oversee the post-production work.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=29 June 1962 |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897955,00.html |title=Movies Abroad: Prodigal Revived |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a later interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Anthony Perkins stated that Welles gave him the direction that ''The Trial'' was meant to be seen as a [[black comedy]]. Perkins would also state his greatest professional pride came in being the star of a Welles-directed feature.<ref name=PB />\n\nWhile filming in Zagreb, Welles met 21-year-old Croatian actress Olga Palinka\u0161. He renamed her [[Oja Kodar]], and she became Welles' companion and occasional artistic collaborator during the latter years of his career.<ref name=FB />\n\n==Release==\n\nWelles initially planned to premiere ''The Trial'' at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 1962, but the film was not completed in time. The festival organizers showed the [[Academy Award]] winning musical ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/09/07/archives/orson-welles-film-dropped-at-venice.html |title=Orson Welles Film Dropped at Venice |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 September 1962|access-date=6 March 2010|page=35}}</ref>\n\nWelles continued to edit the film up until its December 1962 premiere in Paris. In an interview with the [[BBC]], he mentioned that on the eve of the premiere he jettisoned a ten-minute sequence (it is actually about six minutes long) where Josef K. meets with a computer scientist (played by Greek actress [[Katina Paxinou]]) who uses her technology to predict his fate. Welles explained the last-minute cut by noting: \"I only saw the film as a whole once. We were still in the process of doing the mixing, and then the premiere fell on us... [The scene] should have been the best in the film and it wasn't. Something went wrong, I don't know why, but it didn't succeed.\"<ref name=BBC />\n\nUltimately, the US theatrical release of ''The Trial'' came in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93899/The-Trial/|title=The Trial (1963)|website=TCM}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Contemporary===\n''The Trial'' polarized critics upon release. Immediately after its completion, Welles said, \"Say what you like, but ''The Trial'' is the best film I have ever made.\"<ref name=BBC/> The film was reacted to more positively in France, where it won the \"Best Film\" award of the [[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]] in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]]'s 1970 biography of Welles dismissed the film as \"an agonizing experience ... a dead thing, like some tablet found among the dust of forgotten men, speaking a language that has much to say to us, but whose words have largely been rubbed away.\"\n\n===Retrospective===\nOver the years, the film has continued to polarize film critics and scholars. Along with continued criticism, much contemporary analysis is more positive.
