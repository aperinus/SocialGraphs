D. Spradlin]] set in the decadent world of American professional football in the late 1970s. It was directed by [[Ted Kotcheff]] and based on the best-selling 1973 novel by [[Peter Gent]]. The screenplay was by Kotcheff, Gent, [[Frank Yablans]], and [[Nancy Dowd]] (uncredited). This was the first film role for Davis, a popular [[country music]] recording artist.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late-1970s, Phil Elliott plays [[wide receiver]] for the North Dallas Bulls [[Professional gridiron football|professional football]] team, based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], which closely resembles the [[Dallas Cowboys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misterhabs.com/TV_movie.htm |title= Television & Film Helmets| website= misterhabs.com| publisher= | date= |access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mghelmets.com/movies.html| title= Movie/TV helmets |website= mghelmets.com| publisher= | date= | access-date=29 December 2017 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081535/http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |archive-date=14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough considered to possess \"the best hands in the game\", the aging Elliott has been [[Substitution (sport)|benched]] and relies heavily on [[painkillers]]. Elliott and popular [[quarterback]] Seth Maxwell are outstanding players, but they characterize the drug-, sex-, and alcohol-fueled party atmosphere of that era. Elliott wants only to play the game, retire, and live on a [[horse farm]] with his girlfriend Charlotte, an aspiring writer who appears to be financially independent due to a [[trust fund]] from her wealthy family and who has no interest whatsoever in football.\n\nThe Bulls play for iconic Coach Strother, who turns a blind eye to anything that his players may be doing off the field or anything that his assistant coaches and trainers condone to keep those players in the game. The coach is focused on player \"tendencies\", a quantitative measurement of their performance, and seems less concerned about the human aspect of the game and the players. One player, Shaddock, finally erupts to assistant Coach Johnson: \"Every time I call it a 'game', you call it a 'business'. And every time I call it a 'business', you call it a 'game'.\" The coaches manipulate Elliott to convince a younger, injured [[rookie]] on the team to start using painkillers.\n\nElliott's nonconformist attitude incurs the coach's wrath more than once, and at one point, the coach informs Elliott that his continuing attitude could affect his future career with the Bulls. In the final game of the season, Elliot catches a touchdown pass with no time left on the clock to get North Dallas to within one point of division rival Chicago, but the Bulls lose the game due to a mishandled [[snap (football)|snap]] on the extra point attempt. In a meeting with the team owners and Coach Strother, Elliott learns that a Dallas detective has been hired by the Bulls to follow him. They reveal proof of his [[marijuana]] use and a sexual relationship with a woman named Joanne, who intends to marry team executive Emmett Hunter, the brother of owner Conrad Hunter. It is loosely implied that Emmett [[closeted homosexual|might be gay]], and it is why she went to Elliot for her sexual needs. Although the detective witnessed quarterback Seth Maxwell engaging in similar behavior, he pretends not to have recognized him. They tell Elliott that he is to be suspended without pay pending a league hearing, and Elliott, convinced that the entire investigation is merely a pretext to allow the team to save money on his contract, quits the team, telling the Hunter brothers that he does not need their money that bad.\n\nAs he is leaving the team's headquarters in downtown Dallas, Elliot runs into Maxwell, who seems to have been waiting for him. Elliot informs him that he quit, prompting Maxwell to ask if his name came up in the meeting. Elliot deduces that Maxwell knew about the investigation the entire time. As Elliot walks away, Maxwell briefly reminisces about their time together on and off the football field. Maxwell prompts Elliot to turn around and throws a football to him, but Elliot lets it hit him in the chest and fall incomplete as he shrugs and throws his arms into the air, signifying that he truly is done with the game.\n\n==Behind the scenes==\nPart drama, comedy, and satire, ''North Dallas Forty'' is widely considered a classic [[sports film]], giving insights into the lives of professional athletes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=35647|title=- Trailer - Showtimes - Cast - Movies - New York Times|website=movies2.nytimes.com|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nBased on the semiautobiographical novel by Peter Gent, a Cowboys wide receiver in the late 1960s, the film's characters closely resemble team members of that era, with Seth Maxwell often compared to quarterback [[Don Meredith]], B.A. Strother to [[Tom Landry]], and Elliott to Gent. Of the story, Meredith said, \"If I'd known Gent was as good as he says he was, I would have thrown to him more.\"<ref>''[[D Magazine]]'' (''Dallas'' Magazine), \"The 35 Biggest Pop Culture Moments in Modern Dallas History,\" January, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Phil Elliott\n* [[Mac Davis]] as Seth Maxwell\n* [[G.D.

In her review for ''The New York Times'', Janet Maslin wrote \"The central friendship in the movie, beautifully delineated, is the one between Mr. Nolte and Mac Davis, who expertly plays the team's quarterback, a man whose calculating nature and complacency make him all the more likable, somehow.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = ''Dallas Forty'': Cynicism and Comedy | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 1, 1979 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940CEED91E38E732A25752C0A96E9C946890D6CF | access-date = 2011-02-23 }}</ref> ''Time'' magazine's Richard Schickel wrote \"'North Dallas Forty' retains enough of the original novel's authenticity to deliver strong, if brutish, entertainment\".<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Schickel | first = Richard | title = Strong Medicine | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = September 3, 1979 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948619,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100901020637/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948619,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = September 1, 2010 | access-date = 2011-02-23 }}</ref> ''Newsweek'' magazine's David Ansen wrote \"The writers -- Kotcheff, Gent and producer Frank Yablans -- are nonetheless to be congratulated for allowing their story to live through its characters, abjuring [[Rocky]]-like fantasy configurations for the harder realities of the game.

Recurring scenes of television and radio news reporting violent crimes, war and environmental destruction are scattered throughout various scenes, but left out in the same scenes recreated in the movie. Throughout the novel there is more graphic sex and violence, as well as drug and alcohol abuse without the comic overtones of the film; for instance, the harassment of an unwilling girl at a party that is played for laughs in the movie is a brutal near-rape at an orgy in the novel.\n\nAt the end of the novel, there is a shocking twist ending in which Phil returns to Charlotte to tell her he has left football and to presumably continue his relationship with her on her ranch, but finds that she and a black friend (David Clarke, who is not in the movie) have been regular lovers, unknown to Phil, and that they have been violently murdered. The murderer is Charlotte's ex-boyfriend and football groupie Bob Boudreau (who is also not in the movie); Boudreau has been stalking her throughout the novel. In the novel, Charlotte was a widow whose husband was an Army officer who had been killed in Vietnam; Charlotte had told Phil that her husband had decided to resign his commission, but had been killed in action while the request was being processed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5847792/the-impact-and-the-darkness-the-lasting-effect-of-peter-gents-north-dallas-forty|title=The Impact And The Darkness: The Lasting Effect Of Peter Gent's North Dallas Forty|first=Michael|last=Oriard|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079640/reviews|title=North Dallas Forty (1979)|access-date=29 December 2017|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Any Given Sunday]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{AFI film|68140}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0079640|title=North Dallas Forty}}\n*[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=35647 New York Times movie review]\n*[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/north_dallas_forty/ RottenTomatoes reviews]\n\n{{Ted Kotcheff}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American football films]]\n[[Category:Dallas Cowboys]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ted Kotcheff]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Scott (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Dallas]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
