It stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Kim Cattrall]], and [[Olivia Williams]].\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and won numerous cinematic awards including Best Director for Polanski at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and also at the [[23rd European Film Awards]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/05/roman-polanski-film-ghost-writer | title=Roman Polanski film The Ghost Writer dominates European awards | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=5 December 2010 | access-date=14 April 2014 | last=Brooks | first=Xan}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2022}}<!--- massively bloated 850-word \"synopsis\" versus 400-700 word norm --->\nA [[ghostwriter]] is hired by the [[Publishing|publishing firm]] Rhinehart, Inc. to complete the [[autobiography]] of the former [[British Prime Minister]] Adam Lang. The ghostwriter\u2019s predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in a drowning accident. The ghostwriter travels to Old Haven on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], where Lang and his wife Ruth are staying with Lang's aides, including Amelia Bly. Originally staying at a hotel, the ghostwriter is relocated to Lang's estate when the media descend on the island after learning of Lang's presence there.\n\nThe former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] Richard Rycart accuses Lang of authorizing the [[Extraordinary rendition|forcible abduction]] of suspected terrorists, a possible [[war crime]]. Lang faces prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]] unless he stays in the United States (which doesn't recognize the ICC's jurisdiction). While Lang is in [[Washington, DC]], the ICC announce the beginning of an investigation into the accusations. The ghostwriter finds an envelope containing photographs and a phone number in McAra's old room. The ghostwriter calls the number and discovers that it belongs to Rycart. While out cycling in the rain, the ghostwriter speaks to a local elderly man and learns that the current could not have carried McAra's body to the site on the beach at which it was found, which indicates that someone planted the body there; a local woman saw flashlights on the beach on the night it was found but she later fell down the stairs and is now in a coma.\n\nRuth and the ghostwriter have dinner together while Lang is away and the ghostwriter explains his discoveries about McAra. That alarms Ruth, who rushes outside to clear her head. When she returns, she tells him that Lang and McAra argued the night before his death over something. Ruth and the ghostwriter have a [[one-night stand]].\n\nThe ghostwriter takes McAra's car with the intent of returning to his hotel, but he follows the pre-programmed directions on the car's [[Satellite navigation|sat nav]] instead. The car takes the ghostwriter to the [[Belmont, Massachusetts]] home of Professor Paul Emmett.\n\nEmmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite several pictures of the pair together. When the ghostwriter tells Emmett the sat nav proves that McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive.\n\nSomeone follows the ghostwriter on the way back to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and he tries to escape on the ferry. When they follow him onto the ferry, he jumps off as it is leaving the dock and checks into a nearby hotel. With no one else to turn to, the ghostwriter asks Rycart for help. The ghostwriter researches links between Emmett and a [[Arms industry|military contractor]] as well as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Rycart reveals that McAra [[News leak|gave him documents]] linking Lang to so-called \"torture flights\" in which terrorist suspects were placed on private jets to be tortured while airborne.\n\nRycart claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in \"the beginning\" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The ghostwriter discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, and Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests.\n\nThe ghostwriter is contacted by Lang, who is returning from Washington on his private jet and offers him a lift, which Rycart insists he accept to avoid suspicion. Armed with the evidence, the ghostwriter confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett, which Lang angrily denies. When the plane lands, Lang is assassinated by a man armed with a rifle - he had a son who died \"in one of Lang's illegal wars.\" The assassin is shot dead by Lang's bodyguards. The ghostwriter is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication.\n\nAt the book's launch party in London, the ghostwriter learns from Amelia that Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was at [[Harvard University]]. Whilst going through the original manuscript, he learns that it was suspected of being a security risk and that the truth was in \"the beginnings\". Going through the manuscript in a back room, the ghostwriter discovers that McAra wrote the truth [[Acrostic|by using the first few words of each of the first few chapters]], which spell out, \"Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.\" He concludes that Ruth ensured that every decision Lang made as Prime Minister directly benefited the US. The ghostwriter passes a note to Ruth that reveals his discovery. She unfolds the note and is devastated. She sees the ghostwriter raising a glass to her. The ghostwriter leaves the party and Ruth tries to follow him, but Emmett stops her. As the ghostwriter crosses the street a car accelerates in his direction, and a thud is heard. Witnesses react in horror, and the pages containing McAra's manuscript scatter in the wind.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as the Ghost, the unnamed [[ghostwriter]]\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Adam Lang, a former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]]\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Amelia Bly, Lang's personal assistant\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Ruth Lang, Lang's wife\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Paul Emmett, a professor at [[Harvard Law School]]\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Sidney Kroll, Lang's American lawyer\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as Rick Ricardelli, the ghostwriter's [[Literary agent|agent]]\n* [[Tim Preece]] as Roy, managing director of Rhinehart's [[London]] business\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Richard Rycart, UN Envoy and former British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]]\n* [[David Rintoul]] as the Stranger, a grieving father who lost his son during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]]\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as the Old Man at Martha's Vineyard\n\nIn addition, [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] plays John Maddox, Rhinehart's [[New York City|New York]] executive.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=The Ghostwriter - ferry.jpg\n|image2=The Ghostwriter-Old Haven police car.jpg\n|caption1=The North Sea ferry MS ''SyltExpress'' that was used as the Martha's Vineyard ferry in the film.\n|caption2=A prop Ford Crown Victoria used in the film as a police car.\n}}\nPolanski had originally teamed with Robert Harris for a film of Harris's novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'',<ref name=\"Siegel 2010\">{{cite web |last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |title=Roman Polanski returns with 'Ghost' - Entertainment News, Film News, Media |website=Variety |date=2010-11-16 |url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117975536?refCatId=13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116070835/https://variety.com/article/VR1117975536?refCatId=13 |archive-date=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> but the project was cancelled because of the looming actors' strike that autumn.<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1670046/roman_polanski_flees_pompeii/ Rotten Tomatoes 12 September 2007: Roman Polanski Flees Pompeii].
