Starring [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Joe Seneca]] and [[Jami Gertz]], the film was written by [[John Fusco]] and directed by [[Walter Hill]] and features an original score by [[Ry Cooder]] featuring classical guitar by [[William Kanengiser]] and [[harmonica]] by [[Sonny Terry]]. [[Steve Vai]] appears in the film as the devil's virtuosic guitar player in the climactic guitar duel.\n\nFusco was a traveling blues musician prior to attending [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts]], where he wrote ''Crossroads'' as an assignment in a master class led by the screenwriting giants [[Waldo Salt]] and [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] The student screenplay won first place in the national FOCUS Awards (Films of College and University Students) and was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]] while Fusco was still a student.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n17-year-old Eugene Martone has a fascination for [[blues]] music while studying [[classical guitar]] at the [[Juilliard School]] for Performing Arts in New York City. Researching blues and guitar music brings famed [[Robert Johnson]]'s mythically creative acclaim to his attention; especially intriguing are the legends surrounding exactly how Johnson became so talented \u2013 most notably the one claiming he \"sold his soul to the [[Devil]] at the crossroads\", as well as a famed \"missing song\" that was lost, supposedly evermore, to the world.\n\nIn his quest to find this song, he researches old archived newspaper clippings, learning that Johnson's longtime friend, musician [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]], is alive and incarcerated for murder or attempted murder in a nearby minimum security hospital. Eugene goes to see the elderly man, who denies several times that he is ''that'' Willie Brown. He finally admits his identity after hearing Eugene play some blues (but notes that Eugene \"plays with no soul\"). Willie then says he knows the missing Robert Johnson tune in question but refuses to give it to Eugene unless the boy breaks him out of the facility and gets him to Mississippi, where he has unfinished business to settle. Eugene agrees and they head south. The boy soon realizes, however, that Willie is constantly running minor scams such as claiming that he has more money than he actually has to cover their bus tickets. With only $40 on them, they end up \"[[hobo]]ing\" from Memphis to rural Mississippi.\n\nDuring their quest, Eugene and Willie experience the blues legacy of Robert Johnson first-hand, taking part in an impromptu jam session at a \"[[juke joint|jook joint]]\"<!--- spelling per jookhouse in closing credits ---> (as Willie calls it), where Eugene is given the nickname \"Lightning Boy\" by Willie because of his musical skill. Eugene jokingly suggests to Willie that he himself ought to \"sell his soul to the Devil at the crossroads\", Willie angrily slaps him and demands he not joke about that.\n\nThe pair meet 17-year-old Frances, who is fleeing her abusive stepfather. She hitchhikes with them, and she and Eugene start a relationship. When she abandons them, to continue her own journey, Eugene is left heartbroken but with a deeper feeling for the blues.\n\nWillie helps Eugene buy a portable [[Pignose]] amplifier, through which Eugene plays his old [[Fender Telecaster]].  Willie tells Eugene that the secret of playing the blues is using a [[Slide guitar|slide]]. Willie confesses that there is no missing Johnson song, but tells the boy that he has proven himself far beyond what learning any blues song could ever teach him.\n\nThey reach a deserted crossroads in rural Mississippi, where Willie reveals his secret: his ability on the harmonica came about because of a deal with the Devil, which he made at this very location. Willie now hopes to end the deal. The Devil, who calls himself [[Old Scratch|Scratch]] and [[Papa Legba|Legba]], shows up and insists that the contract for Willie's soul is still valid, even if Willie is dissatisfied with how his life turned out.\n\nEugene, believing the other two are joking around, steps into the conversation. The Devil offers a challenge: if Eugene can come to a special concert and win a [[guitar battle]] against his ringer guitarist, then Willie gets his soul back. If Eugene loses, then Eugene too forfeits his soul. Despite Willie's protests, Eugene agrees to the deal. Willie and Eugene are transported to a music hall, where metal-blues guitar master Jack Butler, who also sold his soul for musical ability, is wowing the crowd with his prowess. Eugene, now understanding the situation, receives a mojo bag from Willie to hold in his pocket. He also slips his slide on, giving him a perceived advantage over his opponent.\n\nEugene and Butler trade flamboyant guitar parts, with each able to top the other. Eventually, Eugene falls back on his classical training, playing a fast and difficult piece that Butler cannot match. Dejected, Butler drops his guitar and strides off, and the Devil tears up Willie's contract, freeing the bluesman's soul.\n\nWillie and Eugene are transported back to Mississippi, where they start walking again, talking of cities they plan to visit.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ralph Macchio]] as Eugene Martone\n*[[Joe Seneca]] as [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]]\n*[[Jami Gertz]] as Frances\n*[[Joe Morton]] as Scratch's Assistant\n*[[Robert Judd (actor)|Robert Judd]] as [[Old Scratch|Scratch]]\n*[[Steve Vai]] as Jack Butler\n*[[Dennis Lipscomb]] as Lloyd\n*[[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Bartender\n*[[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]] as Sheriff Tilford\n*[[Allan Arbus]] as Dr. Santis\n*[[Gretchen Palmer]] as Beautiful Girl/Dancer\n*Al Fann as Pawnbroker\n*Sammie Minniefield Jr as Pete\n*Wally Taylor as O.Z.\n*[[Tim Russ]] as [[Robert Johnson]]\n*Tex Donaldson as John McGraw\n*Guy Killum as Willie at 17\n*[[Akosua Busia]] as Woman at Boardinghouse\n*Edward Walsh as Harley Terhune\n*[[Allan Graf]] as Alvin\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe script was an original by John Fusco, who had long been interested in blues music. He worked as a blues singer and musician but had been warned by a doctor to rest his voice. In 1981 his girlfriend, who was working at a rest home, told him that an old black man with a harmonica had been admitted. Fusco went to visit him and on the way dreamt up a story about what would happen if the player was a legendary blues player. This gave him the idea for the story.<ref>{{cite news| last=Van Gelder |first= Lawrence |title=Happy Ending for a Former Blues Singer |work= The New York Times| date= 14 March 1986 |page= C8}}</ref> He expanded on the myth of [[Robert Johnson]] selling his soul to the Devil at the crossroads. Coincidentally, Johnson was inducted to the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame#Inductees|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1986, while the film was in production.\n\nFusco wrote the script as his Master's Thesis at [[New York University]]. It was only his second screenplay. Producer Mark Carliner acted as Fusco's independent adviser on it and later helped get it made.<ref>{{cite news| title= Film Clips: Getting Through 'Oz' with Help of His Friends Film Clips: A Little Help | last= Mathews |first= Jack |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 21 June 1985 |page= F1}}</ref> Fusco was paid $250,000.<ref>{{cite news| title= Focus Plots Happy Beginnings: Focus 1985 | last= Horn |first=  John |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 31 Aug 1985| page=sd_e1}}</ref>\n\nJami Gertz was cast as the female lead. \"She had the warmth I was looking for\", Hill said, \"and she was feisty, but I wondered, is she strong enough?

The identity of the red [[superstrat]] guitar that Butler plays on-screen became something of a mystery.
