Based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Howard the Duck|character of the same name]], the film was produced by [[Gloria Katz]] and written by Huyck and Katz, with [[George Lucas]] as executive producer. The screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film, but the [[film adaptation]] became live-action because of a contractual obligation. Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, this was the first attempt at a theatrical release since the ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]'' serial of 1944.\n\nLucas proposed adapting the comic book following the production of ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973). After multiple production difficulties and mixed response to test screenings, ''Howard the Duck'' was released in theaters on August 1, 1986. Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure and was criticized for its humor, performances, inconsistent tone, and the appearance of the title character, though the effects and soundtrack were mostly praised. In the years since, it has been considered among the [[List of films considered the worst#Howard the Duck (1986)|worst films ever made]], but has also developed a [[Cult film|cult following]].<ref name=\"PrimerStories\">{{cite web | last = Chipman | first = Bob | title = DUCK FAILS HOLLYWOOD BETS IT ALL ON DUCK BONERS | url = https://www.primerand.co/5/howard | work = Primer&Co. | access-date = May 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screencrush.com/howard-the-duck-chad-johnson/|title = The Bizarre Reason 'Howard the Duck' is Suddenly Trending}}</ref> It was nominated for seven [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Awards]] (winning four), and made about US$38 million (US$16.3 million domestically) compared to its US$30\u201337 million budget.<ref name=\"budget\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.filmsite.org/greatestflops11.html |title= Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Film Flops: The Most Notable Examples 1985-1986 |author= Tim Dirks |website= FilmSite.org |access-date= October 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Howard the Duck]] is 27 years old and lives on Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth, but inhabited by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] ducks and orbited by twin moons. As he is reading PlayDuck in his living room, his armchair suddenly propels him out of his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on [[Earth]], in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs, whom he defeats using [[Howard the Duck#Powers and abilities|a unique style of martial arts]]. The woman introduces herself as [[Beverly Switzler]], and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night.\n\nThe following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumburtt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a lab assistant, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa, but eventually quits and returns to Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard wins.\n\nHoward rejoins Beverly backstage after the band's performance and accompanies her back to her apartment, where Beverly persuades him to be the band's new manager. The two begin to flirt, but they are interrupted by Blumburtt and two of his colleagues, who reveal that a laser spectroscope they were inventing was aimed at Howard's planet and transported him to Earth when it was activated. They theorize that Howard can be sent back to his world through a reversal of this same process.\n\nUpon their arrival at the laboratory, the laser spectroscope malfunctions upon activation, raising the possibility of something else being transported to Earth. At this point, Dr. Walter Jenning is possessed by a life form from a distant region of space. When they visit a diner, the creature introduces itself as a \"Dark Overlord of the Universe\" and demonstrates its developing mental powers by destroying the table, utensils, and condiments. A fight ensues when a group of truckers in the diner begins to insult Howard. Howard is captured and is almost killed by the diner chef, but the Dark Overlord destroys the diner and escapes with Beverly.\n\nHoward locates Phil, who is arrested for his presence at the laboratory with no security clearance. After they escape, they discover an [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight aircraft]], which they use to search for the Dark Overlord and Beverly. At the laboratory, the Dark Overlord plans to transfer another of his kind into Beverly's body with the dimension machine. Howard and Phil arrive and seemingly destroy the Dark Overlord with an experimental neutron disintegrator, but the creature is merely forced out of Jenning's body and now attacks them in his true form. Howard fires the neutron disintegrator at the hideous beast, obliterating him. He then destroys the laser spectroscope, preventing more Dark Overlords from arriving on Earth, but also ruining his only chance of returning to Duckworld. Howard then becomes Beverly's manager, hires Phil as an employee on her tour, and performs with her on stage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ed Gale]] as [[Howard the Duck]] {{small|(suit performer)}}\n* [[Jordan Prentice]] as Howard the Duck {{small|(additional suit performer)}}\n* [[Timothy D.

According to Marvin Antonowsky, \"Sidney [Sheinberg] lobbied very hard for ''Howard the Duck''\", because the studio had passed on previous projects in which Lucas was involved, which had been very successful.<ref>{{cite book |last = Sharp |first = Kathleen |title = Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood: Edie and Lew Wasserman and Their Entertainment Empire |year = 2004 |publisher = Carroll & Graf Publishers |isbn = 0-7867-1419-0 |page = 451 |chapter = Safeguarding the Legacy: 1981\u20132002}}</ref> Sheinberg denied any involvement in ''Howard the Duck'', claiming that he never read the screenplay.<ref name = \"Dick\">{{cite book |last = Dick |first = Bernard F. |title = City of Dreams: The Making and Remaking of Universal Pictures |year = 1997 |publisher = University Press of Kentucky |isbn = 0-8131-2016-0 |page = 178 |chapter = In the Embrace of the Octopus}}</ref> Huyck and Katz strongly felt that the film should be animated. Because Universal needed a film for a summer release and thinking that animating the film would take too long or cost too much, Lucas suggested that the film could be produced in live-action, with special effects created by ILM.<ref name = \"LookBack-1\" />\n\nProduction designer Peter Jamison and director of photography Richard Kline were hired to give the film a look similar to that of a color comic book.<ref name = \"LookBack-1\" /> Throughout the shoot, Huyck shot multiple segments establishing Duckworld, designed by Jamison. In the opening shot, the skyline displayed could easily be New York City but for the two moons visible in the sky (at similar angles from one another as the two suns of [[Tatooine]] in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film).

Early on in the production, it was decided that the personality of the character would be changed from that of the comics, in which Howard was rude and obnoxious, to make the character nicer.<ref name = \"Stempel\">{{cite book |last = Tom |first = Stempel |title = Framework: A History of Screenwriting in the American Film |year = 2000 |publisher = Syracuse University Press |isbn = 0-8156-0654-0 |page = 207 |chapter = Alumni}}</ref> Gerber read over the script and offered his comments and suggestions. In addition, Huyck and Katz met with Gerber to discuss a horror sequence with which they were having difficulty.<ref name=\"DAK38\"/>\n\nDuring the screenwriting process, a stronger emphasis was placed on special effects, rather than satire and story.<ref name = \"Stempel\" /> Overall, the tone of the film is in diametric opposition to the comics. Whereas Katz declared, \"It's a film about a duck from outer space... It's not supposed to be an existential experience... We're supposed to have fun with this concept, but for some reason reviewers weren't able to get over that problem.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://comicsbulletin.com/if-it-aint-funk-he-dont-feel-it-howard-duck-1986/ |title = F.O.O.M.

There it is. The cosmic giggle. The funniest gag in the universe. That life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view. Anyone who doesn't believe this probably cannot enjoy reading ''Howard the Duck''.\"<ref>''Mediascene'' #25.</ref> However, after shooting was finished, Gerber stated that he felt the film was faithful to both the spirit of the comic book and the characters of Howard and Beverly.<ref name=\"DAK38\"/>\n\nAn early proposed storyline involved the character being transported to [[Hawaii]]. Huyck states that this storyline was considered because \"we thought it would be sort of fun to shoot there\". According to Katz, they did not want to explain how Howard arrived on Earth initially, but later rewrote the screenplay so that the film would begin on Howard's homeworld.<ref>{{cite news |last= Zimmerman |first= Dwight Jon |date = September 1986 |title = Gloria Katz |work = [[Comics Interview]] |issue = 38 |pages = 50\u201355 |publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]] }}</ref> Huyck and Katz wanted to incorporate both lighter, humorous elements and darker, suspenseful elements. Katz states that some readers were confused by the sexual elements of the screenplay, as they were unsure as to whether the film was intended for adults or children. Huyck and Katz wrote the ending leaving the story open for a sequel, which was never produced.<ref name = \"LookBack-1\" />\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe film was originally intended to be animated based on the character created by [[Steve Gerber]] and quoting scripts by [[Bill Mantlo]]. In particular, the \"Duckworld\" story of ''Howard the Duck'' magazine #6 was to serve as a basis for the script. A contractual obligation required Lucas to provide a distributor with a live-action film, so he decided to make the film using [[Live action|live actors]] and to use special effects for Howard. Katz said that an animated film \"would have taken too much time and too much money.\"<ref name=\"Decider\">{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2016/03/11/howard-the-duck-the-oral-history/?_ga=1.192178989.608980329.1302539496|title='Howard The Duck': The Oral History|work=[[New York Post#Website|Decider]]|last=Gaines|first=Caseen|date=Mar 11, 2016|access-date=May 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe script significantly altered the personality of the title character, played the story straight instead of as a satire, removed the surrealist elements, and added supernatural elements that could highlight special effects work done by Lucas' [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. The filmmakers consulted with [[Disney]]'s lawyers to make sure Howard didn't resemble the Disney character [[Donald Duck]] too closely. Howard's appearance was redesigned several times during the process, including his clothes and the shape of his bill.<ref name=\"Decider\" />\n\nThe film itself was adapted into comic book format by writer [[Danny Fingeroth]] and artist [[Kyle Baker]] for Marvel Comics. The adaptation appeared in both ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #41<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/42070/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Marvel Super Special #41 |work=comics.org|access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> and in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/3187/ ''Howard the Duck: The Movie''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter auditioning a number of actresses, singers, and models for the role of Beverly, [[Lea Thompson]] was cast in the role because of her appearance in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.<ref name = \"LookBack-1\"/> Thompson purchased clothing from thrift stores because she wanted to appear at the audition as \"a cross between [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].\" During the shoot, Thompson complained that the filmmakers chose to shoot Howard's closeup before hers. Thompson also states that she regrets not wearing a wig, as her hairstyle took two hours a day to prepare.<ref name = \"LookBack-2\" /> Jeffrey Jones was cast because of his performance in ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]''. Although Tim Robbins had not appeared in many films, Huyck and Katz were confident that he was right for the part.<ref name = \"LookBack-1\" />\n\nRobbins said in a later interview that he doesn't look back negatively at the film as he \"got this big job that was paying a really decent salary and it was for George Lucas...so it was a huge deal at the time.

The idea of fully puppeteering Howard was explored, but the filmmakers determined they would need an actor in a suit to portray him for much of the film.<ref name=\"Decider\" /> Lucasfilm built [[animatronic]] suits, costumes, and puppets. Because of the limited preparation time, varied \"ducks\" created for the film would explode or lose feathers, and multiple ducks were built with the wrong proportions. On the first day of shooting, the crew realized the poor quality of the effects when they found that the inside of the puppet's neck was visible when its mouth opened. Huyck repeatedly reshot scenes involving Howard as the animatronics were improved. Because multiple puppeteers were in charge of controlling different parts of the animatronic body, Huyck was unable to coordinate the shoot properly. The opening sequence where Howard's chair is propelled out of his apartment used wires that were later digitally erased by computer. This was the first use of this technique, which soon became popular and was used in films such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.<ref name = \"Wires\">{{cite web |last = Jensen |first = K.
