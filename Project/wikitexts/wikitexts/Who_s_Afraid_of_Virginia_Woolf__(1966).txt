The screenplay by [[Ernest Lehman]] is an adaptation of [[Edward Albee]]'s 1962 play [[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?|of the same name]]. It stars [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Martha, [[Richard Burton]] as George, [[George Segal]] as Nick, and [[Sandy Dennis]] as Honey. The film depicts a late-night gathering at the home of George, a college history professor, and his wife Martha, the daughter of the university's president. The guests are Nick, a new biology professor at the school, and his wife, Honey.\n\nThe film was nominated for 13 [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[Mike Nichols]]. It is one of only two films to be nominated in every eligible category at the Academy Awards (the other is ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]''). All four main actors were nominated in their respective acting categories, the first time a film's entire credited cast was nominated. The film won five Oscars, including a second [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for Taylor and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Dennis.\n\nIn 2013, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Paul |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/pulp-fiction-roger-me-mary-poppins-join-national-film-registry-1200969218/ |title='Pulp Fiction,' 'Roger & Me,' 'Mary Poppins' Join National Film Registry |website=Variety |date=December 17, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge, an associate professor of history at a small [[New England]] college, and his wife Martha, the daughter of the university president, return home drunk from a party. Martha has invited a young married couple she met at the party for a drink. The guests arrive\u2014Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey\u2014just before 2:30 A.M. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later entangled.\n\nMartha angers George by telling Honey about their son, who will celebrate his 16th birthday the next day. Martha's divulging of this information sets off another fight between the two. Nick confesses to George that he was attracted to Honey for her family's money and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and, years later, his father and lived out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start.\n\nWhen their guests propose leaving, a drunken George insists on driving them home. They approach a [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]], and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock and criticize George. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished novel, prompting George to attack Martha until Nick pulls him away from her. George tells the group about a second novel he has written about a teacher and his wife who marry because of her [[false pregnancy]] and family money. Honey realizes Nick told George about their past and runs from the room.\n\nAnother argument leads Martha to drive off with Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot, where he sees the shadows of Martha and Nick in the bedroom. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real and that she secretly had an [[abortion]]. He then devises a plan to get back at Martha.\n\nWhen Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his performance on the liquor he has consumed. Martha and George argue about their son and George announces he has received a telegram saying their son has been killed in a car accident.\n\nAs Martha begs George not to \"kill\" their son, Nick realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children and filled the void with an imaginary son. George explains that their one mutually agreed upon rule was to never mention the son to anyone else, and that he \"killed\" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey.\n\nThe young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. George starts singing the song \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", and Martha responds, \"I am, George, I am,\" while the two hold hands.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Martha\n* [[Richard Burton]] as George\n* [[George Segal]] as Nick\n* [[Sandy Dennis]] as Honey\n* [[Agnes Flanagan]] as Roadhouse Waitress\n* [[Frank Flanagan]] as Roadhouse Manager\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Edward Albee]]'s 1962 play was replete with dialogue that violated the [[Hays Code|standard moral guidelines for movies at the time]], including multiple instances of \"goddamn\" and \"son of a bitch\", along with \"screw you\", \"up yours\", \"monkey nipples\" and \"hump the hostess\".<ref name=Clooney89>Clooney, p. 89</ref> It opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and audiences who had gone to the theater to forget the threat of [[nuclear war]] were shocked by the provocative language and situations they had not seen before outside of [[experimental theater]].<ref>Clooney, p. 81</ref>\n\nThe immediate reaction of the theater audiences, eventually voiced by critics, was that Albee had created a play that would be a great success on Broadway, but could never be filmed in its current form. Neither the audience nor the critics understood how much the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] landscape was changing in the 1960s, and that it could no longer live with any meaningful [[Hays Code|Production Code]].<ref>Clooney, pp. 81\u201382</ref> In bringing the play to the screen, [[Ernest Lehman]] decided he would ''not'' change the dialogue that had shocked veteran theatergoers in New York only four years earlier. Despite serious opposition to this decision, Lehman prevailed.<ref name=\"Clooney85\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe choice of [[Elizabeth Taylor]]\u2014at the time regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world\u2014to play the frumpy, fifty-ish Martha surprised many, but the actress gained 30 pounds (13.5&nbsp;kg) for the role, and her performance (along with those of [[Richard Burton]], [[George Segal]], and [[Sandy Dennis]]) was ultimately praised. When [[Warner Bros.]] head [[Jack L. Warner]] approached Albee about buying the film rights for the play, he told Albee that he wanted to cast [[Bette Davis]] and [[James Mason]] in the roles of Martha and George.<ref name=Sikov>{{cite book |last1=Sikov |first1=Edward |title=Dark Victory: The Life of Bette Davis |year=2007 |publisher=Holt Paperbacks |location=New York |isbn=978-1429921954 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/darkvictorylifeo00edsi/page/364 364\u20135] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/darkvictorylifeo00edsi/page/364}}.</ref> In the script, Martha references Davis and quotes her famous \"What a dump!\" line from the film ''[[Beyond the Forest]]'' (1949). Albee was delighted by this cast, believing that \"James Mason seemed absolutely right...and to watch Bette Davis do that Bette Davis imitation in that first scene\u2014that would have been so wonderful\".<ref name=Sikov/> However, fearing that the talky, character-driven story would land with a resounding thud\u2014and that audiences would grow weary of watching two hours of screaming between a [[wikt:harridan|harridan]] and a wimp\u2014[[Mike Nichols|Nichols]] and Lehman cast stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.<ref name=Clooney85>{{cite book |last1=Clooney |first1=Nick |author-link1=Nick Clooney |title=The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen |date=November 2002 |publisher=Atria Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0743410434 |page=[https://archive.org/details/moviesthatchange00cloo/page/85 85] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/moviesthatchange00cloo/page/85}}.</ref> Edward Albee was surprised by the casting decision, but later stated that Taylor was quite good and Burton was incredible. In the end, though, he still felt that \"with Mason and Davis you would have had a less flashy and ultimately deeper film\".<ref name=Sikov/>\n\n===Filming===\nAs filming began, the Catholic Legion of Motion Pictures (formerly the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]]), issued a preliminary report that, if what they heard was true, they might have to issue ''Virginia Woolf'' with the once-dreaded \"condemned\" rating, although they promised to wait to see the film. The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) followed with an even stronger statement, warning the studio\u2014''without'' promising to wait for a screening\u2014that if they were really thinking of leaving the Broadway play's language intact, they could forget about getting a seal of approval.<ref name=\"Clooney89\" />\n\nMost of the film's exteriors were shot on location at [[Smith College]], [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Leavenworth |first=Jessica |title='Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'

At the time of the film's release, [[Warner Bros. Records]] released a [[gatefold]] two-LP record soundtrack album set that included the entire film's dialogue as the \"Deluxe Edition Two-Record Set\". The music was issued as a one-LP release that featured 11 tracks of North's score.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leonard |first=James |title=Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

The minor characters of the [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] owner, who has only a few lines of dialogue, and his wife, who serves a tray of drinks and leaves silently, were played by the film's [[Gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]], Frank Flanagan, and his wife, Agnes.\n\nThe play is set entirely in Martha and George's house. In the film, one scene takes place at the roadhouse, one in George and Martha's yard, and one in their car. Despite these minor deviations, however, the film is extremely faithful to the play. The filmmakers used the original play as the screenplay and, aside from toning down some of the profanity slightly\u2014Martha's \"Screw you!\" (which, in the 2005 Broadway revival, is \"Fuck you!\") becomes \"God damn you!\"\u2014virtually all of the original dialogue remains intact, although a major monologue by Martha is cut. (In the version released in the UK, \"Screw you\" is kept intact. In an interview at the time of the release, Taylor referred to this phrase as pushing boundaries.)\n\nNick is never referred to or addressed by name during the film or the play.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[Warner Bros.]] studio executives sat down to look at a rough cut, without music, and a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine reporter was present. He printed the following quote from one of the studio chiefs: \"My God! We've got a seven million dollar dirty movie on our hands!\"<ref name=\"Clooney89\" />\n\nThe film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual implication unheard of at that time.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Valenti |title=How It All Began |url=http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp |publisher=Motion Picture Association of America |access-date=2008-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521023225/http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_HowItAllBegan.asp |archive-date=2008-05-21}}</ref> [[Jack Valenti]], who had just become president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] in 1966, had arranged to update the old [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. For the film to be released with MPAA approval, Warner Bros. agreed to deletions of certain profanities and to have a special warning placed on all advertisements for the film, indicating adult content. In addition, all contracts with theatres exhibiting the film included a clause to prohibit anyone under 18 from admittance without adult supervision.<ref>{{cite news |title='Virginia Woolf' Not for Kids |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4PhRAAAAIBAJ&pg=6178,4267811 |access-date=February 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=May 27, 1966 |agency=[[United Press International]]}}</ref> Even the [[National Legion of Decency|National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures]] (NCOMP) refused to \"condemn\" the film,<ref name=\"Clooney89\" /> with the office ruling it \"morally unobjectionable for adults, with reservations\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Pennington |first=Jody |title=The History of Sex in American Film |url=https://archive.org/details/historysexameric00penn |url-access=limited |publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]] |location=Westport, CT |page=[https://archive.org/details/historysexameric00penn/page/n52 40] |date=July 30, 2007 |isbn=978-0275992262}}</ref> This film and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup|Blow-Up]]'' (1966) led Valenti to begin work on the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film rating system]] that went into effect on November 1, 1968.

wrote, \"''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' exists now as one of the seminal dramas of the modern screen. And its existence counterbalances every gauche public display the Burtons perpetrated, every ream of wasted newsprint devoted to their sometimes silly, outsized lives, and every mediocre film they made before and after its production. It is the peak of their collective and individual careers. And they would never recover from it.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25463/elizabeth-taylor-and-richard-burton-the-film-collection/| title=Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton: The Film Collection| website=DVD Talk| access-date=22 October 2015| archive-date=4 March 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075217/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25463/elizabeth-taylor-and-richard-burton-the-film-collection/| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1966]]\n* [[List of films with all four Academy Award acting nominations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0061184}}\n* {{Amg title|54412}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|95743}}\n* {{AFI film|22930}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|whos_afraid_of_virginia_woolf}}\n\n{{Mike Nichols |state=collapsed}}\n{{BAFTA Best Film 1961\u20131980}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1966 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1966 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1960s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Best Film BAFTA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films about marriage]]\n[[Category:Films about mental health]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Nichols]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ernest Lehman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alex North]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Costume Design Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ernest Lehman]]\n[[Category:Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
