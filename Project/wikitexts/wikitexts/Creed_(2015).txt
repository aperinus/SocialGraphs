Jordan]], Stallone, [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Tony Bellew]], and [[Graham McTavish]]. In the film, amateur boxer [[Donnie Creed]] (Jordan) is trained and mentored by [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone), the former rival turned friend of Adonis' father, [[Apollo Creed]].\n\nAlthough ''Rocky Balboa'' was considered the end of the franchise, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] hired Coogler in 2013 to develop a ''Rocky'' spin-off. Coogler and Covington's original screenplay was completed by April 2014, with the involvement of Jordan and Stallone also confirmed. The remaining cast were hired by January 2015, after which, [[principal photography]] began and lasted until that April, with filming locations including [[Liverpool]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].\n\n''Creed'' premiered on November 19, 2015, at the [[Regency Village Theater]] in Los Angeles, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 25, to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the date of the opening scene in the [[Rocky|first film]]. \nThe film was praised for Coogler's direction, the screenplay, and acting performances. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $173 million worldwide. Among its accolades, it was selected by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2015#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2015]], while Stallone won the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor|Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. The sequel, ''[[Creed II]]'', was released in 2018. A third film, ''[[Creed III]]'', is set to be released on March 3, 2023.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1998, [[Donnie Creed|Adonis \"Donnie\" Johnson]], the son of former heavyweight champion [[Apollo Creed]] via an extramarital affair, is serving time in a [[Los Angeles]] youth detention center when Creed's widow, Mary Anne, visits and offers to take him in.\nIn 2015, Donnie is in Tijuana, preparing for his fight in an amateur boxing bout hosted in a bar. Upon returning from his latest fight, Donnie resigns from the Smith Boardley Financial Group to pursue his dream of becoming a professional boxer. Donnie auditions at Los Angeles' elite Delphi Boxing Academy, managed by family friend [[List of Rocky characters#Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers, Jr|Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers Jr.]], the son of Apollo's trainer [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]], but is turned down. This rejection is further emphasized as Donnie is beaten in a sparring match by light heavyweight division #2 contender Danny \"The Stuntman\" Wheeler after he publicly challenges the whole gym to prove himself, betting his 1965 [[Ford Mustang]] that no one can get a clean head shot on him. Mary Anne vehemently opposes his aspirations, remembering how her husband was killed in the ring by [[Ivan Drago]] thirty years ago.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985).}} Undaunted, Donnie travels to [[Philadelphia]] in hopes of getting in touch with his father's old friend and rival, former heavyweight champion, [[Rocky Balboa]].\n\nDonnie meets Rocky at Rocky's Italian restaurant, Adrian's, named in honor of his [[Adrian Pennino|deceased wife]], and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant to return to boxing, having already made a one-off comeback{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006).}} at a very advanced age despite having suffered [[brain trauma]]{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990).}} during his career as a fighter. However, he eventually agrees. Donnie asks him about the \"secret third fight\" between him and Apollo just after Apollo helped Rocky regain the heavyweight title,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982).}} and Rocky reveals that Apollo won. Donnie trains at the Front Street Gym, with several of Rocky's longtime friends as [[cornermen]]. He also finds a love interest in Bianca, an up-and-coming singer and songwriter in the early stages of progressive hearing loss.\n\nDonnie, fighting under his biological mother's surname, Johnson, and the fight name \"Hollywood\", defeats local fighter Leo \"The Lion\" Sporino, which upsets the opposing corner. This leads to the opposing side leaking the news that Donnie is Creed's illegitimate son. Rocky receives a call from the handlers of world light heavyweight champion \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan, who is being forced into retirement by an impending prison term. He offers to make Donnie his final challenger\u2014provided that he legally change his surname to Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees.\n\nWhile helping Donnie train, Rocky is diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. He is unwilling to undergo [[chemotherapy]], remembering that it was not enough to save Adrian when she had [[ovarian cancer]]. His diagnosis and the fact that his best friend and brother-in-law [[Paulie Pennino]]\u2014Adrian's brother\u2014has now died in addition to Adrian, Apollo, and his old trainer, [[Mickey Goldmill]], further force him to confront his own mortality. Seeing Rocky shaken, Donnie urges him to seek treatment, which he does.\n\nDonnie fights Conlan at [[Goodison Park]] in Conlan's hometown of [[Liverpool]], and many parallels emerge between the bout that ensues and Apollo and Rocky's first fight{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976).}} forty years earlier. First, before entering the ring, Donnie receives a present from Mary Anne \u2014 new American flag trunks similar to the ones Apollo and later Rocky wore. Additionally, to the surprise of nearly everyone, Donnie gives Conlan all he can handle. Conlan knocks Donnie down, but Donnie recovers to knock Conlan down for the first time in his career. Donnie [[The distance (boxing)|goes the distance]], but Conlan wins on a [[split decision]]. However, Donnie has won the respect of Conlan and the crowd; as [[Max Kellerman]] puts it while calling the fight for [[HBO Sports|HBO]], \"Ricky Conlan won the fight, but Adonis Creed won the night.\" Conlan tells Donnie that he is the future of the [[Light heavyweight#Boxing|light heavyweight division]].\n\nThe film ends with Donnie and a frail but improving Rocky climbing the [[Rocky Steps|72 steps]] outside the entrance of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Rocky characters}}\n* [[Michael B.
