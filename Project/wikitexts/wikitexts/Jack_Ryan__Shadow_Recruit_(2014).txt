It is the fifth film in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|''Jack Ryan'' series]] and the second [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] thereof. Unlike its predecessors, it is not an adaptation of a particular Clancy novel, but rather an original story. [[Chris Pine]] stars in the title role, becoming the [[Jack Ryan (film series)#Cast|fourth actor]] to play Ryan, following [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Ben Affleck]]. The film is directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], who also stars alongside [[Kevin Costner]], and [[Keira Knightley]].\n\nThe original screenplay was written by Adam Cozand and [[David Koepp]]. The film was produced by [[Mace Neufeld]], [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]], [[David Barron (film producer)|David Barron]] and Mark Vahradian, with [[David Ellison]], Dana Goldberg, Paul Schwake and Tommy Harper as executive producers. The [[film score]] was composed by [[Patrick Doyle]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 17, 2014. It grossed over $130 million and was met with mixed critical reviews. It is dedicated to Clancy, who died on October 1, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], studying at the [[London School of Economics]], becomes a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] officer. While serving [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u201314)|in Afghanistan]], the helicopter he is in with two other soldiers is hit. Despite suffering severe damage to his spine, he was helping the youngest of the three strap in and was thrown throughout the cabin, Jack successfully pulls out both men, saving their lives. However, his injury ends his military career. During a lengthy recovery back in the United States, he meets Cathy Muller, a medical student helping him to recover. Later, Thomas Harper, a veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official, recruits Jack.\n\nTen years later, Ryan is working on [[Wall Street]] covertly for the CIA looking for suspicious financial transactions that indicate terrorist activity. He is also shown to be in a long-term relationship with Muller. When [[Russia]] loses a key vote before the [[United Nations]] and the markets do not respond as expected, Ryan discovers that billions of dollars possessed by Russian business interests have disappeared. Most of the missing funds belong directly or indirectly to Russian oligarch Viktor Cherevin.\n\nRyan's employer conducts business with one of Cherevin's businesses. When Ryan finds certain accounts inaccessible to him as an auditor, he uses it as a legitimate excuse to visit [[Moscow]] and investigate. After narrowly surviving an attempt on his life by the man hired to be his bodyguard, Ryan contacts the CIA for backup. He is surprised that his backup is Harper. During their debrief at [[Staraya Square]], Ryan explains how Cherevin's web of international investments make the United States vulnerable to complete [[Economic collapse|financial collapse]] following a staged terrorist attack.\n\nAt his meeting with Cherevin the next day, he is told that the problem company and all its assets have just been sold, preventing an audit. Meanwhile, Muller, now Ryan's fianc\u00e9e, suspects that he is having an affair and flies to Moscow. Against protocol for unmarried couples, Ryan reveals his CIA employment. Improvising on the situation, Harper convinces Muller to help them infiltrate Cherevin's offices. Ryan and Muller meet Cherevin at an upscale restaurant across the street from the office and Muller lures Cherevin away so Ryan can leave without suspicion. Excusing himself, he accesses Cherevin's computer and downloads crucial files. While Muller remains with Cherevin, she notices symptoms that reveal he is terminally ill.\n\nRyan and the CIA discover Cherevin has secretly propped up the struggling Chinese and Japanese state economies for years, leaving the U.S. economy vulnerable, as well as using a falsified death certificate to place his son, Aleksandr, in the U.S. as a [[sleeper agent]]. Ryan uses his talent for pattern recognition to determine that Aleksandr will execute a terrorist attack on Wall Street. Returning to [[New York City]], he locates and pursues a fake police response vehicle driven by Aleksandr. After Ryan catches up and engages in a physical confrontation with Aleksandr, he discovers a bomb in the rear of the vehicle. Unable to defuse it, he hijacks the vehicle and crashes it into the [[East River]] while jumping out, leaving Aleksandr to die. Cherevin's fellow conspirators kill him to cover their tracks. Afterwards, Ryan, now married, and Harper are called to the [[White House]] to brief the [[President of the United States|President]] on their next move.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Chris Pine 2, 2013.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Chris Pine]] became the fourth actor to assume the role of [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], following [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Ben Affleck]].]]\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Dr. Catherine \"Cathy\" Muller\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Thomas Harper\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Viktor Cherevin\n* [[Lenn Kudrjawizki]] as Konstantin \n* [[Alec Utgoff]] as Aleksandr Borovsky\n* [[Elena Velikanova]] as Katya\n* [[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Dimitri Lemkov\n* [[Nonso Anozie]]<ref name=empire>{{cite news | url = https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=38948 | title = Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit Trailer Jumps In | date = October 4, 2013 | first = James | last = White | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | access-date = 2014-01-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011315/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=38948 | archive-date = October 5, 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref> as Embee Deng \n* [[Colm Feore]]<ref name=empire/> as Rob Behringer.
