It premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York City on April 26, 2009. The title refers to the [[The Bronx|Bronx's]] [[City Island, New York|City Island]], where the film is set.\n\n==Plot==\nLiving on [[City Island, New York|City Island]], in [[the Bronx]], Vince Rizzo, a [[prison guard]], is the father of a dysfunctional family whose members all have secrets. Vince discovers that his secret [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] is now the 24-year-old prison inmate Tony Nardella who is being held in the same prison where he works. Without revealing this truth to his family, Vince consequently gets Tony out of prison and employs him as hired help at his own home in order to become closer with his unknowing son. Vince has also been secretly taking acting lessons, taught by Michael Malakov, and begins to form a [[Platonic love|platonic bond]] with Molly, an aspiring actress.\n\nMeanwhile, Vince's 20-year-old daughter Vivian (played by the real-life daughter of her on-screen father) has not told her family that she has been suspended from college, lost her scholarship, gotten [[breast implant]]s, and become a stripper to try to pay for her next semester; their youngest teenage child, Vinnie, has a secret [[sexual fetish]] for [[feederism|feeding large women]], and fantasizes about their fat next-door neighbor; and Vince's wife, Joyce, thinking she has lost all marital intimacy, sexually pursues Tony without realizing that he is her stepson.\n\nVince successfully auditions for a part in a [[Martin Scorsese]] film, while his wife and Tony seek each other's sexual attention. Vince, Jr. befriends the neighbor, who helps to bring him closer to an overweight girl whom he has been attracted to at school.\n\nTensions rise as the family's many dysfunctions come to a head. Tony, finally deciding to escape the insanity of the Rizzo household, steals their car but finds Vivian working at the strip club. Just before the group is nearly torn apart in a violent outburst, Vince reveals the truth about everything, with Tony discovering in amazement that the dysfunctional family he sought to escape is actually his own. Vivian and the others admit their faults and Vince acknowledges the family's problems with the desire to work them out. The finally relieved group reunites in forgiveness toward one another, welcoming the overwhelmed Tony as a new member of their bizarre but loving family. Vince lands the film role.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Vince Rizzo\n* [[Julianna Margulies]] as Joyce Rizzo\n* [[Steven Strait]] as Tony\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Molly\n* [[Ezra Miller]] as Vince Jr.\n* [[Dominik Garc\u00eda-Lorido]] as Vivian Rizzo\n* Carrie Baker Reynolds as Denise\n* Hope Glendon-Ross as Cheryl\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Michael Malakov\n\n==Reception==\n''City Island'' received generally positive reviews.
