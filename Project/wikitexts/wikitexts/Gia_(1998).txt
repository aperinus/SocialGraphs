The film stars [[Angelina Jolie]] as Gia and [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], with [[Mercedes Ruehl]] and [[Elizabeth Mitchell]]. It was directed by [[Michael Cristofer]] and written by Cristofer and [[Jay McInerney]]. The original music score was composed by [[Terence Blanchard]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gia Carangi]] is a [[Philadelphia]] native who moves to New York City to become a fashion model, and immediately catches the attention of powerful agent [[Wilhelmina Cooper]]. Gia's attitude and beauty help her rise quickly to the forefront of the modeling industry, but her persistent loneliness, especially after the death of Wilhelmina, drives her to use mood-altering drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]].\n\nShe becomes entangled in a passionate affair with Linda, a make-up artist. Their love affair first starts when both pose nude for a photo shoot and make love afterward. Gia tries to get clean and begins taking [[methadone]]. However, Gia eventually starts using again, and Linda gives her an ultimatum. Gia chooses the drugs.\n\nFailed attempts at reconciliation with Linda and with her mother, Kathleen, drive Gia back to heroin. Although she is eventually able to break her drug habit after much effort, she has already contracted [[HIV]] from intravenous drug use, which has progressed to AIDS. She spends the remainder of her life in the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Gia Carangi]]\n** [[Mila Kunis]] as Gia Carangi (at age 11)\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Wilhelmina Cooper]]\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Kathleen Carangi, Gia's mother\n* [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Linda\n* [[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]] as Mike Mansfield\n* [[Kylie Travis]] as Stephanie\n* Edmund Genest as [[Francesco Scavullo]]\n* [[Alexander Enberg]] as [[Chris von Wangenheim]]\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Joseph Carangi\n* [[Eric Michael Cole]] as T.J.\n* [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]] as Bruce Cooper\n* [[James Haven]] as young man on Sansom street\n* [[Rick Batalla]] as Phillipe\n* [[Brian Donovan (actor)|Brian Donovan]] as junkie at Shooting Gallery\n* [[Tricia O'Neil]] as Vogue editor\n* [[Sam Pancake]] as Francesco stylist #1\n* [[Adina Porter]] as Girl at Group Therapy\n* [[Michael E.
