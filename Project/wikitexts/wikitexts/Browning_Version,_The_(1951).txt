It was directed by [[Anthony Asquith]] and starred [[Michael Redgrave]]. In 1994, [[The Browning Version (1994 film)|a remake]] was made starring [[Albert Finney]].\n\n==Plot==\nAndrew Crocker-Harris is an ageing [[Classics]] [[Schoolmaster|master]] at an English [[Public school (England)|public school]], and is forced into retirement by his increasing ill health. The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final few days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realisation that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school.\n\nThe emotional turning-point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, [[Robert Browning]]'s translation of the ''[[Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master.\"\n\n===Differences between play and film===\nRattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends on Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with enthusiastic applause and cheers by the boys. The film ends with a conversation between Crocker-Harris and Taplow, and the suggestion that Crocker-Harris will complete his translation of the ''Agamemnon''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Redgrave]] as Andrew Crocker-Harris\n* [[Jean Kent]] as his wife Millie\n* [[Nigel Patrick]] as her lover Frank Hunter, Andrew's fellow schoolmaster who eventually rejects Millie for her cruelty towards her husband\n* [[Ronald Howard (British actor)|Ronald Howard]] as Gilbert, Crocker-Harris's successor\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as the Headmaster\n* Brian Smith as Taplow\n* [[Bill Travers]] as Fletcher\n* [[Judith Furse]] as Mrs. Williamson\n* [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] as Carstairs\n* [[Sarah Lawson (actress)|Sarah Lawson]] as Betty Carstairs\n* Scott Harold as Rev.
