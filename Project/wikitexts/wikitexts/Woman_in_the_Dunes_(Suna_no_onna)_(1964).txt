It received positive critical reviews and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. The screenplay for the film was adapted by [[K\u014db\u014d Abe]] from his [[The Woman in the Dunes|1962 novel]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=208}}\n\n==Plot==\n\nSchool teacher and amateur entomologist Niki Junpei leaves Tokyo on a beach expedition to collect [[tiger beetles]] and other insects that live in sandy soil. After a long day of searching, Junpei misses the last bus ride back to town. A village elder and some of his fellow local villagers suggest that he stay the night at their village. Junpei agrees and is guided down a rope ladder to a hut at the bottom of a sand dune, the home of a young woman. Junpei learns that she lost her husband and daughter in a sandstorm a year ago and now lives alone; their bodies are said to be buried under the sand somewhere near the hut. After dinner, the woman goes outside to shovel the sand into buckets, which the villagers reel in from the top of the dune. Junpei offers to help but she refuses, telling him that he is a guest and there is no need for him to help on the first day.\n\nThe next morning, Junpei gets ready to leave as he must return to his job in Tokyo, but finds that the rope ladder has been pulled up. Unable to escape as the sand surrounding the hut is too steep and does not give him enough grip to climb up, he quickly realises that he is trapped and expected to live with the woman and assist her in digging sand, which is sold to cement manufacturers, in exchange for food and water. Junpei begrudgingly accepts his role, which the woman has long accepted without question.\n\nJunpei becomes the widow's lover but hopes to escape from the dune. One evening, using an improvised grappling hook, he escapes from the sand dune and runs away, the villagers in pursuit. Junpei is unfamiliar with the geography of the area and becomes trapped in [[quicksand]]. The villagers free him and return him to the hut.\n\nEventually, Junpei resigns himself to his situation but requests time to see the nearby sea; in exchange, he needs to have sex with the woman while the villagers watch. Junpei agrees but she refuses and fends him off. Through his persistent effort to trap a crow as a messenger, he discovers a way to draw water from the damp sand at night by [[capillary action]] and becomes absorbed in perfecting the technique. When it is discovered that the woman is ill from an [[ectopic pregnancy]], the villagers take her to a doctor, leaving the rope ladder down when they go. Junpei instead chooses to stay, telling himself that he can still attempt to escape after showing the villagers his method of water production. The film's final shot is of a police report that shows that Junpei has been missing for seven years and declared as having disappeared.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eiji Okada]] as Niki Junpei, an amateur entomologist and school-teacher from Tokyo. Okada was cast in various Japanese films in the 1950s, but it was not until he appeared in [[Alain Resnais]]'s 1959 film about the aftermath of the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] that he gained a worldwide reputation. He has been in over 130 films in his lifetime, best known for his roles in ''[[Hiroshima Mon Amour]]'' (1959); ''Woman in the Dunes''; and ''The Boy Detectives Club - The Iron Fiend'' (1957).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/05/obituaries/eiji-okada-75-japanese-co-star-of-hiroshima-mon-amour.html|title = Eiji Okada, 75, Japanese Co-Star of 'Hiroshima, Mon Amour'|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 5 October 1995|last1 = Sullivan|first1 = Ronald}}</ref>\n* [[Ky\u014dko Kishida]] as the widow in the dunes. Kishida was a Japanese actress, voice actress, and writer of children's books. She was best known for ''Woman in the Dunes''; ''Ninja, a Band of Assassins'' (1962); and ''An Autumn Afternoon'' (1962). She was a founding member of the theater group Engeki Shudan En (formed in 1975).\n* [[K\u014dji Mitsui]] as the village elder who lures the entomologist to the widow's home. Mitsui was a popular character actor and favorite of [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu|Ozu]] and [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], well-remembered for his award-winning performance in the latter's ''[[The Lower Depths (1957 film)|The Lower Depths]]''. The actor was billed above the film's title on the original ''Woman in the Dunes'' film poster, alongside Okada and Kishida, including the standard studio-era convention of appending his name with small characters indicating that Toho had borrowed the contracted player from [[Shochiku]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Woman in the Dunes (1964)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058625/mediaviewer/rm464925952|website=IMDb|publisher=imdb.com|access-date=11 March 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nPrior to the production of ''Woman in the Dunes'', Hiroshi Teshigahara directed {{nihongo|''Pitfall''|\u304a\u3068\u3057\u7a74|Otoshiana}}, a.k.a.
