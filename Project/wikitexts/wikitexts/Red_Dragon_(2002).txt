It was directed by [[Brett Ratner]] and written by [[Ted Tally]]. A prequel to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), it sees [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] ([[Edward Norton]]) enlisting the help of serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]] ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) to catch another killer, [[Francis Dolarhyde]] ([[Ralph Fiennes]]). [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Emily Watson]], [[Mary-Louise Parker]], and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] also star.\n\nThe novel was previously adapted into the film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986). Both films feature the same cinematographer, [[Dante Spinotti]]. After turning down the ''Silence of the Lambs'' sequel, ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001)'','' ''Silence of the Lambs'' screenwriter [[Ted Tally]] returned to write ''Red Dragon.'' It was released on October 4, 2002 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, earning $209 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1980, FBI agent [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] visits forensic psychiatrist [[Hannibal Lecter]] to discuss a case. Graham has been working with Lecter on a [[Offender profiling|psychological profile]] of a [[serial killer]] who removes edible body parts from his victims; Graham says he has realized the killer is a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]]. Realizing Graham is close to discovering he is the killer, Lecter stabs him, but Graham fights back, stabbing and shooting Lecter before they both fall unconscious. Lecter is imprisoned in an institution for the [[criminally insane]], and Graham, traumatized, retires to Florida with his family.\n\nYears later, another serial killer, nicknamed the Tooth Fairy, has killed two families{{snd}}the Jacobis' and The Leeds'{{snd}}during full moons. With another full moon approaching, special agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] persuades Graham to help develop the killer's profile. After visiting the crime scenes in Atlanta, Georgia, and Birmingham, Alabama, and speaking with Crawford, Graham concludes that he must consult Lecter. Lecter taunts Graham but agrees to help.\n[[File:Brooklyn_Museum_-_The_Great_Red_Dragon_and_the_Woman_Clothed_with_the_Sun_(Rev._12_1-4)_-_William_Blake.jpg|right|thumb|''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun'', ca. 1803\u20131805 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nThe Tooth Fairy is [[Francis Dolarhyde]], who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the Great Red Dragon, named after the [[William Blake]] painting ''[[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun]]'', which he has tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the Dragon, as his psychopathology originates from his childhood abuse by his grandmother.\n\n[[Freddy Lounds]], a tabloid reporter for the ''National Tattler'' who hounded Graham after Lecter's capture, pursues Graham for leads on the Tooth Fairy. A letter from the Tooth Fairy is discovered hidden in Lecter's cell, expressing admiration for Lecter and an interest in Graham and suggesting that Lecter reply through the [[Personal advertisement|personals]] section of the ''Tattler'', which he does with Graham's home address, forcing Graham's wife, Molly, and son, Josh, to relocate. While in hiding, Graham teaches Molly how to properly fire a handgun.\n\nHoping to lure out the Tooth Fairy, Graham gives an interview to Lounds in which Graham disparages the killer as an impotent homosexual. An enraged Dolarhyde kidnaps Lounds, glues him to an antique wheelchair, and reveals himself as the Great Red Dragon before showing Lounds first-person pictures he has taken of his victims before and after he murdered them. Dolarhyde then forces Lounds to recant his allegations on tape and then bites off his lips. Dolarhyde then sets Lounds and the wheelchair on fire and sends him rolling and crashing into a company sign outside the ''Tattler'' offices.\n\nAt his job in a St. Louis photo lab, Dolarhyde gives Reba McClane, a blind co-worker, a ride to her home and they begin a relationship. However, his alternate personality demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon's control over him, Dolarhyde goes to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], tears apart the Blake painting, and eats it.\n\nGraham realizes that the Tooth Fairy knew the layout of his victims' houses from their home videos. He deduces that he works for the company that edits the home movies and transfers them to video. He visits the company processing plant to ask for information, and is spotted by Dolarhyde as he returns from Brooklyn.\n\nIn a panic, Dolarhyde goes to Reba's house. She has spent the evening with a co-worker, Ralph Mandy. After Reba enters her home, Dolarhyde kills Ralph, kidnaps Reba, takes her to his house, and sets it ablaze. Unable to shoot her, Dolarhyde apparently shoots himself. Reba escapes as the police arrive.\n\nAfter an autopsy is performed on the corpse, it is revealed that Dolarhyde used Ralph's body to stage his death. Dolarhyde later infiltrates Graham's home in Florida and takes Josh hostage, threatening to kill him. To save Josh, Graham loudly insults him, reminding Dolarhyde of his grandmother's abuse and provoking him to furiously attack Graham. Both are severely wounded in a shootout, which ends when Molly kills Dolarhyde.\n\nGraham survives and receives a letter from Lecter praising his work and bidding him well. Lecter's jailer, Dr. [[Frederick Chilton]], tells him that he has a visitor, a young woman from the FBI.{{efn|Which sets up the events of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).}} <!-- Do NOT add Clarice Starling without a reliable source.

Hopkins was the only major member of the ''Silence of the Lambs'' team to return for the 2001 sequel, ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]''; it was also a commercial success, but received less positive reviews.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg|date=October 3, 2002|title=Marquee names serve up another helping of Hannibal|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002-10-03-red-dragon-cover_x.htm|access-date=November 2, 2020|newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> Both films were adapted from novels by [[Thomas Harris]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHusband-and-wife producers [[Dino De Laurentiis|Dino]] and [[Martha De Laurentiis]] decided to produce a film based on the 1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]],'' the first Hannibal Lecter novel, as a prequel to ''The Silence of the Lambs.''<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=French|first=Philip|date=October 12, 2002|title=Film of the week: Red Dragon|language=en-GB|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/oct/13/features.review27|access-date=November 13, 2020|issn=0029-7712}}</ref> Dino said that people thought he was \"crazy\" for adapting the book, as it had been previously adapted as [[Manhunter (film)|''Manhunter'']] (1986), with [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Lecter.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both ''Manhunter'' and ''Red Dragon'' had the same cinematographer, [[Dante Spinotti]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHopkins hesitated to sign on, worried that three Lecter films might be too much. Screenwriter [[Ted Tally]], who wrote ''The Silence of the Lambs'' but not ''Hannibal'', had turned down many offers to write more serial killer stories. He said he liked the idea of Hopkins' Lecter films forming a trilogy: \"If it ends here, it will end gracefully. I would hate to see this become ''Hannibal Lecter XIII''.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> To satisfy expectations, Tally added Lecter scenes not in the novel, describing it as a \"commercial reality\". He had the support of Harris, who sent Tally dialogue and ideas for scenes.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Edward Norton]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]] admired ''The Silence of the Lambs'' but had not enjoyed ''Hannibal.'' The cast were persuaded to join by Tally's screenplay; Fiennes felt it worked \"only on suspense\", without overt violence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNorton and Ratner disagreed on the scene in which Graham approaches the incarcerated Lecter for the first time. Ratner wanted Norton to incorporate a gesture or look to indicate Graham's fear, but Norton felt the audience would not need this if it were filmed correctly. They compromised by showing Graham's sweat stains when he removes his jacket in the next scene.<ref name=\":0\" /> Whereas Fiennes wanted to avoid overplaying his serial killer character, Hopkins aimed to play Lecter with more \"danger and rage\" than before.<ref name=\":0\" /> Fiennes spent 90 minutes of each day for months building his physique, and wore a prosthetic to give him a [[cleft palate]].
