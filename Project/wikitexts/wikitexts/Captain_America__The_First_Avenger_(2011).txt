During [[World War II]], Steve Rogers, a frail man, is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]] (Weaving) from using the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]] as an energy source for world domination.\n\nThe film began as a concept in 1997 and was scheduled for distribution by [[Artisan Entertainment]]. However, a lawsuit disrupted the project and was not settled until September 2003. In 2005, Marvel Studios received a loan from [[Merrill Lynch]], and planned to finance and release the film through Paramount Pictures. Directors [[Jon Favreau]] and [[Louis Leterrier]] were interested in directing the project before Johnston was approached in 2008. The principal characters were cast between March and June 2010. Production began in June, and filming took place in [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[Caerwent]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Los Angeles]]. Several different techniques were used by the visual effects company [[Lola Visual Effects|Lola]] to create the physical appearance of the character before he becomes Captain America.\n\n''Captain America: The First Avenger'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on July 19, 2011, and was released in the United States on July 22, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $370 million worldwide. Critics particularly praised Evans' performance, the film's depiction of its 1940s time period, and Johnston's direction. Two sequels have been released: ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nIn the present day, scientists in the [[Arctic]] uncover an old, frozen aircraft. In March 1942, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] lieutenant general [[Johann Schmidt (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Johann Schmidt]] and his men steal a mysterious relic called the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]],{{refn|1 = Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract of the films is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] of the comics.<ref name=\"MLCC\" /> After ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', he further stated it was also the [[Space Stone]].<ref name=\"SpaceStone\" />|name = Tesseract|group = N}} which possesses untold godly powers, from the town of [[T\u00f8nsberg]] in [[German occupation of Norway|German-occupied Norway]].\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] is rejected for [[World War II]] military recruitment due to his various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his best friend, Sgt. [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James \"Bucky\" Barnes]], Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about representing his country in the war, Dr. [[Abraham Erskine (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Abraham Erskine]] allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a [[Project Rebirth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|\"super-soldier\" experiment]] under Erskine, Colonel [[Chester Phillips (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chester Phillips]], and British MI6 agent [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]]. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers [[falling on a grenade|jump on a grenade]] to save his comrades, unaware that it is a test. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent the procedure prematurely and suffered permanent side-effects.\n\nSchmidt and Dr. [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]] harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskine's location and sends assassin [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: A\u2013L#Heinz Kruger|Heinz Kruger]] to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with \"vita-rays\". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees with a vial of the serum. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a [[cyanide]] capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as \"Captain America\" to promote [[War Bond|war bonds]] while scientists study him and attempt to [[reverse-engineer]] the formula. In 1943, while on tour in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes' unit was [[Missing in action|MIA]] in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard Stark]] fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] division, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the [[sobriquet]] \"the Red Skull\". Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.\n\nRogers recruits Barnes, [[Dum Dum Dugan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Gabe Jones (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gabe Jones]], [[Jim Morita (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jim Morita]], [[Union Jack (James Montgomery Falsworth)|James Montgomery Falsworth]], and [[Jacques Dernier]] to attack other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a [[Captain America's shield (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|circular shield]] made of [[Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|vibranium]], a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations, while he and Carter begin to fall in love. In 1945, the team assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death.{{refn|Speaking together, with some crosstalk, [[Joe Johnston]], [[Shelly Johnson (cinematographer)|Shelly Johnson]], and [[Jeffrey Ford (film editor)|Jeffrey Ford]] said on the audio commentary that the experiments performed by Zola enabled Barnes to survive the fall shown in the film.<ref name=\"DVD\" />|group=N}} Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Valkyrie|Schmidt's aircraft]] as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to be sucked into a portal into space. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers radios Carter and says goodbye to her before crashing in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.\n\nRogers awakens in a 1940s-styled hospital room. Hearing a radio broadcast of a baseball game that he attended in 1941, Rogers grows suspicious, flees outside and finds himself in present-day [[Times Square]], where [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] informs him that he has been \"asleep\" for nearly 70 years.

If the movie hits, I'm f\u2014-ed!' I was just scared. I realized my whole decision-making process was fear-based, and you never want to make a decision out of fear.

But more importantly she's a modern woman and she sees something in Captain America that she relates to, and becomes kindred spirits.

About his preparation for the role, Choi said, \"[I] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the '[[Nisei]]' soldiers, or Japanese-American soldiers. I wanted to get as much true, real-life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII. I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him, I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe, which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances.\"<ref name=\"Choi\" /> Bruno Ricci stars as [[Jacques Dernier]], a French member of Rogers' squad of commandos.

The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003.<ref name=\"Development4\" /> Following the settlement, Marvel was preparing to license the film rights to [[Warner Bros.]] until producer [[David Maisel]] suggested that the company produce the film themselves.<ref name=\"Development18\" /> In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from [[Merrill Lynch]], allowing them to independently produce ten films, including ''Captain America''. [[Paramount Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film.<ref name=\"Development3\" /><ref name=\"Development5\" /><ref name=\"Development6\" />\nOriginally, the film would stand alone; producer Kevin Feige said \"about half\" the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day.<ref name=\"IGN.com\" /> Producer [[Avi Arad]] said, \"The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?\" He cited the [[Back to the Future (franchise)#Films|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]] as an influence, and claimed he had \"someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director\".<ref name=\"Development7\" /> In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date.<ref name=\"Development8\" /> [[Jon Favreau]] approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' instead.<ref name=\"Development9\" /> In April 2006, [[David Self]] was hired to write the script.<ref name=\"Self\" /> He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because \"my dad told me I could one day be Captain America\".<ref name=\"Development10\" /> [[Joe Johnston]] met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.<ref name=\"Johnston\" />\n\n''Captain America'' was put on hold during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]].

''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.<ref name=\"Development15\" />\n\nWhen asked whether anti-US sentiments would affect the film's box office, Feige said, \"Marvel is perceived pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office would be a good thing.&nbsp;... We have to deal with much the same way that Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize,\" similar to the way Stan Lee and [[Jack Kirby]] reintroduced the character in the 1960s.<ref name=\"IGN.com\" /> Likewise, Arad noted, \"Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [on] that basis it will be very successful.\"<ref name=\"Development16\" /> Later, after the election of US President [[Barack Obama]], Feige commented, \"The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood.

Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was \"called the [[Howling Commandos]] in the script, but no one says that out loud\".<ref name=\"newsday\" />\n\nThe design as a whole tried to create technology that could be built in the 1940s, though with the added Cube technology in Hydra's case. Abandoned Nazi projects or actual vehicles from the period were used as inspiration. [[Daniel Simon]], who was previously responsible for many vehicle designs in ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'',<ref name=\"SimonL.A.Times\" /> was appointed Lead Vehicle Designer.<ref name=\"Blu-ray DVD\" /> Director Johnston cited Simon's book ''Cosmic Motors'' as a reason to trust his influence, saying \"he's sort of the guy I wanted to be when I was designing stuff for ''Star Wars''\".<ref name=\"SlashFilm\" /> The Red Skull's car, for instance, was based on two [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles from the 1930s, the [[Mercedes-Benz 540K|540K]] and the [[Mercedes-Benz W31|G4]].<ref name=\"Blu-ray DVD\" />\n\nIn March 2010, it was reported that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull;<ref name=\"EvansWeavingConfirmed\" /> Marvel Studios confirmed the latter in May.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[John Krasinski]] were also considered for the role of Captain America.<ref name=\"PhillippeKrasinski\" /> In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role, was cast as Bucky Barnes.

Whedon said in August, \"I just got to make some character connections. The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it, but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit \u2014and some of the other characters' \u2014 and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be.

Nevertheless, he said he believes 3-D is \"a new challenge and it's exciting\". Feige insisted that the conversion would not compromise the film's image quality, as the decision to release the film in 3-D was made early in development, and that \"an unprecedented amount of time\" would be devoted to the conversion process, to render all the film's [[visual effects]] in true 3-D.<ref name=\"3D\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n[[File:Chris Evans body reduction VFX in Captain America The First Avenger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Evans as pre-serum [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] before (top) and after (bottom) he was visually reduced]]\nIn November 2010, Stanley Tucci stated that he had completed filming his scenes and that the rest of the production would wrap in about three weeks.<ref name=\"PoPro1\" /> In February 2011, it was announced that [[Alan Silvestri]] had been chosen to compose the [[film score]].<ref name=\"PoPro2\" /> In March 2011, it was reported that ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' would be undergoing reshoots in the United Kingdom and in Los Angeles in April 2011.<ref name=\"PoPro3\" /><ref name=\"PoPro4\" /> A scene was also filmed in New York City's Times Square on April 23, 2011.<ref name=\"PoPro5\" />\n\nThe film features nearly 1,600 visual effects shots, which were split between thirteen different companies.<ref name=\"CGSociety\" /> To achieve the appearance of the skinny, pre-serum Steve Rogers, director Joe Johnston stated that he used two major techniques:\n{{blockquote|text=Most of the shots were done by an L.A. company called LOLA that specializes in digital \"plastic surgery.\" The technique involved shrinking Chris in all dimensions. We shot each skinny Steve scene at least four times; once like a normal scene with Chris and his fellow actors in the scene, once with Chris alone in front of a green screen so his element could be reduced digitally, again with everyone in the scene but with Chris absent so that the shrunken Steve could be re-inserted into the scene, and finally with a body double mimicking Chris's actions in case the second technique were required. When Chris had to interact with other characters in the scene, we had to either lower Chris or raise the other actors on apple boxes or elevated walkways to make skinny Steve shorter in comparison. For close-ups, Chris' fellow actors had to look at marks on his chin that represented where his eyes would be after the shrinking process, and Chris had to look at marks on the tops of the actor's head to represent their eyes. ... The second technique involved grafting Chris's head onto the body double. This technique was used mostly when Chris was sitting or lying down, or when a minimum of physical acting was required....<ref name=\"PoPro7\" />}}\n\nCaptain America's shield, which serves as both a defensive tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, [[fiberglass]], rubber, and [[computer graphics]] (CG).<ref name=\"CGSociety\" /> Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that \"We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [and] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.&nbsp;... And then we had a stunt shield made of [[polyurethane]], which is sort of a synthetic rubber&nbsp;... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [Evans'] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him.\"<ref name=\"newsday\" /> Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans \"would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield\".<ref name=\"CGSociety\" />\n\nHugo Weaving, who portrayed the Red Skull, wore a latex mask conceived by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky and they wanted to make it look like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.<ref name=\"CGSociety\" />\n\n[[Closing credits]] were created by visual effects firm Rok!t by means of 3-D and stereoscopic processing that used iconic American war propaganda, such as [[James Montgomery Flagg]]'s [[Uncle Sam]] recruitment poster from World War&nbsp;I and [[J.

Many international distributors chose to retain the original title, believing the franchise name to be more identifiable than the alternative, and that the latter would risk losing ticket sales.
