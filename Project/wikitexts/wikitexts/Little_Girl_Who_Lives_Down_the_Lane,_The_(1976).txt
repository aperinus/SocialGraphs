It was a co-production of Canada and France and written by [[Laird Koenig]], based on his [[The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (novel)|1974 novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on 13-year-old Rynn Jacobs (Foster), a child whose absent poet father and secretive behaviours prod the suspicions of her conservative small-town Maine neighbours. The adaptation, originally intended as a play, was filmed in Quebec on a small budget. The production later became the subject of controversy over reports that Foster had conflicts with producers over the filming and inclusion of a nude scene, but a 21-year-old body double (Foster's sister) was used. After a screening at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]], a court challenge was launched regarding distribution, and a general release followed in 1977.\n\nInitially released to mixed reviews, with some critics finding the murder mystery plot weak but Jodie Foster's performance more meritorious, the film won two [[5th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Foster. It subsequently attained [[cult film|cult status]], with later critics positively reviewing the screenplay. Writers and academics have interpreted it as a statement on [[children's rights]] and variously placed it in the thriller, horror, mystery or other genres.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Halloween|Halloween night]], in the seaside town of Wells Harbor, Maine, Rynn Jacobs celebrates her thirteenth birthday alone. She and her father, Lester Jacobs, a poet, had recently moved to the village from England. Frank Hallet, adult son of their landlady Cora Hallet, visits unexpectedly and, finding her alone, makes unwelcome sexual advances toward Rynn.\n\nThe following day Cora Hallet comes to the house, first obtrusively poking around the garden, then coming inside and aggressively probing Rynn with pointed questions about herself and her father. Rynn says he is in New York with his publisher and taunts the landlady about her son's intentions. The situation becomes more tense when Mrs. Hallet insists on retrieving jelly glasses she left in the cellar. Rynn makes it obvious she is unwilling to let her landlady go down into the cellar, and Mrs. Hallet finally leaves.  She returns later and opens the cellar trapdoor over Rynn's objections. Upset by what she sees there, Mrs. Hallet attempts to flee, but in her haste she knocks down the support. The cellar door falls on her head, killing her.\n\nAttempting to remove evidence of Mrs. Hallet's visit, Rynn goes outside to drive her car away but cannot start it. This attracts the attention of Mario, a teenager passing by. Mario is the nephew of Officer Miglioriti, a village policeman who previously had given Rynn a ride home from town.  Mario drives the car back to town, and Rynn rewards him with a dinner she prepares at her house.\n\nLater, Officer Miglioriti stops by and tells them Frank Hallet has reported his mother missing. The officer asks to see Rynn's father, but Mario covers for Rynn by saying her father has gone to bed. Later that night, Frank Hallet makes a surprise visit. Suspicious, and looking for answers about the whereabouts of his mother and Rynn's father, Frank tries to scare Rynn into talking, cruelly killing her pet hamster. Mario chases Frank away.\n\nRynn now trusts Mario and confesses her actual situation. Rynn's terminally ill father and abusive mother divorced long ago. To protect Rynn from being returned to her mother's custody after his death, her father moved them to America and made arrangements to allow Rynn to live alone, then committed suicide in the ocean when the tides would carry his body out to sea. Her father also left Rynn a jar of [[potassium cyanide]], telling her that it was a sedative to calm her mother if she ever came for her. Rynn coolly recounts how she put the powder in her mother's tea and watched her die.\n\nTrust between Rynn and Mario blossoms into romance.  On a cold, rainy day, they bury the bodies behind Rynn's house, but Mario catches cold. Suspicious of Rynn's continued evasions regarding her father's absence, Officer Miglioriti returns to the house one night and demands to see her father. Mario disguises himself as an old man and introduces himself to Miglioriti as Rynn's father.\n\nAs winter sets in, Mario is hospitalized after his cold causes [[pneumonia]]. Rynn visits an unconscious Mario in the hospital making her feel lonely. That night, as Rynn is going to bed, she is shocked to find Frank emerging from the cellar. Frank thinks he knows what happened to Rynn's parents and his mother and attempts to blackmail Rynn.  He offers to protect Rynn's secrets in exchange for her sexual favors. Rynn, seemingly defeated and resigned to Frank's demands, agrees to have tea together. Rynn puts some of the cyanide in her own cup and then takes the tea and almond cookies into the living room. Suspicious, Frank switches his cup with hers. Rynn watches intently as Frank succumbs to the poison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image|total_width=300\n| image1 = Paper Moon TV series Jodie Foster 1974.jpg\n| image2 = Martin Sheen 1987.jpg\n| footer = The cast includes [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Martin Sheen]]\n}}\n\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Rynn Jacobs, a girl who lives on her own.\n** Connie Foster, Jodie's 21-year-old sister, serves as Jodie's uncredited [[body double]] in a brief nude scene.\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Frank Hallet, grown son of Rynn's landlady.\n* [[Alexis Smith]] as Mrs. Cora Hallet, the mother of Frank Hallet and Rynn's landlady.\n* [[Mort Shuman]] as Officer Ron Miglioriti, a police officer who often visits Rynn.\n* [[Scott Jacoby (actor)|Scott Jacoby]] as Mario Podesta, the nephew of Officer Miglioriti, who befriends Rynn.\n\n==Themes==\nFelicia Feaster, writing for [[Turner Classic Movies]], found an \"unusual theme\" in the film, which she interpreted as being one of independence for children.<ref name=\"Feaster\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/150187%7C0/The-Little-Girl-Who-Lives-Down-the-Lane.html |title=The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane |last=Feaster |first=Felicia |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=5 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306135556/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/150187%7C0/The-Little-Girl-Who-Lives-Down-the-Lane.html |archive-date=6 March 2017 }}</ref> Professor James R.
