[[Steven Spielberg]] served as its uncredited executive producer, while [[Rick Baker]] provided the makeup and the creature designs for Harry. The film tells the story of a [[Seattle]] family's encounter with the [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoological]] creature [[Bigfoot]], partially inspired by the numerous claims of sightings in the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[California]], and other parts of both the United States and Canada over three centuries. In conjunction with the film's setting, shooting took place at several locations in the [[Cascade Range]] of Washington state near [[Interstate 90 in Washington|Interstate 90]] and the town of Index near [[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|US 2]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/leaving-seattle-for-a-weekend-adventure-via-highway-2-stop-for-elk-burgers-milkshakes-and-bigfoot-lore/|title=Leaving Seattle for a weekend adventure via Highway 2?

The DVD and all current showings of the film in the UK now refer to the film by its original title. The original title was and still is used in Spain.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a camping trip in the nearby [[Cascade mountains]], George Henderson drives home to suburban [[Seattle]] with his family when he hits a [[Bigfoot]] with his [[Ford Country Squire|station wagon]]. Believing it to be dead and the key to fame and fortune, the family straps the creature to the roof of their car. A lone hunter tracking the creature discovers the Hendersons' damaged license plate.\n\nThat night, George goes to the garage to examine the Bigfoot and discovers it was alive and has escaped. He finds the creature in the kitchen, having knocked over the refrigerator while looking for food. The family soon realizes that the creature is intelligent and friendly. The family bonds with the creature and George decides to return him to the wilderness. Naming the Bigfoot \"Harry\", George tries to lure him into the station wagon with food, but Harry becomes upset and runs off.\n\nSaddened, the family attempt to resume their normal lives, but sightings of Harry become more frequent as media fervor heightens. George tries to find Harry and visits the \"North American Museum of Anthropology\" to speak with Dr. Wallace Wrightwood, a supposed expert on Bigfoot. Giving his phone number to the museum clerk, George resumes his search. The legendary hunter-turned-Bigfoot-tracker, Jacques LaFleur, finds the Henderson household. At work, George's father asks him to make a poster of a vicious Bigfoot to drum up gun sales, but George throws the sketch away, replacing it with a proper depiction of the peaceful Harry. His father in turn alters it to make him look threatening, resulting in George quitting his job. George soon follows a Bigfoot sighting into the city while the terrified and confused Harry continues to evade hunters and the police as he attempts to find safety. George saves Harry from LaFleur, who is arrested. George brings Harry home and he is reunited with the Henderson family.\n\nGeorge invites Dr. Wrightwood to dinner, revealed to have been the museum clerk. He urges the Hendersons to give up on Bigfoot as it has destroyed his life. He then meets Harry, restoring his enthusiasm. Bailed out of jail, LaFleur travels to the Henderson house to kill Harry. Harry and the Hendersons escape with Dr. Wrightwood in his truck, and LaFleur gives chase. Fleeing back to the mountains, George tries to force Harry to leave. Confused and upset, Harry departs but the family realizes that LaFleur can track Harry's footprints in the snow. Despite their efforts to misdirect him, LaFleur tracks Harry and attempts to shoot him with a rifle. Harry subdues LaFleur and George intervenes when LaFleur attempts to escape, but Harry stops George from assaulting LaFleur. Through Harry's kindness, LaFleur gives up the hunt when he realizes that Harry is more than a simple beast.\n\nAs the family says goodbye, George thanks Harry and the two embrace. George tells him to take care of himself, to which Harry replies, \"Okay\" \u2013 revealing he has the ability to learn language. As Harry leaves, three other hiding Bigfoots and one adolescent suddenly emerge and then quickly disappear into the wilderness with Harry as the Henderson family watches in amazement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[John Lithgow]] as George Henderson\n* [[Melinda Dillon]] as Nancy Henderson\n* [[Margaret Langrick]] as Sarah Henderson\n* Joshua Rudoy as Ernie Henderson\n* [[Kevin Peter Hall]] as Harry (in-suit performer)\n** [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] as Harry (puppeteer)\n** Tom Hester as Harry (puppeteer)\n** Tim Lawrence as Harry (puppeteer)\n** [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] as Harry (voice)\n* Mitch Laue as the UNC Wilmington Legend (puppeteer)\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Irene Moffat\n* [[Don Ameche]] as Dr. Wallace Wrightwood\n* [[David Suchet]] as Jacques LaFleur\n* [[M.
