Paul is a short-tempered ex-convict recently released from prison for armed robbery, who is exploring his spiritual side hoping for atonement and a second chance. On his first day working in parks maintenance he is partnered with Murphy, a veteran groundskeeper, facing his advancing age and impending retirement. The day gets off to a rough start when Paul clashes with a condescending local business heir over a materials donation, loses his cool, announces he is quitting, and stalks off into the woods berating himself for always ruining everything.  Murphy follows him, defuses Paul's outburst and convinces him to stay.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the changing seasons the relationship between the men strengthens and develops more as father and son, poignant in contrast to Murphy's relationship with his dying homosexual son, whose impending death causes Murphy to doubt his past as a father and a man.  Working together through mundane days and personal crisis they share their lives, hopes, ambitions and regrets, as Paul learns to find stability and calm in his life and Murphy achieves acceptance and forgiveness for his mistakes.\n\nThe film ends with Paul presenting Murphy with a [[hamsa]] as a retirement gift and to signify the \"helping hand\" that Murphy has provided him through the past year.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as Murph\n*[[Liev Schreiber]] as Paul\n*[[Campbell Scott]] as Fredrickson\n*[[Ian Hart]] as Fran\n*[[Peri Gilpin]] as Georgia\n*[[Bill Raymond]] as Don Regan\n*[[Catherine Kellner]] as Dawn\n*[[Hallee Hirsh]] as Hope\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reviews for ''Spring Forward'' were mainly favorable, and it has achieved a rating of 86% on [[rottentomatoes.com]].<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spring_forward/ Spring Forward Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  It won third place mention for the Discovery Award honoring Best First Film at the 1999 Toronto film festival,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/movies/198533/Spring-Forward |title=Spring Forward Movie Details and Discussion at the Independent Film Channel - IFC.com |website=www.ifc.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180918/http://www.ifc.com/movies/198533/Spring-Forward |archive-date=2008-09-25}}</ref> won the Gold award for Independent Theatrical Feature Films (Drama) at the 2000 WorldFest in Houston and the Producer's Award at the 2001 Independent Spirit Awards.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156096/awards {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0156096}}\n* {{Amg movie|198533|Spring Forward}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
