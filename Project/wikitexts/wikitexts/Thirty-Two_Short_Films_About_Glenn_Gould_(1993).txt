It was directed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Girard]], with a screenplay by Girard and [[Don McKellar]].\n\nThe film is presented as a series of 31 [[short film]]s rather than as one narrative. Segments include documentaries, consisting of interviews with individuals who knew the real Gould, and reenactments of episodes in Gould's life. \"Gould Meets McLaren\" employs animated spheres from [[Norman McLaren]]'s filmography. The film received positive reviews and won four [[14th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nWith memories revolving around the family's cottage near [[Lake Simcoe]], Glenn Gould recalls how in his childhood, he had ostensibly made the decision to become a concert pianist at age five. In fact, he believes his mother had already chosen that career for him. He recalls being able to read music before he could read books, and learned the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] from his mother. Gould later imagines [[interview]]ing himself, in which he confronts himself about why he chose to quit giving concerts at the age of 32, preferring to communicate to his audience through media instead. Gould reminds himself that the musician is inescapably an autocrat, no matter how benign.\n\nIn crafting [[radio documentary|radio documentaries]], Gould works on a piece called ''The Idea of North'', which touches on the effects the environment has on the solitude and isolation of the people of [[Northern Canada]]. In a media interview, Gould reveals that ''The Idea of North'' is one of only five of his documentaries about isolation, and that he intends to make a comedy next because he is tired of serious expression. Interviewers also push him to explain how he could achieve his level of musical perfection without interest in being overly technical in his piano playing. They ask why he insists on being interviewed only over the telephone. Others question if Gould's supposed obsession in technology is merely a smokescreen to keep his distance from real people.\n\nAs the markets plummet, Gould picks up word from the bodyguard of the visiting [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani|Sheik Yamani]] to invest in an obscure company called Sotex Resources, which is set to benefit from an exploration contract. Gould becomes the only client to profit in the wake of financial meltdown. However, Margaret Pacsu, a friend, notices Gould's bathroom is stocked heavily with various pills, including [[Valium]], [[Trifluoperazine]] and [[Librax]]. Gould laughs off the idea that he is taking all of the pills simultaneously, and Pacsu does not notice any effects on his personality. As his birthday approaches, Gould becomes concerned that no one will attend his funeral, despite being aware of strong record sales in [[Central Europe]] and Japan. Gould dies at age 50 of a stroke. His cousin, Jessie Greig, says Gould was wrong and his funeral was heavily attended. He had noted [[Voyager I]] and [[Voyager II]], space probes launched for possible contact with [[extraterrestrial intelligence]], contains Bach's music as played by Gould.\n\n===Segments===\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n# Aria\n# [[Lake Simcoe]]\n# Forty-Five Seconds and a Chair \n# [[Bruno Monsaingeon]]: musician and collaborator\n# Gould Meets Gould: text by Glenn Gould\n# Hamburg\n# Variation in c minor\n# Practice\n# The L.A.

Producer [[Niv Fichman]] explained, \"He was our greatest hero.

McKellar was initially opposed to the idea of adapting Gould's life into a film, calling it \"an undramatic life\".<ref name=\"Schawrtzberg\"/> However, Girard's concept of 32 \"short films\" intrigued him.
