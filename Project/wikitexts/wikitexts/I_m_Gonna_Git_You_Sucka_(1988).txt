The inspiration behind the film came from Wayans, who is a fan of blaxploitation films, and his childhood spent growing up watching these films as they made up the majority of black films made during the 1960s and 1970s. Sitting with friends and making fun of the genre struck the idea for the film in Wayans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|title=Spoofing Blaxploitation \u2013 The actor/writer/director of 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka' decided the genre was ripe for parody.|last=Kelleher|first=Terry|date=Jan 12, 1989|work=Newsday}}</ref> Before making ''I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka'', Wayans spent five years earning credentials for films such as ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[Eddie Murphy Raw]]''.

It grossed a total of $3 million in the box office in the first month of the film's release.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'' has a rating of 62% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 29 reviews, the critical consensus on the website saying that the film \"puts a satirical spin on '70s nostalgia with a comedy whose somewhat scattershot laughs are often offset by pure energetic silliness.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/im_gonna_git_you_sucka |title=I'm Gonna Git You Sucka |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2021-08-17}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened with rave responses from the black community. African-American audience members were thrilled to attend the screening of a movie filled with black actors about a black film genre.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title=Folks turn out for 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka' opening|last=Jones|first=Debra|date=Jan 28, 1989|work=New York Amsterdam News (1962-1993)}}</ref> ''I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka'' received critical receptions that were wide-ranging and numerous in viewpoint. To the urban public, the parody film perfectly captured the era of blaxploitation films in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Screenings: I'm Gonna Git You Sucka|last=Fitch|first=Janet|date=Dec 1, 1988|work=American Film}}</ref> Critics also noted Wayans\u2019 ability to satirically capture the era of the \u201cBuck\u201d in blaxploitation film: the white man's notion of the all-powerful brutal black man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies, and Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Films|last=Bogle|first=Donald|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2001|isbn=9780826412676|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tomscoonsmulatto0004bogl/page/231 231\u2013266]|url=https://archive.org/details/tomscoonsmulatto0004bogl/page/231}}</ref>\n\nIn her analysis of the film, Harriet Margolis writes that this is not because \u201c[Jack] consciously chooses to reject his mother\u2019s values as that he wants to establish his own based on the macho heroic values he learned during the heyday of blaxploitation films.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Margolis|first=Harriet|date=1999|title=Stereotypical Strategies: Black Film Aesthetics, Spectator Positioning, and Self-Directed Stereotypes in Hollywood Shuffle and I'm Gonna Git You Sucka|journal=Cinema Journal}}</ref>\n\nRobert Sklar wrote \u201cThe [blaxploitation film] movement quickly developed into a phenomenon not of an African-American audience but of a specific subgroup, a segment of a segment: young urban males,\u201d so often the perspective and narratives of young black women were left out or included as the background in many of these films during the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies|last=Sklar|first=Robert|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nCritics of the film argued that the film not only failed at producing humor in its use of black stereotypes, but generally was not funny. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote ''I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka'' is \"a comedy that feeds off the blaxploitation movie, and although, like all good satires, it is cheerfully willing to be offensive, it is almost completely incapable of being funny.\" There was also a concern about the perception of the film by the white movie going audience. The film's villain, Mr. Big, is not only a white man, but a white man responsible for the deterioration of an inner city black community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Television pilot==\nOn December 15, 1990, the hour-long television pilot titled ''Hammer, Slammer, & Slade'' was shown on ABC-TV.<ref>{{cite news|title= Night of the Living Laughs |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1990-04-13|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317171,00.html|access-date=2011-01-30|first=Mark|last=Schwed}}</ref> It was directed by [[Michael Schultz]].\n\n[[Isaac Hayes]] (Hammer), [[Jim Brown]] (Slammer), and [[Bernie Casey]] (Slade) continued in their parts from the movie ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka''.
