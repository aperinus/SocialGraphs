The picture was made by [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). It was directed by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], who also wrote the screenplay. The film is based on the [[Guys and Dolls|1950 Broadway musical]] by composer and lyricist [[Frank Loesser]], with a book by [[Jo Swerling]] and [[Abe Burrows]], which, in turn, was loosely based on \"[[The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown]]\" (1933) and \"Blood Pressure\", two short stories by [[Damon Runyon]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ebooks-library.com/author.cfm/AuthorID/900 |title = Damon Runyon|work = Authors|publisher = The eBooks-Library|access-date = 2008-07-20}}</ref> Dances were choreographed by [[Michael Kidd]], who had staged the dances for the Broadway production.\n\nAt Samuel Goldwyn and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's request, Frank Loesser wrote three new songs for the film: \"Pet Me Poppa\", \"[[A Woman in Love|(Your Eyes Are the Eyes of) A Woman in Love]]\", and \"Adelaide\", the last written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs in the stage musical were omitted from the movie: \"[[A Bushel and a Peck]]\", \"My Time of Day\", \"[[I've Never Been in Love Before]]\" (although portions of these three songs are heard instrumentally as background music), \"[[More I Cannot Wish You]]\" and \"Marry the Man Today\".\n\n== Plot ==\nGambler Nathan Detroit seeks to organize an unlicensed [[craps|craps game]], but the police, led by Lieutenant Brannigan, are \"putting on the heat.\"  Nathan's usual locations are turning him away due to Brannigan's intimidating pressure. The Biltmore garage will allow Nathan to hold a game, but the owner requires a $1,000 security deposit, which Nathan does not have. Adding to his problems, Nathan's fianc\u00e9e, Miss Adelaide, a nightclub singer, wants to get married after being engaged for 14 years. She also wants him to go straight, but he only is good at organizing illegal gambling.\n\nNathan spots an old acquaintance, Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything and for high amounts. To win the $1,000 security deposit, Nathan bets Sky that he cannot take a girl of Nathan's choosing to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Nathan then nominates Sergeant Sarah Brown, a sister at the Save a Soul [[Mission (station)|Mission]], which opposes gambling.\n\nSky pretends to be a repentant gambler as a means to meet Sarah. Sky proposes a bargain: He will recruit a dozen sinners into the Mission for her Thursday-night meeting if she will have dinner with him in Havana. With General Matilda Cartwright threatening to close the Mission's Broadway branch due to low attendance, Sarah agrees to the date.\n\nMeanwhile, confident that he will win the bet, Nathan gathers all the gamblers, including a visitor that Harry the Horse has invited: Big Jule, a mobster. When Lieutenant Brannigan appears, Benny Southstreet claims they are celebrating Nathan marrying Adelaide. Nathan is shocked, but is forced to play along. Later, he realizes he has lost his bet and must marry Adelaide.\n\nOver the course of their short stay in Cuba, Sky breaks down Sarah's social inhibitions with Bacardi-spiked \"milkshakes.\" They begin to fall in love. They return to Broadway at dawn and meet the Save a Soul Mission band, which has been parading all night on Sky's advice. Police sirens are heard, and the gamblers, led by Nathan Detroit, flee out through the back room of the empty Mission where they were holding a crap game.\n\nThe police arrive too late to make any arrests, but Lieutenant Brannigan finds Sarah and the other Save a Soul members being absent unlikely to be a coincidence and suspects Sky. Sarah is equally suspicious that Sky has had something to do with organizing the crap game at the Mission, and she angrily takes her leave of him, refusing to accept his denials.\n\nSky still has to make good his arrangement with Sarah to provide sinners to the Mission. Sarah would rather forget the whole thing, but Uncle Arvide Abernathy, who acts as a kind of father figure to her, warns Sky that \"If you don't make that marker good, I'm going to buzz it all over town you're a welcher.\"\n\nNathan has continued the crap game in a sewer. With his revolver visible in its shoulder holster, Big Jule, who has lost all his money, forces Nathan to play against him while he cheats, cleaning Nathan out. Sky enters and knocks Big Jule down, and removes his pistol. Sky, who has been stung and devastated by Sarah's rejection, lies to Nathan that he lost the bet about taking her to Havana and pays Nathan the $1,000. Nathan tells Big Jule he now has money to play him again, but Harry the Horse says that Big Jule cannot play without cheating because \"he cannot make a pass to save his soul.\" Sky overhears this, and the phrasing inspires him to make a bold bet: He will roll the dice, and if he loses, he will give all the other gamblers $1,000 each; if he wins, they are all to attend a prayer meeting at the Mission.\n\nThe Mission is near closing when suddenly the gamblers arrive, filling the room; Sky won the roll. They grudgingly confess their sins, though with little repentance. Nicely-Nicely Johnson however, recalling a dream he had the night before, seems to have an authentic connection to the Mission's aim, and this satisfies everyone.\n\nWhen Nathan tells Sarah that Sky lost the Cuba bet, which she knows he won, she hurries off to make up with him. It all ends with a double wedding in the middle of [[Times Square]], with Sky marrying Sarah, and Nathan marrying Adelaide.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Sky Masterson\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Sister Sarah Brown\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Nathan Detroit\n* [[Vivian Blaine]] as Miss Adelaide\n* [[Stubby Kaye]] as Nicely-Nicely Johnson\n* [[B.S.

For the movie, [[Gene Kelly]] at first, seemed a serious candidate for the part. Still, it went to Marlon Brando, partly because Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer would not loan Kelly for the production, and because Goldwyn wanted to cast Brando, the world's biggest box office draw by a wide margin at that time. Ironically, the film ended up being distributed by MGM, Kelly's home studio. Frank Sinatra had coveted the role of Sky Masterson, and his relations with Brando were strained. Hollywood critic James Bacon quotes Sinatra telling director Joe Mankiewicz, \"When Mumbles is through rehearsing, I'll come out.\"<ref>''Pictures Will Talk'', Kenneth L. Geist, p. 258</ref> Sinatra had been considered for the role of Terry Malloy in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'';<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/trivia On the Waterfront (1954) \u2013 Trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> both roles went to Brando.\n\nBecause [[Betty Grable]] was not available to play Miss Adelaide, Goldwyn cast [[Vivian Blaine]], who had originated the role on stage.<ref>''Goldwyn'', A.

When she turned the part down because of other commitments, Goldwyn contacted [[Deborah Kerr]], who was unavailable. The third choice was Jean Simmons, who had played opposite Brando in ''[[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (film)|D\u00e9sir\u00e9e]]''. Goldwyn was surprised by Simmons's sweet voice and strong acting and ultimately believed the love story worked better in the film than on stage. \"I'm so happy,\" he said after seeing the rushes one day, \"that I couldn't get Grace Kelly.\" Director Joe Mankiewicz later called Simmons \"the dream...a fantastically talented and enormously underestimated girl. In terms of talent, Jean Simmons is so many heads and shoulders above most of her contemporaries, one wonders why she didn't become the great star she could have been.\"<ref>''Pictures Will Talk'', Geist, p. 258</ref>\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nFive songs from the stage show were not included in the movie: \"[[A Bushel and a Peck]],\" \"[[I've Never Been in Love Before]],\" \"My Time of Day,\" \"Marry the Man Today,\" and \"[[More I Cannot Wish You]]\".
