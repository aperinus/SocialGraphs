Animation divided into three independent parts (''Picture'', ''Game'' and ''But maybe, but maybe...''). The film was Russia's first [[claymation]] film.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Antonova |first=Maria |date=September\u2013October 2007 |title=An Animating Genius: Alexander Tatarsky, 1950-2007 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-169026078/an-animating-genius-alexander-tatarsky-1950-2007 |magazine=[[Russian Life]] |location=[[ Montpelier, Vermont]], [[United States of America|USA]] |publisher=Russian Information Services |volume=50 |issue=5 |access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot synopsis==\n===Picture===\nThe first part tells kids about the three [[Painting#Common painting idioms|painting style]]s \u2013 [[Landscape painting|landscape]], [[still life]] and [[portrait]].\n\nLyrics for the first part were written by [[Alexander Kushner]] and sung by Grigory Gladkov, who also composed whole cartoon.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://a-pesni.org/baby/okartinah.php Song about the paintings]</ref>\n\n===Game===\nThe second part features the story of grandpa and his nephew playing the children game where the players periodically opens and shuts their eyes. And every time they are amazed with looking to something new in front of them.\n\nThis part was based on lyrics by [[Ovsey Driz]] and performed by [[Leonid Bronevoy]] and Alesha Pavlov.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://a-pesni.org/baby/votjavizu.php Here I see...]</ref>\n\n===But maybe, but maybe...===\nThe final part is a parody of ''[[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The Crow and the Fox]]'', best known in Russian with the version by [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]]. The storytellers (Lev Shimelov and Alexander Levenbuk) can't remember the story plot, and they are trying to recall it.\n\nThus, instead of the crow from Krylov's story, a dog appears, and then a cow, and even a hippopotamus. The original fox is also replaced by an ostrich and then by a [[janitor|street cleaner]].\n\nAt the end of the entirely distorted fable, a distorted moral is given: ''Don't stand and don't jump, don't sing and don't dance where there is construction in progress or heavy load hanging.'' (This is a pun on the two common Russian danger signs \u2013 \"Don't stand under heavy load\" and \"Beware! Construction works in progress!\").\n\nThe lyrics for the third part were written by [[Eduard Uspensky]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://a-pesni.org/baby/amozvorona.php But maybe Crow\u2026]</ref>\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Leonid Bronevoy]]\n* [[Grigory Gladkov]]\n* [[Lev Shimelov]]\n* [[Alexander Levenbuk]]\n* Alesha Pavlov\n\n==Censorship==\nAt the time of release, the Soviet state officials wanted to ban the film because of (what they described) \"ideological nonsense\". Nevertheless, head of Kinopanorama television programme [[Xeniya Marinina]] and host and film director [[Eldar Ryazanov]] managed to show cartoon in one of editions of Kinopanorama on [[Soviet Central Television]], bypassing the censorship.\n\n==Production==\n* Creation of the film required about 800&nbsp;kg of soviet plasticine. Because of withered colors the plasticine was dye-colored.\n* The music in the third part of the film was intended to sound in the ordinary tempo, but its total length appeared to be longer than the animation created (8 minutes instead of 5). While Tatarskiy was in doubt, the voices arrived. Then the genius decision came when Tatarsky remembered how the gramophone-recorded voice of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was restored by varying speed of phonation. He griped the recording to the necessary length (5 min), and the song acquired its recognisable sounding.\n* The music in the third part is borrowing heavily from the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[folk song]] ''[[Whiskey in the Jar]]''. The beginning of the second verse of the song (\"\u041d\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0430...\") in this part is based on [[George Harrison]]'s song ''[[My Sweet Lord]]''.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0219251}}\n* [http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&fid=4932 ''Plasticine Crow''] at [[Animator.ru]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IU34Yt-kEg The Plasticine Crow / \u041f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 - Russian cartoon with English subtitles]\n* [[Talk:Plasticine Crow/Translation|Translation into English of the song from the third part]]\n* ''\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0451\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \n* ''\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438-\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0449\u0438\u043a\u0438: \u2014'' \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0451\u0432 \n* ''\u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u042d\u0440\u043d\u0441\u0442 \u0413\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d \n* ''\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0432 \n* ''\u0417\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u041d\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0443\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \n* ''\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438: \u2014'' \u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u00ab\u0410 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u2026\u00bb\n* ''\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0451\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430 \n* ''\u0420\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 \n* ''\u0414\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b: \u2014'' \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430  \n\n[[Category:1981 animated films]]\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1981 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Soviet animated films]]\n[[Category:Clay animation films]]\n[[Category:Studio Ekran films]]\n[[Category:1980s stop-motion animated films]]"}]}}}}
