It is the sequel to the 2000 film ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]''.\n\n''Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous'' was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on March 24, 2005 and grossed over $101 million worldwide, and received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral weeks after the events of [[Miss Congeniality (film)|the first film]], in which FBI agent Gracie Hart infiltrated the [[Miss United States]] [[beauty pageant]], her new-found fame results in her cover being blown while she is trying to prevent a bank heist.\n\nTo capitalize on Gracie's publicity the FBI decide to make her the new \"face\" of the bureau. After being dumped by her boyfriend, fellow agent Eric Matthews (who gets relocated to Miami), Gracie agrees to the reassignment.\n\nWhen FBI agent Sam Fuller gets relocated to New York City from Chicago, Gracie doesn't take to her at all. The feeling seems to be mutual as the FBI eventually makes Sam Gracie's bodyguard, much to Sam's disgust.\n\nTen months later, Gracie begins appearing on morning television shows, such as ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and [[The Food Channel]], giving out fashion advice and promoting her book.\n\nHowever, when Gracie's friends, Cheryl Fraser (the current Miss United States) and Stan Fields, are kidnapped in Las Vegas, she goes undercover to try to rescue them, accompanied by Sam who is following up on her own lead after video footage of the abduction suggests that Fields was the target rather than Cheryl. This puts Gracie at odds with the FBI, who are unwilling to lose their mascot and are unsure if she's still up to the task.\n\nThe kidnappers move Cheryl and Stan to the ship at the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino]] which they plan to sink. Soon afterwards, Gracie, Sam and Joel (Gracie's new stylist) arrive at the Oasis Drag club where they end up singing [[Tina Turner]] songs and are given Cheryl and Stan's location by a contestant dressed as Dolly Parton. It is then up to Gracie to save the day once more, this time with the help of agent Sam.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Gracie Hart\n* [[Regina King]] as Sam Fuller\n* [[Enrique Murciano]] as Jeff Foreman\n* [[William Shatner]] as Stan Fields\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Harry McDonald\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Cheryl Frasier (Miss United States)\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Joel\n* [[Vic Chao]] as Agent Hills\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Walter Collins\n* [[John DiResta]] as Agent Clonsky\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Lou Steele\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Karl Steele\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Carol Fields\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Tom Abernathy\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Janet\n* [[Leslie Grossman]] as Pam\n* [[Lusia Strus]] as Janine\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Bartender\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as Shirley\n* Molly Gottlieb as Priscilla\n* [[Dolly Parton]] as Herself\n* Christopher Ford as Jason\n* [[Regis Philbin]] as Himself\n* [[Joy Philbin]] as Herself\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Octavia\n*  Ross Adam as Brian Cosford\n\n==Production==\nSandra Bullock and writer [[Marc Lawrence (filmmaker)|Marc Lawrence]] initially had no plans for a sequel. While working on ''[[Two Weeks Notice]]'', Bullock and Lawrence joked about ideas for a ''Miss Congeniality'' sequel, some of which \"weren't that far-fetched\" according to Bullock. Las Vegas was featured in an early version of the first film, but was ultimately written out of the script. A five-week shoot in southern Nevada began on April 12, 2004.<ref name=apr12>{{cite web |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-12-Mon-2004/living/23628057.html|title= Shooting Stars: Production on Bullock's 'Miss Congeniality 2' set to start|last= Cling|first= Carol|date= April 12, 2004|website= Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050312095309/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-12-Mon-2004/living/23628057.html|archive-date= March 12, 2005}}</ref> Approximately half of the film's scenes were scheduled to be shot in Las Vegas.<ref name=apr19/>\n\nMajor filming locations included the Treasure Island and [[The Venetian Las Vegas|Venetian]] resorts.<ref name=apr12/><ref name=apr19>{{cite web |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-19-Mon-2004/living/23670866.html|title= Shooting Stars: 'Congeniality' continues work; 'Crossfire,' 'Tonight Show' on way|last= Cling|first= Carol|date= April 19, 2004|work= Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041030055058/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-19-Mon-2004/living/23670866.html|archive-date= October 30, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-26-Mon-2004/living/23730478.html|title= Shooting Stars: NBC drama 'Las Vegas' prepares to film exterior scenes|last= Cling|first= Carol|date= April 26, 2004|work= Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041114185631/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Apr-26-Mon-2004/living/23730478.html|archive-date= November 14, 2004}}</ref> Scenes shot at Treasure Island included its [[Sirens of TI]] pirate show, which had never been featured in a film before and was closed to the public for filming.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/May-03-Mon-2004/living/23779292.html|title= Shooting Stars: 'Miss Congeniality 2' prepares to film at Treasure Island|last= Cling|first= Carol|date= May 3, 2004|work= Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041222024650/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/May-03-Mon-2004/living/23779292.html|archive-date= December 22, 2004}}</ref> Other filming locations included the [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign]] and the [[Klondike Hotel and Casino]].<ref name=apr19/> In May 2004, filming took place at the [[Lloyd D.
