The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert: \"{{lang|fr|La haine attire la haine!}}\", \"hatred breeds hatred\". Kassovitz was awarded the Best Director prize at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\n''La Haine'' opens with a montage of news footage of urban [[riots]] in a ''[[banlieue]]'' in the commune of [[Chanteloup-les-Vignes]] near Paris. A local man, Abdel Ichaha, is in intensive care having been gravely injured in police custody. In the ensuing riots the local police station is besieged, and a police officer loses his revolver. The film depicts approximately twenty consecutive hours in the lives of three friends of Abdel, all young men from [[immigrant]] families, in the aftermath of the riot.\n\nVinz is a young [[Jewish people|Jewish]] man with an aggressive temperament who wishes to avenge Abdel, has a blanket condemnation of all police officers, and secretly reenacts [[Travis Bickle]] from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the bathroom mirror. Hubert is an [[Black people in France|Afro-French]] boxer and small-time [[drug dealer]] who yearns to leave the ''banlieue'' for a better life and refuses to provoke the police, but whose boxing gymnasium was burned down in the riots. Sa\u00efd is a young [[North Africa]]n [[Muslims|Muslim]] who plays a mediating role between Vinz and Hubert.\n\nThe three go through an aimless daily routine, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After the police break a rooftop gathering and the three sit idly on a playground, Vinz reveals to the other two that he has found the [[.44 Magnum]] revolver lost in the riot, and plans to use it to kill a police officer if Abdel dies. Although Hubert disapproves, Vinz secretly takes the gun with him. The three go to see Abdel in the hospital, but are turned away by the police. Sa\u00efd is arrested after their aggressive refusal to leave. He is later released with the help of a familiar police officer.\n\nFollowing a disagreement between Vinz and Hubert about their perspectives on policing and violence, the two men part ways. Sa\u00efd accompanies Vinz, while Hubert briefly returns to his home. They reunite at another gathering in the banlieue, but the situation quickly turns chaotic when Abdel's brother attempts to kill a police officer in revenge. A confrontation with the police ensues, and the group narrowly escapes after Vinz nearly shoots a riot officer. They take a train to Paris, where their responses to both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to escalate to dangerous hostility. In a public restroom, a [[Gulag]] survivor tells them of a friend who refused to relieve himself in public and subsequently [[Hypothermia|froze to death]], puzzling the three as to the meaning of the story.\n\nThey then go to see Snoopy, an avid cocaine user who owes Sa\u00efd money, leading to a violent confrontation as he appears to try to force Vinz to play [[Russian roulette]] (the gun is secretly unloaded). They have a run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] police, who arrest Sa\u00efd and Hubert while Vinz flees. The police verbally and physically abuse the duo and lock them up until late night, which results in the three missing the last train from [[Gare Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare station]] and spending the night on the streets.\n\nAfter being kicked out of an [[art gallery]] and unsuccessfully trying to [[Hot-wiring|hotwire]] a car, the trio stay in a shopping mall and learn from a news broadcast that Abdel is dead. They travel to a rooftop from which they insult [[skinhead]]s and policemen, before encountering the same group of skinheads who begin to beat Sa\u00efd and Hubert savagely. Vinz breaks up the fight at gunpoint and captures one of the skinheads. His plan to execute him is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his heartless gangster pose does not reflect his true nature. Vinz lets the skinhead flee.\n\nEarly in the morning, the trio return home and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. Vinz and Sa\u00efd encounter a plainclothes officer whom Vinz had insulted earlier whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. The officer grabs and threatens Vinz, taunting him with a loaded gun held to his head. Hubert rushes to their aid, but the officer's gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz. As Hubert and the officer point their guns at each other and Sa\u00efd closes his eyes, a single gunshot is heard, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit.\n\nThis stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines (\"It's about a society in free fall...\"), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' (\"so far so good\"); all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Vinz\n* [[Hubert Kound\u00e9]] as Hubert\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Sa\u00efd\n* [[Marc Duret]] as Inspector Notre Dame\n* [[Abdel Ahmed Ghili]] as Abdel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Levantal]] as Ast\u00e9rix (named Snoopy in some English editions)\n* [[Beno\u00eet Magimel]] as Beno\u00eet\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]] as the concierge\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as police chief\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as plainclothes police officer\n* [[Vincent Lindon]] as drunk guy\n* [[Karin Viard]] as gallery girl\n* [[Peter Kassovitz]] as gallery patron\n* [[Anthony Souter]] as skinhead\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as captured skinhead\n}}\n\n==Production==\nKassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young [[Zaire|Zairian]], [[:fr:Affaire Makom\u00e9 M'Bowol\u00e9|Makom\u00e9 M'Bowol\u00e9]], was shot in 1993.
