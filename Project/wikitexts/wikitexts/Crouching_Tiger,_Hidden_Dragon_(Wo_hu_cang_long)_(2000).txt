Shu Lien and Mu Bai have long had feelings for each other, but because Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's close friend, Meng Sizhao<ref name=\"YenMovieRol\">{{cite web|url=http://moviehole.net/201362831yen-confirms-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-rumours|title=Yen confirms Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon rumours|author=Caffeinated Clint|publisher=Moviehole|date=18 March 2013|access-date=2013-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214112904/http://moviehole.net/201362831yen-confirms-crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-rumours|archive-date=14 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> before his death, Shu Lien and Mu Bai feel bound by loyalty to Meng Sizhao and have not revealed their feelings for each other. Mu Bai, choosing to retire, asks Shu Lien to give his fabled 400-year-old sword \"Green Destiny\" to their benefactor Sir Te in [[Beijing]]. Long ago, Mu Bai's teacher was killed by Jade Fox, a woman who sought to learn Wudang skills. While at Sir Te's place, Shu Lien meets Yu Jiaolong, or Jen, who is the daughter of the rich and powerful Governor Yu and is about to get married.\n\nOne evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Sir Te's servant Master Bo and Shu Lien trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound, where Jade Fox had been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Soon after, Mu Bai arrives in Beijing and discusses the theft with Shu Lien. Master Bo makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai, a police investigator from the provinces, and his daughter May, who have come to Beijing in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Master Bo to a showdown that night.  Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. She reveals that she killed Mu Bai's teacher because he would sleep with her, but refuse to take a woman as a pupil, and she felt it poetic justice for him to die at a woman's hand. Just as Mu Bai is about to kill her, the masked thief reappears and helps Fox. Fox kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual. Fox is illiterate and could only follow the diagrams, whereas Jen's ability to read the manual allowed her to surpass her  teacher in martial arts.\n\nAt night, a bandit named Lo breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. A [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals that in the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts, Lo and his bandits raided Jen's caravan and Lo stole her comb. She pursued him to his desert cave to get her comb back. However, the pair soon fell in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a cliff to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, he did not die. Lo has come now to Beijing to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage. However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to leave with him. Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at [[Wudang Mountains|Mount Wudang]], where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. Disguised in male clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the Green Destiny and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious.\n\nJen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry exchange, the two women engage in a duel. Shu Lien is the superior fighter, but Jen wields the Green Destiny and is able to destroy each weapon that Shu Lien wields, until Shu Lien finally manages to defeat Jen with a broken sword. When Shu Lien shows mercy, Jen wounds Shu Lien in the arm. Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest. Mu Bai confronts Jen and offers to take her as his student. She promises to accept him as her teacher if he can take Green Destiny from her in three moves. Mu Bai is able to take the sword in one move, but Jen reneges and Mu Bai throws the sword over a waterfall. Jen dives after it and is then rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern, where Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her. Fox suddenly appears and attacks the others with poisoned needles. Mu Bai blocks the needles with his sword and mortally wounds Fox, only to realize that one of the needles has hit him in the neck. With her last breath, Fox confesses that her goal had been to kill Jen because Jen had hidden the secrets of Wudang's fighting techniques from her.\n\nContrite, Jen leaves to prepare an antidote for the poisoned dart. With his last breath, Mu Bai finally confesses his love for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns. Shu Lien forgives Jen, telling her to go to Lo and always be true to herself. The Green Destiny is returned to Sir Te. Jen later goes to Mount Wudang and spends the  night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. Lo wishes for them to be together again, back in the desert. Jen then glides off the bridge and gently floats down into the mists.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Chow Yun Fat for wiki.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Actor Chow Yun-Fat who portrayed Li Mu Bai]]\nCredits from [[British Film Institute]]:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wo Hu Zang Long (2000)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8301abe5|access-date=2021-04-04|website=BFI|language=en|archive-date=14 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414201427/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8301abe5|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Li Mu Bai (C: \u674e\u6155\u767d, P: ''L\u01d0 M\u00f9b\u00e1i'')\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Yu Shu Lien (T: \u4fde\u79c0\u84ee, S: \u4fde\u79c0\u83b2, P: ''Y\u00fa Xi\u00f9li\u00e1n'')\n* [[Zhang Ziyi]] as Jen Yu (T: \u7389\u5b0c\u9f8d, S: \u7389\u5a07\u9f99, P: ''Y\u00f9 Ji\u0101ol\u00f3ng'')\n* [[Chang Chen]] as Lo \"Dark Cloud\" Xiao Hou (T: \u7f85\u5c0f\u864e, S: \u7f57\u5c0f\u864e, P: ''Lu\u00f3 Xi\u01ceoh\u01d4'')\n* [[Sihung Lung|Lang Sihung]] as Sir Te (T: \u8c9d\u52d2\u723a, S: \u8d1d\u52d2\u7237, P: ''B\u00e8i-l\u00e8y\u00e9'')\n* [[Cheng Pei-pei]] as Jade Fox (C: \u78a7\u773c\u72d0\u72f8, P: ''B\u00ecy\u01cen H\u00fali'')\n* Li Fazeng as Governor Yu (S: \u7389\u5927\u4eba, P: ''Y\u00f9 D\u00e0r\u00e9n'')\n* Wang Deming as Inspector Tsai (S: \u8521\u4e5d, P: ''C\u00e0i Ji\u01d4'')\n* Li Li as Tsai May (S: \u8521\u9999\u59b9, P: ''C\u00e0i Xi\u0101ng M\u00e8i'')\n* Hai Yan as Madam Yu (S: \u7389\u592b\u4eba, P: ''Y\u00f9 F\u016bren'')\n* Gao Xi'an as Bo (S: \u5289\u6cf0\u4fdd, P: ''Li\u00fa T\u00e0ib\u01ceo'')\n* Huang Suying as Aunt Wu (S: \u5433\u5abd, P: ''W\u00fa M\u0101'')\n* Zhang JinTing as De Lu (S: \u5fb7\u797f, P: D\u00e9 L\u00f9)\n* Du ZhenXi as Uncle Jiao (S: \u7126\u5927\u723a, P: Ji\u0101o D\u00e0-Y\u00e9)\n* Li Kai as Gou Jun Pei (S: \u9b6f\u541b\u4f69, P: ''L\u01d4 J\u016bn P\u00e8i'')\n* Feng Jianhua as Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou (S: \u9b6f\u541b\u96c4, P: L\u01d4 J\u016bn Xi\u00f3ng)\n* Ma Zhongxuan as Iron Arm Mi (S: \u7c73\u5927\u93e2, ''M\u01d0-D\u00e0 Bi\u0101o'')\n* Li Bao-Cheng as Flying Machete Chang (S: \u98db\u5200\u5e38, P: ''F\u0113i D\u0101o Ch\u00e1ng'')\n* Yang Yongde as Monk Jing (S: \u6cd5\u5ee3\u548c\u5c1a, P: ''F\u01ce Gu\u01ceng H\u00e9shang'')\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n===Title===\nThe title \"''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon''\" is a literal translation of the [[Chengyu|Chinese idiom]] \"\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d\" which describes a place or situation that is full of unnoticed masters. It is from a poem of the ancient Chinese poet [[Yu Xin]] (513\u2013581) that reads \"\u6697\u77f3\u7591\u85cf\u864e\uff0c\u76e4\u6839\u4f3c\u81e5\u9f8d\", which means \"behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon\".<ref name=\"title\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/c/7/172/385491.htm|title=Chinese Dictionary \u2013 Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon|access-date=27 June 2013|archive-date=3 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011537/http://www.zdic.net/c/7/172/385491.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The title also has several other layers of meaning. On the most obvious level, the Chinese characters in the title connect to the narrative that the last character in Xiaohu and Jiaolong's names mean \"tiger\" and \"dragon\", respectively. On another level, the Chinese idiomatic phrase is an expression referring to the undercurrents of emotion, passion, and secret desire that lie beneath the surface of polite society and civil behavior,<ref name=\"dilley\" /> which alludes to the film's storyline.\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nThe success of the Disney animated feature ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998) popularized the image of the Chinese woman warrior in the west.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cai |first=Rong |date=2005-09-12 |title=Gender Imaginations in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Wuxia World |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186805 |journal=Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=441\u2013471 |doi=10.1215/10679847-13-2-441 |s2cid=145605168 |issn=1527-8271 |access-date=15 June 2020 |archive-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812114304/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186805 |url-status=live }}</ref> The storyline of ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' is mostly driven by the three female characters.<ref name=zh>{{cite journal |journal=\u5ee3\u64ad\u8207\u96fb\u8996 |year=2005 |volume=24 |pages=93\u2013120 |title=\u81e5\u864e\u85cf\u9f8d\u300c\u85cf\u300d\u4e86\u4ec0\u9ebc?\u5f9e\u5973\u6027\u4e3b\u7fa9\u96fb\u5f71\u7406\u8ad6\u300c\u7537\u6027\u51dd\u8996\u300d\u89c0\u9ede\u8ac7\u6b66\u4fe0\u96fb\u5f71\u65b0\u985e\u578b |author=\u66fe\u6b66\u6e05 |language=zh }}</ref> In particular, Jen is driven by her desire to be free from the gender role imposed on her,<ref>{{cite journal |title= I Am the Invincible Sword Goddess: Mediatization of Chinese Gender Ideology through Female Kung-Fu Practitioners in Films|author1=Mie Hiramoto |author2= Cherise Shi Ling Teo|journal=Societies|year= 2014|volume= 4|issue=3|pages= 477\u2013505|doi=10.3390/soc4030477|doi-access=free }}</ref> while Shu Lien, herself oppressed by the gender role, tries to lead Jen back into the role deemed appropriate for her.<ref name=zh/> Some prominent martial arts disciplines are traditionally held to have been originated by women, e.g., [[Wing Chun]]. The film's title refers to masters one does not notice, which necessarily includes mostly women, and therefore suggests the advantage of a female bodyguard.\n\n===Poison===\n[[Poison]] is also a significant theme in the film. The Chinese word \"\u6bd2\" (''d\u00fa'') means not only physical poison but also cruelty and sinfulness. In the world of martial arts, the use of poison is considered an act of one who is too cowardly and dishonorable to fight; and indeed, the only character who explicitly fits these characteristics is Jade Fox. The poison is a weapon of her bitterness<ref>Fairlamb, Horace L. \"Romancing the Tao: How Ang Lee Globalized Ancient Chinese Wisdom\", ''symploke'' vol. 15, No. 1-2 (2007), p. 196.</ref> and quest for vengeance: she poisons the master of Wudang, attempts to poison Jen, and succeeds in killing Mu Bai using a poisoned needle. In further play on this theme by the director, Jade Fox, as she dies, refers to the poison from a young child, \"the deceit of an eight-year-old girl\", referring to what she considers her own spiritual poisoning by her young apprentice Jen. Li Mu Bai himself warns that, without guidance, Jen could become a \"poison dragon\".\n\n===China of the imagination===\nThe story is set during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912), but it does not specify an exact time.
