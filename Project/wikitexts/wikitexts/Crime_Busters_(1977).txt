Walsh and Kirby meet up and then leave the dock, tired of looking for a job. Matt is particularly intrigued by the closed nature of Wilbur, who tries to avoid it in any way. Matt, after introducing himself, suggests that Walsh and he should work together on something he had been planning; the robbery of a supermarket. Walsh accepts, aided by Kirby's conniving ways to remove police attention, but by mistake the two end up in the police station and, to prevent being locked away, they say that they want to become police officers, which is granted.\n\nBoth Matt and Wilbur complete their training, even though they differ in their unorthodox methods of making arrests and overall rebellious nature, eventually being on real service. During their job, Kirby becomes familiar with a Chinese family whose uncle was killed by unknown assailants. Upon investigation, the two come to face the same ruffians that spread to the port and denied them a job before. In fact, the criminals will be the key of \"the two superpied almost flat\" to get to the heart of the gang of traffickers.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{columnslist|\n*[[Bud Spencer]] as Wilbur Walsh\n*[[Terence Hill]] as  Matt Kirby\n*[[David Huddleston]] as  Captain McBride\n*[[Luciano Catenacci]] as  Fred Clyne\n*[[Riccardo Pizzuti]] as  Fred's henchman\n*Jill Flanter as  Galina Kocilova\n*April Clough as  Angie Crawford\n*[[Laura Gemser]] as  Susy Lee\n*[[Ezio Marano]] as Bloodsucker\n*[[Luciano Rossi]] as Geronimo\n*Luigi Casellato as Drugstore owner\n*Edy Biagetti as Lieutenant Governor\n*Giancarlo Bastianoni\n*Claudio Ruffini as Thug\n*Roberto Messina\n*Rocco Lerro\n*Roberto Del Acqua\n*Giovanni Ukmar\n*Duilio Olmi\n*Emilio Delle Piane as Pierre, Fred's waiter\n*[[Giovanni Cianfriglia]]\n*[[Fortunato Arena]] as Bouncer at Bowling\n*Ottaviano Dell'Acqua as Geronimo' s Man\n*Omero Capanna as Hitman\n*William Conroy as Man\n*John DiSanti as Orderly\n*Alex Edlin as Puncher in Football Stadium\n*Frank Nuyen as Mr. Lee\n*[[Osiride Pevarello]] as Circus Man\n*[[Pietro Torrisi]] as Fred's henchman\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn a contemporary review, ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' called ''Crime Busters'' \"a singularly dull variation on the sprightly, sparring Newman/Redford comedy formula\" and that there are a few original ideas in the script, but they were \"largely wasted by the lacklustre direction and the film's inevitable drift into an endless series of unimaginatively choreographed punch-ups.\"<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite magazine|title=Due superpiedi quasi piatti (Crime Busters)|last=Badder|first=David|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=1977|volume=44|issue=516|page=232}}</ref>\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, [[AllMovie]] called the film \"light but likeable stuff\" and that the appeal of the film depends \"solely on one's opinion of Hill and Spencer's antics.\"<ref name=\"allmovie\" /> The review also noted supporting roles, noting [[David Huddleston]] and [[Laura Gemser]].
