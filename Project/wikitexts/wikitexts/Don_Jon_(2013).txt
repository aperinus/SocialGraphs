The film grossed $41 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nJon Martello is a young Italian-American and modern-day [[Don Juan]] living and working as a bartender in New Jersey. He enjoys being independent and has a strict workout regimen, caring for his apartment and 1972 [[Chevrolet Chevelle SS]], and weekly family dinners. Though he prides himself on his active casual sex life, he is more satisfied by watching and masturbating to [[hardcore pornography]]. To atone for his sexual indiscretions, he completes weekly [[Catholic confession|confessions]] at church.\n\nAt a nightclub with his two best friends, Bobby and Danny, Jon becomes enamored with Barbara Sugarman, a beautiful young woman from an affluent background. Despite heavy flirting, she declines his offer for a one-night stand. Finding her on [[Facebook]], he invites her to lunch. There is mutual attraction, but Barbara insists on a long-term courtship and demands he always be honest. Their relationship proceeds over a month and without sex. She encourages Jon to take a nighttime [[community college]] class to obtain a career outside the service industry, and he indulges her love for romantic films, which he usually dismisses as fantasy. They meet each other's friends and families, and Jon's parents are immediately smitten by her.\n\nThey finally have sex, but Jon is still dissatisfied. He considers her body perfect, but still finds porn more satisfying. Barbara catches him watching porn, but he manages to convince her that it was a joke email sent by a friend. Their relationship resumes, with Jon concealing his habit from her as it becomes an addiction.\n\nAfter class, Jon catches Esther{{snd}}a middle-aged classmate{{snd}}weeping by herself, and when she sits next to him just before the next class to explain herself, she catches him watching porn on his cell phone. She teases him about the quality of the video but he brushes her off.\n\nBefore the next class Esther shocks him by handing him an erotic video that she believes has a more healthy depiction of sex, and after class they wind up having sex in her parked car. She asks why he loves porn so much, and he reveals that he wants to get lost in sex, but cannot do that with a partner. She persuades Jon to try masturbating without porn, but he is unable to. They continue having casual sex and she expresses the belief that he enjoys sex alone because he has not found a real intimate connection with a romantic partner and focuses on his own satisfaction. After suggesting they take a bath he finds her crying in the hall and she reveals that her husband and son died in a car accident just fourteen months earlier. The intimacy of that moment deepens their emotional connection and he experiences truly satisfying sex with her for the first time in his life.\n\nJon tells his family about the breakup with Barbara. While his parents are upset, his sister Monica tells him bluntly that Barbara's demands showed she wanted to date someone who allowed her to control him. Jon meets with Barbara and apologizes for lying to her. They discuss her expectations, which he asserts were unattainable, and she tells him to not to call her again.\n\nAlthough she is considerably older and neither of them has any interest in marriage, Jon and Esther happily begin dating.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Jon Martello Jr.\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Barbara Sugarman\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Esther\n* [[Tony Danza]] as Jon Martello Sr.\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Angela Martello\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Monica Martello\n* [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]] as Bobby\n* [[Jeremy Luke]] as Danny\n* [[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Priest\n* [[Lindsey Broad]] as Lauren\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Emily Lombardo\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Conner Verreaux\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Hollywood Actress #2\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Hollywood Actor #2\n* [[Sarah Dumont]] as Sequins\n* [[Italia Ricci]] as Gina\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Development|Writing}}\nDevelopment for ''Don Jon'' began in 2008, when Gordon-Levitt wrote early notes about the film.
