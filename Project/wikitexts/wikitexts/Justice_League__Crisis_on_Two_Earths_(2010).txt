It is based on the abandoned direct-to-video feature ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'', which was intended as a bridge between the then-concluding ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated television series and its then forthcoming sequel series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. ''Crisis on Two Earths'' was reworked from the ''Worlds Collide'' script to remove references to the TV series' continuity. The film is directed by [[Lauren Montgomery]] & [[Sam Liu]] and [[screenplay|written]] by [[Dwayne McDuffie]].<ref name=cbrobit>{{cite web |first=Kiel |last=Phegley |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=30969 |title=Milestone Creator Dwayne McDuffie has Died |publisher=Valnet Inc. |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 22, 2011 |access-date=July 1, 2016 |location=United States |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223160920/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=30969 |archive-date=February 23, 2011 |url-status=live }} (requires scrolldown)</ref>\n\nThe premise of ''Crisis on Two Earths'' is borrowed from the 1964 [[Gardner Fox]] ''Justice League of America'' #29\u201330 story entitled \"Crisis on Earth-Three!\" and the 2000 [[Grant Morrison]] ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' graphic novel, with a heroic [[Lex Luthor]] from an alternate universe coming to the [[Justice League]]'s universe for help against the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. The film is the seventh of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] released by [[Warner Premiere]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The two-disc special edition also includes an animated short [[DC Showcase: The Spectre|featuring the Spectre]].\n\nOn August 11, 2015, Warner Home Video re-released the film in a combo pack which includes a DVD and Blu-Ray copy, a digital copy, and the graphic novel on which it was based.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2022}}\nIn an [[parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]], heroic versions of [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the \"Quantum Trigger\" from the headquarters of the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] (villainous version of the [[Justice League]]). When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (evil versions of [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Hawkgirl]] respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members ([[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]], [[Superwoman]], [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]) but escapes to the Earth of the Justice League by activating a device that enables interdimensional travels.\n\nLuthor locates a police station, but is mistaken for the evil Luthor and ends up strip-searched. The Justice League is summoned and [[Superman]]'s [[x-ray]] vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that their Luthor is still incarcerated at [[Stryker's Island]]. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of [[Batman]], the rest of the Justice League (Superman, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Wally West|Flash]] and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth.\n\nArriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]], who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives, e.g. hardly anyone would be brave enough to testify against the Syndicate, lest it be nearly impossible to guarantee safety until trial. His daughter, [[Rose Wilson|Rose]], however, regards him as a coward. Martian Manhunter inadvertently reads her mind and explains that as a military man her father actually holds life more dear than others. Martian Manhunter later foils an assassination attempt on Rose by Archer (an evil version of [[Green Arrow]]), and the pair fall in love.\n\nOwlman has developed a weapon, the Quantum Eigenstate Device or Q.E.D., which the Syndicate intend to use as the equalizer to the threat of a nuclear reprisal. When pressed by Superwoman, Owlman reveals that he's secretly planning to overthrow Ultraman and take control of the Crime Syndicate. He also admits the weapon can [[Planet killer|destroy entire worlds]]. Believing there are many parallel Earths, and that each one develops from the choices that each person makes, Owlman becomes obsessed with the idea that [[nihilism|nothing he does can possibly matter]], as there will always be parallel worlds where he explored another option. As a result, he searches for [[Earth Prime#DC Comics|Earth Prime]], the very first Earth from which all other universes originated, intending to use the Q.E.D. to spark a chain reaction that will erase the entire multiverse. Superwoman is excited by the idea and agrees to help him. Owlman sends Superwoman with three of her lieutenants to the League's dimension, and on the Watchtower, they battle Batman, [[Aquaman]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Firestorm (character)|Firestorm]], and [[Red Tornado]]. Superwoman and one of her lieutenants escape with the Quantum Trigger but are followed by Batman.\n\nAfter a fight that ended with him gaining a broken rib, Batman defeats Superwoman and summons the League. Johnny, hopeful to reinstate fear in the Syndicate, decides to come down to commit big crimes. Power Ring rejects this because Scarlet Archer had been arrested by J'onn. Rose decides to learn the location of the Syndicate base to allow the Justice League to confront them. The League arrives at the Crime Syndicate's moon-base with the captive Superwoman, and eventually battle the Syndicate. Owlman fights off Batman and takes the Q.E.D. bomb to Earth-Prime, finding it to be uninhabited and lifeless, having suffered an unknown cataclysm that caused it to leave solar orbit. Luthor speculates that a speedster might be able to vibrate and match the temporal vibration of the teleported Q.E.D. device and open a portal. Flash volunteers but Batman states that he isn't fast enough, only [[Johnny Quick]] is. Johnny agrees and opens a portal.\n\nBatman pursues Owlman to Earth-Prime, where they engage in a brutal battle. Owlman espouses his nihilistic philosophy, claiming that Mankind destroyed Earth-Prime, and that destroying Man in every universe is the only possible real choice to make. As they fight, both of them notice how similar they are to one another. Batman eventually manages to teleport Owlman and the Q.E.D. device to another uninhabited Earth, but not before telling Owlman, \u201cThere is a difference between you and me. We both looked into the abyss. But when it looked back, you blinked.\u201d Seeing that the Q.E.D. is triggered, Owlman does not attempt to defuse the bomb, simply saying \"It doesn't matter,\u201d with a smirk and allowing the bomb to destroy the alternate Earth, killing himself in the process. Batman returns to the Syndicate's Earth, where the strain of acting as a vibratory conduit has exhausted Johnny Quick to near death. Before dying, Johnny correctly deduces Batman lied about Flash not being fast enough and knew what would happen. Despite this, he shows no ill will toward Batman and appreciates Batman\u2019s ruse, dying with a smile. Martian Manhunter returns, accompanied by President Wilson and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], and together they arrest Ultraman, Superwoman, and Power Ring.\n\nWilson thanks the heroes for helping save their world and tells them he had ordered the National Guard to support the local police forces and resume on arresting the remaining members of the Syndicate. Although Rose asks Martian Manhunter to remain with her, the group return to their dimension. Batman and Superman later discuss a membership drive with the five heroes summoned previously greeting the Justice League while Wonder Woman keeps [[Invisible Plane|Owlman\u2019s invisible jet]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Baldwin]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as [[Superman|Clark Kent / Superman]]\n* [[Chris Noth]] as [[Lex Luthor]]\n* [[Gina Torres]] as [[Superwoman]]<ref name=\"cbr1\">{{cite web|url=http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showpost.php?p=10558994&postcount=21 |title=Who wants Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths spoilers? - Page 2 - Comic Book Resources Forums |publisher=Forums.comicbookresources.com |date=2010-02-14 |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n* [[James Woods]] as [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]\n* [[Brian Bloom]] as [[Ultraman (DC Comics)|Ultraman]]<ref name=\"cbr1\"/><ref name=\"wfo2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=638 |title=The World's Finest - New Image, Cast Details For Upcoming \"Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths\" Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter]]<ref name=\"wfo1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=629 |title=The World's Finest - New Images, Cast Details For Upcoming \"Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths\" Feature |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n* [[Josh Keaton]] as [[Flash (Wally West)|Wally West / The Flash]] (credited), [[Aquaman]] (uncredited)<ref>{{cite tweet|last=Keaton |first=Josh |user=joshkeaton|number=9511355800 |title=Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths comes out tomorrow!
