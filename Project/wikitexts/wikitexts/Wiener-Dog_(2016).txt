Starring an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Kieran Culkin]], [[Julie Delpy]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Greta Gerwig]], [[Tracy Letts]], and [[Zosia Mamet]], the film serves as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from Solondz's 1995 film ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'', which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. The film is also inspired by the 1966 drama ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]'', directed by [[Robert Bresson]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2016.<ref name=\"sundancekids\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sundance.org/blogs/news/premieres-spotlight-sundance-kids-and-special-events-announced-for-2016-festival|title=Sundance Institute Completes Feature Film Lineup For 2016 Sundance Film Festival|first=Elizabeth|last=Latenser|publisher=[[The Sundance Institute]]|work=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|date=December 7, 2015|access-date=December 19, 2015}}</ref> before receiving a [[limited release]] on June 24, 2016, by [[Amazon Studios]] and [[IFC Films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/features/summer-heat-fji-previews-whats-in-store-for-warm-weather-moviegoing|title=Summer Heat: FJI previews what's in store for warm-weather moviegoing|website=[[Film Journal International]]|first=Rebecca|last=Pahle|date=April 8, 2016|access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDanny brings his cancer-surviving son Remi a [[dachshund|wiener dog]]. His wife Dina does not want to deal with caring for the dog, but Danny informs her Remi is mature and old enough to help the two with the responsibilities. Dina brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to get [[Neutering|spayed]], and on their way, Remi becomes upset. Dina comforts Remi by telling him an embellished story about her childhood dog, which she claims died after giving birth to a litter of stillborn puppies. During Dina and Danny's [[yoga]] class, Remi and Wiener-Dog tear up the couch cushions and cover the living room in feathers. Wiener Dog wanders off into the kitchen, and Remi feeds her a [[chocolate]] chip [[granola bar]]. Wiener-Dog becomes very ill and spreads [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]] around the house. The next day Danny brings Wiener-Dog to the vet to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]].\n\nAt the vet, veterinary nurse Dawn Wiener takes Wiener-Dog from the consultation room before the vet can euthanise her. She brings Wiener-Dog home with her, where she nurses the dog back to life. It is loosely implied that she is estranged from her family. One day while shopping for pet food, she runs into her old ex boyfriend (from junior high) Brandon, who invites her to visit his brother Tommy and his wife April, both with [[Down syndrome]], in Ohio. Dawn agrees, and the two head off to [[Ohio]], where they come across homesick Mexican hitchhikers. Once they arrive in Ohio, Brandon informs his brother that their father had died due to [[alcoholism]]. Tommy asks Brandon to stop doing drugs, and Brandon promises he has stopped, even though he was shown injecting drugs earlier in the trip. Dawn offers to leave Wiener-Dog with Tommy and April, who happily accept. On their way home, Dawn and Brandon talk about their future together and happily hold hands.\n\nDuring an intermission, Wiener-Dog is seen wandering across America, via strip clubs, motels and crime scenes.\n\nWiener-Dog then arrives with Dave Schmerz, a [[Film professor|screenwriting professor]] who is attempting to get his second screenplay off the ground. One day at work, Schmerz is informed that various students and administration members are complaining about his constant negativity. In the meeting he tearfully explains that he had tried to put real emotion into his script but he compromised and added funny elements to make it more commercial, thus ruining it. Schmerz is asked to attend a discussion with a previous student who became a famous [[film director]], who mocks Schmerz's teaching and encourages the students to drop out. Schmerz creates a bomb and attaches it to Wiener-Dog. Students notice and contact authorities. Dave gets stopped by authorities investigating the incident on the way home and willingly identifies himself.\n\nElderly Nana, who lives with her caregiver Yvette, is Wiener-Dog's final owner. She names her \"Cancer.\" Nana receives a call from her granddaughter Zoe, who is on her way to visit for the first time in several years, along with her boyfriend Fantasy, a conceptual artist. Once Zoe arrives, she asks for money in order to pay for Fantasy's new art project. Nana agrees to give her the money. While filling out the check, Zoe confides in her Nana, wondering if Fantasy is cheating on her. Once Zoe leaves, Nana goes outside and sits with Wiener-Dog, where she dreams about a younger version of herself coming back to show her what her life could have been if she had been more positive. She wakes up to discover Wiener-Dog has run away. She then spots Wiener-Dog being run over and killed by a truck.\n\nSix months later, a stuffed animatronic Wiener-Dog is displayed in Fantasy's art exhibit.\n\n==Cast==\n'''First story'''\n* [[Keaton
