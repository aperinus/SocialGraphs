Set during the [[Battle of Normandy]] in [[World War II]], the film is known for its graphic portrayal of war, especially its depiction of the [[Omaha Beach]] assault during the [[Normandy landings]]. The film follows [[United States Army Rangers]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] John H. Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) and his squad ([[Tom Sizemore]], [[Edward Burns]], [[Barry Pepper]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Vin Diesel]], [[Adam Goldberg]], and [[Jeremy Davies]]) as they search for a [[paratrooper]], [[Private first class]] James Francis Ryan ([[Matt Damon]]), the [[Sole Survivor Policy|last surviving brother]] of four, the three other brothers having been killed in action. The film was a co-production between [[DreamWorks Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Amblin Entertainment]], and [[Mutual Film Company]]. DreamWorks distributed the film in North America while Paramount released the film internationally.\n\nRodat first wrote the script in 1994 after reading about the [[Niland brothers]], and by 1996 producer [[Mark Gordon (film)|Mark Gordon]] acquired the rights to Rodat's script. After eleven rewrites, Gordon began developing the project at Paramount.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/27/movies/ryan-lands-with-impact-in-theaters-across-us.html|title='Ryan' Lands With Impact in Theaters Across U.S.|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 2, 2018|archive-date=September 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903015259/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/27/movies/ryan-lands-with-impact-in-theaters-across-us.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Spielberg, who at the time was forming DreamWorks, was eventually hired by Paramount to direct the film while DreamWorks would co-finance as part of a deal. After the cast went through training supervised by [[United States Marines|Marine]] veteran [[Dale Dye]], the film's principal photography started in June 1997 and lasted two months. The film's [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of [[Curracloe]], [[County Wexford]], Ireland, and used members of the [[Irish Army]] reserve as extras to portray infantry for the D-Day landing.\n\n''Saving Private Ryan'' received publicity for its graphic depiction of violence and war, with Spielberg himself expecting the film to receive a [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|NC-17 rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]]. On its release, ''Saving Private Ryan'' became the [[1998 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide]] with $485 million worldwide, behind ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''. The film received critical acclaim from critics and audiences, who praised the performances, realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's direction. Topping many film critics' 1998 top ten lists and winning numerous awards, ''Saving Private Ryan'' won five [[Academy Awards]], including Spielberg\u2019s second [[Academy Award for Best Director]], though it lost the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] to ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' in a controversial Oscars upset. The film solidified Damon\u2019s rising star power and would strengthen a collaborative relationship between Spielberg and Hanks, while the film also helped Diesel launch his career. \n\nIn the years since its release'', Saving Private Ryan'' has maintained its reputation as one of the greatest and most influential films of the 1990s, one of the greatest war and action films of all time, and [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]], and some declaring it as Spielberg's best film.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Conner Schwerdtfeger |date=2018-04-04 |title=Why Saving Private Ryan Is Still Steven Spielberg's Best Movie |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2397922/why-saving-private-ryan-is-still-steven-spielbergs-best-movie |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=CINEMABLEND |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Classic Feature: The Making Of Saving Private Ryan |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/saving-private-ryan-classic-feature/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=Empire}}</ref> Hailed as an influential landmark in the war and action film genres, the film helped depict war and action scenes with a stronger emphasis on realism while helping influence cinematography due to its use of desaturated colors, [[hand-held camera]]s, and tight angles.<ref name=\"nytimes1998\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/24/movies/film-review-panoramic-and-personal-visions-of-war-s-anguish.html|title=FILM REVIEW; Panoramic and Personal Visions of War's Anguish|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|date=July 24, 1998|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 25, 2018|language=en|author-link=Janet Maslin|archive-date=July 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725122833/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/24/movies/film-review-panoramic-and-personal-visions-of-war-s-anguish.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-saving-private-ryan-20-story.html|title='Saving Private Ryan' at 20: How Spielberg's vivid D-Day story changed war movies forever|last1=Rubin|first1=Steven Jay|date=July 24, 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=July 25, 2018|archive-date=June 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626110430/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-saving-private-ryan-20-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6054189/Top-ten-war-films-Saving-Private-Ryan-claims-No-1-spot.html|title=Top ten war films: Saving Private Ryan claims No 1 spot|date=August 19, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=July 25, 2018|archive-date=July 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725122816/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6054189/Top-ten-war-films-Saving-Private-Ryan-claims-No-1-spot.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It has also been credited for renewing interest in World War II media, particularly World War II-themed [[First-person shooter|first-person shooter games]] that became popular in the 2000s.

At a specific grave, he is overcome with emotion and begins to recall his time as a soldier.\n\nOn the morning of June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at [[Omaha Beach]] as part of the [[Normandy landings|Normandy invasion]]. [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] John H. Miller leads his command, Company C, 2nd Ranger Battalion in a [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] from the beach. The staff at the [[United States Department of War]] learns that James Francis Ryan of the [[101st Airborne Division]] is missing and presumed to be the last survivor of four brothers who are all in the military. [[General (United States)|General]] [[George C. Marshall]] orders Ryan to be found and sent home so that his family will not lose all its sons.\n\nMiller is ordered to lead a detachment in finding Ryan. As they arrive in the contested town of [[Neuville-au-Plain|Neuville]] between [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German defenders]] and the 101st Airborne, Caparzo is killed by a German sniper. Miller and his men find a paratrooper named Ryan but he is not the one for whom they are searching, and they are directed to a rally point where James Francis Ryan's unit should be. Miller learns that Ryan is defending a key bridge in the town of Ramelle. ''En route'', Miller decides against the judgment of his soldiers to neutralize a German machine gun nest, which results in Wade's death. A surviving German soldier is spared by the intervention of Upham, the detachment's interpreter, who is unused to the horrors of combat. Miller blindfolds the soldier, who has been nicknamed \"[[Steamboat Willie]]\", and orders him to surrender to the next [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] patrol. When Reiben threatens to desert, Miller defuses the situation by calmly telling a story that reveals his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, of which he has not previously spoken, and which has been the subject of much speculation among his men.\n\nUpon arriving in Ramelle, Miller's detachment makes contact with Ryan and informs him of his brothers' deaths. Though upset, Ryan refuses to abandon his post defending the town's bridge. The town soon comes under siege by attacking Germans, and Miller assumes command as the only officer present. He and his unit fight alongside the 101st, but the German armor advantage takes a toll on the Americans. Jackson, Mellish and Horvath are killed in the fighting, and Steamboat Willie shoots Miller as he attempts to blow up the bridge with pre-placed explosives. American [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighter planes and [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] arrive and halt the German advance. Upham confronts Steamboat Willie, who attempts to talk Upham into letting him go again; now aware of the difficult choices soldiers make during war, Upham shoots and kills him. The mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to \"earn this\" referring to the sacrifices others have made so that Ryan can have a postwar life.\n\nRyan is revealed to be the elderly veteran and the grave to be Miller's. Ryan expresses gratitude for the sacrifices made by Miller and his men, says he hopes he \"earned it\", and salutes the grave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n<!-- First 19 (Hanks to Orser) and order per tombstone closing credits, except Damon moved up from between Ribisi and Farina per film poster; roles per closing credits scroll and direct observations from film itself by various editors(?) -->\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] John H.

Last update: March 9, 2010</ref>\n\nThere are some historical inaccuracies in the film's depiction of the Normandy campaign. At the time of the mission, US forces from the two American beach areas, [[Utah Beach|Utah]] and Omaha, had not yet linked up.<ref>On June 12, 1944, three days after the fictional Ryan mission was to begin, Carentan was finally captured after heavy fighting, and US forces operating out of the two beaches finally linked up. See Messenger, Charles, ''The Chronological Atlas of World War Two'' (New York: Macmillan Publishing, 1989), 182.</ref> In reality, a Ranger team operating out of the Omaha Beach area would have had to move through the German-occupied city of [[Carentan]], or swim or boat across the estuary linking Carentan to the [[English Channel]], or transfer by boat to the Utah landing area. On the other hand, US forces moving out of Utah Beach would have had direct and much shorter routes, relatively unencumbered by enemy positions, and were already in contact with some teams from both US airborne divisions landed in the area.<ref>[[Cornelius Ryan|Ryan, Cornelius]], ''[[The Longest Day: June 6, 1944]]'' (New York: Popular Library, 1959), 286-8.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the Utah Beach landings were relatively uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha.<ref>Out of 23,000 men landed at Utah, 197 were casualties on the first day, while 55,000 men landed at Omaha with 4,649 casualties. See Messenger, 181.</ref> The filmmakers chose to begin the narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the historical inaccuracies it would create. In addition, the film depicts the [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]] as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle; in fact, there is no town called Ramelle and the 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at [[Battle for Caen|Caen]] against the British and Canadians, 100 miles to the east (160&nbsp;km).<ref>{{cite web | access-date=September 5, 2008 | url=http://dasreich.ca/normandy.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208095306/http://dasreich.ca/normandy.html | archive-date=December 8, 2010 | title=Normandy and Falaise\u2014April to August 1944 | publisher=Das Reich}}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Merderet River]] bridges were not an objective of the [[101st Airborne Division]] but of the [[82nd Airborne Division]], part of [[Mission Boston]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=September 5, 2008 | url=http://www.6juin1944.com/assaut/aeropus/en_index.php | title=U.S. Airborne in Cotentin Peninsula | publisher=D-Day: Etats des Lieux | archive-date=October 12, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012123248/http://www.6juin1944.com/assaut/aeropus/en_index.php | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMuch has also been said about various \"tactical errors\" made by both the German and American forces in the film's climactic battle.

In the ruined village of Ramelle, a spelling mistake in French can be observed on a mural advertisement, where the word ''estomac'' is erroneously spelled ''estomach''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lavitrinesuze.free.fr/lvs_V1/Pages/Insolite/lvsryan.html |title=Insolite |access-date=June 27, 2021 |archive-date=June 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607143538/http://lavitrinesuze.free.fr/lvs_V1/Pages/Insolite/lvsryan.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nTo achieve a tone and quality that were true to the story as well as reflected the period in which it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]], saying, \"Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a [[Technicolor]] extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech.\"\n\nKami\u0144ski had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s.
