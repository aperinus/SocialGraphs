Based on the 1989 novel of the same name by [[Russell Banks]], the film stars [[Nick Nolte]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Willem Dafoe]].\n\n''Affliction'' had its world premiere at the [[54th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 28, 1997, and was released in the United States on December 30, 1998, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lions Gate Films]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, who mostly lauded the performances of Nolte and Coburn. At the [[71st Academy Awards]], Nolte was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and Coburn won for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. It earned six nominations at the [[14th Independent Spirit Awards]], including [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film|Best Feature]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/affliction-leads-way-in-indie-spirit-noms-1117490004/|title='Affliction' leads way in indie Spirit noms|last=Klady|first=Leonard|date=January 7, 1999|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=August 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jan-08-ca-61444-story.html|title='Affliction' Tops Spirit Nods; 'High Art' Is Second in Tally|last=Munoz|first=Lorenza|date=January 8, 1999|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=August 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRolfe Whitehouse begins the film, announcing the story of his brother Wade's \"strange criminal behavior\" and subsequent disappearance.\n\nWade Whitehouse is a small-town policeman in [[New Hampshire]]. On [[Halloween]] night, Wade meets his daughter Jill, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother, Wade's ex-wife, to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her lover against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter.\n\nThe next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. Jack Hewitt, a local hunting guide, claims that Evan Twombley, with whom he was hunting, accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man's death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction.\n\nA while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade's alcoholic father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from [[hypothermia]]. Glen reacts to her death with little surprise, and later gets drunk at her wake and gets into a fight with Wade.\n\nRolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade's murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town [[Board of selectmen|Selectman]] Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off.\n\nFinally, Wade is fired for harassing Jack and trashing Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates him over his plans to sue for full custody. At a local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay, but Jill rushes up and tries to stop the fight. In response, Wade angrily pushes Jill, giving her a bloody nose forcing both her and Margie to drive off.\n\nWade is then approached by Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a \"real man\". The latent aggression between the men culminates in another fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father. He burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking.\n\nRolfe's narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack's truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere, but having nothing to do with either Jack or Twombley. Rolfe concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*  [[Nick Nolte]] as Wade Whitehouse\n*  [[James Coburn]] as Glen Whitehouse\n*  [[Sissy Spacek]] as Margie Fogg\n*  [[Willem Dafoe]] as Rolfe Whitehouse\n*  [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Lillian Whitehouse\n*  Brigid Tierney as Jill Whitehouse\n*  [[Holmes Osborne]] as Gordon LaRiviere\n*  [[Jim True-Frost]] as Jack Hewitt\n*  Tim Post as Chick Ward\n*  [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Frankie Lacoy\n*  [[Marian Seldes]] as Alma Pittman\n*  [[Janine Theriault]] as Hettie Rogers\n*  Paul Stewart as Mr. Horner\n*  [[Wayne Robson]] as Nick Wickham\n*  [[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]] as Evan Twombley\n*  Sheena Larkin as Lugene Brooks\n*  Penny Mancuso as Woman Driver\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Paul Schrader, he came across a paperback copy of the novel in a bookstore and bought it after he was \"grabbed\" by its first sentence.  After he finished reading the book, Schrader bought the film rights from Russell Banks.<ref name=filmmaker>{{cite magazine|last=Zeman|first=Josh|title=Sins of the Father|date=Winter 1998|magazine=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1998/sins.php|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name=book>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p76wGKfve54C&q=nick%20nolte%20affliction&pg=PT253|last=Emery|first=Robert J.|title=The Directors: Take Three|year=2003|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781621531159}}{{page needed |date=May 2017}}</ref>  The director said in an interview with ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]'' that he identified with the characters in the story: \"I had a very strong father and an older male sibling.

I like some sense of moral grace. But ''Affliction'' is pretty bleak at the end.\"<ref name=filmmaker/>  He also added, \"I view the film as a collaboration between myself and Russell Banks.\"<ref name=filmmaker/>\n\nNick Nolte was Schrader's first choice for the role of Wade Whitehouse.

Although Nolte was interested in playing Wade, Schrader could not afford him at first.

When Schrader encouraged the actor to prepare for the role, Coburn reportedly said in response, \"Oh, you mean you want me to really act? I can do that. I haven't often been asked to, but I can.\"<ref name=ebert/>\n\nSchrader claimed that Willem Dafoe wanted to play the part of Wade.<ref name=filmmaker/>  Dafoe himself would admit, \"I knew I couldn't play Wade Whitehouse whether Nick Nolte was around or not.\"  Schrader instead offered Dafoe the role of Rolfe Whitehouse, and the latter accepted it because he loved the novel.  According to Dafoe, Schrader showed him the novel during the making of ''[[Light Sleeper]]''.<ref name=charlierose/>\n\n''Affliction'' was filmed in [[Quebec]], with principal shooting starting in February 1997. Although first presented at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on August 28 the same year, ''Affliction'' did not see a theatrical release until some time later in most countries.
