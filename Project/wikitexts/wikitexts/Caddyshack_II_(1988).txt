Directed by [[Allan Arkush]] and written by [[Harold Ramis]] (who co-wrote and directed the original ''Caddyshack'') and [[PJ Torokvei]], it stars [[Jackie Mason]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Dina Merrill]], [[Jonathan Silverman]], [[Brian McNamara]], [[Marsha Warfield]], [[Paul Bartel]], and [[Randy Quaid]] with special appearances by [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. While the writing of the film is officially credited to Ramis and Torokvei, the first-draft script by Ramis and Torokvei was rewritten by other uncredited writers.\n\nThe sequel was panned by critics and is considered one of the worst sequels of all time.<ref name=\"SI\" /> However, [[Kenny Loggins]]' \"[[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|Nobody's Fool]]\" which was used as the film's theme song was a chart success where it hit #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\n== Plot ==\nKate Hartounian is the teenage daughter of Jack, a wealthy and widowed real estate developer of [[Armenian-American|Armenian]] and [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] descent. Eager to improve her social status, Kate befriends the [[snob]]bish [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestants|WASP]] Miffy Young, who encourages Kate and the boorish but good-hearted Jack to join their [[country club]], Bushwood (the same club from the first film).\n\nWhen the elitist, [[old money]] members of Bushwood meet self-made millionaire Jack, who builds [[Affordable housing|low-income housing]] in upscale neighborhoods and displays many working-class traits, his application to join is rejected. The only member of the club who takes a liking to the crude, but friendly Jack is wealthy widow Elizabeth Pearce. Jack runs afoul of the snobbish Chandler Young (Bushwood President and Miffy's father), who declares the Hartounians \"are not Bushwood material.\" Chandler's equally snooty wife Cynthia tries to persuade Jack to build his housing complex away from her neighborhood, leading Jack to chase her with a bulldozer. Jack's behavior upsets Kate, harming their relationship. \n\nIn retaliation to being blackballed by the club, Jack turns to his friend, millionaire Ty Webb who owns the majority share of Bushwood but otherwise stays out of the club's day-to-day operations. Jack buys Ty's stock in the club - making himself majority owner - and turns Bushwood into a garish amusement park, appalling Chandler and the other club members. Chandler shuts down Jack's housing construction site by establishing a Historical Preservation Society and sending his lawyers to threaten Jack's lawyer Peter Blunt with endless legal motions and filings intended to financially bankrupt Jack. \n\nTy Webb suggests that the dispute between Jack and Young be resolved by the two men facing each other in a golf match, stipulating if Chandler wins, Jack gives up his construction site and the country club, and if Jack wins, he keeps Bushwood and the housing project. Chandler hedges his bet by hiring Captain Tom Everett, an incompetent mercenary operating out of a [[food truck]], to kill Jack. Everett's mission is derailed by the antics of a mischievous gopher running rampant on the grounds of Bushwood.\n\nDespite Jack's poor performance early in the match, he manages to tie the score before the final hole. However, while playing the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt, while Chandler faces a simple two-foot putt. Employing advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy two-foot putt to tie the match. Meanwhile, Everett, who had shot himself in the buttocks with a poison dart, fails to eliminate Jack as the gopher steals an explosive golf ball from him. The gopher quietly replaces Chandler's ball with the explosive ball. As Chandler putts the ball, it bursts and Jack wins the match.\n\nKate commiserates with Miffy, who suggests that she change her last name from Hartounian to Hart. Although she is embarrassed by her father's actions, Kate is still loyal to Jack and is bewildered at the thought of changing her family name. Kate turns her back on Miffy and makes up with her father. Jack asks Elizabeth out on a date and she accepts. The gopher pops out of the hole during the celebration and falls for a poodle.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jackie Mason]] as Jack Hartounian, a wealthy and widowed real estate developer who becomes involved in Bushwood Country Club.\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Chandler Young, the snobbish President of Bushwood Country Club.\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Elizabeth Pearce, a wealthy widow that befriends Jack.\n* [[Dina Merrill]] as Cynthia Young, the snobbish wife of Chandler Young.\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Harry\n* [[Brian McNamara]] as Todd Young, the son of Chandler and Cynthia Young.\n* [[Marsha Warfield]] as Royette Tyler\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as Mr. Jamison\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Peter Blunt, Jack's lawyer who can get temperamental at times.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Ty Webb, the son of one of Bushwood Country Club's founders who is a friend of Jack.\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Captain Tom Everett, an incompetent mercenary hired by Chandler to dispose of Jack who runs afoul of a gopher.\n* [[Jessica Lundy]] as Kate Hartounian, the daughter of Jack Hartounian.\n* [[Chynna Phillips]] as Mary Frances 'Miffy' Young, a snobbish [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] who is the daughter of Chandler Young.\n* Anthony Mockus Sr. as Mr. Pierpont\n* [[Bibi Osterwald]] as Mrs. Pierpont\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of the Gopher\n}}\n\n== Preproduction ==\nThe original ''Caddyshack'' was a box-office success, making $60 million worldwide on a budget of $4.8 million. [[Warner Brothers]] therefore set about to make a sequel. As originally planned, ''Caddyshack II'' would have reunited [[Rodney Dangerfield]] (one of the stars of the original ''Caddyshack'') with the director [[Alan Metter]], who had worked with Dangerfield in the comedy film ''[[Back to School]]'' (1986). Dangerfield, who made $35,000 for ''Caddyshack'', asked for $7 million \u2013 of which $5 million was to be paid in advance \u2013 to reprise his Al Czervic role in ''Caddyshack II.'' Needing a big comedy for the summer of 1988, Warner Brothers agreed to Dangerfield\u2019s demands and paid [[Chevy Chase]] a seven-figure sum to reprise his role of Ty Webb from the original ''Caddyshack'' (albeit via a glorified cameo).<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite web |date=July 24, 2020 |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |title=The Inside Story of Caddyshack II |url=https://www.si.com/media/2020/07/24/caddyshack-2-worst-sequel-ever-inside-story |website=[[Sports Illustrated]] |access-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726104124/https://www.si.com/media/2020/07/24/caddyshack-2-worst-sequel-ever-inside-story |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Jon Peters]], executive producer of ''Caddyshack'', would produce the sequel with [[Peter Guber]] and [[Neil Canton]]. The studio invited ''Caddyshack'' director [[Harold Ramis]], who co-wrote that film with [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] and [[Douglas Kenney]], to write the sequel. (Neither Doyle-Murray nor Kenney were involved in the sequel; ''Caddyshack'' producer/co-writer Kenney died in August 1980, a month after that film's release.)\n\nRamis later described ''Caddyshack II'', which he co-wrote with his ''[[Second City Television]]'' colleague PJ Torokvei, as \"terrible.\"<ref name=\"avclub\">{{cite web |date= 1999-03-03 |author= Joshua Klein |url= https://www.avclub.com/harold-ramis-1798207996 |title=Harold Ramis Interview |work= [[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=21 December 2010}}</ref> In an interview with [[The A.V. Club]] in 1999, Ramis said that:\n\n{{cquote|...with ''Caddyshack II'', the studio begged me. They said, \"Hey, we've got a great idea: 'The Shack is Back!'\" And I said \"No, I don't think so.\" But they said that Rodney really wanted to do it, and we could build it around Rodney. Rodney said, \"Come on, do it.\" Then the classic argument came up which says that if you don't do it, someone will, and it will be really bad. So I worked on a script with my partner Peter Torokvei, consulting with Rodney all the time. Then Rodney got into a fight with the studio and backed out. We had some success with ''Back to School'', which I produced and wrote, and we were working with the same director, Alan Metter. When Rodney pulled out, I pulled out, and then they fired Alan and got someone else. I got a call from [co-producer] [[Jon Peters]] saying, \"Come with us to New York; we're going to see [[Jackie Mason]]!\" I said, \"Ooh, don't do this. Why don't we let it die?\" And he said, \"No, it'll be great.\" But I didn't go, and they got other writers to finish it. I tried to take my name off that one, but they said if I took my name off, it would come out in the trades and I would hurt the film.\"<ref name=\"avclub\" />}}\n\nRamis was later quoted as saying that Dangerfield was the only one who expressed an interest in doing a sequel in the first place. [[Ted Knight]] had died two years earlier, [[Bill Murray]] was not interested in reprising his role as Carl the greenskeeper, and he said [[Chevy Chase]] had \"already moved on\", although Chase did eventually agree to appear.\n\nRamis worked on the first draft of ''Caddyshack II'' in the summer of 1987 with Torokvei. Rodney Dangerfield did not like the script and requested rewrites. Growing disillusioned with the project, Dangerfield reportedly tried to force Warner Brothers to release him from his contract by demanding additional royalties and final-cut rights. In October 1987, less than a month before ''Caddyshack II'' was scheduled to begin filming and with $2 million already spent by the studio on pre-production, Dangerfield dropped out of the project because he felt it would not be successful.<ref name=\"spt\">{{cite news|title=Dangerfield is picky about scripts for his movies|last=Beck|first=Marilyn|date=September 27, 1988|work=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref> Warner Brothers sued Dangerfield for breach of contract.<ref name=\"ds\">{{cite news|title=Dangerfield Sued|date=November 4, 1987|work=Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel}}</ref> Early in the hearings, the studio settled with Dangerfield for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=\"SI\" />\n\nThe project was put on hold while Warner Brothers looked for a new director, eventually landing upon [[Allan Arkush]]. A former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Roger Corman]] and collaborator of [[Joe Dante]], Arkush directed several motion pictures (including the 1979 cult hit ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'') before becoming a prolific director of episodic television, with credits including ''[[L.A. Law]]'', ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', and ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. Arkush was keen to get back into directing films, later recalling, \"I had a really successful run on television. ''Moonlighting'' was a big deal, I was doing ''L.A. Law'', working on pilots and I had a deal with Warner Brothers to direct and they said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s another ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' movie.\u201d ''National Lampoon Goes to College'' and I thought, \u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d They couldn\u2019t get it bought. So they asked, \u201cHow would you like to make ''Caddyshack II''?\u201d<ref name=\"BSM\">{{cite web|url=https://bandsaboutmovies.com/2021/12/07/exclusive-interview-with-allan-arkush/|title=Exclusive interview with Allan Arkush|work=B&S About Movies|date=7 December 2021|archive-date=17 February 2022}}</ref>\n\nAfter the offer was made, Arkush rented and watched the original ''Caddyshack'' and signed on to direct the sequel. He was not aware at the time of the litigation between the studio and Rodney Dangerfield.\n\n==Production==\nIt was only after agreeing to direct ''Caddyshack II'' that Allan Arkush realized how much trouble the project was in: production began in late 1987 and Warner Brothers still insisted upon a summer 1988 release, meaning only half a year for principal photography and post-production. Adding to this difficulty was the fact the project was in no shape to begin filming. Arkush later claimed, \u201cThe more I got into it, the more I realized that they didn\u2019t have a script that was in any kind of shape, they didn\u2019t have Bill Murray and now they didn\u2019t have Rodney Dangerfield.\u201d Arkush likened his assignment \u201cto hopping onto a moving ship barreling full steam ahead.\u201d<ref name=\"SI\" />\n\nScreenwriters [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]], who scripted ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), were brought in to overhaul Ramis and Torokvei\u2019s script (although they would ultimately receive no official credit for doing so). With Rodney Dangerfield out of the picture, the screenplay replaced Al Czervic with Jack Hartounian, a new character to be played by Jackie Mason - like Dangerfield, a [[Jewish-American]] [[Borsch Belt]] [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. After witnessing Mason's one-man comedy act on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the insistence of producer Jon Peters, Allan Arkush was concerned about the comedian's suitability for the film: \u201cThe thing that occurred to me was that [Mason] didn\u2019t connect with the audience in any sort of personal way. That\u2019s not necessarily a good thing for someone who\u2019s supposed to be your lead. At least when Rodney says, \u2018I get no respect,\u2019 there\u2019s an empathy that he evokes from the audience.\u201d<ref name=\"SI\" /> Arkush also stated, \"[Mason] is a very funny joke machine and you laugh yourself silly. I needed a comedian who was equally an actor. I went to the producer Jon Peters and told him my fears. He was so convinced that Jackie was a brilliant comedian and could pull it off. Jon looked me in the eye and said, \u201cDon\u2019t turn a Go picture into a development deal.\u201d I should have walked away.\"<ref name=\"BSM\" /> Mason's casting in ''Caddyshack II'' was publicly announced by ''[[Daily Variety]]'' on November 17, 1987. Of his role as Jack Hartounian, Mason said, \"What I like about [him] is that he's more concerned with the way people treat each other than whether they use the right words in polite society or raise the proper finger to drink a glass of beer.\"\n\nChevy Chase was the only cast member from the original ''Caddyshack'' to reprise his role (and would publicly announce later that he regretted doing so). [[Bill Murray]] refused to reprise his Carl Spackler role, opting to make ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988) instead. Murray's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' colleague [[Dan Aykroyd]] signed on in Murray's place, portraying a mercenary/survivalist hired to kill the gopher plaguing the golf course. Although playing new characters in the sequel, Jackie Mason, [[Robert Stack]], Dan Aykroyd, and [[Jonathan Silverman]] play roles that are analogous to those played by Dangerfield, Knight, Murray, and [[Michael O'Keefe]] in the first film. [[Sam Kinison]], who had appeared alongside Dangerfield in ''Back to School'', was originally intended for [[Randy Quaid]]'s role, but left the production when Dangerfield dropped out.\n\n''Caddyshack II'' began filming on January 18, 1988, at the Rolling Hills Country Club in [[Davie, Florida]] (where ''Caddyshack'' had been filmed just under a decade prior). Despite working on the set with a [[golf pro]], Mason could not make a convincing [[golf swing]]; he also couldn\u2019t remember his lines, had no chemistry with this onscreen love interest (played by [[Dyan Cannon]]) and his gorging at the [[craft services]] table meant the wardrobe department had to keep letting out his pants. Aykroyd angered the producers by insisting on playing his role with a high-pitched, whinnying voice (which Aykroyd claimed was based on the voice of Colonel [[Oliver North]]).<ref name=\"SI\" />\n\nArkush also had problems working with Chevy Chase, who was paid a substantial fee for a relatively minimal role. Arkush later recalled, \"It was a big paycheck, which Chevy talked about a lot... I went into this thinking that Chevy was committed to this character, but he wasn\u2019t. On his first day, we were working out the blocking for his scene and I said, \u2018How do you want to do this, Chevy?\u2019 And he was just pissed at me and said, \u2018Why? Don\u2019t you have any ideas?!\u2019\u201d<ref name=\"SI\" /> Arkush claimed that two days later, when filming Chase, Arkush offered suggestions to which Chase snapped, \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t I get any input on this?!\u201d Later, while watching one of his scenes during postproduction, Chase quipped to Arkush, \u201cCall me when you\u2019ve dubbed the laugh track,\u201d before walking off in disgust.<ref name=\"SI\" />\n\n[[Industrial Light and Magic]] supplied the visual effects for the scenes involving the [[animatronic]] [[gopher (animal)|gopher]]; vocal effects for the creature were provided by veteran voice-over artist [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Music==\nThe music score for ''Caddyshack II'' was provided by [[Ira Newborn]]. The film's theme song, \"[[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|Nobody's Fool]]\", was performed by [[Kenny Loggins]], who provided original songs (including the hit song \"[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]]\") for the first ''Caddyshack.'' Kenny Loggins had composed and recorded \"I'm Alright\" for the 1980 ''[[Caddyshack]]'' film, and was asked by film producer [[Jon Peters]] to write a theme song for the sequel.<ref name=\"newspaper\">{{cite news\n | title = Movies Definitely Light Up the Life of Kenny Loggins\n | last = Campbell\n | first = Mary\n | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=baceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Tc4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6748,2938704&dq\n | newspaper = Spartanburg Herald-Journal (via the [[Associated Press]])\n | date = August 23, 1988\n | page = C3\n | access-date = January 14, 2010}}</ref> \nInitially, according to Loggins, \"I wasn't so sure when he called about ''Caddyshack II''.

Not in a traditional way, mind you. This is a very bad picture, yet I was fascinated by its utter refusal to deviate from the formula. They theoretically could have gone a hundred different ways or told a brand new story about life at Bushwood, but they didn't. They doggedly held firm to the belief that by simply replicating as many elements from the original as closely as possible, they'd strike comedic gold a second time... My justification for liking ''Caddyshack II'' was that it's ultimately a movie about its own failed attempt at a franchise. It is an example of people desperately trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice. For me, that made some of the scenes humorous at the time. I didn't laugh because the comedy was of good quality...I laughed because the intention to duplicate the formula was so blatant that it became sublimely absurd... Any humor [''Caddyshack II''] contains comes not from the material but from the failed attempt at pulling the material off. I thought that, while it didn't work at the intended level, it did work on a whole other, unintended level.\n\nWatching it again 20 years later, I no longer find it to be amusing on ''any'' level... Ramis' original [''Caddyshack''] had, at its core, a number of personal anecdotes about life as a teenage caddy that made it more relatable. The sequel is just forced. It completely loses the anarchic spirit of the first one. It has slobs and snobs but not the underlying heart. The comedy is far too over-the-top, and the message about elitism is so overt that the comedy is suffocated...
