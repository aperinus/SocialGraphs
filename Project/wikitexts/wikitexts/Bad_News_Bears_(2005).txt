It is a remake of the 1976 sports film ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'', produced by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews and grossed just $34 million against its $35 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMorris Buttermaker is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the [[Seattle Mariners]] before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He is hired by Liz Whitewood to coach the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit afterwards, but Buttermaker dissuades them from quitting and promises to be a better coach.\n\nAmanda Wurlitzer, a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. Before the championship game Liz congratulates Buttermaker on his success, which leads to them sleeping together, which Toby, her son and a player on the team discovers by accident. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock orders his son Joey to intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and leaves the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8\u20137.\n\nAfter the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Morris Buttermaker\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Ray Bullock\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Liz Whitewood, Toby's mother\n* [[Ridge Canipe]] as Toby Whitewood\n* Brandon Craggs as Mike Engelberg\n* Jeffrey Davies as Kelly Leak\n* Timmy Deters as Tanner Boyle\n* Carlos Estrada as Miguel Agilar\n* Emmanuel Estrada as Jose Agilar\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Matthew Hooper\n* Kenneth \"K.C.\" Harris as Ahmad Abdul Rahim\n* Aman Johal as Prem Lahiri\n* [[Tyler Patrick Jones]] as Timmy Lupus\n* [[Sammi Kane Kraft]] as Amanda Wurlitzer\n* Jeffrey Tedmori as Garo Daragabrigadien\n* [[Arabella Holzbog]] as Shari Bullock, Ray's wife\n* [[Carter Jenkins]] as Joey Bullock, Ray & Shari's son\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''Bad News Bears'' opened on July 22, 2005 and ranked #5 at the North American domestic box office with $11,382,472.<ref>{{cite web |title= Weekend Box Office Results for July 22-24, 2005 |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2005&wknd=29&p=.htm |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher= [[Amazon.com]] |date= 2005-07-25 |access-date= 2013-05-06}}</ref> The film ultimately earned $32,868,349 in North America and $1,384,498 internationally for a worldwide total of $34,252,847, becoming a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|badnewsbears05|Bad News Bears}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n{{Anchor|Reception}}\n''Bad News Bears'' received mixed reviews from critics.
