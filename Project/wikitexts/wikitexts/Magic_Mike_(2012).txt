''Magic Mike'' was filmed in several locations around west central Florida. The film premiered as the closing film for the 2012 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on June 24, 2012, and was [[Wide release|widely released]] by [[Warner Bros.]] on June 29, 2012, and was a critical and commercial success.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Magic Mike XXL]]'' directed by [[Gregory Jacobs]],<ref name=\"Magic Mike XXL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2031946/Magic-Mike-XXL/full-credits.html|title=Magic Mike XXL|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref> was released on July 1, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nMike Lane has big plans for a business of his own but pays his bills through a series of odd jobs, most notably performing as the star stripper at Xquisite Strip Club in Tampa, a club owned by Dallas, who has dreams of creating an \"empire\" of strip clubs.\n\nMike soon meets 19-year-old Adam, a recent college dropout looking for a construction job. Mike takes Adam under his wing and encourages him to begin stripping at Xquisite. Mike is introduced to Adam's sister Brooke. Despite his on-and-off relationship with a woman named Joanna, Mike finds himself attracted to Brooke and promises to look after Adam.\n\nAdam falls further into the excessive lifestyle of the Xquisite dancers, using drugs and having sexual encounters with many clients. When Dallas announces he has a plan to move their act to [[Miami]], Mike confides in Brooke that he is tiring of the lifestyle and wants to get a small business loan to pursue his dream of opening a custom furniture business. The bank declines his loan application and Mike realizes that he has to stay in the business to continue to pay his bills. Mike later attends a [[hurricane party]] at Dallas' house, where Adam becomes part of a scheme created by Tobias, Xquisite's DJ, to sell drugs to Xquisite's clients, and is eventually given a package of ecstasy. Adam begins using drugs regularly, and Mike notices more of Adam's reckless behavior, to the chagrin of Brooke, who is relying on Mike to protect him.\n\nA few days later, Mike and Adam perform for a private party at a sorority house where Adam brings the package of drugs with him. At the party, Adam gives a young woman an ecstasy pill, causing a brawl between Adam and the woman's boyfriend. Mike and Adam are forced to flee without the drugs, which Adam says were worth $1,000. They also do not collect their payment, which infuriates Dallas. After the next night's show, Mike and Adam take drugs and go to a club. Adam vomits and passes out; Brooke finds him on Mike's floor the next morning. Brooke angrily confronts Mike about his lifestyle, and ends her friendship with him. Tobias and his suppliers break into Mike's house looking for Adam, revealing that the drugs were actually worth $10,000. Mike gives up most of his life savings to pay Adam's debt in full.\n\nLater, before the dancers' final performance at Xquisite, Mike decides he has had enough. Knowing that Dallas has no loyalty to any of them and is driven by greed, Mike leaves the club through the back. After realizing Mike is not coming back, Dallas promotes Adam to replace Mike as lead dancer. Mike drives to Brooke's apartment and tells her he has quit stripping. She has learned what he did for Adam, and she invites him to join her for breakfast. She playfully asks what they can do until morning, and then kisses him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Michael \"Magic Mike\" Lane,<ref name=\"joins\">{{cite web|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title=McConaughey joins Tatum in stripper pic|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118041403?refCatId=13l|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=August 26, 2012|date=August 16, 2011}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> a male stripper who performs at Xquisite.\n*[[Alex Pettyfer]] as Adam \"The Kid\",<ref name=\"joins\" /> Mike's protege who befriends him.\n*[[Cody Horn]] as Brooke,<ref name=\"likes\" /> Adam's sister and Mike's love interest\n*[[Olivia Munn]] as Joanna, Mike's on-again, off-again lover.\n*[[Matthew McConaughey]] as Dallas,<ref name=\"joins\" /> a former stripper who owns Xquisite and is Mike's boss.\n*[[Joe Manganiello]] as Big Dick Richie<ref name=\"olivia\">{{cite news | last=Fleming | first=Mike | url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/08/olivia-munn-joins-magic-mike/ | title=Olivia Munn Joins 'Magic Mike' | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=August 31, 2011 | access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Matt Bomer]] as Ken<ref name=\"likes\" /><ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite news | url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/08/matthew_bomer_magic_mike.html | title=Matthew Bomer Will Also Strip for Magic Mike | work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=August 17, 2011 | access-date=October 13, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Adam Rodriguez]] as Tito\n*[[Kevin Nash]] as Tarzan\n*[[Gabriel Iglesias]] as Tobias<ref name=\"bridesmaids\" />\n*[[Mircea Monroe]] as Mercedes\n*[[Camryn Grimes]] as Birthday Girl\n*[[Riley Keough]] as Nora<ref name=\"bridesmaids\">{{cite journal | last=Fernandez | first=Jay A. | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bridesmaids-actress-signs-magic-mike-231649 | title='Bridesmaids' Actress Signs on for 'Magic Mike' | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=September 6, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Tara<ref name=\"bridesmaids\" />\n*Michael Roark as Ryan\n*[[Betsy Brandt]] as Banker\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Magic Mike'' is directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]] based on a screenplay by [[Reid Carolin]], who is also one of the film's producers.
