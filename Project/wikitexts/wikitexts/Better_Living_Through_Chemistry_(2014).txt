She seduces the unhappy Doug and they begin an  affair during which they both use Doug's businesses to abuse drugs. Doug's life is transformed by \"[[better living through chemistry]]\". Elizabeth persuades Doug to murder her husband Jack ([[Ray Liotta]]) so that they can run away together by tampering with the dosages of his heart medication. The plan fails when the delivery boy steals the medication and overdoses. Doug realizes that he can't abandon his son who needs him and straightens up. Elizabeth leaves Jack and heads overseas.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Doug Varney<ref name=\"Sam\" />\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Elizabeth Roberts<ref name=\"Wilde\" />\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]]
