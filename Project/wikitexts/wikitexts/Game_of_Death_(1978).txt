Lee died during the making of the film. Over 100 minutes of footage was shot prior to his death,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sickels|first1=Robert C.|title=100 Entertainers Who Changed America: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture Luminaries [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of Pop Culture Luminaries|date=2013|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1598848311|pages=347|url=https://www.google.co.nz/books/edition/100_Entertainers_Who_Changed_America_An/kXCjAQAAQBAJ|access-date=May 16, 2022}}</ref> which was later misplaced in the [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] archives.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The remaining footage has since been released with Lee's original Cantonese and English dialogue, with John Little dubbing Lee's Hai Tien character as part of the documentary titled ''[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]]''. Much of the footage that was shot is from what was to be the climax of the film.\n\nDuring filming, Lee received an offer to star in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', the first [[kung fu film]] to be produced by a Hollywood studio ([[Warner Bros.]]), and with a budget unprecedented for the genre ($850,000). Lee died of [[cerebral edema]] before the film's release. At the time of his death, he had made plans to resume the filming of ''The Game of Death''. After Lee's death, ''Enter the Dragon'' director [[Robert Clouse]] was enlisted to finish the film using two stand-ins; it was released in 1978 as ''[[Game of Death#Game of Death (1978)|Game of Death]]'', five years after Lee's death, by Golden Harvest.\n\nThe story of Lee's original 1972 film involves Lee's character, in order to save his younger sister and brother, joining a group of [[martial artists]] who are hired to retrieve a stolen Chinese [[national treasure]]{{quote needed|date=June 2022}} from the top floor of a five-story [[pagoda]] in South Korea, with each floor guarded by martial artists who must be defeated while ascending the tower.<ref name=\"Polly\"/>{{additional citations needed|date=June 2022}} The 1978 film's plot was altered to a revenge story, where the [[mafia]] attempts to kill Lee's character, who fakes his death and seeks vengeance against those who tried to kill him. The final part of the film uses some of Lee's original film footage, but with the pagoda setting changed to a restaurant building, where he fights martial artists hired by the mafia in an attempt to rescue his fianc\u00e9e Ann Morris (played by [[Colleen Camp]]). This revised version received a mixed critical reception but was commercially successful, grossing an estimated {{US$|50,000,000|year=1978|round=-7}} worldwide.\n\nIt was an influential film that had a significant cultural impact. The original version's concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous [[action films]] and [[video games]]. The film is also known for Lee's iconic yellow-and-black jumpsuit as well as his fight scene with [[NBA]] player and student [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], both of which have been referenced in numerous media.\n\n== Original film ==\n=== Plot ===\nThe original plot involves Lee playing the role of Hai Tien (\u6d77\u5929), a retired champion martial artist who is confronted by Korean underworld gangs. They tell him the story of a pagoda where guns are prohibited, and under heavy guard by highly skilled martial artists who are protecting something ([[MacGuffin|which is not identified at all in any surviving material]]) held on its top level. The gang boss wants Hai to be a part of a group whose purpose is to retrieve said item. They would be the second group to try to do so, as the first attempt with a previous group had failed. When Hai refuses, his younger sister and brother are kidnapped, forcing him to participate. Hai, as well as four other martial artists (two of whom were played by [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] and [[Chieh Yuan]]), then fight their way up a five-level [[pagoda]], encountering a different challenge on each floor. The setting of the pagoda is at [[Beopjusa]] temple in [[Songnisan]] National Park in [[South Korea]].\n\nThe pagoda, called Palsang-jon, is the only remaining wooden pagoda in South Korea. At the base of the pagoda, they fight 10 people, all black belts in Karate. While inside the pagoda, they encounter a different opponent on each floor, each more challenging than the last. Although his allies try to help out, they are handily defeated, and Hai must face each of the martial artists in one-on-one combat. In the unfilmed portion of their mission, Lee's group were to defeat [[Korean people|Korean]] [[Hapkido]] master Hwang In-shik, playing a kicking master, then a Praying mantis style [[kung fu]] master, played by Taky Kimura. Lee then defeats [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Eskrima]] master [[Dan Inosanto]], [[Korean people|Korean]] [[Hapkido]] master [[Ji Han-jae]], and finally [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], who fights with a free and fluid style mirroring Lee's [[Jeet Kune Do]]. Because Abdul-Jabbar's character has great size and strength in addition to a fighting style as potent as Lee's, he can only be defeated once Hai recognises that an unusually [[Photosensitivity|high sensitivity to light]] is his greatest weakness.<ref>Little, John. Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey (book). McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-8092-9722-1}}</ref>\n\nImmediately after defeating the giant guardian, Hai turns around and descends the staircase, heading out of the pagoda. Despite all the talk of something awaiting up top of the (now unguarded) flight of stairs, there is no mention of anyone going up to retrieve it. No surviving material explains how this affects Hai or his captive siblings.<ref>[http://www.cityonfire.com/game-of-death-game-over/ ''Game Over!'' by Joe Kenney] Cityonfire.com January 1, 2011, JJ Bona</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nAlthough the pagoda was supposed to have five floors, complete scenes were only shot for three of the floors: the \"Temple of the Tiger\", where Lee faced Inosanto; the \"Temple of the Dragon\", where he fought Ji Han-jae; and the final floor, known as the \"Temple of the Unknown\", where he fought Abdul-Jabbar. Hapkido master [[Hwang In-shik]] was slated to play the guardian of the first floor, a master of a kick-oriented style, while Bruce's long-time student and good friend [[Taky Kimura]] was asked to play the guardian of the second floor, a stylist of praying mantis [[kung fu]].\n\nThe goal of the film's plot was to showcase Lee's beliefs regarding the principles of martial arts. As each martial artist is defeated (including Lee's allies), the flaws in their fighting style are revealed. Some, like Dan Inosanto's character, rely too much on fixed patterns of offensive and defensive techniques, while others lack [[Jeet Kune Do#Economy of motion|economy of motion]]. Lee defeats his opponents by having a fighting style that involves fluid movement, unpredictability, and an eclectic blend of techniques. His dialogue often includes comments on their weaknesses.\n\n=== ''Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey'' ===\nSeveral years later, Bruce Lee historian [[John Little (writer)|John Little]] released ''[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]]'', a documentary revealing the original footage and storyline of ''The Game of Death''. The documentary also includes a fairly in-depth biography of Lee and leads into the filming of ''The Game of Death''. Fans still believe there is more footage to be found. Originally meant to be a documentary in its own right, it can now be found on the second disc of the 2004 Special Edition DVD release of ''Enter the Dragon'', along with the documentary ''[[Bruce Lee: The Curse of the Dragon]]''.\n\n=== ''Bruce Lee in G.O.D: Shib\u014dteki Y\u016bgi'' ===\nIn 2000, the Japanese film ''[[w:ja:Bruce Lee in G.O.D \u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u904a\u622f|Bruce Lee in G.O.D \u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u904a\u622f]]'' was released on DVD. This film shows Lee's original vision of the film through the existing footage that was shot for the film before he died, interviews, and historical re-enactments of what went on behind the scenes. A \"special edition\" DVD was released in 2003.\n\n=== Cast ===\n==== Filmed cast ====\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as \"Hai Tien\" (also called \"the Yellow-Faced Tiger\")\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as \"Mantis, the 5th Floor Guardian\"\n* [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] as \"Mr. Tien, the Second Fighter\"\n* [[Chieh Yuan]] as \"Yuan, the Third Fighter\"\n* [[Dan Inosanto]] as \"Dan, the 3rd Floor Guardian\"\n* [[Ji Han-jae]] as \"Chi, the 4th Floor Guardian\"\n* [[Lee Kwan]] as \"Mr. Kuan the Locksmith\" (voice is heard at film's end)\n\n==== Unfilmed cast ====\n* [[Hwang In-shik]] as \"1st Floor Guardian\"\n* [[Taky Kimura]] as \"2nd Floor Guardian\"\n* [[Robert Wall]] as \"Mr. Wall, the American Fighter and Hai Tien's ally\"\n* [[George Lazenby]] as \"Hai Tien's master\"\n* [[Nora Miao]] as \"Hai Tien's sister\"\n* Uncast Child Actor as \"Hai Tien's brother\"\n* [[Carter Wong]] as \"Mr. Wong\"\n* [[Shih Kien]] as \"Crime Lord\"\n* [[Tony Liu]] as \"Huang\"\n* [[Wan Kam-leung]] as \"Lee Guo-hao, the Fifth Fighter\"\n* [[Betty Ting Pei]] as \"Hai Tien's wife\"\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as \"Black Belt Karate Leader - Ground Floor\"\n* [[Lam Ching-ying]], [[Yuen Wah]], [[Unicorn Chan]], Bee Chan, Wu Ngan, and 14 others as \"Black Belt Karate Fighters - Ground Floor\"\n* [[Han Ying-chieh]] as \"Thug 1\"\n* [[Yuen Biao]] as \"Thug 2\"\n* [[Alan Chui Chung-San]] as \"Thug 3\"\n* [[Corey Yuen]] as \"Thug 4\"\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as \"Fan who asks for Hai Tien's autograph\"\n\n==== Intended cast ====\n* [[Wong Shun-leung]] was originally approached to play the role of the [[Wing Chun]]-oriented 2nd Floor Guardian, but he declined, and was replaced by Taky Kimura.\n* Robert Baker, student of Lee's, was considered for the role eventually given to [[Robert Wall]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212735/http://www.thejkdbrotherhood.com/history-of-jkd/JKD-Brotherhood/JKD-Brotherhood/bob-baker-oakland-jkd.html\n\nRoy Cullen, the JKD Brotherhood</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|title=Black Belt Times|date=September 1972|newspaper=[[Black Belt Magazine]]|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|pages=12\u2013|access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Sammo Hung]] had been cast as the Third Fighter, but by the time Lee was ready to film with him, Hung had moved on to another project; Chieh Yuan took the part in his stead.\n\n== ''Game of Death'' (1978 film) ==\n{{Chinese|title=Game of Death (1978)|t=\u6b7b\u4ea1\u904a\u6232|s=\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6e38\u620f|ci={{IPA-yue|se\u032cim\u0254\u030f\u02d0\u014b j\u0250\u030fuh\u0113i}}|mi={{IPAc-cmn|si|3|wang|2|-|you|2|x|i|4}}|p= S\u01d0w\u00e1ng Y\u00f3ux\u00ec |j= Sei5 Mong4 Jau4 Hei3}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Game of Death\n| native_name      = {{Film name\n| traditional = {{lang|zh-Hant|\u6b7b\u4ea1\u904a\u6232}}\n| simplified  = {{lang|zh-Hans|\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6e38\u620f}}}}\n| image          = Gameofdeath.JPG\n| alt            = \n| caption        = ''Game of Death'' film poster\n| director       = [[Robert Clouse]]<br />[[Bruce Lee]] <small>(G.O.D. footage)<br /> (action)</small><br />[[Sammo Hung]] <small>(action)</small>\n| producer       = [[Raymond Chow]]\n| writer         = Jan Spears {{small|(Clouse/Chow)}}<br />Bruce Lee <small>(HK Version Opening Credit)</small>\n| starring       = [[Bruce Lee]]<br />[[Gig Young]]<br />[[Dean Jagger]]<br />[[Colleen Camp]]<br />[[Kim Tai-chung|Kim Tai-jong]]<br />[[Yuen Biao]]<br />[[Robert Wall]]<br />[[Hugh O'Brian]]<br />[[Dan Inosanto]]<br />[[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]<br />[[Mel Novak]]<br />[[Sammo Hung]]<br />[[Ji Han-jae]]<br />[[Casanova Wong]]\n| music          = [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]<br />[[Joseph Koo]]\n| cinematography = Ho Lan-shan<br />Godfrey A.

The film stars [[Bruce Lee]], with [[Kim Tai-chung|Kim Tai-jong]] and [[Yuen Biao]] as his stunt doubles, along with [[Gig Young]], [[Dean Jagger]], [[Colleen Camp]], [[Robert Wall]], [[Hugh O'Brian]], [[Dan Inosanto]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Mel Novak]], [[Sammo Hung]], [[Ji Han-jae]] and [[Casanova Wong]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nThe 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot involving a new character, Billy Lo (\u76e7\u6bd4\u5229), struggling against a [[racketeering]] \"syndicate\" after gaining international success as a martial arts movie star. When Billy refuses to be intimidated by syndicate henchman Steiner ([[Hugh O'Brian]]) and his gangs of thugs, syndicate owner Dr. Land ([[Dean Jagger]]) orders his assassination to serve as an example to others.\n\nDisguised as a stuntman, Land's assassin, Stick ([[Mel Novak]]), sneaks onto the set of Billy's new film, and shoots Billy during filming. A fragment of the bullet passes through Billy's face, leaving him alive but in need of plastic surgery which alters his facial features. Billy takes the opportunity to fake his death and disguise himself, exacting revenge against those who wronged him one at a time. When the syndicate threatens and kidnaps his fianc\u00e9e, Ann Morris ([[Colleen Camp]]), Billy is forced to come out of hiding to save her. In the revised film, Bruce Lee's fight scenes inside the pagoda are assumed to take place in the upper floors of the Red Pepper restaurant, where Dr. Land and his thugs have laid an ambush. In the end, Billy survives the ambush, rescues Ann, and destroys each of the main mobsters one-by-one.\n\n=== Cast ===\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as \"Billy Lo\" (archive footage from incomplete first version)\n** [[Kim Tai-chung|Kim Tai-jong]] as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee)\n** [[Yuen Biao]] as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee in acrobatics)\n** Albert Sham as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee)\n** Chris Kent as the English voice of \"Billy Lo\" (dubbing for Bruce Lee)\n** Bruce Lee's actual battle cries are used in the Cantonese and Mandarin versions instead of Chris Kent's battle cry voice.\n* [[Gig Young]] as \"Jim Marshall\"\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as \"Dr. Land\"\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as \"Ann Morris\"\n* [[Hugh O'Brian]] as \"Steiner\"\n* [[Robert Wall]] as \"Carl Miller\"\n* [[Dan Inosanto]] as \"Pasqual\"\n* [[Ji Han-jae]] as \"Restaurant Fighter\"\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as \"Hakim\"\n* [[Mel Novak]] as \"Stick\"\n* [[Sammo Hung]] as \"Lo Chen\"\n* [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] as \"Charlie Wang\" (US version) / \"Fong Chun\" (HK version)\n* [[Roy Chiao]] as \"(Uncle) Henry Lo\" (US version only)\n* [[Casanova Wong]] as \"Lau Yea-chun\" (HK version only)\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as \"Fighter in Film\" (archive footage)\n* [[Alan Chui Chung-San]] (Assistant stunt double, also One of Dr. Land's Guard)\n* Tony Leung\n* Billy McGill\n* Jim James\n* Russell Cawthorne\n* [[Lam Ching-ying]]\n* John Ladalski\n* David Hu\n* Don Barry\n* Jess Hardie\n* Eddie Dye\n* Peter Nelson\n* Peter Gee\n* Peter Chan\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] as one of Dr. Land's guards (extra)\n* [[Lau Kar-wing]]\n* [[Fung Hak-On]] as Thug Wearing The Yellow Suit Fighting in Henry Lo's Opera Place (US version only)\n* Tai San\n* Jason Williams\n\n=== Production ===\nThe revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original ''The Game of Death'', and for the vast majority of the film, the role of Billy Lo was shared by Korean [[taekwondo]] master [[Kim Tai-chung|Kim Tai-jong]] and Hong Kong martial arts actor [[Yuen Biao]], and was voiced by Chris Kent. The plot of the film allowed Kim and Yuen to spend much of the film in disguises, usually involving false beards and large, dark sunglasses that obscured the fact that they bore little resemblance to Lee. Many scenes, including fight scenes, also included brief close-up bits of stock footage of the real Bruce Lee from his pre-''Enter the Dragon'' films, often only lasting a second or two. These clips are easily recognisable due to the difference in film quality between the old and new footage. At one point in the movie, real footage of Lee's corpse in his open-topped casket is used to show the character Billy Lo faking his death. There is even a scene, taken place in Billy's dressing room, where a cut-out of Lee's face was taped to a mirror, covering the stand-in's own face.\n\nSeveral actors associated with previous Lee movies were included in the re-shoot for the final 1978 film. For example, [[Robert Wall]], a villain in both ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''Enter the Dragon'', plays a kickboxer named Carl Miller who must battle with Billy Lo. [[Sammo Hung]], who appeared in ''Enter the Dragon'', served as the fight coordinator for the film, and also appears in the scene as ring opponent Lo Chen for Miller. To maintain continuity with the fight footage taken from the original film, Dan Inosanto (renamed Pasqual) and Ji Han-jae (whose character was unnamed and was not shown until near the end of the film) were given small parts as additional enforcers for the syndicate. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar refused to participate in the re-shoot, with another tall African-American stand-in (renamed Hakim) included instead. Although [[Chuck Norris]] is credited as starring in the film, his role is limited to clips from ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' inserted into the film.\n\nThe film quality of the Clouse-directed footage is noticeably higher than that of Lee's earlier Hong Kong films, and [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] provided an original soundtrack. The film also featured performances by experienced actors as well as up-and-coming stars, including two recipients of the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] (Dean Jagger and Gig Young) and several who have been honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], including Bruce Lee, Dean Jagger, Chuck Norris, Hugh O'Brian, and Gig Young (in his final film).\n\nFor Chinese-speaking audiences, the film was dubbed into Cantonese and Mandarin, and had significant changes, such as the inclusion of a fight in a greenhouse with [[Casanova Wong]] and a different opening and closing credits sequence, featuring a new theme song, plus a couple of minor scenes. Unlike the English version, these versions use Lee's actual battle sounds. Several scenes were removed as well, including the fight in the opera house dressing room.\n\nIn the original Hong Kong version, the fight with Ji Han-jae is included (although it occurs in the middle of the film), while the ending does not show Billy Lo being arrested. Instead, both he and Ann share their good-byes to Jim as they appear to depart Hong Kong on a boat. The Singaporean version ends with Billy's arrest, and it does not feature the Ji Han-jae fight. This is the version commonly found in Chinese.\n\nThe Mandarin-dubbed version of the film features a different theme song from that of the Cantonese version. The theme song sounds similar to the main theme of ''[[Way of the Dragon]]''. This version also includes the scene where Billy and Ann share their good-byes to Jim. The Cantonese-dubbed version shows the commonly found scene where Billy is arrested by the police.\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe American score was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]. The vocal theme song \"Will This Be The Song I'll Be Singing Tomorrow?\" was sung by [[Colleen Camp]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John Barry - Game of Death |url=https://www.discogs.com/John-Barry-Game-of-Death/release/10458213 |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Theme song ====\n; \"Game of Death\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u6b7b\u4ea1\u904a\u6232}})\n:* Lyrics: [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]]\n:* Composition and Arrangement: [[Joseph Koo]]\n:* Performance: [[Roman Tam]]\n\n=== Release ===\n''Game of Death'' was released in Hong Kong on 23 March 1978.

In order for the henchmen to remain low key, they should be wearing more casual clothes instead of the multicolored tracksuits seen at various parts of the film. But as a rationale, this explains why Lee wears the yellow tracksuit. Also, during the fight between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the scene near the vase in Logan's opinion appears to look choppy, along with the short fight with Hugh O'Brian. In the first half of the English version, during the fight sequences, Lee is seen to be beaten down instead of making short work of the henchmen.\n\n''Game of Death'' could be considered more accessible to Western audiences than Lee's previous films. Compared to other Bruce Lee films like ''[[The Big Boss]]'', ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' and ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''Game of Death'' has more Western characters and the story structure is more straightforward and less culturally specific to Asia.<ref name=\"GameofDeath\">{{cite video | title = ''Game of Death'', Bey Logan audio commentary disc one (DVD featurette) | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Hong Kong Legends]], UK |date = 2001}}</ref><ref>Graeme Clark, [http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=2051 Game of Death review], ''The Spinning Image''</ref>\n\n== ''Game of Death Redux'' (2019) ==\nOn July 19, 2019, timed with the 46th death anniversary of Bruce Lee, producer Alan Canvan premiered a newly edited version of Lee's ''Game of Death'' at the Asian American/Asian Research Institute in [[New York City]], with biographer [[Matthew Polly]] joining Canvan in discussing the film and answering audience questions.<ref name=\"AAARI\">{{cite web|author1=Canvan, Alan |author2=Polly, Matthew|title=Bamboo, Nunchucks & Dirty Footprints: A Retrospective of Bruce Lee's 'Game of Death' |url=https://aaari.info/19-07-19canvan/|website=Asian American / Asian Research Institute|date=19 July 2019|access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> The ''Redux'' edit only uses footage shot during the original production, while combining the score composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] for the 1978 version.<ref name=\"AAARI\"/> It also restores dialogues that were missing in the 1978 version of ''Game of Death''.<ref>{{cite web|last=C|first=Alan|title=Bamboo, Nunchucks & Dirty Footprints|url=https://www.36styles.com/kungfufandom/index.php?/topic/25013-bamboo-nunchucks-dirty-footprints/|website=Kung Fu Fandom|access-date=14 April 2020|page=1|date=12 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released as a special feature in [[The Criterion Collection]]'s Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bruce Lee: His Greatest Hits|url=https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/3205-bruce-lee-his-greatest-hits|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|publisher=The Criterion Collection|access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Other ''Game of Death'' films ===\nAfter the death of Bruce Lee, several studios exploited the situation by making their own versions of ''Game of Death'' based on what they had learned of the story from production stills and magazine articles. Some of these films pre-dated Robert Clouse's official ''Game of Death'' (1978).\n* ''[[Goodbye Bruce Lee: His Last Game of Death]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Enter the Game of Death]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The True Game of Death]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Game of Death II]]'' (''Tower of Death'') (1981)\n: Clouse's film had a sequel in 1981, ''Game of Death II'', a kung fu action mystery film directed by [[Ng See-yuen]] which used cut footage from Lee's ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' to have him make an appearance in the beginning of the film, only to be killed off midway, allowing his on-screen brother to take on the role of protagonist. Aside from the international English dub giving the \"Bruce Lee\" character the name [[Billy Lo]], this movie appears to have no connection with Clouse's film.\n\nWong Jing's film ''[[City Hunter (film)|City Hunter]]'' has a similar premise for a scene. [[Jackie Chan]] as Ryu Saeba takes on two tall black men, and the film uses clips of Lee's fight scene against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to get the better of the two.\n\n=== Influence ===\nThe original film's concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous [[action films]] and [[video games]].<ref name=\"Polly\">{{cite book |last1=Polly |first1=Matthew |title=Bruce Lee: A Life |date=4 June 2019 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=978-1-5011-8763-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bGWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA381}}</ref>\n\n==== Film ====\nItalian film scholars Simone Bedetti and Lorenzo De Luca identified ''Game of Death'' as an early example of what they call the \"arcade movie\" genre of [[action films]]. These \"arcade movies\" have three characteristic elements: the achievement of a ''goal'', passing a series of ''levels'', and ascending through a ''path'' (whether physical or symbolic). This is presented in ''Game of Death'' as Lee going up higher floors while facing increasingly dangerous opponents as he ascends the tower. Later examples of action films which Bedetti and De Luca identify as \"arcade movies\" include Bruce Lee's own ''Enter the Dragon'', the [[Bruce Willis]] movie ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1995), and the [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] movie ''[[Sudden Death (1995 film)|Sudden Death]]'' (1995).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bedetti |first1=Simone |last2=Luca |first2=Lorenzo De |title=Il cinema secondo Van Damme: l'evoluzione del cinema d'azione da Bruce Lee a Bruce Willis |trans-title=Cinema according to Van Damme: the evolution of action cinema from Bruce Lee to Bruce Willis |date=2000 |publisher=[[Castelvecchi]] |isbn=978-88-8210-185-5 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSGNMOlAzo8C&pg=PA71 |language=it |quote=Van Damme si era cimentato nei filoni pi\u00f9 in voga del ''techno action'', adattandosi alle nuove esigenze di Hollywood \u2013 con l'apparente complicit\u00e0 dei producttori \u2013 e allontanandosi dai personaggi che gli avevano regalato la fama per aderire al nuovo corso hollywoodiano e seguire il genere nel \u00abdefinitivo\u00bb, filone dell{{'}}''arcade movie''.

In the Clouse-directed remake, the filmmakers rationalised its presence by including a scene where Billy Lo disguises himself as one of Dr. Land's motorcycle-riding thugs, who all wear striped jumpsuits.\n\nIn the warehouse scene, Billy Lo wears a pair of yellow Adidas shoes with black stripes and white shelltoes. Towards the end of the film, Billy wears a pair of yellow [[Onitsuka Tiger]] shoes, with black stripes. This is because the real Bruce Lee wore the latter when he was filming, and the double wore the former in the 1978 version to resemble his shoes.\n\nIn the Lee-directed unfinished version, the jumpsuit should portray personal freedom in the art of combat, without being bounded to a certain fighting style. The cinematic explanation for its presence was the nickname of Hai Tien, Yellow-Faced [[Tiger]], because his fighting outfit and shoes resemble the colours of a Tiger. Over the years there were many speculations about the colour of the jumpsuit and its meaning. According to [[Andre Morgan]] from Golden Harvest, they had a yellow suit with black bars, and a black suit with yellow bars. Lee first chose the black suit, but changed it to the yellow because Abdul-Jabbar's footprints were better visible on it.\n\n==== Film ====\n* [[Uma Thurman]] wears a similar suit in ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'' when she travels to Japan to take on an underworld boss and assassin played by [[Lucy Liu]]. In homage to both the film and the remake, Thurman wears a two-piece suit and the Onitsuka Tiger sneakers as part of her motorcycle-riding gear, and keeps the suit on during her battle with Liu and her gang, the Crazy 88.\n* In ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', a similar suit is worn by the goalie \"Empty Hand\" ([[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]]), who resembles Lee.\n* In the [[Jet Li]] film ''[[High Risk (1995 film)|High Risk]]'', [[Jacky Cheung]] plays an [[action film]] star who is losing his fighting ability due to his cowardice and drunkenness. When he regains his courage at the end of the film, he wears a copy of the yellow tracksuit. The role is generally felt to be a parody of [[Jackie Chan]], but the references to Bruce Lee are also obvious.\n* The 1985 film ''[[The Last Dragon]]'', produced by [[Motown]] founder [[Berry Gordy]], centred around a Bruce Lee fan, portrayed by [[Taimak]], in search of reaching martial arts enlightenment who instructed his students wearing the same tracksuit.\n* In ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'', [[Brian Tochi]]'s character, Toshiro Takashi, wears the yellow jumpsuit while riding a tricycle during the inter-Greek competitions.\n* In the [[Wong Jing]] live-action ''[[City Hunter]]'' film, [[Jackie Chan]] uses the scene with Lee fighting Abdul-Jabbar as a reference to dispatch his own taller opponents.\n* In ''[[Police Story 4: First Strike]]'', [[Jackie Chan]] wears a similar suit that he gets from a wardrobe of an hotel room, claiming that he is a dry cleaner to the owner, with the same colors and the left and right black line.\n* In ''[[Finishing the Game]]'', Breeze Loo, played by [[Roger Fan]], wears a yellow and black striped jumpsuit.\n* In the 2011 [[British comedy]] film ''[[On the Ropes (2011 film)|On the Ropes]]'', writer and director [[Mark Noyce]] added a scene in homage to his idol [[Bruce Lee]] which featured Mick Western (played by [[Ben Shockley]]) wearing a yellow tracksuit.\n\n==== Music ====\n* A short promotional video for the virtual band, [[Gorillaz]], showed the fictional animated guitarist, Noodle, taking on a pack of thugs while dressed in the tracksuit and imitating Lee's fighting style. Noodle also wore the suit in the ''Game of Death'' short clip from ''[[Phase One: Celebrity Take Down]]''.\n* The band, [[Sugar Ray]], in their video for the single \"[[When It's Over (Sugar Ray song)|When It's Over]]\", included a segment in which one of its band members ([[Rodney Sheppard]], [[Guitarist]]) fantasizes about having a kung fu battle similar to the fight scene between Lee and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. The band member wears Lee's tracksuit, his opponent wears a beard, clothes, and sunglasses similar to Abdul-Jabbar's, and the video duplicates the scene in which a seated Kareem kicks Lee in the chest, knocking him down and leaving a huge footprint on his chest.\n* [[Topper Headon]] of [[The Clash]] was known to wear a similar jumpsuit at live shows; he is seen wearing in it the 1980 film [[Rude Boy (film)|Rude Boy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n*Avant-garde guitarist [[Buckethead]] released a cover of \"Game of Death\" in 2006.<ref>[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=56820 BUCKETHEAD Covers 'Game Of Death': Audio Available \u2013 21 August 2006]\n\nBlabbermouth.net</ref> He also wore a yellow tracksuit while playing live and performed with [[nunchaku]]s on stage.\n* American band, [[Far East Movement]]'s song, \"Satisfaction\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNCvu4ssIYg|title=Far East Movement-Satisfaction|website=[[YouTube]] }}{{cbignore}}{{Dead Youtube links|date=February 2022}}</ref> featured the yellow jumpsuits in its video, as the song was the soundtrack to the 2007 [[mockumentary]] ''[[Finishing the Game]]''.\n* Canadian hard rock duo [[Indian Handcrafts]]' song \"Bruce Lee\" uses the film as lyrical inspiration, while the music video features the two band members performing an over-the-top fight scene, with guitarist Daniel Brandon Allen wearing the signature yellow jumpsuit.\n* In the [[Iggy Azalea]]'s song [[Black Widow (Iggy Azalea song)|Black Widow]] featuring [[Rita Ora]] music video that is based on [[Kill Bill]], Azelea wears a ''white & black'' tracksuit and Ora wears a ''black & red'' tracksuit. Both suits resemble [[Uma Thurman]]'s version of the tracksuit.\n* In the video for Black Label Society's 2009 song \"Overlord\", frontman [[Zakk Wylde]] wears the iconic tracksuit, and the video pays humorous homage to the film.\n\n==== Manga and anime ====\n* In the ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'' episode titled \"The Mendo Family's Masquerade War\", Ataru was wearing a yellow tracksuit with black stripes while trying to court Mendou's sister who is sporting nunchakus. Both Ataru's yellow tracksuit and the Mendou sister's nunchakus are a homage to Bruce Lee.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://lum-chan.bbox.org/eps-guide/81-90.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20000516065505/http://lum-chan.bbox.org/eps-guide/81-90.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2000-05-16 | title=Episode 81-90}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.lum-chan.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=69c683315fecb1bc88ab48bd4e4592f0&topic=517.new#new | title=Redirecting: The World of Urusei Yatsura's Lum}}</ref>\n* In the anime/manga ''[[Tenjho Tenge]]'', there is a short appearance of a character named \"Inosato Dan\" who is the leader of the \"Jun Fan Gung Fu club\" (Jun Fan is Bruce Lee's Chinese name).
