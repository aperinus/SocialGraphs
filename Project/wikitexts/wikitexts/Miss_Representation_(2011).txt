The film premiered in the documentary category at the 2011 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=\"imo\" />\n\nApart from interviewing many powerful women in media, such as [[Jane Fonda]], [[Rachel Maddow]], and [[Katie Couric]], it also gives these women a chance to tell their story and why their personal experiences have made them so passionate about better portraying women in media. Newsom also uses this film to further her social action campaigns through The Representation Project that was started due to her frustration with how the under-representation of women in media is contributing to the under-representation of women in American politics. #RepresentHer is one of Newsom\u2019s campaigns that is a branch of the Representation Project, focusing on inequality in the workplace.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film interweaves stories from teenage girls with provocative interviews to give an inside look at the media and its message that underscores young women need and want positive [[role model]]s, and that the media has thus far neglected its unique opportunity to provide them. The film includes a social action campaign to address change in policy, education and call for socially responsible business.<ref name=\"lauzen\"/><ref name=\"rutgers\"/> The movie brought along a lot of positive movement and encourages those who viewed the film to take the pledge against gender misrepresentations by using hashtags like #RepresentHer and #DisruptTheNarrative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://therepresentationproject.org/the-movement/representher/|title=#RepresentHer - The Representation Project|newspaper=The Representation Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://therepresentationproject.org/the-movement/disruptthenarrative/|title=#DisruptTheNarrative - The Representation Project|newspaper=The Representation Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==Screenings==\nThe film previewed on October 18, 2010, at an awards luncheon hosted by the [[San Francisco]] [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]].<ref name=\"sfs\"/>  The film premiered on January 22, 2011 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], followed by screenings at the Athena Film Festival at [[Barnard College]] in [[New York City]] in February.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast consists of over 109  subjects, appearing as themselves.
