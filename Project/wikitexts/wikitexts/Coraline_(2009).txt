The film tells the story of its titular character discovering an idealized parallel universe behind a secret door in her new home, unaware that it contains a dark and sinister secret.\n\nJust as Gaiman was finishing the novel of the same name, Selick met Gaiman where he invited him to make a film adaptation, as Gaiman was a fan of Selick's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. When Selick thought that a direct adaptation would lead to \"maybe a 47-minute movie\", the screenplay had some expansions, like the introduction of Wybie, who was not present in the original novel. In February 2006, Selick was hired to direct ''Coraline'' when he left ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]''. To capture [[stereoscopy]] for the 3D release, the animators shot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions.

The film won [[Annie Award]]s for [[Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production|Best Music in an Animated Feature Production]], Best Character Design in an Animated Feature Production and Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, and received nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nCoraline Jones struggles to adapt to her new life after she and her [[workaholic]] parents move from [[Pontiac, Michigan]] to the Pink Palace Apartments in [[Ashland, Oregon]]. She meets the landlady's grandson, Wyborne \"Wybie\" Lovat, and a stray [[black cat]]. Later, Wybie gives her a button-eyed ragdoll from his grandmother's trunk that eerily resembles Coraline. The doll guides Coraline to a small door in her apartment with a bricked up wall behind it.\n\nThat night, a [[mouse]] leads Coraline back to the door, now a portal leading to a [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]], where Coraline meets her Other Mother and Father, button-eyed doppelg\u00e4ngers of her parents who appear more attentive and caring. She returns home the next morning, where Wybie recounts the disappearance of his great-aunt. Coraline's neighbors Sergei Alexander Bobinsky, an eccentric [[Chernobyl liquidator]]-turned-gymnast who owns a mouse circus, and retired [[burlesque]] actresses April Spink and Miriam Forcible cryptically warn her about imminent danger.\n\nDespite the warnings, Coraline visits the Other World twice more. Accompanied by the mute Other Wybie, she is entertained by the dimension's doppelg\u00e4ngers of her neighbors and meets the cat, who can traverse between the two worlds and [[Talking animals in fiction|speaks]] in the Other World. On Coraline's third visit, the Other Mother offers to let her stay in the Other World permanently, in exchange for having buttons sewn over her eyes. Horrified, Coraline tries to escape back to her world, but the Other Mother imprisons her in a room behind a mirror.\n\nThere, the ghosts of past victims, including Wybie's great-aunt, tell Coraline how the Other Mother, whom they call the Beldam, used ragdolls of themselves to spy and lure them to the Other World. After accepting the Beldam's offer to sew buttons over their eyes, she robbed them of their souls. The ghosts explain that they can only be freed by retrieving the essences of their souls, which the Beldam has hidden throughout the Other World. Coraline promises to do so, and is rescued by the Other Wybie, who helps her return home.\n\nCoraline realizes the Beldam has kidnapped her parents, forcing her to return to the Other World. Accompanied by the cat, Coraline proposes a game: if she can find her parents and the essences of the ghosts' souls, they will all go free; if not, she will finally accept the Beldam's offer. The Beldam agrees and Coraline searches for the souls' essences, discovering that the Beldam murdered the Other Wybie for his defiance. As she finds each essence, parts of the Other World turn lifeless as the entire dimension eventually disintegrates.\n\nCoraline encounters the Beldam in her true [[arachnid]]-like form, and the ghost of Wybie's great-aunt warns that the Beldam will not honor her bargain. Tricking the Beldam into opening the door to the real world by claiming that her parents are behind it, Coraline throws the cat at her and rescues her parents, who are trapped in a [[snow globe]]. Coraline narrowly escapes through the door, severing the Beldam's right hand.\n\nBack home, Coraline reunites with her parents, who have forgotten about their capture. That night, the ghosts appear in Coraline's dream and thank her for freeing them, but warn that the Beldam is still after the key needed to unlock the door. Coraline decides to drop the key down an old well, but the Beldam's severed hand attacks her. Wybie arrives and, after a struggle, destroys the hand with a large rock. The duo toss the key and the hand's remnants into the well and seal it. The next day, Coraline and her parents host a party for their neighbors, including Wybie's grandmother, whom Coraline and Wybie prepare to tell about her missing sister's fate.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Coraline Jones\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Melanie \"Mel\" Jones and The Beldam (also known as The Other Mother)\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as April Spink and her Other World counterpart\n* [[Dawn French]] as Miriam Forcible and her Other World counterpart\n* [[John Hodgman]] as Charlie Jones and The Other Father\n** [[John Linnell]] provides the Other Father's singing voice\n* [[Robert Bailey Jr.]] as Wyborne \"Wybie\" Lovat\n* [[Keith David]] as The Cat\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Sergei Alexander Bobinsky and his Other World counterpart\n* [[Caroline Crawford|Carolyn Crawford]] as Mrs. Lovat\n* Aankha Neal, George Selick, and Hannah Kaiser as the Ghost Children\n* Marina Budovsky and Harry Selick as Coraline's friends back in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]\n\n==Production==\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"''Coraline'' [was] a huge risk.
