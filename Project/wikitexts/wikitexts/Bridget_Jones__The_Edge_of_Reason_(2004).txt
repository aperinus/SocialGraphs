It stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Bridget Jones]], [[Colin Firth]] as Mark Darcy, and [[Hugh Grant]] as Daniel Cleaver. It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (2001). The film was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2004 and a week later in the United States, to mixed reviews from film critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing over $260 million worldwide. Zellweger received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for her performance. A third film, ''[[Bridget Jones's Baby]]'', was released in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Bridget Jones]] ([[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]) is ecstatic about her new relationship with Mark Darcy ([[Colin Firth]]). However, Bridget's confidence is shattered when she meets Mark's assistant, the beautiful, slim, quick-witted Rebecca Gillies ([[Jacinda Barrett]]).\n\nAt her job on the TV morning show ''Sit-Up Britain,'' Bridget crosses paths with her ex, Daniel Cleaver ([[Hugh Grant]]), and is offered a position alongside him in a new travel series. Initially refusing, she declares Daniel is a \"deceitful, sexist, disgusting specimen of humanity,\" but eventually signs on, despite her friends' misgivings.\n\nBridget is delighted when Mark invites her to his \"Law Council Dinner,\" believing he will propose afterward. However, a series of mishaps make the evening a debacle, culminating in the team trivia quiz: Bridget makes a critical error on a question about [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], which Rebecca Gillies wins, leaving Bridget thoroughly deflated.\n\nAfter the dinner, Mark and Bridget argue and she stomps off. He goes to her apartment, apologizes, and tells her he loves her for the first time. Later that night, he invites her on a ski holiday to [[Lech (Vorarlberg)|Lech]], Austria. On the slopes, Bridget learns Rebecca is also there with a few other colleagues. She has a pregnancy scare, but after an argument over the upbringing and education of their hypothetical future children, the pregnancy test proves negative. Returning home, Bridget and Mark attend a lunch with their parents, where Bridget is hurt by Mark's dismissal of their prospective marriage.\n\nOverhearing a message from Rebecca on Mark's answering machine, Bridget dissects it with her friends, who advise her to confront him; she does, he refuses \"to dignify the question with an answer,\" and she breaks up with him. She travels to [[Thailand]] with Shazza ([[Sally Phillips]]) and Daniel Cleaver to film \"The Smooth Guide.\" She and Daniel visit several exotic locations and, after Bridget accidentally consumes [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, they flirtily reconnect, but her trust in him again dissipates when a Thai [[prostitute]] he ordered appears, and she sees he has not changed.\n\nShazza has a fling with the much younger Jed ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]), who gives her a fertility snake bowl as a gift to take back to Britain, which ends up in Bridget's bag. When security dogs at the airport detect a large stash of [[cocaine]] inside it, Bridget is arrested and locked up in a Thai prison cell with almost 50 Thai female inmates. Feeling low and scared but glad at the friendliness of the inmates, she shares relationship advice with the others and teaches them to sing and dance to Madonna's \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]].\"\n\nMark comes to tell Bridget that her release is imminent. After confirming Jed as the true perpetrator and that she \"spent the night\" with Daniel Cleaver, he declares her sex life does not interest him; Bridget does not correct his presumption, and he departs, leaving her sure he no longer loves her. Back in Britain, Mark confronts Daniel for abandoning Bridget in Thailand, and they fight outside an [[Serpentine Galleries|art gallery]] in [[Kensington Gardens]]. Daniel swears off her for good and says, \"Why don't you just marry her?\"\n\nBridget arrives at [[Heathrow Airport]] as an international human rights celebrity. Greeted by her parents, they have been busy planning their [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|vow renewal ceremony]]. At home, Bridget is surprised when her friends tell her that Mark personally tracked down the drug trafficker Jed, secured his custody and extradition, and forced him to admit her innocence. Hopeful that Mark still loves her, Bridget rushes to his house. Finding Rebecca there she assumes she is romantically involved with him, but Rebecca confesses she is actually crazy about Bridget and kisses her; though flattered, she politely turns her down.\n\nBridget confronts Mark at his legal chambers, asking him to give her another chance. He proposes and she accepts. At the film end, her parents renew their vows and Bridget catches the bouquet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as [[Bridget Jones]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Mark Darcy\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Daniel Cleaver\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Mrs. Pamela Jones\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Mr. Colin Jones\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Una Alconbury\n* [[James Faulkner (actor)|James Faulkner]] as Uncle Geoffrey\n* [[Jacinda Barrett]] as Rebecca Gillies\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Sharon \"Shazza\"\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Jude\n* [[James Callis]] as Tom\n* [[Neil Pearson]] as Richard Finch \n* [[Donald Douglas (Scottish actor)|Donald Douglas]] as Admiral Darcy\n* Shirley Dixon as Mrs. Darcy\n* [[David Verrey]] as Giles\n* [[Jeremy Paxman]] as Himself\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Quizmaster\n* [[Jessica Hynes|Jessica Stevenson]] as Magda\n* [[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]] (''special participation'') as Jed\n* [[Wolf Kahler]] as Commentator\n* [[Catherine Russell (British actress)|Catherine Russell]] as Camilla\n* [[Ting-Ting Hu]] as Thai prostitute\n* [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]] as Charlie Parker-Knowles\n* Vee Vimolmal as Phrao\n* [[Patrick Baladi]] as Flight attendant\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Taxi driver\n* [[Pui Fan Lee]] and Melissa Ashworth as Thai jail girls\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Lech am Arlberg 2006.jpg|thumb|The skiing scenes took place in [[Lech (Vorarlberg)]], western Austria]]\nPrincipal photography began on 6 October 2003 and concluded on 15 February 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFilming took place in [[Southwark]] and [[Primrose Hill]].<ref name=\"moviehiker.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviehiker.com/filmlocations/film/Bridget+Jones+The+Edge+of+Reason|title = Movie Hiker &#124; Bridget Jones the Edge of Reason Filming Locations and Sets}}</ref> The skiing scenes took place in [[Lech (Vorarlberg)]], western Austria.<ref name=\"moviehiker.com\"/><ref>{{cite web| url = https://vbgv1.orf.at/magazin/klickpunkt/stories/4773/index.html| title = Dreharbeiten in Lech fast abgeschlossen - Vorarlberg-Magazin}}</ref>\n\nDuring the fight scene between Daniel and Mark at the \"[[Serpentine Gallery]] in Kensington Gardens\" (actually filmed in the Italian Gardens near Lancaster Gate), it was for the most part not choreographed, instead, the actors were simply asked to fight each other any way they could.
