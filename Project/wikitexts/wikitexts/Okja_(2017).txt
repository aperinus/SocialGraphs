An international co-production of South Korea and the United States, it stars an [[ensemble cast]] headed by South Korean child actress [[Ahn Seo-hyun]], South Korean actors [[Byun Hee-bong]], [[Yoon Je-moon]], and [[Choi Woo-shik]], and [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] actors [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Steven Yeun]], [[Lily Collins]], [[Shirley Henderson]], [[Daniel Henshall]], [[Devon Bostick]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]].\n\nThe film competed for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' in the main competition section at the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Main\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/actualites/articles/the-2017-official-selection |title=The 2017 Official Selection |work=Cannes |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"IW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/cannes-2017-lineup-list-film-festival-schedule-1201804813/ |title=2017 Cannes Film Festival Announces Lineup: Todd Haynes, Sofia Coppola, 'Twin Peaks' and More |work=IndieWire |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref> It was released on [[Netflix]] on June 28, 2017. The film received positive reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2007, \"[[environmentalist]]\" Lucy Mirando becomes [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her twin sister. Announcing they have been breeding a special kind of \"super pig\", 26 specimens are sent to farmers around the world, and ten years later, one will be crowned the winner as the best pig.\n\nIn 2017, a young girl named Mija lives in [[South Korea]] with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. Mija and Okja have a very close relationship; they spend much of their time together, and at one point, Okja saves Mija from falling off a cliff. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig, and announces that they will take her to [[New York City|NYC]]. Her grandfather gives Mija a gold pig, explaining he saved up to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija goes to [[Seoul]] to find Okja, where she sees her being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF).\n\nIn the resulting chaos, Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. He asks another ALF member, K, to translate and tell Mija that they plan to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be recaptured by the Mirando Corporation to document how they mistreat animals. Mija asks them to return her to the mountains but K purposely mistranslates and tells them Mija agrees. They leave, and Okja is recaptured.\n\nTo minimize PR damage to the company, Lucy pays for Mija to come to NYC to reunite with her pig. Okja is taken to a laboratory where she is forcibly bred with another super pig and flesh is taken from her for a taste test. After the ALF sees the footage, K reveals that he lied to the rest of the group about Mija's support of the plan. Jay beats K, and expels him from the ALF.\n\nIn NYC, Mija has to comply with the Mirando Corp. Jay slips into her room and tells her they plan to rescue Okja while on stage. During the Mirando parade, a battered and temporarily blinded Okja attacks Mija. Jay tries to hurt Okja to protect the girl, but Mija doesn\u2019t let him and calms Okja down. The ALF shows Okja's mistreatment to the public, who quickly turn on Mirando. Lucy surrenders the company to her twin sister Nancy, who contacts a private security firm to take out ALF members. Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested, except for Mija and Jay, who are rescued by K. Nancy, Lucy\u2019s twin sister, reassumes the position of CEO and starts full-time operations at their slaughterhouse.\n\nK, Mija, and Jay travel to a processing plant in search of Okja, and find her at the processing plant, being forced up a ramp into a slaughterhouse. Mija shows a Mirando employee a photo of herself with baby Okja, prompting him to stop. Nancy arrives and Mija offers the gold pig in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees, having Jay and K arrested. As Mija and Okja are escorted away, a pair of super pigs push their newborn to Okja to hide it and take it away.\n\nBack in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Jay is released from prison, boarding a bus with K and the other members of the organization. With their newest member Kim Woo-shik, a former driver for Mirando Corporation, they plan to disrupt a major Mirando shareholders meeting.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ahn Seo-hyun]] as Mija, the protagonist, a young farm girl who takes care of and helped raise Okja.\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Lucy Mirando, the eccentric powerful CEO of the Mirando Corporation looking to profit from Okja and the super pig program.\n** Swinton also plays Nancy Mirando, Lucy's twin sister, the cruel former CEO of the Mirando Corporation\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Jay, the leader of an animal-rights activist group, the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF)\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Johnny Wilcox, a disturbed zoologist and TV personality\n* [[Byun Hee-bong]] as Hee Bong, Mija's grandfather\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as K, an animal-rights activist and ALF member who serves as translator between Mija and the rest of the ALF\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Frank Dawson, an executive with the Mirando Corporation\n* [[Lily Collins]] as Red, an animal-rights activist and ALF member\n* [[Yoon Je-moon]] as Mundo Park, a Korean representative of the Mirando Corporation\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Jennifer, Lucy's assistant\n* [[Daniel Henshall]] as Blond, an animal-rights activist, ALF member, and the boyfriend of Silver\n* [[Devon Bostick]] as Silver, an animal-rights activist, ALF member, and the boyfriend of Blond\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Woo-shik, a young driver for the Mirando Corporation\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Okja's voice / Wheelchair woman\n* [[Lee Bong-ryun]] as Mirando Korea desk clerk\n\n== Development and production ==\nIn October 2015, it was announced that director [[Bong Joon-ho]]'s next film would feature a South Korean female lead and a cast of English-speaking supporting actors, with filming set in New York.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Trumbore|first1=Dave|title='Okja': Bong Joon-ho's Monster Movie Adds Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Bill Nighy|url=https://collider.com/okja-jake-gyllenhaal-paul-dano-bill-nighy-kelly-macdonald/ |access-date=October 5, 2015|work=Collider|date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> On November 10, 2015, it was picked up by [[Netflix]] and [[Plan B Entertainment]] with a budget of $50 million, with production starting in late 2016 for release in 2017.<ref name=Budget>{{cite news|last1=Trumbore|first1=Dave|title=Netflix Backs Bong Joon-ho's 'Okja' with $50 Million|url=https://collider.com/okja-bong-joon-ho-netflix-brad-pitt-plan-b/ |access-date=November 10, 2015|work=Collider|date=November 10, 2015}}</ref> Darius Khondji joined the film as cinematographer in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asianmoviepulse.com/2016/02/bong-joon-ho-netflix-darius-khondji-join-forces-okja/|title=Bong Joon-ho, Netflix and Darius Khondji join forces for Okja|website=Asian Movie Pulse|language=en-US|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBong sought out Welsh author Jon Ronson to help with the script.
