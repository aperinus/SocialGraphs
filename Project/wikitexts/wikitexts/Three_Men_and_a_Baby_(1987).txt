It stars [[Tom Selleck]], [[Steve Guttenberg]], and [[Ted Danson]] as three [[bachelor]]s as they attempt to adapt their lives to de facto fatherhood with the arrival of the love child of one of the men. The script was based on the 1985 French film {{lang|fr|[[Trois hommes et un couffin]]|italic=yes}} (''Three Men and a Cradle'').\n\nThe film was the biggest American box office hit of that year, surpassing ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' and eventually grossing $167 million in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1987&p=.htm |title=1987 Yearly Box Office Results |publisher= Box Office Mojo}}</ref> and $240 million worldwide.<ref name=WW/> The film won the 1988 [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Comedy Motion Picture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect Peter Mitchell, satirist Michael Kellam, and actor Jack Holden are happy bachelors in their shared [[New York City|NYC]] apartment, with frequent parties and flings. One day, a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep with a note revealing she is the result of Jack\u2019s [[wikt:Special:Search/tryst|tryst]] with an actress named Sylvia during a [[Stratford Festival]] Shakespearean production a year prior.\n\nJack is in [[Turkey]] shooting a [[B movie|movie]], and makes arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment. Jack asks his roommates to keep the delivery a secret per his friend's wishes; when Mary arrives, they believe she is the \"package\".\n\nPeter and Michael are totally befuddled how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to buy supplies. Their landlady Mrs. Hathaway delivers a small box \u2013 the actual \"package\" of heroin \u2013 which Michael tosses aside. They learn to care for Mary, including [[diaper]] changes, baths, and feedings.\n\nFour days later, two drug dealers arrive at the apartment for the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give them Mary, along with a can of powdered milk the dealers believe is the heroin. Peter discovers the actual package; realizing the mix-up, he runs downstairs but trips, spilling the package's contents. He gathers up the drugs and confronts the men outside, causing a scuffle. A police officer on horseback intervenes; Peter rescues Mary, but the dealers flee with the can of powdered milk. The officer detains Peter and Michael at the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz, a narcotics officer, arrives to question them. Jack calls from Turkey, but Peter and Michael are unable to talk openly as they are being recorded. They successfully hide the drugs, learning that Jack's friend Paul Milner is a drug dealer. A suspicious Melkowitz puts them under surveillance.\n\nMrs. Hathaway babysits Mary while Peter and Michael go to work. Returning home, they find Mrs. Hathaway bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked by the dealers, but Mary safe; a note threatens, \"Next time we'll take the baby\". Peter and Michael continue to care for Mary, adjusting to 'fatherhood' and growing attached.\n\nPeter incapacitates an intruder, who turns out to be Jack, returning early after his movie role was cut. Jack assures Peter and Michael he knew nothing about the heroin. He initially denies his connection to Mary, but Sylvia\u2019s note convinces him he is Mary\u2019s father. Peter and Michael pass all parenting responsibility to Jack, who quickly grows to love her.\n\nThey receive a news clipping in the mail \u2013 Milner has been attacked by the drug dealers and hospitalized \u2013 with another threat: \"Don't let this happen to you!\" Peter, Michael, and Jack formulate a plan to trap the dealers, arranging a meeting. Jack, disguised as a pregnant woman, leaves the building with Mary, while Peter and Michael leave in a cab, followed by undercover officers, but manage to lose them in another cab driven by Jack. The three meet the dealers at the top floor of a construction site. Michael, hidden in the vents, records Peter\u2019s conversation with the dealers but falls into the room, and a chase ensues. They manage to trap the dealers in an elevator as the police arrive. With the recording, they prove their innocence to Melkowitz, and the dealers are arrested.\n\nPeter, Michael, and Jack fully embrace their role as Mary's guardians, until Sylvia arrives to take Mary with her to London. After she leaves with Mary, the three realize how desperately they miss the baby. Racing to the airport, they just miss Sylvia\u2019s plane for London. Defeated, they return home to find Sylvia and Mary at the door. Sylvia tearfully says she doesn't want to give up acting but must if she has to raise Mary alone. They invite her and Mary to move in; she accepts, and the four live happily with the baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Selleck]] as Peter Mitchell\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Michael Kellam\n* [[Ted Danson]] as Jack Holden\n* Lisa and Michelle Blair as Mary\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Rebecca\n* [[Celeste Holm]] as Mrs. Holden \n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Sylvia Bennington\n* Alexandra Amini as Patty\n* Peter Brown as Store Clerk\n* Francine Beers as Woman at Gift Shop\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Sgt.

As they do so, they pass a background window on the left-hand side of the screen, and a black outline that appears to resemble a rifle pointed downward can be seen behind the curtains. As they walk back past the window 40 seconds later, a human figure can be seen in that window. A persistent [[urban legend]] began circulating August 1990 (shortly before the sequel, ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', premiered) that this was the ghost of a boy who had been killed in the house where the film (or this scene) was filmed. The most common version of this myth was that a nine-year-old boy committed suicide with a shotgun there, explaining why it was vacant: because the grieving family left. This notion was discussed on the first episode of ''TV Land: Myths and Legends'' in January 2007, and was referenced in \"[[Hollywood Babylon (Supernatural)|Hollywood Babylon]]\", a second-season episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''.\n   \n[[File:DansonStandee.jpg|thumb|right|Danson's character standing next to a cardboard cutout of himself.]]\nThe figure is actually a cardboard cutout \"standee\" of Jack, wearing a [[tuxedo]] and [[top hat]], that was left on the set. It was created as part of the storyline, in which he, an actor, appears in a dog food commercial, but this portion was cut from the final version of the film. The standee does show up later in the film, when Jack stands next to it as Sylvia comes to reclaim Mary. [[Snopes.com]] contends that the one in the first scene looks smaller than it does in the later scene because of the distance and angle of the shot, and because the curtains obscure its outstretched arms. As for the contention that a boy died in the house, all the indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto sound stage, and no kind of residential dwellings were used for interior filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/3menbaby.asp |title=Does a Ghost Boy Appear in ''Three Men and a Baby''?|website=[[Snopes.com]]|first=David |last=Mikkelson|date=June 2, 1997 |access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/the-questions-that-will-not-die |title=The Questions That Will Not Die |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |via=rogerebert.com |date=March 6, 2008 |access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe critical response to ''Three Men and a Baby'' was generally positive.
