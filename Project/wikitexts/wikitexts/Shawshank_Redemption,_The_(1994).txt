It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne ([[Tim Robbins]]), who is [[Life imprisonment|sentenced to life]] in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding ([[Morgan Freeman]]), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the [[prison warden]] Samuel Norton ([[Bob Gunton]]). [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Gil Bellows]], and [[James Whitmore]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nDarabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce ''The Shawshank Redemption'', which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in [[Maine]], [[principal photography]] took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], with the [[Ohio State Reformatory]] serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tom Cruise]], and [[Kevin Costner]]. [[Thomas Newman]] provided the film's score.\n\nWhile ''The Shawshank Redemption'' received critical acclaim on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', the general unpopularity of [[prison film]]s, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.\n\nOver 320,000 [[VHS]] rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and [[word of mouth]], it became one of the top [[video rentals]] of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], and it was shown regularly on the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity.<!-- It cannot be said to be considered one of the greatest \"of all time\". [[WP:MOSFILM]] does not allow IMDb's Top 250 (or other similar Internet polls) to be used in determining the matter: it is not a poll of critics or scholars and is subject to vote stacking. --> Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most \"beloved\" films ever made. In 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- IMPORTANT: As WP:FILMPLOT requires, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. Count as of 10/30/17 is 692 words -->\nIn 1947, [[Portland, Maine]], banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to two [[Back-to-back life sentences|consecutive life sentences]] at the [[Shawshank State Prison]]. He is befriended by Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate and prison [[contraband]] smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures a [[Geologist's hammer|rock hammer]] and a large poster of [[Rita Hayworth]] for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently [[Prison rape|sexually assaulted]] by \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs Diamond.\n\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being [[Estate tax in the United States|taxed on an inheritance]] and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a [[Front organization|front]] to use Andy's financial expertise to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decrepit library.\n\nBrooks is [[parole]]d in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''; Andy plays [[Sull'aria ... che soave zeffiretto|an excerpt]] over the public address system and is punished with [[solitary confinement]]. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his time. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving [[Kickback (bribery)|bribes]]. Andy [[money laundering|launders]] the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".\n\nTommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his [[General Educational Development]] (GED) exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but Norton refuses to listen, and when Andy mentions the money laundering, Norton sends him back to solitary confinement. Norton has Hadley fatally shoot Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in [[Zihuatanejo]], a Mexican town on the Pacific coast. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near [[Buxton, Maine|Buxton]], asking Red\u2014once he is released\u2014to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for some rope.\n\nAt the next day's [[Roll call (policing)|roll call]], the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of [[Raquel Welch]] hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the past 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton's suit, shoes, and [[ledger]], containing evidence of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws over $370,000 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|370000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}) of the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\n\nThe following year, Red is finally paroled after serving 40 years. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to [[Zihuatanejo]]. Red violates his parole by traveling to [[Fort Hancock, Texas]], and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach in Zihuatanejo, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = [[Tim Robbins]] in 2012 (''left'') and [[Morgan Freeman]] in 2006\n | image1 = TimRobbinsTIFFSept2012.jpg\n | alt1 = A standing caucasian man with short white and grey hair, wears glasses and a blue coat: He faces left towards the camera smiling.\n | image2 = Morgan Freeman, 2006 (cropped).jpg\n | alt2 = An African American man with a beard and short hair, both a mix of white and grey, and wearing an earring in each ear: He is smiling towards the camera.\n  }}\n\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Andy Dufresne:<br/>A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover<ref name=\"PhilosophyNow14\"/>\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding:<br/>A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy<ref name=\"Cast\"/><ref name=\"RevEW\"/>\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Samuel Norton: <br/>The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary<ref name=\"PhilosophyNow14\"/>\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Heywood: <br/>A member of Red's gang of long-serving convicts<ref name=\"Cast\"/><ref name=\"Comingsoon\"/>\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Byron Hadley: <br/>The brutal captain of the prison guards<ref name=\"Gizmodo\"/><ref name=\"vanityfair\"/>\n* [[Gil Bellows]] as Tommy Williams: <br/>A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965<ref name=\"Cast\"/>{{Sfn|TSR|1993|loc=1h20m32s}}\n* [[James Whitmore]] as Brooks Hatlen: <br/>The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned since the early 1900s<ref name=\"Kennebeck\"/>\n\nThe cast also includes [[Mark Rolston]] as Bogs Diamond, the head of \"the Sisters\" gang and a prison rapist;<ref name=\"CastBogs\"/> [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne's trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con; [[Ned Bellamy]] and [[Don McManus]] as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig.<ref name=\"Cast\"/> Renee Blaine portrays Andy's wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin.<ref name=\"CastMJ\"/> Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy's fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley,<ref name=\"Cast\"/>{{Sfn|TSR|1993|loc=16m42s\u201419m05s}} and [[Bill Bolender]] plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted.<ref name=\"Cineworld\"/> James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/><ref name=\"Cleveland3\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe film has been interpreted as being grounded in [[Christian mysticism]].{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=14}} Andy is offered as a messianic, [[Christ]]-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=30}} The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the [[Last Supper]], with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the \"lords of all creation\" invoking Jesus' blessing.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=31, 39}} Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention,{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=31}} but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film.<ref name=\"Empire1\"/> The discovery of ''The Marriage of Figaro'' record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the [[Holy Grail]], bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=39}}\n\nEarly in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, \"I am the light of the world\", declaring himself Andy's savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=48}} Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan.<ref name=\"PhilosophyNow14\"/> The warden has also been compared to former United States President [[Richard Nixon]]. Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=45}}\n\n[[File:Sand dunes at Shallow Inlet, Sandy Point - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An empty crescent shaped beach, with small patches of grass and a small red boat sits on the shore. The sea appears to the left of the image and mountains appear in the background.|Andy and Red's reunion was filmed at the [[Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge]], Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The location has been interpreted as a form of escape or paradise.]]\nZihuatanejo has been interpreted as an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] for heaven or paradise.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means \"peace\".{{refn|group=note|Compare ''Pacific'' with ''pacifist'', ''pacifier''.}} The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife's death.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=80}} While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film critic [[Mark Kermode]] wrote that it can also be interpreted as a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a [[Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Zarathustra]]-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=68}} Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] argued that ''The Shawshank Redemption'' is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.<ref name=\"RebertAnaly\"/>\n\nRobbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever \"jail\" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=69}} Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life.<ref name=\"Moorhouse\"/> Philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.<ref name=\"PhilosophyNow14\"/>\n\nMany elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=37}} Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a [[film reel]] to help fight them off.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=41}} At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=38}}\n\nAndy and Red's relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men,<ref name=\"THR20\"/> that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=27}} Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.<ref name=\"PhilosophyNow14\"/>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Frank Darabont at the PaleyFest 2011 - The Walking Dead panel.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=A caucasian, bald man wearing glasses and a dark shirt: He looks down at a book and pen held in his hands.|Director Frank Darabont (pictured in 2011) bought the adaptation rights to ''The Shawshank Redemption'' for $5,000 in 1987]]\n\n===Development===\nDarabont first collaborated with author [[Stephen King]] in 1983 on the short film adaptation of \"[[The Woman in the Room]]\", buying the rights from him for $1\u2014a [[Dollar Baby|Dollar Deal]] that King used to help new directors build a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by adapting his short stories.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', Darabont returned to King with $5,000<ref name=\"Residuals\"/> to purchase the rights to adapt ''[[Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption]]'', a 96-page novella from King's 1982 collection ''[[Different Seasons]]'', written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known.<ref name=\"Variety20th\"/> Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was \"obvious\".<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: \"In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.\"<ref name=\"Shortlist\"/>\n\nFive years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist.<ref name=\"PotMGunton\"/> Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director [[Frank Capra]], including ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), describing them as [[tall tale]]s; Darabont likened ''The Shawshank Redemption'' to a tall tale more than a prison movie.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}} He also cited ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison drama ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) directed by [[John Frankenheimer]].<ref name=\"DB14\"/> While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set project ''[[Against the Wall (1994 film)|Against the Wall]]''. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.<ref name=\"deadline dec2019\"/>\n\nAt the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce ''The Shawshank Redemption''.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Director and Castle Rock co-founder [[Rob Reiner]] also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million<ref name=\"LATOct94\"/> and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Reiner, who had previously adapted King's 1982 novella ''[[The Body (King novella)|The Body]]'' into the 1986 film ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', planned to cast [[Tom Cruise]] as Andy and [[Harrison Ford]] as Red.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/><ref name=\"MSNFacts\"/>\n\nCastle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' interview, \"you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do\".<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project, instead.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film<ref name=\"EWSep3094\"/> (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits),<ref name=\"LATOct94\"/> and pre-production began in January 1993.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=9}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Clancy Brown by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|left|thumb|alt=A white man with a short white beard, and white and grey curly hair: He wears a white suit with a blue shirt.

Freeman's character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\"<ref name=\"DB14\"/> Freeman opted not to research his role, saying \"acting the part of someone who's incarcerated doesn't require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don't change.

To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer [[Niki Marvin]] arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from ''Demolition Man''. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his ''Demolition Man'' role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins', allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.<ref name=\"PotMGunton\"/>\n\nPortraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers.{{Sfn|TRF|2001|loc=22:42}} William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' television series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make.<ref name=\"AVSadler\"/> Freeman's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in [[mug shot]] photos,<ref name=\"DB14\"/> and as a prisoner shouting \"fresh fish\" as Andy arrives at Shawshank.<ref name=\"NYTExtras\"/> Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.<ref name=\"EWSep3094\"/><ref name=\"LAWarden\"/> The novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in [[Drag queen|drag clothing]].<ref name=\"LATOct94\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Mansfield OH - Reformatory - Closed.jpg|thumb|alt=A grey stone building sits at the end of a green field.|[[Ohio State Reformatory]], also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, served as the fictional Shawshank prison]]\nOn a $25 million budget,<ref name=\"BoxOffice\"/> [[principal photography]] took place over three months<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> between June and August 1993.<ref name=\"Variety1993\"/><ref name=\"avclub mansfield\"/> Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Freeman described filming as tense, saying, \"Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director.

For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film, and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, \"A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.<ref name=\"EWSep3094\"/>\n\nMarvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail.<ref name=\"LATIMES1993\"/> Marvin eventually chose the [[Ohio State Reformatory]] in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings.<ref name=\"avclub mansfield\"/><ref name=\"LATIMES1993\"/> The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990,<ref name=\"NPROnLoc\"/> due to inhumane living conditions.<ref name=\"avclub mansfield\"/>\n\nThe 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks.<ref name=\"avclub mansfield\"/> Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a [[sound stage]] built inside a nearby shuttered [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built [[Set construction|set]] housed in the Westinghouse factory,<ref name=\"avclub mansfield\"/> except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch's admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison's more confined cells.<ref name=\"EbertGreatness\"/> Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring [[Ashland, Ohio]].<ref name=\"TimesGazette\"/> The [[Shawshank tree|oak tree]] under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near [[Malabar Farm State Park]], in [[Lucas, Ohio]];<ref name=\"NYT2014\"/> it was destroyed by winds in 2016.<ref name=\"guardian16\"/>\n\n[[File:Bissman Block.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large, red-brick building with a peeling, white-painted front: A sign on the side of the building is obscured by trees, but partially reads \"The Bissman Comp...\"|The Bissman Building in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], served as the [[halfway house]] in which Brooks and later Red would reside following their release from prison]]\nJust as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red's reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of [[Saint Croix]], one of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].<ref name=\"USATOday17\"/> The beach at 'Zihuatanejo' is the [[Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge]],<ref name=\"ColumbusDispatch\"/> a protected area for [[leatherback sea turtle]]s.<ref name=\"USNews\"/> Scenes shot in [[Upper Sandusky, Ohio|Upper Sandusky]] included the prison [[wood working|wood shop]] scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop),<ref name=\"NYT2014\"/> and the opening court scene which was shot at the [[Wyandot County, Ohio|Wyandot County]] Courthouse.<ref name=\"ColumbusDispatch\"/> Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin in [[Malabar Farm State Park]], where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair,<ref name=\"SST1\"/> [[Butler, Ohio]], stood in for Buxton, Maine,<ref name=\"SST2\"/> and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.<ref name=\"SST3\"/>\n\nFor the scene depicting Andy's escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock.<ref name=\"ign darabont 2019\"/> While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a \"river of shit\", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer [[Terence Marsh]]. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and used [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] to partially decontaminate it.<ref name=\"NYTExtras\"/><ref name=\"ign darabont 2019\"/> Of the scene, Robbins said, \"when you're doing a film, you want to be a good soldier\u2014you don't want to be the one [who] gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.\"{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=75}} The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy's escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water.<ref name=\"ign darabont 2019\"/><ref name=\"GRadarOctober182019\"/> Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he \"over-lit\" it.<ref name=\"GRadarOctober182019\"/> In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.<ref name=\"ign darabont 2019\"/>\n\nAs for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off.<ref name=\"NYTExtras\"/> While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in ''Gilda'' (1946), they were originally intended to be watching [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''The Lost Weekend'' (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from [[Paramount Pictures]], producer Niki Marvin approached ''The Shawshank Redemption''{{'}}s domestic distribution rights-holder [[Columbia Pictures]], which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was ''Gilda''.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=36\u201337}} As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters.<ref name=\"ign darabont 2019\"/> Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film's production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.<ref name=\"deadline dec2019\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Post-production===\nThe final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes,<ref name=\"Runtime\"/> and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont's former agent, who died during filming from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].<ref name=\"Slant2004\"/> The film's first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered \"long\", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it.<ref name=\"THR20\"/> Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy's escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action.<ref name=\"RSCUt\"/> The film originally had a [[cold open]] that played out Andy's crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more \"punchy\" opening.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=13\u201314}} One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|pp=78\u201379}} In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying \"I am terrified, there is no way home.\" Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=79}}\n\nIn Darabont's original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a \"commercial, sappy\" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=87}} The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a \"golly-gee-ain't-we-cute\" quality and excised it.{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=86}} The beach reunion was test audiences' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: \"I think it's a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...\"{{Sfn|Kermode|2003|p=87}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|The Shawshank Redemption (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's score was composed by [[Thomas Newman]]. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, \"Shawshank Redemption\", plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a \"triumphal flourish\" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. \"So Was Red\", played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica\u2014a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player [[Tommy Morgan]] \"casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take\", and this is heard in the finished film.<ref name=\"WSJMusic\"/> Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.<ref name=\"Variety20th\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nLeading up to its release, the film was [[Test screening|test screened]] with the public. These were described as \"through the roof\", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/><ref name=\"BFI2017\"/> It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King's name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a \"more prestigious audience\", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] works such as ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' and ''[[Cujo]]''.<ref name=\"AVFilm14\"/>\n\nFollowing early September premieres at the [[Renaissance Theatre (Mansfield, Ohio)|Renaissance Theatre]] in Mansfield, and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/><ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> ''The Shawshank Redemption'' began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters\u2014an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the [[Cinerama Dome]], but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pushed crowds away.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/><ref name=\"BFI2017\"/> It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million\u2014an average of $2,545 per theater\u2014finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'' ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas.<ref name=\"Variety20th\"/><ref name=\"BoxOffice\"/> ''The Shawshank Redemption'' closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million.<ref name=\"Bomweekends\"/> It was considered a [[box-office bomb]], failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/>\n\nThe film was also competing with ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' ($108 million),<ref name=\"Residuals\"/> which also premiered October 14 following its [[Palme d'Or]] award win, and ''Forrest Gump'' ($330 million),<ref name=\"Residuals\"/> which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run.<ref name=\"BFI2017\"/> Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was also considered to work against the commercial success of ''The Shawshank Redemption''.<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable,<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> while Robbins recalled fans asking: \"What was that ''Shinkshonk Reduction'' thing?\".<ref name=\"Empire1\"/> Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title.<ref name=\"AVSadler\"/> The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity of [[prison film]]s, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.<ref name=\"Empire1\"/><ref name=\"deadline dec2019\"/>\n\nAfter being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995,<ref name=\"vanityfair\"/> the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Bomweekends\"/><ref name=\"deadline dec2019\"/> In total, the film grossed $28.3&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BoxOffice\"/> and $45&nbsp;million<ref name=ww>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 19, 1996|page=1|last=Klady|first=Leonard|title=B.O. with a vengeance: $9.1 billion worldwide}}</ref> from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3&nbsp;million.

In a 2014 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article, based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, ''The Shawshank Redemption'' had made an estimated $100 million.
