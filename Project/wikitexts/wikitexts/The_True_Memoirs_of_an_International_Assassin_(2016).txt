The film stars [[Kevin James]], [[Zulay Henao]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Maurice Compte]], [[Kelen Coleman]], [[Andrew Howard]], and [[Rob Riggle]]. The film was released on November 11, 2016.<ref name=\"Release\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=December 2016}}\nSam Larson ([[Kevin James]]) is a loner who has written a fictional novel, ''Memoirs of an International Assassin'',  but is having trouble with the ending, the signature line  at the end. After discussing his problem with his good friend Amos ([[Ron Rifkin]]) and receiving an outlandish story about an assassin named Ghost, Larson decides to incorporate what Amos tells him into his novel. The novel is published online and is classified as nonfiction, retitled ''True Memoirs of an International Assassin''.\n\nNow a bestseller, Larson is kidnapped and taken to Venezuela.  Larson is awakened by El Toro ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]), a revolutionary who wants the assassination of the President of Venezuela, Miguel Cueto ([[Kim Coates]]), who believes the novel to be the truth and tasks Larson with the assassination.\n\nLarson escapes the revolutionaries and goes to the nearest police station, where he asks to be taken to the US embassy, but discovers they are the gangster Anton Masovich's ([[Andrew Howard]]) henchmen, and they demand money. Larson then calls Applebaum, but believing that he is just playing with her, she hangs up. Before the police can kill him, Larson is saved by DEA agent, Rosa Bolivar ([[Zulay Henao]]).\n\nAfter they escape, Bolivar asks Larson to talk with Masovich to clear up the situation. There, Masovich asks Larson to kill El Toro, as he would be affected should the president be killed. Larson pretends to agree after seeing Masovich's violent behavior. Meanwhile, CIA agents William Cobb ([[Rob Riggle]]) and Michael Cleveland (Leonard Earl Howze) meet with the president and General Ruiz ([[Yul Vazquez]]) regarding Larson, and they agree to meet with him.\n\nLarson and Bolivar, while talking about the situation at a restaurant, are found by Juan, who takes Larson hostage. Juan and Larson then talk about the situation regarding the President. Larson tries to get Juan to steal a truck, but in the process, he gets captured by General Ruiz. General Ruiz then tells Larson to kill Masovich (as he has too much power) or Larson will be tried and executed for his involvement with killing the president, prompting Larson to agree. Cobb and Cleveland, who noticed this, decide to get him killed by filling in Masovich, who goes into a violent rage upon hearing that Larson betrayed him.\n\nLarson meets Bolivar and fills her in, who then admits she has always wanted to kill Masovich, as he caused the DEA to write her off. She comes up with a plan to humiliate both Masovich and the president. Larson initially refuses, stating he just wants to go home. They are then promptly attacked by Masovich's minions, and escape, but not before he gets shot in the shoulder.\n\nLarson and Bolivar then return to El Toro's, getting an army to infiltrate the inauguration ball and murder the president. When they arrive, Ruiz reminds Larson to kill Masovich., Masovich then spots Larson and attempts to kill him, but Bolivar distracts him. Juan, disguised as a waiter, reminds him of El Toro's orders. After they dance, Bolivar and Masovich fight upstairs, while Larson forces the president to confess his plan to kill Masovich. The president finds out Larson has recorded him but, being depressed and hating his life, promptly kills himself. Meanwhile, the fight between Bolivar and Masovich reaches the president's office and ends with Masovich getting shot and killed by Ruiz.\n\nLarson and Bolivar then get arrested by General Ruiz, but are sent back to El Toro's, and Juan apologizes to Larson for not believing him. Bolivar is hired for the revolution by El Toro, and El Toro takes Larson alone, preparing to kill him (as he knows too much). Cobb and Cleveland interrupt him, as they are asked to take him home. Larson is happy to go, but worried about Bolivar. At the airport, Larson escapes to try to save Bolivar, who is being held by El Toro for information. Just as Juan is about to kill her, Larson appears, armed.\n\nLarson convinces Juan to take his side, they fight El Toro and attempt to free Bolivar. However, they are defeated, and El Toro takes Bolivar in his helicopter. Juan convinces Larson not to give up, and so he follows them onto it. After a brief struggle, Larson finally kills El Toro, who remarks that he always knew Larson was the Ghost. Larson and Bolivar then jump out of the helicopter and land in the water. Then, cornered by General Ruiz (who plans to take over the country), they are about to be killed by him, but then he's shot by Amos (the real Ghost), who disappears.\n\nSix months later, Juan is the president of Venezuela, with Bolivar watching. Cobb and Cleveland, who are also watching, remark that he will be hard to control and that they hate the Ghost. Larson has become a bestselling author, having released his new book, which includes some of his Venezuela adventures. At a TV interview with Katie Couric, she asks him whether the book was real, and Larson denies it, saying it is a work of fiction.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin James]] as Sam Larson (pretending to be the assassin known as \"The Ghost\").<ref name=\"May2015TW\" />\n* [[Zulay Henao]]<ref name=\"HenaoCast\" /> as DEA Agent Rosa Bolivar\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as El Toro<ref name=\"GarciaCast\" />\n* [[Maurice Compte]] as Juan<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Kelen Coleman]] as Kylie Applebaum<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Andrew Howard]] as Anton Masovich<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Amos AKA The Ghost<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as William Cobb<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Leonard Earl Howze]] as Michael Cleveland<ref name=\"Feb2016CS\" />\n* [[Yul Vazquez]] as Gen.
