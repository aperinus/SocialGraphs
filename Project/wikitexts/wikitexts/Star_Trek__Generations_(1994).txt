[[Malcolm McDowell]] joins cast members from the 1960s television show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and the 1987 sequel series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'', including [[William Shatner]] and [[Patrick Stewart]]. In the film, Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] joins forces with Captain [[James T. Kirk]] to stop the villain Tolian Soran from destroying a [[planetary system]] in his attempt to return to an extra-dimensional realm known as the Nexus.\n\n''Generations'' was conceived as a handoff from the original cast of the ''Star Trek'' films to the cast of ''The Next Generation''. After developing several film ideas concurrently, the producers chose a script written by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[Brannon Braga]]. Production began while the final season of the television series was being made. The director was [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]], who previously directed episodes of the television series; photography was by franchise newcomer [[John A. Alonzo]]. Filming took place on the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] lots, and on location in [[Valley of Fire State Park]], [[Nevada]], and [[Lone Pine, California]]. The film's climax was revised and reshot following poor reception from test audiences. The film uses a mix of [[Practical effect|traditional optical effects]] alongside [[computer-generated imagery]], and was scored by regular ''Star Trek'' composer [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]].\n\n''Star Trek Generations'' was released in the United States on November 18, 1994. Paramount promoted the film with merchandising tie-ins, including toys, books, games, and a website\u2014a first for a major motion picture. The film opened at the top of the United States box office its first week of release and grossed a total of $118&nbsp;million worldwide. Critical reception was mixed, with critics divided on the film's characters and comprehensibility to a casual viewer.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2293, retired [[Starfleet]] officers [[James T. Kirk]], [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]], and [[Pavel Chekov]] attend the maiden voyage of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)|USS ''Enterprise''-B]]. During the [[shakedown cruise]], the starship is pressed into a rescue-mission to save two [[El-Aurian]] refugee ships that have been snared by a massive energy ribbon. The ''Enterprise'' is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but becomes trapped by the ribbon, and Kirk goes to a control room to help the ship escape. While the ''Enterprise'' is freed, Kirk is presumed lost in space and dead after the trailing-end of the ribbon tears open the ship's hull.\n\nIn 2371, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] is in a [[holodeck]] computer simulation, celebrating the promotion of shipmate [[Worf]] to lieutenant commander. Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] learns his brother and nephew have been killed in a fire and is distraught that the Picard family line will end with him. The ''Enterprise'' receives a distress call from a stellar observatory, where an El-Aurian, Dr. Tolian Soran, launches a probe at the nearby star. The probe causes the star to implode, creating a shockwave that destroys its planetary system. Soran kidnaps ''Enterprise'' engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] and is transported off the station by a [[Klingon starships|Klingon Bird of Prey]] belonging to the [[Duras sisters]].\n\n''Enterprise'' crewmember [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]] tells Picard that she and Soran were among the El-Aurians rescued in 2293. Soran is obsessed with reentering the energy ribbon to reach the \"Nexus,\" an extra-dimensional realm that exists outside of normal space-time. Soran\u2014who lost his family when their homeworld was destroyed\u2014wants to escape death through the Nexus, which Guinan describes as \"pure joy,\" and where time has no meaning. Picard and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship directly into the ribbon, is altering its path by removing the gravitational effects of nearby stars. He plans to destroy another star to bring the ribbon to him on the planet Veridian III, consequently killing millions on a nearby inhabited planet.\n\nUpon entering the Veridian-system, Picard offers himself to the Duras sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran directly. La Forge is returned to the ''Enterprise'', but unwittingly exposes the ship's defense details through the transmitter installed in his [[VISOR]] device. The Duras sisters attack, and the ''Enterprise'' sustains critical damage before destroying the Bird of Prey by rigging their cloaking device and firing photon torpedoes. When La Forge reports that the starship is about to suffer a warp-core breach as a result of the attack, Commander [[William Riker]] evacuates everyone to the forward saucer-section of the starship, which separates from the engineering section just before the breach occurs. The resulting shockwave sends the saucer-section crashing onto the surface of Veridian III, damaging it beyond repair.\n\nPicard fails to stop Soran, as he succeeds in launching another probe into the Veridian system's star, resulting in a similar shockwave to the one that destroyed the observatory. The destruction of the Veridian star and the disappearance of its gravitational force alters the course of the ribbon, the shockwave causes the destruction of Veridian III, the ''Enterprise'', and its crew but not before Soran and Picard enter the Nexus, and Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealized family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an \"echo\" of Guinan left behind in the Nexus. Guinan sends him to meet James T. Kirk, safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is initially entranced by the opportunity to atone for past regrets, he realizes it lacks danger and excitement. Having learned that they can travel whenever and wherever desired through the Nexus, Picard convinces Kirk to return with him to Veridian III, shortly before Soran launches the probe.\n\nWorking together, Kirk and Picard distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the probe in place; it explodes on the launchpad and kills Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort and, after he dies, Picard buries him on the mountain with his \"captain\" badge. Three [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starships arrive to retrieve the ''Enterprise''-survivors from Veridian III. Picard muses that given the ship's legacy, the ''Enterprise''-D will not be the last vessel to carry the name.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Mcdowellgfdl.PNG|thumb|left|alt=A light-skinned, white-haired elderly man talks with a microphone and gestures with his free hand.|Malcolm McDowell (pictured in 2007) requested his character not have alien features to avoid lengthy sessions in the makeup chair.]]\nThe main cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' reprise their roles in ''Generations'': [[Patrick Stewart]] as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, [[Jonathan Frakes]] as Commander William Riker, [[LeVar Burton]] as Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, [[Brent Spiner]] as Lieutenant Commander Data, [[Gates McFadden]] as Chief Medical Officer Commander [[Beverly Crusher]], [[Michael Dorn]] as Lieutenant Commander [[Worf]], and [[Marina Sirtis]] as ship's counselor Commander [[Deanna Troi]].

Other requests included a [[Khan Noonien Singh]]-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot.<ref name=\"braga-moore\"/> At one point, the writers toyed with the idea of pitting the two crews against each other. \"We were obsessed with the poster image of the two ''Enterprises'' locked in combat: ''Kirk vs. Picard, One Must Die!''\" said Moore.<ref name=\"housley-1994\"/> Ultimately, the writers could not come up with a plausible explanation for such a conflict, and abandoned the idea.<ref name=\"dillard-novelization\"/>{{rp|248}}\n\nIn the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot would have been the entire cast crammed into an elevator, happy to be back together.<ref name=\"braga-moore\"/> The ''Enterprise''-D's destruction also appeared\u2014the saucer crash had first been proposed by Moore as the conclusion to part one of a sixth-season cliffhanger story that was scrapped.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} Kirk's death was developed in Braga, Moore, and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that \"we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list.\" After the idea of killing off a ''Next Generation'' cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. \"We all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it,' \" Moore said. The studio and Shatner had few concerns about the plot point.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}}\n\nRefining the script meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho, and the [[Midwestern United States]], and the total budget was over $30&nbsp;million. The budget dropped to $25&nbsp;million after negotiations.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} A revised version of the script from March 1994 incorporated feedback from the producers, studio, actors, and director. The writers changed one sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the ''Enterprise''-B's operation after Shatner felt the scene's joke went too far. Picard's personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert's heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family to add emotional impact.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|310}} The opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]-influenced characters talking shortly before an enemy attack; ''Next Generation'' writer [[Jeri Taylor]] suggested that the opening should be something \"fun\", leading to the switch to the holodeck scene.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|311}}\n\nNimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|309}} The producers chose [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]]. The British director had no feature film experience, but had directed several episodes of ''Star Trek'', including the popular ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]\" and the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' pilot \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\".<ref>{{cite news |title=David Carson: Director |author=Shapiro, Marc |work=Star Trek Generations: Official Movie Souvenir Magazine |publisher=Titan Magazines |date=January 1995}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\n''Star Trek'' veteran [[Herman Zimmerman]] served as [[production designer]], collaborating with illustrator [[John Eaves]] for many designs.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|312}} Zimmerman's approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s approach to ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', Zimmerman noted that future humanity will still have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\">{{cite journal|author1=Edgerly, Philip Thomas |author2=Zimmerman, Herman |date=December 1994|title=Architrek: Designing Generations|journal=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]}}</ref>{{rp|52}}\n\nTransitioning from television to film meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; he had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked, but never had the time or money to rework it.<ref name=\"edgerly-1994\"/>{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\nThe script called for an entirely new location on the ''Enterprise''-D: stellar cartography. The script described the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a three-story circular set to give the impression the actors were inside a star map dominated by screens.

He later wrote that the production moved at a \"TV-like\" pace; principal photography concluded after 51 days.<ref name=\"bluray-commentary\"/>{{rp|7'10\"\u20137'45\"}}\n\nFilming commenced on March 28, 1994. ''Generations'' and ''The Next Generation'' were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on the Paramount Studios lot. Scenes that did not feature the television series regulars were filmed first,<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|307}} starting with those in the ''Enterprise''-B deflector room. The scenes of Harriman, Chekov, and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nStage 7 was where the ''Enterprise''-B's bridge, deflector room, and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The stellar observatory set was an elaborate redress of the ''Enterprise''-B's bridge, with added levels and swapped walls changing the layout.

When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. \"[We had] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out,\" Knoll recalled.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|78\u201379}}\n\nPrevious ''Star Trek'' films had used conventional [[Motion control photography|motion control]] techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For ''Generations'', the effects artists began using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and models for certain shots.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|78}} No physical shooting models were built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he created a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to develop his ideas from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|84}} Other CG elements included the solar collapses and the Veridian III planet.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|319}} Knoll used a digital version of the ''Enterprise''-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and [[slitscan]] effect for the original meant that the effect \"barely holds up\", Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|88}} While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built; these included the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.<ref name=\"nemecek-2003\"/>{{rp|320}}\n\nThe climactic battle between the ''Enterprise'' and the Klingons over Veridian III was accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects. The destruction of the Bird of Prey was a reuse of footage from ''The Undiscovered Country''. Weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the [[photon torpedoes]]. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from ''The Motion Picture'', Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required\u2014shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment\u2014to recreate the look optically.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|80\u201381}}\n\n[[File:Startrek generationshd0192 nexusribbon.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The ribbon and the ''Enterprise'' in this scene are computer-generated; because the camera is following ''Enterprise'' so closely, the effects artists had to make sure the modeling held up to the scrutiny of the big screen.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|86}}|alt=A close-up view of the hull of a Starship surrounded by a ribbonlike vortex of reddish-purple electric energy.]]\nCarson described the Nexus energy ribbon as the true villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural frame of reference.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|81\u201382}} \"When creating something from scratch, it's always important to rough out the whole thing... because there are so many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down,\" recalled effects co-supervisor Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country#Effects|planetary explosion of Praxis]] from ''The Undiscovered Country''.<ref name=\"magid-1995\"/>{{rp|83}} Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] simulation.

The film's opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the ''Enterprise''-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on ''The Next Generation''), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.<ref name=\"bond-1999\">{{cite book |author=Bond, Jeff |year=1999 |title=The Music of Star Trek |publisher=Lone Eagle Publishing Company |isbn=1580650120}}</ref>{{rp|152}}\n\nMcCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film's action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the ''Enterprise''-D. For Picard's trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard's discovery of his family. A broad fanfare\u2014the film's only distinct theme\u2014first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. This theme blends McCarthy's theme for Picard from ''The Next Generation''{{'s}} first season, notes from the theme for ''Deep Space Nine'', and [[Alexander Courage]]'s [[Theme from Star Trek|''Star Trek'' theme]]. For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk's death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk's grave is scored with more pomp.
