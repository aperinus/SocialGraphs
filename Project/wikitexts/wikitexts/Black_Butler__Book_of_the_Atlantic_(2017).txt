Ciel, Sebastian, and Snake board the luxury liner ''Campania'' on her maiden voyage to investigate the mysterious Aurora Society, rumored to perform unethical experiments to raise the dead. On board is also Elizabeth and her family. In a secret Aurora Society meeting, Ciel and Sebastian witness Doctor Rian Stoker use a machine to reanimate a dead woman, who starts attacking and killing the attendants. Ciel finds himself trapped in the ship's cargo with Elizabeth and Snake, where they realize that Stoker brought thousands more reanimated corpses on board. Sebastian rescues them. Upon interrogating Stoker, Ciel discovers that an even larger batch of corpses is stored in another area of the ship; that batch promptly awakens and begin killing the ship's crew and passengers. Amidst the chaos, the ship crashes into an iceberg and starts sinking, giving Sebastian and the Grim Reapers, including Grell, only a few hours.\n\nThe group discovers that Undertaker was behind the reanimated corpses and is a Grim Reaper himself. While fighting him, Sebastian is wounded by Undertaker's death scythe and his Cinematic Reel is played; Undertaker witnesses the early moments of Ciel and Sebastian's relationship, when Ciel summoned the demon, when they returned home, and Sebastian training Ciel for his royal duties until he re-entered society, receiving his title as Earl Phantomhive. Stoker falls to his death; Ciel is able to snatch Undertaker's funeral lockets as the Reaper escapes. Sebastian and Ciel barely escape the sunken ship on a lifeboat but find themselves surrounded by the remaining corpses. Knowing that the corpses will attack the other survivors should they attempt to escape, Sebastian has no choice but to fight all of them himself to protect Ciel. At dawn, with all corpses disposed of, a rescue boat appears to save them.\n\nIn the post-credits, William rescues Grell and Ronald, scolding them for failing in their task, while Sebastian and Ciel meet their friends aboard the rescue boat.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
