He receives a call from Tarzan who informs Mike that Dallas is \"gone.\" Believing that his former boss has died, Mike goes to a hotel to find his friends, the remaining Kings of Tampa, at a pool party.\n\nAfter revealing Dallas bailed on them to start a new show in [[Macau]] and only took \"The Kid\" (referencing Adam from ''Magic Mike'') with him, the Kings let Mike in on their plan: to end their careers on a high note at the Myrtle Beach male stripping convention. Later, while trying to work, Mike dances to a song he used to strip to. Reinvigorated, Mike decides to join them on their trip.\n\nDriving in a fro-yo van owned by Tito and Tobias, they make their first stop at Mad Mary's. To prove to Richie he's willing to commit to the trip, Mike participates in an amateur drag queen contest, and the others join him shortly. They then go to a beach where Mike resolves his issues with Ken through violence. Mike also meets a photographer named Zoe who tells him that she's off to New York. They flirt but agree to not have sex.\n\nBack on the road, Mike suggests that they change their routine after the group (excepting Tarzan) take [[MDMA]]. At a gas station he coerces Richie into trying to make the cashier smile with an improvised striptease. This inspires the others to abandon their old routines. Soon after, Tobias passes out while driving and crashes.\n\nEveryone but he is left unscathed, and he gets a concussion. In the hospital, they begin to lose morale, and contemplate quitting and heading home. Mike then reveals that his furniture business isn't going that well and that he's no longer with Brooke after she rejected his proposal. The group decides to continue on.\n\nIn search of a new MC, Mike brings the group to a [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] strip club owned by Rome, a woman Mike has a history with. Despite proving to her that his skills haven't deteriorated, he's unsuccessful in getting her to help them. However, she does give them a ride to their next stop by having Andre, a rapper/singer who works at the club, drive them.\n\nArriving at a mansion, Tito tells them he knows the girl who lives there and she's expecting them. Walking in, they are greeted by her mother, Nancy, and her friends, all middle-aged women. Nancy's teasing initially makes them feel awkward but as the night goes on, the mood lightens. Mike meets Zoe again, and she tells him about another photographer, under the guise of needing an assistant, tried to have an extramarital affair with her. Mike urges her to regain her smile at the convention.\n\nAfter sleeping with Richie, Nancy lets them drive her ex-husband's car to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]. Upon arrival, they are surprised to see Rome. She had a change of heart, agreeing to be their MC. Andre and Malik also came to help. With preparations complete, they head to the convention where they squeeze in a spot thanks to Rome and her history with the organizer of the event, Paris. The group's performance is a success. During Mike and Malik's performance, Mike brings Zoe on stage. The film ends in celebration, Tobias returning with the fro-yo van and everyone watching the 4th of July fireworks.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150\n   | footer    = Gregory Jacobs (''top''), Channing Tatum (''middle'') and Joe Manganiello (''bottom'') at the premiere of ''Magic Mike XXL'' in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]\n   | image1    = Gregory Jacobs 2015.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Channing Tatum (18842022673).jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n   | image3    = Joe Manganiello Magic Mike XXL 2015.jpg\n   | alt3      =\n   | caption3  =\n}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Michael \u201cMagic Mike\u201d Lane<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/577669/channing-tatum-talks-magic-mike-xxl-and-sexy-zac-efron-faces-fear-of-porcelain-dolls-watch|title=Channing Tatum Talks Magic Mike XXL and \"Sexy\" Zac Efron, Faces Fear of Porcelain Dolls\u2014Watch!|work=[[E!
