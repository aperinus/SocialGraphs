Elias Merhige]] and starring [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. The film was produced by [[Tom Cruise]]'s co-owned company [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]]. It was a [[box office bomb]] failing to earn half of its estimated $27 million production costs at the box office.\n\nThe film is about the hunt for Suspect Zero, a potential serial killer who is able to kill indefinitely because he is able to remain undetectable by law enforcement agencies. It features various elements from declassified DIA [[Stargate Project|Stargate]] remote viewing protocols.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001300050001-3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123161913/https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001300050001-3.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 23, 2017|title=Standard Remote-Viewing Protocol (Local Targets)|last=Targ|first=Russell|publisher=CIA|page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTraveling salesman Harold Speck is approached by a man in a diner who asks him an uncomfortable question. After leaving the diner, Harold is found dead with his eyelids cut off and clutching a symbol consisting of a circle with a line through it. The murder is investigated by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Thomas Mackelway ([[Aaron Eckhart]]), who was recently suspended for beating suspected [[serial killer]] Raymond Starkey. Mackelway receives a series of taunting [[fax]]es from someone who may be Speck's killer. As the investigation proceeds, Mackelway and his partner, Fran Kulok ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), become aware of the possible existence of Suspect Zero, a \"super serial killer\" responsible for hundreds of deaths who leaves no evidence behind to link his crimes together.\n\nAnother body is found in the trunk of a car bearing an [[modus operandi|M.O.]] similar to Speck's murder. The ownership of the car is traced to a room in a halfway house occupied by Benjamin O'Ryan. The agents discover that the room is filled with [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] sketches of the crossed-circle symbol, a [[Bible]] which contains sketches of missing persons, and a book on [[ritual]]. Questioning the other occupants of the halfway house, Mackelway is told by one of them the symbol represents a [[zero]], not a circle. Information sent by the killer leads Mackelway to O'Ryan ([[Ben Kingsley]]), who believes himself to be a former member of the FBI. The agents must decide if O'Ryan is the key to catching Suspect Zero, or if he is Suspect Zero himself.\n\nOutside a bar, O'Ryan kills a man who attempts to kidnap and rape a young girl. When Mackelway and Kulok arrive, they find that the body belongs to Starkey, who had been released from prison. Evidence reveals that O'Ryan was part of Project Icarus, a secret government project attempting to cultivate [[remote viewing|telepathic abilities]] in individuals for military purposes. The experiments gave O'Ryan the ability to see the actions of serial killers, driving him to hunt them down. O'Ryan demonstrates that Mackelway shares his abilities to some degree. Neither Kulok nor Mackelway's superiors are convinced by his theories that O'Ryan is chasing the killer rather than being the killer.\n\nSuspect Zero is revealed to be a man who drives cross-country in a [[refrigerated truck]]. He targets children, whom he abducts and transports to his ranch, where he kills them. Mackelway links these crimes by recognizing that victims had signs of [[freezer burn]]s while being transported. Mackelway chases one truck driver to a carnival, only to find that the child he saw in his vision as \"captured\" is free. O'Ryan suddenly appears and captures Mackelway. After refusing to be frightened, O'Ryan spares Mackelway. Eventually, the two men track Suspect Zero to his ranch and find numerous shallow graves. Chasing him, both vehicles crash off the road. Kulok manages to free a child while Mackelway kills Suspect Zero. O'Ryan then tries to convince Mackelway to end his suffering by killing him. When Mackelway refuses, O'Ryan pretends to attack him, [[suicide by cop|prompting Kulok to shoot him]] to defend her partner.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Aaron Eckhart]] &ndash; Thomas Mackelway\n*[[Ben Kingsley]] &ndash; Benjamin O'Ryan\n*[[Carrie-Anne Moss]] &ndash; Fran Kulok\n*[[Kevin Chamberlin]] &ndash; Harold Speck\n*[[Harry Lennix|Harry J.
