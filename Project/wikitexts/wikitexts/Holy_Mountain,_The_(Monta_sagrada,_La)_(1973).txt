Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]] put up production money. It was shown at various international film festivals in 1973, including [[1973 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2309/year/1973.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Holy Mountain |access-date=20 April 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and [[Limited release|limited screenings]] in New York and San Francisco.\n\n==Plot==\nA man (later identified as the thief), representing [[The Fool (Tarot card)|The Fool]] tarot card, lies in the desert with flies covering his face. He is befriended by a footless, handless dwarf representing the [[Five of Swords]], and the pair travel into the city where they make money entertaining tourists. Because the thief resembles [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in appearance, some locals \u2014 a nun and three warriors \u2014 cast an impression of his body and sell the resulting crucifixes. After a dispute with a priest, the thief eats off the face of his wax statue and sends it skyward with balloons, symbolically eating the body of Christ and offering \"himself\" up to Heaven. Soon after, he notices a crowd gathered around a tall tower, where a large hook with a bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food.\n\nThe thief, wishing to find the source of the gold, ascends the tower. There he finds the [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and his silent assistant. After a confrontation with the alchemist, the thief defecates into a container. The excrement is transformed into gold by the alchemist, who proclaims: \"You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold.\" The thief accepts the gold, but smashes a mirror with the gold when shown his reflection. The alchemist then takes the thief as an apprentice.\n\nThe thief is introduced to seven people who will accompany him on his journey. Each is introduced as a personification of one of the planets, in particular the negative characteristics that are associated with the respective planet. They consist of a cosmetics manufacturer representing Venus, a weapons manufacturer representing Mars, a millionaire art dealer representing Jupiter, a war toy maker representing Saturn, a political financial advisor representing Uranus, a police chief representing Neptune, and an architect representing Pluto. The alchemist instructs the seven to burn their money as well as wax effigies of themselves. Together with the alchemist, the thief, and the alchemist's assistant, they form a group of ten.\n\nThe characters are led by the alchemist through various transformation rituals. The ten journey by boat to \"[[Lotus-eaters|Lotus Island]]\" in order to gain the secret of immortality from nine immortal masters who live on a holy mountain. Once on Lotus Island they are sidetracked by the Pantheon Bar, a cemetery party where people have abandoned their quest for the holy mountain and instead engage in drugs, poetry, or acts of physical prowess. Leaving the bar behind, they ascend the mountain. Each has a personal symbolic vision representing their worst fears and obsessions.\n\nNear the top, the thief is sent back to his \"people\" along with a young prostitute and an ape who have followed him from the city to the mountain. The rest confront the cloaked immortals, who are shown to be only faceless dummies. The alchemist then breaks the [[fourth wall]] with the command \"Zoom back, camera!\" and reveals the film apparatus (cameras, microphones, lights, and crew) just outside the frame. He instructs everyone, including the audience of the film, to leave the holy mountain: \"Goodbye Holy Mountain, Real life awaits us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] as The Alchemist\n* Horacio Salinas as The Thief\n* Ramona Saunders as The Written Woman\n* [[Juan Ferrara]] as Fon\n* Adriana Page as Isla\n* Burt Kleiner as Klen\n* Valerie Jodorowsky as Sel\n* Nicky Nichols as Berg\n* Richard Rutowsky as Axon\n* Luis Lomel\u00ed as Lut\n* Ana de Sade as The Prostitute\n* David Silva as Fon's Father\n* Basilio Gonz\u00e1lez as The Crippled Man\n* Lupita Peruyero as Berg's Wife\n* H\u00e9ctor Ortega as Drug's Master\n* Connie de la Mora as Bald Woman\n* Leticia Robles as Bald Woman\n* [[Blanca S\u00e1nchez]] as Woman with Mirror\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration===\nThe film is based on ''[[Ascent of Mount Carmel]]'' by [[John of the Cross]] and ''[[Mount Analogue]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Daumal]], who was a student of [[George Gurdjieff]]. In this film, much of Jodorowsky's visually psychedelic story follows the metaphysical thrust of ''Mount Analogue''. This is revealed in such events as the climb to the alchemist, the assembly of individuals with specific skills, the discovery of the mountain that unites Heaven and Earth \"that cannot ''not'' exist\", and symbolic challenges along the mountain ascent. Daumal died before finishing his allegorical novel, and Jodorowsky's improvised ending provides a way of completing the work (both symbolically and otherwise).{{original research inline|date=February 2021}}\n\n===Preparation===\nBefore the principal photography would commence, Jodorowsky and his wife spent a week without sleep under the direction of a Japanese Zen master.<ref name=\"ErnestXavier2007\" />\n\nThe central members of the cast spent three months doing various spiritual exercises guided by [[Oscar Ichazo]] of the [[Arica Institute]]. The Arica training features [[Zen]], [[Sufi]] and [[yoga]] exercises along with eclectic concepts drawn from the [[Kabbalah]], the ''[[I Ching]]'' and the teachings of [[George Gurdjieff]]. After the training, the group lived for one month communally in Jodorowsky's home before production.<ref name=\"ErnestXavier2007\" /> Thereafter, the filming started in early 1972. The film was shot sequentially, entirely in Mexico, at a budget of $750,000.<ref name=\"ErnestXavier2007\" />\n\nJodorowsky was also instructed by Ichazo to take [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] for the purpose of spiritual exploration. He also administered [[psilocybin mushrooms]] to the actors during the shooting of the death-rebirth scene.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Holy Mountain'' was completed just in time for the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]], where it was much awaited.<ref>{{cite news |date=23 April 1973 |title='Mountain' to be Shown at Cannes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/167074825 |author=Staff Writer |work=The Los Angeles Times |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=26 September 2017 |archive-date=27 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927161616/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/167074825/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jodorowsky edited out twenty minutes of dialogue from the film, with the intention of removing as much dialogue as he could.<ref name=\"ErnestXavier2007\">{{cite book|last1=Ernest|first1=Mathijs|last2=Xavier|first2=Mendik|title=The Cult Film Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA292|year=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|pages=291\u2013292}}</ref> The film had its premiere at [[Waverly Theatre]], an art house movie theater in New York City on 29 November 1973, where it had restricted run at midnights on Friday and Saturday for sixteen months.<ref name=\"HobermanRosenbaum1983\">{{cite book|last1=Hoberman|first1=J.|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Jonathan|title=Midnight Movies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DI20AAAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=978-0-06-015052-5|page=107}}</ref><ref name=\"klein1974\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/they-kill-animals-and-they-call-it-art-more-and-more-directors-are.html |title=They Kill Animals And They Call It Art |last=Klein |first=Theodore |author-link=T.E.D.
