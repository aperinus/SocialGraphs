It features appearances from several musicians prominent in the early 1990s [[grunge]] movement in Seattle.\n\nThe film was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and released theatrically on September 18, 1992 to generally positive reviews from critics and moderate box office success, grossing over $18 million.\n\n==Plot==\n''Singles'' centers on the precarious romantic lives of a group of young [[Generation X|Gen X'ers]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] at the height of the 1990s [[grunge]] phenomenon. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment block, a sign in front of which advertises \"Singles\" (single bedroom apartments) for rent. Divided into chapters, the film focuses on the course of two couples' rocky romances, as well as the love lives of their friends and associates.\n\nThe film revolves around Janet Livermore, a coffee-bar waitress fawning over Cliff Poncier, an aspiring yet slightly aloof grunge rock musician of the fictional grunge/rock band Citizen Dick; Linda Powell and Steve Dunne, a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other; and Debbie Hunt, who is trying to find Mr. Right.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Janet Livermore\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Steve Dunne\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Linda Powell\n* [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as Debbie Hunt\n* [[Jim True-Frost]] as David Bailey\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Cliff Poncier\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Dr. Jeffrey Jamison\n* [[James LeGros]] as Andy\n* Devon Raymond as Ruth\n* Camilo Gallardo as Luiz\n* [[Ally Walker]] as Pam\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as The Mime\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Doug Hughley\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Mayor Weber\n* [[Peter Horton]] as Jamie\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Eddie Vedder]], [[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] play the band members of Citizen Dick.

[[Paul Giamatti]] appears in a minor role.\n\n[[Johnny Depp]] was offered the role of Steve Dunne but declined.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chacksfield|first=Marc|title=Cameron Crowe On Cusack, Cruise and Zoos |url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/cameron-crowe|work=[[ShortList]]|date=March 12, 2012|access-date=October 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nFilming began on March 11, 1991.

March 5, 1993.</ref> During the making of the film, Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band, Citizen Dick. Chris Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles, and \"[[Spoonman]]\" was one of them. An early [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] version of the song was created and can be heard in the background during a scene of the film. Citizen Dick's song \"Touch Me, I'm Dick\" is a parody of the song \"[[Touch Me I'm Sick|Touch Me, I'm Sick]]\" by the Seattle band [[Mudhoney]]. On the inside cover photo of the [[Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]], there is a Citizen Dick CD with the track listing on the CD itself. One of the songs is called \"Louder Than Larry (Steiner)\", a wordplay on the Soundgarden album, ''[[Louder Than Love]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Singles'' holds a 79% critical approval rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 52 reviews with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 7/10.
