It was directed by [[Philip Kaufman]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]], and stars [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Juliette Binoche]] and [[Lena Olin]]. The film portrays [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] artistic and intellectual life during the [[Prague Spring]], and the effect on the main characters of the communist repression that resulted from the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.\n\n==Plot==\nTomas, a successful brain surgeon in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|communist Czechoslovakia]], is pursuing an affair with Sabina, an equally carefree artist in [[Prague]]. Tomas takes a trip to a spa town to conduct a specialized surgery. There he encounters dissatisfied waitress Tereza, who desires intellectual stimulation. She later tracks him down in Prague and moves in with him, complicating Tomas's affairs.\n\nTomas asks Sabina to help Tereza find work as a photographer. Tereza is both fascinated and jealous when she grasps that Sabina and Tomas are lovers, but nevertheless still develops an affectionate friendship with Sabina. Tomas marries Tereza in a simple ceremony, with both perpetually laughing. She continues to be distressed by Tomas's promiscuity, and though she considers leaving him, she becomes more attached when the [[Soviet Army]] invades Czechoslovakia. Amid the confusion, Tereza photographs demonstrations against the Soviet forces, then hands the rolls of film to foreigners to smuggle to the West. Unwilling to face the stultifying reality that is replacing the [[Prague Spring]], Tomas, Sabina, and Tereza flee Czechoslovakia for Switzerland; Sabina leaves first, later followed by the hesitant Tomas and Tereza.\n\nIn [[Geneva]], Sabina meets Franz, a married university professor; they begin a love affair. He eventually decides to abandon his wife and family for her. After hearing his plans, Sabina abandons him, feeling he would emotionally weigh her down. Meanwhile, Tereza and Tomas attempt to adapt to Switzerland, but Tereza finds the people inhospitable. When she discovers that Tomas continues to womanize, she leaves him and returns to Czechoslovakia. Upset by her leaving, Tomas follows Tereza to Czechoslovakia, where his passport is confiscated, preventing him from leaving again; his return elates Tereza, and they are reunited.\n\nTomas attempts to resume his practice; however, a scathing article he wrote before the invasion, criticizing the Soviet-backed Czech r\u00e9gime, has rendered him a political dissident. The r\u00e9gime demands his signature to a letter repudiating the article, claiming that Tomas's article fueled [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment. Tomas refuses and is apparently [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] from practicing medicine. He finds work as a window washer and continues to womanize, seducing the daughter of a high-ranking official.\n\nAs a waitress, Tereza meets an engineer who propositions her. Aware of Tomas's infidelities, she engages in a single, passionless sexual liaison with the engineer. Remorseful, she fears the engineer might have been a secret agent for the r\u00e9gime, who might denounce her and Tomas. She contemplates suicide at a canal bank; by chance, Tomas passes by Tereza and woos her back.\n\nStressed by city life, Tereza convinces Tomas to leave Prague for the country; they go to a village where an old patient of Tomas's welcomes them. In the village, they live an idyllic life, far from the political intrigues of Prague. In contrast, Sabina has gone to the US, where she continues her detached [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle. Later, Sabina is shocked by a letter that informs her Tereza and Tomas have been in a fatal automobile accident.\n\nThe movie ends with a short scene of Tomas and Tereza driving down the country road in the rain just before their accident, and Tomas peacefully expresses to Tereza how happy he is.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Tomas\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Tereza\n* [[Lena Olin]] as Sabina\n* [[Derek de Lint]] as Franz\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Ambassador\n* [[Pavel Landovsk\u00fd]] as Pavel\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Chief Surgeon\n* [[Tomasz Borkowy|Tomek Bork]] as Jiri\n* [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as Interior Ministry Official\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as The Engineer\n* [[Anne Lonnberg]] as Swiss Photographer\n* [[Leon Lissek]] as Bald Man in Bar\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was an American production with an American director, Philip Kaufman, but it features a largely European cast. It was filmed in France; in the scenes depicting the Soviet invasion, archival footage is combined with new material shot in [[Lyon]]. The scene in which Tomas has sex with a woman while cleaning windows was shot in the then unrestored [[H\u00f4tel de Beauvais]] in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]] of Paris (now the Administrative Appeal Court).\n\n==Adaptation==\nKundera served as an active consultant during the making of the film. Kundera wrote the poem that Tomas whispers into Tereza's ear as she is falling asleep specifically for the film.<ref name=\"DStar\">\n  \"Condemned by fate, persecuted by politics\",\n  ''[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]'', 2008-08-30, webpage:\n  [http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=52391 DStar-52391].</ref>\n\nHowever, in a note to the Czech edition of the book, Kundera remarks that the movie had very little to do with the spirit either of the novel or the characters in it.<ref>\"Nesnesiteln\u00e1 lehkost byt\u00ed\", \"Pozn\u00e1mka Autora\", p.&nbsp;341, dated 2006 France, published by Atlantis.</ref> In the same note Kundera goes on to say that after this experience he no longer allows any adaptations of his work. Many critics have focused on how much of the book was successfully captured, or could be captured, on film; however, some commentators, such as Cattrysse Patrick, have argued that the film must be viewed in a different light, with the book as only one source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Patrick|first=Cattrysse|title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being: Film Adaptation Seen From a Different Perspective|journal=Literature/Film Quarterly|date=1 January 1997|url=https://www.academia.edu/279971|access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film garnered high praise from critics. It holds an approval rating of 85% on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 27 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Exploring sexual mores against the backdrop of real-life social upheaval, ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' artfully blends the political and the erotic.\"<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unbearable_lightness_of_being/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] and [[Philip Kaufman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYWiXSdaZ3E Rain Man and Dangerous Liasions Win Writing Awards: 1989 Oscars-YouTube]</ref> and [[Sven Nykvist]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].

Home Entertainment|Warner Home Video]] as a 2-disc special edition on February 28, 2006.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|The Unbearable Lightness of Being (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe film makes extensive use of classical pieces by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] composer [[Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek]], especially his \"[[On an Overgrown Path]]\" piano compositions. It also features a performance of [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[Marta Kubi\u0161ov\u00e1]] in [[Czech language|Czech]] as well as the traditional Czechoslovakian [[Folk music|folk song]] \"Joj, Joj, Joj\", performed by [[Jarmila \u0160ul\u00e1kov\u00e1]] and Vojt\u011bch Jochec.\n\n==Preservation==\n''The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' was preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=https://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0096332|The Unbearable Lightness of Being}}\n* {{Mojo title|unbearablelightnessofbeing|The Unbearable Lightness of Being}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|unbearable_lightness_of_being}}\n*{{AFI film|id=59151|title=The Unbearable Lightness Of Being}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/63-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''] an essay by [[Michael Sragow]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=7557 Movie Stills] at Virtual History\n* [http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2275-insdorf-on-kaufman Excerpt about the film by film scholar Annette Insdorf] from her book, ''Philip Kaufman''\n\n{{Philip Kaufman}}\n{{Milan Kundera}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unbearable Lightness Of Being}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:Films with atheism-related themes]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Czech novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Philip Kaufman]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1968]]\n[[Category:Films set in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American political drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Prague]]\n[[Category:Films shot in France]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Saul Zaentz]]\n[[Category:Films critical of communism]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Adapted Screenplay BAFTA Award]]\n[[Category:Fiction about invasions]]\n[[Category:1980s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s political drama films]]\n[[Category:National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film winners]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
