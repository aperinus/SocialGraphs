The film was produced by [[Platinum Dunes]] and [[Crystal Lake Entertainment]] and distributed by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. It stars [[Jared Padalecki]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Aaron Yoo]], [[Amanda Righetti]], [[Travis Van Winkle]], and [[Derek Mears]] and follows Clay Miller (Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Righetti), who is captured by [[Jason Voorhees]] (Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake.\n\nThe film was originally conceived as an [[origin story]], but the project evolved into a [[Remake#Reimagine|re-imagining]] of the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for ''Part III''; though there were subtle changes. ''Friday the 13th'' includes some of [[Harry Manfredini]]'s musical score from the previous ''Friday the 13th'' films because the producers recognized its iconic status.<ref name=\"SG\">{{cite web|author=Ryan Stewart |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday+the+13th%3A+The+Producers/ |title=Friday the 13th: The Producers |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=November 28, 2008 |access-date=December 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504133108/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday%2Bthe%2B13th%3A%2BThe%2BProducers/ |archive-date=May 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Friday the 13th'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by [[New Line Cinema]] in North American territories and by [[Paramount Pictures]] internationally. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it did not add anything new to the franchise. The film would go on to gross $92.7 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise after ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. As of May 20, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 402 words. -->\nOn June 13, 1980, a young [[Jason Voorhees]] watches as his mother [[Pamela Voorhees|Pamela]] is beheaded by a camp counselor, who was trying to escape Mrs. Voorhees's murder spree around Camp Crystal Lake. Almost thirty years later, a group of friends{{mdash}} including [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Whitney Miller|Whitney Miller]] {{mdash}}arrive for a camping trip at Crystal Lake, where they hope to find a crop of [[marijuana]] growing in the woods. That night, an adult Jason kills everyone except Whitney, whom he captures as she resembles his mother at a young age.\n\nSix weeks later, Trent, his girlfriend Jenna and friends Chelsea, Bree, Chewie, Nolan, and Lawrence arrive at Trent's summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Whitney's brother [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Clay Miller|Clay Miller]] arrives at the lake to search for her, despite his local sherrif's pleas to look elsewhere. Clay visits Trent's cabin, and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney. Chelsea and Nolan go [[wakeboarding]] on the lake where Jason kills Nolan with an arrow, and fatally stabs Chelsea with a machete. Meanwhile, Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds, where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house.\n\nJenna and Clay run back to the cabin to warn the others about Jason. Chewie is killed by Jason in a tool shed near the cabin, while Trent and Bree have sex in a bedroom. Jenna and Clay arrive, and Clay calls the police. Jason then disconnects the cabin's electricity. Lawrence heads outside to search for Chewie, and Jason kills him with an axe. Jason then sneaks inside and kills Bree. A police officer arrives and knocks on the front door, but is killed by Jason before he can enter. Trent, Clay, and Jenna escape the cabin and become separated, and Trent is killed by Jason when he reaches the main road.\n\nJason chases Clay and Jenna back to the campgrounds, where Clay discovers Jason's lair and finds his sister underground, chained to a wall. Clay frees Whitney, and all three try to escape as Jason arrives. They find an exit, but Jenna is impaled by Jason's machete before she can escape. Jason corners Clay and Whitney in a barn, and Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela. Clay and Whitney subdue Jason with a length of chain, and Whitney stabs Jason in the chest with his own machete. After sunrise, Clay and Whitney dump Jason's body into the lake, but before they leave, Jason bursts through the [[Dock (maritime)#American English|wooden dock]] and grabs Whitney.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jared Padalecki]] as Clay Miller\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Jenna\n* [[Amanda Righetti]] as Whitney Miller\n* [[Derek Mears]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n** Caleb Guss as Young Jason Voorhees\n* [[Travis Van Winkle]] as Trent\n* [[Julianna Guill]] as Bree\n* [[Arlen Escarpeta]] as Lawrence\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Chewie\n* [[Willa Ford]] as Chelsea\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as Nolan\n* [[Kyle Davis (actor)|Kyle Davis]] as Donnie\n* [[Nick Mennell]] as Mike\n* [[America Olivo]] as Amanda\n* [[Ben Feldman]] as Richie\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Wade\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Sheriff Bracke\n* [[Nana Visitor]] as [[Pamela Voorhees]]\n** [[Kathleen Garrett]] as voice of Pamela Voorhees\t\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[New Line Cinema]]'s [[Toby Emmerich]] approached [[Platinum Dunes]] producers [[Michael Bay]], [[Brad Fuller (producer)|Brad Fuller]] and [[Andrew Form]] about remaking ''Friday the 13th'' in the same way they restarted [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]].

Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a \"cute line\" about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147 |title=Panabaker Describes Alternate Friday the 13th Kill|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=April 7, 2009|access-date=April 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409014120/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147|archive-date=April 9, 2009|url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in installments of the previous series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark ([[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]]) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of ''Friday the 13th''.<ref name=\"Shan/Swift\"/>\n\nThe writers altered Jason's character. Mears describes him as a combination of [[John Rambo]], [[Tarzan]], and the [[Abominable Snowman]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]''. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would \"demystify\" the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, \"We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple.\"<ref name=\"SG\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for ''Friday the 13th''. Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=1|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (1)|magazine=[[VFX World]]|date=February 16, 2009|access-date=February 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829060459/http://www.awn.com/articles/production/ifriday-13thi-compositing-kills-camp-crystal-lake|archive-date=August 29, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Richiesdeath.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with a video camera kneels to film as an actor pulls a machete from the head of another actor who is sitting on the ground.

Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete to show it being pulled away from Feldman's face.]]\nOne of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland  was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames.<ref name=\"VFX2\">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=2|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (2)|magazine=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|access-date=February 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813062158/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=2|archive-date=August 13, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a [[Powerboating|speedboat]]. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of [[Willa Ford]] reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\nAsylum also enhanced some of Jason's signature machete kills. In several scenes, the company used a computer-generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths. In one scene, Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head. Instead of using a real machete with a fake head, Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle{{mdash}}with only a portion of the blade attached{{mdash}}away from Feldman's head. Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect.<ref name=\"VFX2\"/> For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a \"post mortem\" look. The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason's machete.<ref name=\"VFX3\">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=3|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (3)|magazine=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|access-date=February 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813062351/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=3|archive-date=August 13, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAsylum digitally created weapons for various scenes. In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the air{{mdash}}in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor{{mdash}}would be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete [[3D computer graphics|3D model]] of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.<ref name=\"VFX3\"/>\n\n===Creating Jason===\n{{further|Jason Voorhees#Concept and creation}}\n[[File:Jason2009face.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A sculpture of a male torso and head is overlaid with fake skin, which has been molded to appear as lean muscle. The face is disfigured, the left side of the mouth is curled upwards as though snarling, the right eye droops and is pressed into the eye socket, and the top of the head is bald with strands of hair on the back. The skin is pale.|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Jason as seen in the film. Effects artist Scott Stoddard combined characteristics from Jason's appearance in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and ''The Final Chapter'' when crafting his design.]]\n\nEffects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton's design for ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and [[Tom Savini]]'s design for ''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter''. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had [[scoliosis]]. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/> He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|title=Fridaythe13thfilms.com Exclusive Interview with new Jason, Derek Mears!|author=Tony Carroll|publisher=Fridaythe13thfilms.com|date=January 31, 2009|access-date=March 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724030403/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|archive-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor Jason's wardrobe, Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a \"high-priced t-shirt\" that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his \"kill movements\", so the top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket to create what Mears called a \"giant [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] jacket.\" He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back.<ref name=\"DMint\"/> Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, \"Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There  were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up.\"<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n==Music==\nForm and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by [[Harry Manfredini]]. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they had [[Steve Jablonsky]] compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film.<ref name=\"SG\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Gilchrist|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|title=Set Visit: Friday the 13th (page 3)|website=IGN|date=October 30, 2008|access-date=February 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219064850/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score ''Friday the 13th'' after having worked with him on the remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''. Nispel told Jablonsky  he wanted him to create something that Nispel could \"whistle when [he] left the theater\", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, \"I don't believe that, when you watch a ''Friday the 13th'' film, you want to feel like [[John Williams]] is sitting next to you with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/1382-fridays-nispel-talks-hodder-and-manfredinis-absences-etc.html|title=Friday's Nispel talks Hodder and Manfredini's absences, etc.|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|date=February 13, 2009|access-date=March 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219213131/http://fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/1382-fridays-nispel-talks-hodder-and-manfredinis-absences-etc.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nA teaser trailer of the film debuted at the [[2008 Scream Awards]] held in October and was later released online.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Official Friday the 13th Teaser Hits!|work=[[MovieWeb]]|url=https://movieweb.com/the-official-friday-the-13th-teaser-hits/|access-date=June 6, 2018}}</ref> In December, the film's theatrical trailer was released along with the theatrical poster.<ref>{{cite news|title=Friday the 13th New Poster and Trailer Are Here!|work=MovieWeb|url=https://movieweb.com/friday-the-13th-new-poster-and-trailer-are-here/|access-date=June 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143652/https://movieweb.com/friday-the-13th-new-poster-and-trailer-are-here/|archive-date=June 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> On Friday, February 13, 2009,<ref name=\"release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/MCNewsDetailPage.aspx?catid=30&mid=14390|title=Young Jason Cast in Friday the 13th remake|publisher=FearNet|date=May 15, 2008|access-date=May 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219023637/http://www.fearnet.com/news/b10917_young_jason_cast_in_friday_13th_remake.html|archive-date=December 19, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Friday the 13th'' was released in 3,105 theaters in North America.<ref name=\"DBO\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&id=fridaythe13th09.htm|title=Daily Box Office Calendar|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=February 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218112951/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&id=fridaythe13th09.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The 2009 film was given the widest release of any ''Friday the 13th'' film, including the crossover film with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.
