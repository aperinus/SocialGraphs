The women fall into a large [[trapping pit|pit trap]] while George is caught by a [[Snare trap|snare]]. As he hangs helplessly, a masked [[poacher]] approaches and disembowels him with a knife.\n\nSome days prior to this, the European Sales division of Palisade Defence military arms corporation are on a bus to a team-building weekend at a lodge in the [[M\u00e1tra]] Mountains of [[Hungary]]. When a fallen tree blocking the road halts the bus's progress, the driver refuses to take a dirt road through the woods and, after an argument, drives off, leaving the group to walk the remaining distance to the lodge.\n\nThe lodge turns out to be old and in serious disrepair, but the manager, Richard, convinces them to enter. Inside, they discover a file cabinet full of cryptic Palisade documents, written in Russian. This leads Harris to relate a story he'd heard about the lodge: the lodge was previously a mental institution, and in the early 20th century a Palisade-made [[nerve gas]] was used to clear it out after the inmates took over. Jill responds with the story she'd heard: the lodge was a \"reeducation center\" for Russian war criminals and poachers, and after an escape a Palisade-made nerve gas was used to clear escapees out of nearby buildings. Both mention a lone survivor who swore revenge on Palisade. Steve starts to tell his own story about the lodge's past as a clinic staffed by busty nurses when he finds a human tooth in the meat pie the group is eating for dinner. Chastising Gordon for serving a pie he just found in the kitchen, everyone goes to bed.\n\nThat night Jill sees someone looking into the lodge from the trees. Though nobody is found outside, everyone but Richard agrees that they should leave the lodge. The next morning Richard grudgingly sends Harris and Jill to the top of the hill to call the bus driver back. Reaching the hill, the two find the bus abandoned and the driver dead in a nearby creek. Back at the lodge, Gordon steps into a [[animal trapping|bear trap]]. After several failed attempts by Steve and Billy to pry the trap open, Gordon's left leg is cut through completely under the knee. Harris and Jill arrive in the bus, load everyone in and head back for town. On the way, a [[spike strip]] is thrown in front of the bus, which causes it to crash. Harris is thrown clear of the bus in the crash, and is decapitated by a masked poacher with a [[machete]]. Jill is captured and tied to a tree, gagged, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. The rest discover Harris's body, prompting them to head back to the lodge for the night.\n\nGordon later gets captured. Discovering a newly opened door, the four head into the basement which leads to an underground prison. Through one door, they find the now-dead Gordon with the Palisade logo carved into his torso, and a poacher who fires a [[shotgun]] at them. They hide in a nearby cell, where Billy dies from a chest wound. Richard escapes out the back into the woods. While trying to kill the poacher, Maggie falls through the rickety floor. The poacher turns around and takes aim at Maggie, but Steve saves her by killing the attacker. Maggie takes the poacher\u2019s shotgun and shoots him in the head.\n\nBelieving they are safe, Maggie and Steve exit the lodge, but discover several more armed, Russian-speaking poachers, awaiting them outside. The two run into the woods and come across Richard, who has stepped on a Palisade-made [[land mine]] and cannot move without detonating it. Richard guides Maggie and Steve through the minefield. Meanwhile, the poachers use a fallen branch to pass over the minefield and torment Richard with insults and stones. Accepting his situation, Richard does his best to save the others and steps off the mine, killing himself as well as two of the poachers.\n\nSteve and Maggie come to another building, the ''real'' Palisade lodge. Inside, they find their boss George, who is partying with two escorts Steve ordered earlier. George brings out a prototype missile launcher and fires it at the approaching poachers, but the missile locks on to a passing commercial jet instead, destroying it. The five run into the woods, leading to the events shown in the beginning of the film.\n\nMaggie and Steve are left to fight the poachers with what they have at hand. At one point, Maggie breaks her leg, but is saved when one of the escorts, rescued by Steve, arrives and shoots their attacker. Steve, Maggie and the escorts make it to a rowboat, and as they paddle off to safety Steve jokingly quips, \"[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursome]]?\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Laura Harris]] as Maggie\n*[[Claudie Blakley]] as Jill\n*[[Toby Stephens]] as Harris\n*[[Andy Nyman]] as Gordon\n*[[Babou Ceesay]] as Billy\n*[[Tim McInnerny]] as Richard\n*[[Danny Dyer]] as Steve\n*David Gilliam as George\n*Juli Drajk\u00f3 as Olga\n*Judit Viktor as Nadia\n*S\u00e1ndor Boros as Coach Driver\n\n==Release==\n===Home video===\n''Severance'' was released in the United Kingdom on [[DVD]] by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] on 8 January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvd-subtitles.com/severance-d50129.html|title=Severance|work=DVD-Subtitles|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> In the United States it was released on DVD by [[Magnolia Pictures]] on 27 September 2007.
