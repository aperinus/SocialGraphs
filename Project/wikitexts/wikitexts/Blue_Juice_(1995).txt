It follows JC (Pertwee) as he attempts to reconcile his surfer lifestyle and loser friends with the pressure to grow up from his girlfriend (Jones). ''Blue Juice'' was set in [[Cornwall]], and released in 1995 by [[Film4 Productions|FilmFour]].\n\n==Plot==\nJC seems to have it all figured out. By day he runs a surf school, at night he lies down next to his beautiful girlfriend Chloe, his lifelong dream is to travel the world surfing. However, when old mates arrive from London unannounced it releases tensions which have long been simmering under the surface of JC and Chloe's seemingly perfect relationship. Chloe decides to buy the local surfer cafe and settle down, His friends, especially drug-dealer Dean are intent on causing mischief and sucking JC back into surfing a dangerous reef, which he had attempted before, seriously injuring his back. It turns out that Dean had a job as a journalist, and setting up JC was to get a story.\n\nTo keep his job, he had to get a big story, preferably with a life or death situation involved. JC refuses to surf the 'boneyard' which prompts Dean to try it himself as he had already arranged media coverage, and his boss had decided to watch. Dean fails to surf the reef, hitting his head when smashed under by a huge wave. JC then dives in to rescue Dean and in doing so, successfully surfs the 'boneyard' therefore saving Dean's life and job at the same time. However Dean's boss gets knocked out by the local guru for his highly offensive attitude and remarks.\n\nJC's friend Terry, having been given drugs by Dean, has radically rethought his life and buys JC's round the world tickets for him and his fianc\u00e9. JC then uses the money to buy a cafe for him and Chloe, deciding that his relationship with Chloe is more important than impressing his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Chloe\n* [[Sean Pertwee]] as J.C.\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Dean Raymond\n* [[Steven MacKintosh]] as Josh Tambini\n* [[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]] as Terry Colcott\n\n==Wardrobe and props==\nMany of the film's characters are dressed in clothing from the pressure group [[Surfers against Sewage]]. Many characters also wear the Australian surfwear label [[Mambo Graphics]] and [[Stussy]] hats. Wetsuits used in the film and in publicity shots were manufactured by the Cornish Surf brand Gul. Other surf brands seen throughout the film, in the form of stickers or clothing, include Body Glove and Quiksilver.\n\nSurfers Against Sewage stickers and posters are widely used throughout the film, visible in the Aqua Shack scenes and applied to the blue Bedford CF van driven by JC and Chloe for the surf school.\n\nPertwee used [[toup\u00e9e]] tape to hold a sock in place, in the scene where JC appears nude apart from a black sock. \"...I came up with this ingenious ploy - wrapping toup\u00e9e tape on my chap. You won't believe how difficult it is to remove...\"<ref>Empire Magazine, October 1995</ref> In a 1995 interview with ''[[FHM magazine|FHM]]'', Zeta-Jones recalled the filming of the sock scene; \"It was a  brown [[Marks & Spencer]] one, though. If it was a Stussy  one, or something like that, it might have been more interesting.\"<ref>FHM Magazine, 1995</ref>\n\nProfessional surfer [[Steve England]] was a body double for [[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]]'s character, Terry. To replicate Gunn's look and larger build he had to have his long hair cut and wear two wetsuits with towels packed around his stomach.<ref>Guardian Newspapers, Limited, 11 December 1994</ref>\n\nA reference is made in the film to the 1960s comic book character the [[Silver Surfer]]. On the way to find the rave, JC, Josh, Dean and Terry pass a man painted entirely in silver carrying a silver surfboard who waves at them. Terry, under the influence of drugs supplied by Dean, then copies this by painting himself silver.\n\nThere are a couple of errors in the story. Early on when the radio DJ says the cows will be coming in for milking it cuts to a herd of Hereford cattle blocking a road. Herefords are farmed for beef not milk. In the scene where Wigan Casino is discussed, the order given of Three before Eight records is wrong.\n\nThe red and yellow \u2018TASTY\u2019 surfboard that Ewan McGregor used in the film, was sold at a film memorabilia auction in 2001 at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, to raise money for children born with Aids in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/1203306.stm |title=ENTERTAINMENT &#124; Hollywood props to raise cash for Aids |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Supporting cast==\n''Blue Juice'' features an appearance from [[Jenny Agutter]] as a retired actress turned hotel proprietor Mary Fenton, who is famous for playing [[Guinevere]] in a fictional television show called \"Arthur's Knights\".\n\nThe film also features [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Edwin Starr]] as a soul singer named Ossie Sands. The songs featured were recorded by Starr for the film. Continuing the Northern Soul theme, an appearance is made by legendary soul and [[funk]] DJ [[Keb Darge]]. He can be seen wearing a yellow top, dancing in the soul [[disco]] at the village hall. In the recording studio scene, the sound engineer is played by [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]], whose largest role before Blue Juice was as Christopher Craig, the accomplice of Derek Bentley in the film [[Let Him Have It]].\n\n[[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] had a small part as Mike, a tabloid newspaper editor, who pays the Ewan McGregor character, Dean, for stories about record producer Josh.\n\nThe role of Shaper, played by [[Heathcote Williams]], was also offered to [[Nigel Terry]], best known for his portrayal of King Arthur in the 1981  John Boorman film, ''Excalibur''.\n\nMark Frost, who played Moose, appeared in the 2008 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Echo Beach (soap)|Echo Beach]]'', also set on the Cornwall coast and featuring aspects of [[surf culture]]. Also part of the surfing crew was Cornish girl Andreya Wharry, who features throughout the film but is most prominently seen in the cafe scene where Josh tries to pay for Junior's food with his credit card. After Blue Juice, Wharry featured as a contestant on the TV show ''[[Gladiators (1992 British TV series)|Gladiators]]'', became a world top 10 [[kite surfing|kite surfer]] and set the world distance record for kite surfing, traveling from Cornwall to [[Ireland]], in September 2005.<ref>[http://www.barefootmedia.co.uk/mediacentre/andreyawharry.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603022825/http://www.barefootmedia.co.uk/mediacentre/andreyawharry.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}</ref> Another surfer was played by Martin Dorey, author of The Campervan Cookbook and presenter of the BBC2 series One Man and His Campervan.\n\nChloe and JC's baby is played by Astrid Weguelin, the daughter of the film's make-up artist Kirstin Weguelin.\n\n==Filming locations==\nMost of the film is set in [[Cornwall]] and filmed there, many scenes are actually cut showing several different beaches and villages as if they were all adjoining, allowing the main parts of Cornwall to be incorporated into a single place.\nThe main location of the Aqua Shack is in [[Mousehole]] cut into St Ives, while other locations in Cornwall included a rock high above Chapel Porth for the mystical seaweed scene, [[Godrevy]], [[Newquay]] and [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] for some of the street scenes. The scene filmed at the train station was in St. Erth, just outside [[Hayle]]. The map examined by JC, Josh and Dean whilst trying to work out where Terry has gone on the bike shows Godrevey Point and the B3301 road, a few miles north of Hayle. The scene where JC and Chloe argue through the windscreen of the van have is at [[Trevellas]] Porth Valley, also known as Blue Hills, between [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St. Agnes]] and [[Perranporth]]. The location of the second Aqua Shack is Kynance Cove Cafe, at [[Kynance Cove]] on Lizard Point. The outside of the hotel where Josh and Dean take Terry for the cream tea is the [[Tregenna Castle]] Hotel, however the inside scenes were filmed at the [[Pendley Manor]] Hotel in Tring (Hertfordshire), whilst the village hall scene was filmed at Rose Hill, just off Bunkers Hill in the Downalong area of St Ives.\n\nThe large wave and surfing sequences were filmed in Famara, [[Lanzarote]], while a few close ups were filmed in a specialist wave pool, as shown in the documentary that accompanies the DVD release. Additional shots were filmed in [[London]] and at [[Pinewood Studios]]. In a 2008 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', Sean Pertwee stated that his favourite place in the [[British Isles]] was St. Agnes in Cornwall. \"I spent a lot of time there when filming ''Blue Juice'', which was about surfers. The walk along the top of the cliffs is beautiful.\"<ref>''The Independent'' (London), 12 January 2008</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"Movin' On Up\" performed by [[Edwin Starr]] (a cover of the [[Primal Scream]] song)\n* \"The Price of Pain\" - performed by Edwin Starr\n* \"Freedom Bug\" - performed by Heavy Stereo, written by [[Gem Archer]]\n* \"Get It On\" - performed by [[Marc Bolan]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T.

McGregor is depicted clean shaven and in a wetsuit, despite the fact his character in the film had a beard and long hair. Several reviewers and consumers picked up on this, including a review at www.dvdverdict.com which stated: \"While it is perfectly understandable to attempt to sell the disc to consumers, it is questionable whether or not this marketing push steps over the line into [[disinformation]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bluejuice.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - Blue Juice |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2000-03-24 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306001207/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bluejuice.php |archivedate=6 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA later release on DVD in 2004 reverted to the original artwork featuring Pertwee and \nZeta-Jones, while a further release in 2008 saw the artwork entirely redesigned with [[FilmFour]] branding and a fresh image of Pertwee and Zeta-Jones.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0112537}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|blue_juice}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:1995 drama films]]\n[[Category:Surfing films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
