As the characters' names suggest, ''Nadja'' is a [[vampire film]], but it treats genre elements in an understated [[arthouse]] style.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Filmink|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/peter-fonda-10-phases-acting/|title=Peter Fonda \u2013 10 Phases of Acting|date=October 26, 2019 }}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n\nCount Voivoide Arminius Chousescu Dracula dies with a stake in his heart, and his daughter Nadja (Elina L\u00f6wensohn) shows up to claim the body, hoping that his death will free her from the life her father has forced on her. She has the body cremated and prepares to take the ashes to Brooklyn and pay a visit to her twin brother Edgar whom she hasn't seen for a long time. Before she leaves, however, she stops for a drink and meets Lucy. Lucy is also feeling a sense of emptiness, so she takes Nadja home. They appear to cheer each other up, and they wind up having sex together.\n\nSo, who killed Dracula? Van Helsing (Peter Fonda), of course. And Helsing's nephew Jim, who also happens to be Lucy's husband, has to bail him out of jail. Helsing knows that, if Dracula's body is not destroyed properly, he'll be back. When Helsing learns that Dracula's body has been removed from the morgue, he enlists Jim's help.\n\nMeanwhile, Nadja goes to visit Edgar and meets his nurse and live-in lover Cassandra. Edgar is sick. Nadja persuades Cassandra to move Edgar to her apartment where she can help him by transfusing him with plasma from the blood of shark embryos , which is what Nadja uses to stay healthy. Edgar revives enough to drink some of Nadja's blood. However, Lucy has fallen under Nadja's mesmerism. She leads both Jim and Van Helsing to Edgar's house where Nadja is staying with her Renfield. Edgar awakens long enough to warn Cassandra to leave the house, as she is in danger. Cassandra, who just happens to be Van Helsing's daughter, attempts to escape, with Nadja pursuing her, Lucy pursuing Nadja, and Jim pursuing Lucy. Cassandra runs into a gas station where it looks like two burly mechanics are going to protect her, but Nadja mesmerizes them and kills one of them. A policeman enters the gas station and shoots Nadja in the abdomen.\n\nEdgar is improving. He unites with the Helsings to stop Nadja. He receives a \"psychic fax\" from Nadja, telling him that she is injured and must return to Transylvania. She also mentions that she's taking Cassandra with her, so Edgar and the Helsings high-tail it to Transylvania, too. As they approach the castle, Nadja begins a transfusion of Cassandra's blood while Cassandra sleeps. While Jim fights with Nadja's Renfield, Edgar and Helsing drive a stake through Nadja's heart. Lucy is released, Nadja is destroyed, and Cassandra wakes up. However, not all is as it seems. Nadja narrates the epilogue: \"They cut off my head...burned my body...no one knew...no one suspected that I was now alive in Cassandra's body. Edgar and I were married at City Hall...there *is* a better way to live.\"\n\n==Style==\n\nThe [[deadpan]] acting, episodic nature of the plot, and the presence of [[Martin Donovan]] and L\u00f6wensohn are suggestive of a [[Hal Hartley]] film though he was not involved in the production. The ''[[Chicago Review]]'' called it \"Hal Hartley meets [[David Lynch]]\".  Lynch himself cameos and executive produces.\n\nThe film is shot in [[black and white]] by [[Jim Denault]] mostly at night in [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]], including use of the [[PXL-2000]], and is underscored by a dreamlike score/soundscape by [[Simon Fisher Turner]] as well as the songs \"Soon\" and \"Lose My Breath\" by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and \"Strangers\" and \"Roads\" by [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as Nadja\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]\n* [[Suzy Amis]] as Cassandra\n* [[Galaxy Craze]] as Lucy\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Jim\n* [[Karl Geary]] as [[Renfield]]\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Edgar\n* [[David Lynch]] (also [[Executive producer]]) as [[morgue]] attendant (cameo)\n\n==Reception== \nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Nadja'' holds an approval rating of 64% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critics' consensus reads: \"''Nadja'' approaches the Dracula legend from an idiosyncratic angle - and with just enough visual style to overcome uneven storytelling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/nadja|title=Nadja (1995)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half out of four stars, characterizing it as \"an example of a genre we can call Deadpan Noir. It's the kind of movie that deals with unspeakable subjects while keeping a certain ironic distance, and using dialogue that seems funny, although the characters never seem in on the joke.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/nadja-1995|title=Nadja movie review & film summary (1995)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=September 1, 1995|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|access-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0110620|title=Nadja}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|nadja}}\n* {{Mojo title|nadja}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n{{Michael Almereyda}}\n{{Dracula}}\n\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:Camcorder films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampires]]\n[[Category:1994 horror films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
