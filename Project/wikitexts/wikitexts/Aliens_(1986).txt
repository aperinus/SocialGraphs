It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and the second film in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]. The film is set in the far future; [[Sigourney Weaver]] stars as [[Ellen Ripley]], the sole survivor of an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|alien]] attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. [[Michael Biehn]], [[Paul Reiser]], [[Lance Henriksen]], and Carrie Henn feature in supporting roles.\n\nDespite the success of ''Alien'', its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from [[20th Century Fox]], and repeated changes in management. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for ''Aliens'' in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5{{nbsp}}million budget, ''Aliens'' began [[principal photography]] in September 1985. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The difficult shoot affected the composer, [[James Horner]], who was given little time to record the music.\n\n''Aliens'' was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise; other members of the cast were positively received, including [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Jenette Goldstein]], who played Colonial Marines. The film received several awards and nominations, including an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. ''Aliens'' earned $131.1\u2013183.3{{nbsp}}million during its theatrical run, one of the [[1986 in film|highest-grossing films of 1986]] worldwide.\n\n''Aliens'' is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to (or better than) ''Alien''. The film is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. ''Aliens'' inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books, and toys. The film was followed by two sequels{{snd}}''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992) and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), neither of which were as successful, and the prequels ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) and ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per Wikipedia Guidelines, please do not expand this summary any further.-->\n[[Ellen Ripley]] has been in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] for 57 years aboard an escape shuttle after destroying her ship, the ''Nostromo'', to escape an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|alien creature]] that slaughtered her crew. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the [[exomoon]] LV-426,{{efn|The [[exomoon]] known as LV-426 is also referred to as Acheron.<ref name=\"SyFyNewt\"/>}} since it is now the site of a [[terraforming]] colony. After contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship ''[[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|Sulaco]]'' but is distrustful of their [[android (robot)|android]], [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]], due to the [[Ash (Alien)|android aboard the ''Nostromo'']] having betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.\n\nA [[Shuttlecraft|dropship]] delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|alien facehugger]]s in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists except for a traumatized young girl, nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the [[fusion power|fusion-power]]ed atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an [[chestburster|infant alien]] after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their [[armored personnel carrier]], and rams the nest to rescue Corporal [[Dwayne Hicks]] and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots and it crashes into the station. Almost out of ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.\n\nRipley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for [[biological weapon]] research. Before she can expose him, Bishop informs the group that the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system and the plant will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. He volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the ''Sulaco''{{'}}s remaining dropship to the surface.\n\nAfter falling asleep in the medical laboratory, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos, allowing him to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley brings Hicks to Bishop in the second dropship, but she refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen surrounded by dozens of eggs, and when one begins to open, Ripley uses her weapons to destroy them all and the queen's [[ovipositor]]. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt join Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.\n\nAboard the ''Sulaco'', the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the dropship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley fights the creature with an [[Powered exoskeleton|exosuit]] cargo loader and expels it through an [[airlock]] into space while the damaged Bishop keeps Newt safe. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters|l1=''List of ''Alien ''film series characters''}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=750\n |footer =  (Left to right) [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Michael Biehn]] (both pictured in 2016), [[Paul Reiser]] (2010), [[Lance Henriksen]] (2011), and Carrie Henn (2016)\n | image1 = Sigourney Weaver (28620762255) cropped 2.jpg\n | alt1 = A photograph of Sigourney Weaver\n | image2 = Michael Biehn (28620701225) cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = A photograph of Michael Biehn\n | image3 = Paul Reiser (28004453143) cropped.jpg\n | alt3 = A photograph of Paul Reiser\n | image4 = Lance Henriksen cropped.jpg\n | alt4 = A photograph of Lance Henriksen\n | image5 = Carrie Henn (28513889272) cropped.jpg\n | alt5 = A photograph of Carrie Henn\n}}\n<!-- For information on editing, see the \"Cast and crew information\" section of MOS:FILM. -->\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]]: The sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship, the ''Nostromo''<ref name=\"NYTimes1986July18\"/>\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as Dwayne Hicks: A corporal in the Colonial Marines<ref name=\"RemarEmpire\"/>\n* [[Paul Reiser]] as Carter J.

Using [[Hollywood accounting]] methods, Fox had declared ''Alien'' a financial loss despite its earnings of over $100{{nbsp}}million against a $9\u2013$11{{nbsp}}million budget. Brandywine's lawsuit was settled by early 1983, the result being that Fox would finance the development of ''Alien{{nbsp}}II'', but was not required to distribute the film.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/><ref name=\"PopMattesAccounting\"/>\n\nLevy's eventual replacement, [[Joe Wizan]], was receptive to a sequel, and although other executives remained noncommittal, Giler's development executive, Larry Wilson, began looking for a scriptwriter by mid-1983.<ref name=\"BloodyDisgustingRetro\"/><ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/> Wilson came across the script for the in-development science fiction film, ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), written by [[James Cameron]].

With few projects in development, Gordon looked at sequels to Fox's existing properties and came across the ''Alien{{nbsp}}II'' treatment; he said he was surprised no one had pursued it.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/> Production of ''The Terminator'' was delayed for nine months because [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was contractually obligated to film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984).

He and Hurd agreed to combine the horror of ''Alien'' with the action of ''The Terminator''. According to Hill, Cameron said if the first film could be compared to a [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attraction]], ''Aliens'' should be like a [[roller coaster]].<ref name=\"LATimesJuly1119886\"/> Cameron believed in having a strong female heroine to distinguish his films from typical Hollywood action fare and wrote the script with a picture of Weaver on his desk.<ref name=\"IGNMakingOf\"/> He referred to ''The Terminator'', and how he removed the normal protective forces from [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] so she had to fend for herself.<ref name=\"NYTimes1985July9\"/> Cameron had also always wanted to make a film about space [[infantry]].<ref name=\"LATimesJuly1119886\"/>\n\nThe final script was well received, but Fox executives (including chairman [[Barry Diller]]) were concerned about the budget. Fox estimated the cost as close to $35{{nbsp}}million, but Hurd said it would be closer to $15.5{{nbsp}}million. Diller offered $12{{nbsp}}million, prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit. Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented, and Cameron and Hurd returned.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/> In April 1985, conflict turned to the cast; Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/><ref name=\"IGNMakingOf\"/> Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star; Fox refused, saying they would damage the studio's negotiating power with Weaver's agent.

The situation was difficult because the number of films simultaneously in production meant the crew could not be easily replaced. Cameron and Hurd gathered the crew to discuss their grievances; Cameron explained the importance of the production, and that any member of the crew who could not support it should volunteer to be replaced. The crew agreed to support Cameron if he supported their scheduled working hours.<ref name=\"ScreenRantMutiny\"/> The relationship between filmmakers and crew remained cool; when filming concluded at Pinewood, Cameron told the crew: \"This has been a long and difficult shoot, fraught by many problems{{nbsp}}... but the one thing that kept me going, through it all, was the certain knowledge that one day I would drive out the gate of Pinewood and never come back, and that you sorry bastards would still be here\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantMutiny\"/> He described most of the crew as \"lazy, insolent, and arrogant\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantMutiny\"/> Paxton called the crew's work impeccable, but their attitude more relaxed than the American crews to which he was accustomed.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/>\n\nThe alien nest was filmed in the decommissioned [[Acton Lane Power Station]] in London, and the set was left in place until the filming of the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989)|Batman]]''.<ref name=\"Sideshow\"/><ref name=\"Movie Minutiae: Aliens\"/> While filming the dropship descent from the ''Sulaco'', shaking collapsed the set roof onto the cast and crew.

One of his signature lines, \"Game over man, game over\", originated from Paxton developing a backstory for Hudson in which he was trained on simulators.<ref name=\"YahooPaxton\"/> Henn found it hard to act afraid of the aliens (since she was fond of the actors in the suits) and imagined a dog was chasing her.<ref name=\"PeopleHenn\"/> Other cast members spent time with Henn between scenes, including Weaver and Paxton (who would color or craft things with her).<ref name=\"PeopleHenn\"/><ref name=\"DailyBeastPaxton\"/> Biehn said he and Paxton spent much of their free time together.<ref name=\"RemarEmpire\"/> Despite the difficulties, Fox was satisfied with the [[Dailies|daily footage]], and principal photography concluded in January 1986, on time and on budget.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/>{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=51}}\n\n===Post-production===\nPost-production began in late April 1986.<ref name=\"latimesJuly241986\"/> Several scenes were removed from ''Aliens''{{'}} theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter's death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death.<ref name=\"ScreenRantDeleted2\"/> Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt's family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantDeleted1\"/>\n\n[[Ray Lovejoy]] was responsible for editing the final two hours, 17 minutes cut of ''Aliens''.<ref name=\"VarietyLovejoy\"/> Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters, increasing its revenue potential.

Cameron first heard the score while it was being recorded by the orchestra and did not like it, but it was too late to make changes. [[Brad Fiedel]]'s synth-inspired tracks for ''The Terminator'' had allowed changes to be made quickly based on feedback, but Cameron had no experience managing orchestral music.<ref name=\"HornerVulture\"/> Cameron cut the score up, using pieces where he believed they fit best, and inserted pieces of [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''Alien'' score and hired unknown composers to fill gaps.<ref name=\"HornerVulture\"/><ref name=\"FilmTracks\"/> The director said in a later interview he thought the score was good, but did not fit the scenes he had filmed.<ref name=\"HornerVulture\"/> Horner's \"alien [[Sting (musical phrase)|sting]]\" sound was initially only used once, during the scene with the cocooned woman, as Cameron disliked it, but he eventually used it throughout the film.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/> Unused portions of Horner's ''Aliens'' score were repurposed for ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988).<ref name=\"LATimesDieHardScore\"/><ref name=\"FilmScoreDieHard\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Special effects and design==\nDevelopment of the special effects for ''Aliens'' began in May 1985, with [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]] supervising a 40-person team at [[Stan Winston Studio]].<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"StanWinstonTheQueen\"/>{{sfn|Shay|1986|pp=8,11}} L.A. Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects. Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=11}} He also did not rehire many ''Alien'' crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film. Those who returned were often given a higher status (such as [[Crispian Sallis]], ''Alien'' [[focus puller]] and ''Aliens'' set decorator).{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=9}}{{sfn|Pirani|1986|pp=11\u201312}} Cameron had enjoyed returning artist [[Ron Cobb]]'s work on ''Alien'',{{sfn|Pirani|1986|p=12}} and conceptual artist [[Syd Mead]] was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'' (1984).<ref name=\"VultureMead\"/>\n\n===Sets and technology===\nMead designed the ''Sulaco'', the marines' spaceship. He conceived it as a large sphere with antennae, but Cameron wanted it to be flatter; the full craft had to pass the camera, and a sphere would not work with the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/> Mead designed the craft as a commercial freighter carrying a military unit. Its exterior was designed with a row of loading doors, a crane, and large gun fixtures to defend against threats.<ref name=\"SydMeadSulaco\"/> Mirrors were used as a cost-cutting measure to increase the number of sleeping pods and add a power loader.<ref name=\"DOGDanielKash\"/> Cobb designed the dropship, the armored personnel carrier (APC), and exteriors of the colony and its vehicles.<ref name=\"GuardianCobb\"/><ref name=\"Cobb1\"/><ref name=\"Cobb2\"/> The ''Sulaco''{{'}}s dropship was designed to be life-size, for use on the ''Sulaco'' set,<ref name=\"VultureMead\"/> but a smaller replica was used for some shots.<ref name=\"SydMeadSulaco\"/> The APC was a disguised [[pushback]] tug for a [[Boeing 747]].<ref name=\"SydMeadSulaco\"/> The derelict alien spacecraft used in ''Aliens'' had been in historian [[Bob Burns III]]'s driveway since its appearance in ''Alien''.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/>\n\nMost of the colony, apart from the main entrance used by the marines, was constructed in [[Scale model|scale miniature]] form. The set was about {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} long to accommodate the sixth-scale APC replica. The set was so large it had to be laid out diagonally across the stage, and [[forced perspective]] was used to add in buildings that would otherwise not fit.{{sfn|Shay|1986|pp=11,14}} Cobb used a stylized design for the colony, resembling a [[American frontier|western frontier]] town. It featured a makeshift construction from cargo containers, broken filming equipment, and beer crates.{{sfn|Shay|1986|pp=12,14}} The alien nest scene was one of the earliest filmed; Weaver's participation was delayed by three weeks because of production issues on her previous film ''[[Half Moon Street (film)|Half Moon Street]]'' (1986), and the scene was one of the few not involving her. The Acton Power Station location was filled with decaying [[asbestos]] and three weeks were spent having it professionally cleaned, during which time the alien hive was fabricated in clay spawning hundreds of fiberglass and vacuum-formed castings that were installed at the station over a further three weeks.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=15}} Cameron wanted to [[Panning (camera)|vertically pan]] as the marines enter the hive, but disguising the area above the marines would be time-intensive. A hanging miniature was made about {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} square from plywood and styrofoam hung just above the actors' heads and carefully blended into the larger set. After Remar was replaced, Cameron wanted to reshoot the scene but the miniature had been destroyed; Cameron was able to edit the scene to conceal Remar.{{sfn|Shay|1986|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe marines' smart guns weighed {{convert|65|to|70|lb}}, and were constructed from German [[MG 42]] machine guns attached to a [[steadicam]] and augmented with motorcycle parts.{{sfn|Lowry|1987|p=41}}<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> Since getting in and out of the smart-gun rig was difficult, the actors kept them on when not filming.<ref name=\"EmpireCastPage3\"/> The pulse rifle was made from a [[Thompson submachine gun]] and a [[Franchi SPAS-12]] pump-action shotgun in a futuristic shell.<ref name=\"LATimesWeaverRambolina\"/> Weaver was opposed to weapons in general, but Cameron explained weapons were secondary to the core narrative of Ripley bonding with and protecting Newt.<ref name=\"IGNMakingOf\"/><ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"LATimesWeaverRambolina\"/> Weaver found using the weapons strange and difficult, due to their weight and her concern about pulling the wrong trigger.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"LATimesWeaverRambolina\"/> Automated [[sentry gun]]s were also constructed for ''Aliens'', although they do not appear in the theatrical cut. Real machine guns were positioned atop remote-controlled hydraulic tripods that allowed them to pivot horizontally or vertically. The guns were capable of firing up to 600 wooden-blank rounds per minute that would be shattered into small splinters by [[Silencer (firearms)#Baffles and spacers|baffles in the muzzle]] and incinerated by the heat generated in the barrel.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=19}}\n\nA cast was made of Henn's upper body and her stunt double's legs to construct a lightweight dummy for Weaver to hold when carrying a gun; Henn's weight plus a gun would have been too heavy.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/> Goldstein had never handled a gun, and held her weapon incorrectly in closeups, so Hurd stood in for her.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/> The flamethrowers were functional. The art department had covered the sets in an unspecified substance to artificially age them; the flamethrowers vaporized it, causing fire and heavy smoke. Goldstein struggled to breathe and, since improvisation was encouraged, Paxton thought she was acting until he also became breathless.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/>{{sfn|Drennan|1988|p=26}}\n\nThe nuclear explosion of the colony in the finale was created by shining a light bulb through cotton.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/> [[Reebok]] designer Taun Le was commissioned to design custom sneakers for Weaver to wear in the film. The only mandate was that the sneakers be laceless so that one could easily slide off Weaver's foot during the finale.<ref name=\"EmpireCast\"/><ref name=\"Reebok\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Creature effects===\n{{see also|Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|l1=Alien creature}}\n\n[[H. R. Giger]], who designed the ''Alien'' creature, was reportedly disappointed that he could not be involved in ''Aliens''.<ref name=\"SyFyMakingOfBook\"/> According to Hurd, Giger was contractually obligated to ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' (1986) and Fox was not allowed to negotiate with him.{{sfn|Pirani|1986|p=11}} Giger was replaced by special-effects creator [[Stan Winston]]. Cameron also contributed to designs, but was not as concerned with the warrior aliens because they were on screen only briefly.<ref name=\"SyFyMakingOfBook\"/> In redesigning the alien warriors, Cameron remained faithful to Giger's work while building on it. Conscious that the creatures would be seen by audiences as people in costumes, he enhanced the designs by extending their arms and often filmed them hung from wires or from atypical positions to make them appear more inhuman.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=9}} The aliens were played by dancers and stuntmen in lightweight costumes that allowed them to move quickly. Several {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} mannequins were used for aliens that were contorted into inhuman poses.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/> Although it appears hordes of alien creatures are in the film, there were only 12 alien suits: simple, black leotards covered in molded foam for faster-moving shots, and [[Theatrical property#Hero props|detailed models]] with articulated upper bodies and mouths for closeups.<ref name=\"StanWinstonAlienWarriors\"/> When the aliens were shot and destroyed, puppets were hung up and detonated. The aliens' acidic blood was a combination of [[titanium tetrachloride]], [[cyclohexylamine]], [[acetic acid]], and yellow dye.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/>\n\nThe facehugger design remained faithful to the original ''Alien'' design, but the overall appearance was made to appear more organic, and its eight legs were made more finger-like, enhancing the detail on the knuckles and adding fingernails.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=28}} Unlike in ''Alien'', which only involved one substantial jumping scene, the facehugger models used in ''Aliens'' featured full articulation for their tongue, legs, and tail, allowing for more action set pieces. The tail was also lengthened about {{cvt|6|in|cm}} to give it more functions such as a whip-like action.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=28}} Nine operators were required to operate the fully articulated facehugger, and other less-detailed variants were used for simple actions such as scurrying across the floor. The design team struggled with making it believably scuttle while moving the appendages, eventually developing a control wire along the floor that activated a gear inside the facehugger, causing the appendages to move as it was pulled along. Several rubber facehuggers were made to be thrown or blown up.{{sfn|Shay|1986|pp=28\u201329}} Manipulating the facehugger inside a water tank was also difficult as the tank had to be watertight and limited the use of control cables. A method was developed that used fewer cables to move the facehugger around the tank; the tail was fitted with a spring that caused it to snap back and forth.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=28}} Winston added arms to the chestburster alien form (since the adult form had arms), explaining how it could drag itself out of a host's chest. Two chestburster puppets were used: a reinforced one, and an articulated one for movement. A puppeteer punched the former through a fabricated latex-foam chest; the scene took several takes to film because it could not pierce the clothing.<ref name=\"StanWinstonColes\"/><ref name=\"StanWinston\"/>\n\nA deleted scene in ''Alien'' established a life cycle for the alien creatures in which a lifeform would be cocooned and transformed into an egg that would birth a facehugger.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=9}}<ref name=\"IGNEgg\"/> Inspired by a [[beehive]]-like hierarchy, Cameron believed the vast field of eggs on the derelict alien craft would come from a much larger creature, the queen, with the other alien creatures serving as her drones.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=9}} Winston described Cameron's initial queen design as a combination of a [[praying mantis]] and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' influenced by the alien warrior design.<ref name=\"SyFyMakingOfBook\"/>{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=40}} Cameron said [[dinosaur]] influences were unintentional as he considered them \"boring,\" and his goal was to extrapolate on Giger's warrior designs to create a large and powerful creature that was also swift and overtly female, describing it as \"hideous and beautiful at the same time, like a black widow spider\". The queen has elongated, large forelimbs, with smaller secondary ones underneath, but Winston redesigned the legs by adding a double joint to make it more inhuman.{{sfn|Shay|1986|p=40}} Cameron and Winston worked on several concepts to vivify the queen, including large puppets, miniatures, and costumes with several people inside. A frame was built large enough to hold two people, covered in black polythene bags, and hung on a crane. The prototype was a success, and Cameron wrote the alien-queen scene.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/><ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> The final alien queen was a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} puppet made of lightweight polyurethane foam.<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> Two people sat inside to control the arms; the legs were controlled by rods connected at the ankles, and a separate person whipped the tail around with fishing line. The head was manipulated with a combination of [[servomotor]]s and hydraulics controlled by up to four people. The effect was hidden by lighting, steam, slime, and smoke.<ref name=\"FSR36Things\"/><ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> The Stan Winston Studio had not used hydraulics before and considered them a learning experience. They were essential for moving larger parts of the queen puppet, including the head, and a foot press in the body could hydraulically move the tail up and down.<ref name=\"StanWinstonTheQueen\"/> [[Shane Mahan]] took several weeks to sculpt the head by sight based on a [[maquette]]; computer technology to scale up the model's design did not yet exist.<ref name=\"StanWinstonQueenHead\"/> Two heads were built: a lightweight, fragile one, and another that could survive some damage. Each was articulated with hydraulics and cables to control the queen's mouth and lips.<ref name=\"StanWinstonTheQueen\"/>\n\nTo create the effect of the queen piercing Bishop's chest with her tail, [[Tom Woodruff Jr.]] and Alec Gillis constructed a [[Breastplate|chestplate]] for Henriksen with a rubber segment of the queen's tail flattened against it. The tail was pulled forward by wire, apparently exploding through Bishop's torso. A rigid piece of tail (attached to a body harness) was used to show more of the tail moving through Bishop, and Henriksen was levered upward as if he was being lifted by the tail. To complete the effect, a dummy of Bishop was constructed with a spring-loaded mechanism that would forcibly separate his upper and lower body, as if the queen had ripped him in half. Once separated, Henriksen's upper body was below the set and a fake torso attached up to his shoulders. The android blood was milk, and after several days of filming, it was sour and foul-smelling.<ref name=\"StanWinstonQueenBishop\"/>\n\nJohn Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit, with input from Mead. As with the queen, a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"VultureMead\"/><ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees, in a black skinsuit, operated it from behind.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> The battle between the queen and power loader was extensively choreographed, as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large, unwieldy animatronic.<ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> The camera was sometimes moved to simulate subjects moving faster. The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots; the wires and rods had to be concealed, since they could not be removed in post-production.<ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/> Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with [[go motion]], a version of [[stop motion]] with [[motion blur]] added.<ref name=\"EWPowerLoader\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Context===\n{{see also|1986 in film}}\n[[File:Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Cameron and Hurd holding a theatrical poster for ''Aliens'' in 1986]]\nThe 1986 summer film season began in mid-May.

A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis, helping explain Ripley's motherly attention for Newt. Newt has also lost everything of value, and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones.<ref name=\"TimeSchickelPage5\"/><ref name=\"BloodyDisgustingThemes\"/> This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen, mother of the alien creatures.<ref name=\"BloodyDisgustingThemes\"/><ref name=\"DOGThemes\"/> There are no paternal figures; both are single mothers, defending their young. The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley, who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction.<ref name=\"TimeSchickelPage1\"/><ref name=\"BloodyDisgustingThemes\"/> According to Richard Schickel, ''Alien'' is about survival; ''Aliens'' is about fighting to ensure someone else's survival.<ref name=\"TimeSchickelPage5\"/>\n\nAuthors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt's capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her, demonstrating a selfless motherhood, unlike the queen's selfish motherhood.{{sfn|Ostrander|Yunis|2003|p=73}} Writing for the ''Los Angeles Times'', Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother, she saw in ''Aliens'' the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators, sexism, and threats to childhood innocence.<ref name=\"LATimesWebber\"/> Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood, the nuclear family is represented in ''Aliens'' with a mother (Ripley), father (Hicks), daughter (Newt), and a loyal, self-sacrificing dog (Bishop).{{sfn|Nishime|2005|p=39}}\n\nAccording to Charles Berg, the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the 1980s represented American fears of immigrants (the \"other\"). In ''Aliens'', this can be seen in the white-skinned single mother (Ripley) confronting the dark-skinned alien queen with an endless brood.{{sfn|Asc\u00e1rate|2004|p=57}} Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding, dwindling resources, and pollution, suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive. She represents mindless, unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children, regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival. Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding, the queen continues to reproduce.{{sfn|Ostrander|Yunis|2003|p=69}} The aliens' life cycle taints the reproductive cycle. Creation involves rape, and birth involves a violent death.{{sfn|Ostrander|Yunis|2003|p=70}} In destroying the aliens and their queen, Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own.{{sfn|Ostrander|Yunis|2003|p=72}}\n\n===Masculine femininity===\n[[File:John Rambo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, holding a gun|Ripley was often compared to the era's masculine heroes, including [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s [[John Rambo]].]]\nRipley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette, Rambette, Fembo, Ramboline; Weaver called herself Rambolina.<ref name=\"ABCNews30Things\"/><ref name=\"NYTimes1987May03\"/>{{sfn|Brown|1996|pp=8, 58}} [[Mary Lee Settle]] said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences. A gun, which can be seen as a [[Phallus|phallic]] symbol, has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver.<ref name=\"NYTimes1987May03\"/> Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender, where females serve the male hero. In ''Aliens'', the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone.<ref name=\"TimeSchickelPage3\"/> Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves. He called the overuse of male heroes \"commercially shortsighted\" in an industry whose audience is 50-percent female, and where \"80 percent of the time, it's women who decide which film to see\".<ref name=\"TimeSchickelPage3\"/><ref name=\"NYTimes1985July9\"/>\n\nThe growth of female-led action films after the success of ''Aliens'' reflects the change in women's roles and the divide between professional critics (who perceive a masculinization of the heroine) and audiences that\u2014regardless of gender\u2014embrace, emulate, and quote Ripley.{{sfn|Brown|1996|pp=52,69}} The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and Cameron's ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991).{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=52}} These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine \"soft\" bodies.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=60}} When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in ''Aliens'', the traditional male hero (Hicks) instructs her in the use of their weapons.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=61}} The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male, musclebound, gun-wielding action hero.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=8}} To balance her masculine traits, Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts; this counters homophobic audiences, who might see a masculinized female as [[Butch and femme|lesbian or butch]].{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=62}} These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez, a minor character. Vasquez (who has short hair and bigger muscles) is introduced to the audience by working out, and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man.{{sfn|Brown|1996|pp=62\u201363}} Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films, contrasting ''Alien''{{'s}} hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez (who sacrifices herself for her team, not only for the protagonist).<ref name=\"LATimesWebber\"/>\n\n===War and trauma===\n''Aliens'' has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War; the marines (like the United States) have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen, local enemy.<ref name=\"NYTimes1985July9\"/><ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> Like some Vietnam veterans, Ripley developed [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after the events of ''Alien''.{{sfn|Gallardo|Smith|2004|p=81}} Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in ''Aliens'' to the 1954 science-fiction film ''[[Them!]]'' In both films, humans are beset by a monstrous invasion; in ''Them!'', the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation. Abbott said its post-[[World War II]] American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands (and receives) the compliance of its citizens. The image of the post-Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized; in ''Aliens'', it is ill-equipped, bumbling, and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures. Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected, and it is Ripley, an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures, who saves the day.{{sfn|Abbott|1994|pp=23\u201325}} Unlike ''Them!'', the military is not at fault for creating the problem in ''Aliens''; it is the Weyland-Yutani corporation. The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation, which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of [[corporatism]]; the company is represented by Burke, a self-interested opportunist.{{sfn|Abbott|1994|p=24}} Ripley is elevated throughout ''Aliens'' as she benefits the community, and Burke works to undermine it for the company.{{sfn|Abbott|1994|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nAccording to Weaver, ''Aliens'' is about confronting trauma to obtain closure.<ref name=\"DOGTrauma\"/> This may be seen as a reflection of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s United States presidency and a [[conservatism]] that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side.{{sfn|Palmer|2006|p=386}}{{sfn|Gallardo|Smith|2004|p=82}} Comparing ''Alien'' with ''Aliens'', [[Roger Luckhurst]] said: \"Even if ''Alien'' was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of [its] myth could be inflected the other way. [Cameron's] ''Aliens'' would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story\u2014pumped, militarized, libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family.\"{{sfn|Luckhurst|2014|p=46}} Abbott said ''Aliens'' adheres to a [[radical politics|radical]] ideology and condemns [[centrism]]; similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social ''status quo''.{{sfn|Abbott|1994|pp=23\u201325}} The film places power in the individual (Ripley), instead of institutions like the military, corporations, or the government.{{sfn|Abbott|1994|p=26}} The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash (portrayed by [[Ian Holm]]) in ''Alien''. Unlike Ash, Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures. ''Aliens'' imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission. Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid, Bishop affirms, \"Believe me, I'd prefer not to, I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.\"<ref name=\"DOGBishopTrust\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Cultural influence===\nA cinematic [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]], ''Aliens'' has had an enduring influence on filmmaking.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"AVClub2016\"/><ref name=\"DeadlineInfluence\"/><ref name=\"IndieWireLegacy\"/><ref name=\"LATimesReunion\"/>}} Elements such as a team of soldiers being dismantled by a villain have been repeated to the point of clich\u00e9.<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> The same is true of Horner's oft-imitated score,<ref name=\"DOGHornerCliche\"/><ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> which regularly appeared in action-film trailers for the following decade.<ref name=\"HornerEW\"/><ref name=\"HornerVulture\"/> The film's influence can also be seen in video games' (particularly science-fiction games') ships, armor, and weapons,<ref name=\"DOGVideoGameInfluences\"/>{{sfn|Jenkins|Weise|2009|p=111}} as well as the 1989 Italian film ''[[Shocking Dark]]'', a remake of ''Aliens'' that relocates much of the plot and scenes to a [[Venice|Venetian]] setting and incorporates elements of ''The Terminator''; outside Italy, it was released as ''Terminator II''.<ref name=\"DOGItalianRemake\"/>\n\nAlthough ''The Terminator'' was a success for Cameron, the critical and commercial success of ''Aliens'' made him a blockbuster director. It also expanded the ''Alien'' series into a franchise, spanning video games, comic books, and toys; although Ripley and the alien creature originated in ''Alien'', Cameron elaborated on the creature's life cycle, added new characters and factions (such as the Colonial Marines), and extended the films' universe.<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> Ripley became a [[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] icon, a proactive hero who retained feminine traits.<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/> ''Aliens'' features popular quotes, including Paxton's \"Game over, man, game over\",<ref name=\"LATimesReunion\"/><ref name=\"UproxxGameOver\"/> and Weaver's \"Get away from her, you bitch,\" which is considered one of ''Aliens''{{'s}} most memorable lines and has often been repeated in other media.<ref name=\"Telegraph11Things\"/><ref name=\"THRLegacy\"/> ''Aliens'' was named by director [[Roland Emmerich]] as one of his top ten science-fiction films, alongside ''Alien''.<ref name=\"EmpireEmmerich\"/>\n\nMany cast and crew members reunited at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, including Weaver, Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser, Henn, Cameron and Hurd. Cameron said he normally would not participate (and did not do so for ''The Terminator''{{'}}s anniversary) but he considered ''Aliens'' special because of its impact on his career.<ref name=\"EWComicCon\"/><ref name=\"LATimesReunion\"/> Asked why he thought ''Aliens''{{'}} popularity had endured, Cameron said:\n{{blockquote|I have to take my filmmaker hat off and look at it as a fan and think, \"Well, I really like those characters&nbsp;...\" There's certain lines, moments, you remember moments. It's satisfying, it ends in a satisfying way&nbsp;... But I actually think it's those characters. We can all relate to Hudson running around \"What the hell are we gonna do now man?

When you think of all the things that something can do, which is projected on a screen, it ticks all those boxes and it makes you laugh.\"<ref name=\"ScreenRantLegacy\"/>}}\n\nThe ensemble cast's popularity led to many members appearing together in later films, including Henriksen, Goldstein, and Paxton in ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) as well as Goldstein and Rolston in ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' (1989).<ref name=\"TheDissolve\"/> Biehn lost a role in Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009) because Weaver had been cast, and the director did not want to create an obvious association with ''Aliens''.<ref name=\"RemarEmpire\"/> Paxton is also remembered as one of only two actors, along with Lance Henriksen, to play characters killed by an alien, a Terminator (in ''The Terminator''), and a [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] (in 1990's ''[[Predator 2]]'').<ref name=\"DailyBeastPaxton\"/> Despite her sudden fame, Henn decided not to pursue acting, so that she could remain close to her family.
