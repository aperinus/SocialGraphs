The United States sends the naval vessel ''Abraham Lincoln'' to investigate. During their search, the vessel runs into the \"monster,\u201d and it damages their ship. The mysterious monster turns out to be ''[[Nautilus (fictional submarine)|Nautilus]]'', the technologically advanced submarine of [[Captain Nemo]]. After the attack, the ''Abraham Lincoln'' is adrift with no rudder. Then, a \"strange rescue\" takes place. Captain Nemo guides his submarine directly beneath the four people who had been aboard the ship and fallen into the sea during the attack. ''Nautilus'' surfaces, and Nemo's crew brings the four rescued individuals aboard the submarine. The four include master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land, a professor Pierre Aronnax, his daughter, and the professor's assistant. Once aboard the submarine, the four must swear they will not attempt to escape. The captain introduces them to his vessel and the wonders of its underwater realm. He later takes them hunting on the seafloor.\n\nMeanwhile, union soldiers in a runaway [[Union Army Balloon Corps|Union Army balloon]] are marooned on a mysterious island. The soldiers find a [[Feral child|wild girl]] living alone. Soon the yacht of Charles Denver arrives at the island. A woman's ghost (Princess Daaker) has haunted Denver, a former British colonial officer in India, whom he attacked years ago. Rather than submit to him sexually, she had stabbed and killed herself. Denver then fled with her young daughter only to abandon her on the island. Long tormented by his crime, he returned to find the girl or determine what happened to her.\n\nOne soldier scheme to kidnap the child aboard Denver's yacht. Another hears of the plan and starts swimming to the yacht to rescue her. Simultaneously, Nemo discovers the yacht belongs to Denver, the enemy he has been seeking all these years. The ''Nautilus'' destroys the yacht with a torpedo, but Captain Nemo saves the girl and her rescuer.\n\nIn elaborate flashback scenes to India, Nemo reveals he is Prince Daaker and created the Nautilus to seek revenge on Charles Denver. It overjoyed him to discover that the abandoned wild girl is his long-lost daughter, but his emotion overcomes him, and he dies. His loyal crew buries him at the ocean bottom. They disband and set the ''Nautilus'' adrift.\n<ref>Review, synopsis and link to watch the film {{cite web |url=http://a-cinema-history.blogspot.com/2013/11/20000-leagues-under-sea.html|title=A cinema history|accessdate=June 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n:{|\n! style=\"width: 180px; text-align: left;\" |  Actor\n! style=\"width: 230px; text-align: left;\" |  Role\n|- style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|[[Allen Holubar]]||Captain Nemo\n|-\n|  [[Jane Gail]]||A Child of Nature\n|-\n|[[Matt Moore (actor)|Matt Moore]] ||Lieutenant Bond\n|-\n|[[William Welsh (actor)|William Welsh]]||Charles Denver\n|-\n|[[Curtis Benton]] ||Ned Land\n|-\n|Dan Hanlon ||Professor Aronnax\n|-\n|[[Edna Pendleton]]||Aronnax's Daughter\n|-\n|}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Universal's \"Submarine Picture Crew\".jpg|thumb|Cast and crew of the film]]\nThis was the first motion picture filmed underwater.<ref>{{cite book|author=Krista A.
