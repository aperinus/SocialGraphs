The film begins in the [[Arctic]] in January of one year and moves southward, concluding in [[Antarctica]] in the December of the same year. Along the way, it features the journeys made by three particular species\u2014the [[polar bear]], [[African bush elephant]] and [[humpback whale]]\u2014to highlight the threats to their survival in the face of rapid [[environmental change]]. A companion piece to the 2006 [[BBC Worldwide|BBC]]/[[Discovery Channel|Discovery]] television series ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', the film uses many of the same sequences, though most are edited differently, and features previously unseen footage.\n\n''Earth'' was directed by [[Alastair Fothergill]], the executive producer of the television series, and [[Mark Linfield]], the producer of ''Planet Earth''{{'}}s \"From Pole to Pole\" and \"Seasonal Forests\" episodes. It was co-produced by [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and Greenlight Media, with Discovery providing some of the funding. In North America, the film was released by [[Disneynature]], and was one of the first films under Disney's recently formed nature film label. The same organisations collaborated on Fothergill's previous film, ''Deep Blue'' (2003), itself a companion to his 2001 television series on the natural history of the world's oceans, ''[[The Blue Planet]]''. The British version of ''Earth'' was narrated by [[Patrick Stewart]] and the US version was narrated by [[James Earl Jones]].\n\n''Earth'' was released in cinemas internationally during the final quarter of 2007 and throughout 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0393597/releaseinfo |publisher=IMDb.com |title=Earth (2007) - Release dates |access-date=2009-06-21 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617032749/http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0393597/releaseinfo |url-status=dead }}</ref> With total worldwide box office revenue exceeding [[United States dollar|$]]100 million, ''Earth'' is the second-highest-grossing nature documentary of all time.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/>\n\nA sequel, titled ''Earth: One Amazing Day'', was released in the United States on 6 October 2017. It made its world premiere in [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2017/earth-one-amazing-day|title=BBC Earth Films launches Earth: One Amazing Day in China|work=BBC News|date=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOver the course of a calendar year, ''Earth'' takes the viewer on a journey from the [[North Pole]] in January to the [[South Pole|South]] in December, revealing how plants and animals respond to the power of the sun and the changing seasons. The film focuses on three particular species, the [[polar bear]], [[African bush elephant]] and [[humpback whale]].\n\nStarting in the high [[Arctic]] in January, as the darkness of winter gives way to the sun, a mother polar bear is shown emerging from her den with two new cubs. She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the [[sea ice]] before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a [[walrus]] colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack.\n\nAfrican bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a [[dust storm]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]]. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry [[lion]]s and scavenger [[white-backed vulture]]s. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the [[Okavango Delta]] to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world.\n\nA humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the [[tropics]]. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a {{convert|4000|mi|km|adj=mid}} journey south to the rich feeding grounds near [[Antarctica]], the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they navigate dangerous seas where [[great white shark]]s are filmed breaching as they hunt. [[Sea lion]]s, and [[sailfish]] and [[dolphin]]s combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays. Here, the whales are shown feeding on [[krill]] by trapping them in bubble nets.\n\nThe stories of these individual creatures are woven into the film alongside a great many additional scenes. The supporting cast of animals include [[mandarin duck]]lings filmed jumping from their tree hole nest, [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]] hunting [[caribou]], [[cheetah]] hunting [[Thomson's gazelle]], [[elephant]]s charging at [[white-backed vulture]], [[birds of paradise]] displaying in the [[New Guinea]] [[rainforest]], [[Adelie penguins]] in the Antarctic and [[demoiselle crane]]s on their autumn migration across the [[Himalayas]].\n\n==Themes==\nThe narration is woven around the theme of anthropogenic [[environmental change]]. The three species it features are used to illustrate particular threats to the planet's wildlife. In the Arctic, rising temperatures are causing a greater area of sea ice to melt and threatening the polar bear with [[extinction]] as early as 2030. [[Global warming]] is also disrupting the planet's [[weather system]]s and making seasonal rainfall patterns less predictable. This poses a threat to creatures like elephants, which must travel greater distances to reach water. Rising ocean temperatures have started to kill the [[plankton]] on which humpback whales and most other sea life depend. The film ends with the message that \"it's not too late to make a difference.\"\n\n==Production==\n''Earth'' was produced by Alix Tidmarsh of BBC Worldwide and Sophokles Tasioulis of Greenlight Media. Following ''Deep Blue'', it is the second film of a five-picture deal between the two companies. The process of bringing ''Planet Earth'' and ''Earth'' to the screen took over five years. With a budget of $47 million, the film was the most expensive production in the history of documentary filmmaking at the time, later to be surpassed by ''[[Oceans (film)|Oceans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grhomeboy.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/%E2%80%98earth%E2%80%99-vision-and-the-art-of-persuasion/ |title=''Earth'': Vision and the art of persuasion |publisher=HomeboyMediaNews |access-date=2009-06-21}}</ref> Principal photography began in 2004 and was completed in 2006.\n\n==Release==\nThe movie's tentative title was titled ''Planet Earth'', the same as the TV series.

Disney announced that the movie would be released under their then-new [[Disneynature]] film unit, which would specialise in natural history documentaries for the first time since ''[[True-Life Adventures]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title=Disney gets back to nature|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/22/business/fi-disney22|access-date=20 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 April 2008|author2=Dawn C.

For its first weekend, it opened at #5, grossing $8,825,760, as well as $14,472,792 over the five-day period.

It closed on July 30, 2009 after 100 days of release, ending up with a final gross of $32,011,576, making it a modest success in the US.\n\n''Earth'' picked up an additional $76,931,115 at the international box office. It took over $30 million in Germany alone, became one of the three highest-grossing films of the year in France and had the best opening of any natural history documentary in Spain. By contrast, in the UK ''Earth'' debuted on just 14 screens and amassed less than [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]75,000 in ticket sales.\n\nIn January 2008, the Japanese version of ''Earth'', narrated by actor [[Ken Watanabe]], knocked [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] blockbuster ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' off the top of the box office despite opening on half the number of screens. It went on to gross more than 2 billion yen ($18.5 million), making it the most successful documentary there of the last 10 years.\n\nIts worldwide total of $108,942,691 made ''Earth'' a commercial success and placed it second on the all-time list of highest-grossing nature documentaries, behind ''[[March of the Penguins]]''.\n\n==Sequel==\nOn 6 October 2017, a sequel, ''Earth: One Amazing Day'' was released.
