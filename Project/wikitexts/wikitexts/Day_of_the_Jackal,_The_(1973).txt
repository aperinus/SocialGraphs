Based on the 1971 [[The Day of the Jackal|novel of the same name]] by [[Frederick Forsyth]], the film is about a professional assassin known only as the [[Jackal (The Day of the Jackal)|\"Jackal\"]] who is hired to assassinate French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] in the summer of 1962.<ref name=\"catholic-herald\"/><ref name=\"on-this-day\" />\n\n''The Day of the Jackal'' received positive reviews and went on to win the [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing]] (Ralph Kemplen), five additional [[BAFTA Award]] nominations, two [[Golden Globe]] Award nominations, and one [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination. The film grossed $16,056,255 at the box office,<ref name=\"numbers\"/> and earned an additional $8,525,000 in North American rentals.<ref name=\"variety\"/> The [[British Film Institute]] ranked it the [[BFI Top 100 British films|74th greatest British film of the 20th century]].<ref>[http://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films''] (1999). Retrieved 27 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn 22 August 1962, the [[militant]] underground organisation [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]], infuriated by the French government [[Algerian independence|granting independence to Algeria]], attempt to assassinate [[President of France|French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The assassination attempt fails, leaving de Gaulle and his entire entourage unharmed. Within six months, OAS leader [[Jean Bastien-Thiry]] and several other members are captured and Bastien-Thiry is executed.\n\nThe remaining OAS leaders, now hiding in Austria, plan another attempt, and hire a British assassin, who goes by the code name, \"Jackal\", for $500,000. The Jackal travels to [[Genoa]] and commissions a custom-made rifle from a gunsmith, and fake identity papers from a forger, whom the Jackal kills when the man tries blackmailing him. In [[Paris]], the Jackal duplicates a key to a flat overlooking the [[Place du 18 juin 1940]].\n\nThe OAS relocate to [[Rome]]. The French [[Division Action|Action Service]] kidnap the OAS's chief clerk, Viktor Wolenski. Wolenski dies under interrogation, but not before the agents extract vital information about the plot, including the word \"Jackal\". The [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] convenes a secret cabinet meeting of the heads of the French security forces. Police Commissioner Berthier recommends his deputy, Claude Lebel, to lead the investigation. Lebel is given special emergency powers, though de Gaulle's refusal to change his planned appearances complicates matters.\n\nColonel St. Clair, a personal military aide to de Gaulle and a cabinet member, carelessly discloses classified government information to his mistress, Denise, unaware she is an OAS agent. She passes this on to her contact, which, in turn, aids the Jackal. Meanwhile, Lebel determines that British suspect Charles Calthrop may be travelling under the name Paul Oliver Duggan, who died as a child, and has entered France.\n\nAlthough the Jackal learns the authorities have uncovered the assassination plot, he decides to proceed. While at a hotel, the Jackal meets and seduces the aristocratic Colette de Montpellier. Warned by his contact, the Jackal leaves just before Lebel and his men arrive. After a nearly fatal vehicular accident, the Jackal steals a car and drives to Madame de Montpellier's country estate to hide out. He kills her after discovering the police have already spoken to her. Using a stolen passport, the Jackal then assumes the identity of a bespectacled Danish schoolteacher named Per Lundquist. After disposing of Duggan's belongings in a river, he catches a train for Paris.\n\nMadame de Montpellier's body is discovered and her car is recovered at the railway station. Lebel, no longer hindered by secrecy restrictions, launches a public manhunt. The Jackal picks up a gay man at a [[Turkish bath]]house and stays at the man's flat. The Jackal kills him after the man sees a TV news broadcast that \"Lundquist\" is wanted for murder.\n\nAt a meeting with the Interior Minister's cabinet, Lebel says he believes the Jackal will attempt to shoot de Gaulle during the commemoration of the [[liberation of Paris]] during [[World War II]], scheduled three days hence. Lebel plays a recording of a phone call in which St. Clair's mistress, Denise, is heard providing information to an OAS contact. St. Clair apologises for his indiscretion and immediately leaves. When asked how he knew St. Clair was the source of the leak, Lebel says he wiretapped every cabinet member's phone. Denise returns to St. Clair's apartment and discovers that he has committed suicide and finds the police are waiting for her.\n\nOn [[Liberation of Paris]] Day, the Jackal, disguised as an elderly veteran amputee on crutches, enters a building using the key he had earlier procured. In an upper apartment overlooking the ceremonial area, he assembles the rifle hidden within his crutch and waits by the window. When Lebel discovers that a policeman allowed a disabled man to pass through the security cordon, the two race to the building. As de Gaulle presents the first medal, the Jackal takes aim but as he shoots he narrowly misses when the president suddenly leans forward. As he reloads the rifle for another shot, Lebel and the policeman burst in. The Jackal shoots the policeman, but Lebel kills him using the cop's submachine gun.\n\nThe Jackal is buried in an unmarked grave, with Lebel as the only witness. While police are searching Charles Calthrop's flat, the real Calthrop suddenly arrives. He accompanies police to [[Scotland Yard]] and is later cleared. Inspector Thomas then asks who the Jackal really was.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as [[Jackal (The Day of the Jackal)|the Jackal]], also known as Paul Duggan & Per Lundquist\n* [[Michel Lonsdale]] as Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel\n* [[Terence Alexander]] as Lloyd\n* [[Michel Auclair]] as Colonel Rolland\n* [[Alan Badel]] as the French Interior Minister\n* [[Tony Britton]] as Superintendent Brian Thomas\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Caron\n* [[Denis Carey (actor)|Denis Carey]] as Casson\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as the Gunsmith\n* [[Maurice Denham]] as General Colbert\n* [[Delphine Seyrig]] as Colette de Montpellier\n* [[Jacques Fran\u00e7ois]] as Pascal\n* [[Olga Georges-Picot]] as Denise\n* [[Raymond G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] as Flavigny\n* [[Barrie Ingham]] as St. Clair\n* [[Jean Martin]] as Victor Wolenski\n* [[Ronald Pickup]] as the Forger\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as the Interrogator\n* [[Eric Porter]] as Col.

Although Universal favoured Nicholson, Zinnemann ultimately secured a production agreement stipulating that only European actors would be cast. Afterwards British actors [[David McCallum]], [[Ian Richardson]], and [[Michael York]] were considered before Zinnemann cast Edward Fox. [[Jacqueline Bisset]] was offered the role of Denise but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Day of the Jackal|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/54876-THE-DAYOFTHEJACKAL?sid=88e99139-ddc3-428c-84bf-4398f4d251b5&sr=9.532975&cp=1&pos=0|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-07|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nZinnemann wrote that Adrien Cayla-Legrand, the actor who played de Gaulle, was mistaken by several Parisians for the real de Gaulle during filming\u2014though de Gaulle had been dead for two years prior to the film's release. The sequence was filmed during a real parade, leading to confusion; the crowd (many of whom were unaware that a film was being shot) mistook the actors portraying police officers for real officers, and many tried to help them arrest the \"suspects\" they were apprehending in the crowd.\n\n[[File:British Museum Reading Room Section Feb 2006.jpg|thumb|The Reading Room at the British Museum Library, where the Jackal reads ''Le Figaro'']]\n[[File:Hotel Negresco fa\u00e7ade.JPG|thumb|Hotel Negresco in Nice where the Jackal learns his mission has been revealed.]]\n\n''The Day of the Jackal'' was filmed in studios and on location in France, Britain, Italy and Austria.<ref name=\"tcm-nixon\"/> Zinnemann was able to film in locations usually denied to filmmakers\u2014such as inside the Ministry of the Interior\u2014due in large part to French producer Julien Derode's skill in dealing with authorities.<ref name=\"tcm-nixon\"/> Nevertheless, the opening sequence was not shot in the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace|\u00c9lys\u00e9e]] courtyard but at the [[h\u00f4tel de Soubise]], main office of the [[French National Archives]]. The two palaces were both built at the beginning of the 18th century, but the H\u00f4tel de Soubise is more accessible and has less security than the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.\n\nDuring the massive annual 14 July parade down the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], the company was allowed to film inside the police lines, capturing extraordinary closeup footage of the massing of troops, tanks, and artillery during the final [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation Day]] sequence. During the weekend of 15 August, the Paris police cleared a very busy square of all traffic to film additional scenes.<ref name=\"tcm-nixon\"/><ref name=\"movie-locations\"/>\n\nFrederick Forsyth later wrote that for the film contract to buy rights for his novel, he was offered two options: \u00a317,500 plus a small percentage of subsequent film profits, or \u00a320,000 and no royalties. He took \u00a320,000, noting that such a payment was already a massive sum to him, but due to his naivety about finances he waived rights to a small fortune in royalties given the film's enduring success.<ref>Forsyth, Frederick (2015).

The 1997 film is about an assassin nicknamed ''The Jackal'' who wants to assassinate a highly significant target, but other than that, it has little in common with the original story. [[Frederick Forsyth]] refused to allow his name to be used in connection with it, and director [[Fred Zinnemann]] fought with the studio to ensure that the new film did not share the first film's title.\n\nIn 1988, the same plot inspired the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[August 1 (film)|August 1]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[BFI Top 100 British films]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref
