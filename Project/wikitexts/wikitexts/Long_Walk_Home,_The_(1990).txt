He had submitted his script to the Cinema Department for consideration, hoping also to direct it. While USC selected Cork's script for production, the department assigned Beverlyn E. Fray, another student, to direct it.\nThe scenario on which the film is based, actually happened to Cork and his maid, Elizabeth Gregory Taylor, in his hometown of Montgomery, Alabama.  \nThe short film won several awards, including first place at the Black American Cinema Society. Cork, however, was unhappy with the finished project and unsuccessfully tried to block screenings of the short film.<ref name='LAT-4Feb1988'>{{cite news |title=USC Student Suit Challenges Film-TV School Practices |first=Michael |last=Cieply |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-04/entertainment/ca-40597_1_film-school |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, California |date=1988-02-04 |accessdate=2011-10-29 |quote=John Cork, a 26-year-old directing student, asked the court to block screenings of \"The Long Walk Home.\" The award-winning short film was based on a screenplay written by Cork, but directed by another student. }}</ref><ref name='LAT-18Jan1988'>{{cite news |title=USC Student First in Cinema Society Contest |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-18/entertainment/ca-24534_1_usc-society-student |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, California |date=1988-01-18 |accessdate=2011-10-29 |quote=USC graduate student Beverlyn E.

Odessa and her family confront typical issues faced by African Americans in the South at the time: poverty, racism, segregation, and violence. The black community has begun a widespread boycott of the city-owned buses to end segregation; Odessa is forced to take long walks both ways to work.\n\nMiriam Thompson offers to give her a ride two days a week to ensure she gets to work on time and to lessen the fatigue her \"long walk home\" is causing. Around the city, some informal carpools and other systems are starting, but most of the blacks are forced to walk to work.\n\nAs the boycott continues, tensions rise in the city. Blacks had been the majority riders on the city-owned buses, and the system is suffering financially. Miriam's decision to support Odessa by giving her a ride becomes an issue with her husband, Norman Thompson ([[Dwight Schultz]]), and other prominent members of the white community who want the boycott to end. Miriam has to choose between what she believes is right or succumb to pressure from her husband and their friends.\n\nAfter an argument with her husband, Miriam decides to follow her heart. She becomes involved in a carpool group to help other black workers like Odessa. In the film's final scene, Miriam and her daughter Mary Catherine ([[Lexi Randall]]), who is the narrator of the story in flashback, join Odessa and the other protesters in standing against oppression.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sissy Spacek]]              as\t Miriam Thompson\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]]\tas\t Odessa Cotter\n* [[Dwight Schultz]]\t        as      Norman Thompson\n* [[Ving Rhames]]\t        as      Herbert Cotter\n* [[Dylan Baker]]\t        as      Tunker Thompson\n* [[Erika Alexander]]       \tas\t Selma Cotter\n* [[Lexi Randall]]\t         as     Mary Catherine (as Lexi Faith Randall)\n* [[Richard Parnell Habersham]]  as     Theodore Cotter\n* [[Jason Weaver]]\t         as     Franklin Cotter\n* [[Crystal Robbins]]\t         as     Sara Thompson\n* [[Cherene Snow]]\t         as     Claudia\n* [[Chelcie Ross]]\t         as     Martin\n* [[Dan Butler]]\t                  as    Charlie\n* [[Philip Sterling]]      \t as     Winston\n* [[Schuyler Fisk]]              as\t Judy (Girl at Oak Park)\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]]           as      Narrator\n\n==Development==\nOne of the three [[GM \"old-look\" transit bus]]es used in this film was the Montgomery Bus Lines bus #2857, which [[Rosa Parks]] had been riding when she refused to give up her seat and was arrested. (Her arrest was the catalyst for the black community's calling the boycott.) By the time of the film, the bus was in poor condition. The filmmakers had it given a partial repaint and towed it by a cable for its scenes in the movie. It is now owned by the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], where it is on permanent display.\n\n[[Cinematographer]] [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]] was to have made his directorial debut on this film but was replaced by [[Richard Pearce (director)|Richard Pearce]] early into production.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically on December 21, 1990. In the U.S., it gained another theatrical release in March 1991 after [[Miramax]] withdrew the film from its limited December 1990 release due to the heavy competition of the 1990 holiday season.\n\nAfter the film's theatrical run, it was released to videocassette by [[Live Home Video]] in the United States and in Canada that same year by [[Cineplex Odeon]].\n\nIn 2002, the film was released twice on DVD by [[Platinum Disc]] and [[Artisan Entertainment]], both presented in full-screen without bonus features. Both DVDs are now discontinued. On January 29, 2013, a new DVD was released by [[Lionsgate]], under license from [[Miramax]]. It is still in full-screen and does not contain any bonus features. A [[widescreen]] [[DVD]] is available in Spain.\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n''The Long Walk Home'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of 16 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.7 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Long Walk Home|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1031744-long_walk_home/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=17 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the performances by Spacek and Goldberg, while criticizing some aspects of the film, like the inclusion of a white \"narrator\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |title= The Long Walk Home Movie Review |date= 1991-03-22 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-long-walk-home-1991|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate= 2016-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil rights movement in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0100046|The Long Walk Home}}\n* {{Mojo title|longwalkhome|The Long Walk Home}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1031744-long_walk_home|The Long Walk Home}}\n\n{{Richard Pearce|state=expanded}}\n{{Civil rights movement}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long Walk Home, The}}\n[[Category:1990 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:Civil rights movement in film]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Fenton]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Pearce]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1955]]\n[[Category:Films set in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Films about activists]]\n[[Category:African-American drama films]]\n[[Category:Works about bus transport]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
