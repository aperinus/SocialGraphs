Based on [[Lee Falk]]'s comic strip ''[[The Phantom]]'' by [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]], the film stars [[Billy Zane]] as a seemingly immortal crimefighter and his battle against all forms of evil. ''The Phantom'' also stars [[Treat Williams]], [[Kristy Swanson]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[James Remar]] and [[Patrick McGoohan]]. The film's screenplay by [[Jeffrey Boam]] is loosely inspired by three of ''The Phantom'' stories, \"The Singh Brotherhood\", \"The Sky Band\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/phantom.html |title=The Phantom movie review |publisher=Ram.org |access-date=2011-02-28}}</ref> and \"The Belt\", but adds supernatural elements and several new characters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 1995 and concluded on February 13, 1996. The film was shot in California, Thailand and Australia.\n\n''The Phantom'' was released on June 7, 1996, and received mixed reviews from film critics, who were divided over whether its pulp adventure approach was charming and authentic or vapid and dull. Despite financial failure in its theatrical release, the film has enjoyed success on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], and has developed a [[cult following]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09042008/gossip/liz/phantom_of_cinema_returns_127382.htm |title='Phantom' Of Cinema Returns |last=Smith|first=Liz|newspaper= New York Post |date=September 4, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906211827/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09042008/gossip/liz/phantom_of_cinema_returns_127382.htm |archive-date=September 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early [[16th century]], a young boy helplessly witnesses his father killed by Kabai Sengh, the ruthless leader of the Sengh Brotherhood, who attacked their ship. The boy jumps overboard and is washed ashore on Bengalla, an island where local tribesmen find him and take him to their village. There he is given the Skull Ring, swears to devote his life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, and as an adult, adopts the identity of \"The Phantom\", a masked avenger. The role of The Phantom is passed on from father to son through 400 years, leading people to believe in a single, immortal figure.\n\nIn 1938, Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom, finds Quill leading a mercenary group in the jungle searching for one of the Skulls of Touganda, which grants its owner a tremendously destructive power. The Phantom saves the native boy they kidnapped to be their guide and captures Quill's men, leaving them for the Jungle Patrol to pick up. Revealed to be a Sengh Brotherhood member and the man who killed Kit's father - whose ghost frequently appears to give Kit advice - Quill flees with the Skull and returns to the United States.\n\nIn [[New York City]], Kit's college ex-girlfriend, Diana Palmer, is a frequent traveler whose uncle, Dave Palmer, is the famous owner of the ''World Tribune'' newspaper. The paper has been investigating power-hungry businessman Xander Drax, a shady character with a reputation for dealing with criminals. Palmer has uncovered Drax's connection to a mysterious spider web symbol, which he traces back to the Bengalla Jungle. He sends Diana to investigate but makes the mistake of telling New York's corrupt police commissioner, who is allied with Drax, of Diana's trip. Drax's female [[air pirate]]s led by [[femme fatale]], Sala, hijack the plane; Diana is abducted and taken to their waterfront base in Bengalla. Having been informed of Diana's abduction by the Jungle Patrol's captain, Phillip Horton, the Phantom rescues her and escapes from Quill and his men to his headquarters, the Skull Cave.\n\nIn New York, now dressed as his civilian self, Kit meets with David Palmer at the ''World Tribune'' and once again meets with Diana, who has mixed feelings about him since his sudden disappearance several years before. Diana's would-be husband Jimmy Wells mentions he had seen one of the skulls in the [[Natural history museum|Museum of World History]], so Kit and Diana hurry there. Drax and his men capture them, steal the second Skull and unite it with the first, revealing the location of the third Skull on an uncharted island in the [[Andaman Sea]], known as the Devil's Vortex. Kit manages to escape and, as the Phantom, evades the police outside the museum. Meanwhile, after Sala reveals that Diana is the Phantom's girlfriend, she flies Drax, Quill, and Diana to the Devil's Vortex, not knowing that the Phantom has managed to hitch a ride on one of the plane's landing pontoons.\n\nOn the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh, direct descendant of the Brotherhood's original leader, who possesses the third Skull. Sengh warns Drax of the Fourth Skull's existence, which controls the power of the other three. The Phantom appears and battles both men, with Kabai Sengh killed by sharks, and Diana and Sala cooperate to defeat the other villains. Drax unites the three Skulls and turns their power against the Phantom; Quill is accidentally hit and disintegrated in the process. The Phantom uses the Fourth Skull \u2013 his ring \u2013 to turn the Skulls' power back against them, destroying them and Drax in a powerful explosion. As the energy destroys the island, the Phantom narrowly escapes with Diana and Sala.\n\nReturning to Bengalla, Diana reveals to the Phantom that she has figured out his secret and double identity. Kit removes his mask, telling her that he can only disclose all of his secrets to one person, the woman he intends to marry, but she leaves again for New York. Kit's father laments his son's failure to pursue Diana but states that she will return to the Phantom's jungle, and Kit, one day.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Zane]] as [[Phantom (comics)|Kit Walker / Phantom]]\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Xander Drax\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as [[Diana Palmer (The Phantom)|Diana Palmer]]\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Sala\n* [[James Remar]] as Quill\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as Mr. Walker / The 20th Phantom\n* [[Radmar Agana Jao]] as [[Guran]] \n* [[Robert Coleby]] as Captain Philip Horton\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as The Great Kabai Sengh\n* [[Bill Smitrovich]] as Dave Palmer\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Morgan\n* [[David Proval]] as Charlie Zephro\n* Joseph Ragno as Ray Zephro\n* [[Al Ruscio]] as Police Commissioner Farley\n* [[Samantha Eggar]] as Lily Palmer\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as Jimmy Wells\n* [[John Capodice]] as Al, The Cabby\n\n==Production==\nRumours of a Phantom film adaptation had first started to circulate when director [[Sergio Leone]] expressed his interest in the property in an interview. Leone had started to write a script and scout locations for his proposed film version of the Phantom, which he planned to be followed by an adaptation of Lee Falk's other comic-strip hero, [[Mandrake the Magician]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.superherohype.com/archive/index.php/t-271315.html |title=Mandrake The magician [Archive&#93; - The Superhero Hype!

Dante and Boam's script was originally tongue-in-cheek in tone and the climax included a winged demon. When Paramount pushed the film back a year, Dante left for other commitments, and eventually ended up being credited as one of the executive producers.  According to Dante:\n<blockquote>I developed the script with the late Jeff Boam, who wrote ''[[Innerspace]]'', as a kind of a spoof. We were a few weeks away from shooting in Australia when the plug was pulled over the budget and the presence of a winged demon at the climax. A year or so later it was put back into production \u2013 sans demon \u2013 only nobody seemed to notice it was written to be funny, so it was \u2013 disastrously \u2013 played straight. Many unintentionally funny moments were cut after a raucous test screening and I foolishly refused money to take my name off the picture, so I'm credited as one of a zillion producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/11012/the_den_of_geek_interview_joe_dante.html |title=The Den of Geek interview: Joe Dante |publisher=Den of Geek |access-date=2011-02-28}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[Joel Schumacher]] was considered to direct the film, but the job was given to Simon Wincer, who had been a fan of the character since childhood.{{citation needed|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=February 2019}} When he traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Paramount executives, he discovered that they intended to release the film in July 1996.{{citation needed|reason=[[WP:DAILYMAIL]]|date=February 2019}} ''The Phantom'' was originally intended to be filmed in Hawaii, and the [[production schedule]] would go over budget by $10 million.

Shooting continued on Hollywood studio [[backlot]] streets that recreated the 1938 version of [[New York City]]. Over fifty vintage cars were used on the streets, and four hundred extras costumed in authentic period clothing were employed.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/>\n\nIn October, the production traveled to [[Thailand]] for seven weeks of filming there, with the country doubling as the Phantom's fictional home country Bengalla. Action scenes such as the Phantom saving a boy from a collapsing [[rope bridge]] were filmed here. Production designer Paul Peters changed a deserted warehouse in the town [[Krabi]] into a large sound stage, where the Phantom's [[Skull Cave]] abode was erected, including his Chronicle Chamber, vault, and radio and treasure rooms.\n\nIn December, the crew traveled to [[Australia]], where production occupied eight [[sound stage]]s at the [[Village Roadshow Studios]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> At Stage 5, the Singh Pirates Cave was constructed, constituting the largest interior setting ever built in the country. The New York offices of Xander Drax were constructed on Stage 6. Filming in Queensland also took the production to the [[Brisbane City Hall]], where the interior lobby was redecorated to resemble a New York museum, where Kit Walker finds one of the three Skulls of Touganda. [[Manor Apartment Hotel]] in Brisbane was used as a stand in for a New York skyscraper.\n\nOn the final day of shooting, the production relocated to Los Angeles, California to complete a scene that would ultimately end up deleted from the final cut of the film, where the Phantom wrestles a lion. Filming concluded on February 13, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thephantom.com/prodnote.html |title=The Phantom - Production Notes |publisher=Paramount Pictures |access-date=January 25, 2019 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971212072835/http://www.thephantom.com:80/prodnote.html|archive-date=December 12, 1997}}</ref>\n\nMany scenes developing the romance between the Phantom/Kit Walker and Diana Palmer were cut in order to make the film more fast-paced. An action scene featuring the Phantom fighting a snake was also cut. A scene with the Phantom and his horse Hero [[Rear (horse)|rearing]] in the sunset was cut out of the film, but shown at the end of the 1996 [[A&E Network|A&E]] documentary ''The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader''.\n\n==Relation to the original stories==\nThe film features several elements from Lee Falk's first two Phantom stories from the 1936 daily newspaper strips, \"The Singh Brotherhood\" and \"The Sky Band\". Several of the characters in the film derive from these stories: Kabai Sengh (played by [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]), leader of the Sengh Brotherhood (the name of the brotherhood was changed to 'Sengh' in the film, to avoid offending people named Singh), Sala (played by [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), leader of the Sky Band, a group of female [[air pirate]]s, and Jimmy Wells ([[Jon Tenney]]), a wealthy playboy.\n\nThe more realistic plots of Falk's original stories were dropped in favor of an adventure tale that featured the supernatural \"Skulls of Touganda\". Falk's story \"The Belt\",<ref>\"The Belt\", 1954 Sunday strips, #37; reworked for the 1962 Gold Key comics, issue #8</ref> where the Phantom fights the killer of his father, was also a major influence on the story, but the name of the murderer is changed from Rama to Quill, and the 20th Phantom, played by [[Patrick McGoohan]], is portrayed as a much older man in the film than in the comic strip.\n\n==Release==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nTo coincide with the premiere of the film, the Phantom was used as a part of the [[Got Milk?]] campaign, based on the character's drinking milk in the comic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listafterlist.com/tabid/57/listid/4726/Personalities/Got+Milk+People+With+Milk+Moustaches.aspx |title= Got Milk?

For example, in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Kenneth Turan]] described it as a modest, unassuming film which \"is gently self-mocking as opposed to excessively wised up. With a straight-arrow hero and villains that wouldn't scare a tadpole, it holds our interest via its human scale and the pleasure it takes in being true to its origins\". He praised the director's synergy with the script and actors, and approved of how the action sequences rely on practical stunts rather than computer generated images, saying this lends faithfulness to the character's pulp roots.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kenneth |last=Turan |author-link=Kenneth Turan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-07/entertainment/ca-12442_1_current-phantom |title='The Phantom' Does Justice to Its Simple Origins |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 7, 1996 |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Godfrey Cheshire III]] similarly wrote in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that the film \"brings a light touch to appealingly old-fashioned action material, creating a fast-moving yarn\". He approved of the decision to sidestep the Phantom's African origin (which was considered racially insensitive by the time of the film's release) instead of reworking it, and while he acknowledged that the character's portrayal is two-dimensional, he felt that this was also appropriate to the old-fashioned tone.<ref>{{cite web|first=Godfrey |last=Cheshire |author-link=Godfrey Cheshire III|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-phantom-3-1200446049/ |title=THE PHANTOM  |website=variety.com |date=7 June 1996 |access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref>\n\nBritish critic [[Kim Newman]] wrote for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' that the film \"has a pleasant feel \u2013 few superheroes have been as sunny and optimistic \u2013 as Zane breezes through chases and fights, stops for the odd quip \u2013 and pals around with a heroic horse, a dashing dog and the helpful ghost of his father\", and gave the film three out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=3139 |title=The Phantom Review|work=Empire |access-date=February 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviled the title character as hopelessly outdated, adding that \"as the Phantom, Billy Zane, buff to the max, has a likable insouciance, but there's not much he can do to flesh out this relic.
