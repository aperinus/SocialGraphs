Her success is such that a line of porcelain dolls is made in her image. Meanwhile, her shy older sister Blanche lives in her shadow and is treated with contempt by the haughty Jane. As the sisters pass adolescence, their situations undergo a reversal; Jane's style of performing falls out of fashion, and her career declines as she descends into [[alcoholism]], while Blanche becomes an acclaimed [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actress. Mindful of a promise made to their mother, Blanche attempts to maintain a semblance of a career for Jane, going as far as to prevail on producers to guarantee acting roles for her. One evening in 1935, Blanche's career is cut short when she is paralyzed from the waist down in a mysterious car accident that is unofficially blamed on Jane, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor.\n\n[[Image:Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane trailer.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Joan Crawford]] as Blanche Hudson]]\n\nBy 1962, Blanche and Jane are living together in a mansion purchased with Blanche's movie earnings. Blanche's mobility is limited due to her reliance on a wheelchair and the lack of an elevator to her upstairs bedroom. Jane, psychotic and resentful of Blanche's success, regularly mistreats Blanche and prepares to revive her old act with hired pianist Edwin Flagg. When Blanche informs Jane she intends to sell the house, Jane rightly suspects Blanche will commit her to a [[psychiatric hospital]] once the house is sold. She removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|cutting her off from the outside world]]. During Jane's absence, Blanche desperately drags herself down the stairs and calls her doctor for help. Jane returns to find Blanche on the phone and beats her unconscious before mimicking Blanche's voice to dismiss the doctor. After tying Blanche to her bed and locking her in her room, Jane abruptly fires their housekeeper, Elvira, when she comes to work. While Jane is away, the suspicious Elvira sneaks into the house and attempts to access Blanche's room. Concerned by the lack of a response, Elvira tries to break open the door with a hammer. Jane returns home and reluctantly gives Elvira the key. As soon as Elvira enters Blanche's room, Jane takes the hammer and kills Elvira. Edwin comes by the house but Jane won't answer the door. That night she uses Blanche's wheelchair to move Elvira's body to her car.\n\nA few days later, the police call to tell Jane that Elvira's cousin has reported her missing. Jane panics and prepares to leave, taking Blanche with her. Before they can go, an inebriated Edwin is escorted to the house by police, who leave him there. He discovers Blanche bound to her bed. Edwin flees and notifies the authorities. Jane, in a fit of infantile regression, takes Blanche to a beach where she sang as a child.\n\nThe next morning the news of Elvira's disappearance and Blanche's condition is on the radio and the police are on the lookout. Blanche \u2014 lying starved, dehydrated, and near death on a blanket \u2014 stirs and tells the real story of the car accident to relieve Jane of guilt, saying she is [[paraplegic]] by her own fault: On the night of the accident, Blanche tried to run Jane over because she was angry at her drunken sister for mocking her at a party earlier that night. Blanche's spine broke when her car struck the iron gates outside their mansion, and she dragged herself in front of the car's hood to stage the cause of accident and frame Jane. Blanche took advantage of Jane's shock and subsequent bender, concealing the real cause of the accident from her, which subjected Jane to a life of guilt, loneliness, and servitude. Now aware of the truth, a saddened Jane responds \"You mean all this time, we could have been friends?\" When Jane gets ice cream for herself and Blanche from a nearby refreshment stand, she is recognized by two police officers, who ask her to lead them to Blanche, attracting the attention of nearby beachgoers. Jane dodges the officers' inquiry and dances before the crowd of curious onlookers. The officers find Blanche nearby and rush to her, as the end credit rolls.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Davis]] as [[Baby Jane Hudson|Jane Hudson]]\n** Julie Allred as 9-year-old Jane\n** [[Debbie Burton]] as young Jane's singing voice\n* [[Joan Crawford]] as Blanche Hudson\n** [[Gina Gillespie]] as 13-year-old Blanche\n* [[Victor Buono]] as Edwin Flagg\n* [[Wesley Addy]] as Marty McDonald\n* [[Anne Barton (actress)|Anne Barton]] as Cora Hudson (credited as Ann Barton)\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Dehlia Flagg\n* [[Bert Freed]] as Ben Golden \n* [[Anna Lee]] as Mrs. Bates\n* [[Maidie Norman]] as Elvira Stitt\n* [[Dave Willock]] as Ray Hudson\n* William Aldrich as Lunch Counter Assistant at Beach\n* Ernest Anderson as Ernie the ice-cream vendor<ref>{{Citation|title=What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

In a generally negative review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] observed, \"[Davis and Crawford] do get off some amusing and eventually blood-chilling displays of screaming sororal hatred and general monstrousness ... The feeble attempts that Mr. Aldrich has made to suggest the irony of two once idolized and wealthy females living in such depravity, and the [[pathos]] of their deep-seated envy having brought them to this, wash out very quickly under the flood of sheer grotesquerie. There is nothing moving or particularly significant about these two.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Philip K. Scheuer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also panned the film, writing that Crawford and Davis had been turned into \"grotesque caricatures of themselves\" and that the film \"mocks not only its characters but also the sensibilities of its audience.\"<ref>Scheuer, Philip K.
