It stars [[Kurt Russell]] as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] who murders young women with modified cars he purports to be \"death-proof\". [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Vanessa Ferlito]], [[Jordan Ladd]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]], [[Tracie Thoms]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] co-star as the women he targets.\n\nThe film was originally released theatrically as part of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007), a [[double feature]] that combined ''Death Proof'' with [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s ''[[Planet Terror]]''. After ''Grindhouse'' underperformed at the domestic box office, ''Death Proof'' was released as a standalone feature in other countries and on home media. It received mostly positive reviews for its stunt sequences and tribute to [[exploitation film|exploitation]] cinema, although its pacing was criticized.\n\n==Plot==\nThree friends, Arlene, Shanna and radio DJ \"Jungle\" Julia Lucai, drive down [[Congress Avenue Historic District|Congress Avenue]] in [[Austin, Texas]], on their way to celebrate Julia's birthday. In a bar, Julia reveals that she made a radio announcement offering a free [[lap dance]] from Arlene in return for addressing her as \"Butterfly,\" buying her a drink, and reciting a segment of the poem \"[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]].\" Aging Hollywood [[stunt double]] Mike McKay trails the women to a bar and claims the lap dance. He notes that Julia is on billboards across town, and she is cold towards him. He returns to sit with the group and recites the line to Arlene. She is suspicious, having seen Mike's car earlier that day watching her outside a restaurant, but he convinces her to give him the lap dance.\n\nThe women prepare to depart with Lanna, another friend, to Shanna's family lake house. Pam, Julia's old classmate, is in need of a ride home and accepts Mike's offer. Mike takes Pam to his Hollywood stunt car, which is rigged with a [[roll cage]], and tells her the car is \"death proof.\" Once Pam is in the passenger seat, he reveals it is only death proof for the driver. He speeds and slams on the brakes, smashing Pam's skull on the dashboard, killing her. He catches up with the women's car and drives into it at high speed, killing them. Mike survives with no serious injury. Sheriff McGraw believes that Mike killed the women intentionally, but because Mike was sober while the women were intoxicated, he cannot be charged.\n\nFourteen months later, three young women \u2014 hair and makeup artist Abernathy \"Abbie\" Ross, stuntwoman Kim Mathis, and up-and-coming actress Lee Montgomery \u2014 are driving through [[Lebanon, Tennessee]], where they are shooting a film together. They stop at a convenience store, where Mike watches them from his car. The women are en route to pick up Abbie and Kim's friend, stuntwoman [[Zo\u00eb Bell]], from the airport while Mike inconspicuously photographs them. Zo\u00eb tells them that she wants to test-drive a [[Dodge Challenger#First generation (1970\u20131974)|1970 Dodge Challenger]], the same type of car from the 1971 film ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'', that is for sale nearby. The owner lets them test-drive it unsupervised after Abernathy tells him that Lee is a porn star and will stay behind.\n\nZo\u00eb tells Abernathy and Kim that she wants to play a game they call \"Ship's Mast,\" whereby she [[Car surfing|rides the hood]] holding belts fastened to the car while Kim drives at high speeds. Kim is hesitant, but agrees. The three enjoy the stunt, unaware that Mike is watching them. He [[Rear-end collision|rear-ends]] them in his car, causing Zo\u00eb to accidentally drop one of the belts. After several more collisions, he [[Side collision|T-bones]] them, throwing Zo\u00eb from the hood. Kim shoots Mike's left shoulder, and he flees in his car. Abernathy and Kim cry over the loss of their friend, until Zo\u00eb emerges uninjured. The three agree to catch up to Mike and kill him.\n\nMike has stopped on a narrow road to treat his wound with whiskey. The women rear-end him at a high speed. Zo\u00eb gets out and beats him with a pipe, but he resists and drives off again. After a long chase, the women push Mike's car off the road. They drag him from the wreckage and beat him to [[death]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n<!-- Cast per scrolling credits order. -->\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Mike \"Stuntman Mike\" McKay, a Hollywood stuntman who preys on young women and uses his car to murder them\n* [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] as herself, a New Zealand stunt woman\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Abernathy \"Abbie\" Ross, a hair and makeup artist who is friends with Zoe\n* [[Vanessa Ferlito]] as Arlene \"Butterfly\", a young woman visiting friends in Austin\n* [[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]] as \"Jungle Julia\" Lucai, a popular radio DJ in Austin\n* [[Tracie Thoms]] as Kimberly \"Kim\" Mathis, a stuntwoman who is friends with Zoe\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Pamela \"Pam\", a young woman from Austin who was classmates with Julia\n* [[Jordan Ladd]] as Shanna \"Banana\", a friend of Julia and Arlene\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Leanna \"Lee\" Montgomery, a winsome young starlet who is friends with Abernathy and Kim\n* [[Quentin Tarantino]] as Warren, a bartender in Austin \n* [[Marcy Harriell]] as Marcy\n* [[Eli Roth]] as Dov, a friend of Julia's\n* [[Omar Doom]] as Nate, a friend of Dov\n* [[Michael Bacall]] as Omar, a friend of Dov\n* [[Monica Staggs]] as Lanna Frank, Julia's friend and drug dealer\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Jasper, a Lebanon local\n* [[Michael Parks]] as Ranger [[List of From Dusk till Dawn characters#Earl McGraw|Earl McGraw]]\n* [[James Parks (actor)|James Parks]] as Ranger [[List of From Dusk till Dawn characters#Edgar McGraw|Edgar McGraw]]\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Dr. Dakota Block\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDuring a night of drinking with his friend [[Sean Penn]], Tarantino learned about \"death-proofing\" cars from Penn.<ref>{{cite book|last=Volk|first=Kurt|title=Grindhouse|publisher=[[Weinstein Books]]|date=2007|isbn=978-1602860148|page=155}}</ref> Tarantino developed a fascination with the concept and the story for ''Death Proof'' developed from the way [[stunt man|stuntmen]] would \"death-proof\" stunt cars so a driver could survive horrific, high-speed crashes and collisions.

He started to tell me the story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it ''Death Proof''.' I helped title the movie, but that's it.\"<ref name=\"Wizard\"/> Of the car chases, Tarantino stated: \"[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me\u2014how is that supposed to be impressive?

Roth flew in from Europe, where he was filming ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', to film his scenes, which took one day.\n\nAfter being stunned by stuntwoman [[Zo\u00eb Bell]], who worked as [[Uma Thurman]]'s stunt double in Tarantino's earlier film ''[[Kill Bill]]'', Tarantino wrote her the leading female role. This was her first on-screen acting role, which Bell initially thought was going to be merely a cameo. The character Zo\u00eb was based on the stuntwoman herself and includes small stories based around her real life experiences, some with Tarantino. It wasn't until she saw her name featured on the film posters opposite Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson and Rose McGowan that she realized how big the role was.\n\n''Death Proof'' uses various unconventional techniques to make the film appear more like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout the feature, the film was intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the [[1970s in film|1970s]] which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. A notable example of one of the film's deliberate jump-cuts is seen at the beginning, when the title ''Quentin Tarantino's Thunderbolt'' is shown for a split second before abruptly being replaced by an insert with the title ''Death Proof'', appearing in white lettering on a black background<ref name=\"VFX\">{{cite web | title=VFX World | work=Grindhouse: Pistol-Packing VFX | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3235 | access-date=April 18, 2007 | archive-date=April 15, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415001048/http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3235 | url-status=live }}</ref> (exploitation films were commonly retitled, especially if they received bad press on initial release).\n\nOn the editing of ''Death Proof'', Tarantino stated, \"There is half-an-hour's difference between my ''Death Proof'' and what is playing in ''Grindhouse''.
