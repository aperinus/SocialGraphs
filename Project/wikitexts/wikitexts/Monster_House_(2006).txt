Please add nothing without carefully checking wordcount first. --->\nOn October 30, 1983, 12-year-old DJ Walters witnesses elderly Horace Nebbercracker confiscating a little girl's tricycle and scaring her away from his house. DJ has documented many similar incidents at the Nebbercracker house, which is across the street from his own. The same day, DJ's parents leave for a convention, placing him in the care of teenage babysitter Zee. Later, DJ's friend Chowder loses a basketball in Nebbercracker's lawn; the boys try to retrieve it, but Nebbercracker stops them. He appears to suffer a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and is taken away by an ambulance. \n\nZee's inebriated boyfriend Bones arrives. He reveals that, many years ago, Nebbercracker stole his kite. Bones also relates rumors that Nebbercracker ate his wife. After Zee throws him out, Bones notices his kite on Nebbercracker's porch, tries to retrieve it, and is devoured by the house. DJ and Chowder are attacked by the house when they investigate; the next day, they save young Jenny Bennett, who is selling Halloween candy, from being eaten by the house. Jenny calls police officers Landers and Lister, but the house stays quiet when the officers arrive, and they dismiss the report.\n\nThe trio consults supernatural expert Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski, who speculates the house must be a rare monster created by the merging of a human [[ghost]] and a man-made object, only unbound when its heart is destroyed. Concluding Nebbercracker has died and possessed the house, the children construct a dummy child, filling it with [[cough syrup]] from Chowder's parents' [[pharmacy (shop)|pharmacy]]. They offer the dummy to the house to eat, hoping to put the house to sleep so they can find its heart. Landers and Lister arrive and discover the stolen medicine; as they try to arrest the children, the house eats them, the children, the dummy, and the [[police vehicle|squad car]]. Separated from the officers, who seem to have vanished, the children explore the basement. They find all the stolen toys, and a shrine to Nebbercracker's wife, Constance the Giantess, whose skeleton is encased in cement. The house awakens and attacks them, but they trigger its gag reflex by grabbing its [[uvula]] equivalent, forcing it to vomit them outside.\n\nNebbercracker returns from the hospital alive, and reveals that Constance is the ghost. When he fell in love with her, she was an unwilling participant in a circus [[freak show]], living in a cage and tormented by people throwing things at her. He helped her escape and married her. On Halloween, during the house's construction, some children threw eggs at her. Frightened and enraged, she grabbed an axe. When Nebbercracker tried to stop her, she stumbled and fell into the unfinished basement to her death, her body accidentally being coated in cement. Nebbercracker finished the house in Constance's memory, but her vengeful ghost merged with it, and she became the Monster House. For the next 45 years, he assumed a hostile demeanor to protect innocent people from her.\n\nDJ convinces Nebbercracker that he needs to let Constance go. Constance, overhearing, uses two trees to lift herself from her foundation and chase the children off. Nebbercracker tries to comfort Constance, and explains everything is for the best, but when she sees he intends to blow her up with dynamite, she attacks him. Chowder uses an [[excavator]] to attack Constance and lure her into a pit in a construction site; she falls, but is not destroyed. Jenny lights the dynamite, and DJ swings out on a [[crane (construction)|crane]]'s hook with it, rescuing Chowder while destroying the house with an accurate throw. Freed, Constance's ghost dances with her husband for a moment before ascending to the afterlife. Nebbercracker thanks the three children for freeing him and Constance from their suffering. \n\nThat night, the trio and Nebbercracker gather at the house's still-intact basement, returning all the confiscated items. After everyone leaves, Bones emerges from the basement, unharmed, carrying his kite. [[post-credits scene|During the credits]], Bones discovers Zee is dating Skull. Meanwhile, everyone else devoured by the house escapes alive.\n\n==Voice Cast==\n[[File:Samlerner spencerlocke mitchelmusso.jpg|thumb|''Monster House'' co-stars [[Sam Lerner]], [[Spencer Locke]] and [[Mitchel Musso]] at the [[34th Annie Awards]].]]\n* [[Mitchel Musso]] as Dustin James \"DJ\" Walters\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as Charles \"Chowder\" \n* [[Spencer Locke]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Bennett\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Horace Nebbercracker, Constance's husband\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Elizabeth \"Zee\" \n* [[Kevin James]] as Police Officer Landers\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as Police Officer Lister\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Bones\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Mrs. Walters (credited as \"Mom\"), DJ's mother\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Walters (credited as \"Dad\"), DJ's father\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Constance \"the Giantess\" Nebbercracker, Nebbercracker's wife\n\n==Production==\nThe film was initially set up at [[DreamWorks Animation]], based on a pitch by newcomer [[Gil Kenan]].<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/features/sony-moves-into-dreamworks-monster-house/|title=Sony Moves into DreamWorks' Monster House|publisher=[[Animation Magazine]]|author=Ryan Ball|date=July 20, 2004|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref> Having just finished film school recently, Kenan had been having several meetings with film producers for a while, but he hadn't found any success, with a screenplay based on the ''[[Pac-Man]]'' video game series going unproduced. After Kenan received [[Dan Harmon]]'s and [[Rob Schrab]]'s ''Monster House'' screenplay for [[ImageMovers]], Kenan had a meeting with the head of story Bennett Schneir, where he was able to pitch his vision for the film. Schneir worked for [[Robert Zemeckis]] as the head of development at ImageMovers, and Kenan had a meeting with Zemeckis quickly thereafter, apparently due to the filmmakers wanting to get a director for the project as fast as they could. Upon impressing Zemeckis with his pitch, Kenan then had a meeting with [[Steven Spielberg]], meeting during which he pitched the film to Spielberg in a presentation with some sketches and drawings he had drawn before meeting Zemeckis.<ref name=\"KenanInterview\">{{Cite web |last=Awalt |first=Steven |date=September 27, 2021 |title=Into the 'Monster House' |url=https://amblin.com/article/into-the-monster-house/ |url-status= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=September 27, 2021 |website=[[Amblin Entertainment]]}}</ref> By 2004, the studio put the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], to which [[Sony Pictures]] picked up the project and began production on August 23 of that year.<ref name=\"Origins\" />\n\nThe original screenplay of ''Monster House'' was, in Kenan's words, \"absolutely brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny\". Due to his experience as a storyteller, Kenan decided to preserve all the characters and the tone from Harmon's and Schrab's story, but added the idea that the titular house was possessed by a soul, leading to the creation of Constance Nebbercracker and the house's backstory. To help him revise the script and introduce Constance and Horace Nebbercracker into the plot, Kenan brought [[Pamela Pettler]] after reading her script for ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005). They worked on the script at her house, and to meet the established deadline, they finished a draft quickly and sent it to [[Amy Pascal]] at [[Columbia Pictures]]. As work in the screenplay was underway, in a few months of preparation, Kenan had assembled a team of storyboard artists led by Simeon Wilkins in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]] to put up rudimentary boards with scratch dialogue and temporal score, with Khang Lee and [[Chris Appelhans]] collaborating on paintings for the film.<ref name=\"KenanInterview\" />\n\nThe film was shot using [[performance capture]], in which the actors performed the characters' movement and lines while linked to sensors, a process pioneered by Zemeckis for his film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lostintheplot.com/blog/?p=47 | title=The Animation of Monster House | work=Lost in the Plot | access-date=2007-06-05 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141635/http://www.lostintheplot.com/blog/?p=47 | archive-date=2007-10-08 }}</ref> Zemeckis was in the process of starting filming ''The Polar Express'' when he met Kenan, who visited the set to see how that film was filmed and discussed with Kenan how they would exactly shoot ''Monster House'', deciding that they prioritize the story before the filming technology, though Kenan always felt that the story should use animation to create a world with a living house, as he opined that making the house a viable threat and character would better work in an animated setting.<ref name=\"KenanInterview\" />\n\nThe casting for ''Monster House'' was a laborious process, especially for the lead trio, who were portrayed by [[Mitchel Musso]], [[Sam Lerner]] and [[Spencer Locke]]. Kenan agreed with head of animation Troy Saliba that actors should be needed to portray the roles in a believable way. Many of the film's artists interpreted the roles on set and enhanced the lead actors through posed animation that drove the exaggerations of their performances to make them feel subtle and real.<ref name=\"KenanInterview\" />\n\nEd Verreaux served as the production designer of ''Monster House''. To design the neighbourhood where the story takes place, Verreaux realized that the film's setting needed to resemble that of 1980s films, like ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). During his discussions with Harmon and Schrab, Kenan was told that the film's setting was inspired by that of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minneapolis]]. Verreaux and Kenan went together on a scouting trip to design the film's locations, which involved a visit to [[Universal Studios]]' backlot, during which they were granted access to the suburban street of ''[[The 'Burbs]]'' (1989), the neighborhood of the show ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' and the house of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"KenanInterview\" />\n\n''Monster House'' was the first animated feature film using the [[Arnold (software)|Arnold]] rendering software (co-developed at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]), and the first feature film entirely rendered with unbiased, brute-force [[path tracing]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.arnoldrenderer.com/about/| title=about| website= www.arnoldrenderer.com| publisher=[[Autodesk]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.realtimerendering.com/resources/RTNews/html/rtnv23n1.html#art3| title=Marcos and Arnold| author=Eric Haines| date=July 20, 2010|publisher=Ray Tracing News}}</ref>\n\nYears after the movie came out, Harmon received a letter from an upset 7-year-old who was displeased with the film. Harmon wrote back that he did not finish the script when the studio took it and hired other writers to change it. He further denounced it by stating that Kenan was a hack and called Spielberg a moron.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/community-creator-writes-to-child-disses-spielberg-and-wins-our-hearts/|title=\u2018Community\u2019 Creator Writes to Child, Disses Spielberg and Wins Our Hearts|website=The New York Times|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=March 29, 2010|access-date=July 2, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Digital 3-D version==\nAs with ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'', a [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[3-D film|3-D]] version of the film was created and had a limited special release in digital 3-D stereo along with the \"flat\" version.

The process was not based on film, but was purely digital. Since the original source material was \"built\" in virtual 3-D, it created a very rich stereoscopic environment.
