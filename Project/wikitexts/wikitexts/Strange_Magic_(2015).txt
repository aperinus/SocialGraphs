In the Dark Forest, the Bog King has the same view on love, despite his caring mother Griselda's protests.\n\nMarianne's sister, Dawn, and her elf friend, Sunny, are nearly devoured by a giant lizard before Marianne rescues them. After falling through the border and into the Dark Forest, Sunny finds a [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]] petal and hides it. At the Spring Ball, Roland tries to win back Marianne, who angrily drives him away. Roland consults his warriors, who jokingly tell him to procure the love potion to woo Marianne. Roland then encounters Sunny, who has an unrequited love for Dawn. He convinces Sunny to venture into the Dark Forest to get the love potion, which they would both use on their respective fairies. Sunny goes back and finds the hidden primrose petal and, with the guidance of an Imp, travels to the Bog King's lair, where the Sugar Plum Fairy was being held prisoner by the Bog King. Sunny finds the Sugar Plum Fairy, who agrees to make the love potion if Sunny promises to set her free.\n\nPlum's escape rouses Bog King, who recaptures her while Sunny and the Imp escape. Sunny returns to the ball and tries to hit Dawn with the love potion. Bog interrupts the celebrations and captures Dawn just as she is sprayed by the love potion and the imp steals it in order to spread it throughout the forest. Bog orders them to deliver the potion to him by moon-down or he will harm Dawn. Defying her father's order, Marianne flies off after her sister while he grants Roland a small army to head off on foot to Bog's castle.\n\nDawn falls in love with Bog due to the potion, and Bog has her imprisoned for his own sanity. Marianne arrives and fights with Bog to return her sister. When she realizes the severity of the situation, the two of them begin to find common interests. When they consult Sugar Plum for an antidote, she explains that true love will negate the effects of the potion. A mutual attraction begins to develop between Marianne and Bog, but only Griselda sees it.\n\nSunny recovers the potion from the imp and gives it to Roland as they march on to the castle. Bog sees this and suspects that Marianne had set him up, breaking his heart again as he leaves her stranded in a spider web. She escapes and joins in the battle taking place at the castle. Sunny frees Sugar Plum, Dawn, and the love-stricken forest creatures that the imp had hit with the love potion.\n\nIn the escape, Bog holds the mouth of his den open long enough for everyone to escape. He survives, to Marianne's relief, and Sunny reveals his true feelings to Dawn, and they kiss. Bog and Marianne finally admit their feelings for each other and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Bog King\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Marianne\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Sugar Plum Fairy\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Griselda\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as the Fairy King\n* [[Elijah Kelley]] as Sunny\n* Meredith Anne Bull as Dawn\n* [[Sam Palladio]] as Roland\n* [[Bob Einstein]] as Stuff\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Thang\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Brutus\n* Llou Johnson as Pare\n* [[Robbie Daymond]] as Fairy Cronies\n* [[Brenda Chapman]] as Imp\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] as Plum Elf\n* [[Gary Rydstrom]] as Angry Gus\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[George Lucas]] had long wanted to make a film for his three daughters, with the original idea for the movie being generated 15 years prior.<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine|last1=Roper|first1=Caitlin|title=George Lucas on How His New Film Is Like Star Wars for Girls|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/george-lucas-strange-magic/|magazine=Wired|access-date=25 January 2015}}</ref> He described the film as ''[[Star Wars]]'' for a female audience stating \"''Star Wars'' was for 12-year-old boys; I figured I'd make one for 12-year-old girls.\"<ref name=Metro>{{cite web|last1=Prigge|first1=Matt|title=Interview: George Lucas on why 'Strange Magic' is 'Star Wars' for girls|url=http://www.metro.us/entertainment/interview-george-lucas-on-why-strange-magic-is-star-wars-for-girls/zsJoas---4IVIh8AX8Gv7M/|website=Metro|date=January 20, 2015 |access-date=January 25, 2015}}</ref> On the film's plot, director [[Gary Rydstrom]] stated, \"We pitched it as a ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' story where the Beast doesn't change.\" According to Rydstrom, Lucas \"really wanted to make a beautiful fairy tale with [[goblin]]s and [[Elf|elves]], and do it in a way that only this company can do. He had been working on it for a long time.\" Rydstrom mentioned that Lucas emphasized that the story should be about \"finding beauty in strange places\". Rydstrom also stated \"It was important for him to tell this story where you saw the beauty in something you didn't expect to see\u2014that it looked ugly on the outside but you saw the beauty underneath.\" The film was in the works for 15 years including, at one point development alongside the ''Star Wars'' prequels.<ref name=Metro/> Before [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired [[Lucasfilm]] in late 2012, production on ''Strange Magic'' was already well underway. Rydstrom and his crew screened the film for Disney executives. Rydstrom stated, \"We're not [[Pixar]] or [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]], so in some ways George was our [[John Lasseter|John [Lasseter]]] on this one&nbsp;... I like the fact\u2014not that I don't like advice from all over\u2014but this is our own thing, this is a Lucasfilm project&nbsp;... I remember when ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' came out and how exciting that was. There was a magic to that, this has the same vibe to me.\"<ref name=Trailer/>\n\nOne of the biggest inspirations for the film's soundtrack was another Lucasfilm production, ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973). For ''Strange Magic'', Lucas revealed: \"I had a lot of [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs in there originally, but we couldn't afford them.\" Many of the songs that did make it into the film were tweaked to help tell the story such as \"[[Bad Romance]]\", which became a march for an invading army, and \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\", which was made into a warrior anthem for Marianne. According to Lucas, the main message of the film is that \"A real relationship rests in a much deeper place, where you love somebody and you've thought through it carefully as you've been carrying on conversations and doing things. You fall in love with their mind and everything else more than just the way they look.\"<ref name=Trailer/><ref>{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Love and music make Lucas' 'Strange Magic'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/12/george-lucas-strange-magic-passions/21626077/|work=USA Today|access-date=January 12, 2015|date=January 12, 2015}}</ref> At one point during production the crew experimented with the idea of having the entirety of the dialogue sung.<ref name=Metro/>\n\nThe hair design of sisters Marianne and Dawn went through several revisions. According to Meredith Anne Bull, the voice of Dawn, \"[The sisters'] hair has changed a lot since the beginning, we used to have long, brown hair. It was red for a while and now it has ended up short and blonde!&nbsp;... There's a lot of work that goes into creating the hair of an animated character. There are actually groups of people where that's their only job, to do the animation of hair! That was really cool, learning that.\" On the subject of voice recording, Bull stated, \"There's just a lot of really cool stuff [that our director] would show us\u2014tricks and stuff to do when we were recording: Special effects with our mouths, or by chewing stuff. One time I watched [[Peter Stormare]] chew an entire pack of gum while he was trying to record!\" Bull also noted that while recording she did not have many visuals to reference, \"For the first year of production, I really had no idea, sometimes they would have drawings, but other than that I just had to use my imagination of what was going on!\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Osmanski|first=Stephanie|title=EXCLUSIVE: Meredith Anne Bull from \"Strange Magic\" Spills Disney Movie Secrets|url=http://www.m-magazine.com/posts/meredith-anne-bull-from-strange-magic-spills-disney-movie-secrets-49091|work=m-magazine.com|access-date=January 8, 2015|date=January 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Strange Magic (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = Various artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = January 20, 2015\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = [[Air Lyndhurst Studios]], [[London]]<br>Berry Drive Studios, [[Los Angeles]]<br>Downtown Recording Studios, [[New York City|NYC]]<br>Nightbird Studios,  Los Angeles<br>MSR Studios, New York City<br>The Fan Club, London\n| genre        = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]]\n| length       = 38:04\n| label        = [[Walt Disney Records|Buena Vista]]\n| producer     = {{flat list|\n* [[Marius De Vries]]\n* [[George Lucas]]\n* Steven Gizicki\n}}\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes cast performances of new versions of pop and classic rock songs which were chosen for the film by [[George Lucas]].<ref name=\"Trailer\" /> The soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records|Buena Vista Records]] on January 20, 2015, followed by a physical release on February 17, 2015.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Buena Vista Records Set to Release 'Strange Magic' Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/buena-vista-records-set-to-release-strange-magic-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-300022008.html |access-date=January 21, 2015 |publisher=PR Newswire |date=January 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, there are songs used in the film, but not in the album.
