Fast, and [[Mardi Rustam]].\n\nThe film stars [[Carolyn Jones]], [[Neville Brand]], [[Roberta Collins]], [[Robert Englund]], [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]], [[Marilyn Burns]], Janus Blythe, and [[Kyle Richards]]. Brand plays a psychotic hotel proprietor in rural East Texas, who feeds those who upset him to a large crocodile that lives in a swamp beside the hotel.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter refusing a demand for anal sex from an aggressive customer named Buck, na\u00efve [[prostitute]] Clara Wood is evicted from the town [[brothel]] by the madame, Miss Hattie. Clara makes her way to the decrepit Starlight Hotel, located deep in the remote swampland of rural Texas, where she encounters the hotel's mentally disturbed proprietor, Judd. Suffering from his own demented sexual frustrations, Judd attacks Clara with a pitchfork, then chases her outside, where she is attacked and eaten by his pet [[Nile crocodile]] that lives in the swamp beside the hotel.\n\nSome days later, a fractious couple, the well-dressed, pill popping Faye and her disturbed husband Roy, arrive at the hotel, along with their young daughter and apparent polio victim, Angie. Shortly after their arrival, the family dog, Snoopy, is brutally attacked by the resident crocodile, which sends little Angie into shock. In retaliation, Roy goes out to kill the carnivorous swamp creature, but is stabbed and killed by Judd, who is wielding a large [[scythe]]. Judd then violently beats and straps Faye onto her bed and attempts to grab Angie, but she is able to escape and hides under the hotel's porch.\n\nLater, Harvey Wood and his daughter Libby also arrive at the Starlight Hotel, seeking information on the now-deceased Clara, who is Harvey's runaway daughter, but they leave when Judd denies having seen her. Accompanied by Sheriff Martin, Harvey and Libby question Miss Hattie, who also denies ever seeing Clara. Harvey returns to the creepy swamp hotel alone, while Libby goes for dinner and drinks with the sheriff. After Harvey discovers a captive Faye in her hotel room, Judd murders him, once again utilizing his large scythe.\n\nMeanwhile, after being kicked out of a bar by the sheriff, scummy Buck and his underaged girlfriend Lynette venture to the Starlight, much to the annoyance of Judd. When Buck hears screams coming from Faye and Angie crying under the porch, he tries to rescue the little girl, but is pushed into the swamp by Judd and devoured by the crocodile. Lynette runs outside and is spotted by Judd. She runs into the woods screaming, and he pursues her. However, the fog causes Judd to lose sight of her, and Lynette is saved by a man in a passing car.\n\nLater, Libby arrives back at the hotel and manages to untie Faye from her bed and retrieve Angie from under the porch. Consumed with madness, Judd chases the three survivors into the swamp, where he is finally attacked and killed by his own pet reptile.<ref name=\"muir\">{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=Eaten Alive at a Chainsaw Massacre: The Films of Tobe Hooper|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476613352|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DngwCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA68|access-date=21 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Neville Brand]] as Judd\n* [[Mel Ferrer]] as Harvey Wood\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Miss Hattie\n* [[Marilyn Burns]] as Faye\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Roy\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as Sheriff Martin\n* [[Roberta Collins]] as Clara Wood\n* [[Kyle Richards]] as Angie\n* [[Robert Englund]] as Buck\n* Crystin Sinclaire as Libby Wood\n* [[Janus Blythe]] as Lynette\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=July 2018}}\nWorking under the title ''Death Trap'', ''Eaten Alive'' was filmed entirely on the sound stages of Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California, which had a large-scale pool that could double as a swamp.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Cleaver|title=Eaten Alive: Film Review|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/eaten-alive-film-review/|website=SCREAM Magazine|access-date=20 May 2017|date=15 October 2015}}</ref> Shooting on a [[sound stage]] instead of a practical location contributed to the atmosphere of the film, which director Tobe Hooper described as a \"surrealistic, twilight world.\"<ref name=starburst /> The film eventually proved to be problematic for the director, though, who left the set shortly before production ended, due to a dispute with the producers.<ref>Muir (2002), p. 23.</ref> Hooper's good relationship with his actors remained intact, though.
