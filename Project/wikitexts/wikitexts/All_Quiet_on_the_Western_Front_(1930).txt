Directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], it stars [[Louis Wolheim]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Arnold Lucy]], and [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]]. It is the first Best Picture winner based on a novel.\n\n''All Quiet on the Western Front'' opened to wide acclaim in the United States. Considered a realistic and harrowing account of warfare in [[World War I]], it made the [[American Film Institute]]'s first ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]]'' list in 1997. A decade later, after the same organization polled over 1,501 workers in the creative community, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was ranked the seventh-best American [[epic film]].<ref>{{cite news | author = American Film Institute | author-link = American Film Institute | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 11 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = June 17, 2008 | url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | access-date= June 18, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619034738/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072| archive-date= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Top 10 Epic | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |access-date= June 13, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080619174209/http://www.afi.com/10top10/epic.html| archive-date= June 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In 1991, the film was selected and preserved by the United States [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gamarekian|first1=Barbara|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|date=October 19, 1990|title=Library of Congress Adds 25 Titles to National Film Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/movies/library-of-congress-adds-25-titles-to-national-film-registry.html|access-date=May 18, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref> The film was the first to win the [[Academy Awards]] for both [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nIts sequel, ''[[The Road Back (film)|The Road Back]]'' (1936), portrays members of the 2nd Company returning home after the war.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the [[German Army (German Empire)|Army]] and \"saving the Fatherland\". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul B\u00e4umer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company.  Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss.\n\nThe new soldiers arrive by train at the chaotic combat zone. One in the group is killed before the recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older, unwelcoming veterans. Having not eaten in days, they pay cigarettes to Corporal \"Kat\" Katzinsky (who has stolen a slaughtered hog from a field kitchen) in exchange for a meal.\n\nThe recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans is a harrowing experience, during which Behn is killed. A depiction of [[Trench warfare|trench warfare]] follows with many casualties on both sides. Eventually, they are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\n[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front ad in The Film Daily, Jul-Dec 1929 (page 149 crop).jpg|thumb|350x350px|All Quiet on the Western Front film ad with book cover art in ''[[The Film Daily]]'', 1929]]\nThey hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the [[Causes of World War I|causes of the war]] and of wars in general.\n\nOne day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives at the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation. He is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier and is distraught as he spends the night trapped in a hole with the dying man. He tries and fails to save him, and begs for forgiveness. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.\n\nGoing back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a [[Catholic]] hospital, along with his good friend, Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated and Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive. Still, he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.\n\nPaul is given a furlough and visits his family at home.  He is shocked by how uninformed and optimistic everyone is about the war's actual situation. When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he shares his experiences and disillusionment with the war to Professor Kantorek and his young students, who call him a \"coward\". \n\nDisillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd Company filled with new young recruits, who are now also disillusioned. He discusses the people's inability to comprehend the futility of the war with Kat. Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital, only to find that a second explosion has killed Kat. Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.\n\nIn the final scene, Paul is back on the front line. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Smiling, he reaches out for the butterfly. While reaching, however, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. The final sequence shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lew Ayres]] as Paul B\u00e4umer\n* [[Louis Wolheim]] as Stanislaus Katczinsky\n* [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]] as Himmelstoss\n* [[Arnold Lucy]] as Professor Kantorek\n* [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]] as Franz Kemmerich\n* [[Scott Kolk]] as Leer\n* [[Owen Davis, Jr.]] as Peter\n* [[William Bakewell]] as Albert Kropp\n* [[Russell Gleason]] as M\u00fcller\n* [[Richard Alexander (actor)|Richard Alexander]] as Westhus\n* [[Harold Goodwin (American actor)|Harold Goodwin]] as Detering\n* [[Slim Summerville]] as Tjaden\n* Walter Browne Rogers as Behn\n* [[G.

This scene is different from the book, and was inspired by an earlier scene showing a butterfly collection in Paul's home. The scene was shot during the editing phase, so the actors were no longer available and Milestone had to use his own hand as Paul's.\n\nNoted comedienne [[ZaSu Pitts]] was originally cast as Paul's mother and completed the film but preview audiences, used to seeing her in comic roles, laughed when she appeared onscreen so Milestone re-shot her scenes with [[Beryl Mercer]] before the film was released. The preview audience remains the only one who saw Pitts in the role, although she does appear for about 30 seconds in the film's original preview trailer.\n\nThe film was shot with two cameras side by side, with one negative edited as a sound film and the other edited as an \"[[International Sound Version]]\" for distribution in non-English speaking areas.\n\nA great number of German Army veterans were living in [[Los Angeles]] at the time of filming and were recruited as bit players and technical advisers.
