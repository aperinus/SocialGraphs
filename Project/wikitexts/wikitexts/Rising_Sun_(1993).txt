The film stars [[Sean Connery]] (who was also an executive producer), [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Harvey Keitel]], and [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]. It was based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1992 [[Rising Sun (Crichton novel)|novel of the same name]].<ref>''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; August 2, 1993.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a commencement gala at the newly opened Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a Japanese [[keiretsu]], a [[call girl]] named Cheryl Lynn Austin, is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detectives Webster \"Web\" Smith and John Connor, a former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to act as liaison between the Japanese executives and the investigating officer, Smith's former partner Tom Graham. During the initial investigation, Connor and Smith review surveillance camera footage, and realize that one of the discs is missing.\n\nSmith and Connor suspect Eddie Sakamura, Cheryl's boyfriend and agent of a Nakamoto rival, of killing her, and interrogate him at a house party. Sakamura promises to bring Connor something, and Connor reluctantly lets him go after confiscating his passport. Ishihara, a Nakamoto employee whom Connor had previously interrogated, delivers the missing disc, which clearly shows Sakamura killing Cheryl. Graham and Smith lead a SWAT raid on Sakamura's house. He tries to flee in a [[Vector W8]] sports car, but crashes and is killed.\n\nSmith learns that Sakamura had attempted to contact him about the missing disc, so he and Connor take the disc to an expert, Jingo Asakuma, who reveals that the disc has been digitally altered to implicate Sakamura.\n\nNakamoto is in the midst of sensitive negotiations for the acquisition of an American [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductor company]], with Senator John Morton, a guest at the party, abruptly changing his stance on a bill that would prevent the merger from going through. Suspecting his sudden shift is somehow related to the murder, Connor and Smith attempt to interview him at his campaign office, but without success. Upon returning to Smith's apartment, the duo find Sakamura alive and well. He reveals that he was being tailed that day by Tanaka, a Nakamoto security agent attempting to locate the original disc. Not wanting to be seen with Sakamura, Tanaka stole his sports car and committed suicide by crashing it. Sakamura gives Connor the original disc, but before he can leave, Lt. Graham arrives with Ishihara. Sakamura is killed fighting off Ishihara's men, and Smith is shot and left for dead, surviving only thanks to a bulletproof vest.\n\nAfter being interrogated, Smith is put on paid leave due to an ongoing investigation of an earlier corruption charge. Regrouping with Connor and Jingo, the three view the original surveillance footage, which shows Senator Morton performing [[erotic asphyxiation]] on Cheryl. Falsely believing he killed her, Morton changes his position on the regulation bill to stay in Nakamoto's good graces. After leaving the boardroom, the footage shows another figure approaching and killing Cheryl by strangulation.\n\nHoping to draw the killer out, Connor and Smith fax Morton stills of the footage showing his involvement in the murder. Morton contacts Ishihara, revealing the executive to be in on the cover-up, and then Morton commits suicide. Connor, Smith, and Jingo interrupt the merger negotiations to show Nakamoto President Yoshida the surveillance footage. Bob Richmond, an American lawyer working for Nakamoto, reveals that he is the real killer and tries to run away, only to be killed by Eddie Sakamura's [[yakuza]] friends.\n\nYoshida maintains his and his colleagues innocence, quietly exiling Ishihara to a desk job back in Japan. Smith drives Jingo home, where she casts doubt on whether Richmond was really the murderer, or if he was simply taking the fall to protect someone higher up in the company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Sean Connery]] as Captain John Connor\n*[[Wesley Snipes]] as Lieutenant Webster \"Web\" Smith\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] as Lieutenant Tom Graham\n*[[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Eddie Sakamura\n*[[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]] as Bob Richmond\n*[[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Mr. Yoshida\n*[[Ray Wise]] as Senator John Morton\n*Stan Egi as Masao Ishihara\n*[[Stan Shaw]] as Phillips\n*[[Tia Carrere]] as Jingo Asakuma\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Willy \"The Weasel\" Wilhelm\n*[[Tatjana Patitz]] as Cheryl Lynn Austin\n*[[Peter Crombie]] as Greg\n*[[Sam Lloyd]] as Rick\n*[[Alexandra Powers]] as Julia\n*[[Daniel Von Bargen]] as Chief Olson / Interrogator\n*Lauren Robinson as Zelly\n*[[Amy Hill]] as Hsieh\n*Tom Dahlgren as Jim Donaldson\n*[[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Shoji Tanaka\n*[[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] as Fred Hoffman\n*[[Joey Miyashima]] and Nelson Mashita as Young Japanese Negotiators\n*[[Tamara Tunie]] as Lauren\n*[[Tony Ganios]] as Doorman Guard (Perry)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\nMichael Crichton was paid $1 million for the filming rights of his novel, and was also attached to write the screenplay alongside Michael Backes. After delivering a faithful draft, studio [[20th Century Fox]] asked for a rewrite. Crichton then entered disputes with director Philip Kaufman, who asked for five separate rewrites. Crichton also was not in favor of the decision by Kaufman and [[Joe Roth]] to cast [[Wesley Snipes]] as the protagonist, therefore changing the character's race from Caucasian to African-American. Crichton argued: \u201dIn a movie about U.S.-Japan relations, if you cast someone who\u2019s black, you introduce another aspect because of tension between blacks and Japanese.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1993/08/06/rising-sun-stirs-controversy/|title=''Rising Sun'' stirs controversy|author=Nisid Hajari|website=Ew.com|access-date=3 March 2022}}</ref>\n\nKaufman wound up taking the writing duties, with [[David Mamet]] also delivering a draft. Kaufman tried to get a sole screenwriter credit, but the Writer's Guild arbitration decided that his contributions were not enough to deny a credit to Crichton and Backes. Given Kaufman had a tendency for long movies, Fox made him contractually obligated to deliver a two hour length film, with editing delays pushing the film's release date forward.<ref>{{cite news|title='Rising' Differences: Michael Crichton's best-seller is opening this summer.
