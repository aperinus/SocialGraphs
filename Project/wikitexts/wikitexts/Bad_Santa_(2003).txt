It stars [[Billy Bob Thornton]], with a supporting cast of [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], [[Lauren Graham]], [[Brett Kelly (actor)|Brett Kelly]], [[Lauren Tom]], [[John Ritter]] and [[Bernie Mac]]. It was Ritter's last live-action film appearance before his death on September 11, 2003; the film was dedicated to his memory. The [[Coen brothers]] are credited as [[executive producer]]s. The film was released in the United States on November 26, 2003, and was screened out of competition at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4197317/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bad Santa |access-date=2009-12-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It received positive reviews and was a commercial success.\n\nAn unrated version was released on [[DVD]] on March 5, 2004, and on [[Blu-ray]] on November 20, 2007, as ''Bad(der) Santa''. A [[director's cut]] DVD was released in November 2006; it features Zwigoff's cut of the film (including an [[audio commentary]] with him and the film's editor), which is three minutes shorter than the theatrical cut and ten minutes shorter than the unrated version. A sequel, ''[[Bad Santa 2]]'', was released on November 23, 2016, and failed to match the critical and commercial success of the original.\n\n==Plot==\nWillie T. Soke and his [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] assistant Marcus Skidmore are professional thieves. Every year, Willie gets a job as a department store [[Santa Claus]] and Marcus as an elf to rob shopping malls at night, with Marcus' wife Lois as their getaway driver. Marcus takes his job seriously, but Willie, a [[sexual addiction|sex-addicted]] [[alcoholic]], is steadily falling apart. When they are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Willie's vulgarity shocks the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska, who brings them to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel.\n\nAt the mall, Willie is visited by Thurman Merman, a friendly but exceedingly gullible, dimwitted overweight young boy who assumes Willie is Santa and is constantly bullied by a teenage gang of skateboarders. At a bar, Willie meets Sue, a woman with a Santa Claus fetish, and they begin a sexual relationship. After some casual sex with Sue in Willie's beaten-up [[Chevrolet Impala (fourth generation)|Impala]], Willie is harassed and attacked by a man he had encountered earlier at the bar, but Thurman intervenes. Willie gives Thurman a ride home, where he lives with his senile grandmother. Thurman reveals that his mother died and his father, Roger, is \"exploring mountains\"\u2014actually in jail for embezzlement. Willie tricks Thurman into letting him rob the house safe and steal Roger's [[BMW 7 Series (E38)|BMW 740iL (E38)]].\n\nBob informs Gin that he overheard Willie having sex in a dressing room and Gin starts to investigate. Willie sees his motel room being raided, and moves into Thurman's house, much to Thurman's delight. Marcus is angry at Willie for taking advantage of Thurman and states his disapproval of Willie's sex addiction when Willie makes a rude remark about Thurman's grandmother.\n\nGin visits Roger, who indirectly reveals that Willie is staying with Thurman illegally. Gin confronts Willie and Marcus at the mall, and takes them to a bar. There, he reveals that he has figured out their plan, and blackmails them for half the score to keep silent. Willie and Marcus\u2019 partnership begins to falter, further exacerbated when Willie shows up to work drunk and destroys the Santa attraction, to Marcus' and Gin's shock.\n\nWillie attempts suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes. He gives Thurman a letter to give to the police, confessing his misdeeds and the heist planned for [[Christmas Eve]]. Willie notices Thurman's black eye, and abandons the suicide attempt to confront the skateboarders; he assaults their leader, intimidating them to leave Thurman alone.\n\nFurious at Gin's blackmail, Marcus and Lois set a trap for him. Feigning the need to jump-start their van, Lois hits Gin with the car, Marcus incapacitates him via electrocution and then kills him by crushing him up against his [[Chevrolet Avalanche]] with their van. Willie and Thurman prepare for the approaching holiday with help from Sue. On [[Christmas Eve]], Willie, Marcus, and Lois burglarize the mall. Although some technical difficulties arise, Willie is successfully able to crack the safe.  Meanwhile, he also gets a pink stuffed elephant that Thurman had wanted for Christmas.  However, Marcus reveals to Willie that he intends to kill him, fed up with his increasing carelessness.  As Marcus is about to execute Willie, the police unexpectedly swarm in, tipped off by the letter Willie gave Thurman.  A firefight ensues between Marcus and the cops while Willie flees. Determined to give Thurman his present, he leads the police on a chase to Thurman's house, ignoring their orders to freeze. He is shot repeatedly on Thurman's porch but survives.\n\nThe epilogue is told through a letter from Willie, recovering in the hospital. He expresses his gratitude to Thurman and reveals that he was cleared of the robbery\u2014the shooting of an unarmed Santa embarrassed the police\u2014and will be working for the police as a sensitivity counselor. Sue is granted guardianship over Thurman and his house until his father's release. Marcus and Lois are in prison; Willie ends the letter by hoping that Roger will avoid them and telling Thurman that he should be out of the hospital soon and to be ready for his return. When the lead skateboard bully harasses Thurman again, Thurman finally stands up to him by kicking him hard in the crotch and riding away on his bike giving [[the finger]] to the downed bully.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Willie T.

Afterward, Ficarra and Requa completed what they described as a \"really crass script\", with the Coens adding \"a bunch of crass jokes\".<ref name=\"fretts\"/> When the script's final draft was sent to [[Universal Pictures]], the studio rejected it because \"[I]t was the foulest, disgusting, misogynistic, anti-Christmas, anti-children thing we could imagine,\" all of which influenced [[Bob Weinstein]] of [[Miramax]] to give it the [[green-light]].<ref name=\" fretts\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n\nThe Coens initially tailored roles for specific actors, such as [[James Gandolfini]] as Willie (since they had worked with him on ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]''), [[Danny Woodburn]] as Marcus, and [[Angus T. Jones]] as Thurman.<ref name=\" fretts\"/>  [[Bill Murray]], [[Jack Nicholson]], and [[Robert De Niro]] were also considered for the role of Willie, but it eventually went to Billy Bob Thornton. Zwigoff cast Tony Cox for the role of Marcus and Brett Kelly for Thurman, which led to disagreements between himself and the producers.<ref name=\"fretts\"/> Upon learning of Cox's casting, the Coens told Weinstein that they \"hate\" him, and according to Zwigoff, Dimension was pining for \"a more Disney-like generic cute kid\" to play Thurman. \"Maybe there are other actors who could do a great job with these parts. But Tony and Brett are just funny. They are these characters,\" explained Zwigoff.<ref name=\"fretts\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n\nThe movie was filmed in various parts of [[California]]. Filming began on July 8, 2002, and ended in September 2002. The \"Miami Beach\" sequence at the beginning of the movie was filmed in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], while all of the scenes at Thurman's house were filmed in [[West Hills, California|West Hills]]. All of the Saguaro Square Mall scenes were filmed entirely in the northeastern wing of [[Del Amo Fashion Center]] in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], particularly in the former [[Montgomery Ward]] building, which was used for the mall's fictional anchor store, \"Chamberlain's.\" The store and the entire wing were both vacant at the time of the movie's filming.
