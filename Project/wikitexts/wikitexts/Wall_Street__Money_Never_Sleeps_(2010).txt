It stars [[Michael Douglas]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Carey Mulligan]], [[Frank Langella]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Eli Wallach]] in his final movie role.\n\nThe film takes place in New York City, 23 years after the original, and revolves around the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|2008 financial crisis]]. Its plot centers on a supposedly reformed [[Gordon Gekko]], played by Douglas, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie (Mulligan), with the help of her fianc\u00e9, Jacob Moore (LaBeouf).\n\nPrincipal photography took place in [[New York City]] between September and November 2009. After having its release date moved twice, ''Money Never Sleeps'' was released theatrically worldwide on September 24, 2010, by [[20th Century Fox]]. Prior to its official release, many journalists connected to the financial industry were reportedly shown advance screenings of the film.\n\nDespite opening to positive reception at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''Money Never Sleeps'' received mixed reviews from critics. Though failing to meet its critical expectations, the film was successful at the [[box office]], topping the United States's ranking during its opening weekend, and earning a worldwide total of $134 million in ticket sales, and more than $15 million on DVD.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, former [[corporate raid]]er [[Gordon Gekko]] is released from prison after serving time for [[insider trading]] and [[securities fraud]].\n\nBy 2008, Gekko has begun promoting his new book ''Is Greed Good?'', warning about a [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|coming economic downturn]]. His estranged daughter, Winnie, runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob \"Jake\" Moore, a top [[Proprietary trading|prop trader]] at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jake, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of KZI managing director Louis Zabel, has been raising money for Dr. Masters and his [[Fusion power|fusion]] research project, which might create abundant [[clean energy]]. Jake is also financially assisting his mother, Sylvia, who has quit nursing to speculate in residential real estate.\n\nIn the early stages of the downturn predicted by Gekko, KZI's stock loses more than half its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other [[Wall Street]] banks, but is blocked by Bretton James, head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz (Church), which KZI had refused to help during the [[dot-com bubble]] years earlier. Despondent, Zabel commits suicide by jumping in front of a [[New York City Subway|subway train]]. A distraught Jake proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts.\n\nJake attends a lecture given by Gekko and introduces himself. Gekko tells him that KZI's collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having [[toxic debt]]. Jake and Gekko arrange a trade: Jake will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally [[market manipulation|manipulates the market]] by spreading rumors about the nationalization of an [[Equatorial Guinea]] oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors to invest in the fusion project through Church.\n\nJake attends a $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to facilitate a \"chance\" meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]), who, following his release from jail, turned Bluestar Airlines into a huge success, sold it for millions, and retired from business to play golf and become a philanthropist. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.\n\nAs the financial crisis accelerates, Bretton and Church's chairman Julius Steinhardt advise [[Federal Reserve System|federal regulators]] to buy their multi-billion-dollar [[subprime loans]]. As real estate collapses, Jake helps out Sylvia with his own money. Shortly after Winnie informs Jake that she is expecting their first child, Jake learns that Bretton is diverting the Chinese investment into underperforming solar panels, which are not a threat to his large position in fossil fuels. Gekko soon informs Jake that Bretton had secretly made huge profits betting against subprime loans yet still accepted the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|feds massive bailout]].\n\nGekko proposes using a $100 million [[Trust law|trust fund]] account, which he hid in Switzerland for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the fusion research. She signs the money over to Jake, not knowing he would entrust it to Gekko to complete the investment. When Gekko betrays them by leaving the country with the money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in [[London]], capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchild's life. Gekko refuses.\n\nJake pieces together all the details of Bretton's dealings, from KZI's collapse through to the unnecessary government bailout of Bretton's company. He gives the information to Winnie, telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. When Winnie runs the story, Bretton finds himself under intense government scrutiny and is fired by his company's board, who then turn to Gekko's firm for a partnership, which recently posted a $1.1 billion return on investment.\n\nLate one night, when Jake fails to make amends with Winnie, Gekko appears, apologizes and tells them that he has anonymously deposited $100 million into the fusion research account, convincing her to give both him and Jake another chance. One year later, Gekko, Sylvia, and other family and friends attend the first birthday party of Louis, Jake and Winnie's son.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Gordon Gekko]]\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Jacob \"Jake\" Moore\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Bretton James\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Winnie Gekko\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sylvia Moore\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Julius \"Julie\" Steinhardt\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Louis \"Lou\" Zabel\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Dr. Masters\n* [[Sylvia Miles]] as Dolores, The Realtor\n* [[Vanessa Ferlito]] as Audrey\n* [[John Buffalo Mailer]] as Robby\n* [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] as New York Fed Chief\n* [[Oliver Stone]] as Investor\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Bud \"Buddy\" Fox\n* [[Donald Trump]] as Himself (deleted scene)<ref>{{cite web |title=Oliver Stone Cut a Donald Trump Cameo From One of His Films, Says Hollywood is 'A Factory' |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/oliver-stone-donald-trump-cameo-wall-street-money-never-sleeps-deleted-scene-1201857004/ |website=Variety.com |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Anthony Scaramucci]] as Himself<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schuster |first1=Dana |title=Scaramucci's fed-up wife filed for divorce while nine months pregnant |url=http://pagesix.com/2017/07/29/scaramuccis-fed-up-wife-filed-for-divorce-while-nine-months-pregnant/?_ga=2.20708472.1575572099.1501452596-566168642.1501452596 |website=New York Post |date=July 29, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Maria Bartiromo]] as Herself, Newscaster Cameo\n* [[Rebecca Quick|Becky Quick]] as Herself, ''[[Squawk Box]]'' Host Cameo\n* [[Jim Cramer]] as Cameo Appearance\n* [[Ali Velshi]] as Cameo Appearance\n* Waltrudis Buck as Annica <ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bbc9b51c7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410061432/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bbc9b51c7|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 April 2015|title=Waltrudis Buck|work=BFI|access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Michael Douglas Cannes 2010.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Douglas at the film's premiere at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n[[Michael Douglas]] reprises his role as [[Gordon Gekko]], which won him an [[Academy Award]] after the original film.
