Lynch also created its [[Eraserhead (soundtrack)|score]] and [[sound design]], which included pieces by a variety of other musicians. Shot in [[black and white]], it was Lynch's first feature-length effort following several short films. Starring [[Jack Nance]], [[Charlotte Stewart]], [[Jeanne Bates]], [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Anna Roberts]], Laurel Near, and [[Jack Fisk]], it tells the story of a man who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape.\n\n''Eraserhead'' was produced with the assistance of the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) during Lynch's time studying there. It nonetheless spent several years in [[principal photography]] because of funding difficulties; donations from Fisk and his wife [[Sissy Spacek]] kept production afloat. It was shot on several locations owned by the AFI in [[California]], including [[Greystone Mansion]] and a set of disused stables in which Lynch lived. Lynch and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] spent a year working on the film's audio after their studio was soundproofed. The soundtrack features organ music by [[Fats Waller]] and includes the song \"[[In Heaven]]\", written and performed for the film by [[Peter Ivers]], with lyrics by Lynch.\n\nInitially opening to small audiences and little interest, ''Eraserhead'' gained popularity over several long runs as a [[midnight movie]]. Since its release, it has earned positive reviews and is considered a [[cult film]]. Its surrealist imagery and sexual undercurrents have been seen as key thematic elements, and its intricate [[sound design]] as its technical highlight. In 2004, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States  [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"2004Add\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe Man in the Planet ([[Jack Fisk]]) is moving levers in his home in space, while the head of Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]]) floats in the sky. A [[spermatozoon]]-like creature emerges from Spencer's mouth, floating into the void.\n\nIn an industrial cityscape, Spencer walks home with his groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall ([[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Anna Roberts]]), who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary&nbsp;X ([[Charlotte Stewart]]), has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead vegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother. At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken that X's father has \"made\"; the bird moves and writhes on the plate and gushes blood when cut. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother, who tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child and that the two must marry. X, however, is not sure if what she bore is a child.\n\nThe couple move into Spencer's one-room apartment and begin caring for the child\u2014a swaddled bundle with an inhuman, snake-like face, resembling the spermatozoon-like creature seen earlier. The infant refuses all food, crying incessantly and intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the child. Spencer attempts to care for the child, and he learns that it struggles to breathe and has developed painful sores.\n\nSpencer begins experiencing visions, again seeing the Man in the Planet, as well as the Lady in the Radiator ([[Laurel Near]]), who sings to him as she stomps upon miniature replicas of Spencer's child. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has another vision: the Lady in the Radiator sings (\"In Heaven Everything Is Fine\") as Spencer watches his own head fall off, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Spencer's head falls from the sky, landing on a street and breaking open. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.\n\nAwakened, Spencer seeks out the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer returns to his room. He takes a pair of scissors and for the first time removes the child's swaddling clothes. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer stabs its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads, causing the lights to flicker; as they flick on and off the child grows to huge proportions. As the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet seen at the beginning. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and [[white noise]] build to a crescendo before the screen turns black and silent.\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Kafka.jpg\n| width1    = 188\n| alt1      = A black-and-white full-length picture of a man in a suit\n| image2    = N.Gogol by F.Moller (early 1840s, Ivanovo) detail.jpg\n| width2    = 168\n| alt2      = A painted portrait of a moustached man\n| footer = Stories by [[Franz Kafka]] ''(left)'' and [[Nikolai Gogol]] ''(right)'' influenced ''Eraserhead''{{'s}} script.\n}}\nWriter and director [[David Lynch]] had previously studied for a career as a painter, and he had created several short films to animate his paintings.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=192\u20136}} By 1970, however, he had switched his focus to film-making, and at the age of 24 he accepted a scholarship at the [[American Film Institute]]'s Center for Advanced Film Studies. Lynch disliked the course and considered dropping out, but after being offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising, he changed his mind. He was given permission to use the school's entire campus for film sets; he converted the school's disused stables into a series of sets and lived there.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=27}} In addition, [[Greystone Mansion]], also owned by the AFI, was used for many scenes.<ref name=\"dark lens\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/magazine/a-dark-lens-on-america.html |title=A Dark Lens on America |work=[[The New York Times]]  |date= January 14, 1990 |first=Richard B. |last=Woodward |access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nLynch had initially begun work on a script titled ''Gardenback'', based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. ''Gardenback'' was a surrealist script about adultery, which featured a continually growing insect representing one man's lust for his neighbor. The script would have resulted in a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script.{{sfn|Olson|2008|pp=56\u201359}} In its place, Lynch presented ''Eraserhead'', which he had developed based on a daydream of a man's head being taken to a pencil factory by a small boy. Several board members at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but they acquiesced when Dean [[Frank Daniel]] threatened to resign if it were to be vetoed.{{sfn|Olson|2008|pp=59\u201360}} Lynch's script for ''Eraserhead'' was influenced by his reading as a film student; [[Franz Kafka]]'s 1915 novella ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' and [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s 1836 short story \"[[The Nose (Gogol short story)|The Nose]]\" were strong influences on the screenplay.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=54}} Lynch also confirmed in an interview with ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'' that the film \"came together\" when he opened up a [[Bible]], read one verse from it, and shut it; in retrospect, Lynch could not remember if the verse was from the [[Old Testament]] or the [[New Testament]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/01.17.07/david-lynch-interview-0703.html |title=Diving In |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]  |first=Richard |last=von Busack |access-date=February 25, 2017}}</ref> In 2007, Lynch said \"Believe it or not, ''Eraserhead'' is my most spiritual film.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bafta.org/media-centre/transcripts/bafta-television-lecture-david-lynch |title=David Lean Lecture: David Lynch |work=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]  |date=October 27, 2007|access-date=February 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe script is also thought to have been inspired by Lynch's fear of fatherhood;<ref name=\"dark lens\"/> his daughter [[Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer]] had been born with \"severely [[clubbed feet]]\", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=87}} Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=87}} The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in [[Philadelphia]]. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of \"violence, hate and filth\".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=51}} The area was described as a \"crime-ridden poverty zone\", which inspired the urban backdrop of ''Eraserhead''. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said, \"I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe&nbsp;... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back\".<ref name=\"dark lens\"/> In his book ''David Lynch: Beautiful Dark'', film critic Greg Olson posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [[Pacific Northwest]], giving the director a \"bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America\" which has subsequently shaped his films.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=51}}\n\nInitial casting for the film began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly selected for the lead role. However, the staff at the AFI had underestimated the project's scale\u2014they had initially [[Greenlight|green-lit]] ''Eraserhead'' after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=27}} In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door\u2014a full year passed before he was filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n===Filming===\nBuoyed with regular donations from Lynch's childhood friend Jack Fisk and Fisk's wife [[Sissy Spacek]], production continued for several years.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=28}} Additional funds were provided by Nance's wife [[Catherine E. Coulson]], who worked as a waitress and donated her income,{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=67}} and by Lynch himself, who delivered newspapers throughout the film's principal photography.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=60}} During one of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch|The Amputee]]'', taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=28\u201329}} The short piece starred Coulson, who continued working with Lynch as a technician on ''Eraserhead''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=28\u201329}} ''Eraserhead''{{'s}} production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; [[sound design]]er [[Alan Splet]]; [[cinematography|cinematographer]] Herb Cardwell, who left the production for financial reasons and was replaced with [[Frederick Elmes]]; production manager and prop technician Doreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=55}}\n\n[[File:Eraserhead baby.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of the film, showing the bizarre animal-like infant|It has been speculated that Lynch used a rabbit to create Spencer's alien-like baby.]]\n\nThe physical effects used to create the deformed child have been kept secret. The projectionist who worked on the film's [[dailies]] was blindfolded by Lynch to avoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|pp=242\u2013243}} The prop\u2014which Nance nicknamed \"Spike\"\u2014featured several working parts; its neck, eyes and mouth were capable of independent operation.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=35\u201336}} Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that \"it was born nearby\" or \"maybe it was found\".{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=54}} It has been speculated by ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} John Patterson that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus.<ref name=\"guardian baby\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/06/davidlynch |title=Film: David Lynch's film has scarred many an innocent viewer, including a teenage John Patterson |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=John |last=Patterson |date=September 6, 2008 |access-date=August 24, 2012}}</ref> The child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s make-up in 1980's ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' and the [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] of 1984's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''.<ref name=\"nyt rev\"/>\n\nDuring production, Lynch began experimenting with a technique of recording dialogue that had been spoken phonetically backwards and reversing the resulting audio. Although the technique was not used in the film, Lynch returned to it for \"[[Episode 2 (Twin Peaks)|Episode&nbsp;2]]\", the third episode of his 1990 television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|pp=165\u2013167}} Lynch also began his interest in [[transcendental meditation]] during the film's production,<ref name=\"dark lens\"/> adopting a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]] and giving up smoking and alcohol.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=72}}\n\n===Post-production===\nLynch worked with Alan Splet to design the film's sound. The pair arranged and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=234}} Sounds were created in a variety of ways\u2014for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, [[reverb]] and frequency.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nAfter a poorly received [[test screening]], in which Lynch believes he had mixed the soundtrack at too high a volume, the director cut twenty minutes of footage from the film, bringing its length to 89 minutes.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=235}} Among the cut footage is a scene featuring Coulson as the infant's midwife, another of a man torturing two women\u2014one again played by Coulson\u2014with a car battery, and one of Spencer toying with a dead cat.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=34}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Eraserhead (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Eraserhead'' was released by [[I.R.S.

Although the film features several hallmark visuals\u2014the deformed infant and the sprawling industrial setting\u2014these are matched by their accompanying sounds, as the \"incessant mewling\" and \"evocative aural landscape\" are paired with these respectively.<ref name=\"scenic route\">{{cite web |url=https://avclub.com/articles/david-lynch-shows-how-audio-can-be-creepier-than-a,73926/ |title=David Lynch shows how audio can be creepier than any image in Eraserhead |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |publisher=[[The Onion]] |first=Mike |last=D'Angelo |date=May 14, 2012 |access-date=August 22, 2012}}</ref> The film features several constant industrial sounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. This fosters a \"threatening\" and \"unnerving\" atmosphere, which has been imitated in works such as [[David Fincher]]'s 1995 thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and the [[Coen brothers]]' 1991 black comedy ''[[Barton Fink]]''.<ref name=\"scenic route\"/> The constant low-level noise has been perceived by James Wierzbicki in his book ''Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in Cinema'' as perhaps a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, and the soundtrack has been described as \"ruthlessly negligent of the difference between dream and reality\".{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2012|p=182}} The film also begins a trend within Lynch's work of relating [[diegesis|diegetic]] music to dreams, as when the Lady in the Radiator sings \"In Heaven\" during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also present in \"Episode 2\" of ''Twin Peaks'', in which diegetic music carries over from a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', in which a similar focus is given to [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\".{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2012|p=182}}\n\nThe film has also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a character who is terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; the apparent \"[[girl next door]]\" appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=32}} In his book ''The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror'', [[David J. Skal]] describes the film as \"depict[ing] human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned\".{{sfn|Skal|2001|p=298}} Skal also posits a different characterization of the Lady in the Radiator, casting her as \"desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval\".{{sfn|Skal|2001|p=298}} In his book ''David Lynch Decoded'', Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's [[subconscious]], a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after he does so, as if to reassure him that he has done right.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=7}}\n\nAs a character, Spencer has been seen as an [[everyman]] figure, his blank expression and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=62}} Spencer displays a [[pacifism|pacifistic]] and [[fatalism|fatalistic]] inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by the domineering and controlling influences that beset him. Spencer's passivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983\u201392 comic strip ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=33}}\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Eraserhead'' premiered at the [[Filmex]] film festival in [[Los Angeles]], on March 19, 1977.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=215}} On its opening night, the film was attended by twenty-five people; twenty-four viewed it the following evening.
