They find him in a saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, but cannot fight due to the presence of Sheriff [[Wyatt Earp]]. Lin enters the town's Centennial shooting contest for a prized [[Winchester 1873]] rifle. Lin wins and goes to his room at the boarding house to pack. There, Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle, and rides away with two cohorts.\n \nArriving at Riker's Bar, they find Native American trader Joe Lamont, who sees the prize Winchester and becomes determined to own it. He raises the price of his guns and ammunition supply so high that Dutch and his men cannot afford to buy any. Dutch's only option is to trade the rifle for Lamont's three hundred dollars in gold plus their pick of weapons. Dutch makes the trade and tries to get the rifle back by gambling the three hundred in a poker game against Lamont, but loses.\n\nLamont takes his guns to meet Native American buyers, but their leader Young Bull prefers the prize Winchester. When Lamont refuses to sell it, he is robbed and scalped.\n\n[[File:Winchester73 trailer Stewart.png|thumb|Stewart shooting in the rifle contest.]]\n\nMeanwhile, former saloon girl Lola is in a wagon with her fianc\u00e9 Steve Miller traveling toward a new home. Pursued by Young Bull and his warriors, they realize that they will not be able to outrun them. Panicking, Steve jumps on his horse and rides off to find help. Not far ahead, Steve finds a small encampment of soldiers and leads them back to rescue Lola. Lin and Wilson, chased by the same Native Americans, also ride into the encampment that night.\n\nThe soldiers are new to the territory. Lin gives their sergeant tactical advice on fighting Native Americans and they prepare for an attack expected early the next morning. After a fierce battle in which Young Bull is killed, the Native Americans leave, while Lin and High-Spade depart to continue searching for Dutch. Unknowingly, they ride past the prize Winchester where Young Bull had dropped it when he fell. It is found by a trooper and the Sergeant gives it to Steve.\n\n[[File:Winchester73 trailer Stewart Winters.png|left|thumb|Shelley Winters accepting Stewart's revolver during the Native American attack.]]\n\nSteve and Lola reach the Jameson house, which is set to become theirs. He wants her to stay with the Jamesons while he goes to meet outlaw Waco Johnnie Dean, but Waco and his men arrive unexpectedly, chased by a posse that surrounds the house. Once Waco sees the prize Winchester, he too covets it. He provokes Steve into a gunfight and kills him. Waco and Lola escape the posse and ride to Dutch's hideout. Dutch claims the rifle is his and forces Waco to return it.\n\nThe gang goes to [[Tascosa, Texas]] to commit a robbery. They are joined by Lin and Wilson. Waco attempts to shoot Lin and is killed, while around them the robbery goes awry and Lola is wounded. Wilson reveals to Lola that Dutch is Lin's brother and that Dutch had robbed a bank and a stagecoach and returned to the family home hoping to hide out. When their father refused to help him, Dutch shot him in the back and Lin has sworn revenge.\n\nLin confronts Dutch on a rocky hill and calls him by his real name, Matthew. They shoot it out on the hill and Lin kills him with the Winchester.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Winchester73 trailer Stewart 2.png|thumb|Stewart during the Native American attack]]\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Stewart]] as Lin McAdam\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Lola Manners\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Johnnie \"Waco Johnnie\" Dean\n* [[Stephen McNally]] as Henry \"Dutch Henry\" Brown\n* [[Millard Mitchell]] as Frankie \"High-Spade Frankie\" Wilson\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Steve Miller\n* [[John McIntire]] as Joe Lamont\n* [[Will Geer]] as [[Wyatt Earp]]\n* [[Jay C.

Flippen]]\n\nThe film was originally intended to have been directed by [[Fritz Lang]]<ref>Munn, Michael (2007). ''Jimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend''. Robson, p. 198.</ref> but Universal did not want Lang to produce the film through his own Diana Productions company.<ref>Lang, Fritz, and Barry Keith Grant (2003). ''Fritz Lang''. University Press of Mississippi, p. 57.{{ISBN?}}</ref> Lang's idea was to have the rifle being Stewart's character's only source of strength and his only excuse for living, making the quest for his rifle a matter of life and death.<ref>Lang 2003, p. 57.</ref> With Lang out of the picture, Universal produced the film itself with the up-and-coming Anthony Mann, who was James Stewart's choice, directing.  Mann had [[Borden Chase]] rewrite the script <ref>Basinger, Jeanine (2007). ''Anthony Mann''. Wesleyan University Press, p. 79.</ref> to make the rifle [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bone_of_contention a ''bone of contention''] instead, showing it passing contentiously through the hands of a variety of people.\n\nStewart had wished to make ''[[Harvey (1950 film)|Harvey]]'' for Universal-International but, when the studio wouldn't pay the $200,000 salary he wanted, studio head [[William Goetz]] offered to allow Stewart to make both ''Harvey'' and ''Winchester '73'' for a percentage of the profits, spread over some time and at a lower [[capital gain|capital gain tax]] rate than a single payment to Stewart would be.<ref>Eyman, Scott (2005). ''The Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer''. Robson, p. 456.</ref><ref>Basinger 2007, p. 79.</ref> Stewart's then-agent [[Lew Wasserman]] was able to get his client 50% of the profits, eventually amounting to $600,000 from the film's unexpected success.<ref>McDonald, Paul (2000).

''Hollywood Independents: The Postwar Talent Takeover''. University of Minnesota Press, p. 51.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nStewart was already cast in the part of Lin McAdam and spent a lot of time practicing with the rifle so he would look like an authentic Westerner. As Mann later related, \"[Stewart] was magnificent walking down a street with a Winchester rifle cradled in his arm. And he was great too actually firing the gun. He studied hard at it. His knuckles were raw with practicing... It was those sorts of things that helped make the film look so authentic, gave it its sense of reality.\" An expert marksman from the Winchester company, Herb Parsons, did the trick shooting required for the film and assisted Stewart in his training.\n\n[[Shelley Winters]] was cast as a dance-hall girl. Winters didn't understand the film, nor think much of her part in it, saying, \"Here you've got all these men... running around to get their hands on this goddamn rifle instead of going after a beautiful blonde like me. What does that tell you about the values of that picture? If I hadn't been in it, would anybody have noticed?\"\n\nThe part of [[Wyatt Earp]] was given to [[Will Geer]], who was not alone in feeling he was miscast for the role. [[Millard Mitchell]] was cast as High-Spade Frankie Wilson. That same year, Mitchell appeared in ''[[The Gunfighter]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]]. He would appear in another Stewart-Mann western, ''[[The Naked Spur]]'' (1953), as a grizzled old prospector.\n\n[[Jay C. Flippen]] appeared as cavalry sergeant Wilkes. He would also appear in the second Stewart-Mann Western, ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952), along with [[Rock Hudson]], who appears in ''Winchester '73'' as a Native American.\n\nThe Stewart and Mann collaboration established a new [[persona]] for Stewart, more violent and disillusioned than ever before, but still likable.<ref>Basinger 2007, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Locations===\n''Winchester '73'' was filmed at:\n*Mescal, Arizona, US\n*Old Tucson, 201 S.

The winner of the contest received a new [[Winchester Model 1894]] rifle since the Model 1873 was out of production at that time.<ref>Gordon, James D. ''Winchester's New Model of 1873: A Tribute''. Self-published, 1997, p. 391.</ref>\n\nThe film was a financial success, turning a significant profit.  It has gained a reputation as a classic of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre since and durably helped to redefine the public perception of [[James Stewart]].\n\nContemporary critics are enthusiastic.  Writing for the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'', Martin Chilton gave the movie 5 stars and described the film as \"the first in a series of Western masterpieces\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11466703/Winchester-73-review.html|title=Winchester '73, review}}</ref> In ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', William Thomas calls the film \"the marvellously-scripted story of a man and a gun\".
