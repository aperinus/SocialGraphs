Adapted by [[Robert Riskin]] from the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[You Can't Take It with You (play)|1936 play of the same name]] by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart]],<ref>{{ibdb show|9527|You Can't Take It With You}}</ref> the film is about a man from a family of rich snobs who becomes engaged to a woman from a good-natured but decidedly eccentric family.\n\nA critical and commercial success, the film received two [[Academy Awards]] from seven nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[Frank Capra]]. This was Capra's third Oscar for Best Director in just five years, following ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) and ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936).\n\n==Plot==\nA successful banker, Anthony P. Kirby ([[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]]), has just returned from [[Washington, D.C.]], where he was effectively granted a government-sanctioned [[munitions]] [[monopoly]], which will make him very rich. He intends to buy up a 12-block radius around a competitor's factory to put him out of business, but there is one house that is a holdout to selling. Kirby instructs his real estate broker, John Blakely ([[Clarence Wilson (actor)|Clarence Wilson]]), to offer a huge sum for the house, and if that is not accepted, to cause trouble for the family. Meanwhile, Grandpa Vanderhof ([[Lionel Barrymore]]) convinces a banker named Poppins to pursue his dream of making animated toys.\n\nKirby's son, Tony ([[James Stewart]]), a vice president in the family company, has fallen in love with a company [[stenographer]], Alice Sycamore ([[Jean Arthur]]). When Tony proposes marriage, Alice is worried that her family would be looked upon poorly by Tony's rich and famous family. In fact, Alice is the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Vanderhof. Unbeknownst to the players, Alice's family lives in the house that will not sell out.\n\nKirby and his wife ([[Mary Forbes]]) strongly disapprove of Tony's choice for marriage. Before she accepts, Alice forces Tony to bring his family to become better acquainted with their future in-laws. But when Tony purposely brings his family on the wrong day (reasoning that he would rather the two families meet as they are, not in a formal 'stuff-shirt' setting), the Sycamore family is caught off-guard and the house is in disarray. As the Kirbys are preparing to leave after a rather disastrous meeting, the police arrive in response to what they perceive as printed threats on flyers by Grandpa's son in law, Ed Carmichael. When the fireworks in the basement go off, they arrest everyone in the house.\n\nHeld up in the [[drunk tank]] preparing to see the night court judge, Mrs. Kirby repeatedly insults Alice and makes her feel unworthy of her son, while Grandpa explains to Kirby the importance of having friends and that despite all the wealth and success in business, \"you can't take it with you\". At the court hearing, the judge ([[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]]) allows for Grandpa and his family to settle the charges for disturbing the peace and making illegal fireworks by assessing a fine, which Grandpa's neighborhood friends pitch in to pay for. He repeatedly asks why the Kirbys were at the Vanderhof house. When Grandpa, attempting to help Kirby, says it was to talk over selling the house, Alice has an outburst and says it was because she was engaged to Tony but is spurning him because of how poorly she has been treated by his family. This causes a sensation in the papers, and Alice flees the city.\n\nWith Alice gone, Grandpa decides to sell the house, thus meaning the whole section of the town must vacate in preparation for building a new factory. Now, the Kirby companies merge, creating a huge fluctuation in the stock market. When Kirby's competitor, Ramsey ([[H. B. Warner]]), dies after confronting him for being ruthless and a failure of a man, Kirby has a realization he is heading for the same fate, and decides to leave the meeting where the signing of the contracts is to take place.\n\nAs the Vanderhofs are moving out of the house, Tony tries to track down Alice. Kirby arrives and talks privately with Grandpa, sharing his realization. Grandpa responds by inviting him to play \"[[Polly Wolly Doodle]]\" on the harmonica that he gave him. The two let loose with the rest of the family joining in the merriment, and with Alice taking Tony back. Later, at the dinner table, Grandpa says grace for the Sycamore family and the Kirbys, revealing that Kirby has sold back the houses on the block.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Jean Arthur]] as Alice Sycamore\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Grandpa Martin Vanderhof\n* [[James Stewart]] as Tony Kirby\n* [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] as Anthony P.
