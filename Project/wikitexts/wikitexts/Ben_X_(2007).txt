The film was the Belgian entry for the [[80th Academy Awards|Academy Awards 2007]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] but failed to receive the actual nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenage Ben is frequently bullied at school. To escape his harsh reality, he turns to a virtual world by playing an online game, ''[[ArchLord]]''. In the game, he is a confident and brave hero. Moreover, he collaborates his adventures with another online user known in-game as Scarlite.\n\nOne day, Ben is being bullied again. During the class break, the bullies drag Ben on top of a table and pull his pants down, while classmates record the incident on their phones. With cruel remarks and teasing from his classmates, Ben becomes so humiliated and frustrated that he smashes the window with a chair. Ben is immediately sent to the headmaster's office, where the headmaster asks Ben to explain the incident. Ben, however, does not speak at all, leaving the issue unresolved. After that scene, it's revealed that Ben has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], a form of [[autism]]. Things gets worse for Ben as the class incident gets posted on the internet. Feeling distraught about his life in general, Ben is even ready to leave his virtual world behind, where he tells Scarlite that he is ready to \"endgame\". Concerned, Scarlite sends a video message to Ben X (as Scarlite has no idea what Ben looks like) saying that there cannot be an endgame, unless there is a healer. Scarlite then tells Ben to meet her at the train station.\n\nAt the train station, Ben sees Scarlite, but does not go to her. Scarlite, assuming that Ben did not show up at all, goes to the train. Ben follows Scarlite onto the train and sits next to her, feeling nervous and excited at the same time. Just as the train approaches [[Brussels]], Scarlite asks Ben if he is all right. Ben does not reply and goes off, leaving Scarlite behind. Having not talked to Scarlite, Ben was contemplating suicide by jumping off the platform. As Ben was ready to jump, he is pulled back and it's revealed that it's Scarlite who did so. She later tells Ben that he can choose to either give up and take his own life or take revenge and fight, just like he would in Archlord. But, to make the decision, he needs to devise a plan.\n\nBen (with Scarlite) asks his parents to help. He has decided to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off the ferry. He does so, and captures the suicide on tape. Afterwards, a [[funeral]] was held for Ben, with everybody, including the bullies being present. As the funeral went on, the video then changes to Ben and his speech (which seems like a suicide note video). In the video, the bullies are exposed (as well as the classmates involved) of what they have done to Ben that day of the incident. Then, to everyone's shock, it was revealed that Ben is alive, by his shadow seen over the video and Ben being seen from the projecting room. It turns out that Ben had chosen to take revenge on the bullies by faking his own suicide. It was revealed that as he jumped off the ferry, his parents had caught him at the lower deck, as part of the plan.\n\nAfterwards, Ben, Scarlite, his mother, and his brother are at a horse ranch in the country. The horse instructor shows Ben how to be friendly with the horse and tells him that \"You must learn to feel, in order to feel good\". Ben touches the horse gently, just as the instructor told him and feels happy. Ben then goes to Scarlite and talks to her. The horse instructor looks baffled, as it is revealed that Ben is actually talking to himself. Ben's mother then tells the horse instructor that everything is fine and Ben is happy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Greg Timmermans]] as Ben\n* [[Laura Verlinden]] as Scarlite\n* [[Marijke Pinoy]] as Ben's mother\n* [[Cesar De Sutte]]r as Jonas\n* [[Pol Goossen]] as Ben's father\n* [[Titus de Voogdt]] as Bogaert\n* [[Maarten Claeyssens]] as Desmedt\n* [[Tania Van der Sanden]] as Sabine\n* [[Peter De Graef]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Ron Cornet]] as Headmaster\n* [[Johan Heldenbergh]] as Religion Teacher\n* [[Jakob Beks]] as Metallurgy Teacher\n* [[Gilles De Schryver]] as Coppola\n* [[Dirk Van Dicjk]] as Policeman 1\n\n==Remake==\n\n[[Erik Leijonborg]] adapted the film into a Swedish-language remake, ''[[IRL (film)|IRL]]''.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nThe film was adapted into a graphic novel, drawn by NDurlie,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cobra.canvas.be/cm/cobra/boek/1.2290483|title = Canvas: (Her)bekijk je favoriete programma's: Actua, docu en series}}</ref> the pseudonym of Veerle Colle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/colle_veerle.htm|title=Veerle Colle|website=lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
