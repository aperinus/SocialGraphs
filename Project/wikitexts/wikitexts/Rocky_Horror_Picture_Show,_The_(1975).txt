The screenplay was written by Sharman and actor [[Richard O'Brien]], who is also a member of the cast. The film is based on the 1973 [[Musical theatre|musical stage production]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', with music, book, and lyrics by O'Brien. The production is a tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and horror [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s. Along with O'Brien, the film stars [[Tim Curry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Barry Bostwick]] and is narrated by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], with cast members from the original [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]], and [[Belasco Theatre]] productions, including [[Nell Campbell]] and [[Patricia Quinn (Northern Irish actress)|Patricia Quinn]].\n\nThe story centres on a young engaged couple whose car breaks down in the rain near a castle, where they seek a telephone to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover the head of the house is [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]], an apparently [[mad scientist]] who actually is an alien [[Transvestism|transvestite]] from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania, who creates a living muscle man named Rocky in his laboratory.\n\nThe film was shot in the United Kingdom at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and on location at an old country estate named [[Oakley Court]], best known for its earlier use by [[Hammer Film Productions]]. A number of [[Theatrical property|props]] and set pieces were reused from the Hammer horror films. Although the film is both a parody of and tribute to many [[kitsch]] science fiction and horror films, costume designer [[Sue Blane]] conducted no research for her designs. Blane has claimed that her creations for the film directly affected the development of [[punk fashion|punk rock fashion]] trends, such as torn [[fishnet]] stockings and colourfully dyed hair.<ref name=\"punkblane\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qx6GDAAAQBAJ&q=Sue+blane,+punk+rock&pg=PA1785 |title=The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic |date=1 February 2016 |publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books |isbn=978-1-4950-0747-7 |page=1785 |author-link=Dave Thompson (author)}}</ref>\n\nInitial reception was extremely negative, but it soon became a hit as a [[midnight movie]], when audiences began participating with the film at the [[Waverly Theater]] in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. At almost the same time, fans in costume at the King's Court Theater in Pittsburgh began performing alongside the film. This \"shadow cast\" mimed the actions on screen above and behind them, while lip-syncing their character's lines.\n\nStill in [[limited release]] in {{CURRENTYEAR}}, some {{age|1975|08|15}} years after its premiere, it is the longest-running theatrical release in film history. In many cities, live amateur shadow-casts act out the film as it is being shown and heavily draw upon a tradition of audience participation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nerdnationmagazine.com/2014/09/30/rocky-horror-picture-show-a-how-to-guide-for-audience-participation/ |title=Rocky Horror Picture Show \u2013 a How-To Guide for Audience Participation |date=30 September 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101084155/https://nerdnationmagazine.com/2014/09/30/rocky-horror-picture-show-a-how-to-guide-for-audience-participation/ |archive-date=1 November 2020 |access-date=19 January 2022}}</ref> The film is most often shown close to Halloween. Today, the film has [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|a large international cult following]] and has been considered by many as [[List of films considered the best#Genres or media|one of the greatest musical films of all time]]. In 2005, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a pair of floating disembodied lips welcoming the audience to a [[science fiction]] [[double feature]]. Throughout the film, a [[Criminology|criminologist]] from an unspecified point in the future narrates and provides commentary on the events.\n\nFollowing the wedding of their friends, a na\u00efve young couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss, get engaged and decide to celebrate with their high school science teacher Dr. Scott, who taught the class where they first met. En route to Scott's house on a dark and rainy night, they get lost with a flat tire. Seeking a telephone to call for help, the couple walks to a nearby castle where a party is going on. They are accepted in by the strangely dressed inhabitants, led by the [[butler]] Riff Raff, the [[maid]] Magenta, and a [[groupie]] named Columbia, who dance to \"The Time Warp\". Despite feeling apprehensive, they stay to meet the owner of the castle, Dr. Frank-N-Furter.  He invites them to stay for the night.\n\nWith the help of Riff Raff, Frank brings to life a tall, muscular, handsome blond man named Rocky. As Frank vows he can improve Rocky into an ideal man in a week, a delivery boy named Eddie (half of whose brain Frank had used in the creation of Rocky) breaks out of a deep freeze riding a motorcycle. Frank kills Eddie with a pickaxe, justifying it as a \"[[Euthanasia|mercy killing]]\". Rocky and Frank depart for the bridal suite.\n\nBrad and Janet are shown to separate bedrooms, where each is visited and seduced by Frank. Meanwhile, Riff Raff and his sister Magenta torment Rocky. Janet, upset and emotional, sees Brad smoking a cigarette in bed with Frank on a video monitor. She then discovers Rocky, cowering in his birth tank. While tending to his wounds, Janet seduces Rocky as Magenta and Columbia watch from their bedroom monitor.\n\nDr. Scott, now an investigator of [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] for the government, arrives at the castle in search of his nephew Eddie, unaware of Brad and Janet's presence. Everyone discovers Janet and Rocky together, enraging Frank. At this point, Magenta summons everyone to an uncomfortable dinner, which they soon realise has been prepared from Eddie's mutilated remains. Columbia, Eddie\u2019s lover, flees from the room in tears. Janet runs screaming into Rocky's arms, provoking Frank to chase her through the halls to the lab.\n\nFrank uses his [[Medusa]] Transducer to turn Dr. Scott, Brad, Janet, Rocky and Columbia into nude statues. After dressing them in cabaret costumes, Frank \"unfreezes\" them, and they perform a live cabaret floor show, complete with an [[RKO]] tower and a swimming pool, with Frank as the leader. Riff Raff and Magenta interrupt the performance to declare mutiny; they disapprove of Frank's extreme lifestyle and are ready to return to Transylvania. Frank makes an impassioned plea to return with them, but Riff Raff kills him, as well as Columbia and Rocky. Riff Raff warns Brad, Janet and Dr. Scott to leave immediately; the castle lifts off into space. The injured survivors are then left crawling in the smog and dirt and the criminologist concludes that the human race is equivalent to insects crawling on the planet's surface: \"lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, The Eccentric Transvestite Scientist \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Janet Weiss, The Heroine and Brad's Fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Brad Majors, The Hero and Janet's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Riff Raff, Hunch-Backed Handyman and Magenta's Brother\n* [[Patricia Quinn (Northern Irish actress)|Patricia Quinn]] as Magenta, Maid and Riff Raff's Sister\n* [[Nell Campbell]] (credited as Little Nell) as Columbia, Groupie\n* [[Jonathan Adams (British actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as Dr. Everett V.

One just automatically knows what spacesuits look like, the same way one intuitively knows how Americans dress. I had never been to the United States, but I had this fixed idea of how people looked there. Americans wore polyester so their clothes wouldn't crease, and their trousers were a bit too short. Since they're very keen on sports, white socks and white T-shirts played an integral part in their wardrobe. Of course, since doing ''Rocky'' I have been to the United States and admit it was a bit of a generalization, but my ideas worked perfectly for Brad and Janet.<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\nThe budget for the film was US$1,600,000, far more than the stage production budget, but having to double up on costumes for the film production was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set.

According to [[J. Hoberman]], author of ''Midnight Movies'', it was after five months into the film's midnight run when lines began to be shouted by the audience. Louis Farese Jr., a normally quiet teacher, upon seeing the character Janet place a newspaper over her head to protect herself from rain, yelled, \"Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch.\" Originally, Louis and other ''Rocky Horror'' pioneers, including Amy Lazarus, Theresa Krakauskas, and Bill O'Brian, did this to entertain each other, each week trying to come up with something new to make each other laugh. This quickly caught on with other theatre-goers and thus began this self-proclaimed \"counter point dialogue\", which became standard practice and was repeated nearly verbatim at each screening.<ref name=\"Dika2003\" /> Performance groups became a staple at ''Rocky Horror'' screenings due in part to the prominent New York City fan cast.<ref name=\"HenkinHenkin1979\" /> The New York City cast was originally run by former schoolteacher and stand-up comic [[Sal Piro]] and his friend Dori Hartley, the latter of whom portrayed Dr. Frank N.
