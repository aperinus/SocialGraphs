The film stars [[Peter Weller]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[Dan O'Herlihy|Daniel O'Herlihy]], [[Ronny Cox]], [[Kurtwood Smith]], and [[Miguel Ferrer]]. Set in a crime-ridden [[Detroit]], in the near future, ''RoboCop'' centers on police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) who is murdered by a gang of criminals and subsequently revived by the megacorporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] as the [[cyborg]] law enforcer [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]]. Unaware of his former life, RoboCop executes a brutal campaign against crime while coming to terms with the lingering fragments of his humanity.\n\nThe film was conceived by Neumeier while working on the set of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and he developed the idea further with Miner. Their script was purchased in early 1985 by producer [[Jon Davison (film producer)|Jon Davison]] on behalf of [[Orion Pictures]]. Finding a director proved difficult; Verhoeven dismissed the script twice because he did not understand its satirical content until convinced of it by his wife. Filming took place between August and October 1986, mainly in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. [[Rob Bottin]] led the special-effects team in creating [[practical effect]]s, violent gore, and the RoboCop costume.\n\nVerhoeven emphasized violence throughout the film, making it so outlandish it became comical. Even so, censorship boards believed it was too extreme, and several scenes were shortened or modified to secure an acceptable [[Motion picture content rating system|theatrical rating]]. Despite predicted difficulties in marketing the film, particularly because of its title, the film was expected to perform well based on pre-release critic screenings and positive word of mouth. ''RoboCop'' was a financial success upon its release in July 1987, earning $53.4{{nbsp}}million. Reviews praised the film as a clever action film with deeper philosophical messages and satire but were more conflicted over the extreme violence throughout. The film was nominated for several awards, and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as well as numerous [[Saturn Awards]]. \n\nSince its release, ''RoboCop'' has been critically reevaluated and it has been hailed as one of the best films of the 1980s and one of the greatest science fiction and action films ever made. The film has been lauded for its depiction of a robot affected by the loss of humanity in contrast to the stoic and emotionless robotic characters of that era. The film has continued to be analyzed for themes including the nature of humanity, personal identity, corporate greed, and corruption, and is seen as a rebuke of the policies of [[Ronald Reagan]]. The success of ''RoboCop'' created a [[RoboCop (franchise)|franchise]] comprising the sequels ''[[RoboCop 2]]'' (1990) and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' (1993), children's animated series, multiple live-action television shows, [[List of RoboCop video games|video games]], [[RoboCop (comics)|comic books]], toys, clothing, and other merchandise. A [[RoboCop (2014 film)|remake]] was released in 2014. A direct sequel to the original 1987 film, tentatively titled ''[[RoboCop Returns]]'', is in development as of 2020; it ignores other entries in the series.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn a near-future [[dystopia]], [[Detroit]] is on the brink of societal and financial collapse. Overwhelmed by crime and dwindling resources, the city grants the mega-corporation [[RoboCop (franchise)#Omni Consumer Products|Omni Consumer Products]] (OCP) control over the [[Detroit Police Department]]. OCP Senior President Dick Jones demonstrates [[ED-209]], a law enforcement droid designed to supplant the police. ED-209 malfunctions and brutally kills an executive, allowing ambitious junior executive Bob Morton to introduce the Chairman (\"The Old Man\") to his own project: [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]]. Meanwhile, officer Alex Murphy is transferred to the Metro West precinct. Murphy and his new partner, Anne Lewis, pursue notorious criminal Clarence Boddicker and his gang\u2014Emil Antonowsky, Leon Nash, Joe Cox and Steve Minh. The gang ambushes and tortures Murphy until Boddicker fatally shoots him. Morton has Murphy's corpse converted into RoboCop, a powerful and heavily armored cyborg with no memory of his former life. RoboCop is programmed with three prime directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. A fourth prime directive, Directive 4, is classified.\n\nRoboCop is assigned to Metro West and hailed by the media for his brutally efficient campaign against crime. Lewis suspects he is Murphy, recognizing the unique way he holsters his gun, a trick Murphy learned to impress his son. During maintenance, RoboCop experiences a nightmare of Murphy's death. He leaves the station and encounters Lewis, who addresses him as Murphy. While on patrol, RoboCop arrests Emil, who recognizes Murphy's mannerisms, furthering RoboCop's recall. RoboCop then uses the police database to identify Emil's associates and review Murphy's police record. RoboCop recalls further memories while exploring Murphy's former home, his wife and son having moved away following his death. Elsewhere, Jones gets Boddicker to murder Morton, in revenge for Morton's attempting to usurp his position at OCP. RoboCop tracks down the Boddicker gang and a shootout occurs. He brutally assaults Boddicker, who confesses to working for Jones. RoboCop attempts to kill Boddicker until his programming directs him to uphold the law. He attempts to arrest Jones at OCP Tower, but Directive 4 is activated\u2014a failsafe measure to neutralize RoboCop when acting against an OCP executive. Jones admits his culpability in Morton's death and releases an ED-209 to destroy RoboCop. Although he escapes, RoboCop is assaulted by the police force on OCP's order and is badly damaged. Lewis helps RoboCop escape to an abandoned steel mill to repair himself.\n\nAngered by OCP's underfunding and short-staffing, the police force goes on strike, and Detroit descends into chaos as riots break out throughout the city. Jones frees Boddicker and his remaining gang, arming them with high-powered weaponry to destroy RoboCop. At the steel mill, Boddicker's men are quickly eliminated, but Lewis is badly injured and RoboCop becomes trapped under steel girders. Even so, he kills Boddicker by stabbing him in the throat with his data spike. RoboCop confronts Jones at OCP Tower during a board meeting, revealing the truth behind Morton's murder. Jones, in order to escape, takes the Old Man hostage but is promptly fired from OCP, nullifying Directive 4 and allowing RoboCop to shoot him, causing Jones to crash through a window to his death. The Old Man compliments RoboCop's shooting and asks his name; RoboCop replies, \"Murphy\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Peter Weller]] (pictured in 2016), [[Ronny Cox]] (2019), [[Kurtwood Smith]] (2010), and [[Miguel Ferrer]] (2015)\n| image1 = Peter Weller 2016.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Peter Weller\n| image2 = Ronny Cox 2019.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Ronny Cox\n| image3 = Kurtwood Smith by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt3= A photograph of Kurtwood Smith\n| image4 = Miguel Ferrer 2015.jpg\n| alt4= A photograph of Miguel Ferrer\n}}\n* [[Peter Weller]] as Alex Murphy / RoboCop: A Detroit police officer murdered in the line of duty and revived as a cyborg<ref name=\"DallasHistory\"/>\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Anne Lewis: A tough and loyal police officer<ref name=\"SunSentinelLewis\"/>\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy|Daniel O'Herlihy]] as the Old Man: The chief executive of OCP<ref name=\"BBCOherlihy\"/>\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Dick Jones: The Senior President of OCP<ref name=\"BloodDisgustingCox\"/>\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Clarence Boddicker: A crime lord in league with Dick Jones<ref name=\"DallasHistory\"/>\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Bob Morton: An ambitious OCP junior executive responsible for the \"RoboCop\" project<ref name=\"DallasHistory\"/><ref name=\"DOGWhereareThey\"/>\n\nIn addition to the main cast, ''RoboCop'' features [[Paul McCrane]] as Emil Antonowsky, [[Ray Wise]] as Leon Nash, [[Jesse D.

Inspired by comic books and his personal experience with corporate culture, Neumeier wanted to satirize 1980s business culture, noting the increasing aggression of American financial services in response to growing Japanese influence and that a popular book on [[Wall Street]] was ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', a 17th-century text discussing how to kill more effectively. He also believed that Detroit's declining automobile industry was due to increased bureaucracy.

So when you have this cop who works for a corporation that insists 'I own you,' and he still does the right thing\u2014that's the core of the film.\" The in-film media breaks were Neumeier's and Miner's idea.

''RoboCop'' satirizes Reagan's political policies, espousing limited regulation, [[trickle-down economics]], and a pro-business agenda.]]\n\nA central theme in ''RoboCop'' is the power of corporations. Those depicted in the film are corrupt and greedy, privatizing public services and gentrifying the entirety of Detroit.<ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/><ref name=\"SyFyThemes\"/> A self-described [[hippie]] who grew up during the [[Watergate scandal]] and [[Vietnam War]], Miner was critical of the pro-business policies of President Reagan and believed Detroit to be a city destroyed by American corporations.<ref name=\"EsquireOral\"/><ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/><ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/> The Detroit presented in the film is described by various authors as one beset by rape, crime, and \"Reaganomics gone awry\", where [[gentrification]] is equivalent to crime and unfettered capitalism of Reagan-era politics results in corporations conducting literal war as the police become a profit-driven entity.<ref name=\"WaPoReviewKempley\"/><ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoReaderReview\"/> Miner said that out-of-control crime was a particularly Republican or right-wing fear, but ''RoboCop'' puts the blame for drugs and crime on advancing technology and the privatization of public services, such as hospitals, prisons and the police.<ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/> The criticism of Reagan-era policies was in the script but Verhoeven did not personally understand urban politics such as [[Private prison|privatizing prisons]].<ref name=\"SFX\"/><ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/> Weller said that [[trickle-down economics]] espoused by Reagan were \"bullshit\" and did not work fast enough for those in need.<ref name=\"SFX\"/>\n\nMichael Robertson described the media breaks throughout the film as direct criticisms of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Reagan policies. He focused on OCP's claim that it has private ownership over RoboCop, despite making use of Murphy's corpse. The Old Man was based on Reagan, and the corporation policies emphasize greed and profit over individual rights. The police are deliberately underfunded and the creation of RoboCop is done with the aim of supplanting the police with a more efficient force. Jones openly admits that it does not matter if ED-209 works, because they have contracts to provide spare parts for years. He plots with Boddicker to corrupt the workers brought in to build Delta City with drugs and prostitution.{{sfn|Robertson|2008|pp=219\u2013220}} Davison believed the film is politically [[Liberalism|liberal]] but the violence made it \"[[fascism]] for liberals\".<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/> It also demonstrates a pro-labor union stance: the police chief, believing in the essential nature of their service, refuses to strike but the underfunded, understaffed and under-assault police eventually do so. OCP sees the strike merely as an opportunity to develop more robots.<ref name=\"VulureThemes\"/>\n\n=== Masculinity and authority ===\nVince Mancini describes the 1980s as a period in which cinematic heroes were unambiguously good, as depicted in films that promoted suburban living, materialism, and unambiguous villains, such as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981) and ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/> Some films of the decade send the message that authority is good and to be trusted, but ''RoboCop'' demonstrates that those in authority are flawed, and that Detroit has been carved up by greed, capitalism, and cheap foreign labor.<ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/> Weller described RoboCop as an evolution of strait-laced heroes of the 1940s\u2014such as [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Jimmy Stewart]]\u2014who lived life honorably, with modern audiences now cheering a maimed police officer taking brutal revenge.<ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/>\n\nSusan Jeffords considers ''RoboCop'' to be among the many \"hard body\" films of the decade that portray perfect, strong, masculine physiques who must protect the \"soft bodies\": the ineffectual and the weak. RoboCop portrays strength by eliminating crime and redeeming the city through violence. Bullets ricochet harmlessly off RoboCop's armor; and even attempts to attack his crotch, a typical weak point, only hurt the attacker, demonstrating the uncompromising strength and masculinity needed to eliminate crime.<ref name=\"GuericaMag\"/> [[Darian Leader]] argues that it requires the addition of something unnatural to a biological body to be truly masculine. RoboCop's body incorporates technology, a symbolic addition that makes him more than an average man.{{sfn|Leader|1996|pp=27\u201429}}\n\n=== Humanity and death ===\n[[File:The Resurrection by Carl Heinrich Bloch, 1881.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A painting of the Resurrection of Christ by Heinrich Bloch|''The Resurrection'' by Carl Heinrich Bloch, 1881. Murphy's transformation into RoboCop is a direct analogue of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[resurrection of Jesus]].]]\n\nAnother central theme is the question of what humanity is, and how much of Murphy is left in RoboCop.<ref name=\"WaPoReviewKempley\"/><ref name=\"RogerEbertReview\"/> Neumeier wanted to leave audiences asking \"what's left\" of Murphy, and he described the character's journey as one of coping with his transformation.{{sfn|Bates|1987|p=23}} As an officer, Murphy works for a corporation that insists it owns individuals based on waivers and can do with Murphy's remains as it wishes. Even so, Murphy does the right thing and fights against the demands of his corporate masters.<ref name=\"EsquireOral\"/> Despite his inhuman appearance, RoboCop has a soul, experiences real human fears, and has a core consciousness that makes him more than a machine.<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/> In contrast, Brooks Landon argues that Murphy is dead and, while he recalls memories of Murphy's life, RoboCop is not and can never be Murphy and regain enough of his humanity to rejoin his family.{{sfn|Landon|1987|p=20}} Dale Bradley posits that RoboCop is a machine who mistakenly thinks it is Murphy because of its composite parts and only believes it has a human spirit within.{{sfn|Bradley|2008|p=16}} An alternative view is that RoboCop's personality is a new construct informed partially by fragments of Murphy's own personality.{{sfn|Bradley|2008|p=17}} [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] describes Murphy as a man between life and death, who is by all measure deceased and simultaneously reanimated with mechanical parts. As he regains his humanity, he transforms from a state of being programmed by others to his former state as a being of desire. \u017di\u017eek calls this return of the living dead a fundamental fantasy of the masses, the desire to avoid death and take revenge against the living.{{sfn|\u017di\u017eek|1992|p=22}}\n\nMurphy's death is prolonged and violent so that the audience can see RoboCop as imbued with the humanity taken from him by the inhumane actions of Boddicker's gang and OCP.<ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/> Verhoeven considered it important to acknowledge the inherent darkness of humanity to avoid inevitable mutual destruction. He was affected by his childhood experiences during [[World War II]] and the inhuman actions he witnessed. He believed the concept of the immaculate hero died following the war and subsequent heroes had a dark side that they had to overcome.<ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/> Describing the difference between making films in Europe and America, Verhoeven said that a European ''RoboCop'' would explore the spiritual and psychological problems of RoboCop's condition, where the American version focuses on revenge.<ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/> He also incorporated Christian mythology into the film: Murphy's brutal death is referred to as the crucifixion of Jesus before his resurrection as RoboCop, an American Jesus who [[Jesus walking on water|walks on water]] at the steel mill and wields a handgun.<ref name=\"EsquireOral\"/><ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/> Verhoeven asserted he had no belief in the [[resurrection of Jesus]] but \"[he] can see the value of that idea, the purity of that idea. So from an artistic point of view, it's absolutely true\".<ref name=\"EsquireOral\"/><ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/> The scene of RoboCop returning to Murphy's home is described as like finding the [[Garden of Eden]] or a paradise.<ref name=\"DallasHistory\"/><ref name=\"EsquireOral\"/>\n\nBrooks Landon describes the film as typical of the [[cyberpunk]] genre, because it does not treat RoboCop as better or worse than average humans, simply different and asks the audience to consider him as a new lifeform.<ref name=\"LATimesVerhnMakesGood\"/>{{sfn|Landon|1987|p=20}} The film does not treat this technological advance as necessarily negative, just an inevitable result of a progression that will change one's life and one's understanding of what it means to be human.{{sfn|Landon|1987|p=20}} In this way, the RoboCop character is the embodiment of the struggle of humanity in giving itself over to technology.<ref name=\"TheDissolveNeumeier\"/> The central cast are not given romantic interests or overt sexual desires. Paul Sammon described the scene of RoboCop shooting bottles of baby food as a symbol of the relationship he and Lewis can never have.<ref name=\"UproxxRetro\"/>{{sfn|Sammon|1987|p=39}} Taylor concurred but believed the confrontation between Morton and Jones in the OCP bathroom was sexualized.<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Cultural influence===\n[[File:Edward Neumeier 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A photograph of Edward Neumeier|Writer [[Edward Neumeier]] (pictured in 2007).
