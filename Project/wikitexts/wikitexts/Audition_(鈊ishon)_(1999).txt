Starring [[Ryo Ishibashi]] and [[Eihi Shiina]], the film is about a widower, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ishibashi), who stages a phony audition to meet a potential new romantic partner. After interviewing several women, Aoyama becomes interested in Asami (Shiina), whose dark past affects their relationship.\n\n''Audition'' was originally a project of the Japanese company Omega Project, who wanted to make a horror film after the great financial success of their previous production ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]''. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Murakami's book and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, with the exception of Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to her career in film. The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.\n\n''Audition'' premiered, with a few other Japanese horror films, at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]], but it received much more attention when it was shown at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam|Rotterdam International Film Festival]] in 2000, where it received the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Prize]] and the KNF Award. Following a theatrical release in Japan, the film continued to play at festivals and had theatrical releases in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by several home media releases.\n\n''Audition'' was received positively by Western film critics on its release, with many noting the final torture sequence in the film and how it contrasts with the non-horrific scenes before. The film has appeared on several lists of the best horror films ever made, and has had an influence on other horror films and directors including [[Eli Roth]] and the [[Soska sisters]].\n\n==Plot==\nShigeharu Aoyama is a widower whose son Shigehiko says that he should find a new wife. Shigeharu's friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, a film producer, devises a mock casting audition at which young women audition for the \"part\" of Shigeharu's new wife. Shigeharu agrees to the plan and is immediately enchanted by Asami Yamazaki, attracted to her apparent emotional depth.\n\nYasuhisa cannot reach any of the references in Asami's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, such as a music producer she said she worked for, who is missing. However, Shigeharu is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers, pretending that she never expected Shigeharu to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where Shigeharu intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before having sex, Asami demands that Shigeharu pledge his love to her and no one else. Deeply moved, Shigeharu agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.\n\nShigeharu tries to track her down using her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but as Yasuhisa warned, all of the contacts are dead ends. At the dance studio where she said she was trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she said she worked has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Shigeharu that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Shigeharu has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Shigeharu's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Shigeharu comes home, pours a drink, and after a short while feels the effects of the drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.\n\nShigeharu collapses from the drug. Asami injects him with a [[paralytic agent]] that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that, just like everyone else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into the skin below his eyes, saying \"deeper\" continuously as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with a [[wire saw]]. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Shigeharu's other foot, and she sneaks up on him with a spray. As she attacks the boy, Shigeharu appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Shigeharu proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to reality to find his son fighting Asami, who is brandishing a can of [[Mace (spray)|mace]]. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Shigeharu tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Eihi Shiina]] as {{nihongo|Asami Yamazaki|\u5c71\u5d0e \u9ebb\u7f8e|Yamazaki Asami}}\n*[[Ryo Ishibashi]] as {{nihongo|Shigeharu Aoyama|\u9752\u5c71 \u91cd\u6cbb|Aoyama Shigeharu}}\n*[[Jun Kunimura]] as {{nihongo|Yasuhisa Yoshikawa|\u5409\u5ddd\u6cf0\u4e45|Yoshikawa Yasuhisa}}\n*[[Tetsu Sawaki]] as {{nihongo|Shigehiko Aoyama|\u9752\u5c71 \u91cd\u5f66|Aoyama Shigehiko}}\n*[[Miyuki Matsuda]] as {{nihongo|Ryoko Aoyama|\u9752\u5c71\u826f\u5b50|Aoyama Ryoko}}\n*[[Toshie Negishi]] as {{nihongo|Rie|\u30ea\u30a8}}\n* Shigeru Saiki as {{nihongo|Toastmaster|\u9152\u5834\u306e\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Sakaba no masut\u0101}}\n*[[Ken Mitsuishi]] as {{nihongo|Director|\u30c7\u30a3\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Direkut\u0101}}\n*[[Ren Ohsugi]] as {{nihongo|Shimada|\u829d\u7530}}\n*[[Renji Ishibashi]] as {{nihongo|Old man in wheelchair|\u8eca\u6905\u5b50\u306e\u8001\u4eba|Kurumaisu no r\u014djin}}\n\n==Themes==\nCritics have considered ''Audition'' as both [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Misogyny|misogynistic]].{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=181}} Miike has stated that when he met journalists in the United Kingdom and France, he found they commented on the film's feminist themes when Asami gets revenge on the men in her life.<ref>{{cite AV media\n | people = Miike, Takashi; Tengan, Daisuke\n | title = Commentary by Takashi Miike and Daisuke Tengan\n | medium = Blu ray (Disc 1)\n | time = 1:02:50\n | publisher = Arrow Films\n | id = FCD1208/1209\n}}</ref> The film sets up Aoyama with traits and behaviors which could be considered sexist: a list of criteria for his bride to meet, and the phoney audition format he uses to search for future wife.{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=189}} Tom Mes, author of ''Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike,'' stated that the torture sequence, with the mutilation of Aoyama, can be seen as revenge from Asami.{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=189}} Dennis Lim of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' examined similar themes, noting that the film is \"ultimately about the male fear of women and female sexuality\" and that women are blatantly objectified in the first half of the film, only to have Asami \"redress this imbalance\" in the second half when she becomes an \"avenging angel\".<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|title='Audition': A Nightmare With No Escape|date=October 4, 2009|access-date=April 22, 2016|last=Lim|first=Dennis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/04/entertainment/ca-secondlook4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111150310/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/04/entertainment/ca-secondlook4|archive-date=November 11, 2012}}</ref> Chris Pizzello, writing in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', stated that one plausible approach to interpreting the film is to see the final act as a representation of Aoyama's guilt at his mistreatment of women and his desire to dominate them. Aoyama develops a paranoid fantasy of an attacking object: because he harbours sadistic thoughts towards women, he develops a fear that the object will retaliate.<ref name=\"LeDrew\" /> Contrary to this, Miike has stated that the final torture scenes in the film are not a paranoid nightmare dreamed up by Aoyama.<ref name=\"ac-review18\" /> Tom Mes has argued against the feminist portrayal of the film, noting that Asami is not motivated by an ideological agenda, and that acknowledging that she takes revenge on a man who has lied to her would be ignoring that she has also lied to Aoyama.{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=189}} Asami states \"I want to tell you everything\" during the torture scene, implying she had not been truthful before.{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=189}} Mes also notes that the avenging angel theme contradicts a feminist-themed revenge interpretation, given that one of Asami's victims is female.{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=189}}{{sfn|Mes|2006|p=190}}\n\nIn ''Audition'', the character of Asami is a victim of [[child abuse]]. Colette Balmain, in her book ''Introduction to Japanese Horror Film'', described Asami as \"just one more face of the wronged women in Japanese culture... They are victims of repression and oppression, and only death and loneliness remain for them\".{{sfn|Balmain|2008|p=112}} The film critic Robin Wood wrote that through her child abuse, Asami is taught that love and pain must be inseparable.<ref name=\"Wood24\">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robin|issue=7|year=2004|publisher=Intellect Ltd.|title=\"Revenge is Sweet\": The Bitterness of Audition|journal=[[Film International]]|issn=1651-6826|page=24}}</ref> The audience is led to identify with Asami through this victimization and also what Stephen LeDrew described as a \"patriarchal Japanese society\".<ref name=\"LeDrew\">{{cite journal|title=Jokes and Their Relation to the Uncanny: The Comic, the Horrific, and Pleasure in Audition and Romero's Dead films|date=January 2006|journal=PSYART|publisher=[[University of Florida]]|last=LeDrew|first=Stephen}}</ref> [[Elvis Mitchell]] (''[[The New York Times]]'') stated that the theme of the film was: \"the objectification of women in Japanese society and the mirror-image horror of retribution it could create\".<ref name=\"nytimes-review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0CEEDB1F3CF93BA3575BC0A9679C8B63|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=FILM REVIEW;
