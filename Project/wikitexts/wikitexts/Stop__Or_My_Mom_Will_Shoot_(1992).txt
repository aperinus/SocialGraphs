Or My Mom Will Shoot - The Cinema Snob on YouTube]</ref> The film was released in the United States on February 21, 1992. The film received highly negative reviews upon release but grossed $70.6 million worldwide.\n\nThe film is generally considered a lesser film in Stallone\u2019s catalog. In 2006, in response to a question about the films Stallone wished he had not done, this film was the first one he mentioned.<ref name=\"aintitcool-dec6\" />\n\n==Plot==\nSergeant Joseph Andrew Bomowski ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) is a tough cop. His seemingly frail mother Tutti ([[Estelle Getty]]) comes to stay with him and progressively interferes in his life, driving him crazy.\n\nAfter cleaning his gun with bleach and finding out she ruined it, Tutti buys him an illegal [[MAC-10]] [[machine pistol]], and  witnesses the murder of one of the men who sold her the gun. Tutti is taken to the police station to give a statement, and starts poking around in Joe's cases. She learns the gun she purchased was part of a collection taken from a burned building, and the gun insurance money was received.\n\nOn her way back home, Tutti recognizes a man at the airport. He  flees when she and Joe follow him, and Tutti remembers she saw him on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' for shooting his mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Sergeant Joseph Andrew \"Joe\" Bomowski\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as Tutti Bomowski\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Lieutenant Gwen Harper\n* Al Fann as Sergeant Lou\n* [[Roger Rees]] as J.
