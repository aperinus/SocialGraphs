During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' causal loop side-effect: objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A') in a continuously repeating sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point.\n\nAbe refines this proof-of-concept and builds a stable time-apparatus (\"the box\"), sized to accommodate a human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past\u2014as part of this process, Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, so as not to interact or interfere with the outside world, after which he enters the box then waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours). Once he exits the box, Abe travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the facility, they watch the earlier version of Abe enter the box.\n\nAbe and Aaron repeat Abe's six-hour experiment multiple times over multiple days, making profitable same-day stock trades armed with foreknowledge of the market's performance. The duo's divergent personalities{{snd}}Abe cautious and controlling, Aaron impulsive and meddlesome{{snd}}put subtle strain on their collaboration and friendship. Additionally, the time travel is taxing on Abe and Aaron's bodies; effectively their days become 36 hours long when including the extra time afforded by the box. As the film progresses, the two men begin to notice alarming side effects of time travel which take the form of earbleeds. Later, they notice their handwriting progressively worsening.\n\nThe tension between Abe and Aaron comes to a head after a late-night encounter with Thomas Granger (father to Abe's girlfriend, Rachel), who appears inexplicably unshaven and exists in overlap with his original suburban self. Granger falls into a comatose state after being pursued by Aaron; Aaron theorizes that, at some unknown point in the future, Granger entered the \"box\", with timeline-altering consequences. Abe concludes that time travel is simply too dangerous, and enters a secret second box (the \"failsafe box,\" built before the experiment began and kept continuously running), traveling back four days to prevent the experiment's launch.\n\nCumulative competing interference wreaks havoc upon the [[timeline]]. Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe (so he will never conduct the initial time travel experiment), and meets Original-Aaron at a park bench (so as to dissuade him), but finds that Future-Aaron has gotten there first (armed with pre-recordings of the past conversations, and an unobtrusive earpiece), having brought a disassembled \"third failsafe box\" four days back with his own body.  Future-Abe faints at this revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue.\n\nThe two men briefly and tentatively reconcile. They jointly travel back in time, experiencing and reshaping an event where Abe's girlfriend Rachel was nearly killed by a gun-wielding party crasher. After many repetitions, Aaron, forearmed with knowledge of the party's events, stops the gunman, becoming a local hero. Abe and Aaron ultimately part ways; Aaron considers a new life in foreign countries where he can tamper more broadly for personal gain, while Abe states his intent to remain in town and dissuade/sabotage the original \"box\" experiment. Abe warns Aaron to leave and never return.\n\nMultiple \"box-aware\" versions of Aaron circulate{{snd}}at least one Future-Aaron has shared his knowledge with Original-Aaron, via discussions, voice-recordings, and an unsuccessful physical altercation. Future-Abe watches over Original-Abe, going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware of the future. An Aaron directs French-speaking workers in the construction of a warehouse-sized box.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shane Carruth]] as Aaron\n* [[David Sullivan (actor)|David Sullivan]] as Abe\n* Casey Gooden as Robert\n* Anand Upadhyaya as Phillip\n* Carrie Crawford as Kara\n* Samantha Thomson as Rachel Granger\n* Brandon Blagg as Will\n\nCarruth cast himself as Aaron after having trouble finding actors who could \"break ... the habit of filling each line with so much drama\".<ref name=\"story-prod\" /> Most of the other actors are either friends or family members.<ref name=\"tech support\">{{cite web|author1=Scott Macaulay|title=Shane Carruth's Primer: Tech Support|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/spring2004/features/tech_support.php#.VprNzyorK00|publisher=The Magazine of Independent Film|access-date=16 January 2016|date=2016|archive-date=June 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610092116/https://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/spring2004/features/tech_support.php#.VprNzyorK00|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=itl>{{cite web|title=In the Loop: Shane Carruth's Primer|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2013/10/25/in-the-loop-shane-carruths-primer/|publisher=Electric Sheep Magazine (UK)|access-date=16 January 2016|date=25 October 2013|archive-date=December 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222173246/http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2013/10/25/in-the-loop-shane-carruths-primer/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\nAlthough one of the more fantastical elements of science fiction is central to the film, Carruth's goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down-to-earth and realistic manner.

They have plans for such a device from another development team, but wish to improve on the viability of the design. Their main approach to achieve this is to discard the coolant bath for the required [[superconductors]]. They instead increase the transition temperature of the superconductor to \"something more usable\", a [[room-temperature superconductor]]. The time machine makes use of the property of superconductors called the [[Meissner effect]], which \"knock[s] out the interior magnetic field\".\n* Aaron and Abe require [[palladium]] to build their machine. This is the reason they take the [[catalytic converter]] containing a small amount of palladium from a car.\n* The principles of time travel in the film are inspired by [[Feynman diagram]]s.

He took the unusual step of eschewing contrived exposition, and tried instead to portray the shorthand phrases and jargon used by working scientists. This philosophy carried over into [[Production designer|production design]]. The time machine itself is a plain gray box, with a distinctive electronic \"hum\" created by overlaying the sounds of a mechanical grinder and a car engine, rather than by using a processed [[Digital audio|digital effect]]. Carruth also set the story in unglamorous industrial parks and suburban tract homes.<ref name=\"story-prod\" />\n\nCarruth chose to deliberately obfuscate the film's plot to mirror the complexity and confusion created by time travel. As he said in a 2004 interview: \"This machine and Abe and Aaron's experience are inherently complicated so it needed to be that way in order for the audience to be where Abe and Aaron are, which was always my hope.\"<ref name=\"about-com\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] took place over five weeks, on the outskirts of [[Dallas]], Texas.<ref name=\"story-prod\" /> The film was produced on a budget of only US$7,000,<ref name=\"indiewire\" /> and a skeleton crew of five. Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0390384|title=Primer}}</ref> He also stars in the film as Aaron, and many of the other characters are played by his friends and family. The small budget required conservative use of the [[16 mm film|Super 16mm]] filmstock:<ref name=\"story-prod\" /> the carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low [[shooting ratio]] of 2:1. Every shot in the film was meticulously [[storyboard]]ed on 35&nbsp;mm stills.<ref name=\"about-com\" /> Carruth created a distinctive flat, overexposed look for the film by using fluorescent lighting, non-neutral color temperatures, high-speed film stock, and filters.<ref name=\"story-prod\" />\n\nAfter shooting, Carruth took two years to fully [[Post-production|post-produce]] ''Primer''.

They talk and act (and ''think'') like the kind of people who might accidentally figure out how to move through time, which is why it's the best depiction we have of the ethical quandaries that might result from such a discovery.}}\n\nUltimately, Klosterman says, the lesson of ''Primer'' regarding time travel is that \"it's too important to use only for money, but too dangerous to use for anything else\".<ref name=\"Klosterman essay\">{{cite book|last=Klosterman|first=Chuck|title=Eating the Dinosaur|url=https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4165-4421-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eatingdinosaur00klos/page/63 63\u201366]|author-link=Chuck Klosterman}}</ref>\n\nThe American director [[Steven Soderbergh]] is regarded as a fan of the film.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Kevin Jagernauth |title=Shane Carruth Talks Sci-Fi \u2018A Topiary,\u2019 Shares Plot Details, Reveals Steven Soderbergh & David Fincher Were Going To Produce |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/03/shane-carruth-talks-sci-fi-a-topiary-shares-plot-details-reveals-steven-soderbergh-david-fincher-were-going-to-produce-100559/ |website=IndieWire |publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC. |access-date=12 July 2021 |date=March 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Mary Kaye Schilling |title=Steven Soderbergh on Quitting Hollywood, Getting the Best Out of J.Lo, and His Love of Girls |url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/01/steven-soderbergh-in-conversation.html |website=Vulture |publisher=Vox Media, LLC. |access-date=12 July 2021 |date=August 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe film has been selected to be part of ''[[The A.V.
