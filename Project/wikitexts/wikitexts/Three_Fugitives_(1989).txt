It is a remake of ''[[Les Fugitifs]]'', a 1986 French comedy starring [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] and [[Pierre Richard]] also directed by Veber.\n\nThe movie was popular at the box office, grossing more than $40.6 million<ref name=MoJo/> against a budget of $15 million,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} despite receiving a general negative reception from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nDaniel Lucas has been in prison for armed robbery. On the day he is released, he gets taken hostage by Ned Perry, an incompetent, novice criminal who robs a bank (to get money for treatment for his ill daughter, Meg) at the moment Lucas just happens to be there.\n\nDetective Marvin Dugan assumes they must be in it together and sets about tracking them down. Several chases, an accidental shooting, treatment from a senile vet who thinks Lucas is a dog and other capers follow, all the while Lucas trying to ditch his idiotic companion and prove his own innocence.\n\nWhilst avoiding the law, the two form an unlikely partnership to help cure the silent Meg and make good their escape. They rescue Meg from the care home she is in (with Ned nearly ruining the whole affair with his clumsiness) and flee for Canada, pretending to be a married couple with a son.\n\nNed later enters a Canadian bank to change some currency only to find himself taken hostage by a different bank robber in the same manner he originally kidnapped Lucas. Because of this unexpected development, Lucas does not need to say goodbye to Meg, with whom he has formed a bond.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Daniel James Lucas\n* [[Martin Short]] as Ned Perry\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Inspector Marvin Dugan\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Inspector Tenner\n* Sarah Doroff as Megan 'Meg' Perry\n* [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Dr. Horvath\n* [[David Arnott]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Constable Jane Karie\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Charlie\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as Tucker\n* Rocky Giordani as Bowles\n* Stanley Brock as Release Sergent\n* [[Rick Hall]] as Billy, Dog Handler\n* [[Brian Thompson]] as Second Thug\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Fisherman\n* [[Kathy Kinney]] as Receptionist\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Street Cop\n* [[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]] as Orderly #2\n* [[Dinah Lenney]] as Reporter #1\n* [[John Aylward]] as Second Cop\n* [[Tim De Zarn]] as First Cop\n* [[Rhoda Gemignani]] as Radio Announcer\n* [[Charles Noland]] as Bartender Dave\n* [[Albert Henderson (actor)|Albert Henderson]] as Man In Raincoat\n* [[Gary Armagnac]] as Cop #2\n* [[Dean Smith]] as Barry 'Playboy' Jones\n* [[Mike MacDonald (comedian)|Mike MacDonald]] as Sergeant Snow\n* Michael Siegel as Cop #4\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics.
