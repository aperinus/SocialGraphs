It is a [[sequel]] to Wirkola's 2009 film ''[[Dead Snow]]''. The film was released in Norway on 12 February and in the United States on 10 October 2014. Vegar Hoel reprises his role from the first film as Martin, the sole survivor of an attack by Nazi zombies led by the evil Herzog (\u00d8rjan Gamst). Filming took place in Iceland.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Dead Snow|Previously]], Martin and his friends draw the ire of Nazi zombies after unwittingly taking their gold. When Martin is bitten on the arm, he removes the infected arm with a chainsaw. After returning their gold to the Nazi zombies, Martin realizes he forgot a coin. The zombies chase after him, and their commander, Herzog, tenaciously holds on to Martin's car as he flees. An oncoming truck slices off Herzog's arm, which remains in the car with Martin.\n\nAfter Martin passes out at the wheel and is involved in an accident, he wakes in a hospital. The police disbelieve his wild stories about zombies and charge him with the murder of his friends. To his horror, Martin finds that a surgeon has attached Herzog's arm to his stump (believing it to be Martin's). The zombie arm goes berserk and attacks everyone within reach. After Martin kills several people against his will, he is sedated and strapped tightly to the bed. In the meantime, Herzog has his lost arm replaced and begins to conscript more zombie troops by resurrecting freshly killed locals.\n\nBobby, a young American tourist, sneaks into Martin's room when he hears rumors of a zombie attack. Impressed with Martin's zombie arm, Bobby frees Martin and tells him about the Zombie Squad, American professional zombie hunters. Before Bobby can contact them, the zombie arm throws Bobby out a window. Panicked, Martin follows and administers CPR, but the zombie arm instead crushes Bobby's chest, killing him. Martin flees the police, who believe him a child killer, and makes contact with the Zombie Squad - who turn out to be three nerdy friends: Daniel, Monica, and Blake - who promise to come to Norway and assist. In the meantime, they ask Martin to find out what Herzog wants.\n\nAt a World War II museum, Martin meets Glenn Kenneth, the souvenir shop's clerk. After the zombie arm intimidates him, Glenn takes Martin to the museum, where they read about Herzog's history: Herzog was originally tasked by Hitler himself to wipe out [[Talvik, Norway|Talvik]] for their anti-Nazi sabotage. As Martin realizes Herzog intends to carry out his orders, Herzog and his Nazi zombies attack a group of tourists outside, and following the slaughter, Herzog has his troops arm themselves with old weapons from the museum, including a World War II-era [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank. Martin and Glenn escape death by pretending to be mannequins in the museum. While surveying the carnage, Martin accidentally discovers that his zombie arm can also raise and control the dead. When Daniel arrives, he kills the zombie Martin has resurrected; Martin demonstrates his newfound power by raising it again.\n\nMartin, Daniel, and the sidekick zombie race to find the burial ground of a group of Russian POWs, who had been executed by Herzog during the war, as Monica, Blake, and Glenn work to slow down Herzog. Monica and Blake convince Glenn to act as bait to draw some of the zombies into a local swamp, where they kill them with pipe bombs they made from the supplies they had. After shooting at them with the tank gun several times, Herzog continues on his way, believing Blake, Glenn and Monica to be dead. Meanwhile, the others discover the graveyard, and Martin raises an entire troop of loyal Russian zombies. All converge at the town, where Martin confronts Herzog. Martin points out that they have evacuated the townspeople and thus prevented Herzog from completing his orders, but Herzog does not care and attacks them.\n\nThe battle goes well at first, but the Nazi zombies eventually overpower Martin's Russian zombies after Herzog kills the Russian Commander, Lt Stavarin. As the Nazi zombies close in on them, Daniel tells Martin to kill Herzog, as it is their only chance. Daniel attempts to take control of the Nazi zombie's tank, Martin directly confronts Herzog, and the others fight Herzog's remaining zombies. Glenn is killed by a sneaky knife attack to the throat by a Nazi zombie, and Monica and Blake are about to be overwhelmed when Daniel fires the tank gun directly at Herzog while Martin keeps him distracted. Herzog is decapitated, and the head goes far off into the further away mountains; his troops fall lifelessly to the ground, saving Monica and Blake.\n\nAfter they have celebrated, and having been exonerated from the murder charges after the police also witnessed the zombie battle, Martin drives to the church where Hanna is buried, digs up her corpse, and brings her back as a zombie. The two proceed to make out and have sex as the sidekick zombie looks on in the distance. In a [[post-credits scene]], the Nazi doctor recovers Herzog's severed head, which opens its eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* Vegar Hoel as Martin Hykkerud\n* \u00d8rjan Gamst as Standartenf\u00fchrer (Oberst) Herzog\n* [[Martin Starr]] as Daniel\n* Jocelyn DeBoer as Monica\n* Ingrid Haas as Blake\n* [[Stig Frode Henriksen]] as Glenn Kenneth\n* Hallvard Holmen as Gunga\n* [[Kristoffer Joner]] as Sidekick Zombie\n* [[Amrita Acharia]] as Reidun\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Stavarin\n* [[Bjarte Tj\u00f8stheim]] as Priest\n* Christian Rubeck as Policeman\n* [[Charlotte Frogner]] as Hanna\n* Jesper Sundnes as Nazi Doctor\n* Tage Guddingsmo as Zombie Navigator\n* David Skaufjord as Zombie Tank Driver\n* Daniel Berge Halvorsen as Major Stubbe\n* Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3lafsson as Elderly Woman\n* Ingar Helge Gimle as Doctor Brochman\n* Carl-Magnus Adner as Bobby\n* [[Mar\u00eda Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir (filmmaker)|Mar\u00eda Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir]] as Dame I Rullestol\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Dead Snow 2: Red vs Dead'' was shot in both English and Norwegian at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/09/16/kultur/filter/film/dod_sno_2/tommy_wirkola/35299156/|title=At det er litt norsk aksent gj\u00f8r ingenting|last=Thorkildsen|first=Joakim|work=[[Dagbladet]]|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> Filming took place in Iceland.
