L. Hanna High School]] football coach Harold Jones ([[Ed Harris]]) and a young man with an intellectual disability, [[James \"Radio\" Kennedy|James Robert \"Radio\" Kennedy]] ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]). The film co-stars [[Debra Winger]] and [[Alfre Woodard]]. It was filmed primarily in [[Walterboro, South Carolina]] because its buildings and downtown core still fit the look of the era the film was trying to depict.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1970s, James Robert \"Radio\" Kennedy, a 23-year-old mentally-disabled man, lives alone with his mother who, as a nurse, spends much of the day at work. Radio spends much of his day roaming the town and pushing a shopping cart, which he uses to collect anything interesting he finds. Radio often pauses to observe the local high school football team in their training sessions, led by Coach Harold Jones. During one such session, the football falls out of bounds, allowing Radio to collect it and haul it away in his cart. A group of players retaliate the following day by tying Radio's hands and feet, locking him in the gear shed, and throwing footballs at the door to scare him. Coach Jones frees Radio and punishes the wrongdoers by making them run extra wind sprints after practice. Jones takes it upon himself to assist in Radio's care, and gives him his nickname due to his penchant for listening to the radio. Radio begins assisting Coach Jones on the football team, and inspires the team before each game as a mascot-type figure. Radio's increased attention from Jones is faced with resistance from the football team's parents, who see Radio as a distraction from their own sons' successes.\n\nUpon the end of the football season, Jones involves Radio with several activities within the high school, and winds up neglecting his daughter Mary Helen, who is a member of the high school's cheerleading squad. At a [[Christmas]] mass, Radio receives several gifts from the townspeople, and Mary Helen confides to her father that while she does not blame him for neglecting her, she cannot understand the reason for his interest in Radio. The following day, Radio distributes the gifts around town. He soon encounters a suspicious police officer, and his impaired ability to communicate leads to his arrest on the charge of possessing stolen property. However, the other officers recognize Radio and he is released.  To make up for the wrongful arrest, the arresting officer is forced to ferry Radio around town to finish delivering the gifts. Following the holidays, Radio begins taking classes in the high school to complete his formal education. One of the football players who had previously tormented him tricks Radio into entering the girls' locker room. Radio is reluctant to tell Coach Jones who set him up, but Coach Jones determines the player's identity by interviewing other players and punishes him by benching him for a decisive game. \nRadio's mother suddenly dies of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and Radio finds himself living alone until his absent older brother Walter finally returns to care for him. That same evening, Jones reveals to Mary Helen that his attachment to Radio and need to assist him stems from a childhood incident in which Jones, as a child making a living off delivering newspapers, did not help a mentally-disabled boy his own age crying behind barbed wire. Following the death of Radio's mother, pressure from the school board to have Radio put in a specialized institution strengthens. The association between Radio and Coach Jones is further blamed for the team's inability to win. In a meeting with the townspeople, Jones speaks of Radio being a blessing for the community by showing how people should treat one another, and announces his resignation as head coach so that he may spend more time with his family. At Radio's high school graduation, he receives an honorary diploma and a letterman jacket.  The film ends with clips being shown of the real-life Radio and Coach Jones leading the football team.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as [[James \"Radio\" Kennedy|James Robert \"Radio\" Kennedy]]\n*[[Ed Harris]] as Coach Harold Jones, the head football coach\n*[[Debra Winger]] as Mrs. Linda Jones\n*[[S.
