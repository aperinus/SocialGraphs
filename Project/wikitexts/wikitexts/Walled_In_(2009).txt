The film is based on the best-selling French novel '''''Les Emmur\u00e9s''''' by [[Serge Brussolo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empiremovies.com/index.php?id=20825| title=Mischa Barton Gets Walled In| publisher=Empire Movies|date =2007-11-09}}</ref>  It is Paquet-Brenner's English-language film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nA little girl wakes up to find herself in a small concealed room, confused at what is happening.  When the room starts filling with cement from all corners, the girl cries for her father but the cement only continues to rise, and eventually she is buried alive.\n\nSam Walczak ([[Mischa Barton]]), is a recent engineering graduate. At her graduation party, her father, an owner of a demolition company, gives her a gift: a job supervising the demolition of a building in the middle of nowhere. If she's successful, she will become his partner. Sam arrives at the Malestrazza Building, and is greeted by Mary ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), the caretaker.  Sam tells Mary she will be staying in one of the apartments in the building. Jimmy ([[Cameron Bright]]), the caretaker's teenage son, takes her bags to her apartment, previously owned by someone named Julie, and explains the rules of the building.  She is to stay off the eighth floor because it is Malestrazza's and the roof because it is too dangerous.\n\nSam researches the building and discovers that it was the scene of a horrible series of murders where sixteen people were entombed in the walls.  Jimmy takes Sam to the eighth floor and tells her how his father was one of the victims, the crime being blamed on a local factory worker. The lights go out, and Sam cuts her leg after panicking in the darkness.  Later, Jimmy washes her wound and begins to caress her thigh, but she tells him to stop.  Sam begins having nightmares about being entombed in the walls.\n\nSam's boyfriend arrives, causing Jimmy to grow jealous.  While exploring the eighth floor, Sam and her boyfriend discover a secret passage which would allow someone to secretly view any of the apartments.  Sam realizes that Jimmy has been spying on her.  Later, as Sam and her boyfriend make love, Jimmy watches from behind the walls.  The next morning they find his dog, butchered.  Sam and her boyfriend agree to leave.\n\nJimmy gives Sam a copy of the journal of Joseph Malestrazza, the building's architect.  Sam realizes from reading the journal that there must be a large, open space in the center of the building.  Jimmy goes to the roof to look for an opening to the hidden space.  When he does not return, Sam and her boyfriend follow.  They discover a massive shaft in the center of the building.  They hear Jimmy calling from down in the shaft, saying that he is hurt.  Sam has her boyfriend lower her into the shaft on a rope, but he is shot and killed, causing Sam to fall to the bottom. Jimmy then mails Sam's demolition report and sinks her car into a lake.\n\nSam awakens at the bottom of the shaft and discovers that a man is there with her.  He is Malestrazza, the architect, who has been trapped there by Mary. He tells her that Jimmy is keeping her down there until she learns to love him. While trapped, Sam learns that Malestrazza orchestrated the murders as a form of [[human sacrifice]], citing the fact that, of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], only the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is still standing after thousands of years, because (he believes) it was the only one in which workers were killed and buried during its construction.\n\nAmong his victims were Mary\u2019s daughter Julie (the girl seen in the opening scene) & her father, Mary\u2019s husband, which caused a vengeful Mary to imprison Malestrazza. He also tells Sam that Jimmy is nice, but can be very cruel and imaginative when he disobeys Jimmy's orders.\n\nJimmy sends down a cassette tape, with a message that he wants to see Sam and Malestrazza dance. Sam reluctantly dances, but, when Jimmy tells them to kiss, she refuses. Malestrazza pulls her close and forces her to kiss him. After a few seconds, Jimmy tells them to stop and threatens Malestrazza not to touch Sam again. He sends down a basket with food, water, and a two-way radio. He tells Sam to keep the radio with her so that they can talk and be close.\n\nSam looks for a way to escape and realizes one wall leads to the garbage area. When Jimmy returns, she lies and says that she is hurt and needs medicine. When Jimmy brings her the medicine, she opens the capsules and starts creating a mix to try and blow out the wall to get into the garbage room. Sam's attempt fails, and Jimmy is upset that she tried to escape.\n\nBefore Jimmy could exact his punishment, his mother catches him. Mary realizes that Sam is in the hole with Malestrazza. At first she is infuriated with Jimmy as the hole was constructed for Malestrazza and no one else, but realizes Sam now knows too much and must keep her trapped there as well in order to avoid arrest.\n\nSam is still stuck in the hole with Malestrazza, who she realizes does not want to escape. This is his tomb, and he picked her to kill him. She eventually does kill him after some taunting, and he thanks her after he falls into his tomb and it begins to fill with cement. Sam is by the wall hoping that Jimmy will come through and save her.\n\nThe demolition team arrives and her father asks where Sam is. Mary tells him that she left. Her father says that he thought she would want to see her first building being demolished. Mary is keeping Jimmy calm as they set up and begin to install the explosives. As the countdown begins, Jimmy comes to his senses and runs toward the building for Sam. Sam's father tells them to stop the countdown. At the roof, Jimmy looks down, and her father asks what they have done. Jimmy then throws himself over, killing himself, and lands next to Sam. Sam is then lifted out of the hole and put in an ambulance.\n\nSam narrates that Malestrazza built 27 buildings and that they are all still standing. He considered the Malestrazza building his masterpiece, and there are no plans to demolish it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Mischa Barton]] as Samantha Walczak\n*[[Cameron Bright]] as Jimmy\n*[[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Mary\n*[[Noam Jenkins]] as Peter\n*[[Pascal Greggory]] as Malestrazza\n*[[Eugene Clark (actor)|Eugene Clark]] as Burnett\n*Jane Redlyon as Denise\n*Rob van Meenen as Patrick Walczak\n*Josh Strait as Vincent Walczak\n*Sofi Knight as Julie\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] on 20 February 2009.<ref>[http://www.glasgowfilmfestival.org.uk/programme/show/379 Walled In]{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Glasgow Film Festival</ref>\n\nThe film received a [[straight-to-DVD]] release in [[North America]] on 17 March 2009.<ref>[http://www.upcominghorrormovies.com/movies/walledin.php Walled In] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217232042/http://www.upcominghorrormovies.com/movies/walledin.php |date=2008-12-17 }} UHM</ref>\n\nThere is also an accompanying graphic novel by the same name produced by Spacedog, published through Ape Entertainment, and available in April, 2009.\n\nIt was released by Momentum Pictures on DVD on 5 October 2009 in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=ff>[http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/dvd/Walled+In-6078.html Walled In DVD] FemaleFirst. 8 September 2009</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nBecause the film has been released straight-to-DVD, it has received limited critical reviews.
