It is based on the [[Wonder (Palacio novel)|2012 novel of the same name]] by [[R. J. Palacio]] and stars [[Julia Roberts]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Jacob Tremblay]], [[Noah Jupe]], [[Izabela Vidovic]], [[Bryce Gheisar]], and [[Daveed Diggs]].\n\nThe film, which follows a boy named August Pullman with [[Treacher Collins syndrome]] trying to fit in, was released in the United States on November 17, 2017, by [[Lionsgate]]. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, with many praising Tremblay and Roberts' performances, Chbosky's direction, writing, musical score and faithfulness to Palacio's novel; the film grossed $306 million worldwide on a $20 million budget. At the [[90th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]]. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[sequel]]/[[prequel]] film, ''[[White Bird: A Wonder Story]]'', will release in sometime in the 2020s, with Gheisar reprising his role.\n\n==Plot==\nAugust \"Auggie\" Pullman is a 10-year-old boy living in a [[Brownstone#Use in urban private residences|brownstone]] in [[Brooklyn]] with his mother Isabel, father Nate, older sister Olivia (\"Via\"), and dog Daisy. He was born with the rare medical facial deformity \"[[Franceschetti\u2013Klein syndrome|mandibulofacial dysostosis]]\", and has undergone 27 different surgeries in order to help him see, smell, speak, and hear. \n\nAuggie has been [[Homeschooling|home-schooled]], but as he approaches fifth grade, his parents decide to enroll him in Beecher Prep [[private school|private]] [[middle school]]. When school starts, Auggie is ostracized, but soon forms a close friendship with his classmate, Jack Will.\n\nFor [[Halloween]], Auggie dresses in a [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] mask and cloak from last year when Daisy accidentally ruins the [[Boba Fett]] costume he was planning to wear. Auggie walks through school upbeat and confident due to the anonymity his costume affords him. However, as he enters his homeroom, he overhears Jack, who fails to recognize him, joining Julian Albens and his friends, who ostracizes Auggie, in making fun of him behind his back, saying \"he would [[suicide|kill himself]] if he looked like Auggie.\" Becoming distraught and ill, Isabel abandons her mother-daughter day with Via to bring Auggie home. Though she is hurt, Via convinces him to go [[trick-or-treating]] with her, as she has been rejected by her best friend Miranda.\n\nAuggie forms a new friendship with a girl named Summer, confiding in her about his split with Jack. When Jack asks Summer why Auggie is avoiding him, she only gives Jack the clue \"Ghostface\". In science class, realization dawns on Jack, and he resolves to partner with Auggie instead of Julian for the [[science fair]]. When Julian confronts Jack in the hallway and calls Auggie a \"freak\", they begin fighting, which is broken up by Mr. Browne and another teacher. After suspending Jack for two days, Mr. Tushman reads Jack's letter about defending Auggie. Jack apologizes to him via [[Minecraft]] and they reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Via, even though she loves her family, has been feeling neglected that her parents tend to spend more time looking after Auggie since Auggie was born. She signs up for Drama Club after meeting a theater student named Justin, with whom she soon begins a romantic relationship. She is selected as Miranda's [[understudy]] for the lead role in the school's production of ''[[Our Town]]'', but on opening night, when Justin tells Miranda that Via's family is in attendance after she tells him that her family is not, Miranda feigns illness to let Via take her place. Via gives a moving performance that earns her a standing ovation. She and Miranda reconcile. \n\nAuggie's popularity and circle of friends grow bigger over time, but he continues to be harassed by Julian and his friends until Mr. Browne notices. Mr. Tushman later confronts Julian and his parents with the evidence, including hate notes and a class picture with Auggie [[photoshop]]ped out. Julian's mother admits that she edited Auggie out of the picture and defends her son\u2019s actions, asserting that the students should not be exposed to Auggie. Despite her threats to pull their funding from the school, Mr. Tushman suspends Julian for two days, causing him to miss an upcoming nature retreat. As they leave, Julian becomes distraught when his parents pull him out of the school, declaring he will not be back in the fall. Julian apologizes to Mr. Tushman, who accepts.\n\nAt the nature retreat, Auggie and Jack are ambushed by a trio of seventh graders from another school, but Julian's friends rally and defend them. Auggie becomes more accepted by his classmates afterwards. At the year-end [[graduation]] ceremony, Auggie thanks Isabel for taking him to school. She tells him \"you really are a wonder, Auggie.\" He is given the [[Henry Ward Beecher]] Medal for his strength and courage, and receives a standing ovation from the crowd. As the movie ends with the crowd cheering for Auggie, he finishes the story delivering a voiceover narration telling the viewers, and quoting the last precept Mr. Browne gave in class, \"Be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. And if you really want to see what people are, all you have to do is look.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jacob Tremblay]] as August \"Auggie\" Pullman, a boy with a rare facial deformity.\n* [[Noah Jupe]] as Jack Will, Auggie's best friend\n*[[Julia Roberts]] as Isabel Pullman, Auggie's mother\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Nate Pullman, Auggie's father\n* [[Izabela Vidovic]] as Olivia \"Via\" Pullman, Auggie's older sister\n** Maccie Margaret Chbosky as young Via\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Mr. Lawrence Tushman\n* [[Daveed Diggs]] as Mr. Thomas Browne\n* [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] as Grans\n* [[Danielle Rose Russell]] as Miranda Navas, Via's best friend\n* [[Nadji Jeter]] as Justin Hollander, Via's boyfriend\n* [[Bryce Gheisar]] as Julian Albans, Auggie's classmate and adversary. \n* [[Millie Davis]] as Summer Dawson\n* Elle McKinnon as Charlotte Cody\n* [[Nicole Oliver]] as Amanda Will\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Melissa Albans, Julian's mother\n* [[Steve Bacic]] as Richard Albans, Julian's father\n* [[Ali Liebert]] as Ms. Petosa\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn November 27, 2012, it was announced that [[Lionsgate]] was developing a feature film adaptation of R.
