It is a remake of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film of the same name]] and stars [[Kenny Wormald]], [[Julianne Hough]], [[Miles Teller]], [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Dennis Quaid]]. The film follows a young man who moves from Boston to a small Southern town and protests the town's ban against dancing. Filming took place from September to November 2010 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It was released in Australia and New Zealand on October 6, 2011, and in North America on October 14, 2011. It grossed $15.5&nbsp;million in its opening weekend and $63&nbsp;million worldwide from a $24 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a long night of partying, an intoxicated Bobby Moore and his friends are killed when their car collides head-on with a truck on a bridge on their way home to the town of Bomont, Georgia. This prompts his father Shaw Moore, the town reverend, to persuade the city council to pass several draconian laws and ordinances, one of which bans all unsupervised dancing within city limits.\n\nThree years later, Boston-raised teenager Ren McCormack moves to Bomont to live with his uncle Wes Warnicker, aunt Lulu, and cousins Sarah and Amy after his mother's death from [[leukemia]] and his father's desertion. Upon arrival, Ren befriends fellow Bomont High senior Willard Hewitt, who explains the ban on dancing.\n\nHe soon begins to be attracted to Shaw's rebellious daughter Ariel, who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After Chuck insults him, Ren ends up in a race involving buses and wins despite his inability to drive one and almost getting killed. Shaw mistrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. He also teaches Willard how to dance.\n\nAfter a while, Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, resulting in a fight between them. Later in church, Shaw finds out about it and demands Ren's arrest, but Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren like he did with Bobby. She then reveals that she lost her virginity, prompting Shaw to beg for her to not talk like that in church. Ariel then sarcastically asks him if he will pass another law, as it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. Shaw slaps her abruptly, shocking his wife Vi, and prompting Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize his domineering ways and storm out. \n\nWhen Shaw tries to apologize Vi stops him, telling him he has gone too far. Supporting the dancing movement, she tells him that he is not being good to Ariel, he cannot be everyone's father and dancing and music are not the problems.\n\nRen goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses given to him by Ariel. They describe that even in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate or worship.\n\nDespite the city council voting against him, Ren's boss offers his cotton mill, which is technically in the neighboring town of Bayson, to let the seniors have their prom. Knowing that Shaw still has enough influence to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come, Ren visits him one evening. In the conversation they realize their common ground is the loss of a loved one. After Shaw tells the story of Bobby, Ren describes his mother's death and states that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the dance. He then respectfully requests to take Ariel, and Shaw agrees.\n\nA few days before the prom, Shaw unexpectedly asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. The students (and many parents) prepare and decorate the mill for the prom.\n\nNot long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends arrive to instigate chaos. However, Ren, Willard, Ariel and her best friend Rusty Rodriguez subdue them. Ren goes inside, exclaiming \"Hey, I thought this was a party!\" Then he flings confetti into a shredding machine and yells, \"Let's dance!\" as everyone joins in dancing to the opening song \"Footloose\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kenny Wormald]] as Ren McCormack\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Ariel Moore\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Willard Hewitt\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Vi Moore\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Reverend Shaw Moore\n* [[Ser'Darius Blain]] as Woody\n* Ziah Colon as Rusty Rodriguez\n* [[Patrick Flueger|Patrick John Flueger]] as Chuck Cranston\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Uncle Wes Warnicker\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Aunt Lulu Warnicker\n* Mary-Charles Jones as Cousin Sarah Warnicker\n* [[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]] as Cousin Amy Warnicker\n* [[Josh Warren]] as Richard \"Rich\" Sawyer\n* [[Jayson Warner Smith]] (uncredited) a Officer Herb\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn October 2008, [[Kenny Ortega]] was announced as director but left the project a year later after differences with Paramount and the [[production budget]].<ref name=\"Playbill\">{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Gans |date=October 28, 2008 |title=Zadan and Meron Will Co-Produce 'Footloose' Remake for 'High School Musical' Star Efron |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/122785-Zadan_and_Meron_Will_Co-Produce_Footloose_Remake_for_High_School_Musical_Star_Efron |work=[[Playbill]] |access-date=May 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025034626/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/122785-Zadan-and-Meron-Will-Co-Produce-Footloose-Remake-for-High-School-Musical-Star-Efron |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118010397.html |title=Ortega exits Paramount's 'Footloose' |last=Fleming |first=Michael |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 25, 2009 |access-date=July 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921203749/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118010397.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |archive-date=September 21, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Peter Sollett was also hired to write the script.
