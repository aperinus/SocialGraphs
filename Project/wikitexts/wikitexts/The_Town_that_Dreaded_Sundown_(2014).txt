However, it was conceived as a sequel, with several elements and references from the original. Filming in [[Texarkana]] began Monday, June 17, 2013 and ended in the early morning of June 20, 2013.\n\n''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'' was theatrically released on October 16, 2014, by\u00a0[[Orion Pictures]]. The film had grossed only $120,459 in its initial release and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised its production values, visuals and performances, but criticized its screenplay, unoriginality, and character development. As of February 2019, the film has grossed over $100k through video sales.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n== Plot ==\nOn October 31, 2013, in the city of [[Texarkana]], the local drive-in theater is hosting the Halloween annual showing of the 1976 film ''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'', based on the true story of the [[Texarkana Moonlight Murders|Phantom Killer]] who murdered several people in Texarkana in 1946. Corey Holland and Jami Lerner leave to talk and kiss but The Phantom kills Corey, and tells Jami, \"This is for Mary. Make them remember.\"\n\nTwo days before [[Thanksgiving]], Kendra Collins-Thompson and her boyfriend, Daniel Torrens, are killed by the Phantom while having sex at a motel. The Phantom calls Jami with Corey's phone, telling her, \"I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember.\" She decides to tell her police escort, Deputy Foster. She is helped with her research into the killings by former classmate Nick Strain. [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Lone Wolf Morales takes over the investigation. Jami receives an email from the Phantom and takes it to the police. Nick asks Jami to a vigil for the Phantom victims. There, a suicidal teenager shows up dressed as the Phantom and is killed, causing the townspeople to believe the murderer is actually dead. However, band members Johnny and Roy go to a junkyard to experiment sexually, where they are attacked by the real Phantom. The Phantom recreates the trombone weapon from the original film. Johnny is shot to death and Roy is stabbed.\n\nMorales and Deputy Tillman visit Reverend Cartwright. They discovered that he sent Jami the email, but do not believe he is the Phantom. Jami learns that [[Charles B. Pierce]]'s son is still alive and lives in [[Texarkana]]. On [[Christmas Eve]], Tillman and a his date are killed by the Phantom. Jami and Nick visit Charles Pierce Jr. and learn about Hank McCreedy, a sixth victim of the original Phantom whose story was forgotten. Pierce believes the new Phantom is McCreedy's grandson, because the family was angered that McCreedy's death was not remembered. McCreedy had a wife named Mary.\n\nLillian, Jami's grandmother, finds out that Jami was accepted into a college in [[California]] and decides to move there so Jami can go to school. Jami tells Nick she is leaving and they have sex. Nick is later killed by the Phantom. While leaving town, Jami pulls into a gas station. There, the Phantom starts firing from a window, killing Lillian and several others. Jami runs into the old Union train station and finds Nick's body. She is shot down by arrows and confronted by two Phantom Killers. One is Deputy Foster and the other is Corey, who faked his death. Foster is McCreedy's grandson. Corey tries to convince Jami they are the same: that Texarkana trapped them in roles they hated. He brags about how everyone will know what he did, and decides to kill her, but is killed by Foster who plans to kill Jami and blame the killings on her and Corey. Jami finds the gun and shoots Foster but his body is never found. Jami leaves Texarkana and moves on with her life. In the end, the Phantom's shadow is seen stalking Jami.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Addison Timlin]] as Jami Lerner\n* [[Travis Tope]] as Nick Strain\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Lillian\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Chief Deputy Tillman\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Deputy Foster\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Reverend Cartwright\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as \"Lone Wolf\" Morales\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Sheriff Underwood\n* [[Arabella Field]] as Dr. Kelly\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as Charles Pierce Jr.\n* [[Spencer Treat Clark]] as Corey Holland\n* Morganna Bridgers as Kendra Collins\n* [[Wes Chatham]] as Danny Torrens\n* Jaren Mitchell as Johnny\n* Kurt Krause as Roy\n* [[Lance E.

I didn't find it. He brought it to me. I think he is an amazing, creative force, especially with horror. I think he thinks about horror in a really unique way. So, he pitched it to me and I really wanted to work with him. I didn't know the [original] movie. That's what got me interested in it. I have had a really good working relationship with him. And the whole point of why my business exists and why I'm such a fanatic about making movies inexpensively is that you get to do different stuff. We just wanted to try it. That's the fun thing. When you don't have a $20 million horror film, which is a typical horror movie studio budget, or a $180 million tent-pole budget, looming down at you, you can try new stuff. It may work or it may not work, but the fun is that we can try. It's a really weird movie to remake, and I really like doing weird things.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jason-blum-the-purge-interview |title=Jason Blum Talks THE PURGE and The Town That Dreaded Sundown Remake |date=June 6, 2013 |publisher=Collider |access-date=2013-11-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"The museum is where their base of operations is, and then we're supplying the cars that are coming into the scenes where they shoot the movie.
