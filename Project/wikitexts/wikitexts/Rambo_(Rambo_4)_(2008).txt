The film is dedicated to the memory of [[Richard Crenna]], who died in 2003. Crenna had played [[Sam Trautman|Colonel Sam Trautman]] in the previous films. In the film, Rambo (reprised by Stallone) leads a group of mercenaries into [[Myanmar|Burma]] to rescue Christian missionaries, who have been kidnapped by a local infantry unit.\n\nThe rights to the ''Rambo'' franchise were sold to [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] in 1997 after [[Carolco Pictures]] went bankrupt. Miramax intended to produce a fourth film but Stallone was unmotivated to reprise the role. The rights were then sold to [[Nu Image]] and [[Alchemy (company)|Millennium Films]] in 2005, who green-lit the film before the release of ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Filming began in [[Thailand]], [[Mexico]], and the United States in January 2007, and ended in May 2007.\n\n''Rambo'' was theatrically released on January 25, 2008, to mixed reviews, with praise and criticism aimed at the film's violence, direction, plot, characters, and political commentary.<ref name=\"Huff\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rambo-reviews-definitely-_n_83206|title=Rambo Reviews: Definitely Violent And Otherwise Mixed|first=Katherine|last=Thomson|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=March 28, 2008|access-date=July 5, 2020|url-status=live|archive-date=July 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705134301/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rambo-reviews-definitely-_n_83206}}</ref> It grossed $113.2 million worldwide against a production budget between $47.5\u201350 million. The film was followed by ''[[Rambo: Last Blood]]'', released on September 20, 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nAmid the political protests of the [[Saffron Revolution]] in [[Myanmar|Burma]], ruthless [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]] officer Major Pa Tee Tint leads Burmese regime army forces in pillaging small villages in a campaign of fear. His soldiers sadistically slaughter innocents, abduct teenage boys to be drafted into his army and hold women hostage to be raped as sex slaves. Meanwhile, 20 years after [[Rambo III|the events in Afghanistan]], [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] is still living in [[Thailand]], making a living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides. Michael Burnett, a missionary doctor, attempts to hire Rambo to ferry his group up the [[Salween River]] into Burma on a [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian mission]] to provide medical aid to a village inhabited by the [[Karen people]]. Rambo initially refuses, then agrees when convinced by Michael's fianc\u00e9e Sarah Miller.\n\nDuring the trip, the boat is stopped by pirates demanding Sarah in exchange for passage, forcing Rambo to kill them. The missionaries arrive at the village but are attacked by Tint's forces. Sarah, Michael, and other survivors are taken prisoners. The pastor of the missionaries' church comes to Thailand and asks Rambo to guide a team of five mercenaries on a rescue mission. Rambo takes the mercenary to the drop-off point and offers to help, but Lewis, a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier and the team's leader, refuses.\n\nMyint, a [[Karen National Liberation Army|Karen rebel]] familiar with the area, leads the mercenaries to the site of the massacre. As they survey the damage, a squad of Tint's soldiers arrive in a truck with a group of prisoners, whom they proceed to torment. Rambo arrives in time and kills the soldiers with his bow and arrow, freeing the hostages. Rambo joins the mercenaries and they make their way to Tint's camp at night, where they stealthily rescue the surviving hostages.\n\nThe next morning, Tint and his soldiers pursue them. Rambo lures a section of the army towards a dormant [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] bomb, setting it off with a timed claymore. Tint's forces capture everyone except Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy, the mercenaries' sniper. Before Tint can execute them, Rambo launches a surprise attack with a jeep mounted [[M2 Browning|machine gun]] and starts slaughtering Tint's men, allowing the mercenaries to escape and engage them. The Karen rebels, led by Myint, arrive and join the fight, helping to overwhelm Tint's soldiers and their arriving naval forces. Defeated, Tint attempts to escape, but Rambo intercepts and disembowels him dead with his [[machete]].\n\nIn the aftermath, Rambo, inspired by Sarah's words, returns to the [[United States]] to visit his father at his home in [[Bowie, Arizona]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo]]\n* [[Julie Benz]] as Sarah Miller\n* [[Paul Schulze]] as Michael Burnett\t\n* [[Matthew Marsden]] as School Boy\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Lewis\n* [[Tim Kang]] as En-Joo \n* Rey Gallegos as Diaz \n* [[Jake La Botz]] as Reese\n* Maung Maung Khin as Major Pa Tee Tint\n* [[Ken Howard]] as Father Arthur Marsh\n* [[Supakorn Kitsuwon]] as Myint \n* Aung Aay Noi as Lieutenant Aye \n* Sornram Patchimtasanakarn as Tha \t\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe film was an independent production between [[Nu Image]] and [[Emmett/Furla Films]] for Equity Pictures Medienfonds GmbH.{{sfn|Stephenson|Albertson|2008|loc=01:26}} It was green-lit and sold before ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' was released.{{sfn|Stephenson|Albertson|2008|loc=04:12}} In between the making of the third and fourth films in the ''Rambo'' franchise, the films' original producer, [[Carolco Pictures]], went out of business.

He said \"we were all sitting around in looking at the small production budget. Then I said  'Hey, fake blood is cheap, lets make it all-out bloody.'\" Filming started on January 22, 2007, and ended on May 4, 2007. It was shot in [[Chiang Mai, Thailand]] as well as in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] in [[Arizona]] and [[California]]. While filming near [[Burma]], Stallone and the rest of the crew narrowly avoided being shot by the Burmese military. Stallone described Burma as a \"hellhole\". He said, \"We had shots fired above our heads\" and that he \"witnessed survivors with legs cut off and all kinds of land-mine injuries, maggot-infested wounds and ears cut off.\"<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10467584\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10467584 |title=Sylvester Stallone describes Myanmar 'hellhole' |date=October 3, 2007 |agency=BANG Showbiz |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\n''John Rambo'' was the original working title for the film but was changed in the US because Stallone thought that audiences might think that this is the final film in the ''Rambo'' series (due to the then recently released ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''), which was not his original intent. In many other countries, the title ''John Rambo'' is used because the first ''Rambo'' film was known as ''Rambo'' in those countries. The film premiered on US television as ''Rambo'', but the title sequence referred to it as ''John Rambo''.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that the film title was being changed to ''Rambo: To Hell and Back''. After some negative feedback from the online community, Stallone spoke with [[Harry Knowles]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/34423|title=Whoa Whoa Whoa Who says it ain't gonna be called JOHN RAMBO?|last=headgeek|website=Ain't It Cool}}</ref> and said: <blockquote>Lionsgate jumped the gun on this. I just was thinking that the title ''John Rambo'' was derivative of ''Rocky Balboa'' and might give people the idea that this is the last ''Rambo'' film, and I don't necessarily feel that it will be. He's definitely a superb athlete, there's no reason he can't continue onto another adventure.

The level of violence might not be for everyone, but it has a serious intent. This is the first time that the tone of my novel ''First Blood'' has been used in any of the movies. It's spot-on in terms of how I imagined the character \u2014 angry, burned-out, and filled with self-disgust because Rambo hates what he is and yet knows it's the only thing he does well. ...  I think some elements could have been done better, [but] I think this film deserves a solid three stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmorrell.net/faq.cfm |title=FAQ page at DavidMorell.net |website=davidmorrell.net|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133752/http://www.davidmorrell.net/faq.cfm|archive-date=2008-05-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/movies/story/rambosdadtalks/11597472/18284540 |title=Rambo's Dad Talks |access-date=2008-01-31 |website=[[film.com]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with Hollywood Reporter, Sylvester Stallone singled out the movie as one of his best films:<blockquote>One film I\u2019m truly proud of \u2014 it\u2019s the best action film I\u2019ve ever done because it\u2019s the most truthful \u2014 is Rambo IV, dealing with Burma, where they\u2019ve had a civil war for 67 years. But I got excoriated because the movie\u2019s so violent. And it is violent. It\u2019s horrifying. It\u2019s children being burnt alive. That\u2019s what makes civil war worse than anything: It\u2019s your neighbor, all of a sudden, killing you. I was really happy with that film, and I never thought it would ever reach the theater.
