She is also known for her [[Baton (twirling)|baton twirling]].\n* [[Trip Payne]]: professional puzzlemaker living in [[South Florida]] and three-time ACPT champion.

The episode was written by [[Tim Long]], and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]], and guest-starred crossword puzzle creators Reagle and Shortz as themselves.\n\n''Wordplay'' features a theme song, \"Every Word\", written and performed by [[Gary Louris]] of [[Jayhawks (band)|The Jayhawks]].
