R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[sequel]] to 2013's ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'',  it is the final instalment in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' trilogy]], acting as a [[prequel]] to Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]]. \n\nThe film's story concludes the adventure of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company of dwarves, who take possession of the treasure beneath the Lonely Mountain as various factions clash over it, while Azog the Defiler and his forces make their move.\n\nThe film stars [[Martin Freeman]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]], [[Evangeline Lilly]], [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Ken Stott]], [[Aidan Turner]], [[Dean O'Gorman]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Graham McTavish]], [[James Nesbitt]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[Ryan Gage]]. The [[ensemble cast]] also features [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Hugo Weaving]], and [[Orlando Bloom]]. It was Holm's final film before his death in 2020, as well as Lee's final live-action role, although he would be featured as a voice actor in several films released after his death in 2015.\n\n''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'' premiered in London on 1 December 2014, and was then released on 11 December in New Zealand and on 17 December in the United States, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $962.2 million worldwide, making it the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of 2014]]. The film [[List of accolades received by The Hobbit film series#The Battle of the Five Armies|received numerous accolades]]; at the [[87th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail.

See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. -->\n[[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the Dwarves watch from the [[Lonely Mountain]] as the dragon [[Smaug]] sets [[Esgaroth|Laketown]] ablaze. [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]] breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the [[Middle-earth weapons and armour#Black Arrow|black arrow]]. Smaug's falling body crushes the Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat with the town's gold. Bard becomes the new leader of Laketown and guides its people to seek refuge in the ruins of Dale. Thorin, having become possessive of the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the Arkenstone, which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Upon hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, he orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Saruman]] arrive at [[Dol Guldur]] and free [[Gandalf]], sending him to safety with [[Radagast]]. They battle and defeat the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and then face a formless [[Sauron]] himself. Galadriel defeats him in a duel of wills and banishes him and his forces to the East. [[Azog]], marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son Bolg to [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#Mount Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] to summon their second army. [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]] witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.\n\n[[Thranduil]] and an Elf army arrive in Dale to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by the Dwarf king [[Middle-earth dwarf characters#Thr\u00f3r|Thr\u00f3r]]. Bard asks Thorin for the share of gold previously promised to the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks the Arkenstone out of Erebor and hands it over to Thranduil and Bard, so that they can trade it for the promised treasures and prevent a battle. Thorin angrily refuses the proposal, while Bilbo chides him for letting greed cloud his judgement. Thorin nearly kills Bilbo but is stopped by Gandalf. Thorin's cousin [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot|D\u00e1in]] arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until Azog's army arrives. The forces of D\u00e1in, Thranduil and Bard, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, immediately band together against the Orcs. A second front is opened when the Orcs attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city.\n\nInside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides with Dwalin, F\u00edli, and K\u00edli to kill Azog. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's arrival, and Bilbo volunteers to relay the news to Thorin, using [[One Ring|his magic ring]] to move through the combat unseen. Azog kills F\u00edli as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. Bolg overpowers Tauriel and then kills K\u00edli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] arrive with Radagast and [[Beorn]], and the Orcs are finally defeated. In the climax, Thorin engages Azog in a duel and kills him, but is fatally wounded in the process. Bilbo makes peace with the dying Thorin, while Tauriel mourns Kili, with Thranduil acknowledging their love. Thranduil advises Legolas to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name [[Aragorn|Strider]]. Thorin is buried with the Arkenstone along with Kili and Fili, and D\u00e1in is crowned king.\n\nAs Thorin's company settles back into Erebor, and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him of it, although Bilbo assures him that he had lost the ring. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He stops the sale and starts tidying up his home, revealing he still possesses the ring. Sixty years later,{{Efn|During the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001).}} Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Hobbit The Battle of Five Armies comic con.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of the Five Armies'' panel at 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC]]]]\n{{Further-text|[[The Hobbit (film series)#Cast|Cast of The Hobbit film series]]|[[The Hobbit (film series)#Casting|Casting of The Hobbit film series]]}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Martin Freeman]]  as [[Bilbo Baggins]]\n** [[Ian Holm]] as [[Bilbo Baggins|Old Bilbo Baggins]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]\n* [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] as [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin II Oakenshield]]<ref name=IBT />\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Legolas]]\n* [[Evangeline Lilly]] as [[Tauriel]]\n* [[Luke Evans]] as [[Bard the Bowman]]\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Smaug]] / [[Sauron]]<ref name=IBT>{{cite web|title=Hobbit Finale Renamed The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hobbit-third-movie-renamed-hobbit-battle-five-armies-1445943|work=[[International Business Times]]|access-date=22 May 2014|first=Ben |last=Skipper|date=24 April 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Thranduil]]<ref name=EmpireOnline1 />\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's company|Dwalin]]\n* [[Ken Stott]] as [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]\n* [[Aidan Turner]] as [[K\u00edli]]<ref name=EmpireOnline1 />\n* [[Dean O'Gorman]] as [[F\u00edli]]\n* [[Manu Bennett]] as [[Azog|Azog the Defiler]]\n* [[Mark Hadlow]] as [[Dori (Middle-earth)#Dori|Dori]]\n* [[Jed Brophy]] as [[Nori (Middle-earth)#Nori|Nori]]\n* [[Adam Brown (actor)|Adam Brown]] as [[Ori (Middle-earth)#Ori|Ori]]\n* [[John Callen]] as [[\u00d3in, son of Gr\u00f3in|\u00d3in]]\n* [[Peter Hambleton]] as [[Gl\u00f3in, son of Gr\u00f3in|Gl\u00f3in]]\n* [[William Kircher]] as [[Bifur]]\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as [[Bofur]]<ref name=EmpireOnline1 />\n* [[Stephen Hunter (actor)|Stephen Hunter]] as [[Bombur (Middle-earth)|Bombur]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Galadriel]]<ref name=IBT />\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Elrond]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Saruman|Saruman the White]]\n* [[Sylvester McCoy]] as [[Radagast the Brown]]\n* [[John Tui]] as Bolg<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538692/?ref_=nv_sr_1|title=Lawrence Makoare|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as [[D\u00e1in II Ironfoot]]\n* [[Mikael Persbrandt]] as [[Beorn]]\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as [[Master of Lake-town]]\n* [[Ryan Gage]] as [[List of original characters in The Hobbit film series#Men|Alfrid Lickspittle]]\n* [[Mark Mitchinson]] as [[List of original characters in The Hobbit film series#Men|Braga]]\n* [[John Bell (Scottish actor)|John Bell]] as Bain\n* Peggy and Mary Nesbitt as [[List of original characters in The Hobbit film series#Tilda and Sigrid|Sigrid and Tilda]]\n* Simon London as [[List of original characters in The Hobbit film series#Elves|Feren]]\n}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Andy Serkis]]'s daughters made cameo appearances as girls rowing away during [[Smaug]]'s attack; movement coach [[Terry Notary]] and stand-in Jamie Haugh appear as Laketown refugees after the destruction; [[Conan Stevens]], who was to play Bolg, appears as the Keeper of the Dungeons, an Orc captain holding Gandalf hostage and the sons of key second assistant director Guy Campbell, casting director Miranda Rivers, and [[Weta Workshop]] founder [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] appear as Hobbit children during the auction scene.\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n{{Further|The Hobbit (film series)#Development}}\n''The Hobbit'' was originally planned as a two-part film, but Jackson confirmed plans for a third film on 30 July 2012, turning his adaptation of ''The Hobbit'' into a trilogy.<ref name=\"THR30712\">{{Cite news |last=Jordan |first=Zakarin |date=30 July 2012 |title=Third 'Hobbit' Film Confirmed |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/third-hobbit-film-confirmed-355817 |access-date=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"PJFB30712\">{{Cite web |last=Jackson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Jackson |date=30 July 2012 |title=An unexpected journey |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/peter-jackson/an-unexpected-journey/10151114596546558 |access-date=30 July 2012 |website=Facebook}}</ref> According to Jackson, the third film would contain the Battle of the Five Armies and make extensive use of the appendices that Tolkien wrote to expand the story of [[Middle-earth]] (published in the back of ''[[The Return of the King]]'').
