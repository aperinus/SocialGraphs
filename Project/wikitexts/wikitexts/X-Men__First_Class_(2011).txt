It is the fourth mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the fifth installment overall. It was directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and produced by [[Bryan Singer]], and stars [[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[January Jones]], [[Oliver Platt]], and [[Kevin Bacon]]. At the time of its release, it was intended to be a franchise reboot<ref name=slashfilm/> and contradicted the events of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (2009); however, the follow-up film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) retconned ''First Class'' into a prequel to ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000). ''First Class'' is set primarily in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and focuses on the relationship between [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (film series character)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]], and the origin of their groups\u2014the [[X-Men]] and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], respectively, as they deal with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] led by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], a mutant supremacist bent on enacting nuclear war.\n\nProducer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] first thought of a prequel based on the young X-Men during the production of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''; producer [[Simon Kinberg]] later suggested to [[20th Century Fox]] an adaptation of the comic series ''[[X-Men: First Class (comics)|X-Men: First Class]]'', although the film does not follow the comic closely. Singer, who had directed both ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''X2'', became involved with the project in 2009, but he could only produce and co-write ''First Class'' due to his work on other projects. Vaughn, who was previously attached to both ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', became the director, and also wrote the final script with his writing partner [[Jane Goldman]]. ''First Class'' replaced a Magneto prequel film that had been in development, but had entered [[development hell]]; the [[Writers Guild of America West|Writers Guild of America]] [[WGA screenwriting credit system|arbitration]] gave a story credit to ''Magneto'' writer [[Sheldon Turner]]. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2010 and concluded in December, with additional filming completed in April 2011. Locations included [[Oxford]], the [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with soundstage work done in both [[Pinewood Studios]] and the 20th Century Fox stages in [[Los Angeles]]. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]] of the period.\n\n''First Class'' premiered on [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] on May 25, 2011, and was released in the United States on June 3, 2011. It was a box office success, becoming the seventh highest-grossing in the film series, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its acting, screenplay, direction, action sequences, visual effects, and musical score. The film's success re-popularized the ''X-Men'' film franchise with various installments following, including a number of sequels focusing on younger iterations of the X-Men characters, with ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014), ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' (2016), and ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 1944, at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], [[Nazi]] officer Klaus Schmidt witnesses young prisoner [[Magneto (film series character)|Erik Lehnsherr]] bend a metal gate with his mind upon being separated from his mother. In his office, Schmidt orders Erik to move a coin on his desk, and kills his mother when Erik couldn't. In grief and anger, Erik's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Separately, at a [[X-Mansion|mansion]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], child [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier]] meets young shapeshifter [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]], whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone \"different\", like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.\n\nIn 1962, Erik is tracking down Schmidt to avenge his mother, while Xavier earns his doctorate from the [[University of Oxford]] as Professor of Genetics. In [[Las Vegas]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Moira MacTaggert]] follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where she sees Schmidt (now called [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]) with mutant telepath [[Emma Frost]], cyclone-producing [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]], and [[teleportation|teleporter]] [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]]. Threatened by Shaw and teleported to the [[National Military Command Center|Joint War Room]], Hendry advocates deploying [[nuclear missile]]s in [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]]. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have kept him young, later kills Hendry.\n\nMoira, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director <!-- He is only credited as McCone in the film -->McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret \"Division X\" facility. Moira and Xavier find Shaw as Erik is attacking him, and rescue Erik from drowning. Shaw escapes. Xavier brings Erik to Division X, where they meet young scientist [[Hank McCoy]], a mutant with [[prehensile feet]], who believes Raven's DNA may provide a \"cure\" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant-locating device [[Cerebro]] to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Erik recruit stripper [[Angel Salvadore]], cabbie [[Darwin (comics)|Armando Mu\u00f1oz]], Army prisoner [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]], and drifter [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]]. They create nicknames, Raven dubbing herself \"Mystique\".\n\nWhen Frost meets with a Soviet general in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and uses her telepathic powers to manipulate him, Xavier and Erik capture her and discover Shaw intends to start [[World War III]], triggering mutant ascendency. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; when Alex and Mu\u00f1oz retaliate, Shaw kills Mu\u00f1oz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR [[Cuban Missile Crisis|install missiles]] in [[Cuba]]. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a U.S. blockade.\n\nMcCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and Moira take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Erik uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Erik seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. While Shaw is helpless, Erik reveals he shares Shaw's [[Chosen people|exclusivist]] view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, uses his power to kill Shaw by slowly pushing a Nazi coin through Shaw's brain, killing him. Unable to risk releasing Shaw, Xavier begs Erik to stop, but is forced to experience the pain of Shaw's death.\n\nBoth fleets fire missiles at the mutants, which Erik turns back in mid-flight. Moira tries to stop Erik by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Erik rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Erik leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. Moira promises Xavier never to reveal his location, but Xavier makes sure of this by wiping her memories. Meanwhile, Erik, along with Mystique and the other Hellfire Club members, frees Frost from confinement and dubs himself \"Magneto\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:James-mcavoy-michael-fassbender-x-men-junket-interview-300x300.jpg|thumb|Actors [[Michael Fassbender]] and [[James McAvoy]] at a press junket|alt=Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy sit in front of the \"X\" logo for Xavier's school.]]\n\n* [[James McAvoy]] as [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier]]: The telepathic mutant leader and founder of the [[X-Men]].
