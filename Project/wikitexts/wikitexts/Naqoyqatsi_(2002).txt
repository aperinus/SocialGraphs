It is the third and final installment in the [[Qatsi trilogy]].\n\n{{transliteration|hop|Naqoyqatsi}} is a [[Hopi language|Hopi]] word (written as {{lang|hop|naq\u00f6\u0300yqatsi}} in [[Hopi language#Orthography|Hopi orthography]]) meaning \"life as war\". In the film's closing credits, Naqoyqatsi is also translated as \"civilized violence\" and \"a life of killing each other\".<ref name=\"qatsi.org\">{{cite web|url=http://qatsi.org/films/naqoyqatsi.php|title=Naqoyqatsi Definitions|work=Koyaanisqatsi.org|publisher=Institute for Regional Education|access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nAccording to Reggio, the film has no screenplay per se, but three movements (like [[movement (music)|those of a symphony]]) with different themes:<ref name=rottentomatoes>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/naqoyqatsi/ Rotten Tomatoes website]: Reviews and long article on Naqoyqatsi, with input and quotations from Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass</ref>\n\n# '''Numerica.com:''' Language and place gives way to numerical code and virtual reality.\n# '''Circus maximus:''' Competition, winning, records, fame, \u201cfair play\u201d and the love of money are elevated to the prime values of life. Life becomes a game.\n# '''Rocketship twentieth century:''' A world that language can no longer describe. The resulting explosive tempo of technology is war and civilized violence.\n\n==Production==\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] took place very close to the film's production studio, impacting the content of the film and further convincing the crew of the importance of its subject.<ref name=rottentomatoes/>\n\nWhile ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'' and ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' examine modern life in industrial countries and the conflict between encroaching industrialization and traditional ways of life, using slow motion and time-lapse footage of cities and natural landscapes, about eighty percent of ''Naqoyqatsi'' uses archive footage and stock images manipulated and processed digitally on [[Non-linear editing]] (non-sequential) [[workstation]]s and intercut with specially-produced [[computer-generated imagery]] to demonstrate society's transition from a natural environment to a technology-based one. Reggio described the process as \"[[Virtual reality|virtual]] cinema\".<ref name=rottentomatoes/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Naqoyqatsi\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Philip Glass]]\n| released     = October 8, 2002\n| label        = [[Sony Masterworks]]\n}}\nThe music is more in the traditional [[orchestra]]l tradition than much of Glass's work as a familiar doorway to images so disconnected from the familiar world. One [[musical instrument|instrument]], the [[cello]] played by [[Yo-Yo Ma]], plays through much of the piece. Some non-orchestral instruments are used in addition to traditional ones, including a [[didgeridoo]] and an [[electronic music|electronically-created]] [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref name=rottentomatoes/>\n\nSoundtrack.net reviewer Glenn McClanan noted that unlike the previous two films, the music is more on the softer side.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/naqoyqatsi/|title=Naqoyqatsi Soundtrack (2002)|website=www.soundtrack.net}}</ref>{{track listing\n| headline = ''Naqoyqatsi: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2002)\n| title1 = Naqoyqatsi\n| length1 = 7:56\n| title2 = Primacy of the Number\n| length2 = 6:52\n| title3 = Massman\n| length3 = 9:48\n| title4 = New World\n| length4 = 3:04\n| title5 = Religion\n| length5 = 9:01\n| title6 = Media Weather\n| length6 = 7:54\n| title7 = Old World\n| length7 = 3:08\n| title8 = Intensive Time\n| length8 = 8:09\n| title9 = Point Blank\n| length9 = 11:17\n| title10 = The Vivid Unknown\n| length10 = 7:08\n| title11 = Definition\n| length11 = 2:50\n| total_length = 79:17\n}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film was released on DVD by Miramax on October 14, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/438418/Naqoyqatsi/home-video-reviews.html|title=Naqoyqatsi (2002) - Home Video Reviews - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Naqoyqatsi-Belladonna/dp/B00005JLIA/ref=tmm_dvd_title_1?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= Amazon.com]</ref>\n\n[[The Criterion Collection]] released this as part of the Qatsi trilogy on December 11, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/58160/qatsi-trilogy-the/|title=The Qatsi Trilogy (Koyaanisqatsi / Powaqqatsi / Naqoyqatsi) - Criterion Collection (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 48% out of 52 reviews were positive with the average score of 5.82/10, and the consensus saying that it is \"the weakest film in Reggio's trilogy\".<ref name=\"rottent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/naqoyqatsi/ |title=Naqoyqatsi (Naqoyqatsi: Life as War) (2002) - Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2013-04-26 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'': Life Out of Balance (1982)\n* ''[[Chronos (film)|Chronos]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'': Life in Transformation (1988)\n* ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Samsara (2011 film)|Samsara]]'' (2011)\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Philip Glass-Naqoyqatsi.ogg\n|title=Music by Philip Glass\n|description=From ''Naqoyqatsi'' by [[Philip Glass]]}}\n*[http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org The Trilogy's Home Page]\n*{{IMDb title|0145937}}\n* {{Amg movie|267165}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2592-the-qatsi-trilogy-celebration-and-warning ''The Qatsi Trilogy: Celebration and Warning''] an essay by Scott MacDonald at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Qatsi trilogy}}\n{{Philip Glass}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:2002 documentary films]]\n[[Category:American avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Philip Glass]]\n[[Category:Films without speech]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Godfrey Reggio]]\n[[Category:Non-narrative films]]\n[[Category:Collage film]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
