Starring [[Steven Seagal]], the film is loosely based on the novel ''[[The Last Canadian]]'' by [[William C. Heine]]. Seagal's first [[direct-to-video]] film, it features him as a local doctor and former immunologist who races against time to find a cure for an active viral outbreak, the origins of which trace back to a militia leader who injected himself with a deadly virus.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on 10 July 1998 and in USA on 6 February 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nNear the town of [[Ennis, Montana|Ennis]], [[Montana]], local doctor and former government research immunologist Wesley McClaren ([[Steven Seagal]]) who has an interest in [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and is also a weapons and self-defense expert, is called to a hospital when people start dying from an unknown but very deadly disease. He determines that the cause is a highly dangerous airborne [[virus]] and calls in a Biological Response team, who seal off the town while doctors start treating sufferers with a vaccine. Unfortunately for them, several have already died.\n\nThe source of the virus is traced to a local self-styled [[Rebellion|rebel]] [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] leader, Floyd Chisholm ([[Gailard Sartain]]), who has given himself up after a long siege and has been arrested on weapons charges. In court, having ingested the virus himself (believing that he also possesses the vaccine) he spits at the judge, and starts the rapid spread of the disease.\n\nFloyd's [[militia]] followers, who have been allowed to go free, attack the prison and rescue Floyd. They then proceed to invade and besiege the hospital, with much loss of life, and take medical personnel hostage including Wesley and his daughter Holly ([[Camilla Belle]]). But too late, they realize that the vaccine they were seeking at the hospital is the same as the one they possess which only delays the effect of the deadly virus.\nWorking at gunpoint, Wesley takes a sample of Holly's blood; it shows that Holly has been infected, but somehow her body is fighting it off. Wesley and Holly contrive to escape and travel to a farm where Holly's grandfather lives. Wesley takes a blood sample from his friend Dr. Ann White Cloud (Whitney Yellow Robe), and realizes that her body is also fighting off the infection.\n\nWesley and Ann gain access to a secret underground laboratory where Wesley used to work, where they hope to come up with a cure. Wesley finds out why Ann and Holly are not being affected by the virus: they have been drinking tea made with a specific wild herb that is known to Native American healers.\n\nBack at the hospital, Wesley and Holly are captured by the militia, but he manages to kill Floyd and disable the other soldiers. As soon as the biological protection team learn of the cure, they go out and pick all the flowers they can find and drop them by helicopter over the town, telling the people to boil them and drink the liquid.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Dr. Wesley McClaren\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as Floyd Chisholm\n* [[L.

Several writers, including [[David Ayer]] and Paul Mones<ref name=\"Vern\"/> were rumored to be working on the script prior to its release; Mones was ultimately credited as a producer. Though the movie is credited as an adaptation of [[William C. Heine|William C.

No character names, events, or even locations appear in both the book and the film.<ref name=\"Vern\"/>\n\nThe film is Seagal's only effort to date in which he co-stars with his daughter, actress [[Ayako Fujitani]], and is notable for an extremely low amount of action scenes compared to Seagal's other work.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film has received generally negative reviews.\n\nDavid Nusair of Reel Film Reviews called it \"dull\" and criticized its lack of action (he claims, \"Out of a 90 minute movie, there's maybe 10 minutes of actual Seagal hand-to-hand combat\") and unwelcome political messages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mini Reviews (January 2001)|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini2.htm#patriot|author=David Nusair|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[Seagalogy]]'' author Vern argues that \"in many ways ''The Patriot'' is an admirable effort,\" noting \"The production values and acting are better than some of Seagal's subsequent movies,\" but going on to point out that due to its \"ridiculously low action quotient it is a least-favorite of many Seagal fans.\"<ref name=Vern/> As of 2 October 2014, the film has a 22% \"rotten\" critics rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (based on 9 reviews).<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1085744-patriot/|title=The Patriot - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0120786}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Patriot, The}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about bioterrorism]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video action films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]\n[[Category:Films about infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Films based on Canadian novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Montana]]\n[[Category:Films set in hospitals]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
