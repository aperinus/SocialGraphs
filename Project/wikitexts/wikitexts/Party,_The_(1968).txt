The film has a very loose structure, and essentially serves as a series of set pieces for Sellers's [[improvisational comedy]] talents.<ref name=\"champlin1968\">Champlin, Charles (March 15, 1968). An open invitation to play it off the cuff. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref> Based on a [[wiktionary:fish out of water|fish-out-of-water]] premise, the film is about a bungling actor from [[India]], Hrundi V. Bakshi (portrayed by Sellers), who accidentally gets invited to a lavish [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] dinner party and \"makes terrible mistakes based upon ignorance of Western ways\".<ref name=\"lehman1981\">{{cite book | last1 = Luhr | first1 = William | last2 = Lehman | first2 = Peter | year = 1981 | title = Blake Edwards | volume = 1 | publisher = Ohio University Press | isbn = 978-0-8214-0605-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/blakeedwards00lehm/page/140 140] | url = https://archive.org/details/blakeedwards00lehm/page/140 }}</ref>\n\nThe protagonist Hrundi Bakshi was influenced by two of Sellers' earlier characters: the Indian doctor Ahmed el Kabir in ''[[The Millionairess]]'' (1960) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' series.

Unknown Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi ([[Peter Sellers]]) plays a bugler, but continues to play after repeatedly being shot and after the director ([[Herb Ellis (actor)|Herb Ellis]]) yells \"cut.\" Hrundi accidentally blows up an enormous fort [[Set construction|set]] rigged with explosives. The director fires Hrundi immediately and calls the studio head, General Fred R. Clutterbuck ([[J. Edward McKinley]]). Clutterbuck writes down Hrundi's name to [[blacklist]] him, but he inadvertently writes it on the guest list of his upcoming dinner party.\n\nHrundi receives his invitation and drives to the party. Upon parking his car, he steps into mud. Hrundi tries to rinse the mud off his shoe in a pool that flows through the house, but he loses his shoe. After many failures, he is reunited with his shoe served to him on a silver platter by one of the waiters.\n\nHrundi has awkward interactions with everyone at the party, including Clutterbuck's dog, Cookie. He meets famous [[Western movie]] actor \"Wyoming Bill\" Kelso ([[Denny Miller]]), who gives Hrundi an autograph. Hrundi later accidentally shoots Kelso with a toy gun, but Kelso doesn't see who did it. Hrundi feeds a caged [[macaw]] food from a container marked \"Birdie Num Num\" and drops the food on the floor. Hrundi at various times during the film activates a panel of electronics that control the intercom, a copy of the ''[[Manneken Pis]]'' (soaking a guest), and a retractable bar (while Clutterbuck is sitting at it). After Kelso hurts Hrundi's hand while shaking it (\"My goodness, I would have been disappointed if you hadn't crushed my hand\"), Hrundi sticks his hand into a bowl of crushed ice containing caviar. While waiting to wash his hand, he meets aspiring actress Mich\u00e8le Monet ([[Claudine Longet]]), who came with producer C.S. Divot ([[Gavin MacLeod]]). Hrundi shakes Divot's hand, and Divot then shakes hands with other guests, passing around the fishy odor, and back to Hrundi after he has washed his hand.\n\nAt dinner, Hrundi's place setting by the kitchen door has a very low chair that puts his chin near the table. An increasingly drunk waiter, Levinson ([[Steve Franken]]), tries to serve dinner and fights with the other staff. During the main course, Hrundi's roast chicken catapults off his fork and becomes impaled on a guest's tiara. Hrundi asks Levinson to retrieve his meal, but the woman's wig comes off along with her tiara, as she obliviously engages in conversation. Levinson ends up brawling with other waiting staff, and dinner is disrupted.\n\nHrundi apologizes to his hosts; then needs to go to the bathroom. He wanders through the house, opening doors and barging in on various servants and guests in embarrassing situations. He ends up in the backyard, where he accidentally sets off the irrigation sprinklers. At Divot's insistence, Mich\u00e8le gives an impromptu guitar performance of \"Nothing to Lose\" to impress the guests. Hrundi goes upstairs, where he saves Mich\u00e8le from Divot's unwanted advances by dislodging Divot's toupee. Hrundi finally finds a bathroom, but he breaks the toilet, drops a painting in it, gets toilet paper everywhere, and floods the bathroom. To avoid being discovered Hrundi sneaks onto the roof and falls into the pool. Mich\u00e8le leaps in to save him, but he's then coerced to drink alcohol to warm up. A Russian dance troupe arrives at the party. Upstairs, Hrundi finds Mich\u00e8le crying in the next room and consoles her. Divot bursts in and demands Mich\u00e8le leave with him. Mich\u00e8le says no, and Divot cancels her [[screen test]] the next day. Hrundi persuades her to stay and have a good time with him. They return to the party in borrowed clothes. The party gets wilder, and Hrundi offers to retract the bar to make room for dancing. Instead, he opens a retractable floor with a pool underneath, causing guests to fall in the pool. Levinson makes more floors retract, and more guests fall in. Clutterbuck's daughter arrives with friends and a baby elephant painted with \"THE WORLD IS FLAT\" on its forehead and [[hippie]] slogans over its body. Hrundi takes offense and asks them to wash the elephant. The entire house is soon filled with soap bubbles.\n\nBack at his home, Divot suddenly realizes that Hrundi is the fired actor who blew up the set, and he races back to the party. As the band plays on, Clutterbuck tries to save his suds-covered paintings. The air conditioning blows suds everywhere as the guests dance to [[psychedelic music]], and Clutterbuck's distraught wife falls into the pool three times. Divot pulls up as the police and fire department personnel work to resolve everything. Hrundi apologizes one last time to Clutterbuck as Divot reveals who Hrundi is, but Clutterbuck accidentally chokes the headwaiter instead of Hrundi. Kelso gives Hrundi an autographed photo and [[Stetson hat]] as Hrundi and Mich\u00e8le leave in Hrundi's [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]] three-wheeler car. Outside her apartment, Hrundi and Mich\u00e8le appear on the verge of admitting that they have fallen for each other. Hrundi gives Mich\u00e8le the hat as a keepsake, and she says he can come get it any time. Hrundi suggests he could come by next week, and she readily agrees. Hrundi smiles and drives off as his car backfires.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Hrundi V.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''The Party'' was the only non-[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]] collaboration  between Sellers and Edwards. Producer [[Walter Mirisch]] knew that Sellers and Edwards were considered liabilities; in his autobiography, Mirisch wrote \"Blake had achieved a reputation as a very expensive director, particularly after ''[[The Great Race]]''.\"<ref name=\"mirisch2008\">{{cite book | last=Mirisch | first=Walter | title=I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History | location=Madison, Wisconsin | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-299-22640-4}}</ref> Sellers had played an Indian man (Dr. Ahmed el Kabir) in his hit film ''[[The Millionairess]]'' (1960), and another Indian physician in '' [[The Road to Hong Kong]]'' (1962). He is mostly remembered as a similar klutz as [[Inspector Clouseau]] in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' series.\n\nThe film started shooting in May under the title ''RSVP''.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Sellers' Market for Comedy: A Sellers' Market for Comedy|last=Champlin|first= Charles|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=14 May 1967|page= c1}}</ref>\n\nThe film's interiors were shot on a set, at the [[MGM]] lot, though this may be a mistake as IMDb lists the Samuel Goldwyn Studios on Formosa as the correct address, likely as other Mirisch Productions, including ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', were shot there as well. The original script was only 63 pages in length.<ref name=\"aushenker2008\" /> Edwards later said it was the shortest script he ever shot from, and the majority of the content in the film was improvised on set.\n\nThe film draws much inspiration from the works of [[Jacques Tati]]; Bakshi arrives at the party in a [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]] three-wheeler which may suggest [[Monsieur Hulot]]'s car in ''[[Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]''. However, it was not the same car ([[Salmson]] AL3). The entire film storyline is reminiscent of the Royal Garden restaurant sequence of ''[[Playtime]]'', and the comedic interaction with inanimate objects and gadgets parallels several of Tati's films, especially ''[[Mon Oncle]]''.<ref name=\"robinson2002\">Robinson, Tasha (April 19, 2002).

Mancini, commenting on audience reactions, noted \"That's what I get for writing a nice song for a comedy. Nobody's going to hear a note of it.\"<ref name=\"champlin1968\" /> During a scene later in the film, the band can be heard playing \"[[It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio stasera)]]\", a song Mancini composed for the first ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|Pink Panther]]'' film.
