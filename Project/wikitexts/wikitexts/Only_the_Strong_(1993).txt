It is considered to be the only [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] film that showcases [[capoeira]], an Afro-Brazilian [[Martial arts|martial art]], from beginning to end.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] Louis Stevens ([[Mark Dacascos]]) returns to his hometown of [[Miami]] after completing military service in [[Brazil]], only to learn that his old high school has become a haven for gangs and drug dealers. After Stevens uses his capoeira skills to kick several drug dealers off the school property, Mr. Kerrigan ([[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]), one of Stevens' old teachers, sees the impact that Stevens has on the students. Kerrigan gives him the task of teaching capoeira to a handful of the worst at-risk students at the school, giving Stevens an abandoned fire station as their practice area. While doing so, Stevens earns the ire of the local drug lord, Silverio Aliveres (Paco Christian Prieto), whose younger cousin, Orlando Aliveres (Richard Coca), is one of Stevens' students. Silverio is also a master of capoeira, and he engages Stevens in combat, beating him viciously. The horrified Orlando resolves to learn everything he can from Stevens. Stevens' class learns quickly, and they become very skilled at capoeira. The principal, delighted, proposes a district-wide capoeira program to the school board. After a field trip with his class, Stevens once again clashes with Silverio, who declares war against him.\n\nSilverio's gang terrorizes the high school and sets fire to Kerrigan's classroom, resulting in the death of one of Stevens' students. As a result of this incident, Stevens is accused at fault, banished from the school grounds and the capoeira program is terminated. In retaliation to the attack, Stevens sneaks into Silverio's [[chop shop]] and defeats the workers before setting a cash-filled car on fire. Furious, Silverio orders the gang to bring Stevens to him alive. Orlando flees to get help. After a desperate battle, Stevens is finally captured and brought to a bonfire, where Silverio awaits. However, Stevens' capoeira students bar their path in an attempt to rescue their teacher. Before a brawl can ensue, the exhausted Stevens challenges Silverio to single combat to win back his students. After a grueling battle, Stevens defeats Silverio before the police arrive, sending the gang scattering in all directions. With this defeat, Silverio's reputation as crime lord is gone.\n\nStevens' capoeira program proves such a success that his students graduate from high school. To celebrate, they join a Brazilian capoeira team to perform for Stevens at the graduation ceremony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Dacascos]] as Louis Stevens\n* [[Stacey Travis]] as Dianna\n* Paco Christian Prieto as Silverio Aliveres\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Mr. Kerrigan\n* [[Todd Susman]] as Mr. Cochran\n* [[Jeffrey Anderson-Gunter]] as Philippe\n* Richard Coca as Orlando Aliveres\n* Roman Cardwell as Shay\n* [[Ryan Bollman]] as Donovan\n* Christian Klemash as Eddie\n* John Fionte as Hector Cervantes\n* John Gregory Kasper as Coach Kasper\n* Phyllis Sukoff as Mrs. Esposito\n* [[Mellow Man Ace]] as Student Rapper\n* [[Stuart S.
