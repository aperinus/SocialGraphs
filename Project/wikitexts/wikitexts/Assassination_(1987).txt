On the day before the Inauguration of the new president, Killian has just returned from a six-week sick leave. He is given a new assignment: to protect the First Lady, Lara Royce Craig ([[Jill Ireland]]).\n\nBeing highly qualified and a seasoned veteran of the service, Killian is dismayed that he is not on the Presidential detail. To make matters worse, Lara proves to be an extremely difficult charge. She is arrogant, condescending, demanding, and she detests the presence of Killian.\n\nWith the First Lady doing what she wants and ignoring all of Killian's suggestions, it becomes apparent that someone wants Lara dead\u2014especially when a biker tries to shoot her.\n\nA wild cross-country adventure ensues as Killian attempts to protect Lara and flush out the assassin and his contractor\u2014and the assassination attempts may have originated from the [[White House]].\n\nIt turns out that, because of a war injury, the President is impotent and his wife is about to file for divorce at the end of his first term. Believing that the divorce will eliminate the chances of another term, the president's right-wing supporters staged the assassination attempts, to keep the President's impotence a secret and gain him the people\u2019s support in his grief.\n\nKillian is able to unravel the conspiracy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as Jay Killian\n* [[Jill Ireland]] as First Lady Lara Royce Craig\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Fitzroy\n* [[Jan Gan Boyd]] as Charlotte Chang \n* [[Randy Brooks (actor)|Randy Brooks]] as Tyler Loudermilk \n* James Lemp as Eddie Bracken \n* [[Michael Ansara]] as Senator Hector Bunsen \n* James Staley as Briggs \n* [[Kathryn Leigh Scott]] as Polly Sims \n* [[Jim McMullan]] as The Zipper \n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as H.H.
