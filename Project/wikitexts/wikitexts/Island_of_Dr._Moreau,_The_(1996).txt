Aboard, Dr Montgomery tends to him and, after telling him the boat has no [[radio]], he promises Douglas the captain will take him to [[Timor]]. However, when they arrive at Montgomery's destination, referred to as \"Moreau's Island\", he instead advises Douglas to disembark so he can use the radio on the island.\n\nMontgomery unloads a shipment of [[rabbit]]s at a pen where he kills one for Douglas' meal. They go to the Main House, where Douglas is warned not to wander. He meets a daughter of Dr. Moreau's called Aissa, but Montgomery turns him away from her and leads him to his room. On the way, they discuss how Moreau vanished after becoming obsessed with his animal research. Montgomery locks Douglas in his room, but he escapes that night. He finds a [[laboratory]] where he witnesses the birth of a mutant baby, belonging to and delivered by human-animal [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s.\n\nHe is noticed, escapes, and runs into Aissa who leads him to the village of the mutants. They find the partially eaten carcass of a rabbit near the [[leopard]] hybrid called Lo-Mai. At the village, they find the Sayer of the Law whose Law preaches \"being human\" in terms of restraint and discipline. Dr. Moreau, referred to as \"the Father\" by the mutants, appears. He inflicts pain on the villagers by using a remote control to activate an implant under the creatures' skin as a form of subjugation. Moreau forces the village to release Douglas and demands Montgomery give Douglas his handgun. Moreau then calmly discusses the situation with Douglas.\n\nDouglas, Montgomery and Moreau gather and he introduces his hybrid \"children\". He explains his creations: he introduced human [[DNA]] into animals in search of a higher being, incapable of harm. The existing Beast Folk are imperfect, but Moreau claims to be very close to a solution. Moreau's son Azazello comes in with the rabbit, to the disgust of the pacifistic Moreau who forbids meat-eating. When he learns of the eaten rabbit, he promises that there will be a [[trial (law)|trial]] the next day. Douglas tries to escape by boat, but it is overrun with humanoid [[rat]]s.\n\nAt the trial, Azazello unexpectedly shoots Lo-Mai. His body is burned and a mutant called Hyena-Swine comes, notices the pain implant among his remains, then removes his own. Montgomery reveals to Douglas that in addition to the pain, the animals are controlled through regular drugging to prevent them from \"retrogressing\". Hyena-Swine reveals the removed implant and so Montgomery sets the other beasts after him. Meanwhile, Douglas tries to contact the outside world, but Montgomery sabotages the radio and Aissa reveals to Moreau that she is regressing as it shows her with [[cat]]-themed eyes.\n\nHyena-Swine and his trackers (now on his side and also free of implants) break into the House and confront Moreau. Angry over their hybrid nature and no longer under his control, they reject humanity and the Law when they kill Moreau. His children grieve, except for Azazello, who steals Montgomery's [[handgun]] and goes to join Hyena-Swine's faction. Aissa informs Douglas that he can stop her regression with a serum from the lab. However, it turns out Montgomery has gone insane and destroyed it. Douglas also finds samples and a file with his name on them and finds out that Moreau was planning to use his DNA to stop Aissa's regression permanently, completing his experiments. Meanwhile, Azazello leads the mutants to the armory.\n\nThe mutants have now taken over the island. Azazello shoots a drunken Montgomery dead at the village and Hyena-Swine's faction rampages around the island. Azazello hangs Aissa before being executed by Hyena-Swine, having outlived his usefulness; but Douglas manages to survive by telling Hyena-Swine to impose his leadership and be \"God Number One\" among the others of his faction, especially those who helped him kill Moreau, causing Hyena-Swine to kill his supporters. While he's distracted, M'Ling, another one of Moreau's sons, triggers an explosion that causes Hyena-Swine to lose his gun and allows Douglas to escape. Hyena-Swine, finding himself outnumbered and defenseless, retreats into the burning building where he burns alive.\n\nThe Sayer of the Law, Majai, and Assassimon see off Douglas as he leaves on a raft. The Sayer of the Law tells Douglas that the hybrids are wanting to return to their natural state of being and believes it is better, so as to end their creator's work. In closing narration, Douglas reflects on the comparable savagery that can emerge in humans and claims that he leaves the island \"in fear\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Dr. Moreau, a [[mad scientist]] who created the Beast Folk, trying to forge the perfect species.\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Dr. Montgomery, a former [[neurosurgeon]] who is a [[Veterinary physician|vet]] and enforcer on Dr. Moreau's island.\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Edward Douglas, a [[U.N.]] agent who gets stranded in the middle of the ocean and comes to the island.\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Aissa, a [[cat]]-themed hybrid and Moreau's \"daughter\", who looks more human than the other hybrids and becomes Douglas's love interest.\n* Daniel Rigney as Hyena-Swine, a vicious [[hyena]] and [[pig]] hybrid.\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Azazello, a [[dog]]-themed hybrid and Moreau's \"son\", who is assigned to find the hybrids.\n* [[Nelson de la Rosa]] as Majai, a miniature version of Dr. Moreau who does not speak.\n* Peter Elliott as Assassimon, a [[baboon]]-themed hybrid who is the only [[primate]] hybrid and ''Five Finger Man''.

He spent four years developing the project before getting the [[green-light]] from [[New Line Cinema]]. Although Stanley had envisaged [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] in the lead role, New Line managed to secure Marlon Brando, but some time later, Stanley learned that New Line had gone behind his back and offered the movie to director [[Roman Polanski]].<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\nFurious, Stanley demanded a meeting with Brando who, unexpectedly, proved very sympathetic to Stanley's vision, not least because of Stanley's intimate understanding of the novel and its history - including its connections with [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (the main inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola's ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'') - and because of Stanley's own family relation to legendary African explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]], one of the chief inspirations for Conrad's lead character, Kurtz. According to Stanley, Brando was still fascinated by Kurtz more than 15 years after he had played a version of the character in Coppola's film.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\nWith Brando supporting him, Stanley was confirmed as director, and he was also able to recruit two more major stars: [[Bruce Willis]] as Edward Prendick, a U.N. negotiator who washes up on Moreau's island after his plane crashes, and [[James Woods]] as Montgomery, Moreau's chief assistant. Buoyed by these developments, Stanley enthusiastically launched into pre-production, collaborating with special effects creator [[Stan Winston]] on the creation of makeup and costumes for Moreau's hybrid creatures and preparing the location and sets. As the time for principal photography approached, however, problems began to multiply: Bruce Willis dropped out of the film (Stanley says in ''Lost Soul'' that the actor was divorcing his wife, [[Demi Moore]], at the time, but the couple did not announce their separation until the summer of 1998,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gliatto|first1=Tom|title=Dreams Die Hard|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-dreams-die-hard-vol-49-no-27/|website=People.com|publisher=Time Inc.|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref> with the divorce made final two years later).\n\nHe was replaced with [[Val Kilmer]], who, to Stanley's dismay, demanded a 40% reduction in the number of days he was required on set. Stanley solved this problem when he had the idea to switch Kilmer from the protagonist to the supporting role of Montgomery, who had far less screen time.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\">''[[Lost Soul (2014 film)|Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau]]''</ref> However, this meant James Woods had to leave the production. New Line hurriedly recruited former ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' star [[Rob Morrow]] for the lead role. Another significant setback occurred not long before filming began, with the suicide of Brando's daughter [[Cheyenne Brando|Cheyenne]] - the devastated star retreated to his private island, leaving Stanley and his producers in limbo, not knowing when or even if he would show up.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\n===Shooting===\n====Stanley as director====\nThe chosen location for the film was the rain forest outside [[Cairns]] in [[North Queensland]], Australia. Tensions between Stanley and New Line had been growing during pre-production, partly because of Stanley's quirky, insular nature, and his marked unwillingness to attend studio meetings, but they reached crisis point within the first few days of filming. Stanley's vulnerability to studio pressure was exacerbated by the continuing absence of his main ally, Brando, but the biggest problem proved to be the notorious on-set behaviour of Kilmer, who reportedly arrived two days late.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\nKilmer later attributed his obnoxious behaviour to the fact that, just as filming began, he learned from a television report that he was being sued for divorce by his wife of seven years, [[Joanne Whalley]].<ref name=\"OSull\">{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Kevin|title=Kilmer Gets the Knife; He's Voted Least Popular by a Bunch of H'wood Big Shots|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/kilmer-knife-voted-popular-bunch-h-wood-big-shots-article-1.717644|website=NYDailyNews.com|access-date=10 May 2017|date=June 23, 1996}}</ref> Whatever his reasons, many of the cast and crew have testified to Kilmer's bullying and his consistently hostile and obstructive manner during the first days of shooting. He would not deliver the dialogue as scripted and repeatedly criticized Stanley's ideas; what little footage was shot was deemed unusable.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\nThe studio mainly seems to have blamed the director for not getting Kilmer under control,<ref name=\"OSull\"/><ref name=\"Ascher-Walsh\">{{cite magazine|first=Rebecca |last=Ascher-Walsh |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292752,00.html|title=Psycho Kilmer| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=May 31, 1996|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> but another significant factor was the sudden departure of co-star Rob Morrow on the second day of shooting. With the location being pounded by bad weather that had temporarily stopped filming, Morrow found himself unable to bear the tension and hostility on set any longer, so he telephoned New Line chairman Rob Shaye in Hollywood and tearfully begged to be let go. Shaye agreed.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\" />\n\nAfter a third day of filming, following emergency consultations with its on-set executives, New Line abruptly fired Stanley by fax. The beleaguered director reacted angrily, shredding documents in revenge and then vanishing after being delivered to the airport for the return flight to Hollywood. The reasons for Stanley's dismissal were not made clear and false rumours were spread about his allegedly erratic behaviour, but the main reasons appear to have been his perceived unwillingness to deal with studio executives and especially his problems in dealing with Kilmer, whose already well-established reputation for being \"difficult\" was soon to be enshrined in movie lore thanks to this film.<ref name=\"OSull\"/>\n\nStanley had been offered his full fee on condition that he leave the production quietly and not speak about his firing, so his disappearance caused consternation at New Line, who feared he might try to sabotage the filming. His removal also predictably sent shock waves through the cast and crew. Outraged female lead [[Fairuza Balk]] stormed off the set after a heated exchange with New Line executives and then had a production assistant drive her all the way from Cairns to Sydney - a distance of some 2,500&nbsp;km - in a rented limousine. By her own account, however, Balk's agent then warned her in blunt terms that the studio would ruin her and that she would never work in films again if she broke her contract, so she was soon forced to return to the set.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\"/>\n\n====Frankenheimer as director====\nWith a potential disaster looming, New Line brought in veteran director [[John Frankenheimer]]. He came on board in part because - like virtually every member of the cast and crew - he wanted the opportunity to work with the legendary Brando,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/nov/20/features1|title=My not so brilliant career|last=Frankenheimer|first=John|date=1998-11-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}</ref> but he also used the studio's desperation to his advantage, successfully demanding a hefty fee and a three-picture deal in exchange for his services. Well-known as one of the last of the \"old style\" Hollywood directors, Frankenheimer's gruff, dictatorial approach was radically different from Stanley's and he soon alienated many of the cast and crew. Brando agreed to his decision to have the then-current script by [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]], [[Michael Herr]] and [[Walon Green]] rewritten by Frankenheimer's previous collaborator [[Ron Hutchinson (screenwriter)|Ron Hutchinson]]. Frankenheimer also needed to find a new lead actor to replace Rob Morrow and brought in [[David Thewlis]] to play Douglas. The whole production was shut down for a week and a half while these changes were implemented.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perlmanpages.com/bsmovies/drmoreau.htm |title=RON PERLMAN IN \"THE ISLAND OF Dr MOREAU\" |access-date=2015-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522085847/http://www.perlmanpages.com/bsmovies/drmoreau.htm |archive-date=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n\nOnce shooting resumed, the problems continued and escalated. Brando routinely spent hours in his air-conditioned trailer when he was supposed to be on camera, while actors and extras sweltered in the tropical heat in full make-up and heavy costumes. The antipathy between Brando and Kilmer rapidly escalated into open hostility and on one occasion, as recounted in ''Lost Soul'', this resulted in the cast and crew being kept waiting for hours, with each actor refusing to come out of his respective trailer before the other. New script pages were turned in only a few days before they were shot. Frankenheimer and Kilmer had an argument on-set, which reportedly got so heated, Frankenheimer stated afterwards, \"I don't like Val Kilmer, I don't like his work ethic, and I don't want to be associated with him ever again\".<ref name=\"Ascher-Walsh\"/>\n\nAccording to Thewlis, \"we all had different ideas of where it should go. I even ended up improvising some of the main scenes with Marlon\". Thewlis went on to rewrite his character personally.<ref name=\"everythingisundercontrol1\"/> The constant rewrites also got on Brando's nerves and, as on many previous productions, he refused to learn lines, so he was equipped with a small radio receiver, so that his assistant could feed his lines to him as he performed - a technique he had used on earlier films.<ref name=\"Lost Soul\"/>\n\nThewlis recollected that Brando would \"be in the middle of a scene and suddenly he'd be picking up police messages and would repeat, 'There's a robbery at Woolworth's'\".<ref name=\"everythingisundercontrol1\"/> Meanwhile, friction between him and Kilmer elicited the former's quip:  \"Your problem is you confuse the size of your paycheck with the size of your talent\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vR_PBAAAQBAJ|title=American Film Tales|last=Cettl|first=Robert|page=82|publisher=Robert Cettl|date=2014|isbn=9780987456236}}</ref> Upon completion of Kilmer's final scene, Frankenheimer is reported to have said to the crew, \"Now get that bastard off my set\".<ref name=\"Lost Soul\"/><ref name=\"everythingisundercontrol1\"/> Kilmer denied having a feud with Brando. He shared some behind-the-scenes footage of friendly moments he had with Brando as well as his complaining to Thewlis about Frankenheimer in the documentary ''Val'' (2021). In his memoir ''I'm Your Huckleberry'', Kilmer said \"John Frankenheimer went on to blame me publicly for ruining the movie.
