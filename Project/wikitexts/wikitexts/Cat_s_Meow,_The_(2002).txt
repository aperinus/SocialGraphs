The screenplay by [[Steven Peros]] is based on his 1997 play of the same title, which was inspired by the mysterious death of film mogul [[Thomas H. Ince]] that occurred on [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s yacht during a weekend cruise celebrating Ince's birthday in November 1924. Among those in attendance were Hearst's longtime companion and film actress [[Marion Davies]], fellow actor [[Charlie Chaplin]], writer [[Elinor Glyn]], columnist [[Louella Parsons]], and actress [[Margaret Livingston]]. The film provides a speculative assessment on the unclear manner of Ince's death.\n\nAn international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, ''The Cat's Meow'' was primarily shot in [[Greece]], which served as a stand-in for coastal [[Southern California]]. The film premiered at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in 2001, and was released theatrically in the United States by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] in April 2002. It grossed $3.6 million worldwide, and received largely favorable reviews from film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 15, 1924, various individuals board the luxury yacht ''[[USS Oneida (SP-432)|Oneida]]'' in [[San Pedro, California]], including its owner, publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]], and his mistress, [[silent film]] star [[Marion Davies]]; motion picture mogul [[Thomas H. Ince]], whose birthday is the reason for the weekend cruise, and his mistress, starlet [[Margaret Livingston]] (who would portray \"the Woman From the City\" in [[F.W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' three years later); international film star [[Charlie Chaplin]]; English writer [[Elinor Glyn]]; and [[Louella Parsons]], a film critic for Hearst's ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]''.\n\nSeveral of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of ''[[A Woman of Paris]]'' and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old [[Lita Grey]] (who appeared in his film ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''), is in the midst of preparing ''[[The Gold Rush]]''. Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Pictures]]. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.\n\nHearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.\n\nArmed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn.  Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin.  She states \"I never loved him\" just as Hearst arrives behind them.  Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince.  The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.\n\nHearst arranges to dock in [[San Diego]] and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted [[suicide]] when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the [[Hearst Corporation]], thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.\n\nAfter seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.\n\nThe film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them:\n* Livingston went on to star in a number of successful films and her film salary \"inexplicably\" went from $300 to $1000 a film.\n* Davies starred in more of Hearst's films before finally being allowed to feature in a comedy ''[[Show People]] (1928),'' which was (as Chaplin predicted) a success and included a couple of [[cameo appearance]]s by Chaplin. She stayed by Hearst's side until his death in 1951.\n* Chaplin married his teenage lover [[Lita Grey]] in [[Mexico]] and his film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' was an overwhelming success.\n* Parsons worked for Hearst for many years and subsequently became one of the most successful writers in the history of American journalism.\n\nTom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death. Very few newspapers reported it, no police action was taken, and of all the people on board only one was ever questioned. It is concluded that in Hollywood, \"the place just off the coast of the planet Earth,\" no two accounts of the story are the same.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as [[Marion Davies]]\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as [[William Randolph Hearst]]\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as [[Charlie Chaplin]]\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[Thomas H.

According to Kael, the only trace of the subplot left in the script is a speech made by Susan Alexander, who was loosely based on Davies, to the reporter Thompson about Kane: \u201cLook, if you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll get in touch with Raymond. He\u2019s the butler. You\u2019ll learn a lot from him. He knows where all the bodies are buried.\u201d Kael writes, \u201cIt\u2019s an odd, cryptic speech.

(Black-and-white scenes of Ince's funeral, resembling old [[newsreel]] footage, bookend the film.) To compensate, the director ordered [[costume design]]er Caroline de Vivaise to dress the cast in only black and white. With only a few weeks to prepare prior to the start of filming, she resorted to shopping in secondhand stores for vintage clothing. Bogdanovich agreed to her request to have some silver and gold on the costumes when many of the pieces she found were trimmed with those colors.\n\nThe vessel used to represent the Oneida was actually the ''Marala''. She was originally named ''Evadne'', the private yacht of [[Charles Richard Fairey|Charles Fairey]] of [[Fairey Aviation]], and had patrolled the approaches to [[Bermuda]], and its [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], during the [[Second World War]] as [[HMS Evadne|HMS ''Evadne'']].\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[Ian Whitcomb]]'s score was augmented by original recordings that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. These included \"[[Avalon (Al Jolson song)|Avalon]],\" \"Toot Toot Tootsie,\" and \"California, Here I Come\" by [[Al Jolson]]; \"Everybody Loves My Baby\" and \"Wild Cat Blues\" by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]; \"Stumbling,\" \"Say It With Music,\" \"Somebody Loves Me,\" and \"Linger Awhile\" by [[Paul Whiteman]]; and \"Wabash Blues\" by [[Fletcher Henderson]]. In addition, Ian Whitcomb & His Bungalow Boys performed many tunes from the era, among them \"Ain't We Got Fun,\" \"I'm Just Wild About Harry,\" \"[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]],\" \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,\" \"I'm Nobody's Baby,\" \"Rose of Washington Square,\" \"If You Were the Only Girl in the World,\" \"[[Margie (song)|Margie]],\" \"How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?,\" and \"[[Alice Blue Gown]].\"\n\nAfter the film had been completed, [[music supervisor]] Joel C. High realised the version of \"Charleston\" heard in the birthday party scene was a jazz-tinged arrangement from the 1950s and had Ian Whitcomb & His Bungalow Boys record an authentic 1920s rendition to replace it. Bogdanovich preferred the livelier, more contemporary sound of the 1950s version but finally was convinced by High to use the more accurate recording.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film premiered at the [[Locarno Film Festival]] in August 2001.
