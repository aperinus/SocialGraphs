It was later broadcast on [[NBC]] on February 26, 2009 and is now available as a separate DVD as of March 24, 2009.\n\nThe film has a [[framing story]] of Po the Dragon Warrior (in [[computer animation]]) telling the stories of his comrades in arms, the Furious Five, which are depicted in 2D [[cel animation]], similar to the opening and end credits of the original film.\n\nThe only actors from the film to reprise their roles in this short were [[Jack Black]] as Po, [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Master Shifu, [[David Cross]] as Crane, and [[Randall Duk Kim]] as Master Oogway. [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Seth Rogen]] do not reprise their roles mainly because their related characters are depicted as their younger selves.\n\nIn this short, Monkey is voiced by [[Jaycee Chan]], son of [[Jackie Chan]]. Jaycee Chan also voiced Crane in the [[Cantonese]] version of the original film. Production of the film was outsourced to [[Reel FX Creative Studios]], who worked on CG animation, and to [[Film Roman]], who worked on traditionally animated sequences.<ref>{{cite web | last=Simon | first=Ben | url=http://animatedviews.com/2008/kung-fu-panda-with-secrets-of-the-furious-five-bonus/ | title=Kung Fu Panda / Secrets Of The Furious Five | publisher=Animated Views | date=2008-11-30 | access-date=2010-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===Introduction===\nMaster [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] instructs [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]] to teach an introductory [[Chinese martial arts|Kung Fu]] lesson to a group of rambunctious bunny children. Po tries to teach the kids that combat is only part of what [[Kung fu (term)|Kung Fu]] is about, as its true meaning is \"excellence of self.\" To illustrate his point, he explains the [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#The Furious Five|Furious Five]]'s individual backstories, and the basic philosophical concepts that enabled them to be great Kung Fu masters.\n\n===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Mantis|Mantis]]===\n'''Mantis''', as a youth, was a petulantly impatient warrior, prone to jumping to conclusions and making impulsive decisions. Eventually, this habit got him captured by Crocodile bandits. The long wait Mantis was forced to endure in his prison taught him ''[[patience]]'', and he was able to use this to play dead long enough to ambush his captors.\n\n===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Viper|Viper]]===\n'''Viper''', the daughter of [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Great Master Viper|Great Master Viper]], was born without venomous fangs. Her father, who relied on his venomous bite to protect the village, believed she could never be a warrior like him, causing Viper to grow up shy and timid. One night during a festival, Great Master Viper encountered a gorilla bandit, and broke his fangs on the gorilla's special snake-proof armor. Seeing her father in peril, Viper found the ''[[courage]]'' to fight the bandit and defeat him with her [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|ribbon dancing]] skills.\n\n===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Crane|Crane]]===\n'''Crane''' was the self-deprecating janitor of a Kung Fu academy, until the star pupil [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Mei Ling|Mei Ling]] encouraged him to seek enrollment. Crane's lifelong belief that he was too skinny to be an effective Kung Fu warrior caused him to lose his nerve at the tryouts; however, when he accidentally stumbled into the intense obstacle course to determine eligibility, he discovered the ''[[confidence]]'' to use his skinniness as an asset and pass the test.\n\n===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Tigress|Tigress]]===\n'''Tigress''' was an orphan, and unfairly isolated as a 'monster' because of her lack of control over her ferocity and strength. At the behest of the orphanage staff, Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] arrived to teach her the ''[[discipline]]'' she desperately needed to control her movements. Eventually, the other children trusted and even befriended her. Despite this breakthrough, no adult would consent to adopt her, so Master Shifu took her in as his student and foster daughter.\n\n===[[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Monkey|Monkey]]===\n'''Monkey''' was humiliated in his youth, and grew up tormenting his village with pranks as revenge. Many challengers attempted to drive him away, but Monkey would always remove their pants to humiliate them. Master Oogway, who had a shell instead of pants, was able to subdue Monkey, and saved Monkey from being crushed by a column knocked loose in their brawl. Noticing Monkey's reaction to being cared about, Oogway told Monkey he could stay in the village as long as he would show others the ''[[compassion]]'' he so greatly desired himself.\n\n===Conclusion===\nMaster Shifu returns, anticipating to find a lack of progress, and is surprised to see he has underestimated Po's talents yet again. When the Bunnies ask Po how his first day of Kung Fu was, Po has a flashback to all the unpleasant events of [[Kung Fu Panda (film)|the first film]]. He then smiles and confidently assures them that \"it was awesome!\"\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jack Black]] as [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]]\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]]\n* [[David Cross]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Crane|Crane]]\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Grand Master Oogway|Oogway]]\n* [[Elizabeth Ann Bennett]] as Ant / Bunny\n* [[Jaycee Chan]] as Young [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Monkey|Monkey]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Instructor\n* [[Jessica DiCicco]] as Young [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Viper|Viper]]\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Crocodile Bandit #1 / Gorilla Bandit\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Sheep\n* Stephanie Kearin as Crocodile Bandit #2\n* Max Koch as Young [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Mantis|Mantis]]\n* [[Stephanie Lemelin]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Mei Ling|Mei Ling]]\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Master Viper's Mom\n* Tom Owens as Ladybug\n* Eamon Pirruccello as Impatient Bunny\n* Grace Rolek as Shy Bunny\n* Will Shadley as Nerdy Bunny\n* [[James Sie]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Great Master Viper|Great Master Viper]]\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Young [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Tigress|Tigress]]\nNote: Mr Ping didn't appear in the short, only on the DVD cover of the film.\n\n==Awards==\n''Secrets of the Furious Five'' has received eight nominations in the \"Animated Television Production or Short Form\" category at the [[36th Annie Awards]], of which it received four (\"Character Animation,\" \"Character Design,\" \"Music,\" and \"Production Design\").\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Furious Five}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.kungfupanda.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|1287845}}\n\n{{Kung Fu Panda}}\n{{DreamWorks animated films}}\n{{Film Roman}}\n{{Raman Hui}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secrets Of The Furious Five}}\n[[Category:Kung Fu Panda films]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s animated short films]]\n[[Category:2008 action comedy films]]\n[[Category:American animated short films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:2008 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Animation animated short films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Henry Jackman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Powell]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Raman Hui]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures animated films]]\n[[Category:Reel FX Creative Studios short films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Todd Berger]]\n[[Category:Wuxia films]]\n[[Category:Film Roman films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
