The film stars [[Anna Paquin]], [[Jeff Daniels]], and [[Dana Delany]]. ''Fly Away Home'' was released on September 13, 1996, by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n''Fly Away Home'' dramatizes the actual experiences of [[Bill Lishman]] who, in 1986, started training [[Canada geese]] to follow his ultralight aircraft, and succeeded in leading their migration in 1993 through his program \"Operation Migration\". The film is also based on the experience of Dr. [[William J. L. Sladen]], a British-born zoologist and adventurer, who aided Lishman with the migration.<ref name=wpost>{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Langer |title=William J.L.

Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father's old barn to [[Avian incubation|incubate]]. When the eggs hatch, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local Animal Regulation officer Glen Seifert on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that a private ordinance dictates that all [[domesticated animals|domestic]] geese must have their wings [[pinioning|pinioned]] (clipped) to render them flightless. He promptly tries to demonstrate the process with one of the goslings, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.\n\nThomas decides to use an [[ultralight]] aircraft he had been constructing to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry, Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own. David knows someone running a [[bird sanctuary]] in [[North Carolina]], and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.\n\nAmy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy's aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, the Aldens free the geese, and Amy leads them on their migration to North Carolina.\n\nMaking an emergency landing at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]] in western New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on.\n\nThomas and Amy meet an old woman with a vendetta against goose shooting, and she invites them to stay the night at her house. That night Amy asks Thomas why he seldom visited her and her mother. From her mother, she knows that her parents were artists, who tend to be selfish, and that her mother left for both of their sakes. Thomas tells her that he was afraid and angry at himself for letting them leave, so he spent the next ten years buried in his work. He apologizes to Amy.\n\nThirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas's aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; having suffered a dislocated shoulder he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry, and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.\n\nAmy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy's family, and to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. During the end credits, a note reveals that all 16 geese - including Igor - return to the Aldens' farm on their own in the following spring.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Thomas Alden\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Amy Alden\n* [[Dana Delany]] as Susan Barnes\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as David Alden\n* [[Holter Graham]] as Barry Stickland\n* [[Jeremy Ratchford]] as Glen Seifert\n* Deborah Verginella as Aliane Alden\n* [[Michael J.

The Easy Riser first appears as a foot-launched biplane hang glider. True to Lishman's real-life saga, modifications were made to improve the design including the addition of a motor and seat. Anna Paquin's character instead flies an A-frame Cosmos Trike with a mock goose head mounted to the noseplate of the airframe and a fabric wing covering painted to resemble feathers. The Cosmos Trike was reportedly chosen for its safety, superior engine power, and increased wing size (a feature that was needed to fly slow enough for the birds).<ref name=\"lishman\">[http://williamlishman.com/flight.htm \"Ultralight Aircraft.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212231700/http://www.williamlishman.com/flight.htm |date=2009-12-12 }} ''williamlishman.com''.
