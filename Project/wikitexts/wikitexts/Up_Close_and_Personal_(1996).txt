The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter [[John Gregory Dunne]], having spent eight years working on the script with his wife [[Joan Didion]], later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]''.\n\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Celine Dion]].\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring news anchor Sally \"Tally\" Atwater makes a demo tape of a fake story and is hired by [[Miami]] station manager Warren Justice. Though she lacks polish and experience, Warren sees promise in Tally and decides to give her a chance, giving her tough love assignments to foster her talent. After a well-done news story about two immigrants who drowned off the shores of [[Miami Beach]], Tally and Warren form an even closer mentor/mentee friendship built upon mutual respect and simmering attraction. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Tally covers the first locally-born baby of the year, a child by convicted felon Fernando Buttanda. A heated exchange occurs on air between Tally and the lead male anchor. She confronts the station's perception that she is merely in her position because she is Warren\u2019s \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u201d and threatens to quit.\n\nTally tracks down and meets with talent agent Bucky Terranova, who takes her on as a client and lands her a position as a reporter in [[Philadelphia]], a much larger market. Due to her impending departure, Tally decides to confront her feelings for Warren. The two end up physically consummating their emotional relationship, including a getaway to the [[Florida Keys]] before Tally\u2019s move to Philadelphia.\n\nTally struggles at her new post - largely due to hostile veteran reporter Marcia McGrath, who jealously protects her position as top reporter - and starts to lose some of the charisma that initially captured Bucky\u2019s attention. At Bucky's request, and out of affection for Tally, Warren visits her in Philadelphia and talks her through missteps she has taken by trying to emulate Marcia instead of being herself. Encouraged by Warren, Tally begins to perform to her previous standards, leading Marcia to accept an offer from a station in [[Cincinnati]], thus handing the position to Tally. Tally asks Warren to marry her and relocate to Philadelphia so that they can be together. On their honeymoon they come up with a story idea that looks at a \u201cday in the life\u201d of Fernando, who has been relocated to a Philadelphia prison. During this time, Warren\u2019s backstory is revealed as he attempts to find a job in order to remain close to Tally.\n\nWhile filming the segment at the prison, a [[prison riot]] occurs wherein Tally and her cameraman Ned Jackson are taken hostage. Tally covers the volatile and groundbreaking story from within the prison walls as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. As the story uncovers, she fulfills the potential that Warren initially saw in her. Her poise and bravery leads to an evening anchor position with the nationally-broadcast IBS News. While relaying the job offer to Warren, she discovers that he senses a developing story in Panama that he intends to cover. Warren tells Tally that she inspired him to want more, including possibly returning to journalism. Sadly, during Tally\u2019s going away party at the Philadelphia station, it is reported that Warren and his crew were fired upon after wrapping up their story, resulting in Warren's death.\n\nThe movie ends with Tally discussing the purpose of journalism. In a touching tribute, she notes that Warren had a hunch, followed it, and ultimately got the story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Warren Justice\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Sally \"Tally\" Atwater\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Marcia McGrath\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Bucky Terranova\n* [[Kate Nelligan]] as Joanna Kennelly\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Ned Jackson\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as John Merino\n* [[Scott Bryce]] as Rob Sullivan\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Fernando Buttanda\n* [[Dedee Pfeiffer]] as Luanne Atwater\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Dan Duarte\n* [[Noble Willingham]] as Buford Sells\n* [[James Karen]] as Tom Orr\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Vic Nash\n* [[Fabian Forte]] as Himself\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nIn the spring of 1988, [[John Gregory Dunne]] and [[Joan Didion]] began writing the script for a film entitled ''Golden Girl'', based on [[Alanna Nash]]'s biography of the late [[NBC News]] anchor and reporter [[Jessica Savitch]] and financed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. When the film was finally released in 1996, eight years later, it was known as ''Up Close & Personal'' and none of the more controversial details of Savitch's life remained, including her alleged drug abuse problems that may have caused her to deliver an incoherent live news update on national television in early October 1983.<ref name=\"haller\">{{cite magazine |last=Haller |first=Scot |date=1983-11-07 |title=The Two Faces of a Newswoman |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |url-status=dead |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |page=48 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114072316/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |archive-date=2008-11-14 |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> Other details omitted from the film included the suicide of Savitch's second husband a few months after their wedding, and her alleged bisexuality, suicide attempts and [[domestic violence|physical abuse]] by her longtime partner [[Ron Kershaw]], a well-known news director who was the original model for the character of Warren Justice.<ref name=muddle>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |first=Larry |last=Gelbart |title=A Beginning, a Muddle and an End |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1997-03-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203090325/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |archive-date=2002-02-03 |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=meers>{{cite magazine |last=Meers |first=Erik Ashok |date=1996-04-16 |title=Jessica Savaged: How Hollywood Heterosexualized ''Up Close & Personal'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45 |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |publisher=Liberation Publications Inc.  |pages=45\u201347 |access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> Savitch's death at age 36 in an automobile accident (unrelated to drugs or alcohol) was also left out of the screenplay.<ref name=haller />\n\nAccording to Dunne, who chronicled his experiences dealing with studio executives in his book ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]'', the majority of these changes were made in order to appeal to a broader mainstream market.
