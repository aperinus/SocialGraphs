Much of it is based on the family and parenting experiences of Howard, Ganz, Mandel, and producer [[Brian Grazer]], who have at least 17 children among the four of them. [[Principal photography]] was filmed in and around [[Orlando, Florida]] with some scenes filmed at the [[University of Florida]]. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: Dianne Wiest for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Randy Newman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Song]] for \"I Love to See You Smile\".\n\nThe film was adapted into an [[NBC]] television series in [[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|1990]] and [[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|2010]]. While the first series was canceled after one season, the second series ran for six seasons.\n\n==Plot==\nGil Buckman, a [[St. Louis]] sales executive, is trying to balance his family and his career. When he finds out that his eldest son, Kevin, has emotional problems and needs therapy and that his two younger children, Taylor and Justin, both have issues as well, he begins to blame himself and questions his abilities as a father. When his wife, Karen, becomes pregnant with their fourth child he is unsure he can handle it.\n\nGil is also frustrated and fearful that the financial burdens of another child and office politics at work are turning him into the detached workaholic he despised in his own father, Frank. Humbled by family and work issues, Gil opens up to Frank about his doubts as a parent. Frank tells him that he worries too much, and they have a reconciliation of sorts with Frank telling Gil that worry for one's children never ends. Gil is finally able to accept the life he has chosen after his elderly grandmother tells him the story of her first experience riding a roller coaster when she was young and was amazed at all of the different emotions she experienced compared to the merry-go-round which was simple and bland.\n\nGil's older sister, Helen, is a divorced bank manager whose wealthy dentist ex-husband wants nothing to do with their kids, Garry and Julie, aside from small [[child support]] payments, and spends more time with his own second family. Garry, who has just entered puberty, is quiet and withdrawn and likes to be alone in his room with a mysterious paper bag. At first, Helen worries that it contains drugs or alcohol, but later finds it actually contains pornography.\n\nJulie is still in high school but is not interested in her education. She and her boyfriend, Tod Higgins, get married, she becomes pregnant, and Tod moves into Helen's house. Helen asks Tod to talk with Garry believing he would be more comfortable confiding to another male. Tod reassures Garry that his obsession with girls and sex is normal for a boy his age, to Garry's relief. This also increases Helen's respect for Tod, especially when Tod reveals his own past involving his abusive father and his determination not to follow the same path. Eventually, she supports Tod and Julie's relationship to the extent that when Julie wants to break up with Tod, Helen orders her to face her fears and work on their relationship. Helen also starts dating Garry's science teacher, giving Garry a father figure he has long been without.\n\nGil and Helen's younger sister, Susan, is a middle school teacher married to scientist and researcher Nathan Huffner. They have a precocious daughter, Patty. Susan wants more children, but Nathan is more interested in Patty's cognitive development. Susan lashes out by eating junk food and compromises her diaphragm as a plan to get pregnant against Nathan's wishes. She eventually gets so frustrated that she leaves Nathan, who eventually comes to one of her classes and serenades her to win her back promising her he will try to change. She agrees to move back home.\n\nThe youngest, Larry, is the black sheep of the family but is Frank's favorite. Rather than settle into a career, he has drifted through life trying to cash in on get-rich-quick schemes. He has recently shown up along with his biracial son, Cool (the result of a brief affair with a Las Vegas showgirl), asking to borrow money from Frank. It soon becomes apparent that he needs it to pay off gambling debts ($26,000 worth) or he will be killed. Frank is disillusioned but still loves him and tries to help. Frank refuses to bail him out completely but offers to teach him the family business so he can take over for Frank who has to put off retirement to pay off the debt. However, Larry instead suggests another get-rich-quick scheme which involves him going to [[Chile]]. Frank agrees to look after Cool knowing that Larry will most likely never return, and the fact that Larry will not take care of Cool.\n\nThe family is reunited at the hospital when Helen gives birth to a daughter. Frank holds Cool who is shown to have been fully embraces by the family, and thriving. Tod and Julie are together, raising their son. Susan is visibly pregnant. Gil and Karen are now the parents of four.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Gilbert \"Gil\" Buckman\n**[[Max Elliott Slade]] as Young Gilbert \"Gil\" Buckman\n* Richard Kuhlman as Younger Francis \"Frank\" Buckman\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Helen Buckman\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Karen Buckman\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Francis \"Frank\" Buckman\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Nathan Huffner\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Lawrence \"Larry\" Buckman\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Julia \"Julie\" Buckman-Higgins\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Tod Higgins\n* [[Harley Jane Kozak]] as Susan Huffner (nee Buckman)\n* [[Eileen Ryan]] as Marilyn Buckman\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Gareth \"Garry\" Buckman-Lampkin\n* [[Helen Shaw (actress)|Helen Shaw]] as Grandma\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Kevin Buckman\n* [[Paul Linke]] as George Bowman\n* [[Alisan Porter]] as Taylor Buckman\n* [[Ivyann Schwann]] as Patricia \"Patty\" Huffner\n* Zachary La Voy as Justin Buckman\n* Alex Burrall as Cool Buckman\n* [[Charmin Lee]] as Nurse at Hospital\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] as David Brodsky\n}}\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at {{No.|1}} in its opening weekend, earning $10{{nbsp}}million.
