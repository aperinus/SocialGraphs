The film, which has elements of bleak [[black comedy]] and [[film noir]], is a [[courtroom drama]] set in the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]] and is based on the 1953 [[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Agatha Christie]]. The first film adaptation of Christie's story, ''Witness for the Prosecution'' was adapted for the screen by Larry Marcus, [[Harry Kurnitz]] and Wilder. The film received positive reviews and six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.\n\n==Plot==\nSenior [[barrister]] Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who is recovering from a heart attack, agrees to defend Leonard Vole despite the objections of his private nurse Miss Plimsoll, as Sir Wilfrid's doctor has warned him against taking any criminal cases. Vole is accused of murdering Emily French, a wealthy, childless, older widow who had become enamored of him and had named him as the main beneficiary in her will. Strong [[circumstantial evidence]] points to Vole as the killer, but Sir Wilfrid believes Vole to be innocent.\n\nWhen Sir Wilfrid speaks with Vole's German wife Christine, he finds her rather cold and self-possessed, but she does provide an alibi, although it is not entirely convincing. He is greatly surprised when, during the trial, she is summoned as a witness by the prosecuting barrister.\n\nWhile a wife cannot be [[Spousal privilege|compelled to testify against her husband]], Christine was still married to Otto Helm, a German man now living in East Germany in the [[Soviet occupation zone of Germany|Russian Zone]], when she wed Vole (who was in the [[Royal Air Force]] and part of the [[World War II|occupation forces in Germany]] and had married her to help her escape Germany). She testifies that Vole privately confessed to her that he had killed Mrs. French, and her conscience forced her to finally tell the truth.\n\nDuring the trial in the [[Old Bailey]], Sir Wilfrid is contacted by a mysterious woman who, for a fee, provides him with letters written by Christine to a mysterious lover named Max. The handwriting is genuine, and the woman has a legitimate reason for providing the letters: her face has been scarred and slashed, supposedly by Max. The letters include an account of Max and Christine's plan to kill Leonard, which convinces the jury that Christine had deliberately perjured herself. Leonard is acquitted, much to the crowd's delight.\n\nHowever, Sir Wilfrid is troubled by the verdict. He is proved correct when Christine, brought into the courtroom for safety after being assailed by the departing crowd for her conduct, tells him that he had help winning the case. Sir Wilfrid had told her before the trial that any alibi contributed by a loving wife would be believed by the jury. So she played a hateful, double-crossing wife and proffered testimony implicating her husband, and then forged the letters to the non-existent Max and assumed a disguise to play the mysterious woman who contributed the letters, discrediting her own testimony and leading to the acquittal. She admits that she saved Leonard, although she knew that he was guilty, because she loves him. She accepts that she may be tried for perjury.\n\nLeonard, who has overheard Christine's admission, cheerfully confirms that he indeed killed Mrs. French. Sir Wilfrid is infuriated but helpless to stop Leonard because of [[double jeopardy|double-jeopardy]] laws ([[Double jeopardy#Post-2003|since overturned]] in the United Kingdom) that would prevent a retrial. Christine is shocked to discover that Leonard has been in an affair with a younger woman for whom he plans to abandon Christine, feeling he and Christine are now even because they have saved each other's lives.\n\nChristine angrily grabs a knife (used earlier as evidence and subtly highlighted by a reflection on Sir Wilfrid's monocle) and kills Leonard. After she is arrested by the police, Sir Wilfrid, urged on by Miss Plimsoll, declares that he will take on Christine's defense.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Credited===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tyrone Power]] as Leonard Vole, the accused \n* [[Marlene Dietrich]] as Christine Vole/Helm, the accused's wife\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as Sir Wilfrid Robarts [[Queen's Counsel|Q.C.]], senior counsel for Vole\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Miss Plimsoll, Sir Wilfrid's private nurse \n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as Mr. Brogan-Moore, Sir Wilfrid's junior counsel in the trial\n* [[Henry Daniell]] as Mr. Mayhew, Vole's [[solicitor]] who instructs Sir Wilfrid on the case\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as H.
