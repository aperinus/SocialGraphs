It stars [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Ben Chaplin]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. The story is a modern reinterpretation of the 1897 ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' story and follows Abby, a veterinarian and radio talk show host who asks her model friend Noelle to impersonate her when a handsome guy shows interest in her. The original music score was composed by [[Howard Shore]]. Upon its release, the film garnered positive reviews and was met with considerable box office success.\n\n==Plot==\n\nAbby Barnes is a [[veterinarian]] and host of a radio show called ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs''. Photographer Brian calls into her show for advice, and unexpectedly sends her a gift and calls her at work to ask her out; she agrees to meet. Her insecurity about her appearance leads her to lie to him over the phone and describe herself with the physical features of her neighbor Noelle. She stands him up. After intervening in an argument between Noelle and her abusive boyfriend Roy, the two women become friends. Brian shows up unexpectedly at Abby's work at the same time as Noelle, and Abby convinces her to pretend she is Abby.\n\nAbby adopts the persona of Donna, friend to Noelle (posing as Abby) and the two begin spending time with Brian together. They invent a story that Abby uses a different voice on the radio than in real life. He is physically attracted to Noelle, but notices that \"Abby\" has a distinctly different (and decidedly less intellectual) personality in person than on the radio and phone. When he calls the real Abby to ask her out again, he asks her to use her \"radio voice\" and the two spend nearly seven hours on the phone getting to know one another.\n\nThe two women decide to tell Brian the truth by way of Noelle showing up at his home while Abby is live on the radio, but when Noelle arrives, she is entranced by the many kind things he says about her personality and intelligence (even though he is actually talking about Abby). She fails to tell him the truth, which nearly causes a rift between the women, but ultimately Noelle realizes that flattery about someone else may feel good in the moment but isn't authentic. She takes a two-week modeling gig out of town in order to put space between herself and Brian.\n\nNoelle returns and tells Brian to make a list of the things he loves about Abby, and to meet at Abby's apartment that night. He does, and reads the list to \"Donna\". The first few things on the list are about Noelle's appearance, but then the list evolves into more important things about Abby that Brian has truly fallen in love with. He professes his love through the bathroom door thinking \"Abby\" is bathing inside, but gets no response. He then notices flyers for a charity event Abby is attending, complete with her photo, and realizes the truth.\n\nAbby later approaches Brian at his bar, apologizing for her deceit and explains what really happened. Although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby again and admits he has fallen for her and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception. He suggests they start again, and Abby happily agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Noelle Slusarsky\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Abby Barnes\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Brian\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Ed\n* [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]] as Roy\n* Richard Coca as Eric\n* [[Stanley DeSantis]] as Mario\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Bookstore Man\n* [[David Cross]] as Male Radio Caller\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Female Radio Caller\n}}\n\n== Themes==\nScreenwriter Audrey Wells said she was inspired by the 1897 play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' by [[Edmond Rostand]] and wanted to modernize it by [[Gender flip|flipping the genders]] of the original characters.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 26, 1996 |title=A shaggy dog romance |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nP5TAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA20 |access-date=April 26, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Guthmann |first=Edward |date=September 13, 1996 |title=Garofalo's a Find in ''Cats & Dogs'' |page=D18 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-REVIEW-Garofalo-s-a-Find-in-Cats-Dogs-2967000.php |access-date=April 26, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=April 26, 1996 |title=The Truth About Cats & Dogs |page= |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |location= |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-truth-about-cats-and-dogs-1996 |access-date=April 26, 2022}}</ref> In this version, Abby is the talented but \"ugly\" Cyrano, Noelle is Christian, and Brian is Roxane.\n\nCommenting on the ugly-versus-beautiful theme, Uma Thurman said, \"We probably keep going back to that idea because there's a whole industry that needs to sell a lot of products that wants us to think that the outside is the important part.
