It stars [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Elvis Presley]]&mdash;now a resident in a nursing home. The film also stars [[Ossie Davis]] as Jack, a black man who claims to be [[John F. Kennedy]], explaining that he was patched up after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]], dyed black, and abandoned.\n\nIt is based on the [[Bubba Ho-Tep (novella)|novella of the same name]] by [[Joe R. Lansdale]], which originally appeared in the anthology ''The King Is Dead: Tales of Elvis Post-Mortem''. Originally the film was \"[[roadshow]]ed\" by the director across the country. Only 32 [[print (filmmaking)|prints]] were made and circulated around various film festivals, though these garnered critical success. By the time it was released on DVD, it had already achieved [[Cult film|cult status]] due to positive reviews, lack of access, and inclusion of (and similar on-the-road hard work by) Campbell.\n\nWhile the novella and film revolve around an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[mummy]] (played by [[Bob Ivy]]) terrorizing a [[retirement home]], ''Bubba Ho-tep'' also deals with the deeper theme of aging and growing old in a culture that only values the young. The film also features a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] by [[Reggie Bannister]] from Coscarelli's ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nAn elderly man at The Shady Rest Retirement Home in [[East Texas]] is known to the staff as Sebastian Haff, but claims to be the real [[Elvis Presley]]. He explains that during the 1970s, he grew tired of the demands of his fame and switched places with an [[Elvis impersonator]] named Sebastian Haff; he claims it was Haff who died in 1977, while he lived in quiet, happy anonymity and made a living pretending to be himself. After a propane explosion destroyed documentation which was the only proof that he was actually Elvis, he was unable to return to his old life. He also falls into a coma after injuring himself during a performance.\n\nTwenty years later in the present, Elvis contemplates his age and dignity; his only friend is a man named Jack who insists he is President [[John F. Kennedy]], claiming to have had his skin dyed black after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|an assassination attempt]] and abandoned by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] in a nursing home. Initially skeptical of Jack's story, Elvis does spot a mysterious scar on the back of Jack's head, but is ultimately unsure of its origin.\n\nEventually, Elvis and Jack are forced to face off against a re-animated [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[mummy]] that was stolen during a U.S. museum tour, and then lost during a severe storm in East Texas when the thieves' bus veered into a river near the nursing home. The mummy takes on the garb of a cowboy and feeds on the souls of the residents of the home. It is dubbed 'Bubba Ho-Tep' by Elvis, who has a [[telepathic]] flashback of the mummy's life and death when he looks into its eyes. Due to their age, Jack and Elvis lack mobility and use a [[Wheelchair#Power Chairs|motorized wheelchair]] and a [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] to get around the grounds.\n\nElvis and Jack create an elaborate plan to destroy the mummy. Destruction of the mummy would release the trapped souls of the other inhabitants, and they would be able to go to their final resting place. Elvis and Jack battle the mummy in the middle of the night, with Jack in an electric wheelchair and Elvis wielding a makeshift flamethrower. Jack is knocked out of his wheelchair by the mummy and is about to have his soul devoured; Elvis commandeers the wheelchair and crashes into the mummy to save Jack, but damages the flamethrower and suffers a large gash in his abdomen in the process. Meanwhile, Jack dies from a heart attack. Elvis becomes committed to getting rid of the mummy, and douses it with gasoline before throwing a match at it, incinerating the mummy.\n\nElvis lies on a hill near the river bank, dying from the blood loss from the gash and broken ribs. He contemplates that he does not fear death, knowing he still has his soul and saved everyone at the Shady Rest Retirement Home. As he reflects upon this, the stars align into a message for Elvis, saying: \"all is well\". Elvis says \"Thank you, thank you very much\", and dies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Elvis Presley]] / Sebastian Haff\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as [[John F. Kennedy|John F. \"Jack\" Kennedy]]\n* [[Ella Joyce]] as The Nurse\n* Heidi Marnhout as Callie Thomas\n* [[Bob Ivy]] as Bubba Ho-tep\n* [[Larry Pennell]] as Kemosabe\n* [[Reggie Bannister]] as Rest Home Administrator\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Hearse Driver\n\n==Production==\nMany of ''Bubba Ho-tep'''s crew also worked on the films in Coscarelli's ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' series. Several actors from the series also have small roles including Heidi Marnhout, Bob Ivy, and Reggie Bannister. Coscarelli kept much of the original short story's exposition, but had some difficulty trying to \"integrate Elvis' voice\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Quint on BUBBA HO-TEP + Interview with Coscarelli,

Elvis movie from the 1950s or 1960s, and would bring in [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Colonel Tom Parker]].\n\nIn 2007 Bruce Campbell reported that he was no longer involved in the sequel, as he and Coscarelli had \"a few points [developing the screenplay] that we couldn't reconcile\" and that he parted ways with the project as a way of keeping his friendship with the director.<ref

This story took place earlier in Elvis's life, during a period in which he worked for Colonel Parker battling monsters prior to exchanging identities with Sebastian Haff.\n\nIn 2018, [[IDW Publishing]] released a five-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] adaptation of the novella, retitled ''Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers''. The series was supervised by Lansdale, written by Joshua Jabcuga, and illustrated by Tadd Galusha.<ref>[https://www.idwpublishing.com/elvis-returns-in-bubba-ho-tep-and-the-cosmic-blood-suckers/ Elvis Returns in Bubba Ho-Tep and the Cosmic Blood-Suckers]</ref> In 2019, [[Dynamite Entertainment]] published a four-issue crossover miniseries, ''[[Army of Darkness (comics)#Army of Darkness/Bubba Ho-Tep|Army of Darkness/Bubba Ho-Tep]]'', which followed up the original story and saw Elvis team up with [[Ash Williams]], another character portrayed by Bruce Campbell.<ref>[https://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513027684101011 ARMY OF DARKNESS/BUBBA HO-TEP #1]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bubbahotep.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0281686}}\n* {{Amg movie|266235}}\n* {{mojo title|bubbahotep}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|bubba_hotep}}\n\n{{Don Coscarelli}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bubba Ho-Tep}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2002 independent films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:Ancient Egypt in fiction]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Elvis Presley]]\n[[Category:Films about Elvis Presley]]\n[[Category:Films about John F.
