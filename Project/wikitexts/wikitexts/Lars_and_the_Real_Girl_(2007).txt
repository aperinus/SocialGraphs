It stars [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]], [[Kelli Garner]], and [[Patricia Clarkson]]. The film follows Lars (Gosling), a kind-hearted but socially awkward young man who develops a romantic yet nonsexual relationship with an [[anatomically correct doll|anatomically correct]] [[sex doll]], a \"[[RealDoll]]\" named Bianca.\n\nThough a commercial failure, ''Lars and the Real Girl'' was critically acclaimed, receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], while Gosling received nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nLars Lindstrom lives a secluded life in a small [[Wisconsin]] town. His mother died when he was born, causing his grief-stricken father to have been a distant parent to Lars and his older brother, Gus. Gus left town as soon as he could support himself, returning only to inherit his half of the household when their father died. As an awkward adult, Lars feels guilt that his birth coincides with his mother's death and he seeks to resolve these conflicting feeling of love and loss.\n\nThe inheritance has been divided between the brothers: Lars lives in the converted garage, while Gus and his pregnant wife Karin live in the house proper. Lars is pathologically shy; interacting with or relating to his family or co-workers is very difficult for him. A colleague at his office job, Margo, likes him, but Lars is impervious to Margo\u2019s attempts to be friendly.\n\nOne evening, Lars happily announces to Gus and Karin that he has a visitor whom he met online, a [[wheelchair]]-mobile [[missionary]] of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] and [[Danes|Danish]] descent named Bianca. The pair are startled to discover that Bianca is actually a lifelike doll that Lars ordered from an adult website. Lars treats the doll as a live human being, asking if Bianca can stay in Gus and Karin's guest room, as she and Lars are religious and do not want scandal about their relationship. Gus and Karin play along with Lars\u2019 delusion, but, concerned about his mental health, also convince Lars to take Bianca with him to Dagmar, a [[family doctor]] who is also a [[psychologist]]. While Dagmar diagnoses Bianca with [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], she urges Lars to come in with Bianca for weekly treatments, during which Dagmar will attempt to analyze Lars and get to the root of his behavior. Dagmar explains to Gus and Karin that Lars\u2019 delusion is a manifestation of an underlying problem that needs to be addressed, and that they need to assist with Lars' therapy by continuing to treat Bianca as if she was real. During this time, Margo has begun to date another co-worker, which silently bothers Lars.\n\nEventually, Lars introduces Bianca as his girlfriend to his co-workers and various townspeople. Sympathetic to Lars, the town inhabitants react to the doll as if she were real, and Bianca soon finds herself involved in volunteer programs, getting a makeover from the local beautician, and working part-time as a model in a clothing store. Due to the town\u2019s acceptance of Bianca, Lars finds himself interacting more with people. When Margo reveals to Lars she has broken up with her boyfriend, Lars agrees to go bowling with her while Bianca attends a school board meeting. The two spend a pleasant evening, though Lars is quick to remind Margo he could never cheat on Bianca. She replies she would never expect that of him and tells him she hopes one day to find a man as faithful as him.\n\nLars also asks Gus when he knew he had become a man and what being a man means. Gus says he knew it when he began doing the right things for the right reasons, even when it hurt. Gus gives several examples, including their father keeping them and taking care of them, even though he didn't know how. Gus says that he never should have left Lars alone with their father, and he apologizes for being selfish. Their conversation seems to reach Lars and his dependence on Bianca begins to shift.\n\nOne morning, Lars discovers Bianca is unresponsive, and she's rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Her [[prognosis]] isn't good, and Lars announces Bianca would like to be brought home. News of her illness spreads through town, and everyone whose life has been touched by Bianca brings flowers or food to the Lindstrom home. Gus and Karin suggest Lars and Bianca join them for a visit to the lake. When Gus and Karin make their way back from the hike, they discover a despondent Lars in the lake with a \u201cdying\u201d Bianca, after Lars gave her a farewell kiss. The relationship was never sexual, and was Lars' way to let go of his guilt for his mother's (loved one's) death.\n\nBianca is given a full-fledged funeral that is well-attended by the townspeople. After Bianca is buried, Lars and Margo linger at the gravesite. Having come to terms with past traumas, ready to accept adult responsibilities, and filled with newfound self-confidence, Lars asks Margo if she would like to take a walk with him, which she happily accepts.\n\n== Mythical background ==\nThe film ''Lars and the Real Girl'' has very clear ties to Ovid\u2019s story of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]. Lars plays the modern version of Pygmalion in this romantic comedy adaptation.<ref name=thesis>{{cite web |url=https://repository.asu.edu/items/28694 |title=A Modern Myth of Perfection: The Pygmalion Story in Contemporary Film and Culture|date=May 2015|publisher=Barrett, The Honors College Thesis/Creative Project Collection |access-date=27 April 2021}}</ref> The story of Pygmalion is a story of unusual love as Pygmalion falls in love with his statue of a beautiful ivory woman. To Pygmalion, this statue is real, \u201cHe often felt the statue with his hands, to see if it was flesh, or ivory still, and then no longer admitted it was ivory\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ovid|title=Metamorphoses|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2017|translator-last=Simpson|translator-first=Michael}}</ref> Similarly, Lars sees Bianca as a real girl; he holds conversations with her, changes her clothes, puts her to sleep and washes her. Both Lars and Pygmalion find this false connection out of love and loneliness. For Lars, the love is romantic and fulfills a role in his life that was missing, while Pygmalion\u2019s is both romantic and sexual love. Lars and Pygmalion\u2019s stories come to a happy end when both realize what they want in life and put forth the work to accomplish this, though the difference is that Pygmalion's love actually makes the statue into a living woman, Galatea, while Lars must let Bianca \"die\" and move on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Lars Lindstrom\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Karin Lindstrom\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Gus Lindstrom\n* [[R.
