On top of all that, his longtime friend and mentor [[Gordon Freeman]] died tragically. Now he's depressed, and contemplating suicide. And yes, things get worse: a criminal named Avnet ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) has stolen three priceless coins, and decided to blackmail Bollingsworth ([[Tom Wilkinson]]), his billionaire partner in crime. After Kresk overhears this, he almost gets shot\u2014and Avnet ends up impaled on a pair of barbers' scissors.\n\nNow Kresk is in a considerably nastier situation, so he steals the gun and the coins. But things take a sharp turn when he hires a hit man named Mikey ([[Elijah Wood]]), and discovers that the hit man is only seventeen and emotionally traumatized by his parents' suicide. And that Kresk is falling for the cop/[[Playboy]] model Sgt. Meredith Kolko ([[Salma Hayek]]), and that his nephew Scottie (Devin Drewitz) has now swallowed the coins. Now Kresk is in over his head, and has to deal with the strange and sometimes dangerous people around him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Kresk\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Kolko\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Avnet\n* [[David Cross]] as Andy\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Mikey\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Bollingsworth\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Mr. Kerne\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Paulie\n* [[Orlando Jones]] as Miss Cocoa\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Karen\n* [[John Cassini]] as Henchman\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Hitman\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Melander Stevens\n* [[Myndy Crist]] as Jeannie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\nThe primary filming location was [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}\n\n==Release==\n''Chain of Fools'' was released in theatres on September 22, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/chain-fools|title=Chain of Fools|publisher=Warner Bros|access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as \"uneven but shows definite signs of promise.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/chain-of-fools-1200467419/|title=Chain of Fools|date=March 11, 2001|first=Gunnar|last=Rehlin|publisher=Variety|access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.chainoffools.com/|Chain of Fools}}\n* {{Amg movie|184305|Chain of Fools}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0194368|title=Chain of Fools}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|1138933_chain_of_fools}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Murphy (composer)]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
