Oscar is then enlisted to restore order in Oz while struggling to resolve conflicts with the witches and himself.\n\nKapner began developing an [[origin story]] for the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] after a lifelong interest in wanting to create one for the character. [[Walt Disney Pictures]] commissioned the film's production in 2009 with [[Joe Roth]] as producer and [[Grant Curtis]], [[Joshua Donen]], Philip Steuer and Palak Patel serving as executive producers. Raimi was hired to direct the following year. After [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Johnny Depp]] declined the titular role, Franco was cast in February 2011 with [[principal photography]] commencing five months later. [[Danny Elfman]] composed the film's score.\n\n''Oz the Great and Powerful'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on February 14, 2013, followed by a general theatrical release on March 8, 2013, in [[Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] formats.

The circus [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] learns Oscar has flirted with his wife and threatens him. Oscar escapes in a [[hot air balloon]] but is sucked into a [[tornado]] that takes him to the [[Land of Oz]]. There he encounters the na\u00efve witch Theodora, who believes him to be the wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by defeating the Wicked Witch, who killed the previous king. The idea of being a wealthy monarch makes Oscar accept the role. En route to the [[Emerald City]], Theodora falls in love with Oscar though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They encounter the [[flying monkey]], Finley, who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a [[Cowardly Lion|lion]]. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley and forces him to maintain the idea that he is the wizard.\n\nAt the Emerald City, Theodora's older sister Evanora tells Oscar that the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand. On the way to the forest, Oscar and Finley are joined by an [[orphan]]ed living [[china doll]] whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the forest and discover the \"Wicked Witch\" is the late king's daughter [[Glinda the Good Witch]], and Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her [[crystal ball]] and tricks Theodora into thinking Oscar is trying to court all three witches at once. She offers Theodora a magic apple \"to remove her heartache\", but it turns her into [[Wicked Witch of the West|a hideous green-skinned creature]].\n\nGlinda brings Oscar's group to her domain to escape Evanora's army of [[Winkie Country|Winkies]] and flying [[baboon]]s. She confides in Oscar that she knows he is not the wizard, but still believes he can help stop Evanora. He reluctantly takes charge of an \"army\" of [[Quadling]]s, Tinkers and [[Munchkin]]s. Theodora enters Glinda's domain and angrily reveals her new hideous appearance to Oscar before threatening to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory, but after telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero [[Thomas Edison]], he conceives a plan that relies on [[sleight of hand|trickery]].\n\nGlinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using a pulley-rig army of [[scarecrow]] puppets hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their flying baboons through a [[poppy]] field that puts them to sleep, but Glinda is captured in the process. Meanwhile, Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies but apparently abandons them in a hot air balloon loaded with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. As Evanora and Theodora prepare to kill Glinda, Oscar appears, having faked his betrayal and death. Using a hidden [[Fog machine|smoke machine]] and [[Projector|image projector]], he presents a [[Hologram|giant image of his face]] as his \"true\" form and a fireworks display to intimidate the Wicked Witches. Evanora fearfully hides in her castle while Theodora flees on her broom, unable to hurt the \"invincible\" wizard. Oscar offers to Theodora that she would be welcome to return if she overcomes her wickedness, but Theodora refuses and flies away to the West laughing maniacally, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda from her restraints with her wand, and she engages Evanora in a magical duel in the throne room. Glinda destroys Evanora's emerald necklace, revealing her true hag-like appearance, and banishes her from the Emerald City, while Evanora is carried away by a pair of flying baboons.\n\nOscar, now ruler of Oz, uses his projector to sustain the belief that he is a powerful wizard. He presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's [[Pocket knife|jackknife]] while Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald who was called \"Sourpuss\" by Oscar as a [[running gag]] throughout the movie, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship along with his top hat and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanks her for making him a better person, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = James Franco 4, 2013.jpg\n| width1 = 165\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Mila Kunis 2012.jpg\n| width2 = 178\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[James Franco]] ''(left)'' and [[Mila Kunis]] ''(right)'' were both praised for their performances as the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] and the [[Wicked Witch of the West]].\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs]], commonly known as Oz, a philandering [[confidence trick|con artist]], a [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] and a [[Wiktionary:barnstorm|barnstormer]]<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite journal |url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20679762,00.html |last= Nashawaty |first= Chris |title= Oz the Great and Powerful |journal= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |location= New York |publisher= Time Inc. |date= March 15, 2013 |page= 43 |access-date= March 16, 2013 |issue= 1250}}</ref> who is part of a traveling circus in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].

The iconic green look of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] is closer to her look in the 1939 film, as the Witch is a short, one-eyed crone in the novel. The Wicked Witches are portrayed as sisters, an idea which originated in the 1939 film. Also from the 1939 film is that several actors who play Oz characters make cameos in the Kansas segments, such as Frank, Oscar's assistant whom he refers to as his \"trained monkey\" (Frank's \"Oz\" counterpart is the winged monkey Finley) and a young disabled girl who serves as the Kansas counterpart to China Girl (in Kansas, Oscar is unable to make the wheelchair-using young girl walk, and gets a chance to do so when he repairs China Girl's broken legs); Annie who inspires Oscar to be a good and great person (Annie's \"Oz\" counterpart, Glinda, also inspires Oscar to be a better person) informs him that she has been [[Marriage proposal|proposed]] to by John Gale, presumably hinting at [[Dorothy Gale]]'s parental lineage.<ref name=\"dorothy\">{{cite news|last=Covert|first=Colin|title='Oz the Great and Powerful' is big and beautiful|url=http://www.salisburypost.com/article/20130310/SP03/130319982/1011|access-date=March 11, 2013|newspaper=Salisbury Post|date=March 10, 2013|quote=He makes a young, svelte, rather hot conjurer who has broken many a heart, including that of Dorothy Gale's mom-to-be (liquid-eyed Michelle Williams, resplendent in a blond wig).|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719210141/http://www.salisburypost.com/article/20130310/SP03/130319982/1011|archive-date=July 19, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Annie is seen wearing a [[gingham]] dress, a pattern famously associated with Dorothy.

Similarly, Glinda is referred to by her title in the novel (the Good Witch of the South), unlike the 1939 film, where her character's title is \"Good Witch of the North\" (due to her character being merged with the [[Good Witch of the North (Baum)|Good Witch of the North]]). Glinda is also the daughter of the late King of Oz, though in the novels, [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] is the King's daughter. Theodora's tears leave streak-like scars on her face, reflecting her weakness to water in the original story. Also, Oz is presented as a real place as it is in the novel, and not as a possible dream as the 1939 film implies.<ref>L.
