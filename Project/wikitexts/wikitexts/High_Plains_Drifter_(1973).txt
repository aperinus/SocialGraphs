The film stars Eastwood as a mysterious stranger who metes out justice in a corrupt [[American Old West|frontier]] mining town.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flynn |first=Erin E. |editor-last1=McClelland |editor-first1=Richard T. |editor-last2=Clayton |editor-first2=Brian B. |chapter=The Representation of Justice in Eastwood's ''High Plains Drifter'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp-VAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82 |title=The Philosophy of Clint Eastwood |date=2014 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-081314264-7 |access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood's two major collaborators, film directors [[Sergio Leone]] and [[Don Siegel]].<ref name=\"Kaminsky\">{{cite book |last=Kaminsky |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Kaminsky |title=Clint Eastwood |date=1975 |publisher=[[New American Library|Signet Books]] |isbn=978-0-451-06159-1}}</ref> In addition to Eastwood, the film also co-stars [[Verna Bloom]], [[Mariana Hill]], [[Mitchell Ryan]], [[Jack Ging]], and [[Stefan Gierasch]].\n\nThe film was shot on location on the shores of [[Mono Lake]], [[California]]. [[Dee Barton]] wrote the [[film score]]. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and remains popular.\n\n==Plot==\nA mysterious, unnamed stranger rides out of the desert, wearing a duster & black hat, into the isolated, lake mining town of Lago in the American [[Old West]]. Three hired \"town security\" gunmen taunt and threaten him; he kills all three with little effort. When the attractive, blond townswoman Callie Travers flirtatiously insults him, he rapes her in the [[livery stable]]. That night, in his hotel room, the Stranger dreams of Jim Duncan, a [[United States Marshals Service#19th century|federal marshal]], being whipped to death by [[Outlaw#Popular usage|outlaws]] Stacey Bridges and brothers Dan and Cole Carlin, as Lago's citizens watch in silence.\n\nThe next day, Lago officials offer the Stranger \"anything you want\" to protect the town from Bridges and the Carlins, who will soon be released from prison. It is gradually revealed that the townspeople hired these 'outlaws' to murder Duncan when he discovered the local gold mine was illegally on government land and would have to be closed, destroying the town's livelihood. The townspeople then turned in the outlaws on false robbery charges to avoid paying them, and they have vowed revenge.\n\nThe Stranger accepts the job and takes full advantage of the deal: he appoints a downtrodden [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] named Mordecai as both sheriff and mayor, provides a Native American and his children with blankets and candy when the shopkeeper refuses to serve them, gets a new saddle and boots, and forces the saloon to serve everyone free drinks. He later orders the hotel owners, Lewis and Sarah Belding, and all the other guests to vacate the premises, leaving him its sole occupant.\n\nCallie and several men including Morgan Allen conspire to kill the Stranger. After having sex with him in his room, she slips out as three men enter. As they unknowingly beat a dummy in the bed, the Stranger tosses a stick of dynamite into the room, destroying most of the hotel, then shoots two of his attackers dead, as Morgan flees wounded. The Stranger drags Sarah, kicking and screaming, into her bedroom (the only room in the hotel not damaged) where they have sex. The next morning, Sarah tells the Stranger that Duncan cannot rest in peace because the town buried him in an unmarked grave.\n\nThe Stranger assembles a group of citizens to defend the town, but soon realizes that none have the necessary \"shooting\" skills. He orders every building in town painted blood red. He then rides out of town without explanation, following the wounded Morgan. As he leaves, he paints over the town sign with a single word: \"Hell\".\n\nThe Stranger finds Bridges and the Carlins, who just \"finished off\" Morgan, and harasses them with dynamite and rifle fire, leading the outlaws to believe the townspeople are responsible. Returning to Lago, the Stranger inspects the preparations\u2014the entire town painted red, armed men on rooftops, picnic tables laden with food and drink, and a big \"WELCOME HOME BOYS\" banner\u2014then he silently departs again. The outlaws arrive and easily overcome the novice resistance of the townspeople; the defenders are all killed, while the survivors are rounded up in the saloon. The Stranger lures one of the Carlin brothers outside and whips him to death, then kills the remaining outlaws one at a time. Belding, aiming a shotgun at the Stranger's back, is shot dead by Mordecai.\nThe next morning as the Stranger rides past Mordecai in the cemetery. \"You know,\" Mordecai says, \"I never did know your name.\" The Stranger replies, \"Yes, you do.\"  As the Stranger rides off into the desert, a perplexed Mordecai stands beside the tombstone he just engraved \"Marshal Jim Duncan, Rest in Peace\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as The Stranger\n* [[Verna Bloom]] as Sarah Belding\n* [[Marianna Hill|Mariana Hill]] as Callie Travers\n* [[Billy Curtis]] as Mordecai\n* [[Mitch Ryan]] as (Mining executive) Dave Drake\n* [[Jack Ging]] as Morgan Allen\n* [[Stefan Gierasch]] as Mayor Jason Hobart\n* [[Ted Hartley]] as (Inn keeper) Lewis Belding\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Stacey Bridges\n* [[Dan Vadis]] as Dan Carlin\n* [[Anthony James (actor)|Anthony James]] as Cole Carlin\n* [[Walter Barnes (actor)|Walter Barnes]] as Sheriff Sam Shaw\n* [[Paul Brinegar]] as Lutie Naylor\n* [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]] as Asa Goodwin\n* [[Robert Donner]] as Preacher\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Bootmaker\n* [[John Quade]] as Freight Wagon Operator\n* [[Buddy Van Horn]] as Marshal Jim Duncan\n* [[William O'Connell (actor)|William O'Connell]] as the Barber\n* Reid Cruickshank as the gunsmith\n* James Gosa as Tommy Morris\n* Scott Walker as Billy Borders \n* [[Russ McCubbin]] as Fred Short\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Tuffa at Mono Lake with Sierra Nevada in background-1000px.jpeg|thumb|[[Mono Lake]] in California]]\nEastwood reportedly liked the offbeat quality of the film's original nine-page proposal and approached Universal with the idea of directing it. It is the first [[Western (genre)|Western]] film that he both directed and starred in. Under a joint production between Malpaso and Universal, the original screenplay was written by [[Ernest Tidyman]], who had won a Best Screenplay Oscar for ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''.<ref name=\"McGilligan221\">McGilligan (1999), p. 221</ref>\n\nTidyman's screenplay was inspired by the real-life [[murder of Kitty Genovese]] in [[Queens]] in 1964, which eyewitnesses reportedly stood by and watched. Holes in the plot were filled in with [[black humor]] and [[allegory]], influenced by [[Sergio Leone]].<ref name=\"McGilligan221\"/> An uncredited rewrite of the script was provided by [[Dean Riesner]], screenwriter of other Eastwood projects.\n\nUniversal wanted Eastwood to shoot the feature on its back lot, but Eastwood opted instead to film on location. After scouting locations alone in a pickup truck in [[Oregon]], [[Nevada]] and [[California]],<ref>Gentry, p. 63</ref> he settled on the \"highly photogenic\" [[Mono Lake]] area.<ref name=\"Hughes28\">Hughes, p. 28</ref> Over 50 technicians and construction workers built an entire town\u201414 houses, a church, and a two-story hotel\u2014in 18 days, using 150,000 feet of lumber.<ref name=\"Hughes28\"/>\n\nComplete buildings, rather than facades, were built, so that Eastwood could shoot interior scenes on the site. Additional scenes were filmed at [[Reno, Nevada]]'s [[Winnemucca Lake]] and California's [[Inyo National Forest]].<ref name=\"Hughes28\"/> The film was completed in six weeks, two days ahead of schedule, and under budget.<ref name=\"Eliot144\">Eliot (2009), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe character of Marshal Duncan was played by [[Buddy Van Horn]], Eastwood's long-time stunt double, to suggest that he and the Stranger could be the same person. In an interview, Eastwood said that earlier versions of the script made the Stranger the dead marshal's brother. He favored a less explicit and more supernatural interpretation, and excised the reference.<ref name=\"Hughes301\"/> The [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbings]] restored it.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/oct/07/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank Clint Eastwood]. Guardian interviews, retrieved August 8, 2016.</ref>\n\n\"It's just an allegory,\" Eastwood said, \"a speculation on what happens when they go ahead and kill the sheriff, and somebody comes back and calls the town's conscience to bear. There's always retribution for your deeds.\"<ref name=\"Hughes301\">Hughes, pp. 30\u201331</ref> The graveyard set featured in the film's final scene included tombstones inscribed \"[[Sergio Leone]]\" and \"[[Don Siegel]]\" as a humorous tribute to the two influential directors.<ref name=\"Kaminsky\" />\n\n==Reception==\nUniversal released the [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R-rated]] ''High Plains Drifter'' in the United States in April 1973, and the film eventually grossed $15.7 million domestically,<ref name=\"mojo\"/> ultimately making it the sixth-highest grossing Western in North America in the decade of the 1970s and the [[1973 in film|20th highest-grossing film released in 1973]].

Section 2, p. 3.</ref>\n\nArthur D. Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a nervously humorous, self-conscious near satire on the prototype Clint Eastwood formula of the avenging mysterious stranger.

''[[The Washington Post]]''. B9.</ref>\n\nThe film had its share of detractors. Some critics thought Eastwood's directing derivative; [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] in ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarked that Eastwood had \"absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society\".<ref name=\"McGilligan223\">McGilligan, p. 223</ref> [[Jon Landau]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' concurred, noting \"thematic shallowness\" and \"verbal archness\"; but he expressed approval of the dramatic scenery and cinematography.<ref name=\"McGilligan223\" />\n\n[[Nigel Andrews]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote that \"after ''[[Play Misty For Me]]'', ''High Plains Drifter'' emerges as a disappointingly sterile exercise in style, suggesting that the first thing Eastwood should do as a director is forget the lessons he has learned from other film-makers and start to forge a convincing style of his own.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |date=August 1973 |title=High Plains Drifter |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=40 |issue=475 |page=170 }}</ref> [[John Wayne]] criticized the film's iconoclastic approach; in a letter to Eastwood, he wrote, \"That isn't what the West was all about.
