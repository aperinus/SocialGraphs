The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Alan Silvestri]].  Although it opened to mixed reviews and was a [[box office disappointment|box-office disappointment]], ''Overboard'' has become a [[cult film]] and has been remade several times. In 1992, it was adapted in the [[Indian cinema|Indian film]] ''[[Ek Ladka Ek Ladki]]'', in 2006, it was adapted into the South Korean television series ''[[Couple or Trouble]]'', and in 2018 it was [[Overboard (2018 film)|remade]] with [[Anna Faris]] and [[Eugenio Derbez]]. The plot of the 1997 [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam film]] ''[[Mayaponman]]'' is loosely based on this film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nHeiress Joanna Stayton is accustomed to a wealthy life with her own yacht and fortune, along with her husband Grant Stayton III. While waiting for her yacht to be repaired in the fictional town of Elk Cove, Oregon, Joanna hires local carpenter Dean Proffitt, a widower with four sons, to remodel her closet. Dean produces quality work, which she dismisses because he used [[oak]] instead of [[cedar wood|cedar]], despite her not having requested this at the start.\n\nDean agrees to redo the closet if he is paid for the work he has already done, to no avail. The two have an argument, during which he berates her for her entitled attitude. This results in an angry Joanna throwing Dean and his tool kit into the water. That night, as the yacht sails away, Joanna goes on deck to retrieve a wedding ring, but loses her balance and falls overboard. She is later fished out of the water by a [[garbage scow]]. Now suffering from [[amnesia]], Joanna is taken to the local hospital. Grant learns of this and heads to pick Joanna up, but after seeing her mental state, he decides otherwise. Intending to have her fortune to himself, he returns to the yacht and has parties with younger women, lying that Joanna has decided to leave him.\n\nAfter seeing her story on the news, Dean seeks revenge by encouraging Joanna to [[debt bondage|work off her unpaid bill]]. He goes to the hospital and tells her that she is his wife Annie and the mother of his four sons. She reluctantly goes home with him and is appalled by his residence.\n\nJoanna initially has difficulty dealing with Dean's sons and the heavy load of chores, but she soon adapts. As she masters her responsibilities, she learns about the boys' school and family issues, and that Dean is secretly working two jobs to make ends meet. She falls in love with him and starts to care about his sons. She streamlines the money problems with more efficient budgeting and convinces Dean to be a more responsible father.\n\nJoanna makes Dean's dream come true by helping him design a [[miniature golf]] course. He also falls in love with her, but does not tell her about her real identity, fearing that she will leave. Four months later, Joanna's mother Edith learns what happened and threatens to have Grant hunted down. He is reluctantly forced to end the partying and return to Elk Cove to retrieve Joanna, whose memory is restored upon seeing him. Realizing that she was manipulated, a distraught Joanna returns with Grant to their yacht, which heads for [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nJoanna finds her old lifestyle boring and is uncomfortable with how rude Grant and Edith treat the boat staff. She apologizes to her butler Andrew and the crew for her spiteful treatment towards them, and soon realizes how happy she was with Dean and his sons, prompting her to turn the yacht back towards Elk Cove.\n\nThe next morning, Grant finds out that Joanna has changed course and becomes insane. While taking charge of the boat, he admits to purposely abandoning Joanna and having numerous affairs with other women in her absence.\n\nDean and the boys arrive on a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] boat to rescue Joanna, but are called away due to a sighting of salmon poachers. She is stunned the boat is turning around, thinking Dean changed his mind. He runs to the back of the boat and calls out to Joanna. He then jumps into the water to swim to her, and she does the same. An insane Grant furiously takes aim at Joanna with a [[bow and arrow]], only to be booted overboard by Andrew.\n\nDean initially believes Joanna gave up her rich life for him, but she tells him the money and the boat are hers. The two are then brought on board the Coast Guard boat, and they stand above his four sons who are making out their Christmas lists. Dean asks Joanna what he could possibly give her that she doesn't already have. She answers, \"A little girl\", and they kiss while the boat sails off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Joanna Stayton/Annie Proffitt\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Dean Proffitt, Annie's love interest\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Grant Stayton III, Joanna's husband\n* [[Katherine Helmond]] as Edith Mintz, Joanna's mother\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Andrew\n* [[Mike Hagerty|Michael G.
