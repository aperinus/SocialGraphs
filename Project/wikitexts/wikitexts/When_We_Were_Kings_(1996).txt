It features archival footage of celebrities, including [[James Brown]], [[B.B. King]], and promoter [[Don King]], in the lead-up to the fight and accompanying [[Zaire 74]] music festival, alongside interview footage of [[Norman Mailer]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Spike Lee]] and [[Thomas Hauser]] from the 1990s.\n\nThe film took Gast 22 years to edit and finance,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1997/02/21/when-we-were-kings|title=When We Were Kings|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> but it was finally released to strong reviews<ref name=\"rt\">[[Rotten Tomatoes]] page: \"[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/when_we_were_kings/ When We Were Kings]\"</ref> and won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] of 1996.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135880/When-We-Were-Kings/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127023531/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135880/When-We-Were-Kings/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-01-27 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2009 |title=NY Times: When We Were Kings |access-date=2008-11-21}}</ref>\n\n==Subject matter==\n[[Norman Mailer]], [[George Plimpton]], [[Spike Lee]], Malik Bowens, and [[Thomas Hauser]] were interviewed for the film in the 1990s. These interviews describe the historical importance of the fight, the questionable ethics of locating the fight in Zaire and accepting funding from the brutal [[dictator]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the fight itself, and, particularly, the interviewee's impressions of Ali. The interviews are accompanied by many news clips and photos to summarize Ali and Foreman's careers leading up to the Rumble.\n\nDuring the buildup to the fight, Ali is shown trash-talking Foreman  and talking about his beliefs regarding [[African people|Africans]] and African-Americans in more private settings. He speaks of the inherent dignity of the native Africans and his hopes for African-Americans in the future. His relationship of mutual love with the people of Zaire is contrasted with Foreman's awkward and unsuccessful efforts to build his own popularity. Promoter [[Don King]] is seen working on his first big promotion.\n\nPerformers such as [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[B.B. King]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]] are seen performing at [[Zaire 74]], the \"black [[Woodstock]]\" [[soul music]] festival that was supposed to accompany the fight, but ended up preceding it by a month because Foreman was injured in training and the fight was delayed (the festival is more fully documented in the 2008 film ''[[Soul Power (film)|Soul Power]]'').<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last = Fawcett\n  | first = Thomas\n  | title = SXSW Film: Daily Reviews and Interviews\n  | newspaper = Austin Chronicle\n  | date = 2009-03-20\n  | url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A756486\n  }}\n</ref>\n\nThe film culminates with footage of much of the fight itself, interspersed with analysis of Ali's repeated use of the \"right-hand lead\" in the early rounds (a rarely used punch in professional boxing because it opens the boxer up for easy counterattacks, which Ali surmised would make it the punch for which Foreman was the least prepared) and his famous \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy. This technique entailed Ali taking heavy blows from Foreman over several rounds while using his quick reflexes and the ropes to lessen their impact, which wore out Foreman. Ali  knocked out Foreman in the eighth round, regaining the championship taken from him seven years earlier for his refusal to be [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nA soundtrack album for the film was released in 1997. It features live festival performances, in addition to new music by [[Zelma Davis]], the duet \"When We Were Kings\" performed by [[Brian McKnight]] and [[Diana King]], and \"[[Rumble in the Jungle (song)|Rumble in the Jungle]]\", the final recording done by [[The Fugees]], in a collaboration with [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[John Fort\u00e9]].\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n''When We Were Kings'' is regarded as one of the best boxing documentaries ever made. It maintains a 98% positive rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]<ref name=\"rt\" /> and received strong reviews from critics such as [[Roger Ebert]]<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/when-we-were-kings-1997| work=rogerebert.com|title=When We Were Kings}}</ref> and Edward Guthmann.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/02/14/DD30399.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Edward | last=Guthmann | title=When Ali Was Young, Pretty and Powerful | date=2011-01-10}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding News, Talk or Information - Special]] in 1998, but lost to ''Dinner with Oprah: A Lifetime Exclusive - Toni Morrison''.\n\nThe film won the 1996 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].<ref name=\"NY Times\" /> At the presentation, both Ali and Foreman came up to join the filmmakers to make it clear they had long-since made peace after the fight, with Foreman even helping Ali up the stairs. It was also nominated for the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics)|Grand Prix]] of the [[Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0118147}}\n* {{Allmovie title|135880}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=444200}}\n* {{AFI film|60619}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6642-when-we-were-kings-ready-to-fight ''When We Were Kings: Ready to Fight''] an essay by [[Kelefa Sanneh]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Muhammad Ali Footer}}\n{{George Foreman}}\n{{Leon Gast}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''When We Were Kings''\n|list =\n{{Academy Award Best Documentary Feature}}\n{{Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 documentary films]]\n[[Category:American sports documentary films]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about boxing]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about Muhammad Ali]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Leon Gast]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1974]]\n[[Category:Gramercy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
