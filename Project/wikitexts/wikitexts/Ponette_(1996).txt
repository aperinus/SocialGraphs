The film centers on four-year-old Ponette ([[Victoire Thivisol]]), who is coming to terms with the death of her mother in a car crash.\n\nThe film received acclaim for Thivisol's performance, who was only four at the time of filming.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBefore the film begins, Ponette's mother dies in a car crash, which Ponette herself survives with only a broken arm (she consequently must wear an arm cast).\n\nFollowing her mother's death, Ponette's father (Xavier Beauvois) leaves the young girl with her Aunt Claire ([[Claire Nebout]]), and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz). Ponette and her cousins are later sent to a [[boarding school]]. There the loss of her mother becomes even more harsh and painful when she is mocked on the playground for being motherless.<ref name= \"NYT\"> [https://web.archive.org/web/20071102083708/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/136160/Ponette/overview The New York Times Movies] </ref> \n\nNot yet having come to terms with her mother's death, Ponette searches for her.<ref name= \"NYT\"/> Ponette becomes increasingly withdrawn, and spends most of her time waiting for her mother to come back.\n\nWhen waiting alone fails, Ponette enlists the help of her school friend Ada (L\u00e9opoldine Serre) to help her become a \"child of God\" to hopefully convince God to return her mother, in vain. \n\nIn the end, Ponette visits a cemetery and cries for her mother, who suddenly appears to comfort her and ask her to live her life and not be sad all the time. Her mother (played by [[Marie Trintignant]]) says she cannot keep coming back, so Ponette must move on and go be happy with her father.\n\nThen it appears that her mother gives her a sweater that she did not bring to the cemetery, and her father comments when he sees her that \"I haven't seen that sweater in a while\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Victoire Thivisol]] as Ponette\n* Delphine Schiltz as Delphine\n* Matiaz Bureau Caton as Matiaz\n* L\u00e9opoldine Serre as Ada\n* [[Marie Trintignant]] as Mother\n* [[Xavier Beauvois]] as Father\n* [[Claire Nebout]] as Aunt Claire\n\n==Critical response==\nOn the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 91%, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ponette/|title=Ponette (1996)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"|Award / Film Festival\n! scope=\"col\"|Category\n! scope=\"col\"|Recipients and nominees\n! scope=\"col\"|Result\n|-\n|[[National Board of Review Awards 1997|National Board of Review Award]]\n|Top Foreign Films\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[1997 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Circle Award]]\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[Online Film Critics Society Awards 1997|Online Film Critics Society Award]]\n|[[Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Online Film & Television Association Award\n|Best Breakthrough Performance - Female\n|[[Victoire Thivisol]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Foreign Language Film\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival]]\n|Critics Prize\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[2nd Golden Satellite Awards|Satellite Award]]\n|[[Satellite Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[Society of Texas Film Critics Awards]]\n|Best Foreign Film\n!\n| {{yes|2nd place}}\n|-\n|rowspan=5|[[53rd Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]]\n|[[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]]\n|Victoire Thivisol\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[FIPRESCI Prize]]\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|OCIC Award\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Sergio Trasatti Award\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[Golden Lion]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[19th Youth in Film Awards|Young Artist Award]]\n|Best Family Foreign Film\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Young Performer in a Foreign Film\n|Victoire Thivisol\n| {{won}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{imdb title|0117359|Ponette}}\n\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jacques Doillon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Alain Sarde]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Philippe Sarde]]"}]}}}}
