The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|17th Disney animated feature film]], it was directed by [[Hamilton Luske]], [[Clyde Geronimi]] and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] and written by [[Bill Peet]], and features the voices of [[Rod Taylor]], Cate Bauer, [[Betty Lou Gerson]], [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]], [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]], and [[Martha Wentworth]]. The film's plot follows a litter of [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] puppies who are kidnapped by the villainous [[Cruella de Vil]] (\"deVille\"),<ref>Disney-produced 1961 advertising used the \"deVille\" spelling.\"101 Dalmatians\" (Orpheum Theater advertisement).

Please add nothing without removing something first/making sure it's absolutely necessary!-->\nAspiring songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in [[London]], in a [[bachelor pad|bachelor flat]] with his pet [[Dalmatian (dog)|dalmatian]] dog, Pongo. Deciding both of them need a \"mate\", Pongo watches women and their dogs in the street. Noticing Anita and her Dalmatian Perdita, he drags Roger to the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita fall in love, and soon marry, with Pongo and Perdita attending.\n\nThe pair hires a [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|nanny]] and moves to a small townhouse near [[Regent's Park]]. After Perdita becomes pregnant with a litter of 15 puppies, Anita's spoiled, fur-obsessed former schoolmate, [[Cruella de Vil]], arrives and arrogantly demands to know when the puppies will arrive. Roger responds by writing a [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians#Music|jazzy song]] mocking her. When the puppies are born, Cruella returns, demanding to buy them. Roger firmly denies her request; Cruella swears revenge, and storms out.\n\nA few months later, Nanny puts the puppies to bed after a night of watching television, while Pongo and Perdita go for a walk with Roger and Anita at the park. Brothers Horace and Jasper Baddun, two [[burglar]]s secretly hired by Cruella, pose as repair men from an electric company and steal the puppies. The Radcliffes respond by enlisting [[Scotland Yard]] and putting out newspaper advertisements. Roger immediately suspects Cruella, but a police investigation offers no evidence against her.\n\nDuring a walk in the park, Pongo contacts Danny the [[Great Dane]] at [[Hampstead]], who forwards his request for help to dogs all over England via the Twilight Bark gossip chain. In [[Withermarsh Green]], Old Towser the [[bloodhound]] notifies the Colonel, a [[Old English Sheepdog|Sheepdog]], and his cat friend Sgt. Tibbs. Both investigate the nearby \"Old De Vil Place,\" where puppies had been heard barking two nights earlier. Tibbs sneaks inside, learns the truth, and flees, narrowly escaping being killed by Jasper. The Colonel sends word back to London that the puppies are found; Pongo and Perdita leave through a back window and begin a long cross-country journey, crossing an icy river and running through the snow towards Suffolk.\n\nMeanwhile, Cruella tells the Baddun brothers that the police suspect the truth, and orders them to kill and skin the puppies by dawn. After she leaves, Tibbs helps the puppies escape through a hole in the wall, but the Baddun brothers notice and give chase. The Colonel meets up with and notifies Pongo and Perdita, who attack the  Badduns, destroying part of the house and giving the puppies time to flee. Pongo and Perdita reunite with their litter at Colonel and Tibbs' home farm, only to discover there are 84 more puppies with them. After Tibbs explains that Cruella intends to make [[fur coat]]s out of the puppies, Pongo and Perdita decide to take all 99 home with them.\n\nThe Dalmatians start their homeward trek, pursued by the Baddun brothers. They shelter from a blizzard in a [[dairy farm]] with a friendly [[Rough Collie|collie]] and some cows, then make their way to Dinsford, where they meet a [[Black Labrador]] waiting for them in a [[blacksmith]]'s shop. Cruella and the Baddun brothers catch up, so Pongo has his entire family roll in a [[soot]]y fireplace to disguise themselves as other Labradors. The Labrador helps them board a moving van bound for London, but melting snow falls on Lucky and exposes his spots. Cruella pursues and tries to ram the moving van off the road. The Baddun brothers, in their truck, attempt the same thing, but accidentally ram Cruella's car instead, sending both their vehicles into a ditch. The moving van continues to London as Cruella throws a tantrum, with an exasperated Jasper telling her to be quiet.\n\nIn London, a melancholy Nanny and the Radcliffes try to enjoy [[Christmas]], and the wealth they have acquired from the song about Cruella, which has become a big radio hit. The soot-covered Dalmatians suddenly flood the house. Upon removing the soot and counting the massive family of dogs, Roger chooses to use his songwriting royalties to buy a big house in the country, forming a \"Dalmatian Plantation.\" All the dogs of London begin barking, celebrating the return of the Dalmatians.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Pongo, Roger's pet, Perdita's mate, and the father of 15, and adopted father of the eighty-four orphaned puppies.\n* Lisa Daniels and Cate Bauer as Perdita, Anita's pet, Pongo's mate, and the mother of 15 and adopted mother of 84 orphaned puppies. She is an amalgamation of the characters \"Perdita\" and \"Missis\" from the original novel.\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as [[Cruella de Vil]], a spoiled heiress who \"worships fur\" and hates being denied or disobeyed. She drives a burgundy car similar to a [[Mercedes-Benz 500K]] Cabriolet. \n**Gerson also voiced Miss Birdwell, a panelist on the show \"What's My Crime?\". \n**[[Mary Wickes]] served as Cruella's live-action model.\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Roger Radcliffe, Pongo's owner and Anita's husband. He works as a songwriter and later creates a hit song about Cruella de Vil, whom he dislikes and does not trust.\n**[[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] provided Roger's singing voice.\n* [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] as Anita Radcliffe, Perdita's owner and Roger's wife. She is, like Perdita, a gentle person. She feels inclined to give Cruella the benefit of the doubt, as they went to school together.\n**[[Helene Stanley]] served as Anita's live-action model.\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] as Horace Baddun, one of the Baddun brothers. He is more intelligent than his brother (he figures out all the dogs' plots) but completely cowed by Jasper's overwhelming personality into thinking he is stupid. He loves \"What's My Crime?\", a spoof of the then-popular TV gameshow ''[[What's My Line?]]''.\n**Worlock also voiced Inspector Graves, a panelist on the show \"What's My Crime?\".\n* [[J. Pat O'Malley]] as Jasper Baddun, one of the Baddun brothers. He is a fast talker and aggressive bully who completely disregards the possibility of intelligence in dogs. He also loves \"What's My Crime?\" and drives a brown van with loose/broken fenders.\n**O'Malley also voiced the Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog who is part of the Twilight Bark. He, Tibbs, and Captain allow the Dalmatian family to stay in their barn one night and attack the Badduns to buy Pongo and Perdy time to escape.\n* [[Martha Wentworth]] as Nanny, the Radcliffes' elderly cook and housekeeper. She is very maternal and fussy, detests Cruella, and is very attached to the puppies. \n**Wentworth also voiced Queenie, one of three cows who allow the puppies to stay in their barn and drink their milk.\n**Wentworth voiced Lucy the White Goose as well. Lucy is a friend of Old Towser.\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Captain, a [[gray horse]] who aids Pongo, Perdy, Sergeant Tibbs and Colonel. \n* [[David Frankham]] as Sergeant Tibbs, a [[tabby cat]] who is the first to discover the puppies' whereabouts and masterminds their escape from the Old de Vil Place.\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Lucky, one of Pongo and Perdita's litter, who has a horseshoe of spots on his back. He loves watching TV and struggles the most on the journey home.\n* Barbara Beaird as Rolly, a puppy who is always hungry and is shown as pudgier than the rest of the puppies. He even risks stealing food from Horace and is usually in some trouble. \n* Mickey Maga as Patch, a puppy who loves Thunderbolt and has a spot on his eye. Patch is often seen barking and growling at threats. He is the main character of ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''.\n* Sandra Abbott as Penny, a puppy whose name likely references the original novel, which describes Dalmatians's spots being \"about the size of a [[Twopence (British pre-decimal coin)|two-penny]] piece\".\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Old Towser, a [[bloodhound]] who helps spread the news about the stolen puppies.\n* George Pelling as Danny, a [[Great Dane]] who aids Pongo and Perdita and is one of the first dogs to answer Pongo's Twilight Bark message.\n* [[Junius Matthews]] as Scottie, Danny's terrier friend.\n* [[Queenie Leonard]] as Princess, one of the three cows who help the puppies.\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Duchess, one of the three cows who help the puppies.\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Rover, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella bought.\n* [[Rickie Sorensen]] as Spotty, one of the 84 Dalmatian puppies that Cruella bought.\n* [[Tom Conway]] as the [[Rough Collie|Collie]], who offers the Dalmatians shelter for the night at a [[dairy farm]]. \n** Conway also voiced the Quizmaster, the host of \"What's My Crime?\".\n* Ramsay Hill as the [[Labrador Retriever]] in Dinsford, who helps load the puppies into the moving van.\n* [[Paul Wexler (actor)|Paul Wexler]] as the Mechanic who fixes the van.\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as the driver of the moving van.\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Dirty Dawson, the villain in the \"Thunderbolt\" TV show. Frees has no spoken dialogue in the film, only laughter.\n* [[Lucille Bliss]] as TV Commercial Singer, who sings the \"Kanine Krunchies\" jingle.\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nDodie Smith wrote the book ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' in 1956.

Bill Peet did retain a scene in which Pongo and Perdita exchange wedding vows in unison with their owners, by which the censor board warned that it might offend certain religious audiences if the animals repeated the exact words of a solemn religious ceremony.

The earliest of these endeavors was the 1996 live-action remake, ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'', which starred [[Glenn Close]] as Cruella De Vil. Unlike the original film, none of the animals had speaking voices in this version. Its success in theaters led to ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'', released on November 22, 2000.\n\n====TV series====\nAfter the first live-action version of the film, an animated series titled ''[[101 Dalmatians: The Series]]'' was launched. The characters' designs were stylized further to allow for economic animation and to appeal to contemporary trends.\n\n''[[101 Dalmatian Street]]'' is the second TV series with a plot in the 21st century, with a new art style and a concept loosely based on the source material. Set 60 years after the original animated film, the show focuses on Dylan and Dolly, (who are both descendants of Pongo and Perdita) caring for their 97 younger siblings who all live without a human in [[Camden Town]].\n\n====Sequel====\n''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]'', the official sequel to the original animated film, was released [[direct-to-video]] on January 21, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.dvdizzy.com/101dalmatiansII.html |title = 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure - Special Edition DVD Review |work = dvdizzy.com |publisher =
