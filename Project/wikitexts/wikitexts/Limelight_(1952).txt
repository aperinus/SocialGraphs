In dance scenes, Bloom is doubled by [[Melissa Hayden (dancer)|Melissa Hayden]].\n\nUpon the film's release, critics' reception was divided; it was heavily boycotted in the United States because of Chaplin's alleged communist sympathies, and [[Box-office bomb|failed commercially]]. However, the film was re-released in the United States in 1972, which included its first screening in Los Angeles. This allowed the decades-old film to be in contention for the [[45th Academy Awards]] where Chaplin won his only competitive [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. Today, the film is sometimes regarded as one of Chaplin's best and most personal works, and has attained a [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Limelight promo crop.jpg|thumb|''Limelight'' (1952) was a serious and autobiographical film for Chaplin. His character, Calvero, is an ex\u2013[[music hall]] star (described in this image as a \"Tramp Comedian\") forced to deal with his loss of popularity.]]\nThe movie is set in London in 1914, on the eve of World War I, and the year Chaplin made his first film. Calvero ([[Charlie Chaplin]]), once a famous stage clown, but now a washed-up drunk, saves a young dancer, Thereza \"Terry\" Ambrose ([[Claire Bloom]]), from a suicide attempt. Nursing her back to health, Calvero helps Terry regain her self-esteem and resume her dancing career. In doing so, he regains his own self-confidence, but an attempt to make a comeback is met with failure. Terry says she wants to marry Calvero despite their age difference; however, she has befriended Neville ([[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Earl Chaplin]]), a young composer who Calvero believes would be better suited to her. In order to give them a chance, Calvero leaves home and becomes a street entertainer. Terry, now starring in her own show, eventually finds Calvero and persuades him to return to the stage for a [[benefit concert]]. Reunited with an old partner ([[Buster Keaton]]), Calvero gives a triumphant comeback performance. He suffers a heart attack during a routine, however, and dies in the wings while watching Terry, the second act on the bill, dance on stage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as Calvero\n* [[Claire Bloom]] as Thereza \"Terry\" Embrose\n* [[Nigel Bruce]] as Postant\n* [[Buster Keaton]] as Calvero's partner\n* [[Sydney Chaplin (American actor)|Sydney Earl Chaplin]] as Ernest Neville\n* [[Norman Lloyd]] as Bodalink\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Eglevsky]] as Male Ballet Dancer\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Mrs. Alsop\n* [[Wheeler Dryden]] as Thereza's doctor and Old Ballet Dancer\n* [[Melissa Hayden (dancer)|Melissa Hayden]] as Terry's dance double\n* Barry Bernard as John Redfern\n* Stapleton Kent as Claudius (scene cut for worldwide release)\n* Mollie Glessing as Maid\n* [[Leonard Mudie]] as Calvero's Doctor\n* [[Snub Pollard]] as Street Musician\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Little Girl{{sfn|The Criterion Collection staff|2015|p=3}} in opening scene (uncredited)\n* [[Josephine Chaplin]] as Child{{sfn|The Criterion Collection staff|2015|p=3}} in opening scene (uncredited)\n* [[Michael Chaplin (actor)|Michael Chaplin]] as Child{{sfn|The Criterion Collection staff|2015|p=3}} in opening scene (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Spencer Chaplin III|Charles Chaplin III]] as Clown<ref name=criterion /> (uncredited)\n* [[Cyril Delevanti]] as Griffin&nbsp;\u2014 a Clown (uncredited)\n* [[Oona O'Neill]] as Extra (Thereza's double in one episode, uncredited)\n* Eric Wilton as Major Domo at Dinner (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Chaplin - Bloom - 1952-1.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]] in ''Limelight'' ]]\nAlthough the film is set in London, it was entirely filmed in the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] area, mostly at the Chaplin Studios. The street where Calvero lives was a redressed set at [[Paramount Studios]], the music hall scenes were filmed at [[RKO-Path\u00e9 studios]], and some exterior scenes use back-projected footage of London. Filming took 55 days.{{sfn|The Criterion Collection staff|2015|p=30}} Chaplin prominently featured members of [[Chaplin family|his family]] in the film, including five of his children and his half-brother [[Wheeler Dryden]]. Chaplin chose stage actress [[Claire Bloom]] for the role of Terry, her first major film role.{{sfn|The Criterion Collection staff|2015|p=34}} Chaplin told his older sons he expected ''Limelight'' to be his last film. By all accounts, he was very happy and energized during production, a fact often attributed to the joy of recreating his early career in the [[music hall]]. Chaplin biographers have assumed that his character in the film was based on his father, Charles Chaplin Sr., who had also lost his audience and became an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], which led to his death in 1901. In both his 1964 autobiography and his 1974 book, ''My Life in Pictures'', however, Chaplin insists that Calvero is based on the life of stage actor [[Frank Tinney]]. ''Limelight'' was made during a time where Chaplin was starting to lose his audience, too; in many ways, the movie was highly autobiographical.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\nThe pairing of Chaplin and [[Buster Keaton]] in the final musical number is historic for being the only time the two performed together on film.<ref name=criterion /> Chaplin, at first, had not written the part for Keaton, because he believed that the role was too small. It was not until he learned that Keaton was going through hard times that Chaplin insisted Keaton be cast in the film: Before ''Limelight'', Keaton had gone through a disastrous marriage, lost most of his fortune in the divorce process, and had appeared infrequently in films in the preceding years. A rumor has persisted, fueled by the intense rivalry among fans of the two comics, that Keaton gave such a superior performance that Chaplin jealously cut his scenes so he would not be upstaged by his rival. A close associate of Chaplin claimed that Chaplin not only did not feel threatened by Keaton's performance, but also heavily edited his own footage of the duet while enhancing Keaton's. According to Keaton's biographer [[Rudi Blesh]], Chaplin eased his notoriously rigid directorial style to give Keaton free rein to invent his own comic business during this sequence. Keaton's widow Eleanor said that he was thrilled with his appearance in the film, and believed that his business partner, [[Raymond Rohauer]], started and fueled the rumors.<ref>Keaton, Eleanor and Jeffrey Vance.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a brilliant weaving of comic and tragic strands, eloquent, tearful and beguiling with supreme virtuosity,\" though he conceded, \"One tangible weakness of the film is the garrulous discussion of human foibles and paradoxes that Mr. Chaplin permits himself.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=October 24, 1952 |title=The Screen: Chaplin's 'Limelight' Opens |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 }}</ref> Gene Arneel of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"As the focal character on the screen, Chaplin is, at times, magnificent.

Outside of cinemas in several East Coast cities, the film was not seen by the American moviegoing public. It was not until 1972 that the film was finally seen in wide American release.
