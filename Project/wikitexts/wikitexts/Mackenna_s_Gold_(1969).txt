Lee Thompson]], starring an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Gregory Peck]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Telly Savalas]], [[Ted Cassidy]], [[Camilla Sparv]] and [[Julie Newmar]] in lead roles. It was photographed in [[Super Panavision 70]] and [[Technicolor]] by Joseph MacDonald, with original music by [[Quincy Jones]].\n\n''Mackenna's Gold'' is based on the novel of the same name by [[Heck Allen]] using the [[pen name]] Will Henry, telling the story of how the lure of gold corrupts a diverse group of people. The novel was loosely based on the legend of the [[Lost Adams Diggings]], crediting the [[Frank Dobie]] account of the legend (''Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver'') in the author's note. The film was a box-office failure in North America, but went on to become a major overseas success, in regions such as the Soviet Union, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.\n\n==Plot==\nAn old legend tells of a fortune in gold hidden in the \"Ca\u00f1on del Oro\" (\"Canyon of Gold\"), later called the \"Lost Adams\", guarded by [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] spirits. A man named Adams is said to have found it when he was young, only to have the Native Americans capture and blind him. Years later, Marshal MacKenna is ambushed by an old Native American shaman named Prairie Dog, and is forced to kill him. MacKenna thereby comes into possession of a map to the treasure. He examines it before burning it.\n\nMexican outlaw John Colorado and his gang have been tracking Prairie Dog to get the map; they are themselves being tracked by the US Cavalry. They take shelter in the house of an old judge in Hadleyburg, kill the judge, and kidnap his daughter, Inga. Colorado captures MacKenna, intending to force him to lead them to the gold. The gang includes Colorado's right-hand man Sanchez and several Native Americans, among them an Apache warrior named Hachita and a fiery Apache woman, Hesh-ke. Hesh-ke and MacKenna were once lovers, but she rejected him after he arrested her brother, who was tried and hanged.\n\nBen Baker, a gambler who knows Colorado, arrives with assorted townsmen who have learned about Colorado's plans when one of Colorado's men got drunk in town and said too much. Colorado is forced to allow them to join his party. The townsmen include the blind Adams himself. MacKenna warns them to return home, that they will just get themselves killed searching for gold that does not exist, but Colorado reveals that MacKenna shot Prairie Dog, and they stay.\n\nThe cavalry, led by Sergeant Tibbs, ambushes the party at a water hole, and most members of the gang are killed. The remaining gold hunters continue on their way, and as they near the canyon MacKenna and Inga begin to fall in love. A jealous Hesh-Ke now wants MacKenna back.\n\nWhen the cavalry patrol is whittled down to just Tibbs and two others, Tibbs kills them and joins the gang. After a shoot-out with the Apaches, they reach \"Shaking Rock\", a feature on the map. MacKenna tells Colorado they will see the canyon the next morning. He warns Inga to be alert for any opportunity to escape. When she protests that she too wants some gold, he tells her there is no gold, that he has been bluffing.\n\nThe next morning, when the first sunlight shines down, the shadow of the pinnacle of \"Shaking Rock\" starts to move. The shadow eventually points to a hidden passageway. On the other side, they see below them a huge vein of gold in the canyon wall opposite. As everyone races to it, Hesh-ke tries to kill Inga, but Inga fights back and Hesh-ke falls to her death. MacKenna, suspecting that Colorado does not intend to leave anybody else alive, tries to escape with Inga up the canyon wall. Tibbs is killed by Hachita with a tomahawk. Colorado then pulls his gun on Hachita, only to find that his weapon is unloaded. Hachita removed the bullets, as the spirits had told him to do, but he turns his back on Colorado, who kills him with a thrown knife.\n\nColorado pursues MacKenna and Inga, catching up to them at an ancient, abandoned Native American dwelling high up the cliff. They fight, but are interrupted when Apaches enter the canyon, shouting excitedly. The noise and the pounding of their horses triggers a rockfall which causes the valley floor to buckle and quake. The Apaches flee. The three survivors descend the cliff and frantically ride away, barely escaping the collapse of the canyon walls, which buries the gold beyond reach.\n\nColorado warns MacKenna to stay away from him, but MacKenna tells him to go far away and hide, that he will be coming after him. MacKenna and Inga ride off together, unaware that the saddle bags of the horse MacKenna is riding is stuffed with gold nuggets.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Marshal Sam MacKenna\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as John Colorado\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as Sergeant Tibbs\n* [[Camilla Sparv]] as Inga Bergemann\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Sanchez\n* [[Julie Newmar]] as Hesh-Ke\n* [[Ted Cassidy]] as Hachita\n* [[Lee J.

According to the legend, a teamster named Adams and some prospectors in Arizona were approached by a Mexican Native American named Gotch Ear, who offered to show them a canyon filled with gold. However, in the novel as well as the film, the gang abducts a Marshal named MacKenna to find a way to the Canyon.\n\nThe film also adapts elements from another work, ''Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver'' (1939) by [[J. Frank Dobie]], a collection of tales about the fabulous treasures of the Southwest, based on the legend of the \"Lost Adams Diggins\".\n\n===Title===\nAlthough Allen's novel title and hero shared the same spelling of the name \"Mackenna\", and the film's title according to the studio is \"Mackenna's Gold\", Peck's character is listed in publicity materials as \"MacKenna\".\n\n==Development==\nFilm rights were purchased by Highroad Productions, the company of writer-producer Carl Foreman, who had a deal with Columbia.

He originally believed that he would have to make the movie in Spain where it could be done for below the line costs of $2.2 million, while a USA shoot would cost $3.2 million. However, on further research, Foreman felt a US shoot would cost only 10% more than a foreign one.<ref name=\"los\" /> He was persuaded to make the movie in America to use the Grand Canyon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Producer Carl Foreman to Return to Hollywood|author=Palmer, Raymond|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Feb 1, 1967|page=e9}}</ref> (The budget would eventually rise to $7 million.)\n\nIn January 1967, it was announced the film would be shot in Cinerama.

It was sung by [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]] and was composed by [[Quincy Jones]] with lyrics by Freddie Douglas. 'Freddie Douglas' was a pseudonym for writer/producer Carl Foreman. [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]] also plays guitar and add vocals in many parts of the soundtrack and Spanish version of the theme song \"Viejo Butre\" for the Spanish-language edition of the movie.\n\nThe theme song was used on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in 2007 as a random running gag. A 13-second clip would be played after Letterman threw his blue index cards through the \"glass\" window behind his desk, and was often combined with a video clip of the turkey buzzard soaring in the sky during the movie's opening sequence. Letterman would gradually show increased mock irritation with the clip in discussions with bandleader [[Paul Shaffer]], while at the same time calling it \"exciting, moving, inspirational\" and \"stirring, haunting, beautiful\". The running gag ultimately resulted in Feliciano making a guest appearance on the ''Late Show'' on October 16, 2007, singing a longer version of the song (with the buzzard video clip superimposed over him).\n\n===Track listing===\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Track listing\n| total_length    = 37:37\n| title1          = Overture\n| length1         = 4:36\n| title2          = Old Turkey Buzzard\n| length2         = 2:46\n| title3          = Canon del Oro\n| length3         = 5:13\n| title4          = Waterhole Trek\n| length4         = 2:37\n| title5          = Reve Parisien\n| length5         = 2:40\n| title6          = Old Turkey Buzzard <small>(Instrumental version)</small>\n| length6         = 2:30\n| title7          = Soul Full o Gold\n| length7         = 2:40\n| title8          = Main Title\n| length8         = 3:00\n| title9          = Apache Camp\n| length9         = 4:36\n| title10         = Massacre Montage\n| length10        = 2:42\n| title11         = Old Turkey Buzzard <small>(Spanish version)</small>\n| length11        = 1:30\n| title12         = Finale\n| length12        = 2:47\n}}\n\n===Personnel===\n* Orchestrations by Leo Shuken, Jack Hayes, and Hal Mooney.
