The film is a spin-off from his [[BBC Television]] series ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and satirises [[Anglo American relations#War on Terrorism and Iraq War|Anglo-American politics]], in particular the [[invasion of Iraq]].<ref name=\"Guard\">Xan Brooks, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/21/armando-iannucci-iraq-satire-sundance Iannucci's Iraq war satire lauded at Sundance] in ''The Guardian'', 21 January 2009. Retrieved 2010-02-26.</ref> It was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2009]] [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[Federal Government of the United States|US]] are contemplating military intervention in the [[Middle East]], Simon Foster, the Minister for [[Department for International Development|International Development]], unintentionally states that war in the region is \"unforeseeable\" during an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]] programme. The Prime Minister's [[Spin (public relations)|Director of Communications]], [[Malcolm Tucker]], castigates Simon and warns him to [[toe the line]]. Simon's new aide Toby Wright, aided by his girlfriend Suzy, gets Simon into that day's [[UK Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] meeting.\n\nUS [[secretary of state|Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomacy]] Karen Clark, who leads the meeting and opposes military intervention, flags a report by her assistant Liza Weld titled \"Post-War Planning, Parameters, Implications and Possibilities\" (PWPPIP). The report opposes intervention, noting insufficient supporting intelligence other than from unsubstantiated source \"Iceman\". During the meeting it is accidentally disclosed that US [[secretary of state|Assistant Secretary of State for Policy]] Linton Barwick has set up a secret war committee. Ambushed by reporters, Simon says the government must be prepared to \"climb the mountain of conflict\" and is again chastised by Tucker.\n\nBack in the US, Karen and Liza deduce that Linton's secret war committee is named the Future Planning committee. Karen teams up with Lieutenant General George Miller who opposes the war, believing the US has insufficient troops. Karen invites Simon on to the Future Planning committee to \"internationalise the dissent\". Toby accidentally leaks the details of the meeting to a friend at [[CNN]], then meets up with Liza at a bar. They end up sleeping together. Due to Toby's leak the Future Planning committee is swamped. Both Karen and Linton turn to Simon to back their respective causes, but he struggles to say anything meaningful in support of either. Tucker, having been diverted by Linton to the White House for a fake briefing, confronts Linton, who expects Tucker to supply the US with British intelligence to support military intervention.\n\nBack in his [[Northampton]] constituency Simon is lobbied by constituent Paul Michaelson over Simon's constituency office wall, which is in danger of collapsing into Michaelson's mother's garden. Newspapers criticise Simon for inaction on the issue. Suzy breaks up with Toby over his one-night-stand with Liza, and he leaves her a copy of PWPPIP to leak if she wants, but she chastises him for not doing it himself.\n\nThe President vetoes tariffs on Chinese imports to bring forward the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] vote on military intervention. Simon tells his Director of Communications Judy Molloy to leak that he would resign if the Security Council votes in favour. At the UN Tucker hears PWPPIP has been leaked, harming the prospect of a ''yes'' vote. Tucker convinces UK Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Tutt to bring the vote forward two hours so that the leak cannot spread in the US. However, Linton tells Tucker the British intelligence must be delivered prior to a vote. Having made Tutt delay the meeting once more, Tucker, aided by Senior Press Officer Jamie McDonald, fabricates the report by forcing the reluctant Foreign Office's Director of Diplomacy Michael Rodgers to remove all arguments against intervention and presenting it as intelligence. The Security Council approves intervention.\n\nGeorge informs Karen that despite his earlier intention to resign, as a soldier he cannot now that the war is happening. Simon's intention to resign over the war is thwarted when Tucker fires him over the collapsed constituency wall. A new Minister for International Development arrives at the office.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as [[Malcolm Tucker]], Director of Communications for the Prime Minister\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Simon Foster, [[Secretary of State for International Development]] and MP for Northampton.\n* [[Chris Addison]] as Toby Wright, [[Special advisers in the United Kingdom|Special Advisor]] to the Secretary of State for International Development\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Judy Molloy, Director of Communications for the UK [[Department for International Development]]\n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Karen Clark, US Assistant [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] for Diplomacy\n* [[Anna Chlumsky]] as Liza Weld, advisor to Karen Clark\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Lieutenant General George Miller, Senior Military Assistant to the [[United States Secretary of Defense]]\n* [[David Rasche]] as Linton Barwick, US Assistant [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] for Policy\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Bob Adriano, advisor to Assistant Secretary Linton\n* [[Zach Woods]] as Chad, junior staffer at the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]]\n* [[Johnny Pemberton]] as AJ Brown, staffer at the US State Department\n* [[Paul Higgins (actor)|Paul Higgins]] as Jamie McDonald, \"the crossest man in Scotland,\" Senior Press Officer in the Office of the Prime Minister\n* [[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]] as Michael Rodgers, Director of Diplomacy at the UK [[Foreign Office]]\n* [[Olivia Poulet]] as Suzy, civil servant at the Foreign Office and Toby's girlfriend\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Roz, staffer at Simon Foster's constituency office in Northampton\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Paul Michaelson, an aggrieved constituent of Simon Foster\n* [[Alex Macqueen]] as Sir Jonathan Tutt, [[Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations|UK Ambassador to the UN]]\n}}\nThe actors include [[Tom Hollander]], who went on to appear in one episode of ''The Thick of It'', [[Gina McKee]], [[Steve Coogan]], and seven American actors including [[James Gandolfini]], [[Mimi Kennedy]], [[David Rasche]] and [[Anna Chlumsky]], the last of whom later starred in Iannucci's [[HBO]] satire ''[[Veep]]''.

Likewise, Anna Chlumsky and Zach Woods went on to portray similar but nominally different characters in the subsequent American series, ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''.\n\n==Writing==\nThe writing of ''In The Loop'' followed the methods developed during ''[[The Thick of It]]'' television series. Co-writer Jesse Armstrong explained:\n{{cquote|It's exactly the same format as used in ''The Thick of It''. Armando holds it together in the middle. Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and I meet him then come up with the story line. Us three go away and do the storyline then send it to Armando to be okayed and do the initial drafts. Then Ian Martin does additional material and rewrites as well. So it's a five-man team but all broken down into different compartments. It never feels unwieldy.\n\nOnce we had the storyline mapped out with Armando, each of us took an act each, if you think of it as a three-act movie. I had the first crack at the first act, Simon at the second and Tony at the third. We looked at them all, Armando gave us notes and we did another rewrite and passed them around. It's not like one person does the plot, one does the jokes and one does the politics, but we all have our different strengths.}}\nNoting that ''The Thick of It'' had been inspired by the Blair government's attacks on the BBC in the wake of the Iraq war, the magazine ''Cinema Scope'' described ''In The Loop'' as a retelling of the chain of events that inspired Iannucci to devise the series.\"<ref>[http://cinema-scope.com/wordpress/?page_id=980 Cinema Scope &raquo; Features | The Road to In the Loop: British Satire-Sitcom-Cinema].
