The film stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Teri Polo]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].\n\nAfter the commercial success of the first two films in the franchise, both De Niro and Stiller received a [[remuneration]] of $20 million for their roles in ''Little Fockers''.\n\nIn addition to the original cast, ''Little Fockers'' features [[Jessica Alba]], [[Laura Dern]], [[Kevin Hart]], and [[Harvey Keitel]]. Although the film was a box office success, grossing over $310&nbsp;million worldwide, it earned less than its predecessors and was critically panned.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after the events of [[Meet the Fockers|the previous film]], Gaylord \"Greg\" Focker is preparing to celebrate his twins Samantha and Henry's fifth birthday party.\n\nThings seem to go awry when Greg's father-in-law Jack Byrnes visits. Recently, he has been diagnosed with a heart condition and become embittered by his daughter Debbie's divorce from her husband Bob (their marriage was the social event in [[Meet the Parents|the first film]] and how he and Greg met), for cheating on her with a nurse. Jack's original plan was to declare Bob his successor as head of the Byrnes family, but he decides to pass the role to Greg, naming him \"The Godfocker\".\n\nDespite Greg reluctantly accepting the role, Jack resumes his spying on him and begins to suspect him of infidelity when he sees him with drug representative Andi Garcia, who openly flirts with him. This with the presence of Sustengo erection pills in Greg's house prompts Jack to think he is no longer sexually attracted to Pam, his wife. Furthermore, he starts to doubt his ability to provide for his family when he's initially reluctant to send his children to a private school.\n\nDuring a medical conference promoting Sustengo, Greg meets Bob at a bar, who tells him of Jack's original intention to name him as successor, \"The Bobfather\". His relief and happiness at leaving Jack's family makes Greg slightly uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Jack speaks to Pam about the possibility of divorcing Greg and renewing her relationship with her ex-fianc\u00e9, Kevin Rawley.\n\nEventually, following a row at a clinic, Greg escapes to his and Pam's unfinished new house, where Andi turns up. She tries to cheer him up with Chinese food and wine, but she drinks too much (also taking many erection [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]]), making an eccentric, extremely aggressive [[sexual harassment|sexual pass]] on Greg. Jack, looking for him to apologize and bring him home, pulls up to the house and sees through the window what looks like Greg and Andi having sex. Although, he is actually trying to rebuff Andi's advances. Disgusted, Jack leaves, and tells Dina and Pam that he couldn't find him.\n\nGreg's parents, Bernie and Roz, rejoin the family at the twins' birthday party the next day. Enraged at Greg's apparent infidelity, Jack engages him in a physical fight, despite Greg insisting that Andi was drunk and he was rejecting her. The fight ends with Jack having a heart attack and collapsing.\n\nGreg quickly takes charge of the situation, looking after Jack. As paramedics take him away, Jack quietly admits that he believes him after observing his carotid artery remained stable while Greg was proclaiming his innocence. Impressed with his integrity and quick thinking, Jack approves of him to be \"The Gregfocker.\"\n\nFour months later, on Christmas Day, Greg and Pam's parents come to spend Christmas with them in their new house. Greg's parents (being [[Jewish]]) give Jack a [[kippah]] as a present, informing him that while they were nursing him back to health they traced his family roots and discovered that he is part Jewish (which does not impress Jack).\n\nBernie informs Greg and Pam that he and Roz have sold their [[Miami]] home and are moving to [[Chicago]], only two houses down from theirs. Jack and Dina decide they will move too, because they also want to be close to their grandchildren. Greg and Pam try to wean their respective parents off the idea. During the [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Jack views [[YouTube]] videos of Greg publicly mocking Jack during a speech promoting Sustengo.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Jack Byrnes\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Greg Focker\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Kevin Rawley\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Bernie Focker\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Roz Focker\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Dina Byrnes\n* [[Teri Polo]] as Pam Focker\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Andi Garcia\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Prudence\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Nurse Louis\n* [[Daisy Tahan]] as Samantha Focker\n* Colin Baiocchi as Henry Focker\n* [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]] as Dr. Bob\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Randy Weir\n* [[Yul Vazquez]] as Junior\n* [[Olga Fonda]] as Svetlana\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Sleazy Doctor\n* [[John DiMaggio]] and [[Jordan Peele]] as E.M.T.s\n* [[Deepak Chopra]] as Himself\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Young Doctor\n\n==Production==\nProduction for ''Little Fockers'' began in July 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title = 'Little Fockers' A Go: Report |first = Katherine |last = Thomson |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/25/little-fockers-a-go-repor_n_178893.html |newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]] |date = March 25, 2009 |access-date = August 2, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607001037/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/25/little-fockers-a-go-repor_n_178893.html |url-status = live |archive-date = June 7, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Those 'Little Fockers' find their director |first = Erik |last = Buckman |url = http://blog.reelloop.com/1424/news/little-fockers-find-director/ |work = Reel Loop |date = April 7, 2009 |access-date = August 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nWriter John Hamburg stated the film would deal with \"themes of death and divorce and all these real things that, as we get older, we start to think about, but in a really comical way.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = Little Fockers Exclusive |first = Joe |last = Utichi |first2 = Chris |last2 = Tilly |url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/993/993418p1.html |work = [[IGN]] |date = June 10, 2009 |access-date = August 2, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090613010217/http://movies.ign.com/articles/993/993418p1.html |url-status = live |archive-date = June 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nOutside the United States, this is the first film in the series to be released by [[Paramount Pictures]], which acquired the [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] back catalog in 2006 (and owned the studio itself until 2008), including co-ownership in the ''Meet the Parents'' franchise.

As such, they had to shoot the scenes and edit them to fit his character into the movie.\n\n==Release==\nIn January 2010, the release date for the film was pushed back from July 30, 2010, to December 22, 2010, nominally because Universal hoped to benefit from the long Christmas weekend; it was later revealed to be deliberately delayed as such because it was only at the time of the delay announcement that Hoffman elected to reprise his character, and the producers had to adjust the filming schedule to accommodate for the filming of his scenes, keeping the announcement secret until the aforementioned August reveal.<ref>{{cite news |title = Waiting for 'Little Fockers' |first = Andrew |last = Stewart |url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118014434.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher = [[Reed Business Information]] |date = January 28, 2010 |access-date = August 2, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first trailer was released on June 24, 2010.
