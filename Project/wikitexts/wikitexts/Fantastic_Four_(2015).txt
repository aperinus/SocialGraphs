Directed by [[Josh Trank]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jeremy Slater]] and [[Simon Kinberg]], it stars [[Miles Teller]], [[Michael B. Jordan]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Jamie Bell]] and [[Toby Kebbell]]. The film follows a group of intelligent teenagers that build a transdimensional portal, causing them to gain superhuman abilities.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] announced plans to reboot the franchise, and development of the film began in 2009. Trank was hired to direct in July 2012 and the principal characters were cast in January 2014. Principal photography began in May 2014 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]] and lasted for two months. Dissatisfied with the director's original cut, Fox executives mandated [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|reshoots]], which took place in January 2015.\n\n''Fantastic Four'' premiered at [[Williamsburg Cinemas]] in New York City on August 4, 2015, and was released on August 7 in the United States. The film received negative reviews from critics with criticism for its dark tone, direction, lack of humor, cast performances, character development, pacing, writing, unfaithfulness to the source material, narrative, visuals, and CGI, although there was some praise for the musical score. It grossed over $167 million worldwide against a production budget of $155 million, becoming a [[box-office bomb]], losing over $80 million. At the [[36th Golden Raspberry Awards]], it won several awards, including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]. Trank also voiced his displeasure with the final film, blaming the studio's interference.\n\nA sequel was scheduled for a June 9, 2017 release, but was cancelled after the first film's failure. It was the last Fantastic Four film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, as the film rights to the team, along with that of [[X-Men]] and [[Deadpool]], reverted to [[Marvel Studios]] following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in 2019. Another reboot, set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], is scheduled to release on November 8, 2024.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nChildhood friends [[Reed Richards]] and [[Ben Grimm]] have worked together on a prototype [[Teleportation|teleporter]] since youth, eventually attracting the attention of Professor [[Franklin Storm]], director of the Baxter Foundation, a government-sponsored [[research institute]] for young prodigies. Reed is recruited to join them and aid Storm's children, scientist [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and engineer [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], into completing a \"Quantum Gate\" designed by Storm's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]].\n\nThe experiment is successful, and the facility's supervisor, Dr. Allen, plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel dimension]] known as \"Planet Zero\". Disappointed at being denied the chance to join the expedition, Reed, Johnny and Victor along with Ben use the Quantum Gate to embark on an unsanctioned voyage to Planet Zero, which they learn is a world filled with otherworldly substances. Victor attempts to touch the green lava-like substance, causing the ground they are standing on to erupt. Reed, Johnny and Ben return to their shuttle just as Sue brings them back to [[Earth]] and Victor is seemingly killed after he falls into the collapsing landscape. The Quantum Gate explodes, altering Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben on a genetic level and granting them superhuman abilities beyond their control: Reed can stretch like [[Rubber band|rubber]], Sue can become invisible and generate [[force field (fiction)|force fields]], Johnny can engulf his entire body in fire and fly, and Ben acquires a rock-like hide which gives him [[superhuman strength]] and durability. They are then placed in government custody to be studied and have their abilities tested. Blaming himself for the accident, Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for their changes.\n\nOne year later in 2015, Reed is now a fugitive and has built a suit that helps him control his ability. Hiding in [[Central America]], he is eventually found by the United States military with Sue's help and captured by Ben, who has become a military asset along with Johnny and Sue. Johnny and Sue have been outfitted with specialized suits designed to help them control their abilities. Reed is brought to Area 57, where Dr. Allen conscripts him into rebuilding the Quantum Gate in exchange for giving Reed the resources to find a cure. Arriving in Planet Zero, Dr. Allen's explorers find Victor, who has been fused to his spacesuit and now possesses [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities, and bring him back to Earth. Believing that humans need to be destroyed so he can rebuild Earth in his image, Victor kills the scientists and soldiers in the base, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm, and returns to Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate, with Ben, Johnny, Reed and Sue in pursuit.\n\nNow dubbing himself \"Doom\", Victor activates a portal on Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate and begins consuming the landscape of the Earth using a structure he created from the rock formations in Planet Zero. He is confronted by the four and, after a short battle, Ben punches Doom into the portal's energy beam, disintegrating him while Johnny closes the portal. Returning to Earth, the group is rewarded by the US military for their heroics by being given a new base of operations known as \"Central City\" to study their abilities without government interference. They decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the mantle of the \"[[Fantastic Four]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miles Teller]] as [[Reed Richards|Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic]]: Richards has been exploring the universe in his garage after school.
