It originally premiered on March 5, 2000 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' block. The film follows a young girl whose Eve doll (somewhat like [[Barbie]]) is transformed into a real person.\n\nA [[sequel]], titled ''[[Life-Size 2|Life-Size 2: A Christmas Eve]]'', premiered on December 2, 2018 on [[Freeform (TV network)|Freeform]] with [[Tyra Banks]] reprising her role.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Stuart is a [[tomboy]]ish girl who is the [[quarterback]] of her school's 7th-grade football team. Since her mother died two years ago, she has been avoiding her old friends and arguing with a boy on her team. Wanting to bring her mother back to life, Casey finds a book called \"The Book of Awakenings\" at a local [[bookstore]]. The book contains a section on resurrecting the dead and a successful resurrection will become permanent unless it\u2019s undone before sunset on the fourth day after it begins. However, since the book was expensive, she left all the money she had on the shelf in a glass compartment which is where the book was.\n\nFollowing the book's instructions, Casey collects artifacts from her mother's life, including locks of her hair in her hairbrush. However, the resurrection is unwittingly sabotaged when Drew McDonald, a woman who works with and is romantically interested in Casey's widowed father, Ben, gives Casey a mall shopping Eve doll for her birthday.  Eve is a plastic doll in the form of a young pretty woman, manufactured by Marathon Toys. She has many accessories, including outfits appropriate to taxing careers such as law enforcement, medicine and outer space, and lives in Sunnyvale, \"in the middle of America\".\n\nAs Casey is preparing to resurrect her mother, Drew stops by to give her the doll for her birthday and uses the hairbrush to brush the doll's hair. With strands from Casey's Eve doll remaining on the brush as Casey utters the incantation, the magic acts on the doll rather than Casey's mother, and Casey wakes up the next morning to find Eve in bed with her in a real form. Casey is upset by this, but Eve is excited about being a real woman.\n\nOver the next few days, Eve buys clothes at the local shopping mall, uses her police training to stop a truck that almost runs Casey over, smells and eats for the first time, tries and fails miserably to do secretarial work, sings her theme song on stage during a dance with Ben, and almost sets the Stuarts' kitchen on fire. She also helps Casey cope with the loss of her mother. Meanwhile, Casey learns that she needs the second volume of the magic book to reverse Eve's spell.\n\nDuring this time, tension builds between Casey and her father, who has been missing her football games while trying to secure a promotion in his law firm. The tension is further increased by Ben's attraction to Eve, which Casey resents as a betrayal to her mother. Eve helps people turn into a better version of themselves, especially Ellen, Ben's coworker.\n\nAs the film proceeds, Casey and Eve gradually become friends. Eve displays insight and sensitivity in talking with Casey about her mother, and she helps Casey with her self-confidence. In exchange, Casey gives Eve tips on how to be a popular doll and a good role model. By the time the magic book arrives at the local bookstore, Casey has decided she likes Eve, so she does not buy it. Unfortunately, Eve has been getting homesick.\n\nDiscouraged by her difficulties in being a real woman and worried about being cancelled by Marathon, Eve decides to undo the spell herself. After buying the book and saying goodbye to Ben at Casey's championship game, she goes to Sunnyvale, a specially decorated room at Marathon headquarters, and recites the incantation. When Casey and Ben arrive, she tearfully bids them farewell and turns back into a doll. Sometime later, with the lessons learned from her experiences in the real world, Eve becomes a popular toy again. Casey kept her old friendships, Ben is promoted at work and Drew takes him to lunch.\n\nThe film ends with the cast dancing to Eve's theme song (\"Be a Star\"), with an apparently still-real Eve singing and dancing along.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Tyra Banks]] as Eve\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Casey Stuart\n* [[Jere Burns]] as Ben Stuart\n* [[Anne Marie DeLuise|Anne Marie Loder]] as Drew McDonald\n* [[Garwin Sanford]] as Richie\n* [[Tom Butler (actor)|Tom Butler]] as Phil\n* [[Jillian Fargey]] as Ellen\n* Dee Jay Jackson as Coach\n* [[Corrine Koslo]] as Toy store owner\n* Alfred Humphreys as Bookstore owner\n* Kerry Sandomirsky as Ms. Weiner\n* Sam MacMillan as Sam\n* Katelyn Wallace as Sarah\n* Shaina Tianne Unger as Jessica\n* Jessica Lee Owens as Shannon\n* [[Chantal Strand]] as Sarah's sister\n* Laurie Murdoch as Mr. Boring\n* Candice Connelly as Mrs. Boring\n* [[Alvin Sanders]] as Guard\n* Ryan de Boer as Weiner\n* Lesley Ewen as Francine\n* Kaitlyn Burke as Girl with doll\n* George Blondheim as Bandleader\n* Joanna Piros as Newscaster\n* Stephanie Moore as Woman in mink\n* [[Campbell Lane]] as Judge Peterman\n* Kasper Michaels as Litter man\n* Monika Lisowska and Rosa Zavaglia as Mall extras\n* [[Garvin Cross]] as Truck driver\n* [[Aliana Lohan]] as Girl at Football Stands (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was made-for-television. Lohan didn't have to audition for the role of Casey Stuart, the girl whose doll comes to life. The producers of the film offered her the role as a part of a three-picture contract with [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/11/what-really-happened-to-lindsay-lohan-part-2-the-ingenue-172226/|title=What Really Happened To Lindsay Lohan, Part 2: The Ingenue|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Austin|last=Dale|date=February 20, 2012|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}</ref> Banks was given the role of Eve, the doll that is magically transformed into a live woman during Casey's attempt to bring her mother back to life. Costume designer Maya Mani said, \"It was a joy to work with Tyra because she knows how to wear clothes. No matter what we put on her, she could carry it off.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2017/5/1/15473936/life-size-2-costumes|title=Life-Size\u2019s Costume Designer on Dressing Tyra and What Eve Would Wear Today|website=[[Racked|Vox Media]]|first=Elana|last=Fishman|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nStephanie Moore came up with the idea of a doll coming to life. She collaborated with the director, [[Mark Rosman]], on the teleplay for the film. Pre-production began in the summer of 1999, and filming began in October 1999.\n\nThe film begins with a commercial that promotes buying Eve dolls. For the doll commercial, production designer David Fischer deliberately went for a retro 1950s look, similar to the Hanna-Barbera cartoon ''[[The Jetsons]]''. \"It had to look dated but fun and inviting\", said Rosman.\n\nFilming took place for three weeks. For the location, the producers thought [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. would be a good location for the film. The toy store used in the film is named ''Kaboodles''. This is the actual toy store's name, as it wasn't changed during production. It is located in [[Point Grey]] in Vancouver.\n\nThere are British Columbia flags on Ben's license plate, indicating that it is set in Canada . However, also on the license plate, it reads: Evergreen State. The Evergreen State is [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The film was originally going to premiere as a part of ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' on February 27, 2000. It was delayed by one week, and later released on March 5.\n\n===Music===\nGeorge Blondheim and Mark Rosman wrote a song titled \"Be a Star\" that Tyra Banks sings at a business party. The song is the theme song for the film, and was also reprised at the end of the film. Two songs by the Irish girl group [[B*Witched]] were used in the film: \"[[C'est la Vie (B*Witched song)|C'est la Vie]]\" and \"Rollercoaster\". A song from [[Nobody's Angel]]'s [[Nobody's Angel (album)|debut album]], \"Keep Me Away\", was used near the end of the film.\n\n==Sequels==\n{{main|Life-Size 2}}\nA sequel to the movie was first reported in November 2012.<ref>[http://family-room.ew.com/2012/11/26/life-size-sequel-tyra-banks-lindsay-lohan/ Shine bright, shine far!
