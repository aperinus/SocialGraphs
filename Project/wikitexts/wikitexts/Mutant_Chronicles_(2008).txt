The \"machine\" mutates people into barely intelligent killing drones, known as \"mutants\", that drag new victims to the machine for conversion. Sealed away thousands of years ago by human tribes, the machine is accidentally uncovered during a large battle in [[Eastern Europe]] between two (Capitol and Bauhaus) of the four corporations that now rule the world (the other two being Mishima and Imperial). Within six weeks the world is almost completely overrun by the mutant gangs. Some of the population has been evacuated to [[Mars]], but millions remain on the doomed Earth. A group of soldiers are assembled to take another ancient device to the heart of the machine in an attempt to destroy it in a [[suicide mission]]. In return, their loved ones receive coveted tickets to Mars.\n\nEn route their spaceship is shot down by a [[kamikaze]] airship piloted by a mutant. The group is forced to battle through the mutants in tunnels to reach the machine, hoping to save the last of humanity. In their attempt to reach the machine most die, with Mitch being partially transformed into a mutant and Brother Samuel being fully transformed. Mitch is able to halt his own transformation, but is forced to kill Brother Samuel. Mitch, being the last survivor, is ultimately successful in activating the ancient device, causing the machine (which was actually part of a spacecraft) not to be destroyed but to blast off into space.\n\nA dying and mutated Samuel tells him to \"have faith\" as Mitch jumps from the slowly ascending rocket, landing in an underground lake beneath the rocket. Crawling onto land he sees the rocket disappear into the sky, realizing he is the prophesied savior of mankind, despite not believing in a god. Grievously wounded and partially mutated, he unsuccessfully attempts to light a final crooked cigarette. The final plan shows the rocket en route to the red planet.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Sergeant John Mitchell \"Mitch\" Hunter\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Brother Samuel\n* [[Devon Aoki]] as Corporal Valerie Chinois Duval\n* [[Benno F\u00fcrmann]] as Lieutenant Maximillian Emile Von Steiner\n* [[Sean Pertwee]] as Nathan Rooker\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Constantine\n* [[Anna Walton]] as Severian\n* Luis Echegaray as Corporal Jesus \"El Jesus\" de Barrera\n* [[Shauna Macdonald (Scottish actress)|Shauna Macdonald]] as Adelaide\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Corporal Juba Kim Wu\n* [[Steve Toussaint]] as Captain John Patrick McGuire\n* [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Science Monk\n* [[Curtis Walker]] as \"Bigboy\"\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 18% based on {{nowrap|34 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 3.5/10.
