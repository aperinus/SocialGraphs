The film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Amber Heard]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]], [[Charlotte Ross]], [[Katy Mixon]], and [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]]. Photographed in 3D, the film was released on February 25.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words only-->\nJohn Milton escapes from [[Hell]] and steals [[Satan]]'s gun, the Godkiller, in order to kill Jonah King, a Satanistic cult-leader who murdered Milton's daughter and her husband, and plans to ritually sacrifice Milton's infant granddaughter, believing that it will unleash Hell on Earth.\n\nAfter interrogating and killing some of King's followers in [[Colorado]], Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, an abandoned prison in [[Louisiana]]. On his way there, he stops by a diner, where he meets Piper Lee, a waitress. Milton abandons his damaged car and sabotages Piper's 1969 [[Dodge Charger]], offering to fix it in exchange for a ride.\n\nPiper walks in on her boyfriend, Frank, cheating on her. Piper beats the woman and tosses her out and assaults Frank, who knocks Piper unconscious. Milton hears the commotion and comes to Piper's aid. Milton \"borrows\" Frank's car, taking Piper with him to Stillwater. Satan's supernatural operative, The Accountant, arrives on Earth with the mission to retrieve Milton and the gun. The Accountant interrogates Frank and discovers Milton's destination. After killing Frank, he poses as an FBI agent, and tricks a pair of state troopers into helping him.\n\nStopping at a shady hotel, Milton is having sex with a waitress from a nearby bar when King and his men attack. Milton violently dispatches them with many rounds of gunfire, leaving the naked and terrified waitress completely traumatized. The Accountant appears with the police and chases Milton and Piper, who are now hotly pursuing King in his RV. Milton uses the Godkiller to shoot at the Accountant, causing him to drive off a bridge. They follow King to a former church, find it filled with King's Satan-worshipers, and they are ambushed and captured by the cult. They kidnap Piper and shoot Milton in the eye, leaving him for dead. He awakens, kills King's cult, and pursues the RV in the Charger. Piper breaks free, fights King, and jumps through the RV's shattered window onto Milton's car hood. King disables the Charger by shooting its engine.\n\nMilton and Piper meet Milton's friend, Webster, who gives them a 1971 red [[Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]. Piper discovers that Milton is undead and had to abandon his daughter in order to protect her, which allowed King to manipulate her into joining his cult. Webster reveals that Milton died 10 years earlier in a shootout and was a pallbearer at Milton's funeral. Piper also discovers that the Godkiller has the power to completely destroy a soul, preventing it from going to either Heaven or Hell. Meanwhile, one of King's surviving men tells the Accountant why Milton is chasing them.\n\nAfter arming himself, Milton tells Piper and Webster to leave, but Piper says that she has never before had a worthy cause to fight for and is with him regardless of the consequences. With the help of the now-intrigued Accountant, they evade a sheriff's troopers and arrive at Stillwater. The Accountant captures Piper and forces Milton to surrender the Godkiller before he can battle King. He allows Milton to attempt to save his granddaughter, however, noting that Satan despises the sacrifice of innocents in his name.\n\nWhile Milton slaughters King's men before they can sacrifice his grandchild, Piper escapes from The Accountant with the Godkiller. King eventually gets the upper hand on Milton and savagely beats him. Piper fires the Godkiller at King, but misses, knocking herself out. King is enraged when another follower refuses to sacrifice the infant. The Accountant attracts King's attention, allowing Milton to grab the Godkiller and obliterate King forever.\n\nThe Accountant retrieves the infant and allows Milton to say goodbye to his granddaughter. Milton gives her to Piper, who promises to always care for her. Webster arrives and looks on as Milton \"dies\". After both Piper and Webster have left, Milton is revealed to not be fully dead. Milton makes good on his earlier promise to Webster and drinks a beer from the remains of King's skull. He agrees to return to Hell but threatens to escape again if his punishment remains too severe. The Accountant says that he looks forward to that escape. The Accountant then manifests a 1957 [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] and Milton drives them back into Hell.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as John Milton. He returns from [[Hell]] after ten years to save his granddaughter. He steals Satan's personal gun, the Godkiller, to delay the Accountant. He does not mind the pain that he suffers in Hell, but finds being forced to watch the video feed of his daughter's murder to be intolerable.<ref>{{cite web |first=Katey |last=Rich |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nic-Cage-Will-Drive-Angry-At-Summit-16195.html |title=Nic Cage Will Drive Angry At Summit |publisher=[[Cinema Blend]] |date=December 17, 2009 |access-date=October 26, 2010 |archive-date=November 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191130215809/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nic-Cage-Will-Drive-Angry-At-Summit-16195.html |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Piper Lee.
