The film was based on the book by Reine-Marie Paris, granddaughter of Camille's brother, the poet and diplomat [[Paul Claudel]]. It was directed by [[Bruno Nuytten]], co-produced by [[Isabelle Adjani]], and starred her and [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]]. The film had a total of 2,717,136 admissions in France.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\"/> Adjani was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role, the second in her career.\n\n==Premise==\nThe film recounts the troubled life of French sculptor Camille Claudel and her long relationship with the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. Beginning in the 1880s, with the young Claudel's first meeting with Rodin, the film traces the development of their intense romantic bond. The growth of this relationship coincides with the rise of Claudel's career, helping her overcome prejudices against female artists. However, their romance soon sours, due to the increasing pressures of Rodin's fame and his love for another woman. These difficulties combine with her increasing doubts about the value of her work and drive Claudel into an emotional tumult that threatens to become insanity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Isabelle Adjani]] as [[Camille Claudel]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Auguste Rodin]]\n* Laurent Gr\u00e9vill as [[Paul Claudel]]\n* [[Alain Cuny]] as Louis-Prosper Claudel\n* [[Madeleine Robinson]] as Louise-Athana\u00efse Claudel\n* Philippe Cl\u00e9venot as Eug\u00e8ne Blot\n* [[Katrine Boorman]] as [[Jessie Lipscomb]]\n* [[Maxime Leroux]] as [[Claude Debussy]]\n* [[Dani\u00e8le Lebrun]] as [[Rose Beuret]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Doctor Michaux\n\n==Awards==\n* 1989 \u2013 nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]<ref name=\"Oscars1990\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990 |title=The 62nd Academy Awards (1990) Nominees and Winners |access-date=6 September 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n** [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]\n** [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* 1989 \u2013 received five [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s, including the [[C\u00e9sar Awards]] for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n* 1989 \u2013 Isabelle Adjani received the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/03_preistr_ger_1989/03_Preistraeger_1989.html |title=Berlinale: 1989 Prize Winners |access-date=2011-03-10 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=September 2022}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an aggregated score of 100% based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Camille Claudel |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/camille_claudel |url-status=live |access-date=September 1, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Camille Claudel 1915]]'', 2013 film\n* ''[[Rodin (film)|Rodin]]'', 2017 film\n* [[List of submissions to the 62nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[Mental illness in films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0094828|Camille Claudel}}\n* {{Mojo title|camilleclaudel}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|camille_claudel|Camille Claudel}}\n\n{{1980s-France-film-stub}}\n\n{{Camille Claudel}}\n{{Auguste Rodin}}\n{{C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film}}\n{{French submission for Academy Awards}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Best Film C\u00e9sar Award winners]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about sculptors]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Auguste Rodin]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Camille Claudel]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruno Nuytten]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Gabriel Yared]]\n[[Category:French biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Gaumont Film Company films]]\n[[Category:1980s French films]]"}]}}}}
