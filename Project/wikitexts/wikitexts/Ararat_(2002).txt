It is about a family and film crew in Toronto working on [[Story within a story|a film]] based loosely on the [[Defense of Van (1915)|1915 defense of Van]] during the [[Armenian genocide]]. In addition to exploring the human impact of that specific historical event, ''Ararat'' examines the nature of truth and its representation through art. The [[Armenian genocide denial|genocide is disputed]] by the [[Government of Turkey]], an issue that partially inspired and is explored in the film.\n\nThe film was featured out of competition at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]. It won five awards at the [[23rd Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Toronto]], an [[Armenian Canadian]] family is headed by Ani, a widow whose husband attempted to assassinate a Turkish ambassador. Her adult son Raffi is involved in a sexual affair with Celia, his step-sister, who has accused Ani of pushing her father off of a cliff, while Ani insists he slipped and fell. Ani gives [[art history]] presentations on Armenian American painter [[Arshile Gorky]], with Celia constantly attending and publicly heckling Ani about concealing the truth.\n\nAn Armenian film director, Edward Saroyan, arrives to Toronto with a goal to make a film about the Armenian genocide, the [[Defense of Van (1915)|Van Resistance]], and Gorky. Ani is hired as a historical consultant, with Raffi working on the project with his mother. An aspiring [[Turkish Canadian]] actor named Ali receives his big break when cast as Ottoman governor [[Jevdet Bey]]. Ali reads on the history of the genocide, which he had never heard much of before, and offends Raffi when he tells Saroyan that he believes the Ottomans felt the genocide was justified, in light of [[World War I]]. Raffi attempts to explain to Ali that the Armenians were citizens of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and that the Turks were not at war with them. Ali shrugs the encounter off, saying they were both born in Canada and they should together try to move past the genocide.\n\nAfter Raffi returns to Canada from a flight to Turkey, he is interrogated at [[airport security]] by a retiring customs official named David, who has reason to believe Raffi is involved in a plot to smuggle drugs. Rather than employ drug-sniffing dogs, David prefers to speak to Raffi at length, with Raffi claiming he had taken it upon himself to shoot extra footage in Turkey. In fact, the film is premiering that night. Inspired by his own son, David chooses to believe Raffi is innocent, and releases him. The film reels remain with him, however, which David discovers to contain [[heroin]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Charles Aznavour Cannes.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Charles Aznavour]] stars as Edward Saroyan]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charles Aznavour]] as Edward Saroyan\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as David\n* [[David Alpay]] as Raffi\n* [[Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian]] as Ani\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Rouben\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Celia\n* [[Brent Carver]] as Philip\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Martin Harcourt, the actor playing [[Clarence Ussher]]\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Ali, the actor playing [[Jevdet Bey]]\n* Lousnak as Shoushan, mother of Arshile Gorky\n* [[Simon Abkarian]] as [[Arshile Gorky]]\n** [[Garen Boyajian]] as young Arshile Gorky\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = Historic painter [[Arshile Gorky]], played by [[Simon Abkarian]], is significant in the film's themes.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Archives of American Art - Arshile Gorky - 3044.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Simon Abkarian (1997).jpg\n | width2    = 108\n | alt2      = \n}}\nIssues explored in the film include truth and art.
