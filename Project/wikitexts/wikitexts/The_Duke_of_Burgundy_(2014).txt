Evelyn is romantically involved with Cynthia and works as a maid in her home, where she is subject to strict behavioural expectations and high standards of cleanliness. When Evelyn does not complete tasks to Cynthia's satisfaction, she is punished.\n\nAs Cynthia increasingly falters in her [[BDSM|dominance]], it becomes apparent that Evelyn is orchestrating Cynthia's role in the relationship by writing instructions and scripts for specific scenes, which the couple acts out in the same way each day. While Evelyn finds the scenes to be sexually exciting, Cynthia only acts them out to sate her lover. She attempts to please Evelyn by ordering a carpenter to construct a bed with a drawer underneath for Evelyn to sleep in as a punishment; however, Evelyn is unhappy with the length of time it will take to produce the bed, and ultimately refuses the gift.\n\nEvelyn begins to demand that Cynthia lock her in a trunk in the evening as a new punishment. Cynthia agrees, but she is resentful about the new physical separation. Cynthia also becomes self-conscious about her ageing, having injured her back moving the trunk to her bedside. She expresses her unhappiness on Evelyn's birthday, when she demands that Evelyn bake her own birthday cake, which Cynthia eats while reclining with her feet resting on Evelyn's face. Evelyn does not enjoy the scene and calls out her safeword, ''[[Sphinx pinastri|pinastri]]'', which Cynthia ignores.\n\nThe couple's relationship becomes more strained as Evelyn's expectations go unfulfilled. Finally, Cynthia accuses Evelyn of polishing another lecturer's boots, which she considers to be an act of betrayal. The two eventually seem to make up, and Evelyn agrees to put less emphasis on her sexual needs. The film ends with the couple going through the same play routine seen at the film's start.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Cynthia  \n* [[Chiara D'Anna]] as Evelyn \n* [[Monica Swinn]] as Lorna \n* [[Eugenia Caruso]] as Dr. Fraxini \n* [[Fatma Mohamed]] as The Carpenter  \n* Kata Bartsch as Dr. Lurida   \n* Eszter Tompa as Dr. Viridana \n* Zita Kraszk\u00f3 as Dr. Schuller\n\n==Title==\nAs [[lepidopterology]] (the study of moths and butterflies) is a theme throughout the film, the title refers to the Duke of Burgundy (''[[Hamearis lucina]]'') butterfly, although it is no longer known \"how [it] received that name in the first place, any reasoning being lost in the mists of entomological antiquity.\"<ref>\nMatthew Oates, ''In Pursuit of Butterflies: A Fifty-year Affair'' (New York: Bloomsbury, 2015), https://books.google.com/books?id=X8QJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT41&dq=%22any+reasoning+being+lost+in+the+mists%22+duke+burgundy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-lND525PMAhUEOT4KHVUgA5sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22any%20reasoning%20being%20lost%20in%20the%20mists%22%20duke%20burgundy&f=false</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.
