Young (film director)|Robert M. Young]] and starring [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The screenplay was inspired by true events, the same as the older [[Slovakia|Slovak]] film ''[[The Boxer and Death]]'' directed by [[Peter Solan (director)|Peter Solan]]. The majority of the film is set in the German POW camp at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau#The extermination camp: Auschwitz II .28Birkenau.29|Auschwitz]] during the [[Holocaust]] and details how the [[Jewish Greeks|Jewish Greek]] [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Salamo Arouch]] was forced to fight other internees to the death for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards' entertainment. \n\n==Plot==\nA [[stevedore]] in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], [[Salamo Arouch]]'s passion is boxing. Captured along with his family and fianc\u00e9e Allegra in 1943 and interned in Auschwitz, Arouch is used by his SS captors as entertainment, forced to box against fellow prisoners. He knows that if he refuses, his family will be punished; if he wins, he will be given extra rations which he can share with them; if he loses, he will be sent to the [[gas chamber]]. As his family and friends die around him, he has only his love of Allegra and his grim determination to keep her alive.\n\nThe film follows the early life story of Salamo Arouch, though it takes some artistic liberties including the early introduction of wife Allegra (a pseudonym for Marta Yechiel), whom Arouch did not actually meet until after the liberation of the camp.<ref name=NYT/><ref name=People>{{cite journal | title = Boxer Salamo Arouch's Death Camp Bouts End in a Triumph of the Spirit | journal = People Magazine | volume = 33 |issue = 7 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116862,00.html | last = Schindehette | first = Susan |author2=Jack Kelley |author3=Mira Avrech  | date = 1990-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-11-22}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Salamo Arouch]]\n*[[Edward James Olmos]] as Gypsy\n*[[Robert Loggia]] as Poppa Around \n*Wendy Gazelle as Allegra\n*Kelly Wolf as Elena\n*[[Costas Mandylor]] as Avram\n*[[Kario Salem]] as Jacko\n*[[Edward Zentara]] as Janush\n*[[Hartmut Becker]] as Maj.
