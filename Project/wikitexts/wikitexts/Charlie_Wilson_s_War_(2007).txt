[[Tom Hanks]], [[Julia Roberts]], and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] starred, with [[Amy Adams]] and [[Ned Beatty]] in supporting roles. It was nominated for five [[65th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], but did not win in any category. Hoffman was nominated for an [[81st Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nIn 1980, Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] is more interested in partying than legislating, frequently throwing huge galas and staffing his congressional office with attractive young women. His social life eventually brings about a federal investigation into allegations of his cocaine use, conducted by federal prosecutor [[Rudy Giuliani]] as part of a larger investigation into congressional misconduct. The investigation results in no charge against Wilson.\n\nA friend and romantic interest, [[Joanne Herring]], encourages Charlie to do more to help the [[Pashtun people|Afghan people]], and persuades him to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the [[Soviet Union]], and they insist that Wilson visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. The Congressman is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Wilson returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.\n\nAs part of this effort, Charlie befriends maverick CIA operative [[Gust Avrakotos]] and his understaffed Afghanistan group to find a better strategy, especially including a means to counter the Soviets' formidable [[Mi-24|Mil Mi-24 Hind]] helicopter gunship. This group was composed in part of members of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]], including a young paramilitary officer named [[Michael G. Vickers|Michael Vickers]]. As a result, Charlie's deft political bargaining for the necessary funding and Avrakotos' careful planning using those resources, such as supplying the guerrillas with [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missile launchers, turns the Soviet occupation into a deadly quagmire with their heavy fighting vehicles being destroyed at a crippling rate. Charlie enlists the support of [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] for Soviet weapons and consumables, and [[Pakistan]] for distribution of arms.  The CIA's anti-communism budget evolves from $5 million to over $500 million (with the same amount matched by [[Saudi Arabia]]), startling several congressmen. This effort by Charlie ultimately evolves into a major portion of the U.S. foreign policy known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], under which the U.S. expanded assistance beyond just the mujahideen and began also supporting other anti-communist resistance movements around the world. Charlie states that senior Pentagon official [[Michael Pillsbury]] persuaded President [[Ronald Reagan]] to provide the Stingers to the Afghans.\n\nGust vehemently advises Charlie to seek support for post-Soviet occupation Afghanistan, referencing the \"zen master's\" story of [[The old man lost his horse|the lost horse]]. He also emphasizes that rehabilitating schools in the country will help educate young children before they are influenced by the \"[[Taliban|crazies]]\". Charlie attempts to appeal this with the government but finds no enthusiasm for even the modest measures he proposes. In the end, Charlie receives a major commendation for his support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of the [[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]] his secret efforts could yield in the future and the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Congressman|Representative]] [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Joanne Herring]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[Gust Avrakotos]]\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Bonnie Bach\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as [[Congressman|Representative]] [[Clarence Long|Doc Long]]\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as [[Michael G.
