A tornado throws swarms of sharks onto the boat, killing all aboard.\n\nThe cyclone soon hits Los Angeles, flooding the city with shark-infested seawater. Bar owner and surfer Fin sets out with his friends, Baz, Nova, and George, to rescue his estranged wife, April, and their teenage daughter, Claudia, after the bar and boardwalk are destroyed by the flooding. While heading to April's home, the group stops on a freeway to save people as flooding causes sharks to attack. George is killed and the group learns of a tornado warning. They arrive at April's house just before the first floor is flooded and shark-infested. Collin, April's boyfriend, is eaten by sharks, but the rest of the group escapes unharmed from the house, which gets hit by a huge wave causing it to collapse.\n\nAs they travel, the group comes across a school bus trapped in the floodwaters and surrounded by sharks. Fin stops to save the children and bus driver by rappelling down to the bus from a bridge. Afterward, the bus driver is killed by a letter in the [[Hollywood Sign]]. While Nova is driving the car, a shark lands on top of the car and rips the roof off. Fin's hand is cut and the group abandons the car before it explodes. They steal another car and meet up with Fin and April's son Matt, who is found taking shelter at his flight school. Three tornadoes develop and absorb the floodwater, turning into shark-filled \"sharknados\". The group borrow equipment from nearby storage and Matt and Nova become attracted to each other. Matt and Nova decide to stop the threat of the incoming sharknados by tossing bombs into them from a helicopter. Two are destroyed, but they are unable to stop the third one.\n\nAs Nova fights off a shark that had latched onto the helicopter, she falls out of the helicopter and directly into another shark's mouth. Matt is heartbroken. Baz is also lost in the storm along with Matt's friends Bobby and Luellyn. Ultimately, Fin destroys the last sharknado with a bomb attached to his car and the sharks begin to plummet toward the ground. One falling shark flies directly toward the remaining members of the group. Fin jumps into its mouth with a chainsaw and cuts his way out. He emerges carrying an unconscious but otherwise unharmed Nova. Matt is reunited with Nova, and Fin gets back together with April.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/07/12/201438989/sharknado-dares-to-ask-is-it-going-to-rain-giant-man-eating-sharks|title='Sharknado' Dares To Ask: Is It Going To Rain Giant Man-Eating Sharks?|last=Holmes|first=Linda|publisher=NPR|date=July 12, 2012|access-date=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ian Ziering]] as [[Fin Shepard|Fin \"Finley\" Shepard]], an ex-surfer who owns a bar.\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as George, a drunk man who spends all his time at Fin\u2019s bar.\n* [[Tara Reid]] as April Wexler, Fin's former wife.\n* [[Cassie Scerbo]] as Nova Clarke, a barmaid who works for Fin.\n* [[Jaason Simmons]] as Baz Hogan, Fin's right-hand man.\n* [[Aubrey Peeples]] as Claudia, April and Fin's daughter who feels left out.\n* [[Chuck Hittinger]] as Matt, Fin and April's son in flight school.\n* Christopher Wolfe as Collin, April's boyfriend.\n* [[Robbie Rist]] as Robbie, a bus driver.\n* Eileen Anderson, Frankie Mellor, Hannah Johnson, Ryan Ainsley and Timo de Jong as school kids on the bus.\n* Alex Arleo as Bobby, one of Matt's friends in flight school.\n* [[Connor Weil]] as Luellyn, one of Matt's friends in flight school.\n* [[Julie McCullough]] as Jonni Waves, a news reporter.\n* [[Adrian Bustamante]] as Kelso, a lifeguard.\n* Israel S\u00e1ez de Miguel as Captain Carlos Santiago, a fishing boat captain.\n* Marcus Choi as Palmer, a businessman attempting to make a shady deal with Captain Santiago.\n\n== Production ==\n''Sharknado'' was directed for film studio [[The Asylum]] by [[Anthony C.
