After he leaves a [[greasy spoon]] diner without paying, a wildly dressed woman with a brunette [[Bob cut|bob]] who calls herself Lulu confronts him. Lulu offers Charlie a ride [[Lower Manhattan|downtown]] but instead heads for New Jersey and throws his [[Pager|beeper]] from the moving car. Lulu openly drinks liquor while driving and stops in a town to buy more. While Charlie phones his office, Lulu &mdash; unbeknownst to him &mdash; robs a liquor store.\n\nCharlie claims the cash he is carrying is for his [[Christmas club]] account, but Lulu persuades him to pay for a room at a roadside motel. Once inside she handcuffs him to the bed. She phones his boss and puts the receiver to his head while they are having sex, forcing him into an awkward conversation. Later Charlie pretends to phone his wife but Lulu is unaware that his marriage ended nine months ago.\n\nAfter sharing a meal with Lulu at an Italian restaurant, Charlie realizes he is unable to pay with what little cash he has left. Lulu leaves him with the check, forcing him to flee the restaurant to escape an angry chef who demands payment. After spending the night at a motel, Lulu and Charlie awaken to find a police officer and tow truck near the car she drove down an embankment and into a signpost the night before. Lulu abandons the car and buys one from a sleazy used car dealer, leaving Charlie wondering where she got the money. He starts to enjoy Lulu's free-wheeling lifestyle and realizes he is falling in love with her.\n\nLulu confesses that her real name is Audrey and introduces Charlie as her husband to her mother, Peaches, at her Pennsylvania home. She appears as a demure blonde, having removed her brunette wig. She takes Charlie to her high school reunion, where a former classmate recognizes him as his office colleague. Audrey's violent ex-convict husband, Ray Sinclair, also appears and makes clear that he wants her back. After ditching his date, Ray takes Audrey and Charlie along while he robs a convenience store. He [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whips]] a clerk and intentionally breaks Charlie's nose. They drive to a cheap motel, where Ray forces Charlie to admit his wife left him (having learned this from Charlie's colleague at the class reunion). Realizing Charlie has deceived her, Audrey stays behind with Ray.\n\nDespite Ray warning him to stay away from him and Audrey, Charlie secretly tails the couple as they leave the motel. Charlie confronts Ray in a Virginia restaurant with several police officers seated nearby and threatens to reveal Ray's parole violations unless he allows Audrey to leave with him. He demands that Ray hand over his wallet and car keys and leaves the check with Ray to force him to stay behind as they flee. Ray is saved from this dilemma by a shop girl he had met earlier.\n\nCharlie takes Audrey to his [[Stony Brook, Long Island]] home, but their idyllic suburban retreat is literally shattered when Ray hurls a patio chair through their sliding glass door. He severely beats Charlie and handcuffs him to the pipes under the bathroom sink before attacking Audrey. Charlie frees himself by pulling the pipes apart and strangles Ray with the handcuffs. During the scuffle, Charlie retrieves Ray's dropped knife. Ray dies when he accidentally impales himself on the knife Charlie is holding. Audrey is taken away for questioning when the police arrive.\n\nCharlie later quits his job and looks for Audrey at her apartment, but finds she has moved. Outside the diner where Charlie met Audrey, a waitress accuses him of leaving without paying. Audrey suddenly appears with the cash he left on the table in her hand. She invites Charlie into her [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie station wagon]] and back into her life.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Charles Driggs\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Audrey Hankel, aka Lulu\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Ray Sinclair\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Irene\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as The Country Squire\n* Dana Preu as \"Peaches\"\n* [[Jack Gilpin]] as Larry Dillman\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as the irate chef\n* [[Robert Ridgely]] as Richard Graves\n* [[Sister Carol]] as \"Dottie\"\n* [[The Feelies]] as The Willies\n* Kristin Olsen as Tracy\n* [[John Sayles]] as the motorcycle cop\n* [[Stop Making Sense|Steve Scales]] as \"Nelson\"\n* The Texas Kid as the hitchhiking cowboy\n* [[Suburban Lawns|Su Tissue]] as Peggy Dillman\n* [[John Waters]] as the used car salesman\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Something Wild'' was acclaimed by critics.

Demme is a master of finding the bizarre in the ordinary. The accomplishment of Demme and the writer, E. Max Frye, is to think their characters through before the very first scene. They know all about Charlie and Lulu, and so what happens after the meeting outside that restaurant is almost inevitable, given who they are and how they look at each other. This is one of those rare movies where the plot seems surprised at what the characters do.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Something Wild|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=November 7, 1986|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/something-wild-1986|accessdate=June 28, 2022}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' film critic [[Dave Kehr]] gave the film a perfect four star review, stating \"It's not every day that someone goes [[Alfred Hitchcock]] one better, but in ''Something Wild,'' Jonathan Demme has done it.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Kehr|title=Something Wild|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 7, 1986|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-11-07-8603230768-story.html|accessdate=June 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Something Wild'' was released on [[VHS]] by [[HBO|HBO Video]] on July 15, 1987.
