With no news of his father and refusing to live with his legal guardians, Ren flees into the streets of [[Shibuya]]. Ren steals some food and sleeps in an alley, reminiscing the aftermath of his mother's funeral.\n\nIn the Beast Kingdom, the grandmaster has decided he will retire in order to reincarnate as a deity and names two potential successors: the popular I\u014dzen, who is also the father of two children, and the powerful Kumatetsu, who is lonely and lazy. The Grandmaster suggests that Kumatetsu find a disciple in hopes of inspiring him to succeed him.\n\nWhile wandering the streets of [[Tokyo]] with his makeshift companion, Tatara, Kumatetsu meets Ren and suggests that the boy becomes his disciple. Though Ren is fiercely opposed, he follows Kumatetsu back to the Beast Kingdom out of curiosity but is unable to go back to the human world. As he watches a battle between I\u014dzen and Kumatetsu, Ren is impressed with Kumatetsu's persistence despite the lack of support from onlookers. When Ren cheers for him, Kumatetsu is easily defeated. However, the Grandmaster declares the actual duel of succession has not come yet.\n\nTaking Ren as a disciple, Kumatetsu gives him a new name, Ky\u016bta. Their initial training sessions go poorly, but Ky\u016bta realizes that he can learn from Kumatetsu by imitating him while performing his household chores. The boy gradually discovers that he can predict his master's movements, and can dodge and move adeptly in combat. They soon begin training together. After eight years, the teenage Ky\u016bta has become a distinguished [[kendo]] practitioner. Moreover, through his relationship with Ky\u016bta, Kumatetsu gains his own following of supporters, including the younger son of I\u014dzen, Jir\u014dmaru, who wishes to be trained by Kumatetsu.\n\nKy\u016bta finds a way back to the human world, and befriends Kaede, a young student. In the process, Ky\u016bta finds his father, who had been searching for Ren since he disappeared and wants to catch up. Torn by his double life, he is unable to reconcile the resentment he had as Ren and the lack of connections he has as Ky\u016bta. When he rejects both his father and Kumatetsu, he discovers a powerful void within himself that nearly overwhelms him, until Kaede gets him to calm down and gives him a bracelet that has helped her when she becomes anxious.\n\nOn the day of the succession duel, Kumatetsu loses confidence without Ky\u016bta's encouragement and is nearly subdued by I\u014dzen. However, Ky\u016bta has been secretly watching and reveals himself, helping Kumatetsu defeat I\u014dzen. When Kumatetsu is declared the winner and the new lord, I\u014dzen's elder son Ichir\u014dhiko is revealed to be a human who had been found on the streets of Tokyo as an infant and adopted by I\u014dzen. Having developed a vacuum in his heart like Ky\u016bta, unwilling to believe that he is a human and not a beast, Ichir\u014dhiko manifests telekinetic powers and seriously injures Kumatetsu with I\u014dzen's sword. Ky\u016bta is nearly overtaken by his own emptiness and tries to kill Ichir\u014dhiko, but regains his senses with Kaede's bracelet as Ichir\u014dhiko is consumed by darkness and disappears.\n\nKy\u016bta decides to leave for the human world to fight Ichir\u014dhiko. When Kaede refuses to leave him, they are attacked by Ichir\u014dhiko, who takes the form of a destructive whale. Unable to hold his own against Ichir\u014dhiko, the young man decides to use the vacuum within himself to absorb his opponent's negative energy and then kill himself, saving everyone else. However, Kumatetsu uses his new privilege as the lord and reincarnates as a deity, taking the form of a sword \"to be handled with the heart\" in reference to their first training session together. He merges with his pupil's form, filling his empty void within him. Together, the two manage to defeat Ichir\u014dhiko without killing him. Ichir\u014dhiko wakes up surrounded by his adoptive family. Meanwhile; back in Shibuya, Ren is talking to Kumatetsu (who now resides inside him) and the two have a heartfelt moment together, with Kumatetsu promising to always be there for Ren and threatening to beat him up from the inside if he wavers again.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ren celebrates his victory with Kaede in the Beast Kingdom and returns to the human world. After reconciling with his father and himself, Ren decides to live once again in the human world with Kumatetsu forever residing in his heart.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Character <br /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-04-12/koji-yakusho-aoi-miyazaki-shota-sometani-star-in-hosoda-the-boy-and-the-beast-film/.87071|title=K\u014dji Yakusho, Aoi Miyazaki, Sh\u014dta Sometani Star in Hosoda's The Boy and the Beast Film|publisher=Anime News Network|date=April 12, 2015|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eiga.com/news/20150413/2/|script-title=ja:\u7d30\u7530\u5b88\u76e3\u7763\u300c\u30d0\u30b1\u30e2\u30ce\u306e\u5b50\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u5f79\u6240\u5e83\u53f8\u3001\u5bae\u5d0e\u3042\u304a\u3044\u3001\u67d3\u8c37\u5c06\u592a\u3089\u8c6a\u83ef\u4ff3\u512a\u9663\u305a\u3089\u308a\uff01|publisher=eiga.com|language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eiga.com/news/20150413/3/|script-title=ja:\u5e83\u702c\u3059\u305a\u300c\u30d0\u30b1\u30e2\u30ce\u306e\u5b50\u300d\u30d2\u30ed\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u58f0\u512a\u521d\u6311\u6226\uff01\u7d30\u7530\u5b88\u76e3\u7763\u304c\u7d76\u8cdb\u300c\u51c4\u3044\u624d\u80fd\u300d|publisher=eiga.com|language=ja}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakemono-no-ko.jp/news/index.html|title = \u300c\u30d0\u30b1\u30e2\u30ce\u306e\u5b50\u300d\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8}}</ref>\n! colspan=2|Cast\n|-\n!
