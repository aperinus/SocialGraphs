The film's story is told in a linear fashion, alternating through a series of single-location vignettes connected by theme but with characters representing different archetypes.<!--if needed, <ref name=\"KladyYoung\"/> --> In each vignette, the characters try to have an evening of uncomplicated sex but are unable to separate sex from love.\n\nGero and Abrams began the development of the film in 2004, and wrote the screenplay for six months in 2005. Filming was done in Toronto over 19 days. The film, which contains scenes of simulated sex but no pornographic material,<!-- if needed, <ref name=\"TakeuchiYoung\"/> --> was at the centre of the [[Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006|Bill C-10]] controversy that brought considerable publicity to the low-budget production, allowing it to have a relatively wide release in Canada for an independent film.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF). The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was recognized with multiple awards, including a near-sweep of the film categories at the [[10th Canadian Comedy Awards|Canadian Comedy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Young People Fucking'' intertwines the stories of four couples and one [[threesome]] as they have one sexual encounter each, which are divided into chapters: prelude, foreplay, sex, interlude, orgasm and afterglow. Each couple represents a specific relationship archetype. The first of the five is called ''The Best Friends'' because the characters, Matt and Kristen, decide to become [[Casual sex|friends with benefits]]. Their 20-year friendship initially makes this awkward because they know everything about each other&nbsp;\u2013 except that they each secretly knew the other once had romantic feelings for them. These feelings are rediscovered and acknowledged as they become intimate.\n\nThe second archetype, ''The Couple'', is about Abby and Andrew, a couple in a long-term relationship who are having trouble enlivening their love life. On Andrew's birthday they try something new, a [[strap-on dildo]] that Abby received as a joke gift at a bachelorette party. Through [[role reversal]], they find satisfaction, and a new understanding and appreciation for each other.\n\nThe third archetype is labeled ''The Exes''.  Mia and Eric, whose relationship [[breakup|broke up]] some time ago, have dinner and return to Mia's residence. They decide to have sex and although they say they are over each other, they clearly have feelings. They regret that their sexual encounter is not enough to overcome the unstated reasons they separated.\n\nIn the fourth archetype, ''The First Date'', [[womanizing]] Ken returns to the apartment of Jamie, a flirtatious new employee at his workplace, where he has had sex with every other woman. Ken feels a connection and worries about ruining a possible relationship, resulting in awkward sex. Unsatisfied, Jamie admits to pretending to be an ''[[ing\u00e9nue]]'' to appeal to Ken, and calls him a hypocrite when he complains that she lied to have sex. Ken is upset as he leaves but he quickly turns his charm on a woman in the elevator.\n\nIn the fifth and final archetype, ''The Roommates'', Gord invites his roommate Dave to have sex with his girlfriend Inez. Gord initially demands affirmation and directs them while watching. Dave later prompts Gord to admit he is insecure about his adequacy for Inez, who is enthusiastically permissive and will happily do anything Gord wants. In this moment of honesty, Dave quietly admits to having a [[Shoe fetishism|shoe fetish]] that has made forming a relationship difficult but Gord and Inez do not seem to hear. Dave and Gord find respect for each other and reaffirm their friendship. Inez suggests she'd like to watch Gord and Dave have sex together.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Robin Wong TIFF Schmooze the cast of Young People Fucking.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Members of the cast at an eTalk Schmooze event at TIFF (from left: Lisinska, Abrams, Pope)]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Aaron Abrams]] as Matt\n* [[Carly Pope]] as Kristen\n* [[Kristin Booth]] as Abby\n* [[Josh Dean (actor)|Josh Dean]] as Andrew\n* [[Sonja Bennett]] as Mia\n* [[Josh Cooke]] as Eric\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Jamie/Dora\n* [[Callum Blue]] as Ken\n* [[Ennis Esmer]] as Gord\n* [[Peter Oldring]] as Dave\n* [[Natalie Lisinska]] as Inez\n}}\nAbrams, co-writer of the project, said he wrote most of the male parts for himself with the intention of taking whichever role they had difficulty casting. He has known Esmer since grade&nbsp;7 and had him in mind to play Gord. Abrams knew Oldring from comedy clubs.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n<!--\nBaird had previously modelled for ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]''<ref>[http://www.askmen.com/women/models_300/320_diora_baird.html Model of the Week]</ref> and had appeared nude in film, but declined to do so as Jamie. This caused outrage from some fans of her nude work.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n-->\n\n==Writing and development==\n\nWriters Martin Gero and Aaron Abrams had the idea for ''Young People Fucking'' around 2004.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/> Gero thought most romantic comedies built to the point of intimacy while sex comedies tended to be about \"losing your virginity or masturbating\", and that there were no films dealing with \"the complications of sex\" and the resulting humour.<ref name=\"TakeuchiYoung\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|Our generation makes an effort to separate love and sex. They're all trying to do this thing, and they're all failing miserably&nbsp;... We're saying, \"Listen, people our age.

They intended it to be a short film because they did not think they could get a deal to make a feature-length film.  Halfway through writing, they realized it was an \"actor's movie\" that would rely on its performances.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\nThe film's title was a working title that stuck. According to Gero, \"we wanted to be frank and honest and uncensored\". Gero said he and Abrams, as male writers, were initially most concerned about the depth of the female characters and that in their first draft, the male characters were comparatively underdeveloped.<ref name=\"TakeuchiYoung\"/> Their first notes on the female characters came from actor [[Sarah Polley]], who Abrams knew from ''[[Slings & Arrows]]''.<ref name=\"StraussComedy\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\nIn November 2007, three weeks prior to filming, the project's distribution deal collapsed when [[ThinkFilm]] was sold to American investors.  Producer [[Steve Hoban]] moved quickly to secure a new Canadian distributor and investor that would accept the project without a cast, director or script change.  On the strength of the script, Montreal-based distributor [[Christal Films]] signed up; it saw the film as a way of expanding its reach into [[English Canada]]. ThinkFilm retained US and international distribution.<ref name=\"StraussComedy\"/>\n\n''Young People Fucking'' was filmed in Toronto over 19 days<ref name=\"StraussComedy\"/> and cost $1.4&nbsp;million. It received $200,000 in federal and provincial tax credits,<ref name=\"BenziePremier\"/><ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/> and [[Telefilm Canada]] had a 30% stake in the film.<ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/> Labour costs were about $1&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/> The crew were mostly hired from a children's show, where they were accustomed to working with sensitive performers.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\n$160,000 was spent securing rights for the music used, though because of the film's title, the filmmakers had difficulty finding music that suited the scenes and then gaining the necessary permissions. They could not get permission to show any recognizable products, including brand-name condoms. During filming, the film was called \"Young People\" because the location manager did not think he could negotiate permissions under its full title.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\nThere were few technical shots in the film because of the tight filming schedule and because Gero wanted to avoid technical delays and the semi-dressed actors getting cold. The movie was shot on [[Film stock|film]] because it consists almost entirely of interior shots and tight spaces. Production designer Diana Abbatangelo created the warm scenes. After filming, the filmmakers spent 18 days with director of photography Arthur E. Cooper doing [[Color grading|colour correction]] to add \"richness and crispness\" to make it look like a high-production film.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\n''Young People Fucking'' was at the centre of a Canadian political controversy.<ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/>\nIn October 2007,<ref name=\"ParliamentBillC10\"/> the Canadian federal government introduced the 560-page [[Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006|Bill C-10]], which passed through the [[House of Commons of Canada|Commons]] unopposed. In February&nbsp;2008, news broke that it contained a clause allowing the government to retroactively strip tax credits from films the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage|Heritage Minister]] deemed \"contrary to public policy\". What that meant and how it might be applied was unclear, and it was followed by several months of investigation by the Senate Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee, with testimony from the arts community and religious activists.<ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/><ref name=\"CanadianHappy\"/>{{r|ParliamentBillC10|p=346}}<ref name=\"CreelmanDump\"/>\n\nWriter-director Gero stated: \"I think we're an easy target&nbsp;\u2013 we've got a swear in the title. And also no one's seen it. So it's easy for the pro-C-10 people, whoever they are, I've only met one, to say&nbsp;... this is obviously pornography, we want to shut it down\".<ref>CBC Radio \u2013 [http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/thehouse_20080531_6051.mp3 The House: Saturday, May 31, 2008] (mp3 podcast download) Time: 18:30\u201322:45 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172822/http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/thehouse_20080531_6051.mp3 |date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref> Gero and Abrams noted that the publicity worked in the film's favour and expected the bill would die when the film came out and audiences saw it was not objectionable.<ref name=\"TakeuchiYoung\"/>\n\nDistributor [[Maple Pictures]] invited senators, members of parliament and staffers to a special screening in [[Ottawa]] on May 29, 2008,<ref name=\"CreelmanTheatres\"/><ref name=\"CassiviCachez\"/><ref name=\"RevelerSnub\"/> but Conservative MPs declined to attend; Conservative aide Victoria van Eyk was fired when she ordered tickets for herself.<ref name=\"CreelmanTheatres\"/><ref name=\"RevelerSnub\"/> [[New Democratic Party]] heritage critic [[Bill Siksay]] found it \"troubling\" that the film was said to be undeserving of tax-credit support, saying, \"I think lots of people will have a good laugh when they see it\".<ref name=\"SmithCulture\"/> Liberal Heritage critic [[Denis Coderre]] rated the movie 3 out of 5 and said, \"My Canada includes freedom of expression, and I do not think politicians should get involved in creation\".<ref name=\"RevelerSnub\"/> Heritage Minister [[Jos\u00e9e Verner]] said she was privately opposed to the clause.<ref name=\"McCannMacleans\"/>\n\nBacklash to C-10 was strongest in [[Quebec]];<ref name=\"CanadianHappy\"/> however some amusement was taken at the prudish Conservative reaction to the film in English Canada.<ref name=\"TakeuchiYoung\"/> Marc Cassivi of ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' called it hypocritical and wrote that the film has merely \"le sex ontarien\" (literally, the Ontario sex) with no pornographic material, no genitals to be seen and breasts usually clad in brassieres.<ref name=\"CassiviCachez\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Young People Fucking'' premiered on September 6, 2007, at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF).
