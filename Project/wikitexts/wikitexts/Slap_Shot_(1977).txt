It depicts a minor league ice hockey team that resorts to [[fighting in ice hockey|violent play]] to gain popularity in a declining factory town.\n\nDowd based much of her script, as well as several of the characters, on her brother [[Ned Dowd]]'s playing experiences on 1970s minor league professional hockey teams.\n\nWhile ''Slap Shot'' received mixed reviews upon release and was only a moderate box office success, it has since become widely regarded as a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fictional small town of Charlestown, [[Pennsylvania]], the local [[steel mill]] is about to close permanently and lay off 10,000 workers, indirectly threatening the existence of the town's [[minor league]] hockey team, the Charlestown Chiefs, who are also struggling with a losing season and an increasingly hostile crowd. After discovering the hometown fans responding positively to an on-ice brawl with the opposing [[goalie]], [[player-coach]] Reggie Dunlop goads his own team into a violent style of play, eventually letting the overly-aggressive [[Hanson Brothers]], the club's recent acquisitions, loose on their opponents. The brothers' actively violent and thuggish style of play excites the fans, which increases revenue, potentially saving the team.\n\nThe team's new style produces unintended consequences that affect not only Dunlop, but the Chiefs' star player, Ned Braden, along with the rest of the team. Braden refuses to take part in the violent antics, as Dunlop attempts to exploit Braden's marital troubles in his efforts to get him to take part in the team's brawling, but to no avail. Several games degenerate into [[bench-clearing brawl]]s, including one that takes place before the opening face-off, and another that brings the local police into the locker room to arrest the Hanson Brothers after they attack the opposing fans in the stands. Nonetheless, the Chiefs rise up the ranks to become contenders for the championship, and a rumor (started by Dunlop himself to further motivate his teammates) spreads that the team's success could possibly lead them to be sold to a buyer in [[Florida]].\n\nEventually Dunlop meets team owner Anita McCambridge, and discovers his efforts to increase the team's popularity (and value) through violence have been for naught, as McCambridge's better option is to fold the team as a tax write-off. By the time Dunlop decides to abandon the new strategy of violence over skill, the Chiefs' main rivals in Syracuse have already upped the ante by stocking their team full of violent \"goons\" (many of whom were previously suspended from the league for flagrant violations) in preparation for the league's championship game. After being crushed during the first period while playing a non-violent style of \"old time hockey,\" the disgusted general manager tells them that various [[National Hockey League]] scouts accepted his invitation to the game, as he was hoping that the Chiefs' habitual escapades would get the players signed to the major leagues.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Dunlop decides to have his team revert to their previous violent approach, much to the joy of the spectators. When Braden witnesses his now-estranged wife cheering for the Chiefs, he realizes the absurdity of the violence, and adopts a similarly radical (but still non-violent) way of participation by performing a live striptease on the [[Ice rink|rink]] amidst rousing cheers. When the Syracuse team's captain protests against this \"obscene\" demonstration and hits the referee for dismissing him, Syracuse is disqualified, granting the Chiefs the championship. After their win, and with the Chiefs now effectively folded and finished, Dunlop accepts the offer to be the player-coach to the Minnesota Nighthawks, bringing his teammates with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Paul Newman]] \u2013 Reggie Dunlop (#7)\n* [[Strother Martin]] \u2013 Joe McGrath\n* [[Michael Ontkean]] \u2013 Ned Braden (#10)\n* [[Jennifer Warren]] \u2013 Francine Dunlop\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] \u2013 Lily Braden\n* [[Jerry Houser]] \u2013 Dave \"Killer\" Carlson (#3)\n* [[Jeff Carlson (ice hockey)|Jeff Carlson]] \u2013 [[Hanson Brothers|Jeff Hanson]] (#18)\n* [[Steve Carlson]] \u2013 [[Hanson Brothers|Steve Hanson]] (#17)\n* [[David Hanson (ice hockey)|David Hanson]] \u2013 [[Hanson Brothers|Jack Hanson]] (#16)\n* [[Yvon Barrette]] \u2013 Denis Lemieux (#1)\n* [[Allan F.

At that time, violence, especially in the low minors, was a selling point of the game.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nDowd was living in Los Angeles when she got a call from Ned, a member of the [[Johnstown Jets]] hockey team. He gave her the bad news that the team was for sale.<ref name=\"SI\">Sports Illustrated, July 2, 2007, p. 106</ref> Dowd moved to the area and was inspired to write ''Slap Shot''. It was filmed in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and in central [[New York State]] ([[Clinton Arena]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], [[Utica Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Utica, New York]] and the [[Onondaga County War Memorial|Onondaga County War Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]).\n\nNancy Dowd used Ned and a number of his Johnstown Jets teammates in ''Slap Shot'', with Ned playing Syracuse goon \"Ogie Ogilthorpe\". He later used the role to launch a career as a Hollywood character actor, an [[assistant director]] and eventually a [[line producer]]. The characters of the \"Hanson Brothers\" are based on three actual brothers: Jeff, Steve and [[Jack Carlson (ice hockey)|Jack Carlson]], who played with Ned Dowd on the Jets. The character of \"Dave 'Killer' Carlson\" is based on then-Jets player Dave \"Killer\" Hanson. Steve and Jeff Carlson played their Hanson brother counterparts in the film. Jack Carlson was originally scripted to appear in the film as the third brother, Jack, with [[David Hanson (ice hockey)|Dave Hanson]] playing his film counterpart, \"Dave 'Killer' Carlson.\" However, by the time filming began, Jack Carlson had been called up by the [[Edmonton Oilers]], then of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]], to play in the WHA playoffs, so Dave Hanson moved into the role of \"Jack Hanson,\" and [[Jerry Houser]] was hired for the role of \"'Killer' Carlson.\"\n\nPaul Newman, claiming that he swore very little in real life before the making of ''Slap Shot'', said to ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine in 1984: \n{{cquote|There's a hangover from characters sometimes. There are things that stick. Since ''Slap Shot'', my language is right out of the locker room!}}\nNewman stated that the most fun he ever had making a movie was on ''Slap Shot,'' as he had played the sport while young and was fascinated by the real players around him. During the last decades of his life, he repeatedly called Reg Dunlop one of his favorite roles.<ref>{{cite magazine\n |url          = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/why-slap-shot-is-the-perfect-1970s-sports-movie-w468651\n |title        = Why 'Slap Shot' Captures the 1970s Better Than Any Other Sports Movie\n |magazine         = [[Rolling Stone]]\n |last1        = Epstein\n |first1       = Dan\n |date         = 2017-02-24\n |access-date  = 2018-02-23\n |archive-date = February 23, 2018\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223232250/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/why-slap-shot-is-the-perfect-1970s-sports-movie-w468651\n |url-status   = live\n}}</ref> [[Al Pacino]] wanted to play the role of Reggie Dunlop (#7) but director George Roy Hill chose Paul Newman instead.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NglRYSqXxN8C&q=%22al+pacino%22+and+%22slap+shot%22&pg=PA93|title=Al Pacino|isbn=9781416948797|last1=Grobel|first1=Lawrence|date=December 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Production notes==\n[[File:Paul Newman and Roy Hill, RIT NandE 1976 Jul12 Complete.jpg|thumb|right|Actor Paul Newman and director George Roy Hill during production]]\nYvan Ponton and Yvon Barrette (who played forward Jean-Guy Drouin and goaltender Denis Lemieux, the two Quebec players in the film) dubbed their own voices for the film's translated French version. The film is one of few mainstream American films that was translated in colloquial [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French]] and not [[Standard French]]. Heavy use of Quebec expressions and [[Quebec French profanity|foul language]] has made this version of the film a cult classic among French-speaking Canadians, where lines from the movie such as \"Dave est magan\u00e9\" (\"Dave's a mess\") and \"Du hockey comme dans l'temps\" (\"good old-fashioned hockey\") are common catch phrases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lapresse.ca/vivre/urbania/201309/20/01-4691571-hubert-fielden-responsable-du-doublage-de-slap-shot.php|title=Hubert Fielden, responsable du doublage de Slap Shot|first=Andr\u00e9 P\u00e9loquin /|last=URBANIA|date=September 20, 2013|via=Cyberpresse|access-date=July 28, 2019|archive-date=April 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427221607/https://www.lapresse.ca/vivre/urbania/201309/20/01-4691571-hubert-fielden-responsable-du-doublage-de-slap-shot.php|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was filmed in (and loosely based around) [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and utilized several players from the then-active [[North American Hockey League (1973\u201377)|North American Hockey League]] Johnstown Jets (the team for which Dowd himself played) as extras.

Coincidentally, the Johnstown Jets and the NAHL folded in 1977, the year ''Slap Shot'' was released.\n\nAlthough much of the movie takes place during the fall and winter seasons, when hockey is in season, filming at the Utica Memorial Auditorium took place from June 3\u20134.

The next game in the series was held in Johnstown, and the Jets retaliated by attacking the Norsemen players during the warm-ups, with a huge brawl erupting.  The Norsemen players and coaches then returned to the dressing room and refused to come out to start the game.  The game was awarded to the Jets by forfeit, as was the playoff series since the \"win\" gave the Jets the needed number of victories to capture the series.<ref name=\"SI2\"/>\n\nAnother scene is also based on a real-life event. In the film Jeff Hanson scores a goal and is hit in the face by a set of keys thrown by a fan. The Hansons then go into the stands after the fan and Jeff Hanson punches out the wrong fan. After the game the Hansons are arrested for the incident. In real life a similar incident occurred in [[Utica, New York]], in a game between the Johnstown Jets and the [[Mohawk Valley Comets]].<ref name=\"SI2\"/> Jeff Carlson was hit in the face by a cup of ice thrown by a Utica fan and went into the stands after the fan with brothers Jack and Steve.
