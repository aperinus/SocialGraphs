Based on the 2001 novel ''[[The Dark Fields]]'' by [[Alan Glynn]], the film stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Andrew Howard]], and [[Anna Friel]]. The film follows Edward Morra, a struggling writer who is introduced to a [[nootropic]] drug called NZT-48, which gives him the ability to use his brain fully and to improve his lifestyle vastly.\n''Limitless'' was released on March 18, 2011, and became a box-office success, grossing over $161 million on a budget of $27 million. A [[Limitless (TV series)|television series of the same name]], covering events that take place after the film, debuted on September 22, 2015, but was cancelled after one season.\n\n== Plot ==\nEddie Morra is a struggling author in New York City. His girlfriend Lindy, frustrated with his lack of progress (as well as his seeming lack of ambition, motivation, and focus), breaks up with him. Eddie encounters Vernon, the brother of his ex-wife Melissa, who gives him a sample of a new [[nootropic]] called NZT-48, which Vernon implies will help Eddie with his \"creative problems\". On the drug, Eddie discovers that he has acquired [[Eidetic memory|perfect recall]], and is able to analyze minute details and information at incredible speed. As the pill takes effect, he is being yelled at by his landlord's wife. With his new power, he calms her down, helps her with her law school homework, and sleeps with her. His abilities compel him to tidy up his apartment and give him immense inspiration for his book.\n\nSoon afterwards, Vernon is murdered by someone searching for the drug. Eddie locates Vernon's supply and takes increasing doses. As his life improves, he decides to begin investing in the stock market. He is hired at a brokerage firm and resumes his relationship with Lindy. His success leads to a meeting with finance tycoon Carl Van Loon, who tests him by seeking advice on a merger with Hank Atwood's company. After the meeting, Eddie experiences an 18-hour loss of memory, which he refers to as a \"time skip\". The next day in a meeting with Van Loon, Eddie sees a news telecast that a woman has been murdered in her hotel room. Eddie recognizes her as the woman he slept with during his time skip and abruptly leaves the meeting.\n\nEddie realizes that everyone taking NZT-48 is either hospitalized or dead. A man in a trench coat is revealed to have been following him. Lindy tells Eddie she cannot be with him while he is on the drug. Eddie experiments with NZT-48 and learns to control his dosage, sleep schedule, and food intake to prevent side effects. He hires a laboratory in an attempt to reverse-engineer the drug, an attorney to keep the police from investigating the death of Vernon or the woman, and two bodyguards to protect him from Gennady, a loan shark, who is threatening him to obtain more NZT-48.\n\nOn the day of the merger, Atwood falls into a coma. Eddie recognizes Atwood's driver as the man in the trench coat and realizes Atwood is on NZT-48. While Eddie participates in a police lineup, his attorney steals Eddie's supply of pills from his jacket pocket. Eddie enters into withdrawal, and while Van Loon questions him about Atwood's coma, Eddie receives a parcel that is found to contain the severed hands of his bodyguards. He hurries home and locks himself in, before Gennady breaks into Eddie's apartment, demanding more NZT-48. Gennady flaunts his abilities while injecting himself with NZT-48, explaining that by injecting it directly into the bloodstream, the effects last longer and the withdrawal symptoms are lessened. As Gennady threatens to eviscerate him, Eddie grabs his own knife and kills Gennady. Eddie then consumes Gennady's blood to ingest the NZT-48 in the blood. This gives Eddie the mental abilities of the drug once again, and he is able to kill the remaining henchmen. He then meets with the man in the trench coat, surmising that Atwood employed the man to locate more NZT-48. Once Atwood dies, the two recover Eddie's stash from his attorney's apartment.\n\nA year later, Eddie has retained his wealth, published a book, and is running for the [[United States Senate]]. Van Loon visits him and reveals that he has absorbed the company that produced NZT-48 and shut down Eddie's laboratory and both acknowledge that Eddie will likely become [[President of the United States]] one day, so Van Loon offers Eddie a continued supply of the drug in exchange for Eddie assisting his ambitions. Eddie tells Van Loon that he has already perfected the drug and weaned himself off of it, retaining his abilities without side effects.\n\nEddie goes to lunch with Lindy. After speaking Chinese to the waiter, Lindy looks at Eddie, wondering if he's really off NZT. He looks at Lindy and says \"What?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Edward \"Eddie\" Morra\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Lindy\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Carlos \"Carl\" Van Loon\n* [[Anna Friel]] as Melissa Gant\n* [[Johnny Whitworth]] as Vernon Gant\n* [[Richard Bekins]] as Henry \"Hank\" Atwood\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Donald \"Don\" Pierce\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as the Man in Tan Coat\n* [[T.V.

The result is classic Hollywood star magnetism, engaging auds [audiences] physically and vocally, as his narration proves to be a crucial element of the pic's humor.\" The critic also positively compared Willems' cinematography to the style in ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2006 film)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (2006) and commended the tempo set by the film's editors [[Naomi Geraghty]] and Tracy Adams and by composer [[Paul Leonard-Morgan]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Koehler | first=Robert | url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944818?refCatId=31 | title=Film Reviews: Limitless | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=March 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n''Limitless'' received the award for Best Thriller at the [[2011 Scream Awards]] and was nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] at the [[38th Saturn Awards|2012 Saturn Awards]], but lost to ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref>{{cite news| agency=Associated Press | newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | title=Pee Wee, Potter, Vader honored at Scream Awards | date=2011-10-16 | access-date=2011-10-16 | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Pee-Wee-Potter-Vader-honored-at-Scream-Awards-2221236.php#photo-1675608}}</ref><ref>[http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html Nominations for the 38th Annual Saturn Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221234527/http://www.saturnawards.org/nominations.html |date=2012-02-21 }}, saturnawards.org, February 29, 2012.</ref>\n\n''Limitless'' has been discussed in academic scholarly debates, notably on [[human enhancement]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236181726 |last1=Zwart |first1=H |title=Limitless as a neuro-pharmaceutical experiment and as a Daseinsanalyse: on the use of fiction in preparatory debates on cognitive enhancement |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |date=February 2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=29\u201338 |doi=10.1007/s11019-013-9481-5 |pmid=23585022|s2cid=29893291 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2635803|last=Zwart |first=H. |date=2015|chapter=A new lease on life: A lacanian analysis of cognitive enhancement cinema|editor1-last= Hauskeller |editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=Philbeck  |editor2-first=T. |editor3-last=Carbonell |editor3-first=C.|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Posthumanism in Film and Television |publisher=Palgrave / MacMillan |pages=214\u2013224}}</ref>\n\n==TV spin-off==\n{{Main|Limitless (TV series)}}\nBradley Cooper announced in October 2013 that Leslie Dixon, Scott Kroopf, and he  would be executive producers of a television series based on ''Limitless''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/29011/bradley-cooper-producing-limitless-tv-series|title=Bradley Cooper Producing 'Limitless' TV Series |publisher=Dark Horizons}}</ref> On November 3, 2014, [[CBS]] announced it would be financing a pilot episode for the ''Limitless'' TV series.
