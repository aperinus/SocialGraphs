It is the third theatrical film in [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]]. In addition to the Muppet performance, the film features special appearances by [[Art Carney]], [[James Coco]], [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Linda Lavin]], and [[Joan Rivers]]. Filmed in [[New York City]] during the prior summer, it was released theatrically on July 13, 1984, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. A fantasy sequence in the film introduced the [[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]], toddler versions of the lead Muppet characters.\n\n''Muppets Take Manhattan'' was the first film to be directed solely by Oz, who previously co-directed ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' with [[Jim Henson]]. Not counting the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' film ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird|Follow That Bird]]'', it is the final Muppet film produced before the deaths of Henson and [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing graduating from Danhurst College, [[The Muppets]] perform their theatrical production of ''Manhattan Melodies'' for their class. Upon the suggestion of taking the show to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], the ensemble proceed with the idea, certain they will become stars instantly. Arriving in [[Manhattan]], the group meet producer Martin Price, but the police arrive and reveal he is a wanted [[con artist]] before arresting him. The Muppets try other producers to no avail, leading to their morale and finances taking a nosedive. Thinking they are becoming a burden to [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] when he snaps at them, the rest of the Muppets agree to go their separate ways for new occupations, though [[Miss Piggy]] secretly remains in Manhattan to keep an eye on Kermit. Though disappointed by the development, Kermit vows to make the show a hit and enlists the assistance of diner owner Pete, his aspiring fashion designer daughter Jenny, and the diner's staff of rats led by [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]].\n\nKermit's attempts to promote fail, and, in the form of post, learns that [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] house manages a Cleveland, Ohio movie theater; [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] joins some other bears in hibernating within the forests of Maine where he has a hard time sleeping; [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]] have a gig in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, performing in a retirement home; [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla]] are trying to make a successful water skiing act in Michigan; and [[Rowlf the Dog|Rowlf]] is working at a dog kennel in Delaware. While in [[Central Park]], Jenny comforts Kermit about his losses, while an envious Piggy watches. Distracted, Piggy's purse is stolen but she takes chase and, in the ensuing chaos, reunites with Kermit, and takes a job at Pete's.\n\nKermit receives a letter from producer Bernard Crawford, who is interested in the musical. However, the letter was actually written by his son Ronnie, who is struggling to prove himself as a producer and believes that in ''Manhattan Melodies'' is good. Bernard himself is hesitant but agrees to fund the show. Thrilled, Kermit heads back to the diner but is so distracted that he walks into oncoming traffic and is struck by a passing car.\n\nPiggy summons the rest of the Muppets back to New York, only to discover that Kermit has disappeared. At the hospital, Kermit has [[Amnesia|lost memory of his life]]. He makes his way to Madison Avenue where he meets a trio of frogs, Bill, Gill and Jill, who work in advertising and offer him a job. He takes the job and begins going by \"Phil\". The rest of the Muppets search for Kermit. Bill, Gill, Jill and Kermit end up at Pete's diner where Kermit's friends recognize him when he unknowingly plays the show's opening numberr. At the [[Biltmore Theatre]] on opening night, the Muppets try to help Kermit remember. When Kermit laughs at the idea of being in love with Piggy, she karate chops him, restoring his memory. As they prepare for the opening number, the Muppets ask Kermit if their new friends can watch from backstage. Kermit, realizing the show needs more Muppets, suggests that the Madison Avenue frogs, the dogs, the bears, the chickens and others become [[supernumerary actor]]s.\n\nThe show is a hit, culminating in what is intended to be a staged wedding between Kermit and Miss Piggy's characters, only for a real minister to appear in lieu of Gonzo. With all of the Muppets, the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' Muppets and Uncle Traveling Matt from ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' present, the show ends as is.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Louis Zorich]] as Pete, the owner and [[chef]] of Pete's Diner.\n* [[Juliana Donald]] as Jenny, Pete's daughter who works as a waitress and aspiring fashion designer.\n* [[Lonny Price]] as Ronnie Crawford, Bernard's son and an aspiring Broadway producer.\n* [[Gates McFadden|Cheryl McFadden]] as Nancy, the [[secretary]] to Martin Price.\n* [[Graham Brown (actor)|Graham Brown]] as Mr. Wrightson\n\n===Muppets performers and voice cast===\n{{main|List of Muppets}}\n* [[Jim Henson]] as [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]], [[Swedish Chef|The Swedish Chef]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]], [[List of Muppets#The Newsman|The Muppet Newsman]], Baby Kermit, Baby Rowlf, [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] \n* [[Frank Oz]] as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Animal|Animal]], [[Sam Eagle]], Baby Piggy, Baby Fozzie, [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Cookie Monster]] \n* [[Jerry Nelson]] as [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Floyd Pepper|Floyd Pepper]], [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]], [[List of Muppets#Crazy Harry|Crazy Harry]], [[List of Muppets#Pops|Pops]], [[List of Muppets#Bobo the Bear|Bear]] \n* [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] as [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]], Baby Scooter, [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]\n* [[Dave Goelz]] as [[Gonzo (Muppet)|The Great Gonzo]], Chester the Rat, Bill the Frog, [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]]; a Penguin, Jim the Dog, Baby Gonzo, [[List of Muppets#Beauregard|Beauregard]] (scenes deleted), [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] \n* [[Steve Whitmire]] as [[Rizzo the Rat]], Gill the Frog, Bear\n* Bruce Edward Hall as Masterson the Rat, Beth Bear\n* [[Kathryn Mullen]] as Jill the Frog\n* [[Karen Prell]] as Yolanda the Rat, Frank the Dog \n* [[Brian Meehl|Brian Muehl]] as Tatooey the Rat\n\n===Cameo guest stars===\n* [[Frances Bergen]] as Mr. Winesop's [[receptionist]]\n* [[Art Carney]] as Bernard Crawford, a known theatrical producer and Ronnie's father.\n* [[James Coco]] as Mr. Skeffington, a man who leaves his dog at the kennel that Rowlf works at.\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Murray Plotsky, a [[Confidence trick|con artist]] posing as a theatrical producer named Martin Price.\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as a police officer at Pete's Diner.

Having directed ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]], Henson decided to serve as executive producer for the film while David Lazer serves as producer. Upon selecting fellow Muppet performer and ''The Dark Crystal'' co-director [[Frank Oz]] to handle directorial duties, Henson stated, \"I was looking at the year ahead and I thought my life was very busy and I thought maybe it was a time to have Frank directing one of these.\"<ref name=book>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian Jay|title=Jim Henson: The Biography|year=2013|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-52611-3|pages=234, 237|chapter=Twists and Turns}}</ref>\n\nThe first draft titled ''The Muppets: The Legend Continues'', written by ''Muppet Caper'' screenwriters [[Jay Tarses]] and Tom Patchett, was dismissed by Oz for being \"way too over jokey\".<ref name=book/> After being given Henson's encouragement to tinker with the script, Oz revised the screenplay in an effort to develop the \"''oomph'' of the characters and their relationships\".<ref name=book/> Once the script was completed and the sets were built, special consultant David Misch was brought in to write cameos for some guest star appearances. Originally, this list of guest stars contained [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], and [[Laurence Olivier]] to name a few. According to Misch, Hoffman was going to play a Broadway producer and planned to do an imitation of film producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] (''[[The Godfather]]''), which he later did in the film ''[[Wag the Dog]]''. However, at the last minute, Hoffman decided that the role could be offensive to Evans and dropped out, following which all the other big names dropped out as well. Because of the dropped cameos, Misch and Oz ended up rewriting most of the film's dialogue.<ref name=\"TP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.toughpigs.com/david-misch/|title=A Q&A with Muppet Writer David Misch|author=Ryan Roe|date=March 18, 2011|access-date=January 28, 2012|website=ToughPigs|via=[[WordPress]]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\n''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' was adapted by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1984, as the 68-page story in ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #32.<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 38141|title= ''Marvel Super Special'' #32}}</ref> The adaptation was later re-printed into a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], released under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint (November [[1984 in comics|1984]] \u2013 January [[1985 in comics|1985]]).<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2883|title= ''The Muppets Take Manhattan''}}</ref> The film's script was adapted into comic form by writer Stan Kay with art by [[Dean Yeagle]] and Jacqueline Roettcher.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Friedt|first= Stephan|title= Marvel at the Movies: The House of Ideas' Hollywood Adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 89|page= 69|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= July 2016|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Unlike in the film, the comic depicts Gonzo, Floyd Pepper, Animal, Janice, Dr. Teeth, and Zoot in their customary outfits from ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\nIn addition, a [[book-and-record set]] of the film was released in the form of a [[vinyl record]] through the Muppet Music Records label.\n\n===Home media===\nUnlike Henson's previous films (''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''), ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' was originally released by [[TriStar Pictures]] and not produced by [[ITC Films]], mainly because ITC was suffering from extreme financial difficulties at the time. Therefore, unlike the previous films, the distribution rights to ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' did revert to [[The Jim Henson Company]] in 1998, but did not revert to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2004. Due to this, it is one of three Muppet films (along with ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' and the [[direct-to-video]] feature ''[[Kermit's Swamp Years]]'') whose home video distribution rights are still controlled by [[Sony Pictures]], and not the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].\n\n''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' was first released on [[VHS]] and the now defunct [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED Videodisc]] format by [[CBS/Fox Video]] in 1985, which then reissued it in 1991, followed by a release from [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Video]] and [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Home Entertainment]] on June 1, 1999. The 1999 VHS contained a slightly edited cut from previous versions, possibly derived from the TV broadcast version. Cuts include removal of the audio from the TriStar logo, the scenes of [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] shouting \"Bad man!\" to Mr. Price, removal of the words \"Oh my God\" in one scene, and scenes with [[Miss Piggy]] hitting the purse snatcher.\n\nA [[DVD]] version was released on June 5, 2001 with the cuts from the 1999 VHS version restored.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Muppets Take Manhattan |publisher= [[DVD Talk]]|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/2097/muppets-take-manhattan/|access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref> A [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] edition was released on August 16, 2011, and contains the same bonus features as the DVD.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Muppets Take Manhattan (Blu-ray) |publisher= [[DVD Talk]]|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/50079/muppets-takes-manhattan-blu-ray-dvd-combo-pack/|access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nOn its opening weekend, ''The Muppets Take Manhattan'' grossed $4.4 million, ranking at fifth place at the box office.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sanello |first=Frank |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/07/17/Ghostbusters-Gremlins-still-top-box-office-after-six-weeks/6636458884800/ |title='Ghostbusters,' 'Gremlins' still top box office after six weeks |work=[[United Press International]] |date=July 17, 1984 |access-date=July 27, 2021}}</ref> The film ultimately earned $25.5 million in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> placing it as the second highest-grossing G-rated film of 1984 (behind the re-issue of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]]' ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/mpaarating.htm?rating=G&yr=1984&p=.htm |title=1984 Yearly Box Office By MPAA Rating \u2013 All G Rated Releases |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202225630/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/mpaarating.htm?rating=G&yr=1984&p=.htm |work=Box Office Mojo |archive-date=December 2, 2015 |access-date=July 27, 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a three star rating (out of four) stating in his review that \"the plot of [the] movie has been seen before.\" However, Ebert went on to say that just about everything in the film was enjoyable and that Kermit finally solves his long-lasting identity crisis.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-muppets-take-manhattan-1984|title=The Muppets Take Manhattan|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=July 13, 1984|access-date=January 29, 2012}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film {{frac|3|1|2}} stars (out of four) writing it was \"a most enjoyable backstage musical, culminating, as you probably have heard, with a wedding ceremony between you-know-who and you-know-who.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (July 13, 1984).
