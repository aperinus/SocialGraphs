M. Forster]]. Marking [[Merchant Ivory Productions]]' third adaptation of a Forster novel (following 1985's ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]'', and 1987's ''[[Maurice (film)|Maurice]]''), it was the first film to be released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]]. The film's narrative explores class relations in turn-of-the-20th-century Britain, through events in the lives of the Schlegel sisters.\n\n''Howards End'' premiered at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] and won the 45th Anniversary Award. The film was theatrically released on  March 13, 1992 in the United States and on May 1, in the United Kingdom to critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $26.3 million on a $8 million budget. At the [[65th Academy Awards]], the film received a leading nine nominations including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won three; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Thompson), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. At the [[46th British Academy Film Awards]], it garnered a leading eleven nominations, winning two awards; [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]] (for Thompson).\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] Britain, Helen Schlegel becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox during a moment of passion, while she is staying at the country home of the Wilcox family, Howards End. The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German [[bourgeoisie]], while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, led by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but Helen has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, which causes an uproar when the sisters' Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene.\n\nMonths later, when the Wilcox family takes a flat across the street from the Schlegels in London, Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Mrs. Ruth Wilcox, whom she had briefly met before. Ruth is descended from English [[yeoman]] stock, and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes have come to own Howards End, a house she loves dearly.\n\nOver the course of the next few months, the two women become very good friends, even as Mrs. Wilcox's health declines. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels' house is due to expire, Ruth on her death bed bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation to the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her \"right mind\" or could possibly have intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper on which Ruth's bequest is written, deciding to ignore it completely.\n\nHenry Wilcox, Ruth's widower, begins to develop an attraction to Margaret, and agrees to assist her in finding a new home. Eventually he proposes marriage, which Margaret accepts.\n\nSome time before this, the Schlegels had befriended a self-improving young clerk, Leonard Bast, who lives with a woman of dubious origins named Jacky. Both sisters find Leonard remarkable, appreciating his intellectual curiosity and desire to improve his lot in life. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that Leonard must leave his post, because the insurance company he works for is supposedly heading for bankruptcy. Leonard takes the advice and quits, but has to settle for a job paying much less, which he eventually loses altogether due to downsizing of its business. Helen is later enraged to learn that Henry's advice was wrong; Leonard's first employer had been perfectly sound but won't reemploy him.\n\nMonths later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his [[Shropshire]] estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with Jacky and Leonard Bast, whom she has found living in poverty. Considering Henry responsible for their plight, Helen demands that he help them. However, Jacky becomes drunk at the reception, and when she sees Henry she recognizes and exposes him as a former lover from years ago. Henry is embarrassed and ashamed to have been revealed as an [[adulterer]] in front of Margaret, but she forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. After the wedding, Helen, upset with Margaret's decision to marry a man she loathes, prepares to leave for Germany, but not before giving in to her attraction for Leonard by having sex with him while out boating.\n\nFearing that the Basts will be penniless, Helen sends instruction from Germany to her donnish brother, Tibby, to make over \u00a35000 of her own money to Leonard. Leonard returns the cheque uncashed, refusing to accept the money through pride.\n\nMargaret and Henry marry, with the pair arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret's and her siblings' belongings. After months of hearing from Helen only through postcards, Margaret grows concerned. When Aunt Juley falls ill, Helen returns to England to visit her, but when she receives word that her aunt has recovered, avoids seeing Margaret or any of her family.\n\nFearing that Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, only to turn up herself with Henry and a doctor. However, on first glance she realizes that Helen is heavily pregnant. Helen insists on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone, but asks that she be allowed to stay the night at Howards End before she leaves. When Margaret requests this from Henry, he stubbornly refuses and the couple bicker.\n\nThe next day, Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, leaves London and travels to Howards End to visit the Schlegel sisters. When he arrives he finds Helen and Margaret, as well as Henry's brutish eldest son, Charles. Charles quickly realizes that Leonard is the baby's father, and begins assaulting him for \"dishonoring\" Helen.\n\nIn his rage, Charles beats Leonard with the flat of a sword, and Leonard grabs onto a bookcase for support. The bookcase collapses on him, which causes Leonard to have a heart attack and die.\n\nMargaret tells Henry that she is leaving him to help Helen raise her baby, and Henry breaks down, telling her the police inquest will charge Charles with manslaughter.\n\nA year later, Paul, Evie, and Charles's wife, Dolly, gather at Howards End. Henry and Margaret are still together and Helen and her young son live with them. Henry, who is not looking well, tells the others that upon his death, Margaret will inherit Howards End and leave it to her nephew. Margaret wants none of Henry's money, which will be split among his children. Dolly points out the irony of Margaret's inheriting the house, revealing Mrs. Wilcox's dying wish to leave it to Margaret. She overhears this and Henry tells Margaret he did what he thought was right. She says nothing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Margaret Schlegel\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Helen Schlegel\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Ruth Wilcox\n* [[Joseph A.

This was considerably larger than that of ''[[Maurice (film)|Maurice]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]'', which led to trouble in raising capital in the UK and the United States. [[Orion Pictures]], the film's distributor, was on the verge of bankruptcy and only contributed a small amount to the overall budget.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite video| title=Building Howards End | medium=dvd | publisher=Criterion Collection | year=2005 }}</ref> A solution presented itself when Merchant Ivory sought funding through an intermediary in Japan, where the previous Forster adaptations, particularly ''Maurice'', had been very successful. Eventually Japanese companies including the [[Sumitomo Corporation]], Japan Satellite Broadcasting, and the [[Imagica]] Corporation provided the bulk of the film's financing. The distribution problem would be solved when the heads of [[Orion Classics]] departed the company for [[Sony Pictures]], creating the entirely new division of [[Sony Pictures Classics]]. ''Howards End'' was the first title distributed by this new division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sonyclassics.com/about-us/|title=Sony Pictures Classics - About Us|publisher=SonyClassics.com}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Anthony Hopkins]] accepted the part of Henry Wilcox after reading the script, passed to him by a young woman who was helping edit ''[[Slaves of New York]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' simultaneously in the same building. [[Phoebe Nicholls]], [[Joely Richardson]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Tilda Swinton]] were all considered for the part of Margaret Schlegel before [[Emma Thompson]] accepted the role.
