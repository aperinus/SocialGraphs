He believed that the script would not be cinematic enough if it was too faithful with the source.\n\nHe discussed the casting including his push for Alan Arkin as Freud. He shared a story about how he and Ross decided to cast Duvall \"in revolt\" against [[Nigel Bruce]]'s portrayal of Watson as a \"[[Colonel Blimp]]\"-type character.
