It stars [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Ray Liotta]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with [[Peter Berg]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Michael Rapaport]], and [[Annabella Sciorra]] in supporting roles. Stallone portrays the sheriff of a small New Jersey town who comes into conflict with the corrupt New York City police officers living in the community. The film received positive reviews and grossed $63.7 million on a $15 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe town of Garrison, [[New Jersey]] is home to a cadre of policemen from the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s 37th Precinct: Lt. Ray Donlan, Det. Leo Crasky, and officers Gary Figgis, Jack Rucker, Frank Lagonda, and Joey Randone. Exploiting a loophole in department regulations allowing them to live outside the city by being designated \"auxiliary transit cops\", Donlan and his group are effectively untouchable by the NYPD's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] division and are further protected by [[Sheriff]] Freddy Heflin. Unable to fulfill his lifelong dream of joining the NYPD due to deafness in one ear after nearly drowning while rescuing a woman years earlier, Heflin idolizes Donlan and refuses to help IA investigator Lt. Moe Tilden in his attempt to build a case against the [[police corruption|dirty cops]].\n\nOne night, Donlan's nephew, Officer Murray Babitch, is sideswiped by two [[African Americans|African-American]] teens while driving across the [[George Washington Bridge]]. One of the teens points what looks like a weapon at Babitch just as his tire blows out from a glass puncture; a frightened Babitch shoots them both dead. Donlan, Rucker, and Crasky show up and try to [[false evidence|plant a gun]] in the teens' car, only to get caught by a paramedic. In desperation, Donlan convinces Babitch to fake his suicide before hiding him in Garrison with a promise that he will set him up with a new identity.\n\nRandone's wife Liz\u2014the woman Heflin saved from drowning\u2014visits Heflin at his home and they confess their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, Figgis is kicked out of Donlan's circle, and his house burns down soon after with his girlfriend inside; Heflin lets him stay at his home thinking that Donlan tried to kill him. Fearing that Babitch will expose him, Donlan unsuccessfully tries to drown his nephew. Babitch then goes to Heflin for help but flees when he sees Figgis. While on patrol, Randone is attacked and thrown over the edge of a building; Donlan deliberately lets him fall in retaliation for Randone's affair with his wife Rose.\n\nHeflin, tired of being pushed around by Donlan and his men, visits Tilden to offer his help with the investigation, only to learn that the mayor, under pressure from Donlan's allies in the police union, has ordered IA to cease investigating. As Heflin leaves, he steals discarded IA files that reveal Donlan's ties to the mob and how he used those connections to create a safe haven in Garrison while trafficking drugs through the 37th Precinct, even having a cop who sought to testify against him stabbed to death in his jail cell. Heflin brings the files to his deputies Cindy and Bill, but Cindy, tired of the corruption in Garrison, resigns from her post.\n\nAfter Lagonda threatens him at gunpoint, Heflin looks into the fire at Figgis' house and realizes that it was [[arson]]. Figgis admits that he started the fire to commit insurance fraud so he could leave Garrison and start over. The two men argue, and Figgis abandons Heflin and drives away. Heflin goes to Rose and convinces her to reveal where Babitch is hiding, planning to hand him over to Tilden. After sending Bill away for his own protection, Heflin walks Babitch over to his car but is ambushed by Rucker who fires a gun next to his good ear, leaving him completely deaf. Discombobulated, Heflin follows him as he drives Babitch over to Donlan's residence.\n\nIn the ensuing shootout, Heflin kills Lagonda and Rucker; Crasky wounds him in the shoulder before Figgis suddenly appears and guns him down. Inside, Donlan tries to shoot Heflin in the back before Figgis distracts him, resulting in Heflin fatally shooting him in the chest. The two men drive Babitch to [[One Police Plaza]] and deliver him to Tilden. Figgis [[Turn state's evidence|turns state's evidence]], resulting in sweeping arrests and indictments across the union, the mob, and the 37th Precinct. Heflin undergoes medical treatment to fix his good ear and returns to his old job in Garrison.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Sheriff Freddy Heflin \n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Ray Donlan\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Gary \"Figgsy\" Figgis\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Moe Tilden\n* [[Peter Berg]] as Joey Randone\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Deputy Sheriff Cindy Betts\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Officer Jack Rucker\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Murray \"Superboy\" Babitch\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Liz Randone\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Deputy Sheriff Bill Geisler\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Rose Donlan\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Leo Crasky\n* [[Frank Vincent]] as PDA President Lassaro\n* [[Malik Yoba]] as Detective Carson\n* [[Arthur Nascarella]] as Frank Lagonda\n* [[Victor Williams]] as Officer Russell Ames\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Berta (Bomb Squad Agent)\n* [[Mel Gorham]] as Monica Lopez\n* [[Paul Herman]] as carnival worker\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Hector (GWB Paramedic)\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as Robert (GWB Paramedic)\n* [[Method Man]] as Shondel (rooftop perp)\n* [[Deborah Harry]] as Delores (4 Aces bartender)\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as Officer V \n* [[Tony Sirico]] as Salvatore \"Toy\" Torillo (photo only)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Development}}\nGarrison is based on Mangold's hometown of [[Washingtonville, New York]], located about {{convert|60|mi}} from New York City.

The initial extras-free DVDs had the theatrical cut in non-anamorphic widescreen, while subsequent issues, including various \"Collector's Editions\" on DVD and Blu-ray, have favoured the director's cut. [[StudioCanal]]'s French and German region B-locked Blu-rays exclusively feature both the 101-minute theatrical cut and 116-minute director's cut.\n\nExtras include an audio commentary (with James Mangold, Sylvester Stallone, Robert Patrick, and producer Cathy Konrad), \"The Making of an Urban Western\" featurette, a storyboard comparison, two deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.\n\nThe two deleted scenes primarily show the racism in the town of Garrison. One scene involves all the resident police officers chasing down a pair of black motorists, and the other shows Heflin's deputy pointing out that the majority of the tickets issued in Garrison go to black motorists on charges that suggest [[racial profiling]].\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critics}}\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'').  Additionally, ''Cop Land'' was to show Stallone in a completely different light, both physically (his 40-pound weight gain got a lot of press coverage),<ref name=\"Busch\" /> as well as artistically, by letting him showcase his acting skills. The film posted solid box-office takings ($44.9 million domestically<ref name=\"numbers\" />), got good reviews, and Stallone received positive critical notices for his performance. Yet Stallone has said the film was bad for his career. In a 2019 interview Stallone called Mangold \"the best director I ever worked with [but the film] actually worked in reverse.
