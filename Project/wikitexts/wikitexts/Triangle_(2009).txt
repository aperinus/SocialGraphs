When they are forced to abandon their ship, they board a derelict ocean liner, where they become convinced that someone is stalking them.\n\n== Plot ==\nJess prepares to take Tommy, her [[autism|autistic]] son, on a boat trip with her friend Greg and hears the doorbell ring, but no one is there. Jess drives to a [[Florida]] harbor without Tommy, explaining that he is at his special needs school, and boards Greg's boat with his married friends Sally and Downey, Heather, and Victor. At sea, a storm approaches, and while Greg radios the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], he picks up a [[distress signal]] from a woman frantically pleading help. The woman says that someone is killing everyone but is cut off before she can provide her location. The storm capsizes the boat and Heather is swept away by the ocean. The others climb onto the overturned boat when the storm clears.\n\nThe survivors board an [[ocean liner]] as it passes. It appears to be deserted despite the fact that they saw the silhouette of a person on the bridge deliberately ignoring their cries for help, and there is fresh food in the dining room. Jess experiences a sense of [[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]] as they explore the ship. They find Jess's keys near a display case for [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]], the ship's namesake. Jess spots someone watching them and Victor gives chase. She and Greg find \"Go To Theater\" written in blood on a mirror, but Greg insists it's just the crew playing a prank. Jess returns to the dining room, where the food is now rotting. Victor, covered in blood, tries to kill Jess but she fights him off.\n\nShe hears gunfire and follows it to a theater, where Greg lies dead of a gunshot. Sally and Downey say that Greg told them Jess shot him. A masked shooter kills them and chases Jess; she disarms the shooter, who tells her \"You have to kill them; it's the only way to get home\" before falling overboard.\n\nShe hears yelling and sees a second set of Jess and the others arrive on Greg's capsized boat and spot her as the earlier unseen figure: she drops her keys near the display case, is spotted, and attempts to warn Victor 2 when he chases her, only to accidentally impale his head on a wall hook. She finds dozens of the shooter's outfits, several shotguns, her own locket, and a note saying to kill them all when they board, written in her own handwriting. She takes a shotgun, intending to \"change the pattern,\" but the shooter, a third Jess repeating the loop, kills Greg and Downey 2 before mortally wounding Sally 2.\n\nThe first Jess chases Sally 2, who sends the distress signal heard on Greg's boat. Jess catches up to her on a deck filled with dozens of Sally corpses, and Sally succumbs to her wound as, below them, the second Jess kills the shooter Jess. The overturned boat returns again with another copy of Jess and the others, and Jess realizes the loop restarts once everyone is killed. Desperate to stop the loop, Jess sets everything from the first loop into motion, and cloaks her face using a tissue bag as a makeshift mask. After she is disarmed during the fight on the front deck, she urges her counterpart to kill everyone, and the second Jess knocks the original overboard.\n\nShe awakens washed ashore and discovers that it is the same morning. She returns home and watches from outside her house as her original morning self yells [[Child abuse|abusively]] at Tommy out of anger toward his autism. Promising to change, she distracts her counterpart with the doorbell, then kills her, puts the bagged body in the car trunk, and leaves with Tommy. A seagull hits their windshield and dies, but when she picks it up and disposes of it, she sees a pile of dead seagulls. Realizing that she is still trapped in the loop, Jess hurriedly drives away, but crashes into a truck. Tommy is killed on impact, and the double of Jess from the trunk is seen dead at the scene. In the aftermath, the real Jess stands watching the accident scene. A taxi driver approaches and she accepts a ride to the harbour. After promising to return, she joins the others on Greg's boat, starting the loop again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Melissa George]] as Jess\n* [[Michael Dorman]] as Greg\n* [[Rachael Carpani]] as Sally\n* [[Henry Nixon]] as Downey\n* [[Emma Lung]] as Heather\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as Victor\n* Joshua McIvor as Tommy\n* Bryan Probets as Cab Driver\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Triangle'' was a British-Australian co-production written and directed by [[Christopher Smith (director)|Christopher Smith]].
