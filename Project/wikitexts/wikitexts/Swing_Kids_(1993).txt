In pre-[[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], two high school students attempt to be [[swing kids]] by night and [[Hitler Youth]] by day, a decision that acutely impacts their friends and families.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the 1930s, some young German teens favored American and British pop culture; they hung out in secret underground clubs where bands played swing music and listened to contemporary music by acts like [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Duke Ellington]]. The film's screenwriter, Jonathan Marc Feldman, based the film on this eponymous Swing Kids (''[[Swingjugend]]'') movement.<ref name=a01>{{Cite web| title = 'Swing Kids' a Unique History Lesson | work=[[Doylestown Intelligencer]] |date=March 12, 1993 |via=[[NewspaperArchive]]|accessdate = 2018-07-08| url = https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-entertainment-clipping-mar-12-1993-744345/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Hamburg]] in 1939, Peter M\u00fcller and Thomas Berger join their friends Arvid and Otto at a swing club called the Bismarck. They have a good time, dancing and enjoying the music.\n\nPeter goes home to find his mother in an argument with the Nazi [[Blockleiter]] (block leader). Herr Knopp, head of the local [[Gestapo]], arrives and curtly dismisses the Blockleiter.  Herr Knopp begins asking Frau M\u00fcller questions about some of her late husband's friends. Herr M\u00fcller had been accused of being a communist, and his health was irreparably damaged by an interrogation at the hands of Nazi agents.\n\nAt Arvid's house, Thomas accidentally ruins one of Arvid's prized records. Upset, Arvid kicks Thomas, Peter and Otto out. To apologize to Arvid, Peter and Thomas steal a radio (which Peter knows was stolen from a ransacked Jewish home) from a bakery. Thomas escapes, but Peter is caught. Herr Knopp, who is attracted to Peter's mother, intercedes for him; in return, Peter must enroll in the ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' (Hitler Youth).\n\nPeter, who has a job delivering books, is asked to spy on his boss, whom the Nazis suspect is working against the Reich. In HJ school, the boys are encouraged to spy on their friends and families. Thomas accuses his father of insulting Hitler, hoping to cause trouble for him, but is unnerved when the Nazis come to his home and take his father away. His subsequent attempts to resume his friendship with Peter and persuade him to collaborate with the Nazis are tinged with fear.\n\nArvid, who is working at a jazz club, refuses to play a German song, lashing out at the club's patrons for being blind to the Nazi agenda. Peter is sympathetic but Thomas loudly argues the Nazi side. Peter angrily proclaims Thomas to be a \"fucking Nazi\" and storms off. After he is badly beaten by Nazis, leaving him struggling to play the guitar, Arvid realizes there is nothing for him in Germany and dies by suicide.\n\nAs Thomas begins to believe fully in Nazi ideology, Peter feels as though there is no hope for him. Peter, disenchanted with how his life is coming apart, dresses up and goes to a swing club which is scheduled to be raided by members of the ''Hitlerjugend''. As Thomas begins assaulting the club's patrons he attacks Peter; however, during the fight Peter is able to reach Thomas. Thomas begs Peter to run away but Peter won't. Willie M\u00fcller is there and as Peter is driven away by the police, he loudly screams \"Swing Heil!\" over and over again, proud that his brother stood up for being a swing kid.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Peter M\u00fcller\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Thomas Berger\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Arvid\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Frau M\u00fcller\n* [[Tushka Bergen]] as Evey\n* [[David Tom]] as Willi M\u00fcller\n* Julia Stemberger as Frau Linge\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Knopp\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as Emil Lutz\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Helga\n* [[Martin Clunes]] as Bannf\u00fchrer\n* Jayce Bartok as Otto\n\n==Reception==\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a score of 56% (based on 18 reviews) and an average score of 4.93/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swing_kids/?name_order=asc |title=Swing Kids |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105050059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swing_kids/?name_order=asc |archive-date=2012-11-05 }}</ref> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as a \"corny but sincere weeper\", while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film one star (out of 4) and criticized the screenplay (calling it \"murky\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swing-kids/Film?oid=1070788 |title=Swing Kids |date=26 October 1985 |publisher=Chicago Reader |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015034749/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swing-kids/Film?oid=1070788 |archive-date=2012-10-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/swing-kids-1993 |title=Swing Kids|website=Roger Ebert|date=1993-03-05 |access-date=2021-10-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009052030/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19930305%2FREVIEWS%2F303050306%2F1023 |archive-date=2012-10-09 }}</ref> and including it on his \"Most Hated\" list).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/COMMENTARY/50808002 |title=Ebert's Most Hated|publisher=Roger Ebert |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628183709/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FCOMMENTARY%2F50808002 |archive-date=2009-06-28 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 39 (based on 20 reviews).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/swing-kids |title=Swing Kids Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724053233/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/swing-kids |archive-date=2012-07-24 }}</ref> ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' called it \"amazing\" saying the \"well-researched film is wonderfully acted\".<ref>[http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N11/swing.11a.html Strong acting allows Swing Kids to overcome slow plot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809152247/http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N11/swing.11a.html |date=2012-08-09 }}</ref>\n\nA contemporary film reviewer wrote:<ref name=a01 />\n<blockquote>In the eyes of today's teenagers, Nazis are simplistic villains who get outsmarted, out-gunned and outmaneuvered by Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and other simplistic action-adventure tales.
