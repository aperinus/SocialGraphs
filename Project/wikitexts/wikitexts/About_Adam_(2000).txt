The plot focuses on the effect a seductive young man has on four siblings.\n\n==Plot==\nAdam is a young [[Dublin]]er who ingratiates himself into the Owens family after meeting Lucy at the restaurant where she waits tables and sings. While wooing her, he becomes involved with her more reserved older sister Laura, a romantic literary type who spends most of her time at the library, her oldest married sister Alice, a new mother who is unhappy with her boring husband Martin, and her brother David, who seeks Adam's advice on how to seduce his repressed girlfriend, only to find himself nearly succumbing to Adam's charms himself.\n\nRevisits are made to several scenes, each seen from the [[Point of view (literature)|point-of-view]] of a different character.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stuart Townsend]] ..... Adam\n*[[Kate Hudson]] ..... Lucy Owens\n*[[Frances O'Connor]] ..... Laura Owens\n*[[Rosaleen Linehan]] ..... Peggy Owens\n*[[Charlotte Bradley]] ..... Alice Owens Rooney\n*Alan Maher ..... David Owens\n*Brendan Dempsey ..... Martin Rooney\n\n==Production==\n[[Kate Hudson]] performs \"The Man I Love\" by [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], \"You Do Something to Me\" by [[Cole Porter]], and \"All the Way\" by [[Sammy Cahn]] and [[Jimmy Van Heusen]]. During the closing credits, [[Peggy Lee]] performs \"Sisters\" by [[Irving Berlin]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2000 and was shown at the [[Karlovy Vary Film Festival]] in the [[Czech Republic]] in July 2000 but wasn't released theatrically until it opened in Ireland in January 2001. It was given a very limited release in the U.S., where it grossed $159,668.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=aboutadam.htm|title=About Adam (2001) - Box Office Mojo|website=Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nStephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said \"Guilt-free and nearly devoid of erotic angst, ''About Adam'' is the flip side of movies like ''[[Teorema (film)|Teorema]]'', ''Something for Everyone'' and those slogging [[Tennessee Williams]] dramas in which an irresistible, omnisexual stud is often an angel of death. Here he is an angel of sexual health in an impossibly euphoric world where sibling rivalry and sexual jealousy are only passing twinges of discomfort, not consuming passions. The movie's blissful spirits coincide with its portrait of modern, freshly-scrubbed-looking Dublin as the closest thing to Fun City the British isles have to offer nowadays.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/arts/09ADAM.html|title=FILM REVIEW; Adam's the Apple of Her Eye, And Hers, and Hers and Hers|first=Stephen|last=Holden|date=9 May 2001|accessdate=2 September 2017|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nEmanuel Levy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"smartly sexy,\" a \"brightly observed narrative,\" and \"a frolic free of any judgments ... marked by Stembridge's sparkling wit.\" He added, \"Stembridge plays with shifting perspectives in a fresh manner that defies expectations of the romantic genre ... This literate ensembler is propelled by talent behind and in front of the camera. Townsend, who physically resembles the young [[Terence Stamp]], is perfectly cast as the dark, spirited outsider. Rest of the mostly female cast is equally deft and attractive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117778711.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |title=About Adam Review - Read Variety's Analysis of the Movie About Adam |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505230638/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117778711.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |archivedate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nMaitland McDonagh of ''[[TV Guide]]'' rated it three out of four stars, calling it \"sweet, likable and consistently engaging, if so insubstantial that it's always on the verge of blowing away\" and adding, \"Townsend pulls off the unenviable job of making Adam a [[chameleon]]-like seducer without allowing him to seem like a cad or a callous sexual opportunist ... Stembridge deftly balances genre expectations with just enough stylistic flourishes to make it feel surprisingly fresh. The movie starts to fade from memory as soon as it's over, but for an hour and a half it's a pleasantly diverting lark.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/adam/review/134532|title=About Adam|website=TV Guide|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0199314}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|about_adam}}\n* {{Amg movie|186951|About Adam}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:Irish romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:BBC Film films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
