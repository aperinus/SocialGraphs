The movie is based on the 1998 novel ''[[Black and Blue (Quindlen novel)|Black and Blue]]'', by [[Anna Quindlen]], which was a [[The New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]]. It stars [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Slim, an abused wife who learns to fight back. ''Enough'' garnered generally negative reviews from [[film critics]] on its release, though it is now often cited as an underrated thriller.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1331683/you-wont-be-able-to-get-enough-of-these-secrets-about-jennifer-lopezs-most-underrated-movie|title=You Won't Be Able to Get Enough of These Secrets About Jennifer Lopez's Most Underrated Movie|work=Eonline|first= Tierney|last=Bricker|date=May 22, 2022|access-date=June 3, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSlim ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) is a waitress in a Los Angeles diner where she meets Mitch Hiller ([[Billy Campbell]]), who wards off a rude man trying to hit on her. They eventually marry, have a daughter named Gracie (Tessa Allen), and live happily in an expensive house.\n\nSome years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her; when she threatens to leave, he begins to beat and threaten her. He insists that because he is the breadwinner, he gets to do whatever he likes, and he won't end his affair unless she wants to fight him.\n\nSlim goes to Mitch's mother ([[Janet Carroll]]) about the abuse, but she is unsympathetic and implies the abuse is Slim's fault. Her best friend Ginny ([[Juliette Lewis]]) tells her to leave him and press charges, but when she goes to the police, even they are unable to offer any help.\n\nMitch tells Slim he knows she discussed the abuse with his mother, beating her again, and she realizes she has no other choice but to take Gracie and leave. Slim enlists her friends to help her and Gracie escape late at night, but Mitch foils the plan. After some struggle, they all escape.\n\nMitch freezes and empties Slim's bank accounts, leaving her unable to rent a room. Tracking her down at a cheap motel, he tries to break into the room, but she escapes with Gracie, moving to Seattle to stay with an old friend, Joe ([[Dan Futterman]]).\n\nThe next day, men posing as the FBI show up and threaten Joe, damaging his apartment. Slim then goes to her wealthy, estranged father, Jupiter ([[Fred Ward]]). Even though Slim sent several unanswered letters to him as a child, Jupiter claims he is unaware of her existence and believes she is just after money, offering her only $12. Slim and Gracie briefly find refuge at a commune, where Jupiter later contacts her, revealing that Mitch's associates had threatened him, which caused him to be interested to help her. He sends her a large sum of money, which allows her to set up a new life under a new identity, and he lets her know to reach out if she needs more.\n\nJoe visits Slim, but Mitch tracks her down and she escapes with Gracie. Consulting a lawyer, she is warned there is little she can do. Slim then goes into hiding in San Francisco and sends Gracie away to safety while she trains in [[Krav Maga]] self defense while enlisting the help of a woman who looks identical to her. She breaks into Mitch's new home and hides his guns, jams the phone, plants fake letters saying she is there to discuss custody of Gracie, and awaits his return. When he arrives, they fight and Slim beats Mitch unconscious, before she eventually knocks him off a balcony to his death. The police regard her actions as self-defense. Slim and Gracie reunite and go to live with Joe in Seattle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Slim Hiller / Erin Ann Shleeter\n* [[Billy Campbell]] as Mitch Hiller\n* Tessa Allen as Gracie Hiller / Queen Elizabeth Shleeter, Slim and Mitch's daughter\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Ginny, Slim's friend\n* [[Dan Futterman]] as Joe, Slim's former boyfriend\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as Robbie, a cop and associate of Mitch\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Jupiter, Slim's father\n* [[Christopher Maher]] as Phil, Slim's stepfather\n* [[Janet Carroll]] as Mrs. Hiller, Mitch's mother\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Jim Toller\n* [[Bruce A.
