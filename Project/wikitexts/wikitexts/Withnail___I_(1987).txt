Loosely based on Robinson's life in London in the late 1960s, the plot follows two unemployed actors, Withnail and \"I\" (portrayed by [[Richard E. Grant]] and [[Paul McGann]], respectively) who share a flat in [[Camden Town]] in 1969. Needing a holiday, they obtain the key to a country cottage in the [[Lake District]] belonging to Withnail's eccentric uncle Monty and drive there. The weekend holiday proves less recuperative than they expected.\n\n''Withnail and I'' was Grant's first film and established his profile. The film featured performances by [[Richard Griffiths]] as Withnail's Uncle Monty and [[Ralph Brown]] as Danny the drug dealer. The film has tragic and comic elements and is notable for its period music and many quotable lines. It has been described by the [[BBC]] as \"one of Britain's biggest cult films\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/11/05/withnail_and_i_1987_article.shtml |title=How \"Withnail & I\" Became a Cult |first= Jamie |last=Russell |date=October 2003 |access-date=28 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\nThe character \"I\" is named \"Marwood\" in the published screenplay but goes unnamed in the film credits.<ref>{{cite web| title= Withnail and I  |publisher= [[Handmade Films]] |url= https://www.handmadefilms.film/library/withnail-and-i/ |access-date=17 January 2020}}</ref>{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn September 1969, two unemployed young actors, flamboyant alcoholic Withnail and contemplative Marwood, live in a messy flat in [[Camden Town]], London. Their only regular visitor is their drug dealer, Danny. One morning, the pair squabble about housekeeping and then leave to take a walk. In [[Regent's Park]], they discuss the poor state of their acting careers and the desire for a holiday; Marwood proposes a trip to a rural cottage near [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] owned by Withnail's wealthy uncle Monty. They visit Monty that evening at his luxurious [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] house. Monty is a melodramatic [[Aestheticism|aesthete]], who Marwood infers is homosexual. The three briefly drink together as Withnail casually lies to Monty about his acting career. He further deceives Monty by implying that Marwood attended [[Eton College]], whilst a lithograph of  [[Harrow School]] seen earlier in the flat suggests that both Monty and Withnail were educated there. Withnail persuades his uncle to lend them the cottage key and they leave.\n\nWithnail and Marwood drive to the cottage the next day but find the weather cold and wet, the cottage without provisions and the locals unwelcoming\u2014in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends in the pub. Marwood becomes anxious when he later sees Jake prowling around the cottage and suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed in the interest of safety but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail fears that the poacher wants to harm them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has brought supplies.\n\nThe next day, Marwood realises Monty's visit has ulterior motives when he makes aggressive sexual advances upon him; Withnail seems oblivious to this. Monty drives them into town to buy [[wellington boot]]s but they go to a pub instead. Monty is hurt, though he forgets the offence as the three drink and play poker. Marwood is terrified by the thought of Monty's further sexual overtures and wants to leave immediately, but Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood tries to avoid Monty's company but is eventually cornered in the guest bedroom as Monty demands sex. Monty also reveals that Withnail, during the visit in London, lied that Marwood was a closet homosexual. Marwood lies that Withnail is the closeted one and that the two of them are in a committed relationship, which Withnail wishes to keep secret from his family and that this is the first night in 6 years that they have not slept together. Monty, a romantic, believes this explanation and leaves after apologising for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail.\n\nThe next morning, they find Monty has left for London, leaving a note wishing them happiness together. They continue to argue. A telegram arrives from Marwood's agent with a possible offer of work and he insists they return. As Marwood sleeps in the car, Withnail drunkenly speeds most of the way back until pulled over by the police who arrest him for driving under the influence. The pair return to the flat to find Danny and a friend named Presuming Ed [[squatting]]. Marwood calls his agent and discovers he is wanted for the lead part in a play but will need to move to [[Manchester]] to take it. The four share a huge cannabis joint but the celebration ends when Marwood learns they have received an eviction notice for unpaid rent, while Withnail is too high to care. Marwood\u2014with new haircut\u2014packs a bag to leave for the railway station, taking a last look at his room. He turns down Withnail's offer of a goodbye drink, stating he hasn't enough time, so Withnail declares he will walk with him to the station. In Regent's Park, Marwood reciprocates Withnail's confession that he will miss him, but insists that they part ways there. Alone with bottle of wine in hand, Withnail impeccably performs \"[[What a piece of work is a man]]!\" from ''Hamlet'', but is seen only by the wolves in a nearby Zoo enclosure. Withnail turns to walk home alone in the rain.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard E. Grant]] as Withnail\n* [[Paul McGann]] as \"...& I\" (Marwood)\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Monty (Montague H.

This myth arose as a result of a line of misheard dialogue.<ref>Hewitt-McManus, Thomas: \"Twenty things you might want to know about Withnail & I\", DVD insert. Anchor Bay, 2006.</ref> In the scene where Monty meets the two actors, Withnail asks him if he would like a drink. In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says \"...you must tell me all the news, I haven't seen you since you finished your last film\". While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been \"Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff\". Then pointing at Marwood he says \"He's just had an audition for rep\". Some hear this line as \"''Peter'''s had an audition for rep\", although the original shooting script and all commercially published versions of the script read \"he's\".\n\nTowards the end of the film, a telegram arrives at Crow Crag on which the name \"Marwood\" is partially visible.\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Peter Frampton (make-up artist)|Peter Frampton]] worked as make-up artist, [[Sue Love]] as hair stylist and [[Andrea Galer]] worked as costume designer.<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n\n====Casting====\n[[Mary Selway]] worked as casting director.<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Withnail & I (1988) - BFI |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b78ba9397 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=2020-05-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul McGann]] was Robinson's first choice for \"I\" but he was fired during rehearsals because Robinson decided McGann's [[Scouse]] (Liverpool) accent was wrong for the character.
