It is the second sequel to television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' following ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth|The Ark of Truth]]''. It is directed by [[Martin Wood (director)|Martin Wood]], director and producer of many episodes of ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', written by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' creator [[Brad Wright]], and produced by Wright and ''Ark of Truth'' director [[Robert C. Cooper]].\n\nThe film is a time-travel adventure in which [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] travels back to 1939 to create an [[alternate timeline]] in which Earth never establishes their [[Stargate Program]], and to take control of the [[Goa'uld Empire]]. The only people to remember the truth, the SG-1 team attempts to reinstate the original timeline. The film stars the main cast of the show's last season, with the return of [[Richard Dean Anderson]] as [[Jack O'Neill]].\n\n''Continuum'' has garnered generally positive reviews from critics, earning both praise and criticism for its atmosphere, story, characters and graphic content. The production budget was $7 million and the film grossed over $8 million [[United States Dollar|USD]], less than the previous film, which grossed over $13 million. The film was released on both [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in the US by MGM's home media distributor [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] on July 29, 2008 and elsewhere in August 2008, followed by a TV premiere on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] on April 3, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nSG-1 and [[Jack O'Neill]] attend a [[Tok'ra]] extraction ceremony for [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ba'al|Ba'al]], the last of the [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s. Ba'al claims, however, that he is merely the last clone and that the real Ba'al has a [[fail-safe]] plan. The real Ba'al travels back in time to 1939 Earth and massacres the crew of the ''Achilles'', the ship carrying the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to the United States; the captain lives long enough to drop the bomb Ba'al left overboard and keep the ship from being destroyed. In the present, people and objects start disappearing, including [[Vala Mal Doran]] and [[Teal'c]]. Jack is killed by the clone, but [[Samantha Carter]], [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] and [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] reach the Stargate. They are surprised to emerge inside the derelict ''Achilles'', which has drifted to the Arctic&nbsp;\u2014 Ba'al's actions have created a timeline in which the [[Stargate Program]] never happened. After escaping from the sinking ''Achilles'', they are rescued by a team led by Colonel Jack O'Neill. Although General [[Hank Landry (Stargate)|Landry]] believes their story (after intensive interrogation), they are denied permission to change the timeline. In the alternate timeline, Daniel is still trying to convince people about his theories of the pyramids, Carter died in a space shuttle accident and Mitchell does not exist at all because his grandfather was the ''Achilles'' captain. The three are forced by the authorities to lead separate lives, with no contact allowed between them.\n\nA year passes, and SG-1 is called back into action when Goa'uld scoutships appear. Ba'al has brought the other System Lords under his control and now stands ready to conquer Earth, with [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Qetesh|Qetesh]], still residing in Vala's body, as his queen and Teal'c as his First Prime. SG-1 is brought to President [[Henry Hayes (Stargate)|Henry Hayes]] and General [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]], who inform them that, based on SG-1's accounts, they have recovered the Antarctic Stargate and are excavating the Antarctic Ancient outpost to reach the weapon that saved Earth in the original timeline. SG-1 is sent in [[F-15]]s to [[McMurdo Station]] to gate to [[Proclarush Taonas]], another Ancient outpost, to retrieve a Zero Point Module to power the Antarctic outpost.\n\nAbove Earth, Ba'al's armada arrives. To the displeasure of his subordinates, the other System Lords, Ba'al announces that he will treat the [[Tau'ri]] relatively leniently. Suspicious about Ba'al's thorough knowledge of Earth, Qetesh betrays him and forces him to tell her everything. She orders the destruction of McMurdo and the Ancient outpost in Ba'al's name, but she kills Ba'al when Teal'c discovers what she is doing. As Teal'c escapes to an Al'kesh, Qetesh orders the fleet to bombard Earth, while she goes to secure Ba'al's time machine.\n\nWhen the Goa'uld destroy the Antarctic Stargate, SG-1 is rerouted to [[Russia]], as the Russians had retrieved the ''Achilles''{{'}} Stargate from the ocean floor. Teal'c arrives at the facility as well, seeking to use the Stargate to reach the time machine before Qetesh. The two sides agree to a truce and get to Ba'al's time machine: an underground supercomputer connected to hundreds of satellites that monitor [[solar flare]]s from various stars that could intersect a [[wormhole]] created by the Stargate; the flares are necessary for time travel. SG-1 must wait for the right flare in order to journey to the right time, but when Qetesh's troops attack, they are forced to dial the Stargate to the year 1929 - ten years before their desired target date. Sam and Daniel are killed in the firefight, and only Mitchell passes through the Stargate. Teal'c, mortally wounded, blows himself and Qetesh up. After a decade of waiting, Mitchell stows away on the ''Achilles'' and kills Ba'al and his troops when they come aboard through the Stargate.\n\nIn the now-restored timeline, SG-1, completely unaware of the previous events, watch the extraction proceed without incident. On Earth, Daniel wonders what Ba'al meant by his fail-safe.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:SG-Continuum.jpg|thumb|Ben Browder and Amanda Tapping on location in the Arctic]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Browder]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron \"Cam\" Mitchell]] and Mitchell's grandfather, the captain of the ''Achilles'' <!-- regardless of the films credits he is shown to be a full Colonel in the F-15 scenes -->\n* [[Amanda Tapping]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]  [[Samantha Carter|Samantha \"Sam\" Carter]] <!-- also shown to be a full Colonel in the F-15 scenes -->\n* [[Christopher Judge]] as [[Teal'c]]\n* [[Michael Shanks]] as Dr. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]]\n* [[Claudia Black]] as [[Vala Mal Doran]] and [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Qetesh|Qetesh]]\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Hank Landry (Stargate SG-1)|Henry \"Hank\" Landry]]\n* [[Richard Dean Anderson]] as [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] (& [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]]) [[Jack O'Neill|Jonathan \"Jack\" O'Neill]] <!-- Neither the credits nor any scene is more specific than \"General\" -->\n* [[Cliff Simon]] as [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]]\n* [[Peter Williams (actor)|Peter Williams]] as [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]\n* [[Don S.

Some scenes for this film were already shot at the end of March 2007, but the original start date was set for May 22, 2007 at [[Vancouver]]'s Bridge Studios. The production budget was {{US$|7 million}} (equivalent to about ${{inflation|US|7|2007}}M in {{inflation/year|US}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/tapping_discusses_isg-1i_movies.shtml |title=Tapping discusses SG-1 movies |date=August 9, 2007 |work=GateWorld|access-date=August 7, 2009}}</ref> Due to the postponement of this film until [[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)|the 5th season]] of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' was airing, there is a continuity error with Carter and Mitchell's rank. In the ending credits they are listed as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonels]].  However, when they fly the F-15s they are each wearing the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].  This is due to the fact that during filming producers realized that the film would probably be released after Carter had been promoted on ''Atlantis''. In the season&nbsp;5 premiere of that show, Sam, already a colonel, leaves [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] to attend the extraction, thus setting this film about a year after ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visimag.com/tvzone/t232_feat01.htm |author=Paul Spragg |title=Cam-Do Attitude |date=November 2008 |work=TV Zone |access-date=November 13, 2009 |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209022516/http://visimag.com/tvzone/t232_feat01.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Alexandria (SSN 757) ice.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Alexandria|SSN-757}} after surfacing through {{convert|2|ft|spell=in}} of ice during ICEX-07]]\nThe original draft for the film started with a view of the [[Tok'ra]] city, but Brad Wright eventually decided that the film should start in [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) to show what SG-1 represented. When writing lines for the character [[Jack O'Neill]], Wright tried to write lines that felt \"natural\" and not \"forced,\" saying it was of major importance. The inclusion of many [[list of Stargate SG-1 characters|recurring characters]] from the series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' was decided on to make old fans feel more \"welcome\" to the new film. The unnamed Captain of the ''Achilles''{{'}} [[cadaver|dead body]] was originally supposed to be revealed when SG-1 travelled back to [[Earth]]; Wright commented on the case, calling it \"gross\". [[Richard Dean Anderson]] was not supposed to appear at the start of the film, where he was killed. According to Wright, he was only set to appear in the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] in [[Antarctica]] because that's what Wright \"asked him to do.\"<ref name=\"audiocommentary\">{{cite video |people=[[Martin Wood (director)|Wood, Martin]] and [[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]] |date=2008 |title=Audio Commentary for \"Stargate: Continuum\" |medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to a scheduling conflict, actor [[Michael Shanks]] was unavailable to shoot the scenes in the Arctic. However, Jackson was on the boat with [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[Samantha Carter]] in the preceding scenes. In order to make his disappearance plausible, Wright decided that Jackson would develop frostbite after stepping in water and be unable to continue with the others. When commenting on the [[dialogue|dialogue scenes]], Wright commented that scenes like that would be \"cut off\" because of the time constraints in the ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' episodes, and further commented that they could keep these scenes since the film is \"longer\" than the episodes.<ref name=\"audiocommentary\"/>\n\n[[File:Amanda-Tapping.jpg|thumb|Amanda Tapping in costume on location in the Arctic]]\nThe film includes scenes filmed at the U.S. Navy's [[Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station]] in the Arctic, {{convert|200|nmi}} north of [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]].
