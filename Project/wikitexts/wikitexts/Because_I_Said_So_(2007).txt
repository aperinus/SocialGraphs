It was released on February 2, 2007. It was panned by critics, calling it the worst movie of the year.\n\n==Plot==\nDaphne ([[Diane Keaton]]), is the loving but over-bearing mother of three women. Her other daughters Maggie ([[Lauren Graham]]) and Mae ([[Piper Perabo]]) are happily married, but her youngest daughter Milly ([[Mandy Moore]]) recently broke up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned.\n\nDaphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own, so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter. She finds a potential candidate, Jason ([[Tom Everett Scott]]), and tries to orchestrate a chance meeting of the two. The plan seems flawless until Milly finds her own date, guitarist Johnny ([[Gabriel Macht]]), who happens to be a candidate Daphne rejected before. Milly is unaware of her mother's scheming and begins relationships with both Jason and Johnny at the same time, with neither aware of the other.\n\nInevitably, this double-dating takes its toll and Milly becomes estranged from both Jason and Johnny. Meanwhile, Daphne stumbles upon her own perfect match after being alone for many years and begins to challenge her search for the perfect match for Milly. Milly also realizes she has a choice to be the daughter her mother wants her to be, or to be the woman she wants herself to be. Choosing the latter, which comes with a row with her mother, leads her to reconcile with Johnny, a relationship Daphne has realized she should have tried to orchestrate in the first place.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Daphne\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Milly\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Johnny\n* [[Tom Everett Scott]] as Jason\n* [[Lauren Graham]] as Maggie\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Mae\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Joe\n}}\n\n==Marketing==\nThe film has a marketing tie-in allowing customers to buy panties with different sayings from the movie.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.custom-panties.com/productDetail.jsp?productid=customBISS\n| title=Because I Said So\n| publisher=Custom-Panties.com\n| accessdate=February 14, 2008\n| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213153213/http://custom-panties.com/productDetail.jsp?productid=customBISS\n| archive-date=February 13, 2008\n| url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nIn its first weekend of release, the film placed second in total box office receipts.
