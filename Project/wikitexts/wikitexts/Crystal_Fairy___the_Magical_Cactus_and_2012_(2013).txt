In a moment of indiscretion, he invites another young American, the eccentric \"Crystal Fairy\", to join him and his three Chilean companions, brothers who \u2014 with varying degrees of enthusiasm \u2014 also seek the magical herb. To the dismay of all four men, the [[New Age]]-addled young woman \u2014 now dubbed \"Crystal Hairy\" \u2014 joins them on their road trip, and soon everyone's patience is stretched thin. The desired plant is acquired through a hasty theft and the heartfelt experiences that they all undergo under its [[psychotropic]] influence on a remote desert beach bring them closer together.

[[Sebasti\u00e1n Silva (director)|Sebasti\u00e1n Silva]] had given her a brief character description during a phone call about a week before she left for Chile. Hoffmann says, \"And all he did was say, 'Go buy some books about [[2012 prophecy|2012]] and get on the plane.'\" The actors spent a week in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in pre-production living together at Silva's parents' house\u2014where he had shot ''[[The Maid (2009 film)|The Maid]]'' in 2009. The boys would sit out back playing guitar and singing songs. Hoffmann recalls hearing the music streaming through the open doors while Sebasti\u00e1n and Hoffmann would sit at a desk where she created all Crystal Fairy's drawings in the sketchbook she has in the film.<ref name=\"Movielinepress\"/>\n\nThe titular character is based on a real person who was an influence on the director.<ref name=\"Movielinepress\"/> The script was an outline with every scene including a moment that leads the actors to the next place. They didn't do any rehearsals in character, but since the boys had already been living together when Hoffmann arrived, her character's role as the outsider was easier to slip into.<ref name=\"Movielinepress\"/> While shooting the scene of Crystal Fairy [[Psychedelic experience|tripping]], Hoffmann was actually under the influence of real psychedelics, saying \"...I just knew it would be okay. My dose was weak, so I had to take a second one even though it was so revolting, but I really loved it. I was totally present in the experience of the making of the movie, and I felt like it was subtle enough that I could step in and out of it,\" Hoffmann said. \"I never felt like, 'Oh my God, I\u2019m tripping and I have to make a movie.' I felt like I could totally step out of it and be like, 'Okay, Sebasti\u00e1n, what's going on? What do we need to do?' And then I could step back into it and just go with it. And, you know, there's like hours and hours of footage that you don\u2019t see because it was like a 10-hour trip and we were in that desert the whole time.
