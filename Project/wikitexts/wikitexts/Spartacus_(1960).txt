One of these, a proud and gifted [[Thrace|Thracian]] named Spartacus, is so uncooperative in his position in a mining pit that he is sentenced to death by starvation. By chance, he is displayed to unctuous Roman businessman Lentulus Batiatus, who \u2013 impressed by his ferocity \u2013 purchases Spartacus for his gladiatorial school, where he instructs trainer Marcellus to not overdo his indoctrination because he thinks \"he has quality\". Amid the abuse, Spartacus forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman named Varinia, whom he refuses to rape when she is sent to \"entertain\" him in his cell. Spartacus and Varinia are subsequently forced to endure numerous humiliations for defying the conditions of servitude.\n\nBatiatus receives a visit from the immensely wealthy Roman senator [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], who aims to become dictator of the stagnant republic. Crassus buys Varinia on a whim, and for the amusement of his companions arranges for Spartacus and three others to fight to the death. When Spartacus is disarmed, his opponent, an [[Ethiopia]]n named Draba, spares his life in a burst of defiance and attacks the Roman audience, but is killed by an arena guard and Crassus. The next day, with the [[ludus gladiatorius|ludus]]' atmosphere still tense over this episode, Batiatus takes Varinia away to Crassus's house in Rome. Spartacus kills Marcellus, who was taunting him over his affections, and their fight escalates into a riot. The gladiators overwhelm their guards and escape into the Italian countryside.\n\nSpartacus is elected chief of the fugitives and decides to lead them out of [[Italy]] and back to their homes. They plunder Roman country estates as they go, collecting enough money to buy sea transport from Rome's foes, the pirates of [[Cilicia]]. Countless other slaves join the group, making it as large as an army. One of the new arrivals is Varinia, who escaped while being delivered to Crassus. Another is a slave entertainer named Antoninus, who also fled Crassus's service after Crassus insinuated that he expected Antoninus to become his sex slave. Privately, Spartacus feels mentally inadequate because of his lack of education during years of servitude. However, he proves an excellent leader and organizes his diverse followers into a tough and self-sufficient community. Varinia, now his informal wife, becomes pregnant by him, and he also comes to regard the spirited Antoninus as a sort of son.\n\nThe [[Roman Senate]] becomes increasingly alarmed as Spartacus defeats the multiple armies it sends against him. Crassus's populist opponent Gracchus knows that his rival will try to use the crisis as a justification for seizing control of the Roman army. To try to prevent this, Gracchus channels as much military power as possible into the hands of his own ''prot\u00e9g\u00e9'', a young senator named Julius Caesar. Although Caesar lacks Crassus's contempt for the lower classes of Rome, he mistakes the man's rigid outlook for nobility. Thus, when Gracchus reveals that he has bribed the Cilicians to get Spartacus out of Italy and rid Rome of the slave army, Caesar regards such tactics as beneath him and goes over to Crassus.\n\nCrassus uses a bribe of his own to make the pirates abandon Spartacus, and has the Roman army secretly force the rebels away from the coastline towards Rome. Amid panic that Spartacus means to sack the city, the Senate gives Crassus absolute power. Now surrounded by Romans, Spartacus persuades his men to die fighting. Just by rebelling and proving themselves human, he says that they have struck a blow against slavery. In the ensuing battle, after initially breaking the ranks of Crassus's legions, the slave army ends up trapped between Crassus and two other forces advancing from behind, and most of them are massacred. Afterward, the Romans try to locate the rebel leader for special punishment by offering a pardon (and return to enslavement) if the men will identify Spartacus, living or dead. Every surviving man responds by shouting \"I'm Spartacus!\". As a result, Crassus has them all sentenced to death by [[crucifixion]] along the [[Via Appia]] between Rome and [[Capua]], where the revolt began.\n\nMeanwhile, Crassus has found Varinia and Spartacus's newborn son and has taken them prisoner. He is disturbed by the idea that Spartacus can command more love and loyalty than he can, and hopes to compensate by making Varinia as devoted to him as she was to her former husband. When she rejects him, he furiously seeks out Spartacus (whom he recognizes from having watched him at Batiatus' school) and forces him to fight Antoninus to the death. The survivor is to be crucified, along with all the other men captured after the great battle. Spartacus kills Antoninus to spare him this terrible fate. The incident leaves Crassus worried about Spartacus's potential to live in legend as a [[martyr]]. In other matters, he is also worried about Caesar, who he senses will someday eclipse him.\n\nGracchus, having seen Rome fall into tyranny, commits suicide. Before doing so, he bribes his friend Batiatus to rescue Spartacus's family from Crassus and carry them away to freedom. On the way out of Rome, the group passes under Spartacus's cross. Varinia is able to comfort him in his dying moments by showing him his little son, who will grow up free and knowing who his father was.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as [[Spartacus]]\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Varinia\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as Gracchus\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Lentulus Batiatus|Batiatus]]\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Antoninus\n* [[John Gavin]] as [[Julius Caesar]]\n* [[John Dall]] as Marcus Glabrus\n* [[Nina Foch]] as Helena Glabrus\n* [[John Ireland]] as [[Crixus]]\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Tigranes Levantus (pirate envoy)\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Marcellus\n* [[Joanna Barnes]] as Claudia Marius\n* [[Harold J.

Douglas had worked with Wyler before on ''[[Detective Story (1951 film)|Detective Story]]'', and was disappointed when Wyler chose [[Charlton Heston]], instead. Shortly after, Edward (Eddie) Lewis, a vice president in Douglas's film company, Bryna Productions (named after Douglas's mother), had Douglas read Howard Fast's novel, ''Spartacus'', which had a related theme\u2014an individual who challenges the might of the Roman Empire\u2014and Douglas was impressed enough to purchase an option on the book from Fast with his own finances. Universal Studios eventually agreed to finance the film after Douglas persuaded Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov to act in it. Olivier was also to direct the picture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on August 8, 1958 \u00b7 23|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/381097780/|access-date=2021-05-20|website=Newspapers.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Variety|url=http://archive.org/details/variety210-1958-05|title=Variety (May 1958)|date=1958|publisher=New York, NY: Variety Publishing Company|others=Media History Digital Library}}</ref> Lewis became the producer of the film, with Douglas taking executive producer credit.

Douglas's intervention on his behalf was praised as an act of courage.\n\nIn his autobiography, Douglas states that this decision was motivated by a meeting that Edward Lewis, Stanley Kubrick, and he had regarding whose names to list for the screenplay in the film credits, given Trumbo's shaky position with Hollywood executives. One idea was to credit Lewis as co-writer or sole writer, but Lewis vetoed both suggestions. Kubrick then suggested that his own name be used. Douglas and Lewis found Kubrick's eagerness to take credit for Trumbo's work revolting, and the next day, Douglas called the gate at Universal saying, \"I'd like to leave a pass for Dalton Trumbo.\" Douglas writes, \"For the first time in 10 years, [Trumbo] walked on to a studio lot. He said, 'Thanks, Kirk, for giving me back my name.'{{-\"}}<ref name=\"Douglas autobio\" />\n\nBlacklisting effectively ended in 1960, when it lost credibility.

Douglas fired Mann at the end of the first week of shooting, during which the opening sequence in the quarry had been filmed. \"He seemed scared of the scope of the picture,\" wrote Douglas in his autobiography, yet a year later, Mann would embark on another epic of similar size, ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]''.

He had already directed four feature films (including ''[[Paths of Glory]]'', also starring Douglas). ''Spartacus'' was a bigger project by far, with a budget of $12 million (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|12|1959|r=0}}}}{{nbsp}}million in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}) and a cast of 10,500, a daunting project for such a young director. ''Paths of Glory'', his previous film, had only been budgeted at $935,000. Kubrick immediately fired Sabine Bethmann, who had only worked two days on the film. He and Douglas felt that she wasn't right for the role, so she was paid $3,000 to go home.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/414107/Spartacus/notes.html| title = Spartacus (1960) \u2013 Notes \u2013 TCM.com| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170930224318/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/414107/Spartacus/notes.html| archive-date = September 30, 2017}}</ref> Bethmann was replaced with Jean Simmons, who had been campaigning for the role. Douglas had originally chosen to cast Bethmann over Simmons because he imagined Varinia having a strikingly different accent from the aristocratic Romans, who were to be played mostly by actors with British accents. Simmons was fortunately still available and took over the role in the film with only a day's notice.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n''Spartacus'' was filmed using the [[35mm movie film|35-mm]] [[Technirama|Super 70 Technirama]] format<ref>{{cite web|last=Hauerslev|first=Thomas|title=Super Technirama 70 |url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/process/technirama/index.htm |publisher=In 70 MM.com|access-date=September 2, 2013}}</ref> and then blown up to [[70 mm film]]. This was a change for Kubrick, who preferred using the standard [[List of film formats|spherical format]]. This process allowed him to achieve ultra-high definition and to capture large panoramic scenes. Kubrick had wanted to shoot the picture in Rome with cheap extras and resources, but [[Edward Muhl]], president of Universal Pictures, wanted to make an example of the film and prove that a successful epic could be made in Hollywood itself, and \"stem the flood of 'runaway' producers heading for Europe\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=3}} A compromise was reached by filming the intimate scenes in Hollywood, and the battle scenes, at Kubrick's request, in Spain. Kubrick found working outdoors or in real locations to be distracting, and he believed the actors would benefit more from working on a sound stage, where they could fully concentrate. To create the illusion of the large crowds that play such an essential role in the film, Kubrick's crew used three-channel sound equipment to record 76,000 spectators at a [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] [[college football]] game shouting \"Hail, Crassus!\" and \"I'm Spartacus!\"\n\nThe battle scenes were filmed on a vast plain outside [[Madrid]]. About 8,000 trained soldiers from the [[Spanish Army|Spanish infantry]] were used to double as the Roman army. Kubrick directed the armies from the top of specially constructed towers. However, he eventually had to cut all but one of the gory battle scenes, due to negative audience reactions at [[test screening]]s. So precise was Kubrick, that even in arranging the bodies of the slaughtered slaves he had each \"corpse\" assigned with a number and instructions.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=69}} Shooting locations also included the countryside near Guadalajara and [[Iri\u00e9pal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viajes.nationalgeographic.com.es/promociones/guadalajara-ruta-por-rodajes-peliculas_13289|website=[[National Geographic]]|title=Guadalajara: una ruta por rodajes de pel\u00edculas|date=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisputes broke out during the filming. Cinematographer [[Russell Metty]], a veteran with experience working in big pictures such as [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' (1946) and ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958) and [[Howard Hawks]]'s ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938),{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=4}} complained about Kubrick's unusually precise and detailed instructions for the film's camerawork, and disagreed with Kubrick's use of light. On one occasion, he threatened to quit to Ed Muhl, to which Kubrick told him: \"You can do your job by sitting in your chair and shutting up. I'll be the director of photography.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=6}}  Metty later muted his criticisms after winning the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=61}} Kubrick wanted to shoot at a slow pace of two camera set-ups a day, but the studio insisted that he do 32; a compromise of eight had to be made.{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=3}} Kubrick and Trumbo fought constantly over the screenplay. Kubrick complained that the character of Spartacus had no faults or quirks.{{sfn|Winkler|2007|p=4}}\n\nDespite the film being a huge box-office success, gaining four Oscars, and being considered to rank among the very best of historical epics, Kubrick later distanced himself from it. Although his personal mark is a distinct part of the final picture, his contract did not give him complete control over the filming, the only occasion he did not exercise such control over one of his films.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guthmann |first=Edward |title=The Ones That (Almost) Got Away: Three films director Stanley Kubrick didn't want viewers to see |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/The-Ones-That-Almost-Got-Away-Three-films-2918428.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=September 2, 2013 |date=July 18, 1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe original score for ''Spartacus'' was composed and conducted by six-time [[Academy Award]]-nominee [[Alex North]]. It was nominated by the [[American Film Institute]] for their list of greatest film scores. It is a textbook example of how [[Modernism (music)|modernist compositional]] styles can be adapted to the Hollywood ''[[leitmotif]]'' technique. North's score is epic, as befits the scale of the film. After extensive research of music of that period, North gathered a collection of antique instruments, while not authentically Roman, that provided a strong dramatic effect. These instruments included a [[sarrusophone]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Israeli recorder]], [[Suona|Chinese oboe]], [[lute]], [[mandolin]], Yugoslav flute, [[Kithara|kythara]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]], and [[bagpipes]]. North's prize instrument was the [[ondioline]], similar to an earlier version of the electronic [[synthesizer]], which had never been used in film before. Much of the music is written without a [[Tonic (music)#Tone center|tonal center]], or flirts with tonality in ways that most film composers would not risk. One theme is used to represent both slavery and freedom, but is given different values in different scenes, so that it sounds like different themes. The love theme for Spartacus and Varinia is the most accessible theme in the film, and  a harsh trumpet figure was created for Crassus.\n\nA soundtrack album was released on LP in 1960, containing selections from the score totaling 41 minutes. This album was released on CD in 1990, to coincide with the film's restoration. Soon after, Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records attempted to re-record 75 minutes of highlights from the score personally chosen by North, to be conducted by his friend and fellow film composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], but the project was delayed multiple times and remained unrecorded when Goldsmith died in 2004.\n\nIn 2010, Var\u00e8se Sarabande released a limited collector's edition of 5,000 copies, containing six CDs, one DVD, and a 168-page booklet. The first disc contained all 72 minutes of the score that survive in stereo, including all music from the 1960 album. Discs two and three featured the entire score to the film, in mono. Disc four contained alternate and preliminary cues from the original recording sessions. Discs five and six contained re-recordings of the film's iconic love theme, adapted by numerous modern film composers and other musicians. The DVD contained a documentary interviewing those same musicians about the score's impact.<ref>Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records: [http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-14/Spartacus/Detail \"Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012150949/http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-14/Spartacus/Detail |date=October 12, 2010 }} October 11, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Political commentary, Christianity, and reception ===\nThe film parallels 1950s American history, specifically [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) hearings and the [[civil rights movement]]. The HUAC hearings, where witnesses were pressured to \"name names\" of communists and communist  sympathizers, mirror the climactic scene as the defeated slaves, ordered by Crassus to identify their leader from the multitude, individually stand up and proclaim, \"I'm Spartacus\". Howard Fast, author of the original novel, had written ''Spartacus'' while in prison for refusal to name names to HUAC investigators.{{sfn|Burgoyne|2008|p=93}} At the beginning of the scene when Draba sacrifices himself by attacking Crassus rather than kill Spartacus, the film's narrator comments that slavery was a central issue in American history. The fight to end segregation and to extend equality to African Americans is symbolized in the racial mixing in the gladiatorial school, as well as in the army of Spartacus, where all must battle for freedom.{{sfn|Burgoyne|2008|pp=86\u201390}} Another allusion to the political situation in the United States is hinted at in the beginning, when Rome is described as a republic \"fatally stricken with a disease called human slavery\", describing Spartacus as a \"proud, rebellious son dreaming of the death of slavery, 2000 years before it finally would die\". Thus an ethical and political vision becomes a philosophical framework for the ensuing action.{{sfn|Burgoyne|2008|p=73}}\n\nThe introductory voice-over also describes Rome as destined to collapse with the rise of [[Christianity]]:\n\n<blockquote>In the last century before the birth of the new faith called Christianity, which was destined to overthrow the pagan tyranny of Rome and bring about a new society, the Roman Republic stood at the very center of the civilized world. \"Of all things fairest\" sang the poet, \"First among cities and home of the Gods is Golden Rome.\" Yet even at the zenith of her pride and power, the Republic lay fatally stricken with the disease called human slavery. The age of the dictator was at hand, waiting in shadows for the event to bring it forth. In that same century, in the conquered Greek province of Thrace, an illiterate slave woman added to her master's wealth by giving birth to a son whom she names Spartacus. A proud, rebellious son, who was sold to living death in the mines of Libya, before his 13th birthday. There, under whip and chain and sun, he lived out his youth and his young manhood, dreaming the death of slavery 2000 years before it finally would die.</blockquote>\n\nThus, Rome is described as an oppressive state suffering from its own excesses in the years before the adoption of Christian beliefs begins to end Roman oppression and slavery.<ref>{{cite book |last=Theodorakopoulos |first=Elena |title=Ancient Rome at the Cinema: Story and Spectacle in Hollywood and Rome |pages=54\u201355 |publisher=[[Bristol Phoenix]] |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-904675-28-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film's release was occasioned applause from the mainstream media, it sparked protest from right-wing and anticommunist groups such as the [[National Legion of Decency]], which picketed theaters exhibiting the film. The controversy over its \"legitimacy as an expression of national aspirations\" continued until newly elected US President [[John F.
