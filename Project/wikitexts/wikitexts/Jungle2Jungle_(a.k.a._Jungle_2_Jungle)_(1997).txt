It is an American remake of the 1994 French film ''[[Un indien dans la ville]]'' (also known as ''Little Indian, Big City''). Its plot follows that of the original film fairly closely, with the biggest difference being the change in location from [[Paris]] to [[New York City]].\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Cromwell is a self-absorbed [[commodity broker|commodities broker]] living in [[New York City]]. Wanting to marry his new fianc\u00e9e, Charlotte, he needs to obtain a divorce from his first wife, Patricia, who left him some years earlier. She now lives with a semi-Westernized tribe in [[Canaima National Park]], [[Venezuela]]. He travels there to get her signature on the divorce papers, but upon arriving, she reveals that they had a son together, who is now 13 years old and named Mimi-Siku.\n\nMichael attempts to bond with Mimi in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York City \"[[coming of age|when he is a man]]\". He is also given a new name of \"Baboon\" as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi undergoes the traditional [[rite of passage]] of the tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives him a special task to bring fire from the [[Statue of Liberty]] in order to become the next chief. A reluctant Michael, realizing his promise would have to be honored sooner than he realized, brings Mimi to New York City with him.\n\nCharlotte is less than pleased about Mimi and his primitive ways. As Michael attempts to adapt him to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when he reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the torch, he is disappointed when he sees that the flame is not real. After a brief argument with Michael, Mimi's antics have caused Charlotte to reach her breaking point.\n\nWhile staying at the home of Michael's business partner Richard Kempster, Mimi falls in love with his daughter, Karen. He paints her face and gives her a new name, Ukume, as is the custom in his tribe. Richard resents Mimi's presence in his home due to his influence over Karen and because he cooked and ate his valuable prize-winning [[Sailfin molly|Poecilia latipinna]] fish. Richard freaks out when he sees Karen and Mimi together in a [[hammock]] and threatens to send her to an all-girls [[summer camp]].\n\nThe Kempsters and Michael are targeted by Alexei Jovanovic, a [[Russian mafia|Russian mobster]] and caviar dealer who believes that they have cheated him in a business deal. He arrives at the Kempsters' home and tortures Richard for information, and is prepared to cut off his fingers. By fighting together, utilizing Mimi's hunting skills, and Mimi's pet tarantula Maitika, Michael and Mimi fight off Jovanovic's group.\n\nBefore returning to the Amazon jungle, Mimi is given a satellite phone by Michael so they can stay in touch. He also presents him with a Statue of Liberty cigarette lighter, which produces fire from the torch and will fulfill his quest. In return, he gives Michael a [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] and poisoned darts, telling him to practice and come to see him when he can hit flies.\n\nShortly afterward, Michael finds himself disheartened by the rat-race and realizes that his relationship with Charlotte is not working for him anymore. He attempts to kill a fly with his blowpipe on the trading floor of the [[New York Board of Trade]]. He hits it, but also his hot-tempered boss Langston ([[Bob Dishy]]) who collapses asleep on the trading floor.\n\nMichael returns to Lipo-Lipo to see Mimi and Patricia, bringing the Kempsters with him for a vacation. Karen and Mimi are reunited and it is suggested that Michael and Patricia also resume their relationship.\n\nAs the closing credits start rolling, Michael undergoes the rite of passage as Mimi did earlier.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Michael Cromwell\n* [[Martin Short]] as Richard Kempster \n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Mimi-Siku Cromwell\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Charlotte\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Alexei Jovanovic\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Dr. Patricia Cromwell\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Morrison\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Jan Kempster\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Karen Kempster\n* [[Luis Avalos]] as Abe\n* [[Frankie J.

The site's consensus states: \"Tim Allen spends ''Jungle 2 Jungle'' annoyed and put upon, mirroring audiences' reaction as they struggle through this witless family comedy.\"<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite Rotten Tomatoes |type=movie |id=jungle_2_jungle |title=Jungle 2 Jungle |access-date=October 4, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] was disappointed by the film, giving it one star out of four, a small step from his original zero star rating for ''[[Un indien dans la ville|Little Indian, Big City]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-10-31|title=Jungle 2 Jungle Movie Review & Film Summary (1997) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031050926/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jungle-2-jungle-1997|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970307/REVIEWS/703070301/1023|archive-date=2015-10-31|access-date=2021-10-08|website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> On his television program ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]]'', Ebert said ''Jungle 2 Jungle'' was not as bad as ''Little Indian, Big City'' because it was \"far too mediocre to be terrible.\" He also described it as \"lamebrained, boring, predictable, long, and slow\", and added that while the French version was memorably bad, ''Jungle 2 Jungle'' was \"just forgettable\". Ebert's colleague [[Gene Siskel]] mildly disagreed, specifying that he felt ''Jungle 2 Jungle'' was just as bad as ''Little Indian, Big City''. He also said he felt embarrassed for Allen and Short, as he felt they were used far better in other television programs and films.<ref>{{YouTube|lu0p4VpG2JM|Siskel &amp; Ebert - Jungle 2 Jungle (1997)}}</ref> Siskel later went on to declare ''Jungle 2 Jungle'' the worst film of 1997.<ref>{{YouTube|Gat4mFu0whE|Siskel and Ebert, At The Movies: Worst Movies of 1997}} Retrieved April 5, 2013</ref>\n\nAt the [[1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]], the film was listed as one of 30 dishonorable mentions for Worst Picture and was noted under the Founders Award, which lamented the year's biggest studio disgraces. Referencing Siskel's pick for worst film of the year (they called it \"a horrendous embarrassment for Disney\"), the Stinkers stated that it had \"just as many laughs as ''Little Indian, Big City'' (zero) and we're being generous\" and added that Disney needed to stop remaking so many films.<ref>{{cite web |title=1997's Biggest Studio Disgraces |url=http://thestinkers.com/founders_award.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991010130006/http://thestinkers.com/founders_award.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 October 1999 |website=The Stinkers |access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack consists of 14 songs with a total time of 50:20.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jungle 2 Jungle Soundtrack|url=https://www.moviemusic.com/soundtrack/M00878/jungle2jungle/|website=moviemusic.com|access-date=May 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320045628/https://www.moviemusic.com/soundtrack/M00878/jungle2jungle/|archive-date=March 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Track listing===\n{{div-col|colwidth=25em}}\n# [[Maxi Priest]] - \"It Starts In The Heart\" (4:44)\n# [[Peter Gabriel]]/[[Youssou N'Dour]]/[[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] - \"Shaking The Tree\" (5:34)\n# Dana Hutson - \"It's My Life\" (3:29)\n# [[Jam Nation]] - \"Awakening\" (2:52)\n# [[Joseph Arthur]] - \"Big City Secret\" (4:37)\n# The Sha-Shees - \"You Can Do It\" (3:53)\n# Rique Pantoja - \"By The Sea\" (3:48)\n# [[Toto la Momposina|Toto La Momposina Y Sus Tambores]] - \"La Sombra Negra\" (3:25)\n# \"Between Two Worlds\" (2:16)\n# George Acogny - \"Fire Dance/Ceremony Chant\" (2:25)\n# [[Eyuphuro]] - \"Akatswela\" (4:47)\n# [[Afro Celt Sound System]] - \"Whirl-Y-Reel I\" (3:32)\n# [[Toto la Momposina|Toto La Momposina Y Sus Tambores]] - \"Malanga\" (4:06)\n# \"New York Jungle\" (0:49)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==included clips== \n*''[[Disney Time]]'' (1997) On [[BBC1]] (Spider Chase From ''Jungle 2 Jungle'')\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/jungle-2-jungle}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119432|title=Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n* {{tcmdb title|324225|Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n* {{Amg movie|154704|Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n* {{mojo title|id=jungle2jungle|title=Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n\n{{John Pasquin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jungle 2 Jungle}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of French films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about father\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:Films about hunter-gatherers]]\n[[Category:Films about Native Americans]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Pasquin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Convertino]]\n[[Category:French films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Wall Street films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
