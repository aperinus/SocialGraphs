Night Shyamalan]], and starring [[James McAvoy]], [[Anya Taylor-Joy]], and [[Betty Buckley]]. The hit film follows a man with [[dissociative identity disorder]] who kidnaps and imprisons three teenage girls in an isolated underground facility.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on November 11, 2015, in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 26, 2016, and was released in the United States on January 20, 2017, by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. It received generally positive reviews; critics highly praised McAvoy's performance, and welcomed Shyamalan's direction. Some [[mental health]] advocates criticized the film for its stigmatization of [[mental illness]]. ''Split'' was a commercial success, grossing $278&nbsp;million worldwide on a budget of $9&nbsp;million.\n\n''Split'' is a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone sequel]] to Shyamalan's 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'' although not marketed as such, instead saving the revelation for a scene featuring [[Bruce Willis]] reprising his ''Unbreakable'' role in an uncredited cameo. Commentators dubbed ''Split'' the first-ever \"stealth sequel\", and the first solo [[supervillain]] origin film. The 2019 film ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', which combined the casts and characters of both previous films, concluded Shyamalan's [[Unbreakable (film series)|''Unbreakable'' trilogy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nKevin Wendell Crumb, a man struggling with [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID) rooted in his history of [[childhood abuse]] and abandonment, has been managing living with his 23 distinct personalities well for several years with help from his therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher. The most dominant of the desirable alters, \"Barry,\" has been in control of deciding which personalities get to control Kevin's body, and lately he has not allowed \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have a turn due to the former's tendency to harass young girls and the latter's belief in a mysterious entity called \"The Beast\" who plans to rid the world of the \"impure,\" that is, those who have not suffered. Dr. Fletcher is concerned when she realizes that \"Dennis\" has been impersonating \"Barry\" during their sessions after questioning him about an incident wherein Dennis had been left disturbed when two teenage girls had placed his hands on their breasts while drunk.\n\nJust outside [[Philadelphia]], Dennis kidnaps three girls \u2014 Claire, Casey and Marcia \u2014 when they are waiting in the car of Claire's father to get driven home from a birthday party. He imprisons the girls in a secret underground lair beneath the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where they meet Patricia, who protects the girls from Dennis to save them for \"The Beast,\" and a 9-year-old boy alter named \"Hedwig,\" revealed to be the true dominant alter, whom Patricia and Dennis are manipulating to shut out the other alters. The girls try to escape by going through the vents, manipulating Kevin's alters, and communicating with another individual via a walkie-talkie, but all of their attempts end in failure.\n\nDr. Fletcher goes to the zoo to talk to Dennis when he claims to have made contact with \"The Beast,\" in reality a yet-to-manifest 24th personality, but she discovers Claire, so Dennis incapacitates the doctor and locks her up. Then he goes to the train station and boards an empty train car, where \"The Beast\" takes over. \"The Beast,\" who displays enhanced strength and animalistic tendencies, returns to his lair, thanks Dr. Fletcher for her help, and crushes her to death. He savagely feeds upon and kills Claire and Marcia before approaching Casey, but she calls out Kevin's full name, which brings forth his original personality. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control of his own body for two years, the horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden. This prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control, with Patricia the victor. She tells Casey that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away and will not awaken now even if his name is called.\n\nWhile Patricia returns control to \"The Beast,\" Casey retrieves the shotgun and a box of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] and escapes into a tunnel. She manages to shoot \"The Beast\" twice before running out of ammo, but he only sustains minor wounds. He moves closer to murder her, but stops when he sees scars across her abdomen and chest, which are related to her having been abused by her uncle and legal guardian, John, both before and after her father's death. Because she is \"pure,\" \"The Beast\" spares Casey's life, and she is rescued the next morning by the police.\n\nIn another hideout, Dennis, Patricia, and Hedwig discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world. At the Silk City Diner, several patrons watch a news report on \"The Beast's\" crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous alters have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier, who was also given a nickname. As she tries to remember it, the [[David Dunn (character)|man]] sitting next to her replies that it was \"[[Mr. Glass]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Beast: Kevin struggles to live with [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), which has developed to the point that he has 23 distinct personalities. They are so distinct that each is unaware of what happens when the others are in \"the light\" and they each have a unique body chemistry (Jade, for instance, is diabetic). A 24th personality, \"The Beast\", manifests that is a grotesque sociopath and insatiable cannibal with superhuman capabilities, such as inhuman bodily strength, enhanced speed and agility, and near-invulnerability. \"The Beast\" can even scale walls and stick to ceilings.\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Casey Cooke, a teenage girl with a traumatic past and a history of [[self-harm]] who is kidnapped by \"Dennis\", one of Kevin's personalities, to be sacrificed to \"The Beast\".\n** Izzie Coffey as 5-year-old Casey\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Karen Fletcher, a [[psychologist]] who attempts to help Kevin with his DID and to get the scientific community to recognize the extent to which DID can cause physiological changes.\n* [[Haley Lu Richardson]] as Claire Benoit, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Marcia who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to \"The Beast\".\n* [[Jessica Sula]] as Marcia, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Claire who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to \"The Beast\".\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Casey's father.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as John Cooke, Casey's paternal uncle.\n* [[Neal Huff]] as Mr. Benoit, Claire's father.\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as academic moderator.\n* [[M. Night Shyamalan]] as Jai, a security guard in Dr. Fletcher's apartment building.\n* Rosemary Howard as Penelope Crumb, Kevin's mother.\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]] (uncredited cameo)\n* [[Kim Director]] as Hannah (uncredited; scenes deleted)\n* [[Sterling K. Brown]] as Shaw (uncredited; scenes deleted)\n\n== Production ==\nShyamalan conceived the idea for ''Split'' years before he wrote the screenplay. He explained, \"In this case, I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in \u2013 humor and suspense.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=McKittrick |first=Christopher |date=January 20, 2017 |title='Power comes from writing.'

She said that, in contrast to McAvoy's character, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent, and research has shown they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. Movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, which, she said, can misrepresent a form of mental health that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]].\n\nIn a statement about the movie, the [[International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation]] (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in jail over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. In an open letter to Shyamalan, several activists said that \"''Split'' represents yet another gross parody of us based on fear, ignorance, and sensationalism, only much worse.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 28, 2016 |title=Open Letter to the Director |url=https://splitmoviehurts.com/letter-to-director/}}</ref>\n\nDr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie, and did not plan to, telling [[Healthline]]: \"What concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its [[etiology]] in the worst form of human suffering \u2013 the [[abuse]] of innocent children\". He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don't know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \"vilify and demonize mental illness in general, and DID in particular,\" the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.<ref>{{Cite web
