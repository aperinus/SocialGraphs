''[[Box Office Mojo]]''. Retrieved 2011-01-16.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Primal Fear''''' is a 1996 American [[legal thriller]] film directed by [[Gregory Hoblit]], based on [[William Diehl]]'s 1993 novel of the [[Primal Fear (novel)|same name]], and written by [[Steve Shagan]] and [[Ann Biderman]]. It stars [[Richard Gere]], [[Laura Linney]], [[John Mahoney]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Frances McDormand]] and [[Edward Norton]] in his film debut. The film revolves around a [[Chicago]] defense attorney who believes that his altar boy client is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic archbishop.\n\nThe film was a box office success and received positive reviews, with Norton's breakthrough performance earning critical praise. He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]].<ref>[http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/primal-fear Golden Globe Awards for 'Primal Fear'] Retrieved 2017-05-09.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMartin Vail is a [[Chicago]] defense attorney, who loves the spotlight on winning acquittals for high-profile clients on legal technicalities. He meets Janet Venable, a former lover and [[prosecutor]], who rejects his advances. Meanwhile, [[Archbishop]] Rushman, a beloved figure and head of Chicago's Catholic diocese, is ambushed and killed by Aaron Stampler, a 19-year-old [[Altar server|altar boy]] from [[Kentucky]], who is arrested by the police. Vail meets with Aaron in prison and offers to defend him [[pro bono]]. Aaron reveals that he had admired the archbishop. Vail believes that Aaron is innocent, being meek and with a severe [[Stuttering|stutter]]. Venable is assigned to prosecute him for capital murder.\n\nAs the trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt [[state's attorney]], John Shaughnessy, recently lost millions in [[real estate|real-estate]] investments, due to Rushman's decision to not develop church-owned land. Following a tip from Alex, a former altar boy, about a videotape involving Aaron, Vail steals the [[VHS]] cassette from the crime scene. The tape shows the archbishop forcing Aaron, his girlfriend Linda and another altar boy to engage in sexual acts. When Vail confronts Aaron and accuses him of having lied, he breaks down crying and uses his short name Roy, a violent [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] without a stutter. He confesses to the archbishop's death and becomes physically violent. He becomes passive and shy and with no recollection of the personality switch. \n\nMolly Arrington, the [[neuropsychologist]] examining Aaron, is convinced that he has [[dissociative identity disorder]], caused by years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father and Rushman. Vail is troubled by this information, because he cannot enter an [[Insanity defence|insanity plea]] in an ongoing trial. He decides whether to introduce the evidence that might elicit sympathy from the jury for Aaron, but could provide the motive that Venable cannot establish. He has the videotape anonymously delivered to the prosecution, knowing that she will realize who had sent it, as she is under intense pressure to deliver a guilty verdict and will use the tape as a proof of motive.\n\nIn the trial, Vail calls Aaron to the witness stand and questions him about the sexual abuse he had suffered at Rushman's hands. He introduces the evidence that Shaughnessy had covered it up and Rushman had molested another man. During Venable's harsh questioning and cross-examination, Aaron threatens to kill her, but he is subdued and returned to prison. The judge informs Vail and Venable that she intends to dismiss the jury in favor of a [[bench trial]], and will declare Aaron [[Insanity defence|not guilty by reason of insanity]], remanding him to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. Venable is fired for losing the case and for allowing Rushman\u2019s crimes to be publicly exposed, but it is implied that she will resume her relationship with Vail.\n\nVail visits Aaron in prison to inform him of the dismissal. Aaron claims to have no recollection of his violent reaction in the courtroom, but as Vail is leaving, he slips by asking him about Venable. When Vail confronts Aaron, he reveals that he had faked the personality disorder. No longer stuttering, he brags about killing Rushman and Linda. When Vail asks him if there was ever a Roy, he replies \"there was never an Aaron\". Stunned and disillusioned, Vail leaves the courthouse, as Aaron taunts him from his cell.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as defense attorney Martin Vail\n* [[Edward Norton]] as defendant Aaron Stampler / Roy\n* [[Laura Linney]] as prosecutor Janet Venable\n* [[John Mahoney]] as state's attorney Shaughnessy\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Judge Miriam Shoat\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Dr Molly Arrington\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Yancy\n* [[Andre Braugher]] as Vail's investigator Tommy Goodman\n* [[Steven Bauer]] as streetwise neighbor Joe Pinero\n* [[Joe Spano]] as Stenner\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Martinez\n* Azelea Davila as victim Linda\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Archbishop Rushman\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Vail's assistant Naomi\n* [[Jon Seda]] as former altar boy Alex\n}}\n\nSeveral Chicago television news personalities appear in cameos as themselves as they deliver reports about the case, including [[WLS-TV|WLS]]'s [[Diann Burns]] and [[Linda Yu]], [[WBBM-TV]]'s [[Mary Ann Childers]], [[Lester Holt]] and [[Jon Duncanson]] and [[WGN-TV]]'s [[Bob Jordan (newscaster)|Bob Jordan]] and [[Randy Salerno]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack includes the Portuguese [[fado]] song \"[[Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Mar]]\" sung by [[Dulce Pontes]].\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 77% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.
