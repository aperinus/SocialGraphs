He plans to steal $2 million from the money-counting room of a [[racetrack]] during a featured race. Johnny assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop, a betting window teller to gain access to the backroom, a [[sharpshooter]] to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd and keep the winnings from being paid out, a wrestler to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender.\n\nGeorge Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he made when they married, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will impress her and keep her from leaving him. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon to steal the money from George and his associates.\n\nThe heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by a security guard. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears with an associate to hold them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George emerges as the only man standing. He goes home and shoots Sherry before collapsing.\n\nOn his way to the apartment Johnny sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find and struggles to stuff all the money in. At the airport, Johnny and Fay  must check the oversized bag as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While the couple waits to board the plane the suitcase falls off a baggage cart onto the runway, breaks open, and its loose banknotes are swept away by the gusts from the aircraft's propellers.\n\nFay and Johnny seek to flee, but are unable to hail a cab before the police are alerted to them. Fay urges Johnny to escape.  Instead, he refuses, calmly accepting the futility of trying to escape.  Muttering \"What's the difference?\", he is approached by two officers seeking to arrest him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Johnny Clay\n* [[Coleen Gray]] as Fay\n* [[Vince Edwards]] as Val Cannon\n* [[Jay C.

Harris]], who was looking for a young new talent to produce for, having sold his film distribution company. Harris considered Kubrick to be \"the most intelligent, most creative person [he had] ever come in contact with\", and the two formed the Harris-Kubrick Pictures Corporation in 1955.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=37}}  Harris purchased the rights to [[Lionel White]]'s novel ''Clean Break'' for $10,000, beating United Artists, which was interested in the film as a vehicle for [[Frank Sinatra]].{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=37}}  At Kubrick's suggestion they hired [[hardboiled]] fiction novelist [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] to write the script. United Artists told the pair that it would help finance the picture if Harris and Kubrick could find a high-profile actor to star. They signed [[Sterling Hayden]], who agreed to accept $40,000. However, Hayden wasn't a big enough star for UA, which wound up providing only $200,000 for the film; Harris financed the rest using $80,000 of his own money and a $50,000 loan from his father.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}}  The film was the first of three on which Harris and Kubrick collaborated as producer and director in a span of less than ten years.<ref name=\"tcmnotes\">{{cite web | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=17624&category=Notes | title=Notes for The Killing (1956) | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] | access-date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>  [[Working title]]s for the film were ''Clean Break'' and ''Bed of Fear''.<ref name=\"tcmnotes\" /> It was the last feature film completely filmed by Kubrick in the United States\u2014interiors for ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' were shot on [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] soundstages, but battle exteriors for that film were shot in [[Spain]].\n\nThree members of the cast\u2014Hayden, [[Ted de Corsia]] and [[Timothy Carey]]\u2014had appeared together the previous year in the low-budget noir film, ''[[Crime Wave (1954 film)|Crime Wave]]''. The art director, [[Ruth Sobotka]], was Kubrick's wife at the time.<ref name=\"tcmnotes\" /> Kubrick and Harris moved from New York to L.A. to shoot the picture, and Kubrick went unpaid during the shooting, surviving on loans from Harris. In addition to Hayden, Kubrick cast actors from ''film noirs'' he had liked, such as [[Timothy Carey]], [[Ted de Corsia]], [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] and [[Marie Windsor]]. He chose former professional wrestler and old chess friend [[Kola Kwariani]] to play an aging, chess-playing grappler.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}} The [[cinematographer]]'s union in Hollywood told Kubrick that he could not be both director and cinematographer, so veteran cinematographer [[Lucien Ballard]] was hired to shoot the picture. He and Kubrick clashed often during filming. On one occasion Kubrick favored a long tracking shot, with the camera close to the actors with a 25mm wide-angle lens to provide slight distortion of the image, but Ballard moved it further away and began using a 50mm lens. Kubrick sternly ordered him to put the camera back or he would be fired.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=38}}\n\n==Reception==\nWithout a proper release across the United States the film performed poorly at the box office.  In spite of a last minute promotion as a second feature to ''[[Bandido!]]'' (1956) it failed to turn a profit. However, it garnered critical acclaim, landing on several critical Top-Ten lists for the year. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrongly predicted that it would \"make a killing at the cash booths\"\u2014asserting that Kubrick \"has shown more audacity with dialogue and camera than Hollywood has seen since the obstreperous [[Orson Welles]] went riding out of town on an exhibitors' poll\"\u2014as the film recorded a loss of $130,000.<ref name=\"tino\">Balio, Tino.

In his opening remarks, Ebert writes, \"Stanley Kubrick considered ''The Killing'' (1956) to be his first mature feature, after a couple of short warm-ups. He was 28 when it was released, having already been an obsessed chess player, a photographer for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine and a director of ''[[The March of Time|March of Time]]'' newsreels. It's tempting to search here for themes and a style he would return to in his later masterpieces, but few directors seemed so determined to make every one of his films an individual, free-standing work. Seeing it without his credit, would you guess it was by Kubrick? Would you connect ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' with ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''?\"<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-killing-1956 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | date=January 12, 2012 | last=Ebert| first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert | title=The Killing (1956), Great Movies By Roger Ebert | access-date=August 10, 2013}}.
