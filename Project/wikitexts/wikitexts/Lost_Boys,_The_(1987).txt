The film's ensemble cast includes [[Corey Haim]], [[Jason Patric]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Jami Gertz]], [[Corey Feldman]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Billy Wirth]], [[Brooke McCarter]], [[Alex Winter]], [[Jamison Newlander]], and [[Barnard Hughes]].\n\nThe title is a reference to the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] in [[J. M. Barrie]]'s stories about [[Peter Pan]] and [[Neverland]], who, like vampires, never grow up. Most of the film was shot in [[Santa Cruz, California]].\n\n''The Lost Boys'' was released and produced by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on July 31, 1987 and was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $32 million against a production budget of $8.5 million. The success of the film has spawned a [[The Lost Boys (franchise)|franchise]] with two sequels (''[[Lost Boys: The Tribe]]'' and ''[[Lost Boys: The Thirst]]''), and two comic book series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2022}}\n[[Michael Emerson (The Lost Boys)|Michael Emerson]] and his younger brother Sam move with their recently divorced mother Lucy to the fictional small beach town of Santa Carla, California, to live with her eccentric father, Michael and Sam's grandfather. \n\nLucy gets a job at a video store owned by bachelor Max Lawrence. Michael becomes fascinated by Star, a beautiful girl he spots on the boardwalk, though she seems to be with the mysterious [[David (The Lost Boys)|David Powers]], the leader of a youth biker gang.\n\nIn the local comic book store, Sam meets brothers Edgar and Alan Frog, a pair of self-proclaimed vampire hunters. They give Sam horror comics to teach him about the undead threat they claim has infiltrated the town.\n\nThrough Star, Michael is drawn into the orbit of David's motorcycle gang. They challenge him with several tests of courage and soon offer him initiation into the gang. During a meal in their hangout, an abandoned luxury hotel sunken beneath the cliff by the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake|1906 earthquake]], Star warns Michael not to drink from an offered bottle, warning it is blood, but he ignores her advice. Soon thereafter, Michael begins to undergo a change; his eyes are sensitive to sunlight, the smell of food revolts him, and his reflection becomes partly transparent. He develops a craving for blood and attempts to attack his brother Sam, but is stopped by Sam's dog Nanook. \n\nSam is initially terrified, but Michael convinces him that he is not yet a vampire and desperately needs his help. Sam deduces that, as Michael has not yet killed, he is a \"half-vampire\" and his condition is reversible upon the head vampire's death. Sam and the Frog Brothers initially suspect Max of being the head vampire but after he passes their \"tests\" they focus on David.\n\nDavid tries to provoke Michael into killing but Michael repeatedly refuses. Star reveals that she and Laddie, the youngest of the gang, are also still partly human and that David had intended for Michael to be Star's first kill, sealing her fate as a vampire. \n\nMichael leads Sam and the Frog Brothers to the gang's lair. They impale one vampire, Marko Thompson, with a stake, awakening David and the others, but the boys escape, rescuing Star and Laddie. Realizing the gang will come after them that night, the teens arm themselves with holy-water-filled [[water guns]], a [[longbow]] and [[wikt:stake|wood stake]]s, barricading themselves in the house. When night falls, David's gang attacks. The Frog Brothers, Sam, and Nanook take out two of the gang while Michael and David battle each other. David is impaled, but there is no change in Michael, Star, or Laddie, forcing the group to conclude they still have not accounted for the master vampire.\n\nLucy and Max then return home from their date and Max is revealed to be the head vampire. Max explains that he had instructed David to turn Sam and Michael into vampires so that Lucy could not refuse to be transformed herself, as his objective had been to make Lucy mother for his lost boys.\n\nAs Max pulls Lucy to him, preparing to transform her, Grandpa crashes his truck through the wall of the house, impaling Max on a wooden fence post and causing him to explode. Michael, Star and Laddie then return to normal. Amongst the carnage and debris, Grandpa casually retrieves a drink from the refrigerator and declares: \"One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach: all the damn vampires.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jason Patric]] as [[Michael Emerson (character)|Michael Emerson]]\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Sam Emerson\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as [[David (The Lost Boys)|David Powers]]\n* [[Brooke McCarter]] as Paul Harris\n* [[Billy Wirth]] as Dwayne Stephens\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Marko Thompson\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Lucy Emerson\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Edgar Frog\n* [[Jamison Newlander]] as Alan Frog\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Star\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Max\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Grandpa\n* Chance Michael Corbitt as Laddie\n* Alexander Bacan Chapman as Greg\n* Nori Morgan as Shelly\n* [[Kelly Jo Minter]] as Maria\n* [[Tim Cappello]] as Saxophone Player\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nA March 5, 1985 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' news item announced that the independent production company ''[[Producers Sales Organization]]'' (PSO) bought first-time screenwriters Janice Fischer and James Jeremias's ''Lost Boys'' script for $400,000 on February 20, 1985.<ref name=\"afi\" /> PSO announced their acquisition of the project at ''[[American Film Market]]'' 1985.

Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' stories, who \u2013 like vampires \u2013 never grow old. According to Day, the central theme of ''The Lost Boys'', \"organised around loose allusions to Peter Pan\", is the tension surrounding the Emerson family and the world of contemporary adolescence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Day|first=William Patrick|title=Vampire Legends in Contemporary American Culture: What Becomes a Legend Most|publisher=UPK|location=United States|year=2002|page=29}}</ref> The film was originally set to be directed by [[Richard Donner]] and the screenplay, written by Janice Fischer and James Jeremias, was modelled on Donner's recent hit ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"indiewire1\">{{cite news| url=https://indiewire.com/2012/08/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-lost-boys-on-its-25th-anniversary-251374/| title=5 Things You Might Not Know About 'The Lost Boys' on Its 25th Anniversary| author=Oliver Lyttelton| publisher=indiewire.com| date=2012-08-01| access-date=2018-02-23}}</ref> In this way the film was envisioned as more of a juvenile vampire adventure with 13 or 14 year old vampires, while the Frog brothers were \"chubby 8 year-old Cub Scouts\" and the character of Star was a young boy.<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OryXT5-F2RY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/OryXT5-F2RY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live| title=The Lost Boys dvd promo| year=2004| publisher=YouTube| access-date=2018-02-17}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"indiewire1\"/> When Donner committed to other projects, Joel Schumacher was approached to direct the film although Donner eventually received credit as an executive producer.

Sutherland had just completed work on ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' when he was offered the role of David. Schumacher said Sutherland \"can do almost anything. He's a born character actor.

Locations include the [[Santa Cruz Boardwalk]], the [[Pogonip (park)|Pogonip open space preserve]], and the surrounding [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Other locations included a cliffside on the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] in [[Los Angeles County]], used for the entrance to the vampire cave, and a valley in [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] near [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] where introductory shots were filmed for the scene where Michael and the Lost Boys hang from a railway bridge.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_lostboys.htm| title=The Lost Boys Movie Filming Locations| publisher=fast-rewind.com| access-date=2018-02-17}}</ref> Stage sets included the vampire cave, built on Stage 12 of the [[Warner Bros.]] lot, and a recreation of the interior and exterior of the Pogonip clubhouse on Stage 15, which stood in for Grandpa's house.<ref name=\"retrospective\"/>\n\nSutherland broke his right wrist while doing a [[wheelie]] on his motorcycle and had to wear gloves on set to conceal the cast.
