It is produced by the [[Shanghai Film Studio]] and ERA International, starring [[Ge You]] and [[Gong Li]], in her 7th collaboration with director Zhang Yimou.\n\nThis film is about a couple, portrayed by Ge You and Gong Li, living through tumultuous periods of modern Chinese history, from the [[Chinese Civil War]] in the late 1940s to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. After going through enormous personal difficulties and tragedies, the couple tenaciously survives and endures, witnessing the vast changes of modern China.\n\nBy applying chronological narration to address the social practices of China's ideology, the film demonstrates the difficulties of the common Chinese, reflecting on how the government controls the nation as a collective community without considering their citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Rey|date=1996|title=We Endure, Therefore We Are: Survival, Governance, and Zhang Yimou's To Live}}</ref>\n\nThe portrayal of the Chinese people living under social pressures create the meaning of the film, as their grinding experience shows their resistance and struggles under political changes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''To Live'' was screened at the 1994 [[New York Film Festival]] before eventually receiving a limited release in the United States on November 18, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|author=James, Caryn|date=1994-11-18|title=Film Review; Zhang Yimou's 'To Live'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E6DC1031F93BA25752C1A962958260|access-date=2008-05-20}}</ref> The film has been used in the United States as a support to teach Chinese history in high schools and colleges.<ref name=\":5\">Amy Mungur, \u201cChinese Movies and History Education: The Case of Zhang Yimou's 'To Live',\u201d ''History Compass'' 9,7 (2011): 518\u2013524.</ref>\n\nHaving achieved international success with his previous films (''[[Ju Dou]]'' and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]''), director Zhang Yimou's ''To Live'' came with high expectations, and lived up to it, receiving critical acclaim.

His behavior also causes his long-suffering wife Jiazhen (Gong Li) to leave him, along with their daughter, Fengxia, and their unborn son, Youqing.\n\nFugui eventually reunites with his wife and children but is forced to start a [[shadow play|shadow puppet]] troupe with a partner named Chunsheng. The [[Chinese Civil War]] is occurring at the time, and both Fugui and Chunsheng are conscripted into the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Republic of China armed forces]] during a performance. Midway through the war, the two are captured by the [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[People's Liberation Army]] and serve by performing their shadow puppet routine for the communist revolutionaries. After the Communist victory, Fugui is able to return home, only to find out that due to a week-long fever, Fengxia has become mute and partially deaf.\n\nSoon after his return, Fugui learns that Long'er did not want to donate any of his wealth to the communist people's government, preferring instead to burn all of his property. No one helps put out the fire because Long'er was a gentry. He is eventually put on trial and is sentenced to execution. As Long'er is pulled away, he recognizes Fugui in the crowd and tries to talk to him as he is dragged towards the execution grounds. Fugui is filled with fear and runs into an alleyway before hearing five gunshots. He runs home to tell Jiazhen what has happened, and they quickly pull out the certificate stating that Fugui served in the communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. Jiazhen assures him that they are no longer gentries and will not be killed.\n\nThe story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the [[Great Leap Forward]]. The local town chief enlists everyone to donate all scrap iron to the national drive to [[Backyard furnace|produce steel]] and make weaponry for retaking [[Taiwan]]. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town nightly, and is very smug about his singing abilities.\n\nSoon after, some boys begin picking on Fengxia. Youqing decides to get back at one of the boys by dumping spicy noodles on his head during a communal lunch. Fugui is furious, but Jiazhen stops him and tells him why Youqing acted the way he did. Fugui realizes the love his children have for each other.\n\nThe children are exhausted from the hard labor they are doing in the town and try to sleep whenever they can. They eventually get a break during the festivities for meeting the scrap metal quota. The entire village eats dumplings in celebration. In the midst of the family eating, schoolmates of Youqing call for him to come prepare for the District Chief. Jiazhen tries to make Fugui let him sleep but eventually relents and packs her son twenty dumplings for lunch. Fugui carries his son to the school, and tells him to heat the dumplings before eating them, as he will get sick if he eats cold dumplings. He must listen to his father to have a good life.\n\nLater on in the day, the older men and students rush to tell Fugui that his son has been killed by the District Chief. He was sleeping on the other side of a wall that the Chief's Jeep was on, and the car ran into the wall, injuring the Chief and crushing Youqing. Jiazhen, in hysterics, is forbidden to see her son's dead body, and Fugui screams at his son to wake up. Fengxia is silent in the background.\n\nThe District Chief visits the family at the grave, only to be revealed as Chunsheng. His attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rejected, particularly by Jiazhen, who tells him he owes her family a life. He returns to his Jeep in a haze, only to see his guard beating Fengxia for breaking the Jeep's windows. He tells the guard to stop, and walks home.\n\nThe story moves forward again another decade, to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The village chief advises Fugui's family to burn their puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary. Fengxia carries out the act, and is oblivious to the Chief's real reason for coming: to discuss a suitor for her. Fengxia is now grown up and her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. Erxi, a man crippled by a workplace accident, fixes her parents' roof and paints depictions of [[Mao Zedong]] on their walls with his workmates. He proves to be a kind, gentle man; he and Fengxia fall in love and marry, and she soon becomes pregnant.\n\nChunsheng, still in the government, visits immediately after the wedding to ask for Jiazhen's forgiveness, but she refuses to acknowledge him. Later, he is branded a reactionary and a capitalist. He comes to tell them his wife has committed suicide and he intends to as well. He has come to give them all his money. Fugui refuses to take it. However, as Chunsheng leaves, Jiazhen commands him to live, reminding him that he still owes them a life.\n\nMonths later, during Fengxia's childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital. All doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being over educated, and the students are left as the only ones in charge. Wan Erxi manages to find a doctor to oversee the birth, removing him from confinement, but he is very weak from starvation. Fugui purchases seven steamed buns (mantou) for him and the family decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia dies from [[Postpartum bleeding|postpartum hemorrhage]] (severe blood loss). The point is made that the doctor ate 7 buns, but that by drinking too much water at the same time, each bun expanded to the size of 7 buns: therefore Fengxia's death is a result of the doctor's having the equivalent of 49 buns in his belly.\n\nThe movie ends six years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui's response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film. He expresses optimism for his grandson's future, and the film ends with his statement, \"and life will get better and better\" as the whole family sits down to eat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110081/synopsis |title=To Live (1994) |publisher=IMDb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Larson |first=Wendy |title=Zhang Yimou: Globalization and the Subjection of Culture |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2017 |isbn=9781604979756 |location=Amherst, New York |pages=167\u2013196}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ge You]] as '''Xu Fugui''' (<small>t</small>{{lang|zh|\u5f90\u798f\u8cb4}}, <small>s</small>{{lang|zh|\u5f90\u798f\u8d35}}, ''X\u00fa F\u00fagu\u00ec'', <small>lit.</small>\"Lucky & Rich\"):\n**Fugui came from a rich family, but he is addicted to gambling, so his pregnant wife walked away from him with their daughter.

Yu gave Zhang a set of all of the works that had been published at that point so Zhang could understand his works. Zhang said when he began reading ''To Live'', one of the works, he was unable to stop reading it. Zhang met with Yu to discuss the script for ''Mistake at River's Edge'', but they kept bringing up ''To Live''. Thus, the two decided to adapt ''To Live'' instead.<ref name=\"Berry242\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nGe You, known for his comedic roles, was chosen by Zhang Yimou to play the title character, Fugui. Known for poker-faced comedy, he was not accustomed to expressing emotional states this character requires. Thus, he was not very confident in himself, even protesting going to the Cannes Film Festival where he would eventually garner a best actor award.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Berry|first=Michael|title=Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780231133302|location=New York|pages=109\u2013135}}</ref>\n\n=== Director ===\nGrowing up, Zhang spent his youth years through the Cultural revolution. Having personally experienced what it was like in such a time and setting, he had a very strong understanding and emotional connection with Chinese culture and society.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nAs a student who studied screen studies in university in the country\u2019s capital city, he and his peers were heavily exposed to various movies from across the world and across time. His classmate, who is now the President of the Beijing Film Academy stated that during their four years in university, they went through over 500 films spanning from Hollywood films from the 1930s to Italian Neo-Realism films. Zhang Yimou stated in a previous interview that even after many years, he still remembered the culture shock he experienced when first exposed to the wide variety of films.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Zhou|first=Xuelin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990802735|title=Globalization and contemporary Chinese cinema : Zhang Yimou's genre films|date=2017|isbn=978-981-10-4328-4|location=Singapore|oclc=990802735}}</ref>\n\nThe combination of the two very crucial parts of his life provided him with a very strong vision for his films. He was able to have a very strong understanding of both the Chinese national outlook as well as the international outlook of films and applied them extensively throughout his career.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nZhang described that To Live is the film he felt the strongest connection to because of the Cultural Revolution background in the film. The political background of Zhang\u2019s family was the label \u201cdouble-counterrevolutionary\u201d, which was the worst kind of counterrevolutionary. Different from other fifth-generation filmmakers such as Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang, Zhang was in a desperate state and cannot trace back things that were lost during the Cultural Revolution.\u00a0 Zhang said \u201cFor me, that was an era without hope \u2013 I lived in a world of desperation\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nZhang, in an interview, described how he used different elements that diverged from the original novel. The use of the shadow play and puppet theatre was to emphasize a different visual look. The ending of the film To Live is different from the novel\u2019s because Zhang wanted to pass the censorship in China and gain approval from the audience in mainland China, even though the film has not been publicly screened in China yet. On the other hand, Zhang\u2019s family had suffered enormously during the Cultural Revolution, but, as Zhang stated, they still survived. Thus, he felt that the book\u2019s ending where everyone in Fu Gui\u2019s family had died was not as reasonable. Furthermore, Zhang Yimou chose Ge You, who is famous for his comedic roles to play the protagonist, Fu Gui. Ge You actually inspired Zhang to add more humorous elements in the film, therefore it is more reasonable not to kill every character at the end.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Differences from the novel ===\n\n* Moved the setting from rural southern China to a small city in northern China.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Added elements of shadow puppetry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n**A symbol of wealth.

In the film, these deliberately set dramatic turns highlight the theme that those infinitely small people, as living \u201cothers\u201d, can only rely on living instinct to bear suffering in history, times and social torrents. The theme of the novel- the ability to bear suffering and the optimistic attitude to the world- is hidden in these little people who are helpless to their own fate but still alive strongly.<ref name=\":6\">Zhang Lijun & Li Jiahui. (2020). The exploration of the aesthetic concept of film adaptation in contemporary Chinese realistic literature. Journal of Film Studies (03), pp 36-46.</ref>\n\nAs a film art that can restore extreme reality and stimulate the audience\u2019s audio-visual sense to the greatest extent, if it still follows the original \u201cdeath fable\u201d style of telling, it will undoubtedly be depressing and dark, which will have a certain negative impact on the audience. Therefore, it is a feasible strategy for Zhang Yimou\u2019s film adaptation to implement moderate deviation and elimination of suffering in order to weaken the excessive impact of film art communication. According to his personal experiences, Zhang Yimou blended the story into historical background and used a more gentle technique to highlight the helplessness of the character\u2019s fate under the influence of the time. It indirectly expresses the main idea of the novel and weakens the feeling of suffocating, which makes it an excellent adaptation film with \u201cZhang\u2019s brand\u201d. This work not only tries to restore the original, but also joins another creative subject: the director\u2019s thinking and independent consciousness. The added shadow puppets and innovative changes to the ending, to certain extent, achieved the film because the main thrust of the novel is shown in these innovations. The translation of text into a new film language, although with a strong Zhang\u2019s brand, ensures the original spiritual connotation. The film \u201cTo Live\u201d has also become a successful attempt of comprehensive transformation from literature art to film art.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Limited release in North America ===\nThe film opened on September 16, 1994 in Canada.

Both of these films had alerted the Chinese government due to their similar critical portrayals of Chinese policies, and made them very cautious and aware of the need to ban any future films that tried to touch on the same topics.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nTo Live received critical acclaim and various critics selected the film in their year end lists.<ref name=\"LATimesYE\">{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=December 25, 1994|title=1994: YEAR IN REVIEW : No Weddings, No Lions, No Gumps|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-25-ca-12998-story.html|access-date=July 20, 2020|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nThere is, among film critics, almost a consensus that To Live is not merely a lament of difficult times, nor a critique of the evils of the totalitarian system, but more \u201can homage to the characters\u2019 resilience and heroism in their odyssey of survival.\u201d Some scholars further argue that the era\u2019s hostile and chaotic environment is not the story itself, but simply serves as a stage for the story.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n==== Year-end lists ====\n\n* 4th - [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]], [[Los Angeles Times]].<ref name=\"LATimesYE\" />\n* 5th - [[Janet Maslin]], [[The New York Times]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=1994-12-27|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Good, Bad and In-Between In a Year of Surprises on Film|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/27/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-good-bad-and-in-between-in-a-year-of-surprises-on-film.html|access-date=2021-06-13|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n* 5th - [[James Berardinelli]], ReelViews <ref>{{Cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Rewinding 1994 - The Year in Film|url=https://preview.reelviews.net/comment/010295.html|url-status=live|access-date=June 13, 2021|website=ReelViews}}</ref>\n* 9th - [[Michael MacCambridge]], [[Austin American-Statesman]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=MacCambridge|first=Michael|date=December 22, 1994|title=It's a LOVE-HATE thing|page=38|work=Austin American-Statesman}}</ref>\n* Honourable mention - Mike Clark, [[USA Today]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Clark|first=Mike|date=December 28, 1994|title=Scoring with True Life, 'True Lies' and 'Fiction'|page=5D|work=USA Today}}</ref>\n* Honourable mention - Betsy Pickle, [[Knoxville News Sentinel|Knoxville News-Sentinel]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pickle|first=Betsy|date=December 30, 1994|title=Searching for the Top 10...

These dumplings reappeared as an offering on Youqing\u2019s tomb repeatedly. Rather than being eaten and absorbed, the dumplings are now lumps of dough and meat standing as reminders of a life that has been irreparably wasted.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Mantou (steamed wheat bun): When Fengxia is giving birth, Doctor Wang, the only qualified doctor, passed out due to eating too many buns after a long time of hunger. Thus, he was unable to save Fengxia\u2019s life. The mantou, meant to ease his hunger, rehydrated and expanded within his stomach, shrunken with starvation. \u201cFilling stomach\u201d ironically leads to the death of Fengxia. The buns did not save a life - it is an indirect killer of Fengxia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Noodles: Youqing used his meal as revenge for his sister. Although wasted in a literal sense, they are not wasted in Youqing\u2019s mind. Food is not merely for \u201cfilling stomach\u201d or \u201cto live,\u201d similarly, \u201cto live\u201d does not depend solely on foods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Shadow puppetry ===\nThe usage of shadow puppetry, which carries a historical and cultural heritage, throughout the movie acts as a parallel to what characters experience in the events that they have to live through.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Lu|first=Sheldon H.|title=[[Transnational Chinese Cinemas]]|publisher=[[University of Hawai'i Press]]|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n=== Recurring lines ===\nIn two places of the film, there is a similar line. The version that appears earlier in the film is: \u201cThe little chickens will grow to be ducks, the ducks will become geese, and the geese will become oxen, and tomorrow will be better because of communism.\u201d The version that appears later in the film is: \u201cThe little chickens will grow to be ducks, the ducks will become geese, and the geese will become oxen, and tomorrow will be better.\u201d This line acts as a picture of the Chinese people\u2019s perseverance in the face of historical hardships, giving the feeling of hope for the audience.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Other facts ==\n\n* Referential meaning of the film: The scene in which the father publicly punishes the son in To Live can be read as a miniaturized re-rendering of the dramatic punishing scene watched by the entire world in June 1989, the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Massacre]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n*There is a scene that the local town chief\u00a0calls on everyone to donate the iron products of the family to make steel. This implies the historical time jumps to the Great Leap Forward. At that period of time, the Communist Party tried to copy the huge success of the industrial revolution in Britain. However, the method is wrong and wasn't helpful. It shows that when the flood of time come upon a single family, they have no choice but to be carried forward.\n*In the film To Live, during its second half, another tragedy occurred to Fugui's family - Fengxia died of childbirth. None of the nurses knew how to treat postpartum hemorrhage. It's worth noting that the nurses are saying: \"We don't know how to deal with this! We are just students!\"As the most qualified doctor is almost beaten to death. This section of the film suggests the suffering that the Cultural Revolution brought to people. Most doctors were replaced by Red Guards and were accused as reactionaries.<ref name=\":5\" /> As the sign on the doctor's body shows, he was in many struggle sessions with the Red Guard.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Banned films#People's Republic of China|Banned films in China]]\n* [[Censorship in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[List of Chinese films]]\n* [[List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Giskin, Howard and Bettye S.
