The film's [[cinematography]], [[film editing|editing]], score and [[sound design]] were also by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. Lynch's longtime collaborator and wife [[Mary Sweeney]] co-produced the film. The cast includes such [[List of frequent David Lynch collaborators|Lynch regulars]] as [[Laura Dern]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Grace Zabriskie]], as well as [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Karolina Gruszka]], [[Peter J. Lucas]], [[Krzysztof Majchrzak]], and [[Julia Ormond]]. There are also brief appearances by a host of additional actors, including [[Nastassja Kinski]], [[Laura Harring]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], and [[William H. Macy]]. The voices of Harring, [[Naomi Watts]], and [[Scott Coffey]] are included in excerpts from Lynch's 2002 ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' online project. The title borrows its name from a [[Inland Empire|metropolitan area in Southern California]].\n\nReleased with the [[tagline]] \"A Woman in Trouble\", the film follows the fragmented and nightmarish events surrounding a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actress (Laura Dern) who begins to take on the personality of a character she plays in a supposedly cursed film production. An international co-production between the United States, France, and Poland, the film was completed over a three-year period and shot primarily in [[Los Angeles]] and Poland. The process marked several firsts for Lynch: the film was shot without a finished [[screenplay]], instead being largely developed on a scene-by-scene basis; and it was shot entirely in low-resolution [[digital video]] by Lynch himself using a handheld [[Sony DCR-VX1000|Sony camcorder]] rather than traditional [[film stock]].<ref name=\"grf4\"/>\n\n''Inland Empire'' premiered in Italy at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 6 September 2006.<ref name=\"grf4\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5321270.stm |title={{hlist|BBC NEWS | Entertainment | David Lynch given lifetime award}} |date=6 September 2006 |work=[[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> It received generally positive but polarized reviews from critics, with attention centering on its challenging and [[surrealist]] elements.<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inland_empire |title=Inland Empire |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=12 February 2021}}</ref> It was named the second-best film of 2007 (tied with two others) by ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y2007 |title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951\u20132009 |work=alumnus.caltech.edu |access-date=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y2007 |archive-date=27 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and listed among ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s \"thirty best films of the 2000s\",<ref>{{Cite web |title=BFI {{!}} Sight & Sound {{!}} Sight & Sound's films of the decade |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49593 |access-date=2022-09-10 |website=old.bfi.org.uk}}</ref> as well as ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s \"10 most underrated movies of the decade\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/dec/22/10-most-underrated-movies |title=The view: The 10 most underrated movies of the decade {{!}} Film {{!}} guardian.co.uk |last=Leigh |first=Danny |date=22 December 2009 |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film was remastered by Lynch and [[Janus Films]] in 2022.<ref name=Perez/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn a hotel room, the Lost Girl, a young prostitute, cries following an unpleasant encounter with a client while watching a television show about a family of [[Rabbits (film)|surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits]] who speak in cryptic statements and questions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles actress Nikki Grace auditions for the lead role in the film, ''On High in Blue Tomorrows''. In her mansion, she is visited by a neighbor, who asks about the film and then tells \"an old tale\": a boy passed through the doorway into the world, causing a reflection that gave birth to evil that followed him. Then she tells a variation: a girl was lost in the marketplace \"as if half-born\" while the alley behind the marketplace was the way to the palace. The woman is certain that Nikki will get the role, and insists, despite Nikki's claims to the contrary, that the plot involves murder. The next day, Nikki celebrates having won the role as her Polish husband Piotrek watches on.\n\nDuring the first rehearsal involving Nikki and the film's lead actor Devon, the actors are interrupted by a disturbance on the set. Devon investigates, but finds nothing. Shaken by the event, director Kingsley Stewart confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German film entitled ''47'', based on a Polish folk-tale. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.\n\nAfter filming the first few romantic scenes between their respective characters Sue and Billy, Nikki and Devon begin an affair, despite earlier protestations that their relationship would be strictly professional and despite Piotrek warning Devon of \"dark consequences\" for \"wrong actions\". Nikki starts to have difficulties distinguishing between real life and scenes from the film. Entering a door marked \"Axxon N.\" in an alley, she finds herself walking onto the set and causing the disturbance during the first rehearsal weeks earlier. Nikki runs away and enters a prop, which turns into an actual house. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband going to bed. She hides from him in a closet, where she encounters a troupe of prostitutes.\n\nAt this point, various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other, with the chronological order and the distinction between characters unclear. Some scenes show her joining the (modern-day) prostitutes, while other scenes depicts prostitutes and pimps in a wintery [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] in the 1930s. She is also shown to live a troubled marriage with her poor husband \"Smithy\". In another set of scenes, Nikki/Sue is talking to a policeman in a room above a nightclub. She tells him how she was [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused in her childhood]] and how her husband joined a traveling circus from Poland as a gamekeeper. She also speaks of the Phantom, a hypnotist who worked at the circus and then disappeared.\n\nIn one scene, Sue confronts Billy in front of his family, professing her love. She is sent away and slapped by Billy's wife Doris. It is now revealed that Doris was the woman who earlier told a policeman that she had been hypnotized to kill someone and found a screwdriver sticking in her own stomach. Doris remembers that the Phantom hypnotized her to kill Sue.\n\nFeeling stalked by the Phantom, Nikki/Sue arms herself with a screwdriver. Walking down [[Hollywood Boulevard]] she notices her doppelg\u00e4nger and Doris and meets with the policeman above the nightclub. Outside, she is eventually stabbed by Doris with her own screwdriver. Nikki/Sue collapses at a bus stop next to two homeless women. One tells all kinds of strange stories about her friend Niko, while the other holds a lighter in front of Sue's face until she dies. Kingsley yells \"Cut!\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.\n\nKingsley informs Nikki that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only ''On High in Blue Tomorrows'' but events that are occurring in real-time. She follows a man upstairs and enters an apartment marked \"Axxon N\". Confronted by the Phantom, Nikki shoots him. The Phantom transforms into a grotesque figure before dying. Nikki flees into Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television - though she fails to see them - and then meets the Lost Girl. The Lost Girl escapes from the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces her husband and son. Nikki is back at her mansion.\n\nThe film ends with a celebration involving the troupe of prostitutes, a one-legged woman mentioned earlier, Niko and her pet monkey and others. The women dance to [[Nina Simone]]'s \"[[Sinner Man]]\", while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.<!-- Please don't add your interpretation of what you think the ending means -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Nikki Grace / Sue Blue\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Kingsley Stewart\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Devon Berk / Billy Side\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Freddie Howard\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Doris Side\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Marilyn Levens\n* [[Peter J.
