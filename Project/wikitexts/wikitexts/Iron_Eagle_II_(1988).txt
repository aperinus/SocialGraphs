Furie]] and written by Furie and [[Kevin Alyn Elders]]. It is the first sequel to the 1986 film ''[[Iron Eagle]]'', with [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] reprising his role as Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair, alongside newcomers [[Mark Humphrey (actor)|Mark Humphrey]], [[Stuart Margolin]], [[Maury Chaykin]], [[Alan Scarfe]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[Clark Johnson]].<ref>Orriss 2018, p. 180.</ref> An uncredited [[Jason Gedrick]] also returns as ace pilot Doug Masters in the film's opening scene.\n\nThe film's story is loosely based on [[Operation Opera]], a surprise [[airstrike]] carried out by the [[Israeli Air Force]] on a [[nuclear reactor]] near [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] on June 7, 1981.\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Iron Eagle II'' received negative reviews. It also did not fare well at the box-office, with earnings of $10,497,324. Despite this, it was nominated for three [[Genie Awards]] ([[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Overall Sound|Best Overall Sound]]).\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on a routine patrol in [[United States]] airspace west of [[Alaska]], pilots Doug \"Thumper\" Masters and Matt \"Cobra\" Cooper test the [[g-force]]s of their [[F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D|F-16C]] fighter aircraft. Their antics get them carried away, and they stray over [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] airspace. As they are being escorted back into U.S. airspace, one of the Soviet fighters (actually [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]] because [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]] were unavailable) locks onto Doug, resulting in a dogfight where Matt loses control of his plane and is too late to save Doug, who is shot down by the Soviets. The next day, the [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] publicly denies the incident, claiming a training accident caused by a fuel system malfunction killed Doug.\n\nAt the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|United States Air Force Museum]] in Arizona, Col. Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair is taken out of reserve duty and promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] to lead \"Operation Dark Star\", a top-secret military operation. He meets up with Matt and the rest of the operation's selected pilots and soldiers at an undisclosed military base in [[Israel]]. The group is shortly joined by a group of Soviet pilots that comprise the other half of the operation, much to their dismay. During their briefing, it is revealed that an unnamed Middle Eastern country has completed construction of a nuclear weapons compound capable of launching warheads towards both the United States and the Soviet Union. Their mission is to destroy the compound, as its nuclear arms will be ready within two weeks. Both the Americans and Soviets have difficulty cooperating with each other. The situation is further complicated when Matt realizes that ace pilot Yuri Lebanov is the one who shot down Doug. At the same time, he slowly develops a relationship with female pilot Valeri Zuyeniko.\n\nAfter a mock dogfight followed by a fist fight that gets them grounded, Matt and Lebanov settle their differences. However, Major Bush, the lead American pilot, is killed during a training exercise due to his [[claustrophobia]]. Chappy is later informed that the joint operation is canceled. He realizes that as both the American and Soviet teams consist of delinquent soldiers, the operation was doomed to fail from the beginning. Nevertheless, he is grateful that both factions have the courage to cooperate with each other. His pep talk encourages the entire operation to continue with the mission against General Stillmore's orders.\n\nFor the mission, the F-16 units are to fire their missiles at the compound through the ventilation shafts while the MiGs provide high-altitude cover against enemy aircraft. Ground units are also necessary to take out the anti-aircraft defenses. Upon entering enemy airspace, the transport plane carrying the [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] is shot down. Chappy orders the pilots to abort the mission, but Matt and his wingman Graves disobey and provide air cover to the ground units. Both pilots are outnumbered by the opposing fighters, but Valeri and Lebanov arrive to even the playing field. Meanwhile, the enemy prepares to launch a warhead while the U.S. and Soviet forces order bombers on standby in case the operation fails. Chappy and the ground forces manage to destroy the guidance tower controlling the [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] launchers, but Hickman is killed in the process. They reach the target point, but Graves is shot down by an anti-aircraft gun. Valeri takes over while Matt provides cover. She fires her two remaining missiles, one of which penetrates through the ventilation shaft, obliterating the compound completely.\n\nAfter the joint operation is congratulated, Chappy is offered continued service under General Stillmore, but he adamantly declines the offer. Matt and Valeri bid each other farewell, but Chappy reveals to him that they are flying to [[Moscow]] on Tuesday as part of a pilot exchange program.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Colonel / Brigadier General Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair\n* [[Mark Humphrey (actor)|Mark Humphrey]] as Captain Matt \"Cobra\" Cooper\n* [[Stuart Margolin]] as General Stillmore\n* [[Alan Scarfe]] as Colonel Vardovsky\n* Sharon Brandon as Valeri Zuyeniko\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Sergeant Neville Downs\n* [[Colm Feore]] as Lieutenant Yuri Lebanov\n* [[Clark Johnson]] as Captain Richie Graves\n* [[Jason Blicker]] as [[Technical Sergeant#United States Air Force|Technical Sergeant]] Hickman\n* [[Jesse Collins]] as Major Lionel Bush\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Mikhail Balyonev\n* [[Uri Gavriel]] as Georgi Koshkin\n* [[Neil Munro (actor)|Neil Munro]] as Edward Strappman\n* [[Doug Sheldon|Douglas Sheldon]] as Sergei Demitriev\n* Azaria Rapaport as Stepanov\n* Nicolas Coucos as M.P.
