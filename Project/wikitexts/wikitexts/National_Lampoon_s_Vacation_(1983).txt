It tells the story of a family that goes on a cross-country trip to an amusement park as hilarious hi-jinks occur along the way. The screenplay was written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] on the basis of his [[short story]] \"Vacation '58,\" which appeared in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, earning more than $60 million in the U.S. with an estimated budget of $15 million, and received positive reviews from critics.\n\nAs a result of its success, five sequels have been produced: ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation|European Vacation]]'' (1985), ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation|Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989), ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' (1997), ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2|Christmas Vacation 2]]'' (2003) and ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015).

Ellen wants to fly, but Clark insists on driving, so he can bond with his family. He has ordered a new car in preparation for the trip, but the dealer claims that it will not be ready for six weeks. Clark is forced to buy the 'Wagon Queen Family Truckster', an ugly, oversized [[station wagon]], after the car he brought to trade in has been hauled away and crushed.\n\nDuring the family's travels, they experience numerous mishaps, such as being tagged by vandals in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. Clark aggravates a bartender in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Kansas]] and is tantalized on numerous occasions by a beautiful young woman driving a flashy red [[Ferrari 308 GTS]].\n\nThey stop in [[Coolidge, Kansas]] to visit Ellen's cousin Catherine and her husband Eddie, who foist cranky Aunt Edna and her mean dog Dinky on the Griswolds, asking them to drop her off at her son Norman's home in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].\n\nAfter stopping at a decrepit and dirty campground in [[South Fork, Colorado|South Fork]], [[Colorado]] for the night, Clark forgets to untie Dinky's leash from the bumper before driving off the next morning, killing the dog. A motorcycle cop pulls the Griswolds over and angrily lectures Clark over [[animal cruelty]], but accepts Clark's apology. Edna learns of her dog's death and becomes more irate with Clark. Exiting Colorado, Ellen loses her bag which had her credit cards, forcing Clark to cash a check for future spending.\n\nWhile Ellen and Clark argue during a drive between [[Utah]] and [[Arizona]], they crash and become stranded in the desert near [[Monument Valley]]. Clark and Rusty have a bonding experience explaining why Clark wants to take this vacation. After setting off alone in the desert to look for help, Clark eventually reunites with his family, who have been rescued and taken to a local mechanic. The mechanic extorts Clark's remaining cash only to render the car barely operational. Frustrated, they stop at the [[Grand Canyon]]. When Clark is unable to convince a hotel clerk to cash a personal check because his credit card was reported stolen, he raids the cash register behind the clerk's back and leaves the check.\n\nLeaving, they find that Aunt Edna has died in her sleep. They tie her corpse to the roof of the car, wrapped in a tarpaulin. When they reach Norman's home, they discover he is out of town so they leave Edna's body by the back door with a note. The family has a small memorial for her although Ellen is annoyed by Clark\u2019s indifferent eulogy.\n\nOverwhelmed by the mishaps they have encountered during the road trip, Ellen and the children want to go back home, but Clark has become obsessed with reaching Walley World and they continue on. After an argument with Ellen, Clark eventually meets the Ferrari-driving blonde beauty at a hotel bar and goes [[skinny-dipping]] with her in its pool, but they are discovered by the family before anything intimate happens. Ellen forgives Clark and they go skinny-dipping themselves.\n\nDespite the family's misfortunes, they finally arrive at Walley World the next day only to discover the park closed for the next two weeks for repairs. Finally slipping into madness and realizing that all his efforts have been for nothing, Clark buys a realistic-looking [[BB gun]] and demands that park security guard Russ Lasky take them through Walley World. Ellen and the kids follow, attempting to placate Clark. Eventually, an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[SWAT]] team arrives and just as the family is about to be arrested, the park owner Roy Walley appears. Roy understands Clark's impassioned longing to achieve the perfect vacation, bringing back memories of his own family vacation headaches. He decides not to file criminal charges against the Griswolds and lets the family \u2013 along with the SWAT team \u2013 enjoy the park as his guests.\n\nDuring the credits, a photo montage is seen. The final photo shows that the family flew back to Chicago with souvenir hats.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Clark W.
