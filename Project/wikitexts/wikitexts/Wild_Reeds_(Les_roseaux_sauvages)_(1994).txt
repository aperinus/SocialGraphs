The film was selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]], but not nominated.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in southwest France in 1962. Fran\u00e7ois ([[Ga\u00ebl Morel]]), a shy young man from the lower middle class, is working towards his high school diploma. He spends most of his time talking about movies and literature with his best friend, Ma\u00eft\u00e9 ([[\u00c9lodie Bouchez]]), whose mother Mme Alvarez ([[Mich\u00e8le Moretti]]) is Fran\u00e7ois's French teacher. Mme Alvarez and Ma\u00eft\u00e9 are communists. At the boarding school, Fran\u00e7ois becomes acquainted with Serge ([[St\u00e9phane Rideau]]), the sensual son of immigrant farmers. At night, he joins Fran\u00e7ois in the dormitory to chat. Finally, Serge draws Fran\u00e7ois into an erotic relationship.\n\nFran\u00e7ois discovers his homosexuality and develops a deep attraction for Serge, who has only acted out of curiosity. Fran\u00e7ois confides this discovery to Ma\u00eft\u00e9, who swallows her disappointment and encourages him to [[Coming out|come out of the closet]]. When Serge becomes increasingly interested in Ma\u00eft\u00e9, she declares herself to be interested in nobody.\n\nSerge's brother Pierre dies while serving in the army in Algeria, and Ma\u00eft\u00e9's mother suffers a nervous breakdown, having previously refused to help Pierre desert. An Algerian-born French exile, Henri ([[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gorny]]), enrolls in the boys' boarding school and aggravates their conflicts, adding a political conflict. He is obsessed with events in Algeria and supports the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]], which opposes Algerian independence and defends the rights of French settlers there. He treats Fran\u00e7ois without sympathy and bluntly tells him to own up to his homosexuality. His political stance provokes Serge's hatred. Henri finally engages Ma\u00eft\u00e9, his political opposite, and they yield to their mutual attraction.\n\nEach member of the quartet develops in the course of the film, shifting repeatedly from stubborn positions to more flexible appreciations of their circumstances, explained in French class by a reading of \"[[The Oak and the Reed#Later interpretations|The Oak and the Reed]]\", one of [[La Fontaine's Fables]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[\u00c9lodie Bouchez]] as Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Alvarez\n* [[Ga\u00ebl Morel]] as Fran\u00e7ois Forestier\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rideau]] as Serge Bartolo\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gorny]] as Henri Mariani\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Moretti]] as Madame Alvarez\n* [[Jacques Nolot]] as Monsieur Morelli\n* Eric Kreikenmayer as Pierre Bartolo, the Groom\n* Nathalie Vignes as Ir\u00e8ne, the Bride\n* Michel Ruhl as Monsieur Cassagne\n* Fatia Maite as Aicha Morelli\n\n==Production==\nThe project was first conceived as part of a television film series dealing with adolescence, ''Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles de leurs \u00e2ges'', entitled ''Le ch\u00eane et le roseau'' (''The Oak and the Reed''), which made up the first 55 minutes of ''Wild Reeds''. But after completing the script, T\u00e9chin\u00e9 decided to make it a full theatrical release. Based on his own life story, it is his biggest personal success in France and his most intimate film.\n\nIt is one of limited number of films on the politically delicate subject of the Algerian War. They include ''[[The Little Soldier]]'' (1963), ''[[To Be Twenty in the Aures|Avoir vingt ans dans les Aur\u00e8s]]'' (1972), and ''La Question'' (1977).\n\n==Music==\n* \"[[Barbara Ann]]\" \u2013 [[The Beach Boys]]\n* ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'' \u2013 [[Samuel Barber]]\n* ''Wo die Zitronen bl\u00fchen'' & ''Fr\u00fchlingsstimmen'' \u2013 [[Johann Strauss II]]\n* \"[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]\" \u2013 [[Del Shannon]]\n* \"[[Let's Twist Again]]\" \u2013 [[Chubby Checker]]\n* \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" \u2013 [[The Platters]]\n* \"Soave sia il vento\" (from ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'') - [[Mozart]]\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film was met with widespread critical acclaim and holds a rare 100% \"Fresh\" ratings on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wild_reeds/ |title = Wild Reeds - Rotten Tomatoes| website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn France the film received limited release, playing at a total of 40 cinemas and opening in second place at the French box office gaining 37,688 admissions its opening weekend.
