Jackson]], [[Christina Ricci]], and [[Justin Timberlake]]. The film focuses on a Mississippi [[bluesman]] who holds a troubled local woman captive in his house in an attempt to cure her of [[Hypersexuality|nymphomania]] after finding her severely beaten on the side of a road. The title of the film derives from the 1927 [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] song. The film draws numerous references to the [[Delta Blues|Mississippi Blues movement]], particularly in its title and soundtrack. ''Black Snake Moan'' garnered mixed to positive reviews from critics, and was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing only $10.9 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centers on two main characters: Lazarus Redd, a deeply religious farmer and former [[blues]] guitarist, and Rae Doole, a young [[Sex addiction|sex addict]]. Lazarus' wife and his brother were having an affair, which has left him bitter and angry. Rae's boyfriend Ronnie Morgan leaves for deployment with the 196th Field Artillery Brigade, [[United States National Guard|Tennessee National Guard]], and in his absence, she indulges in bouts of [[promiscuity]] and drug use. During one of Rae's binges, Ronnie's friend Gill Morton tries to take advantage of her. She laughs at his advances, comparing him unfavorably with another man, and he severely beats her. Believing she's dead, Gill dumps Rae and leaves her by the side of the road wearing only a shirt and panties and drives away.\n\nLazarus discovers Rae unconscious next to the road the next morning and brings her home to nurse her back to health. Lazarus goes to see Tehronne &ndash; the man who Lazarus thought had beaten her &ndash; and learns of her promiscuity. Over the course of several days, Rae, delirious with fever, occasionally wakes up and tries to flee from Lazarus. He chains her to the radiator to keep her from running away. After Rae regains her wits, Lazarus announces that it is his spiritual duty to heal her of her sinful ways and refuses to release her until he does so. Rae makes several attempts to escape, and even briefly has sex with a teenager who helps out on Lazarus' farm.\n\nShe eventually comes to tolerate her position. Lazarus buys her a conservative dress to wear, plays the guitar for her, and feeds her home-cooked meals. Lazarus' pastor and close friend, R.L., visits Lazarus at his house and discovers that Lazarus is imprisoning Rae. The pastor tries to reason with Lazarus and the group shares a meal.\n\nMeanwhile, Ronnie returns to town after being discharged from the National Guard due to his severe [[anxiety disorder]]. While searching for Rae, who has disappeared, he meets Gill, who informs him that Rae cheats on him whenever he is out of town. Ronnie attacks Gill, steals his truck, and continues searching for Rae.\n\nIn the morning, Lazarus frees Rae, having decided that he has no authority to pass judgment on her. Rae chooses to stay with Lazarus of her own will. That night during a thunderstorm, at Rae's request, Lazarus sings a song for her, \"Black Snake Moan\" by [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]]. Later, Rae and Lazarus take a trip into town, where Rae confronts her mother about the [[sexual abuse]] she suffered at the hands of her mother's partner. Meanwhile, Lazarus has formed a budding romance with the local pharmacist, Angela. He plays a blues concert at a local bar, which Rae attends. Ronnie spots Rae and follows her to Lazarus' house. He confronts the pair with a pistol, but Lazarus talks him down and summons the pastor. Ronnie and Rae decide they are stronger together than apart and get married. While driving away, Ronnie suffers from a panic attack again and Rae begins to have one of her spells, but then they pull themselves together, and resolve to take care of each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Samuel L.
