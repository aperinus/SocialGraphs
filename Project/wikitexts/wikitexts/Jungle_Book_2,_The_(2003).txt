The theatrical version of the film was released in France on February 5, 2003, and released in the United States on February 14, 2003. The film is a [[sequel]] to [[Walt Disney]]'s 1967 film ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]] as the voice of [[Mowgli]] and [[John Goodman]] as the voice of [[Baloo]].\n\nThe film was originally produced as a [[direct-to-video]] film, but was released theatrically first, similar to the ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' sequel ''[[Return to Never Land]]''. It is the fourth animated Disney sequel to have a theatrical release rather than going direct-to-video after ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' (1990), ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' (1999), and ''[[Return to Never Land]]'' (2002) and the final one until ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]'' (2018) and ''[[Frozen II]]'' (2019). The film is not based on ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]''. However, they do have several characters in common.\n\nThe film received negative reviews directed towards the animation and similarity in plotline to the first film. However, it was a box office success, grossing $135.7 million against a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMowgli resides in the \"Man-Village\" with the girl Shanti who lured him in, and he ends up being adopted by the village leader, who has a wife named Messua and a son named Ranjan. However, wanting to return to the exciting life of the jungle, he nearly leads the other children in the village into the jungle, and the village leader punishes him for disobeying what he told Mowgli about not leaving the village and putting them in danger.\n\nMeanwhile, in the jungle, Shere Khan has returned to Baloo and Bagheera's part of the jungle, seeking revenge on Mowgli for defeating him. Baloo enters the Man-Village and takes Mowgli back into the jungle; however, unbeknownst to them, Shere Khan had also enter the village, only to be attacked by the villagers. In the ensuing chase, Shanti and Ranjan sneak into the jungle to rescue Mowgli, believing that Baloo is a [[Rabies|rabid animal]] who has kidnapped him.\n\nBagheera learns of Mowgli's escape from the village when the humans search the jungle for him, and immediately suspects Baloo. Mowgli instructs Baloo to scare off Shanti should she appear, and bemoans about his boring life in the Man-Village. Baloo and Mowgli journey to King Louie's old temple (King Louie is mentioned to have moved out), for a party. However, when the jungle animals mock Shanti and other aspects of Mowgli's life in the Man-Village, Mowgli angrily leaves. He finds Shanti and Ranjan, but Baloo scares Shanti. When the truth comes out that Mowgli ordered Baloo to scare her, Shanti and Ranjan run away, abandoning Mowgli.\n\nBaloo realizes that Mowgli misses his village life, but when Mowgli tries to make amends with his human friends, they are cornered by Shere Khan. The tiger chases Mowgli and Shanti to an abandoned temple built above a lake of [[lava]]. Baloo instructs Bagheera to protect Ranjan while he goes to save Mowgli and Shanti. After confusing Shere Khan by banging several different gongs, Shanti's presence is revealed to Shere Khan. Baloo tackles Shere Khan to the ground, allowing Mowgli and Shanti enough time to escape, but the tiger chases them to a statue across a pit of lava. Shere Khan is trapped within the statue's mouth, and it plummets onto a large stone in the lava below.\n\nWith Shere Khan finally thwarted, Baloo decides to let Mowgli return to the Man-Village with Shanti and Ranjan, and Bagheera proudly compliments Baloo for making a wise decision. Upon returning to the Man-Village with Shanti and Ranjan, Mowgli reconciles with the village leader, who apologizes to Mowgli for failing to understand that the jungle was part of his identity. The children return daily to visit Baloo and Bagheera in the jungle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Haley Joel Osment]] as [[Mowgli]], a young boy raised in the jungle, who wants to return there.
