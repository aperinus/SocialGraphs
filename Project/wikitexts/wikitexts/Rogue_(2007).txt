''[[boxofficemojo.com]]''</ref>\n}}\n'''''Rogue''''' is a 2007 Australian [[independent film|independent]] [[horror film]] written, produced and directed by [[Greg McLean (film director)|Greg McLean]], about a group of tourists in Australia who fall prey to a giant, {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} man-eating crocodile. It stars [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Michael Vartan]], and [[Sam Worthington]].\n\nThe film was inspired by the true story of [[Sweetheart (crocodile)|Sweetheart]], a giant male [[saltwater crocodile]] that attacked boats in the late 1970s, although Sweetheart was never responsible for an attack on a human. ''Rogue'' received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure.\n\nIt is the second and last film from Dimension Films to have the involvement of Village Roadshow Pictures, the other being 1992's ''[[Fortress (1992 film)|Fortress]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nAmerican travel journalist Pete McKell ([[Michael Vartan]]) joins a small group of tourists on a crocodile-watching [[river cruise]] in [[Kakadu National Park]] of Australia's [[Northern Territory]], led by wildlife researcher Kate Ryan ([[Radha Mitchell]]). Toward the end of the cruise, Everett ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) spots a flare in the distance and the group head up river to investigate. They eventually come across a half-sunken wreck when something crashes into their boat, splitting the side.\n\nKate manages to steer the boat ashore a small island in the middle of the river. Kate realises they are in the crocodile's territory and explains they must leave the island by nightfall, as the tide will start to rise and the island will be submerged. Moments after, Everett is pulled into the water by an unseen predator and is killed. Two locals, Neil ([[Sam Worthington]]) and Collin ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]), arrive at the island but the beast upturns their boat; Neil swims to the island while Collin is killed.\n\nAs night falls, Neil carefully swims to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a [[zip-line]] to allow the group to cross the river. Everett's wife Mary Ellen ([[Caroline Brazier]]) crosses first, only to freeze in fear halfway across. Allen ([[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]]), becoming impatient and aggressive, attempts to get himself and his daughter Sherry ([[Mia Wasikowska]]) across with Mary Ellen still on the line. While trying to secure the rope, Neil is attacked and killed by the beast. The tree holding the rope breaks and the three on the line fall into the water. They manage to swim back to the island, but as Allen crawls up the shore, the beast lunges out of the water and throws him back into the river, where he is dragged under.\n\nLater that night, Pete suggests hooking the beast while everyone else swims to the riverbank; Neil's two dead birds replace Kate's dog named Kevin, the initial bait idea. After a long wait, the anchor is suddenly pulled and the group make a break for the far shore. The beast eventually lets go of the bait, seizes Kate and drags her underwater. Pete hurries across the river with Kevin in tow and into the bush behind the others.\n\nAs day breaks, Pete is forced to chase Kevin into the bush after he runs off. He falls down a narrow chute into a large cave, where he discovers Neil's partial corpse. The cave is the beast's lair and the dog leads him to a badly injured Kate. Pete attempts to carry her out but Kevin runs off to the head of the cave, where it is heard being seized by the beast. After several attempts on them both, the beast takes a chunk out of Pete's hand. Pete eventually props a large broken log against a boulder, with the sharp end pointing outwards, so when the beast lunges at him, it is impaled and dies. Pete escapes from the cave with Kate and finds the tourists and paramedics.\n\nAs the credits roll, the camera focuses on a newspaper article detailing Pete's heroic battle with the beast and rescue of Kate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Michael Vartan]] as Pete McKell\n*[[Radha Mitchell]] as Kate Ryan\n*[[Sam Worthington]] as Neil Kelly\n*[[Caroline Brazier]] as Mary Ellen\n*[[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]] as Simon\n*[[Celia Ireland]] as Gwen\n*[[John Jarratt]] as Russell\n*[[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]] as Collin\n*[[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]] as Everett Kennedy\n*[[Heather Mitchell]] as Elizabeth Smith\n*[[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]] as Allen Smith\n*[[Mia Wasikowska]] as Sherry Smith\n*[[Barry Otto]] as Merv\n\n{{div end}}\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n''Rogue'' was released on DVD in Australia on 29 May 2008.<ref>[http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/797273 Rogue @ EzyDVD<!-- Bot generated title -->].
