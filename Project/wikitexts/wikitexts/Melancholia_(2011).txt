The film's story revolves around two sisters, one of whom marries just before a [[rogue planet]] is about to collide with Earth. ''Melancholia'' is the second film in von Trier's unofficially titled ''Depression Trilogy''. It was preceded in 2009 by ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'' and followed by ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Post |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/03/20/nyphomaniac-volumes-i-and-ii-reviewed-lars-von-triers-sexually-graphic-pairing-will-titillate-but-fails-to-satisfy/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=nationalpost |language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 May 2011, ''Melancholia'' premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival|64th Cannes Film Festival]], where it was received with critical acclaim and Dunst received the festival's [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Award]] for her performance, which was a common area of praise among critics.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Lattanzio |first1=Ryan |date=2021-05-02 |title=Lars von Trier's 15 Best Feature Films Ranked |url=https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/lars-von-trier-best-films-ranked/ |access-date=2022-08-08 |website=IndieWire |language=en}}</ref> Although it has detractors, many critics and film scholars have considered the film to be a personal masterpiece; claiming that the film considered to be the best of the trilogy and one of the von Trier's best works.

Justine and Michael are late for the reception due to their stretch [[limousine]]'s difficulty traversing the narrow and winding rural road. Upon their arrival, Justine sees a star in the sky shining particularly brightly. John, an astronomy enthusiast, explains it is the star [[Antares]]. The festivities are less than harmonious; Justine's divorced parents Gaby and Dexter verbally abuse each other in front of the guests, and Justine, to John and Claire's annoyance, keeps wandering away. Justine's employer Jack, who announces her promotion to [[art director]] of his advertising firm, expects her to write a slogan for a new campaign during the celebration. Justine finds herself pushed into a role that others have chosen for her and falls back into [[Depression (mood)|depression]], from which she has been suffering for a long time. Towards the end of the party, which goes on until the early hours of the morning, she quits her job in an argument and calls off her marriage to Michael after cheating on him. Early the following morning, while horseriding with Claire, Justine notices [[Antares]] is no longer visible in the sky.\n\n===Part Two: Claire===\nJustine returns home with Claire, but sinks even further into depression, and is welcomed back to John and Claire's estate, where she struggles to leave her bed and is unable to eat. According to John, Antares's absence is due to the rogue planet \"Melancholia\". The planet appeared from behind the Sun and has passed in front of Antares. John announces that according to the scientists' calculations, Melancholia will pass in close proximity to Earth, but will not collide with it. Claire looks anxiously at Melancholia's path on the Internet, learning of a predicted collision with Earth. John tries to calm her down, but secretly secures food and gasoline. In view of the approaching planet, Claire increasingly loses her composure, while Justine longs for the end of the world and \"sunbathes\" naked in the glow of the planet at night.\n\nStrange omens pile up in the days that follow. The electricity in the castle goes out, the butler does not come to work, the horses in the stable are restless, [[St. Elmo's fire]]s emerge at various times, and the weather changes erratically. Melancholia initially flies past Earth, seemingly vindicating John. Melancholia then crosses Earth's orbit a second time, however, now moving directly towards Earth. Upon this discovery, John commits suicide by overdosing on pills. Claire hides his death from the family and attempts to flee with her son Leo, but the cars will not start. Justine declines to spend her final moments with Claire on the terrace by candlelight and wine. Instead, Justine calms Leo down by suggesting that they build a \"magic cave\" out of branches. Shortly before the collision, Justine, Claire and Leo sit under the \"cave\" and hold hands. While Justine and Leo seem apathetic to, or at peace with their impending doom, Claire panics and despairs. Melancholia finally collides with Earth, engulfing them in a sea of flames as both planets shatter against each other.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer    = Lead actresses [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] during the film's presentation at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].\n| image1    = Kirsten Dunst Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width1    = 129\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Charlotte Gainsbourg Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width2    = 130\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Justine\n* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as Claire\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Michael\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John, Claire's husband\n* Cameron Spurr as Leo\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Gaby, Justine and Claire's mother\n* [[John Hurt]] as Dexter, Justine and Claire's father\n* [[Jesper Christensen]] as Little Father, The Butler\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Jack, Justine's boss\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Tim\n* [[Udo Kier]] as The Wedding Planner\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Inspiration===\nVon Trier's initial inspiration for the film came from a [[Major depressive disorder|depressive episode]] he suffered.

Von Trier decided from the outset that it would be clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by [[Jean Genet]]. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in ''Melancholia''. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself.<ref name=\"pkinterview\">{{cite web |last=Thorsen |first=Nils |year=2011 |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/042199.pdf |title=Longing for the End of All |work=English press kit Melancholia |publisher=TrustNordisk |access-date=18 May 2011}}</ref> The name was inspired by the [[Marquis de Sade]] novel ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'' (1791).<ref name=\"iwinterview\">{{cite web |last=Feinstein |first=Howard |date=20 May 2011 |url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again |title=Lars von Trier: 'I will never do a press conference again.' |work=[[indieWire]] |publisher=[[SnagFilms]] |access-date=21 May 2011<!-- archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ypdVoXAv?url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again -->}}</ref>\n\n''Melancholia'' was produced by Denmark's [[Zentropa]], with co-production support from its subsidiary in Germany, Sweden's Memfis Film, France's Slot Machine, and Liberator Productions.<ref name=\"dfi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |title=Melancholia |work=Danish Films |publisher=[[Danish Film Institute]] |access-date=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214124319/http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |archive-date=14 February 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The production received 7.9 million [[Danish krone]]r from the [[Danish Film Institute]], 600,000 euro from [[Eurimages]],and 3 million [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] from the [[Swedish Film Institute]].<ref name=\"stoette\">{{cite web |last=Fil-Jensen |first=Lars |date=22 June 2010 |url=http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |title=St\u00f8tte til Caroline Mathildes \u00e5r og Melancholia |language=da |work=dfi.dk |publisher=[[Danish Film Institute]] |access-date=19 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902050051/http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |archive-date=2 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/ |title=Dramerna dominerar produktionsst\u00f6den i juni |last=Roger |first=Susanne |date=22 June 2010 |work=Filmnyheterna |publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]] |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008225753/http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=21 December 2010}}<!-- Link not working anymore.

Claro said about the method: \"[von Trier] wants to experience the situations the first time. He finds an energy in the scenes, presence, and makes up with the photographic aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"absurdteater\" /> Trier explained that the visual style he aimed at in ''Melancholia'' was \"a clash between what is romantic and grand and stylized and then some form of reality\", which he hoped to achieve through the hand-held camerawork.<ref name=\"pkinterview\" /> He feared, however, that it would tilt too much toward the romantic, because of the setting at the upscale wedding, and the castle, which he called \"super [[kitsch]]y\".<ref name=\"pkinterview\" /><ref name=\"svd\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe prelude to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' supplies the main musical theme of the film, and Trier's use of an overture-like opening sequence before the first act is a technique closely associated with [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. This choice was inspired by a 30-page section of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', where Proust concludes that Wagner's prelude is the greatest work of art of all time. ''Melancholia'' uses music more than any film by Trier since ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' from 1984. In some scenes, the film was edited in the same pace as the music. Trier said: \"It's kind of like a music video that way. It's supposed to be vulgar.\"<ref name=\"onlyredeeming\" /> Trier also pointed out parallels between both the film's usage of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and the film's editing to the music and the aesthetics of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=\"onlyredeeming\" />\n\nVisual effects were provided by companies in Poland, Germany, and Sweden under visual effects supervisor Peter Hjorth. Poland's Platige Image, which previously had worked with Trier on ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', created most of the effects seen in the film's opening sequence; the earliest instructions were provided by Trier in the summer 2010, after which a team of 19 visual effects artists worked on the project for three months.<ref>{{cite web |author=Staff writer |date=10 May 2011 |url=http://community.platige.com/news/532?lng=en |title=Special effects for 'Melancholia' |work=Platige Image Community |access-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zIJk60cf?url=http://community.platige.com/news/532?lng=en |archive-date=8 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nIn his [[director's statement]], Trier wrote that he had started to regret having made such a polished film, but that he hoped it would contain some flaws which would make it interesting: <blockquote>\"I desired to dive headlong into the abyss of [[German romanticism]]&nbsp;...

Meanwhile, Gainsbourg, for whom the end of the world must seem positively pastoral after the horrors she went through in ''Antichrist'', locates in Claire a fragility that ensures she's more than a whipping girl for social satire.\" Sandhu brought up one reservation in the review, in which he gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars: \"there is, as always with Von Trier's work, a degree of intellectual determinism that can be off-putting;
