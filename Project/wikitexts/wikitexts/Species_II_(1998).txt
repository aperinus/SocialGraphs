The film is a sequel to ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'' (1995) and the second installment in the [[Species (franchise)|''Species'' series]]. The film stars [[Michael Madsen]], [[Natasha Henstridge]], [[Marg Helgenberger]], [[Mykelti Williamson]], [[George Dzundza]], [[James Cromwell]] and [[Justin Lazard]]. In addition to Madsen and Helgenberger reprising their roles, Henstridge also returned for the sequel as a new character. The plot has Patrick Ross, the astronaut son of a senator, being infected by an extraterrestrial organism during a mission to [[Mars]] and causing the deaths of many women upon his return. To stop him, the scientists who created the human-extraterrestrial hybrid Sil in the original ''Species'' try using a more docile clone of hers, Eve.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on April 10, 1998. It was both a commercial and a critical failure compared to its predecessor, only grossing $26.8 million while having the same production budget as its predecessor. Despite this, a sequel, ''[[Species III]]'', was released in 2004, though it was made-for-television.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|section|date=March 2021}}\nCommander Patrick Ross leads a [[Human mission to Mars|crewed mission]] to [[Mars]]. Soil samples collected by the [[astronaut]]s unwittingly contain an alien-based substance which thaws aboard their capsule due to the change in temperature and contaminates them, causing a seven-minute contact gap with [[mission control]]. With seemingly no subsequent negative effects, the three astronauts return to Earth to public celebration. Only an institutionalized former scientist, Dr. Cromwell, reacts to their return with violent panic. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker has created a clone of Sil named Eve, whose alien DNA is suppressed to make her more docile. Her team conducts experiments on Eve, hoping to find a way to combat the alien species should it ever return to Earth. Every experiment is unsuccessful as Eve's biology adapts.\n\nUpon their return, the team members are told to refrain from sexual activity for ten days. Patrick disregards this advice and has a [[threesome]] with two sisters Marcy and Lucy following a fundraiser. During sex with Lucy, he begins to sprout tentacles. Lucy notices his transformation while she is stroking his body and is horrified at the sight of him, whereupon she tries to free herself from his clutches. She pleads with him to stop but he ignores her pleas as he proceeds to climax. The hyper-fertile alien seed within Marcy and Lucy causes them both to experience accelerated pregnancies, culminating when Patrick's half-alien children violently burst from their abdomens. Patrick hides his rapidly growing sons on the property of his father, [[United States Senator|Senator]] Judson Ross. Each time Patrick has sex, Eve experiences [[sexual arousal]]. The next day, Patrick tells his father he cannot remember the previous night's events. Senator Ross indicates that he is aware of Patrick's behavior and tells him to focus on his political goals.\n\nDr. Orinsky, one of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] scientists who examined Patrick, discovers something amiss about his blood sample and desperately tries to contact Cromwell. However, Orinsky is ambushed and disemboweled by something formed from Patrick's blood. Laura discovers that the DNA in Orinsky's wounds is distinct from Eve's, making her an unlikely culprit in the murder. This prompts Colonel Burgess, the military commander in charge of her project, to reunite her with Press Lennox to contain the new threat. Press and Laura seek out Cromwell, Orinsky's former professor, and learn that he discovered that the alien species had attacked and destroyed Mars in ancient times. Because of his fears that alien DNA might remain on Mars to infect anyone who visited the planet in the future, Cromwell urged the government to abort the mission, but was committed to an institution to permanently silence him. Cromwell then states that the night Orinsky tried to contact him was to confirm that he was right all along.\n\nPress and Laura identify the Mars astronauts as the prime suspects. Unable to find Patrick, they pursue the other astronauts, Anne Sampas and Dennis Gamble. They arrive too late to prevent Anne from making love with her husband, resulting in her impregnation with hybrid offspring. A tentacle-like creature bursts from Anne's abdomen and kills her husband before Press and Laura manage to kill the monster. Meanwhile, a second team of agents makes it in time to locate and examine Dennis, and confirm he is not infected. Laura discovers that Anne's hybrid DNA does not match that in Orinsky's wounds, meaning Patrick is the killer. Meanwhile, Patrick makes out with his girlfriend, resulting in her death through the birth of another hybrid son named Portus. Horrified at killing her, Patrick attempts suicide by shotgun, but the alien DNA regenerates his head and restores him back to life and temporarily destroys his human side, with the drive to mate with as many women as possible. Dennis witnesses this and tells Press and Laura what he saw, remembering what happened in the capsule and joining them in their mission. Patrick begins impregnating as many women as he can, hiding his victims and up to twenty children on his father's property.\n\nLaura is ordered to activate Eve's alien DNA so she can [[telepathy|telepathically]] track Patrick, but this makes her volatile and strengthens her alien instincts. Patrick surrenders to Press and Dennis after attempting to rape Darlene, whereupon he becomes aware of Eve; they take him to the lab despite their suspicion. As Patrick is taken to custody, Eve shows signs of being in heat. Patrick demands Laura open Eve's cell and nearly kills her when she refuses, but Press and Dennis drive him off with a special gaseous weapon. Burgess confronts Ross with irrefutable proof of Patrick's infection and demands help in detaining Patrick. Suspicious that Patrick will instead be killed, Ross deduces that he is at the property and apologizes for treating his son so coldly. Patrick's human side briefly returns, but while he tearfully embraces his father, the alien DNA suddenly violently reasserts itself and kills the Senator. Ross's death completely destroys Patrick's humanity, and he helps his hybrid children to cocoon, so they will soon begin mating themselves and prepare to eradicate humanity.\n\nBack at the lab, Laura discovers Dennis was not infected because he is a carrier of [[sickle-cell disease]], as the species lacks immunity to human genetic diseases. While they plan to weaponize this weakness, Eve breaks out of her confinement to find Patrick. Press, Laura and Dennis pursue her, with Burgess and the military following. At the shed, they kill Patrick's offspring while Eve and Patrick transform into their alien forms and begin to mate. The mating stops when Press and Dennis intervene, allowing Eve to break free; Patrick, transformed into another alien form, apparently attacks Eve by forcing his tongue-tentacle down her throat. Patrick attempts to attack the team, but Press impales him in the back with a pitchfork coated in Dennis' blood, causing him to disintegrate and die.\n\nThe military escorts Press, Laura and the injured Dennis away. Eve's seemingly lifeless body is loaded into an ambulance, but shortly after, her womb begins to swell rapidly\u2014indicating her survival and impregnation by Patrick \u2014 while Portus, who somehow survived, watches. As the screen cuts to black, Eve's uterus bursts and her screaming is heard, leading into the events of the [[Species III|third film]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Natasha Henstridge]] as Eve\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Preston \"Press\" Lennox\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Dr. Laura Baker\n* [[James Cromwell]] as U.S. Senator Judson Ross\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Dennis Gamble\n* [[Richard Belzer]] as U.S. President\n* [[Justin Lazard]] as Patrick Ross\n* [[Sarah Wynter]] as Melissa\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Colonel Carter Burgess Jr.\n* [[Myriam Cyr]] as Anne Sampas\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Dr. Herman Cromwell\n* Nancy La Scala as Debutante sister Marcy\n* Raquel Gardner as Debutante sister Lucy\n* Kim Adams as Darlene\n* Nicholas Vota as Portus, Boy In Ambulance\n\n== Development ==\nWriter [[Chris Brancato]] was working with MGM on ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', and knew the studio was interested in making a follow-up to ''Species''. He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it, but once Brancato went to ''Species'' producer [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]], he asked to \"approach this from a different angle, so that we don't have a tired retread of the original, as sequels often are\". So Brancato took inspiration from ''The Manchurian Candidate'', where \"somebody on a mission comes back, apparently a hero, but actually with some terrible demon inside\", and as \"the notion of a grand, unexplored place was the planet [[Mars]]\", he made the first astronaut on Mars \u2013 as according to [[NASA]] scientists consulted by Brancato, human [[exploration of Mars]] was \"a possibility \u2013 just a very expensive one\" \u2013 be infected by alien DNA. Mancuso approved the idea, and thus Brancato explored how this new villain was one \"for whom we can briefly feel a strange, [[Larry Talbot|Wolf Man]]-like sympathy \u2013 he's not responsible for having been turned into a monster\" and had him face an alien woman similar to Sil, raising the doubt on whether they would battle or mate. As Natasha Henstridge was unconfirmed to return, Brancato wrote the new female, Eve, as if it was \"either Natasha or a similarly beautiful woman\".<ref name=brancato>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-251  |title=The Origin of Species|author=Howard Johnson, Kim|journal=Starlog|date=June 1998|pages=76\u201380}}</ref> Henstridge still liked the script enough and the idea of working with director Peter Medak to sign for the sequel.<ref name=eve>[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-251 All About Eve], ''Starlog'' 251 (June 1998)</ref> Brancato decided to bring back two of the surviving characters from ''Species'', [[Michael Madsen]]'s Press Lennox and [[Marg Helgenberger]]'s Dr. Laura Baker feeling they \"were essential to bring the audience back in\", but knowing [[Forest Whitaker]] was probably too busy to return as Dan Smithson, he wrote a similar African American character in the one eventually portrayed by [[Mykelti Williamson]].<ref name=brancato /> Mancuso had another script done simultaneously to Brancato's, which reportedly explored the cliffhanger at end of ''Species'' where a rat was infected after eating Sil's remains.<ref name=eve /> Mancuso brought in [[Peter Medak]], responsible for the 1980 horror film ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]''.<ref name=brancato />\n\nThe nature of the alien species is explored to a slightly greater extent in the second film. A professor claims that they originated in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (also called the Magellanic Galaxy), due to it apparently being the only other place carbon-based life forms have been discovered. It is also stipulated that they were a \"cancerous\" race that visited Mars millions of years ago and annihilated all life on its surface (which is described in the film as being Earth-like at that time) before leaving a remnant of their own DNA in its soil. This DNA was intended to be picked up by other visitors so that their species could continue to infect other inhabited planets.\n\nThe Species basically appear to be [[bipedal]] ([[humanoid]]) forms. Unlike other aliens in the ''Species'' series, however, Patrick Ross has two types of alien forms: mating form and combat form.<ref name=\"cinefantastique\">{{cite journal|url=https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Cinefantastique/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2030%20No%201%20%28May%201998%29.pdf|title= Making Species 2|journal=Cinefantastique|date=May 1998}}</ref>{{rp|30\u201331}}<ref name=\"SFX\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/SFX_38.pdf|title= Origin of the Species.|journal=SFX|date=May 1998}}</ref>{{rp|59}} Patrick's alien form for copulation is bipedal, humanoid, and male version of Eve's,<ref name=\"SFX\" />{{rp|55}}<ref name=\"cinefantastique\" />{{rp|24}} while Patrick's alien form for combat (so-called 'Fighting Patrick') is quadrupedal, bigger, and more 'brutish' in appearance than Eve.<ref name=\"cinefantastique\" />{{rp|30}} His second stage appearance is also similar to the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorphs]] of the ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' films; both were designed with input from [[H.

Domestically, the film grossed only $19.6 million from its $35 million budget and $26,817,565 overseas, making the film average at the box office and therefore was a major critical and [[box office bomb|commercial failure]].<ref>{{cite news|title= City of Angels' Takes Wing in Heavenly Opening Weekend|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=13 April 1998|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/13/entertainment/ca-38767|access-date=2010-12-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film received worse reviews than its predecessor.

He expressed his opinion that audiences had too much expectation as this was a very different sequel due to not continuing from the story with the alien-infected rat that survived the finale, which hinted at a sequel in the 1995 original. Medak also admitted being uncomfortable with the amount of nudity in the film but said it was for the purpose of the story.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}<!-- cite DVD and timestamp -->\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nTo coincide with the film, [[McFarlane Toys]] released an Eve and Patrick (in their alien form) action figure as part of their inaugural series of Movie Maniacs action figures.

King, one by Apollo 440, and 9 score pieces composed by Edward Shearmur.\n\n== Novelization ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nAs with the first film, [[Yvonne Navarro]] wrote a novelization based on the original screenplay which gives plot and character details not seen in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvonnenavarro.com/offerings.htm|title=Yvonne Navarro: Writer & Illustrator -- Stuff for Sale|work=yvonnenavarro.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvonnenavarro.com/specdoc2.htm|title=Species II: The Official Page for the novel by Yvonne Navarro|work=yvonnenavarro.com}}</ref> For example, the book tells how, due to limited knowledge of the outside world, Eve does not know if Superman is a real life personality or not. It is also hinted that she was able to learn a degree of martial arts by watching old action movies.\n\nIn the film, Eve is shot by soldiers, but after being briefly incapacitated her body regenerates and she continues to escape. Soldiers continue to shoot at her, but Eve manages to run past them; why she is unharmed is left unexplained. The book explains that her skin adapts (in a way similar to how her body adapts to the gas test earlier in the film), becoming bulletproof.\n\nOther details in the book that do not appear in the film include an earlier escape attempt by Eve and Patrick discovering new senses in a restaurant with his fianc\u00e9. In the novel, the debutante is a young, sexy, brown-eyed blonde, whereas in the film, she is an older woman who is a brunette. The debutante's sister in the novel isn't her sister but her best friend from college that often engaged in sexual games that involved seducing men.\n\nOther events that occurred in the novel that occurred in the movie happened before or after other events. For example, Patrick does not encounter the debutante at the fundraiser until after Orinsky is killed by him, and Cromwell is not visited by Laura and Press until they discover Orinsky's corpse.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''\n* ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]''\n* [[List of films set on Mars]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0120841}}\n* {{Mojo title|species2}}\n\n{{Species Films}}\n{{Peter Medak}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:Large Magellanic Cloud in fiction]]\n[[Category:Species (film series)]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:1990s monster movies]]\n[[Category:1998 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American splatter films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Edward Shearmur]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films about cloning]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Medak]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Mars in film]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Biological weapons in popular culture]]\n[[Category:American pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:1990s pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
