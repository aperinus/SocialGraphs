His girlfriend Emma, an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer, is pregnant with his child. One day, David returns from work to find a lawyer representing a sperm bank (where he gave 693 donations and earned a sum of $24,255 during his student years) who tells him that the clinic gave his samples to women in the clinic and that he has fathered 533 children. Of those, 142 have joined a [[class action]] lawsuit to force the fertility clinic to reveal the identity of \"Starbuck,\" the [[Pseudonym|alias]] he had used.\n\nDavid's friend and lawyer Brett represents him as he tries to keep the [[Record sealing|records sealed]]. He provides him with profiles of each party to the lawsuit; David searches for them, finding moments for [[Random act of kindness|random acts of kindness]]. He covers for a struggling actor at his job so he can audition for a role. He pretends to be a pizza delivery man when he sees his daughter fighting with her boyfriend and saves her life as she ODs on drugs. He considers identifying himself but, after the thugs assault his father, he allows Brett to counter-sue the sperm bank for punitive damages. He wins the lawsuit, receives $200,000, and keeps his identity a secret.\n\nDavid has regrets and thinks about revealing his identity. However, if he chooses to do so, he would lose the $200,000 that he won in the [[countersuit]]. Revealing to his father that he is Starbuck, his dad pays off David's debt. David finally reveals his identity on [[Facebook]]. Going to Emma's, he finds that she is going into premature labor. At the hospital, his baby is born, he proposes to Emma, and many of the children show up to see them.\n\nIn the closing sequence, David is shown to maintain contact with many of his children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as David Wozniak\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Brett\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as Emma\n* [[Andrzej Blumenfeld]] as Mikolaj Wozniak\n* [[Simon Delaney]] as Victor \n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Aleksy\n* [[Dave Patten]] as Adam<ref name=\"Poghosyan\">{{cite web|last=Poghosyan|first=Astghik Cin|title=Dave Patten Talks Delivery Man, Music and His New Book|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/19/dave-patten-talks-delivery-man-music-and-his-new-book/|publisher=Emertainment Monthly|access-date=20 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127021812/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/19/dave-patten-talks-delivery-man-music-and-his-new-book/|archive-date=27 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* [[Adam Chanler-Berat]] as Viggo \n* [[Britt Robertson]] as Kristen\n* [[Jack Reynor]] as Josh\n* Madison McGrew as Rachel\n* Amos VanderPoel as Taylor\n* [[Matthew Daddario]] as Channing \n* [[Jessica Williams (actress)|Jessica Williams]] as Tanya\n* [[Damian Young]] as Williams\n* [[Richard Poe]] as Loan Officer\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Mass Action Attorney\n* Alexander Flores as Teenage Clerk\n* [[Glenn Fleshler]] as Coffee Shop Owner\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Himself\n* [[Bill Maher]] as Himself\n* Stephen Ellis as 18th Century Professor\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is a [[remake]] of the 2011 French-Canadian film ''[[Starbuck (film)|Starbuck]]'' which was also directed by Scott; ''Starbuck'' was also the [[working title]] for the English-language production.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Vince-Vaughn-Comedy-Starbuck-Changes-Its-Title-Delivery-Man-33481.html |publisher=cinemablend.com |title=Vince Vaughan Comedy Starbuck Changes Its Title To The Delivery Man |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |date=October 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] began in October 2012 in the [[Hudson Valley]] of New York.
