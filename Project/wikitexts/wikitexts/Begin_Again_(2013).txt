Knightley plays a singer-songwriter who is discovered by a struggling record label executive (Ruffalo) and collaborates with him to produce an album recorded in public locations all over New York City.\n\nAfter the success of his 2007 musical film ''[[Once (film)|Once]],'' Carney wrote the script for ''Begin Again'' in 2010 and employed [[Gregg Alexander]] to compose most of the film's music. With a US$8 million budget, production began in July 2012 with filming taking place in various locations around New York City. The film premiered in September 2013 at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically on June 27, 2014, in conjunction with the release of the film's soundtrack. It has grossed over $63 million worldwide and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Lost Stars]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nFormerly successful record label executive Dan Mulligan lives in New York City, estranged from his wife Miriam and struggling to keep up with the changing music industry. After being fired, he goes on a drinking binge, leading him to a bar on the [[Lower East Side]] where he encounters Gretta James.\n\nGretta is a young, fiercely independent songwriter from England, just broken up with her longtime boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl. A newly successful musician, he's had an affair with a production assistant. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers to sign her to his former record label, and although initially refusing, she reconsiders and agrees.\n\nDan and Gretta meet with Saul, Dan's business partner and co-founder of the record label, but he does not see the same potential in her, turning her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes they produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around the city. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Steve (a [[Street performance|busker]] and an old best friend of Gretta's), Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and she takes his teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album.\n\nWhen Gretta sees Dave accepting an award on television, she criticizes him for selling out to the music industry and, with the help of Steve, she expresses her grievances with him in a song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, back in New York promoting his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums.\n\nGretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of \"[[Lost Stars]]\" (a love ballad she had written and composed for him as a Christmas present), and  believes the true meaning of the song has been lost. He tells her the audiences love the way he plays it, and that their energy fills the room. He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta insists it is not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the [[Gramercy Theatre]] that weekend so that she can see how his fans react to it.\n\nWhen the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. She demands Saul give Dan his job back and her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign on Gretta. Later, after receiving a text message from Dave reminding her of his concert and much consideration, Gretta arrives at the venue just in time to watch Dave play her original arrangement of the song.\n\nWatching him play, Greta is initially happy to hear their song as she envisioned, but when the audience starts to cheer as it climaxes, she realizes that too much has changed. She leaves the concert and cycles through the city with a feeling of newfound hope and closure as a dejected Dave continues to perform.\n\nAfterwards, Gretta visits Dan at his apartment as he prepares to move back home, having made amends with his wife. She tells him that she does not want him to release her album, instead preferring to distribute it online for $1. Although Dan returns to work with Saul, he agrees to let Gretta release the album online and helps her to promote the release. The next day, Saul jokingly fires Dan for promoting Gretta's album and informs him that it sold 10,000 copies on its first day of release.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Gretta James, a songwriter\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Dan Mulligan, a music producer\n* [[Adam Levine]] as Dave Kohl, Gretta's ex-boyfriend and a successful musician\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Miriam Hart, Dan's estranged wife\n* [[Hailee Steinfeld]] as Violet Mulligan, Dan and Miriam's fourteen-year-old daughter\n* [[James Corden]] as Steve, Gretta's best friend\n* [[CeeLo Green]] as Troublegum, a successful rapper who was discovered by Dan\n* [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey]] as Saul, Dan's long-time business partner\n* [[Rob Morrow]] as CEO\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Phillis\n* [[Aya Cash]] as Jenny\n* Jennifer Li as Mim\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = ''Begin Again'' marked actress [[Keira Knightley]]'s first singing role and singer [[Adam Levine]]'s first acting role in a film.\n| align     = right\n\n| image1    = KeiraKnightleyByAndreaRaffin2011 (cropped).jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (188 * 478 / 530) round 0}}\n| alt1      = Keira Knightley\n\n| image2    = AdamLevine2011.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (205 * 1008 / 1240) round 0}}\n| alt2      = Adam Levine\n}}\n\nDirector [[John Carney (director)|John Carney]] conceived the premise for ''Begin Again'' several years before he began to write the screenplay in 2010.<ref name=variety>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/john-carney-begin-again-1201246811/|title=Director John Carney Considered Casting Adele in 'Begin Again'|date=June 25, 2014|first=Ramin|last=Setoodeh|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 11, 2014|archive-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905072345/https://variety.com/2014/film/news/john-carney-begin-again-1201246811/|url-status=live}}</ref> The story was partly inspired by his own experiences as a musician in a band,<ref name=variety/> and from his impression of the [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) executives of record labels during the 1990s, which formed the basis of Dan's character.<ref name=stone>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/begin-agains-john-carney-on-manhattan-musicals-and-his-bono-project-20140624|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|title='Begin Again's John Carney on Manhattan, Musicals and His Bono Project|date=June 24, 2014|first=Katie|last=Van Syckle|access-date=October 11, 2014|archive-date=October 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022050450/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/begin-agains-john-carney-on-manhattan-musicals-and-his-bono-project-20140624|url-status=live}}</ref> Carney wrote the script, which was initially titled ''Can a Song Save Your Life?'', before he, [[Glen Hansard]], and [[Gregg Alexander]] began writing the songs;
