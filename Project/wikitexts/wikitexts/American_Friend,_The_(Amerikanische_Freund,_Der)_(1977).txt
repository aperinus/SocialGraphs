The film features [[Dennis Hopper]] as career criminal [[Tom Ripley]] and [[Bruno Ganz]] as Jonathan Zimmermann, a [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] picture framer whom Ripley coerces into becoming an assassin. The film uses an unusual \"natural\" language concept: Zimmermann speaks German with his family and his doctor, but English with Ripley and while visiting Paris.\n\n==Plot==\nTom Ripley ([[Dennis Hopper]]) is a wealthy American living in [[Hamburg]], Germany. He is involved in an artwork forgery scheme, in which he appears at auctions to bid on forged paintings produced by an accomplice to drive up the price. At one of these auctions, he is introduced to Jonathan Zimmermann ([[Bruno Ganz]]), a picture framer who is dying of leukemia. Zimmermann refuses to shake Ripley's hand when introduced, coldly saying \"I've heard of you\" before walking away.\n\nA French criminal, Raoul Minot ([[G\u00e9rard Blain]]), asks Ripley to murder a rival gangster. Ripley declines, but in order to get even for Zimmermann's slight, suggests Minot use Zimmermann for the job. Ripley spreads rumors that Zimmerman's illness has suddenly worsened. Minot offers Zimmerman a great deal of money to kill the gangster. Zimmermann initially turns Minot down, but becomes greatly distressed by the thought that he may not have long to live and wants to provide for his wife and son. He agrees to go to France with Minot for a second medical opinion. Minot arranges to have the results falsified to make Zimmermann expect the worst. Zimmermann agrees to shoot the gangster in a [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] station. Ripley visits Zimmermann in his shop before and after the shooting to get a picture framed. Zimmermann is unaware of Ripley's involvement in the murder plot, and the two begin to form a bond.\n\nMinot visits Ripley again to report his satisfaction with Zimmermann's performance. Ripley, who has grown to like Zimmerman, is appalled when Minot says he plans to have him murder another rival gangster, this time on a speeding train using a [[garrote]]. Before Zimmermann can complete the murder, the target's bodyguard catches him. Ripley appears on the train and overpowers him. Zimmermann and Ripley execute the target and the bodyguard. They meet outside and Ripley confesses to suggesting him to Minot, and declines Zimmermann's suggestion to keep half the money for the second hit. Ripley asks Zimmermann to tell Minot that he did the job on the train alone. Back home, Zimmermann argues with his wife, Marianne, who does not believe his stories of being paid to undergo experimental treatments.\n\nZimmermann has been receiving mysterious phone calls and suspects the Mafia is trying to find him. His fears grow worse when Minot tells him that his own flat was recently bombed. Ripley picks up Zimmermann and they drive to his mansion to wait for the assassins Ripley expects to appear. Ripley and Zimmermann ambush and kill the assassins. Ripley piles their bodies into the ambulance in which they arrived. Before he and Zimmermann can leave to dispose of the bodies, Marianne arrives and tells Zimmermann that the French medical reports are fake. Ripley explains that she and her husband can settle matters later, but now they need to dispose of the bodies. They drive to the sea, Ripley in the ambulance and Marianne driving her husband in their car. On an isolated beach, Ripley douses the ambulance with gasoline and sets fire to it. Zimmermann drives away with Marianne, abandoning Ripley. Moments later, he dies at the wheel; Marianne pulls the emergency brake and survives. At the beach, Ripley says to himself, \"We made it anyway, Jonathan. Be careful.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Tom Ripley]] \n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Jonathan Zimmermann \n* [[Lisa Kreuzer]] as Marianne Zimmermann \n* [[G\u00e9rard Blain]] as Raoul Minot \n* [[Nicholas Ray]] as \"Derwatt\"\n* [[Samuel Fuller]] as The American\n* [[Peter Lilienthal]] as Marcangelo\n* [[Daniel Schmid]] as Igraham\n* [[Jean Eustache]] as Friendly Man \n* [[Sandy Whitelaw]] as Doctor\n* [[Lou Castel]] as Rodolphe \n* Andreas Dedecke as Daniel\n* [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]] as Allan Winter\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWenders was a fan of Patricia Highsmith and wanted to adapt one of her novels to film, especially ''[[The Tremor of Forgery]]'' or ''[[The Cry of the Owl]]''. When he learned that the rights to these novels and Highsmith's other novels had been sold, he met with her and she offered him the unpublished manuscript of ''[[Ripley's Game]]'', which was published in 1974.<ref name=\"Schenkar, page 485\">Schenkar, page 485</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">''The American Friend'' DVD - Commentary by Wim Wenders, Dennis Hopper - Starz / Anchor Bay, 2003</ref> Wenders also uses elements of ''[[Ripley Under Ground]]'', though he did not have the rights to do so.\n\nWenders wanted to cast [[John Cassavetes]] as Ripley, who declined and suggested Hopper for the part. After casting Hopper, an experienced director, Wenders decided to cast directors in all the gangster roles, including [[G\u00e9rard Blain]], [[Nicholas Ray]], and [[Samuel Fuller]]. He disliked the title ''Ripley's Game'' and shot the film under the title ''Framed''.<ref name=\"Schenkar, page 485\"/> He also considered the title ''Rule Without Exception''. He credits Hopper with suggesting the title ''The American Friend''.<ref name=\"Schenkar, page 485\"/><ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nAmerican popular music is heard at several points in the film. Ripley quotes the song \"[[Ballad of Easy Rider]]\" from ''[[Easy Rider]]'', a film Hopper directed and starred in, and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|One More Cup of Coffee]]\" and \"[[I Pity the Poor Immigrant]].\" Zimmermann plays or sings songs by [[the Kinks]], \"Too Much on My Mind\" and \"Nothin' in the World Can Stop Me Worryin' 'Bout That Girl\", in his shop. ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'', Wenders's first full-length feature film, was dedicated to The Kinks. Ripley tells Zimmermann that he's \"bringing [[the Beatles]] back to Hamburg,\" and Zimmermann quotes their song \"[[Drive My Car (song)|Drive My Car]]\" later in the film.\n\n==Critical reaction==\nIn ''A Girl and a Gun: The Complete Guide to Film Noir'', David N. Meyer says: \"Though the plot may not make a whole lot of sense the first time around\u2014and the thick European accents of a couple of the major actors doesn't help\u2014''The American Friend'' is worth the effort. Few movies from any era or genre offer such rich characters, realistic human relationships, gripping action sequences, or sly humor.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=David N.

But then, to my great disappointment, she was quite disturbed by it, didn't conceal that either and didn't have anything good to say about it after the screening. I left utterly frustrated. Months later, I got a letter from her. She said she had seen the film a second time, this time in a public screening on the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] during a visit in Paris. And she had much better feelings about it now. ... And she was full of praise for Dennis Hopper, too, whom she had flat-out rejected the first time. She now wrote that my film had captured the essence of that Ripley character better than any other films. You can guess how relieved I was!\"<ref>Schenkar, page 485-6</ref> In a 1988 interview, Highsmith praised the film's \"stylishness\" and said the scenes on the train were \"terrific.\"<ref>Gerald Peary, \"[http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/ghi/highsmith.html Patricia Highsmith]\", ''[[Sight and Sound]]'', Spring 1988, Vol.75, No.2, pp.104-105, accessed 8 December 2015</ref>\n\nThe film was selected as the West German entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[50th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref> It was nominated for [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] by the U.S. [[National Board of Review]].<ref name=\"NBRMP\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1977/ |title=1977 Award Winners |date=2019 |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |access-date=18 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 50th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of German submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* ''[[Ripley's Game (film)]]'', a 2002 adaptation of the same novel\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Schenkar, Joan.
