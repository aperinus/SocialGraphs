Written by [[Casey Robinson]], the newspaper drama was based on ''The Bloody Spur'' by [[Charles Einstein]], which was inspired by the case of Chicago serial killer [[William Heirens]] (a.k.a. the \"Lipstick Killer\"). (The film even alludes to the crimes of Heirens in the script's dialogue, suggesting that the film's antagonist, also known as the \"Lipstick Killer\", is a copycat killer.)<ref>{{AFI film|id=52062|title=While the City Sleeps}}</ref> Five decades after the film's release, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \"Fritz Lang (''[[M (1931 film)|'M']]'') directs his most under-appreciated great film, more a social commentary than a straight crime drama.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=While the City Sleeps |last=Schwartz |first=Dennis |date=March 2, 2005 |url=https://dennisschwartzreviews.com/whilethecitysleeps/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a vicious killer attacking an innocent woman in her apartment. It soon becomes apparent this murderer is a serial killer.\n\nThe scene switches to elderly Amos Kyne, a news media mogul, who is on his deathbed (in his office) talking to the men in charge of his company's divisions: wire-service chief Mark Loving, newspaper chief Jon Day Griffith, and television chief \"Honest\" Harry Kritzer; Edward Mobley, TV anchorman for Kyne Inc., is also present. After Kyne dismisses the others, he talks with Mobley about his concerns regarding his empire after his death; Mobley has refused the top job many times and does so again during this conversation. He is due on the air in four minutes and walks over to turn on Kyne's TV. When he looks back, he sees the old man has died.\n\nAfter Kyne's death, the corporation goes to his son, Walter Kyne, whom his father resented and has never allowed into the business.\n\nDue to his lack of knowledge, and not wanting to take on all the work at the top by himself, Walter Kyne decides to create a new second-in-command position of Executive Director. He challenges Loving, Griffith and Kritzer to catch the serial killer who has been dubbed the \"Lipstick Killer\". The man who does will get the new job.\n\nThe job is a very lucrative and prestigious prize, and in order to secure it Griffith attempts to ally with his friend Mobley, who agrees to help although not interested in the job himself. Loving manipulates star writer Mildred Donner to cozy up to and get information out of Mobley. Kritzer may have an inside track, as he is having a secret affair with Walter Kyne's wife, Dorothy.  She is both his confidante and sweet-talks her husband on his behalf. Their love nest, however, happens to be across the hall from the apartment of Loving's secretary, Nancy Liggett, to whom Mobley becomes engaged.\n\nMobley receives inside information from his police friend, Lt. Kaufman. After a new murder, the two men devise a plan to set a trap by using Nancy as the bait, with Mobley taunting the Lipstick Killer on TV in order to bring him out into the open.\n\nTaking the bait, the Lipstick Killer follows Nancy to her apartment to attack her, but fails to get in. Mrs. Kyne happens to arrive just then and enters her apartment. The killer takes advantage of the open door and succeeds in attacking her. She fights him off and runs screaming to Nancy's apartment. The killer runs away, and after a chase that includes Mobley the police catch him. Through Kaufman, Mobley provides the scoop to Griffith, who makes sure to release it first in an [[newspaper extra|extra-edition]] newspaper and only then on the Kyne wire service, but still ahead of any competitors.\n\nIn all the commotion, Dorothy is recognized at the secret apartment and the adulterous affair is exposed. \"Honest\" Harry Kritzer wins the promotion because of the threat of blackmail against Kyne. As Mobley and Griffith discuss the aftermath of these events in a bar, Mobley announces that he has resigned. Kyne comes in and Mobley tells him what he thinks of him.\n\nThe movie ends with Mobley and Nancy having married in Florida, and learning from a local paper of an unexpected shakeup in the Kyne organization. Kritzer is out; the promotion has gone to Griffith; and Mobley is to be promoted in turn to replace him. The happy couple kiss, ignoring a ringing telephone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Edward Mobley\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Dorothy Kyne\n* [[George Sanders]] as Mark Loving\n* [[Howard Duff]] as Lt.

H. Weiler|Abe Weiler]] liked the film, especially the acting. He wrote: \"Since it is full of sound and fury, murder, sacred and profane love and a fair quota of intramural intrigue, a viewer is left wondering if the tycoons of the giant Kyne publishing combine ever bother to cover such mundane stories as the weather. But while this journalistic jamboree is more flamboyant than probable, a tight and sophisticated script by [[Casey Robinson]] and a clutch of professional performances make ''While the City Sleeps'' a diverting and workmanlike fiction.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/05/17/archives/screen-at-the-old-stand-hitchcocks-man-who-knew-too-much-bows.html |last=Weiler |first=Abe |work=The New York Times |title=Newspaper Story |date=May 17, 1956 <!--the review is signed \"A.W.\", which indicated Abe Weiler in the 1950s.

In 2011 it was released in the U.S. on [[DVD-R]] by the [[Warner Archive Collection]] (WAC). Internet review site ''DVD Beaver'' compared these releases, citing the Exposure release as superior due to the Warner Archive release being \"Single-layered and significantly softer. It also has some brightness boosting.\" The reviewer, Gary Tooze, also states that \"There are no extras, not even the trailer that is available on [the] Exposure disc\". The Exposure Cinema release is [[Open matte|open-matte]], while the Warner Archive release is in [[Super 35|Superscope]]. Warner Archive released a region-free Blu-ray on March 13, 2018, about which Tooze concludes, \"I love the film, but the HD - superior in quality - is a part of an underwhelming package - yet we must own it with no signs of a more complete Blu-ray release in the future, unless it comes from the UK or France.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Tooze |first=Gary |work=DVD Beaver |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film3/dvd_reviews52/while_the_city_sleeps_blu-ray.htm |title=While the City Sleeps |access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1956]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/reviews.php?id=9343 |title=While the City Sleeps |first=Adam |last=Micklethwaite |work=Eye For Film |date=September 28, 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0049949}}\n* {{Allmovie title|54262}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|id=2302|title=While the City Sleeps}}\n* {{AFI film|52062}}\n\n{{Fritz Lang}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:While The City Sleeps (1956 Film)}}\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:1950s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1950s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fritz Lang]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Herschel Burke Gilbert]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:RKO Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
