It is a co-production of [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and [[South Africa]]. The film stars [[Sharlto Copley]], [[Jason Cope]], and [[David James (actor, born 1972)|David James]], and was adapted from Blomkamp's 2006 short film ''Alive in Joburg''.\n\nThe film is partially presented in a [[found footage (film technique)|found footage]] format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]], [[xenophobia]] and [[social segregation]], begins in an [[alternate history|alternate]] 1982, when an alien spaceship appears over [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]. When a population of sick and malnourished insectoid aliens are discovered on the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Twenty years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson, who is about to try to escape from Earth with his son and return home, crosses paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van de Merwe leading the relocation. The title and premise of ''District 9'' were inspired by events in [[Cape Town]]'s [[District Six]], during the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] era.\n\nA [[viral marketing]] campaign for the film began in 2008 at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], while the theatrical trailer debuted in July 2009. ''District 9'' was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on 14 August 2009, in North America and became a financial success, earning over $210 million at the box office. It also received acclaim from critics, who praised the film's direction, performances, editing, visual effects, themes, and story, with some calling it one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/oscar-nominations/ |work=The New York Times |title=The 82nd Annual Oscar Nominations |date=2 February 2010 |access-date=1 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011036/http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/oscar-nominations/ |archive-date=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an alternate 1982, a giant extraterrestrial spaceship arrives on Earth and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg. After three months of inactivity, human investigators find over one million malnourished aliens (called \"[[Parktown prawn|prawn]]s\") inside, and the South African government relocates them to a terrestrial camp called District 9. However, over the years, it has turned into a slum, and locals from Earth often complain that the aliens are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans.\n\nFollowing unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a huge weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints MNU employee and his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ, and Christopher's friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last twenty years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan. They finally finish in Paul's shack, but when Wikus comes to the shack to serve Paul a relocation notice, Wikus finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his face while confiscating it. Paul is killed by Koobus Venter, a cruel leader of the MNU mercenaries.\n\nWikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm, which was injured after the fuel exposure and hidden under a large bandage. After playing down his symptoms (vomiting, nosebleed, headache, and fingernail loss), he passes out during a party celebrating his promotion. He is taken to a hospital, where his left hand is now discovered to have become a prawn claw, and transferred to the MNU lab, where researchers perform brutal experiments. They find out his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, which only works with the aliens' biology. Wanting to capture this human/alien hybrid before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders Wikus's body to be [[vivisect]]ed and harvested for its properties. Wikus overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Koobus Venter's forces hunt for him, a [[smear campaign|smear story]] is broadcast on television, one that reaches Tania, Wikus' wife and Smit's daughter, claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a [[sexually transmitted disease|contagious disease]] from copulating with aliens.\n\nWikus takes refuge in District 9, accidentally finding Christopher and the mother spaceship's concealed command module [[shuttlecraft|dropship]] underneath his slumhouse. Christopher explains to Wikus that the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the dropship. If he can get them in the dropship to the mothership, he can cure Wikus and reverse his physical transformation. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo, who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm because he believes it will grant him alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and, able to use it, escapes with a collection of weapons he and Christopher can use to attempt the retrieval of the alien fuel.\n\nWikus and Christopher then force their way through MNU to the lab and retrieve the fuel. However, after seeing the barbaric experiments MNU has performed on his people in the lab (including a dissected Paul), Christopher tells Wikus he must return home as fast as possible for help and cannot undo Wikus' mutation until he returns in three years, due to the limited supply of the fuel. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher down and attempts to fly the dropship module to the mothership himself, but Koobus Venter's forces shoot it down. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy, seizes Wikus, and brings him to Obesandjo, who prepares to chop off Wikus' prawn arm.\n\nMeanwhile, remaining hidden in the dropship, CJ remotely activates the mothership and a large mechanized battle suit located in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians, and Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries. Heading to the dropship, the two come under heavy human weapons fire, and Wikus stays behind to fend off the mercenaries, buying time for Christopher, who promises to return after three years and heal Wikus, to leave. After all of the other mercenaries are killed, Venter finally cripples the suit and is about to execute Wikus when slum aliens attack and dismember him alive. Christopher makes it into the dropship with CJ, and the dropship is levitated via a [[tractor beam]] back into the mothership, which Christopher then uses to leave Earth.\n\nHumanity is left to speculate whether or not Christopher will return to take all the remaining aliens back to their home world, or whether he will return to declare war on Earth. MNU's experiments on the alien population are exposed by Wikus' former trainee Fundiswa, and the aliens are moved to the new camp, named District 10. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive, and a now fully-transformed Wikus is shown in a junkyard crafting the flower for his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:SharltoCopleyCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|Sharlto Copley promoting the film at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] during July 2009]]\n[[File:DavidJamesFacesofHope.jpg|thumb|right|Veteran South African actor [[David James (South African actor)|David James]] portrayed Koobus Venter]]\n* [[Sharlto Copley]] as Wikus van de Merwe, a mild-mannered, bumbling, awkward [[bureaucrat]] at the MNU Department of Alien Affairs, who becomes infected with an alien fluid, slowly turning him into one of the \"prawns\".

According to director Neill Blomkamp, during the winter season, Johannesburg \"actually looks like [[Chernobyl]]\", a \"[[Nuclear holocaust|nuclear apocalyptic]] wasteland\". Blomkamp wanted to capture the deserted, bleak atmosphere and environment, so he and the crew had to film during the months of June through July. The film took a total of 60 days of shooting. Filming in December raised another issue in that there was much more rain. Due to the rain, there was a lot of greenery to work with, which Blomkamp did not want. Blomkamp had to cut some of the vegetation in the scenery to portray the setting as desolate and dark.\n\nThe film features many weapons and vehicles produced by the South African [[arms industry]], including the [[Vektor R4|R5]] and [[Vektor CR-21]] assault rifles, [[Denel NTW-20]] 20&nbsp;mm [[anti-materiel rifle]], [[Milkor BXP|BXP]] [[submachine gun]], [[Casspir]] [[armoured personnel carrier]], [[Ratel IFV|Ratel]] infantry fighting vehicle, [[Rooikat]] armoured fighting vehicle, [[Atlas Oryx]] helicopter and militarized [[Toyota Hilux]] [[Technical (vehicle)|\"technical\"]] pickup truck.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rule |first=Andrew |title=District 9 is one long sales pitch for South Africa's arms industry |url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/20029/district-9-one-long-sales-pitch-south-africa%E2%80%99s-arms-industry |work=The Week with First Post |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202013821/http://www.theweek.co.uk/politics/20029/district-9-one-long-sales-pitch-south-africa%E2%80%99s-arms-industry |archive-date=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=District 9, Movie, 2009 |url=http://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?id=1136608 |work=Internet Movie Cars Database |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619165745/http://www.imcdb.org/movie.php?id=1136608 |archive-date=19 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBlomkamp said no single film influenced ''District 9'', but cited the 1980s \"hardcore sci-fi/action\" films such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[RoboCop (1987 film)|RoboCop]]'' as subconscious influences.

The [[Documentary film|documentary]]-style and [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]-style cam footage was shot on the Sony EX1/EX3 XDCAM-HD. Additionally, the post-production team was warned that the most RED Camera footage they could handle a day was about an hour and a half.

According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, \"They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=District 9: the most disgusting aliens in film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6133598/District-9-the-most-disgusting-aliens-in-film.html|access-date=2021-09-16|website=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, \"Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired ... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't.\"<ref name=\"variety\" />\n\nBlomkamp originally sought to have [[Weta Digital]] design the creatures, but the company was busy with effects for ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. The director then decided to choose a Vancouver-based effects company because he anticipated making films there in the future and because [[British Columbia]] offered a tax credit. Blomkamp met with Image Engine and considered them \"a bit of a gamble\" since the company had not pursued a project as large as a feature film.<ref name=\"talks\">{{Cite news |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=4032 |title=Neill Blomkamp Talks ''District 9'' |work=VFXWorld  |date=14 August 2009 |access-date=31 August 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820182016/http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=4032 |archive-date=20 August 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Aside from the aliens appearing on the operating table in the medical lab, all of them were created using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] visual effects.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alfio|first1=Leotta|title=Peter Jackson|date=17 December 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=New York, USA|isbn=9781623569488|page=128|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/peter-jackson-9781623569488/|access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWeta Digital designed the 2{{frac|1|2}}-kilometre-diameter mothership<ref>[http://www.digital.cinefex.com/nxtbooks/cinefex/119/index.php?startid=31 Cinefex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929072436/http://www.digital.cinefex.com/nxtbooks/cinefex/119/index.php?startid=31 |date=29 September 2013 }} 119, page 31</ref> and the drop ship, while the exo-suit and the little pets were designed by [[The Embassy Visual Effects]].

Director Neill Blomkamp wanted a \"raw and dark\" score, but one that maintained its South African roots. This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with to be optimistic and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of [[taiko]] drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoover |first=Tom |title=Interviews: Clinton Shorter&nbsp;\u2013 The Music of District 9 |url=http://scorenotes.com/interviews.html |year=2009 |publisher=Score Notes |access-date=8 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909061811/http://scorenotes.com/interviews.html |archive-date=9 September 2009}}</ref> Both the score and soundtrack feature music and vocals from [[Kwaito]] artists.\n\n==Marketing==\nSony Pictures launched a \"Humans Only\" marketing campaign to promote ''District 9''.

Nicholas argues that a white saviour \"disempowers the film\u2019s allegory to apartheid that comments on the corruption of the South African government\" as well as the discrimination black South Africans dealt with during and post-apartheid. Making Wikus the \"white savior\" backtracks from the main message of ''District 9'' which is to show the audience the detrimental effects \"of colonialism brought by the Western world\". Another point Nicholas makes is that ''District 9'' is a \"stereotypical White Saviour film\". She states that the plot is about a white man working for the government, who has roots \"in South Africa's apartheid culture\", involuntarily joining the \"victims of apartheid\". In this case, instead of black people, it's prawns.<ref>{{cite web | first= Emilye| last= Denny | year= 2017 | url= https://www.challengingborders.com/there-is-no-need-for-a-white-savior-in-district-9/ | title= There is no need for a White Savior| work= ChallengingBorders.com | publisher=| accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nDoctor Shohini Chauduri wrote that ''District 9'' even echoes apartheid in its title, as it is reminiscent \"of [[District Six|District 6]] in Cape Town, declared a whites-only area under the Group Areas Act\".
