Vivian is hired to be Edward's escort for several business and social functions, and their relationship develops over the course of her week-long stay with him.\n\nThe film's title ''Pretty Woman'' is based on the 1964 song \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]]. It is the first film on-screen collaboration between Gere and Roberts; their second film, ''[[Runaway Bride (film)|Runaway Bride]]'', was released in 1999.\n\nOriginally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and prostitution in [[Los Angeles]], the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the [[box office]] and was the [[1990 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 1990]]. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the US ever for a romantic comedy,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9158072/Richard-Gere-Pretty-Woman-a-silly-romantic-comedy.html |title= Richard Gere: Pretty Woman a 'Silly Romantic Comedy' |first= Rosa |last= Prince |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= March 21, 2012 |location= London |access-date= April 4, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141109195441/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9158072/Richard-Gere-Pretty-Woman-a-silly-romantic-comedy.html |archive-date= November 9, 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref> with [[Box Office Mojo]] listing it as the number-one romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.<ref name=\"boxmojo\" /> The film received mixed reviews, though Roberts received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance, which catapulted her to stardom. In addition, screenwriter J. F. Lawton was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America Award|Writers Guild Award]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nEdward Lewis, a high-powered [[corporate raid]]er from New York, buys and dismantles struggling companies, selling off the assets for profit. He wants his girlfriend Jessica to accompany him during a business trip, but fed up with being his \"beck and call girl\", she breaks up with him. Leaving a business party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], Edward takes his lawyer's [[Lotus Esprit#X180 (1987) and derivatives|Lotus Esprit]] sports car and accidentally ends up on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in the city's [[red-light district]]. There he encounters [[sex work]]er Vivian Ward. As he is having difficulties driving a manual transmission car, he pays Vivian to drive him to the [[Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel]]. Edward then impulsively hires her for the night, and despite some awkwardness, finds her charming and gets on\n\nThe next day, Edward asks Vivian to play his girlfriend that week at a series of business events he is attending while attempting a takeover of shipbuilder James Morse's company. Edward offers Vivian $3,000 and a new wardrobe for six days. Vivian excitedly accepts, but when she attempts to go shopping on [[Rodeo Drive]], she is turned away by the rude, snobbish saleswomen and turns to Barney, the hotel's manager, for help. He teaches her proper etiquette and arranges for her to buy a cocktail dress for an important business dinner that evening. At the dinner meeting Edward introduces Vivian to James and his grandson David; the latter is being groomed to take over the company after his grandfather dies. The business meeting does not go well and James and David are unimpressed by Edward wanting to buy and sell off their company. Edward is impressed by Vivian's transformation and opens up to her, revealing details about his personal and business life, including his turbulent relationship with his late father, Carter, from whom he was estranged at the time of his death.\n\nWhen Edward's attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy after seeing her talking to David at a polo game, Edward reveals how they met. Phillip later crudely propositions Vivian for her services after Edward is finished with her. Vivian is hurt and furious at Edward for exposing her. Edward apologizes, revealing he was jealous of Vivian talking to David and realizes Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on him. Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see ''[[La traviata]]'' at the [[San Francisco Opera]]. The story of a sex worker who falls in love with a rich man moves Vivian. She later breaks her \"no kissing\" rule while having sex with Edward. After mistakenly believing Edward is asleep, Vivian admits she loves him.\n\nHis return to New York imminent, Edward offers to help Vivian get off the streets and suggests putting her up in a nice condo and giving her an allowance, promising to visit her regularly. Vivian is offended by the offer, as Edward is still treating her like a sex worker, and recalls a childhood fantasy of being rescued from her abusive home by a knight on a white steed. Edward meets with James but, changed by his experience with Vivian, chooses to work with him to save his company instead of dismantling it. Phillip, furious that Edward's new direction has cost him a fortune, goes to the hotel to confront him but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for Edward's changing character, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives and punches Phillip, then fires him.\n\nWith his business in Los Angeles complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay with him one more night, but only if she wants to, not because he is paying her. She gently refuses and leaves. Edward re-thinks his life, and while being driven to the airport has the chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building. He climbs out through the white limousine's sunroof and ascends the fire escape to rescue Vivian just like the knight in her fantasy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Edward Lewis, a rich corporate raider from New York\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Vivian Ward, a free-spirited [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] [[sex work|sex worker]] whom Edward hires to be his escort for a week\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as James Morse, owner of a troubled shipbuilding company Edward plans to take over\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Phillip Stuckey, Edward's insensitive lawyer\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Barnard \"Barney\" Thompson, the dignified and soft-hearted hotel manager\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Kit De Luca, Vivian's sarcastic wisecracking best friend and roommate who taught her the sex work trade\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as David Morse, James Morse's grandson, who is being groomed to take over the company\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Elizabeth Stuckey, Phillip's wife\n* [[Elinor Donahue]] as Bridget, a friend of Barney Thompson who works in a women's clothing store\n* [[John David Carson]] as Mark Roth, a businessman in Edward's office\n* [[Judith Baldwin]] as Susan, one of Edward's ex-girlfriends whom he runs into at Phil's party at the beginning of the film.
