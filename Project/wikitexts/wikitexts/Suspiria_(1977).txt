The film stars [[Jessica Harper]] as an American ballet student who transfers to a prestigious dance academy but realizes, after a series of brutal murders, that the academy is a front for a supernatural conspiracy. It also features [[Stefania Casini]], [[Flavio Bucci]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Udo Kier]], and [[Joan Bennett]], in her final film role.\n\nThe film is the first of the trilogy Argento refers to as ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which also comprises ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007). ''Suspiria'' has received a positive  response from critics for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colors and its [[Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)|score]] by Argento and the [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].\n\n''Suspiria'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Bennett in 1978, and Best DVD Classic Film Release, in 2002. It is recognised as one of the most influential films in the [[horror film|horror genre]]. It served as the inspiration for a 2018 [[Suspiria (2018 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Luca Guadagnino]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSuzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives in Freiburg, [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], Germany during a torrential downpour to study at the [[co-ed]] Tanz Akademie, a prestigious German dance school. She sees another student, Pat Hingle, flee the school in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town overnight. Pat takes refuge at a friend's apartment and tells her that something sinister happened at the school. Pat is ambushed by a shadowy figure who stabs her repeatedly and drags her to the roof of the apartment building before hanging her with a noose by throwing her through the building's [[skylight]]. Pat's friend is also killed after being impaled by a falling giant shard of glass while trying to alert other tenants to the murder.\n\nSuzy returns to the school the next morning, where she meets Miss Tanner, the head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to Pavlos, one of the school's servants. She also meets classmates Sarah and Olga, her new roommate. Suzy experiences an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before passing out during a dance class. When she regains consciousness, Suzy learns that Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to live at the school with Sarah in the room next door.\n\nWhile the students are preparing for supper one night, [[maggot]]s rain down from the ceilings of their rooms due to a shipment of spoiled food in the attic, forcing them to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter. Sarah, frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing, recognizes her as the school's headmistress, who is supposedly out of town. The school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his [[German Shepherd]] bites Albert. Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza that night; his dog turns on him and viciously rips out his throat.\n\nSarah tells Suzy that she was the one on the intercom who refused her entry the night Pat was murdered. She reveals that Pat was behaving strangely before her death and promises to show Suzy the notes that she left behind. Sarah finds that Pat's notes are missing and is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. They pursue her through the school before cornering her in the attic. She escapes through a small window before falling into a pit of [[Barbed tape|razor wire]], entangling her and allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.\n\nSuzy investigates Sarah's disappearance the next morning. Tanner tells her that Sarah has fled the school. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sarah's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel. He reveals that the school was established by Greek [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]e Helena Markos in 1901, who was allegedly a [[witch]]. Suzy also consults with Professor Milius, a professor of the [[occult]]. He reveals that a [[coven]] of witches perishes without their leader, from whom they draw power.\n\nWhen Suzy returns to the school, she finds that everyone has left to attend the [[Bolshoi Ballet]]. After being attacked by a bat and recalling a conversation with Sarah about footsteps, she follows the sound of them carefully, leading her to Madame Blanc's office. Remembering that Pat uttered the words ''secret'' and ''iris'' the night that she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door that opens by turning a blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office. Suzy enters the corridor and finds the academy's instructors, led by Madame Blanc, plotting her demise in the form of a [[human sacrifice]]. Albert alerts Pavlos to Suzy's presence. Suzy hides in an alcove, where she finds Sarah's disfigured corpse.\n\nPursued by Pavlos, Suzy retreats to Helena Markos's bedroom. Suzy finds Markos sleeping, recognizing her as the headmistress by her labored breathing. She accidentally wakes her by breaking a decorative [[peacock]] with crystal plumage. Markos renders herself [[Invisibility in fiction|invisible]] and taunts Suzy before [[Necromancy|reanimating Sarah's mutilated corpse]] to murder her. When flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, Suzy impales her through the neck with one of the peacock's broken glass quills. Markos's death causes Sarah's corpse to vanish.\n\nSuzy flees as the school starts to implode. Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlos and the rest of the coven perish without the power of Markos to sustain them. Suzy escapes into the rainy night as the school is consumed by fire.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Suzy Bannion\n* [[Stefania Casini]] as Sara Simms\n* [[Flavio Bucci]] as Daniel\n* [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as Mark ([[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in the English release by [[Gregory Snegoff]])\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Miss Tanner\n* [[Joan Bennett]] as Madame Blanc\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Dr. Frank Mandel (dubbed by Frank von Kugelgen)\n* [[Barbara Magnolfi]] as Olga Ivanova (dubbed by [[Carolyn De Fonseca]])\n* Eva Ax\u00e9n as Patricia \"Pat\" Hingle\n* [[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]] as Professor Milius (dubbed by [[Geoffrey Copleston]])\n* [[Susanna Javicoli]] as Sonia\n* [[Franca Scagnetti]] as Cook\n* Giuseppe Transocchi as Pavlos (credited as Pavlo)\n* Jacopo Mariani as Albert\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Professor Verdegast\n* Margherita Horowitz as Teacher\n* Giovanni Di Bernardo as Police Inspector (dubbed by [[Ted Rusoff]])\n* Lela Svasta as Mater Suspiriorum/Helena Markos (uncredited)\n* [[Dario Argento]] as Narrator (uncredited) (dubbed by William Kiehl) (uncredited)}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nArgento based ''Suspiria'' in part on [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s essay ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845).{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=146}}{{sfn|Cooper|2012|p=88}} Critic Maitland McDonagh notes: \"In Argento's reading [of the material], the three mothers generate/inhabit a cinematic world informed by [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] archetypal imagery, each holding sway over a particular city.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=29}} Argento said the idea for the film came to him after a trip through several European cities, including [[Lyon]], [[Prague]], and [[Turin]].<ref name=25th>{{cite AV media|title=Suspiria 25th Anniversary|year=2001|people=Hertz, Gary (director)|display-authors=etal|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330950/}}</ref> He became fascinated by the \"Magic Triangle,\" a point where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet; this is where [[Rudolf Steiner]], a controversial social reformer and [[occult]]ist, founded an [[anthroposophic]] community.<ref name=25th /> Commenting on witchcraft and the occult, Argento stated: \"There's very little to joke about.

for the film, which combined the occult themes that interested Argento with [[fairytales]] that were inspiring to Nicolodi, such as ''[[Bluebeard]]'', ''[[Pinocchio]]'', and ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=25th /> Nicolodi also partially based her contributions to the screenplay on a personal story her grandmother had told her, in which her grandmother had gone to take a piano lesson at an unnamed academy where she believed she encountered [[black magic]].<ref name=25th /> The encounter terrified her grandmother, prompting her to flee.<ref name=25th /> This story, however,

performance in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974).<ref name=25th /> Upon being cast in the film, Harper watched Argento's ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1971) to better understand the director's style.<ref name=25th /> Harper turned down a role in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) in order to appear in the film.<ref name=tcm />\n\nArgento requested Italian actress [[Stefania Casini]] for the supporting role of Sarah, a request which she obliged, having been an admirer of his films.<ref name=25th /> Daria Nicolodi had originally planned on playing the role of Sarah, but was unable to due to an injury, and Casini was brought in at the last minute.<ref name=25th /> German actor [[Udo Kier]] was cast in the minor supporting role of Frank Mandel.<ref

at De Paoli studios in Rome, where key exterior sets (including the fa\u00e7ade of the academy) were constructed.{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=133}} Actress Harper described the film shoot as \"very, very focused\", as Argento \"knew exactly what he was looking for\".<ref name=25th /> The fa\u00e7ade of the academy was replicated on a soundstage from the real-life [[The Whale House|Whale House]] in Freiburg.<ref name=25th /> Additional photography took place in [[Munich]], including Daniel's death scene in the city square, as well as the opening scene of the film, which was shot on location at the [[Munich Airport]].<ref name=25th /> The scene in which Suzy meets with Dr. Mandel was filmed outside the [[BMW Headquarters]] building in Munich.<ref name=25th />\n\n''Suspiria'' is noteworthy for several stylistic flourishes that have become Argento trademarks, particularly the use of [[Set piece|set-piece]] structures that allow the camera to linger on pronounced visual elements.{{sfn|Bondanella|2009|p=323}} Cinematographer [[Luciano Tovoli]] was hired by Argento to shoot the film, based on color film tests he had completed, which Argento felt matched his vision, in part inspired by ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' (1937).<ref name=25th /> The film was shot using [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic lenses]]. The [[production design]] and [[cinematography]] emphasize vivid [[primary color]]s, particularly red, creating a deliberately unrealistic, nightmarish setting, emphasized by the use of [[imbibition]] [[Technicolor]] prints. Commenting on the film's lush colors, Argento said: <blockquote>We were trying to reproduce the colour of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1937 film)|Snow White]]''; it has been said from the beginning that Technicolor lacked subdued shades, [and] was without nuances\u2014like cut-out cartoons.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=138}}</blockquote>\n\nThe imbibition process, used for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), is much more vivid in its color rendition than emulsion-based release prints, therefore enhancing the nightmarish qualities of the film Argento intended to evoke.<ref name=25th /> It was one of the final feature films to be processed in Technicolor, using the last remaining machine in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/arts/dario-argentos-suspiria-visual-aural-masterwork/ |title=Dario Argento's Suspiria: A Visual and Aural Masterwork | publisher = Indiana Public Media |date=2009-05-21 |access-date=2017-12-18|author=jrhodes}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\n==== Dubbing ====\nAll of the actors' dialogue was dubbed through [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]]\u2014a common practice in Italian filmmaking at the time.<ref name=25th /> Argento expressed disappointment over the fact that Harper's voice, which he liked, was not heard in the Italian market because she was dubbed in Italian by another actress.{{citation needed|date = April 2021}} The dubbing was overseen by [[Ted Rusoff]], a prolific [[Voice Over Artist|voiceover artist]] based in Rome who supervised English-language dubbing for numerous European genre films including Argento's follow-up to ''Suspiria'', [[Inferno (1980 film)|''Inferno'']].{{citation needed|date = April 2021}}\n\nContrary to the conventional wisdom that ''Suspiria'' is entirely post-synced, the English-language mix is actually not entirely dubbed and uses a fair amount of production dialogue recorded on set, mixed with post-synced ADR.  Actors whose actual on-set recorded voices appear in some scenes of the English mix are Jessica Harper, Alida Valli, Joan Bennet, Miguel Bos\u00e9, and Flavio Bucci.{{citation needed|date = November 2020}}\n\n==== Musical score ====\n{{Main|Suspiria (1977 soundtrack)}}\nThe Italian [[progressive rock]] band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] composed most of the film's [[Film score|score]] in collaboration with Argento himself.<ref name=25th /> Goblin had scored Argento's earlier film ''[[Deep Red]]'' as well as several films following ''Suspiria''. In the film's opening credits, they are referred to as \"The Goblins\".<ref name=25th /> Like [[Ennio Morricone]]'s compositions for [[Sergio Leone]], Goblin's score for ''Suspiria'' was created before the film was shot.<ref name=\"25th\" /> It has been reused in multiple [[Hong Kong]] films, including [[Yuen Woo-ping]]'s [[Hong Kong martial arts film|martial arts film]] ''[[Dance of the Drunk Mantis]]'' (1979) and [[Tsui Hark]]'s horror-comedy ''[[We're Going to Eat You]]'' (1980).\n\nThe main title theme was named as one of the best songs released between 1977 and 1979 in the book ''[[The Pitchfork 500]]: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present'', compiled by music website [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]].
