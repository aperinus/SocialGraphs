The widescreen cinematography was by [[Tonino Delli Colli]], and the acclaimed [[film score]] was by [[Ennio Morricone]].\n\nAfter directing ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', Leone decided to retire from [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and aimed to produce his film based on ''The Hoods'', which eventually became ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''. However, Leone accepted an offer from [[Paramount Pictures]] providing Henry Fonda and a budget to produce another Western. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After [[Clint Eastwood]] turned down an offer to play the movie's protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations.\n\nThe original version by the director was 166 minutes <!-- (2 hours and 46 minutes) --> when it was first released on 21 December 1968. This version was shown in European cinemas, and was a box-office success. For the US release on 28 May 1969, ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' was edited down to 145 minutes <!-- (2 hours and 25 minutes) --> by Paramount and was a financial flop. The film is the first installment in Leone's ''Once Upon a Time'' trilogy, followed by ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' and ''Once Upon a Time in America'', though the films do not share any characters in common.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fistful-dynamite-duck-you-sucker-sergio-leone |title=The film with three names \u2013 in praise of Sergio Leone's neglected spaghetti western |website=[[British Film Institute]] |date=24 April 2018 |access-date=2 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602154820/https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fistful-dynamite-duck-you-sucker-sergio-leone|archive-date=2 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{Cite news |title=25 new titles added to National Film Registry |newspaper=Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo |agency=Associated Press |date=30 December 2009 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance |access-date=30 December 2009|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106004526/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_en_mo/us_classic_films_glance |archive-date=6 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-07|archive-date=7 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507094100/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nThe story develops around two plot lines set in the [[Old West]] town of \"Flagstone.\" First, a man dubbed \"Harmonica\" seeks revenge against the outlaw, Frank. Second, Frank works as a hired gun for railroad tycoon, Morton, who is trying to acquire certain land owned by the Brett McBain family. A second outlaw, Cheyenne, also figures into the story.\n\nHarmonica kills three men who ambush him on his arrival at the train station. The [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] they wear lead him to believe they are Cheyenne's men. Meanwhile, Frank and his henchmen kill Brett McBain and his three children at their ranch, which they call \"Sweetwater.\" Frank leaves behind evidence to frame Cheyenne for the murders.\n\nA woman named Jill arrives in Flagstone, en route to Sweetwater, for what is assumed to be her upcoming marriage to McBain. However, Jill, a New Orleans prostitute, actually married McBain when he was there, thus making her the sole heir to Sweetwater. McBain knew the railroad would pass through Sweetwater one day, and he planned to build a watering station on his property, subject to a reverter that McBain would forfeit Sweetwater if the station was not built by the time the railroad reached that point. Morton sent Frank to intimidate McBain, but McBain's murder and Jill's inheritance put Morton and Frank at odds. Morton wants to make a deal with Jill, but Frank wants the land for himself.\n\nCheyenne denies his men tried to ambush Harmonica, and the two realize Frank is behind both the ambush and framing Cheyenne for the McBain murders. Harmonica discovers the connection between Frank and Morton, but is captured by Frank's men. When Frank asks Harmonica's identity, he replies with names of men Frank has killed. Cheyenne rescues Harmonica, and the two collaborate to help Jill save Sweetwater.\n\nJill decides to auction the land and return to New Orleans; however, Frank's henchmen intimidate the bidders in order to purchase the land at low value. Harmonica appears with Cheyenne in tow and bids $5,000, which is the price on Cheyenne's head as a wanted fugitive. Morton hires Frank's own men to kill him, but Harmonica intervenes to save Frank's demise for himself. Meanwhile, Cheyenne escapes custody, and he and his gang engage Frank's remaining gang in a gunfight at Morton's train. Except for Cheyenne, who heads to Sweetwater, all are killed, including Morton.\n\nFrank sees the aftermath of the gunfight and rides to Sweetwater where he finds Harmonica waiting. Cheyenne has arrived, too, but remains in the ranch house with Jill. Harmonica beats Frank to the draw. As Frank lies dying, he again asks Harmonica's identity. Through a flashback, it is revealed Frank shoved a harmonica in a boy's mouth just before the boy collapsed under the weight of his older brother, whom Frank was hanging. In the present, Harmonica returns the instrument to Frank by placing it in ''his'' mouth. Frank realizes who shot him and dies.\n\nHarmonica and Cheyenne leave Sweetwater, but Cheyenne collapses and dies from a gut wound he received by Morton in the gunfight. As Harmonica departs, Jill serves water to the railroad workers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Jill McBain\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Frank\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Manuel \"Cheyenne\" Guti\u00e9rrez\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as \"Harmonica\"\n* [[Gabriele Ferzetti]] as Mr. Morton\n* [[Paolo Stoppa]] as Sam, the Coachman\n* Marco Zuanelli as Wobbles\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as the Sheriff of Flagstone\n* [[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]] as Brett McBain\n* [[Lionel Stander]] as the barman\n* [[Woody Strode]] as Stony, first gunman\n* [[Jack Elam]] as Snaky, second gunman\n* [[Al Mulock]] as Knuckles, third gunman\n* Enzo Santaniello as Timmy McBain\n* Simonetta Santaniello as Maureen McBain\n* Stefano Imparato as Patrick McBain\n* [[Benito Stefanelli]] as Frank's Lieutenant\n* [[Aldo Sambrell]] as Cheyenne's Lieutenant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Origins===\nAfter making his American Civil War epic ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', Leone had intended to make no more Westerns, believing he had said all he wanted to say. He had come across the novel ''The Hoods'' by the pseudonymous \"[[Harry Grey]]\", a fictionalized book based on the author's own experiences as a Jewish hood during [[Prohibition]], and planned to adapt it into a film (17 years later, it would become his final film, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''). Leone, though, was offered only Westerns by the Hollywood studios. [[United Artists]] (which had produced the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'') offered him the opportunity to make a film starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Kirk Douglas]], and [[Rock Hudson]], but Leone refused.  When Paramount offered Leone a generous budget along with access to Henry Fonda\u2014his favorite actor, and one with whom he had wanted to work for virtually all of his career\u2014Leone accepted the offer.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nLeone commissioned Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento to help him devise a [[film treatment]] in late 1966. The men spent much of the following year watching and discussing numerous classic Westerns, such as ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'', ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'', and ''[[The Searchers]]'' at Leone's house, and constructed a story made up almost entirely of \"references\" to American Westerns.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nBeginning with ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', which originally ran for three hours, Leone's films had usually been cut (often quite considerably) for box-office release. Leone was very conscious of the length of ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' during filming, and subsequently commissioned Sergio Donati, who had worked on several of Leone's other films, to help him refine the screenplay, largely to curb the length of the film toward the end of production. Many of the film's most memorable lines of dialogue came from Donati, or from the film's English dialogue adapter, expatriate American actor [[Mickey Knox]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kiral |first=Cenk |date=9 April 1998 |title=An Exclusive Interview With Mickey Knox |publisher=Fistful-of-leone.com |url=http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/articles/knox.html |access-date=12 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518034706/http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/articles/knox.html |archive-date=18 May 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Style and pacing===\n[[File:McBain ranch in Once upon a Time in the West.jpg|left|thumb|350px|The Sweetwater Ranch]]\nFor ''Once Upon a Time in the West'', Leone changed his approach over his earlier Westerns. Whereas the \"''Dollars''\" films were quirky and up-tempo, a celebratory yet tongue-in-cheek parody of the icons of the Wild West, this film is much slower in pace and somber in theme. Leone's distinctive style, which is very different from, but very much influenced by, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (1943), is still present, but has been modified for the beginning of Leone's second trilogy, the so-called ''Once Upon a Time'' trilogy. The characters in this film are also beginning to change markedly over their predecessors in the ''Dollars'' trilogy. They are not quite as defined, and unusual for Leone characters up to this point, they begin to change (or at least attempt to) over the course of the story. This signals the start of the second phase of Leone's style, which was further developed in ''Duck, You Sucker!'' and ''Once Upon a Time in America''.\n\nThe film features long, slow scenes with very little dialogue and little happening, broken by brief and sudden violence. Leone was far more interested in the rituals preceding violence than in the violence itself. The tone of the film is consistent with the arid semidesert in which the story unfolds, and imbues it with a feeling of realism that contrasts with the elaborately choreographed gunplay.\n\nLeone liked to tell the story of a cinema in Paris where the film ran uninterrupted for two years. When he visited this theater, he was surrounded by fans who wanted his autograph, as well as the projectionist, who was less than enthusiastic. Leone claimed the projectionist told him, \"I kill you! The same movie over and over again for two years! And it's so SLOW!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Frayling |first=Christopher |date=2012 |title=Sergio Leone: Something to do with Death |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |page=296 |isbn=9780816646838}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\n[[File:Monument Valley29.JPG|thumb|right|Monument Valley, Utah]]\nInteriors for the film were shot in [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios, [[Rome]].<ref name=\"The Wages of Sin 2003\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388530/ The Wages of Sin (2003)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211051556/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388530/ |date=11 February 2017 }}, part two of the making of Sergio Leone's ''Once Upon a Time in the West''</ref>\nThe opening sequence with the three gunmen meeting the train was one of the sequences filmed in [[Spain]].

The camera tilts up to the gunman's face and\u2026 it's Henry Fonda.\" After meeting with Leone, Fonda called his friend [[Eli Wallach]], who had co-starred in ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''. Wallach advised Fonda to do the film, telling him \"You will have the time of your life.\"\n\nWhen he accepted the role, Fonda came to the set with brown [[contact lenses]] and facial hair. Fonda felt having dark eyes and facial hair would blend well with his character's evil, and also help the audience to accept this \"new\" Fonda as the bad guy, but Leone immediately told him to remove the contacts and facial hair. Leone felt that Fonda's blue eyes best reflected the cold, icy nature of the killer. It was one of the first times in a [[Western (genre)|Western]] film where the villain was played by the lead actor.\n\nFollowing the film's completion, ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' was dubbed into several languages, including Italian, French, German, Spanish, and English. For the English dub, the voices of many of the American cast, including Fonda, Bronson, Robards, Wynn, Wolff, and [[Lionel Stander]], were used.  However, the rest of the cast had to be dubbed by other actors \u2013 including Claudia Cardinale, who was dubbed by actress [[Joyce Gordon]], Gabriele Ferzetti, who was voiced by Gordon's husband, [[Bernard Grant]], and [[Jack Elam]].<ref name= \"Howard\">Howard Hughes (2007).

As in ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', the haunting music contributes to the film's grandeur, and like the music for ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,'' is considered one of Morricone's greatest compositions.\n\nThe film features [[leitmotif]]s that relate to each of the main characters (with their own theme music), as well as to the spirit of the American West.<ref name=kehr/> Especially compelling are the wordless vocals by Italian singer [[Edda Dell'Orso]] during the theme music for Jill McBain.  Leone's desire was to have the music available and played during filming. Leone had Morricone compose the score before shooting started, and played the music in the background for the actors on set.<ref name=kehr/>\n\nExcept for about a minute of the \"Judgment\" motif, before Harmonica kills the three outlaws, no soundtrack music is played until the end of the second scene, when Fonda makes his first entry.  During the beginning of the film, Leone instead uses a number of ''natural sounds'', for instance, a turning wheel in the wind, sound of a train, grasshoppers, shotguns while hunting, wings of pigeons, etc., in addition to the [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|diegetic]] sound of the harmonica.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===European release===\nThe movie was a massive hit in France,<ref name=\"france\"/> and was easily the most successful film released there in 1969, with 14.8 million admissions, ranking [[List of highest-grossing films in France|seventh of all time]].<ref>[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&prev=search&rurl=translate.google.com.au&sl=fr&u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1969-c22750509&usg=ALkJrhh-fVvFyFVxoHyr2Bs-Vl9fugmACA Box office information for 1969 in France] at Box Office Story</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/top100.php?view=2 |title=Top250 Tous Les Temps En France (reprises incluses) |access-date=15 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331112258/http://www.jpbox-office.com/top100.php?view=2|archive-date=31 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\nIt sparked a brief fashion trend for [[duster (clothing)|duster]] coats, which took such proportions that Parisian [[department store]]s such as [[Printemps|Au Printemps]] had to affix signs on [[escalator]]s warning patrons to keep their \"maxis\", as they were called, clear from the edges of moving steps to prevent jamming.\n\nIt was also the most popular film in Germany with admissions of 13 million, ranking [[List of highest-grossing films in Germany|third of all time]].<ref name=\"GermanAdm\"/>\n\n===American release===\nIn the US, Paramount edited the film to about 145 minutes for the wide release, but the film underperformed at the box office, earning $2.1M in rentals in North America.<ref>\"Big Rental Films of 1969\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1970, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThese scenes were cut for the American release:\n* The entire scene at Lionel Stander's trading post. Cheyenne (Robards) was not introduced in the American release until his arrival at the McBain ranch later in the film. Stander remained in the credits, though he did not appear in this version at all.\n* The scene in which Morton and Frank discuss what to do with Jill at the Navajo Cliffs\n* Morton's death scene was reduced considerably.\n* Cheyenne's death scene was completely excised.\n\nOtherwise, one scene was slightly longer in the US version than in the international film release:<br />\nFollowing the opening duel (where all four gunmen fire and fall), Charles Bronson's character stands up again, showing that he had only been shot in the arm. This part of the scene had been originally cut by director Sergio Leone for the worldwide theatrical release. It was added again for the U.S. market, because the American distributors feared American viewers would not understand the story otherwise, especially since Harmonica's arm wound is originally shown for the first time in the scene at the trading post, which was cut for the shorter U.S. version.\n\nThe English-language version was restored to around 165 minutes for a re-release in 1984, and for its video release the following year.\n\n===Director's cut===\nIn Italy, a 175-minute director's cut features a yellow tint filter, and several scenes were augmented with additional material.

He found the film \"good fun\" and \"a painstaking distillation\" of Leone's famous style, with intriguing performances by actors cast against their type and a richness of detail projecting \"a sense of life of the West\" made possible by Paramount's larger budget for this Leone film. Ebert complained, however, of the film's length and convoluted plot, which he said only becomes clear by the second hour. While viewing Cardinale as a good casting choice, he said she lacked the \"blood-and-thunder abandon\" of her performance in ''[[Cartouche (film)|Cartouche]]'' (1962), blaming Leone for directing her \"too passively.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=6 June 1969 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-1969 |title=Once Upon a Time in the West (1969) |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=1 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902012129/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west-1969|archive-date=2 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years, the film developed a greater standing among critics, as well as a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mathijs |first1=Ernest |last2=Sexton |first2=Jamie |title=Cult Cinema: An Introduction |chapter=Cult Pastiche |year=2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-1444396430}}</ref> Directors such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[George Lucas]], [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref name=\"Snider\"/> and [[Vince Gilligan]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Breaking Bad Series Creator Vince Gilligan Answers Viewer Questions |url=http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad/talk/2011/10/vince-gilligan-interview |website=AMC.com |access-date=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317143300/http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad/talk/2011/10/vince-gilligan-interview|archive-date=17 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> have cited the film as an influence on their work.

According to film critic and historian [[Christopher Frayling]], the film quotes from as many as 30 classic American Westerns.\n\nThe major films referenced include:\n* ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'' (1961): The names \"McBain\" and \"Sweetwater\" may come from this film. Contrary to popular belief, the name of the town \"Sweetwater\" was not taken from [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]]'s silent epic drama ''[[The Wind (1928 film)|The Wind]]''. Bernardo Bertolucci has stated that he looked at a map of the Southwestern United States, found the name of the town in [[Arizona]], and decided to incorporate it into the film. However, both \"Sweetwater\" and a character named \"McBain\" appeared in ''The Comancheros'', which Leone admired.<ref name=\"Frayling\"/>\n* ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954): Jill and Vienna have similar backstories (both are former prostitutes who become saloonkeepers), and both own land where a train station will be built because of access to water. Also, Harmonica, like [[Sterling Hayden]]'s title character, is a mysterious, gunslinging outsider known by his musical nickname. Some of ''West'''s central plot (Western settlers vs. the railroad company) may be recycled from [[Nicholas Ray]]'s film.<ref name=\"Frayling\">Frayling{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924): ''West'' may contain several subtle references to this film, including a low-angle shot of a shrieking train rushing towards the screen in the opening scene, and the shot of the train pulling into the Sweetwater station at the end.<ref name=\"Frayling\"/>\n* ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953): The massacre scene in ''West'' features young Timmy McBain out hunting with his father, just as Joey does in this movie. The funeral of the McBains is borrowed almost shot-for-shot from ''Shane''.<ref name=\"Frayling\"/>\n* ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956): Leone admitted that the rustling bushes, the silencing of insect sounds, and the fluttering grouse that suggests menace is approaching the farmhouse when the McBain family is massacred were all taken from ''The Searchers''. The ending of the film\u2014where Western nomads Harmonica and Cheyenne move on rather than join modern society\u2014also echoes the famous ending of Ford's film.<ref name=\"Frayling\"/>\n* ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950): The scenes in ''West'' at the trading post are claimed to be based on those in ''Winchester '73'', but the resemblance is slight.<ref name=\"Frayling\"/>\n* ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962): The [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] (long coats) worn by Cheyenne and his gang (and by Frank and his men while impersonating them) resemble those worn by Liberty Valance ([[Lee Marvin]]) and his henchmen when they are introduced in this film.
