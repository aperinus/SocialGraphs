The original script for the film had the same plotline but would have addressed American policy in the Middle East by taking place in [[Libya]]; director Davis and his screenwriters chose Colombia as the new location because it had not been used as extensively and touched on a current geopolitical conflict area.\n\n==Plot==\nA bomb detonates in the plaza of the [[Colombia]]n Consulate building in [[Los Angeles]], killing nine people, including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of an [[Los Angeles City Fire Department|LAFD]] firefighter, Captain Gordon \"Gordy\" Brewer, who was injured in the explosion. A tape is sent to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], in which a masked man calling himself ''\"El Lobo\"'' (''The Wolf'') claims responsibility, justifying it as retaliation for the oppression of Colombia by the United States. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] believes ''El Lobo'' is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Special Agent Peter Brandt, the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Oversight Committee]], which promptly terminates all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to [[Santa Cruz de Mompox|Momp\u00f3s]] and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio.\n\nFrustrated at the political [[red tape]] regarding the investigation, Brewer travels to Momp\u00f3s to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegal entry. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their comrades and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late. Brewer escapes the prison, evades capture, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong. Armstrong introduces him to drug runner Felix Ramirez, the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Masquerading as a \"mechanic\", Brewer rigs several [[improvised explosive device|improvised explosives]] and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Brewer's eyes. Brewer infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but he is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, Selena, from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals she is Claudio's wife. She and Claudio once lost their own child during an American attack, which compelled Claudio to become a terrorist; Selena found and adopted Mauro, whose parents were killed in the attack. Regardless, Selena eventually sympathizes with Brewer and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] as the target, and the FBI investigates. On the pretense of using the lavatory, Selena excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when Mauro refuses to come with her. When Brewer sees Selena make the same gesture as the masked man who claimed to be El Lobo in the tape, he realizes that ''she'' was the Wolf all along, and Claudio serves as her figurehead, and that the entire motive behind their cause is personal revenge for the death of their daughter at the hands of the US. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the ''real'' target is the State Department, and that he was used to help Selena get past the building's security. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's bomb-laden toy dinosaur out a window seconds before it explodes. Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot and killed trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.\n\nBrewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape. Brewer uses an axe to rupture some gas lines along the walls of the tunnel and, as they ride back, Selena shoots at Brewer, unwittingly igniting the gas. Brewer jumps through a doorway just as the entire tunnel explodes. Selena and Claudio survive the blast, however, and attack him simultaneously. After a short, hand-to-hand fight, Selena is electrocuted by being tossed on the exposed circuitry of the control panel, and Claudio is himself killed when Brewer throws an axe into his chest before he can detonate a second bomb in the State Department.\n\nIn the aftermath, Brewer carries Mauro in his arms as they leave the State Department. A newscast voiceover explains that Brewer will receive the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for preventing one of the worst terrorist attacks in U.S. history from taking place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Captain Gordon \"Gordy\" Brewer, A Los Angeles firefighter who seeks Colombian terrorists responsible for the killing of his wife and son.\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Peter Brandt, the head of the CIA station of Colombia.\n* [[Francesca Neri]] as Selena Perrini, the wife of Claudio. \n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Claudio \"El Lobo\" Perrini, a Colombian terrorist known as the Wolf.\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Felix Ramirez, the manager of cocaine distribution facility.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Sean Armstrong, a Canadian mechanic.\n* [[Lindsay Frost]] as Anne Brewer, Gordy's wife.\n* Ethan Dampf as Matt Brewer, Gordy's son.\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as FBI Special Agent Joe Phipps, the FBI agent in charge.\n* [[Harry Lennix]] as FBI Agent Dray, Phipps's FBI partner\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Agent Russo\n* [[Tyler Posey]] as Mauro, the adopted son of Selena and Claudio.\n* Fernando Sarfati as Federale\n* [[Jsu Garcia]] as Roman, Claudio's right-hand man.\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Jack, Gordy's fellow fireman.\n* [[Rick Worthy]] as Ronnie, Gordy's fellow fireman.\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Junior, Gordy's fellow fireman.\n* [[J.
