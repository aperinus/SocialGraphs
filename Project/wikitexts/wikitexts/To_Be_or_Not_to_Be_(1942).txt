The plot concerns a troupe of actors in [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied Warsaw who use their abilities at disguise and acting to fool the occupying troops. It was adapted by Lubitsch (uncredited) and [[Edwin Justus Mayer]] from the story by [[Melchior Lengyel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b779dd367 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711201807/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b779dd367 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=To Be or Not to Be &#124; BFI &#124; BFI |publisher=Explore.bfi.org.uk |access-date=2014-04-08}}</ref> The film was released one month after actress Carole Lombard was killed in an airplane crash.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93439/to-be-or-not-to-be#notes|title=To Be or Not to Be (1942) - Notes |publisher=TCM.com |access-date=2022-10-05}}</ref> In 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php|title=National Film Registry (National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress)|date=2013-11-20|publisher=Loc.gov|access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>\n\nThe title is a reference to the famous \"[[To be, or not to be]]\" soliloquy in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref>[[To be, or not to be]]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe well-known stars of a theater company in Warsaw, including \"[[wikt:ham#Etymology 3|ham]]\" actor Josef Tura and wife Maria, are rehearsing ''[[Gestapo]]'', a satirical Nazi play. That night, when the company is performing ''[[Hamlet]]'', with Tura in the title role, one of the actors, Bronski, commiserates with colleague Greenberg about being limited to being [[spear carrier]]s. Greenberg, who is implied to be Jewish, reveals he always has dreamed of playing [[Shylock]] in [[The Merchant of Venice|''The'' ''Merchant of Venice'']].\n\nMaria receives an admiring letter from Lieutenant Stanislav Sobinski and she invites him to visit her in her dressing room that night when Tura begins his \"To be or not to be...\" speech. Soon, the government issues orders to cancel ''Gestapo'' in order to avoid possibly worsening relations with Germany. The following night, Sobinski again walks out during \"To be or not to be\" to meet Maria, infuriating Tura. Sobinski confesses his love to Maria, assuming that she will leave her husband, as well as the stage, to be with him. Before Maria can correct Sobinski's assumption, news breaks out that [[Invasion of Poland|Germany has invaded Poland]]. Sobinski leaves to join the fight at the Polish division of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and the actors hide as Warsaw is bombed.\n\nSobinski and his fellows meets the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] leader Professor Siletsky. Siletsky will return to Warsaw soon, and the men give him messages for their loved ones. However, Sobinski becomes suspicious when Siletsky doesn't know of Maria Tura. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] realize that Siletsky has the identity of the relatives of Polish airmen in the RAF, against whom reprisals can be taken should he give the information to the Nazis. Sobinski flies back to warn Maria, however Siletsky has Maria brought to him by German soldiers and passes on Sobinski's message to her. He invites Maria to dinner, hoping to recruit her as a Nazi spy. Just before she arrives home, Tura returns and finds Sobinski in his bed. Maria and Sobinski try to figure out what to do about Siletsky, while Tura tries to figure out what is going on with his wife and the pilot. Tura proclaims that he will kill Siletsky.\n\nLater, a member of the company disguised as Gestapo summons Siletsky to \"Gestapo headquarters\", the theatre. Tura pretends to be Colonel Ehrhardt of the Gestapo. Siletsky reveals Sobinski's message for Maria, and that \"To be or not to be\" signals their rendezvous. A surprised Tura uncontrollably reveals himself. Siletsky tries to escape but is shot and killed by Sobinski. Tura disguises himself as Siletsky, destroying his extra copy of the information and confronting Maria about her relationship with Sobinski. He meets Ehrhardt's adjutant, Captain Schultz, and is taken to meet him. Tura successfully passes himself off, and names recently executed prisoners as the leaders of the resistance. Later, Maria meets with Ehrhardt, who informs her that they have found Siletsky's corpse in the theatre. Tura, unaware of this, telephones Ehrhardt still masquerading as Siletsky. Ehrhardt decides to expose him as an impostor by showing him into a room where he finds Siletsky's body. Tura, who has an extra fake beard, shaves off Siletsky's beard and applies the fake beard, and then goads Ehrhardt into pulling it off, convincing him that Tura is the real Siletsky. Unaware of Tura's successful scheme, several of the actors disguised as Gestapo arrive at Maria's request, yank off Tura's fake beard, and pretend to drag him out. Everyone is safe, but cannot leave Poland as planned on the plane Ehrhardt had arranged for Siletsky.\n\nThe Germans stage a show to honor Hitler during his visit. The actors slip into the theater dressed as Germans and hide until Hitler and his entourage arrive and take their seats. As the Germans are singing the ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'', Greenberg suddenly appears and rushes Hitler's box, causing enough distraction to exchange the actors for the real Germans. Acting as the head of Hitler's guard, Tura demands to know what Greenberg wants, giving the actor his chance to deliver Shylock's speech, ending with \"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?!\" Tura orders Greenberg to be \"taken away\"; all the actors march out, get in Hitler's cars and drive away.\n\nAt her apartment, Maria waits for the company, as they all intend to leave, but Ehrhardt arrives. Bronski enters costumed as Hitler, then walks out speechless, shocked at seeing Ehrhardt trying to seduce Maria\u2014which makes Erhardt believe she is Hitler's mistress. Maria flees, and Ehrhardt shoots himself out of shame.\n\nThe actors take off on Hitler's plane. Sobinski flies to Scotland, where the actors are interviewed by the press. Asked what reward Tura would like for saving the underground movement, Maria asserts that Josef wants to play Hamlet. While performing, Tura is gratified to see Sobinski sitting quietly in the audience at the critical moment of his soliloquy. But as he proceeds, the audience is distracted as a handsome young officer gets up and heads noisily backstage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carole Lombard]] as Maria Tura, an actress in Nazi-occupied Poland\n* [[Jack Benny]] as Joseph Tura, an actor and Maria's husband\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Lt.

He had even written the character with Benny in mind. Benny, thrilled that a director of Lubitsch's caliber had been thinking of him while writing it, accepted the role immediately. Benny was in a predicament as, strangely enough, his success in the film version of ''[[Charley's Aunt (1941 film)|Charley's Aunt]]'' (1941) did not interest anyone in hiring the actor for their films.\n\nFor Benny's costar, the studio and Lubitsch decided on [[Miriam Hopkins]], whose career had been faltering in recent years. The role was designed as a comeback for the veteran actress, but Hopkins and Benny did not get along well, and Hopkins left the production.\n\nLubitsch was left without a leading lady until [[Carole Lombard]], hearing his predicament, asked to be considered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/27516-TO-BEORNOTTOBE|title=To Be or Not to Be|publisher=Afi.com |access-date=2022-10-05}}</ref> Lombard had never worked with the director and yearned to have an opportunity. Lubitsch agreed and Lombard was cast. The film also provided Lombard with an opportunity to work with friend [[Robert Stack]], whom she had known since he was a teenager. The film was shot at [[United Artists]], which allowed Lombard to say that she had worked at every major studio in Hollywood.\n\n==Reception==\n''To Be or Not To Be,'' now regarded as one of the great films of Lubitsch's, Benny's and Lombard's careers, initially was not well received by the public, many of whom could not understand the notion of making fun out of such a real threat as the Nazis. According to Jack Benny's unfinished memoir, published in 1991, his own father walked out of the theater early in the film, disgusted that his son was in a Nazi uniform, and vowed not to set foot in the theater again. Benny convinced him otherwise, and his father ended up loving the film, and saw it 46 times.<ref>Jack Benny and Joan Benny, ''Sunday Nights at Seven: The Jack Benny Story'', G.K. Hall, 1991, p. 232</ref>\n\nThe same could not be said for all critics. While they generally praised Lombard, some scorned Benny and Lubitsch and found the film to be in bad taste. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that it was \"hard to imagine how any one can take, without batting an eye, a shattering air raid upon Warsaw right after a sequence of farce or the spectacle of Mr. Benny playing a comedy scene with a Gestapo corpse. Mr. Lubitsch had an odd sense of humor\u2014and a tangled script\u2014when he made this film.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9500E7DE143CE33BBC4F53DFB5668389659EDE |title=Movie Review - To Be or Not to Be |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=March 7, 1942 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 6, 2016 }}</ref> ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' agreed, calling the film \"a callous, tasteless effort to find fun in the bombing of Warsaw.\"<ref name=\"insdorf\">{{cite book |last=Insdorf |first=Annette |date=2003 |title=Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust |edition=Third |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=67 |isbn=9780521016308 }}</ref> Some critics were especially offended by Colonel Ehrhardt's line: \"Oh, yes I saw him [Tura] in 'Hamlet' once.

Lubitsch responded by publishing an open letter to the newspaper in which he wrote, <blockquote>What I have satirized in this picture are the Nazis and their ridiculous ideology. I have also satirized the attitude of actors who always remain actors regardless of how dangerous the situation might be, which I believe is a true observation. It can be argued if the tragedy of Poland realistically portrayed as in ''To Be or Not to Be'' can be merged with satire. I believe it can be and so do the audience which I observed during a screening of ''To Be or Not to Be''; but this is a matter of debate and everyone is entitled to his point of view, but it is certainly a far cry from the Berlin-born director who finds fun in the bombing of Warsaw.<ref name=\"insdorf\" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Weinberg |first=Herman |date=1977 |title=The Lubitsch Touch: A Critical Study |publisher=Dover Publications |page=246 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn recent times the film has become recognized as a comedy classic.
