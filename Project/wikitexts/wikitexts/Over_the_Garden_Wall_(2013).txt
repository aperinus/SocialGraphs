The series centers on two half-brothers who travel across a mysterious forest to find their way home, encountering a variety of strange and fantastical things on their journey. The show is based on McHale's animated short film ''[[Tome of the Unknown]]'', which was produced as part of [[Cartoon Network Studios]]' shorts development program. [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Collin Dean]] voice the protagonists Wirt and Greg, and [[Melanie Lynskey]] voices Beatrice, a [[Eastern bluebird|bluebird]]. The series' voice cast also includes [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Thomas Lennon]],  [[Jack Jones (American singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Jerron \"Blind Boy\" Paxton|Jerron Paxton]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Samuel Ramey]]. [[The Blasting Company]] composed the soundtrack. ''Over the Garden Wall'' was broadcast throughout the week of November 3 to November 7, 2014.\n\nThe show was the first miniseries on the network. McHale first envisioned it in 2004 and pitched it to the network in 2006. After working on other Cartoon Network shows including ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'', the network expressed interest in McHale pitching a pilot. That pilot, ''Tome of the Unknown'', became the catalyst for ''Over the Garden Wall''. Production of the show began in March 2014 and was largely done in [[Burbank, California]], but many of the show's storyboard artists worked from other U.S. cities, while the program's animation was outsourced to South Korean studio [[Digital eMation]].{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=45, 78}} The series' environment evokes 19th- and 20th-century [[Americana (culture)|Americana]], while its digital backgrounds are designed to resemble [[grisaille]] paintings.\n\nThe series was well-received by television critics, who praised its atmosphere and characters. In 2015, the series won an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program]]. A [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book adaptation penned by McHale has been produced, with four further issues commissioned. This was later expanded into an ongoing comic series that ran for 20 issues and continued in a series of [[graphic novel]]s and comic book miniseries.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series follows two half-brothers, [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Wirt|Wirt]] and [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Gregory (Greg)|Greg]] (voiced by [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Collin Dean]] respectively), who become lost in a strange forest called the Unknown. To find their way home, the two must travel across the seemingly supernatural forest with the occasional help of the wandering, mysterious and elderly [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Woodsman|Woodsman]] ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) and [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Beatrice|Beatrice]] ([[Melanie Lynskey]]), an irritable [[Eastern bluebird|bluebird]] who travels with the boys to find a woman called [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Adelaide|Adelaide]], who can supposedly undo the curse on Beatrice and her family and show the half-brothers the way home.<ref name=\"Hersh 2014a\" />\n\nWirt, the older brother, is a worry-prone teenager who would rather keep to himself than have to make a decision. His passions including playing the [[clarinet]] and writing poetry,<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Tracy|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-exclusive-clip-for-sara-over-the-garden-wall-20150915-story.html|title=Listen to Elijah Wood's poetry-filled mixtape from Emmy-winning 'Over the Garden Wall'|date=September 15, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref> but he usually keeps these private out of fear of being mocked. On the other hand, Greg, the younger brother, is more na\u00efve and carefree, much to Wirt's chagrin. Greg carries a frog ([[Jack Jones (American singer)|Jack Jones]]) that he found; Greg's attempts to give the frog a name are a [[running gag]]. Stalking the main cast is [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Beast|the Beast]] ([[Samuel Ramey]]), an ancient creature who leads lost souls astray until they lose their hope and willpower and turn into \"Edelwood trees\".<ref name=odyssey>{{cite web|last=Healy|first=Jack Patrick|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/symbolism-death-over-garden-wall|title=Symbolism Of Death In 'Over The Garden Wall'|date=August 2, 2016|work=[[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]]|access-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Once they find Adelaide, Wirt discovers that she intends only to enslave the boys; outraged that Beatrice misled them, Wirt takes Greg and abandons her.\n\n===Final chapters===\nThe penultimate episode reveals that Wirt and Greg are modern children who entered the Unknown after falling into a pond on [[Halloween]]. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry and clarinet tape he made for a girl he is infatuated with, had followed her to a [[ghost story]] party in a graveyard, where a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on a train track. To save Greg from being hit by a train, Wirt pulled him into a nearby pond, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a [[Limbo]]-like<ref name=odyssey /> realm between life and death.\n\nIn the final episode, Wirt saves Greg from being turned into an Edelwood tree by the Beast. At the end of the episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital back in their hometown. As the scene ends, Greg's frog, which swallowed a magic bell in the Unknown, begins to glow, suggesting that their experience in the Unknown may have been real. The series ends with a montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.<ref name=\"Hersh 2014b\" />\n\n==Production==\n''Over the Garden Wall'' was first envisioned in 2004 with a scarier and more adventure-based storyline. Before working as a storyboard artist on ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'', artist [[Patrick McHale (artist)|Patrick McHale]] pitched the show in 2006, then known under the title ''Tome of the Unknown''. The series would follow two brothers\u2014Walter and Gregory\u2014who, after signing themselves into a [[Faust]]ian deal with a devil named Old Scratch, journey across the Land of the In-Between to track down the pages of a book of forgotten stories.{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=13}}\n\nMcHale saw it as \"a possible Halloween special\", but had trouble adapting the premise with a larger [[story arc]].<ref name=\"Day 2014\" /> After his work for ''Flapjack'', McHale moved on to co-develop ''[[Adventure Time]]'', where he served as creative director, and subsequently as a writer. The network later asked him if he had interest in developing a pilot, which led to him returning to ''Tome of the Unknown'', polishing it and pitching it again to the network.<ref name=\"McLean 2014a\" />{{rp|29}} After creating a pilot episode, ''[[Tome of the Unknown: Harvest Melody]]'', McHale and the network settled upon the miniseries format for the ensuing series, as McHale felt that it would lead to \"something that felt higher quality than what we could do with a regular series\".<ref name=\"Day 2014\" /> McHale abandoned the original idea centered around chapters of a mystical tome and the series' title became ''Over the Garden Wall''.{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=67}}\n\nProduction for ''Over the Garden Wall'' commenced in late 2013. McHale initially envisioned eighteen chapters in the series, but the episode count was brought to ten to accommodate budget and time constraints. Early drafts of episodes from the show's [[Bible (screenwriting)|pitch bible]] included a skinless witch character and a villain who carves dice from the bones of kidnapped children, as well a running plot throughout four episodes in which Wirt and Gregory are transformed into animals (Gregory being a duck and Wirt being \"either a bear or a dog ... Nobody can tell which\").{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=15, 67}}\n\nThe ten episodes marked the first [[miniseries]] on the Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"Andreeva 2014\" /> The show features Wood and Dean (reprising their roles from the short), along with Lynskey as the main voice cast. McHale and his crew tried to maintain a balance between frightening imagery and \"episodes that are just light and funny\".<ref name=\"Walsh-Boyle 2014\" />{{rp|24}} For the music, McHale drew inspiration from \"classic American, opera singing\".<ref name=\"Day 2014\" /> [[Nick Cross (animator)|Nick Cross]] served as art director and [[Nate Cash]] as supervising director; both worked with McHale alongside storyboard artists located in New York and Chicago. This distance proved difficult for McHale, who found it \"particularly daunting considering the idiosyncratic nature of the production\".<ref name=\"Day 2014\" /> \n\nThe series' art was inspired by a variety of sources, including the 1890s [[McLoughlin Brothers]] board game ''Game of Frog Pond'',{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=24}} illustrations by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] for [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'',{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=46}} old illustrations for the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] story \"[[The Tinderbox]]\",{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=86}} the [[Cheshire Cat]] illustration by [[John Tenniel]] from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'',{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=87}} and the \"[[Dogville Comedies]]\" short films.{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=102}} McHale referenced [[chromolithography]], vintage Halloween postcards, [[magic lantern]] slides, and photographs of [[New England]] foliage to create the show's style.{{sfn|Edgar|McHale|2017|p=7}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{stack|[[File:Wirt_and_Greg,_the_main_characters_from_the_miniseries_Over_the_Garden_Wall.jpg|thumb|225px|Greg (''left'') and Wirt, two half-brothers who act as the miniseries' main protagonists, along with Beatrice the bluebird and Greg's pet frog.]]|float=right}}\n{{Main|List of Over the Garden Wall characters}}\n\n===Main voices===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Wirt|Wirt]]\n* [[Collin Dean]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Gregory|Gregory]] (Greg)\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Beatrice|Beatrice]]\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Woodsman|the Woodsman]]\n* [[Jack Jones (American singer)|Jack Jones]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Frog|Greg's Frog]]\n* [[Samuel Ramey]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Beast|the Beast]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Various voices===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Emily Brundige as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Sara|Sara]]\n* Mark Bodnar as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Cloud City residents|the North Wind]]\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Quincy Endicott|Quincy Endicott]] and [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Adelaide|Adelaide]]\n* [[Tim Curry]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Auntie Whispers|Auntie Whispers]]\n* [[Noureen DeWulf]] as Pumpkin Gal\n* Frank Fairfield as the Toy Maker\n* [[Chris Isaak]] as Enoch\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Beatrice's Mother\n* Janet Klein as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Miss Langtree|Miss Langtree]]\n* [[Thomas Lennon]] as Jimmy Brown\n* Sam Marin as Mr. Langtree\n* Judah Nelson as the [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Cloud City residents|Cloud City Reception Committee]]\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Margueritte Grey\n* [[Jerron \"Blind Boy\" Paxton]] as the Highwayman\n* [[Cole Sanchez]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Jason Funderberker|Jason Funderberker]]\n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Lorna|Lorna]]\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Fred the Horse\n* [[Deborah Voigt]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#Cloud City residents|Queen of the Clouds]]\n* [[Audrey Wasilewski]] as the Tavern Keeper\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n=== Series overview ===\n{{Series overview\n\n| color0S    = #979797\n| link0S     = #Pilot (2013)\n| linkT0S    = Pilot\n| start0S    = {{Start date|2013|9|9}}\n\n| color1     = #804060\n| link1      = #Miniseriies (2014)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2014|11|3}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2014|11|7}}\n\n}}\n\n===Pilot (2013)===\n{{Episode table |background=#979797 |title= |aux1= |aux1T=Written, Storyboarded and Directed by |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| Title=[[Tome of the Unknown|Tome of the Unknown: Harvest Melody]]\n| WrittenBy=[[Patrick McHale (artist)|Patrick McHale]]\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2013|9|9}} <small>([[LA Shorts Fest]])</small><br />{{Start date|2015|5|18}} <small>(Online)</small> \n| ShortSummary=Wirt and Gregory grow tired of walking, so they borrow a car made of vegetables from a romantic songwriter named John Crops.

He fashions a costume out of an old Santa Claus hat and a marching band cloak. Greg gives the tape to Sara's friends, who tell Wirt that he should hurry, because another boy, Jason Funderberker, was planning on asking her out at a party that night. Trying to retrieve the tape, they end up at the party. Wirt meets up with Sara, who invites him to go to the graveyard with her and her friends. He declines and tries to get the tape from her jacket. However, Sara comes back for it, leading Wirt and Greg to sneak after her and her friends. \n\nAt the graveyard, the group is telling ghost stories when Greg tries to cause a distraction for Wirt. A police car pulls up and jokingly tells them off for being in the graveyard, but they take him seriously and run off, with Wirt and Greg scaling a wall at the edge of the graveyard. At the top, Wirt notices Sara finding the tape in her jacket and he panics. They jump off the wall and onto a set of train tracks on the other side. Wirt blames Greg and his stepfather for ruining his life, but Greg pays no attention and picks up a frog in the bushes. A train comes down the tracks, heading straight for them. Wirt and Greg jump out of the way, but roll down a steep hill and into a lake, knocking them both unconscious. Wirt then wakes up after the events of the previous episode, and finds himself in a nest with Beatrice's family. He thanks them and heads off with Greg's frog into a [[snowstorm]] to look for his brother.\n| LineColor=804060\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=10\n| Title=[[The Unknown (Over the Garden Wall)|The Unknown]]\n| WrittenBy=Natasha Allegri, Jim Campbell, and Tom Herpich\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|11|7}} \n| Viewers=1.13<ref name=\"Ratings for Episodes 9 and 10\" />\n| ShortSummary=After leaving Wirt with her family, Beatrice navigates through the storm to find Greg, who she sees performing meaningless tasks for the Beast. She is whisked away by the strong wind and crashes into Wirt, who was wandering in the storm holding Greg's frog, and leads him to where she last saw Greg. As the sun sets, having used up what little Edelwood he had left, the Woodsman ventures into the woods and finds Greg transforming into a new Edelwood tree. The Woodsman attempts to free Greg before fighting the Beast away from the clearing as Wirt and Beatrice arrive. He asks Wirt to return his \"rock fact\" rock that he stole from Mrs. Daniel's garden for him once he is gone, to which Wirt refuses, and decides to name Greg's frog \"Jason Funderburker\" to cheer him up as he tries to break the Edelwood branches off. Wirt then sees the Woodsman knocked down at his feet as the Beast appears, offering to keep Greg's soul alive inside the lantern in exchange for Wirt taking over the Woodsman's duties in keeping it lit. Wirt is tempted to accept this offer, but he realizes that the flame within the lantern is actually the Beast's own source of life. \n\nAfter explaining this to everyone in the clearing, Wirt frees Greg and asks Beatrice to come with them. She declines, wanting to return home and admit to her family she is responsible for their curse. Wirt gives Beatrice Adelaide's magic scissors, sheepishly admitting he kept them from her out of spite. They head off as the Woodsman, mortified to learn that Edelwood trees grew from the bodies of the lost and that he had never been keeping his daughter alive, resists the Beast's lies and extinguishes the lantern, ending the Beast's life. After Wirt and Beatrice say their goodbyes, Wirt wakes up under the pond and pulls Greg and his frog to the surface, passing out as the police and his friends show up. The brothers are taken by ambulance to the hospital. Wirt wakes up next to Greg, Sara, and her friends. Sara tells Wirt that she had not listened to the tape yet, as she does not own a [[Cassette deck|cassette player]]. Wirt offers for her to listen to it at his house, which she accepts. Greg starts telling everyone about the events they had experienced, and his frog's stomach glows with the magic bell still inside. Back in the Unknown, the Woodsman is sitting on his porch in melancholy when his daughter comes out of his home, having come back to life along with the other lost souls. The other Unknown residents are shown to be living happier lives as a result of Wirt and Greg's influence, including Beatrice and her family, who have been restored to human form. Greg's frog plays the piano and sings, and Greg returns the stolen rock back to Mrs. Daniel's garden. \n| LineColor=804060\n}}\n}}\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Broadcast==\nMcHale's original short, ''Tome of the Unknown'', was screened at the 2014 [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], where McHale earned the Bruce Corwin Award for best animated short film.<ref name=\"Santa Barbara International Film Festival 2014\" /> It also received an honorable mention at the 2013 [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]].<ref name=\"Zahed 2013\" />\n\nAt the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] International, a preview of the show was screened along with various panels for other shows on the network.<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" /> Episode 2 was previewed at the 2014 [[New York Comic Con]], which McHale and the main cast attended.<ref name=\"Milligan 2014b\" /> The show made its premiere on November 3, 2014 on Cartoon Network, and ran over five consecutive nights.<ref name=\"Weinstein 2014\" /> The entirety of it was published on [[iTunes]] preceding its broadcast.<ref name=\"Davis 2014\" /> \n\nThe series aired on [[Cartoon Network (Australia and New Zealand)|Cartoon Network]] in Australia from December 15 to 19, 2014<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.turner.com/pressroom/get-lost-unknown-over-garden-wall|title=GET LOST IN THE UNKNOWN OVER THE GARDEN WALL|date=October 8, 2014|access-date=January 16, 2017|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=[[Sydney]]}}</ref> and on [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland from April 6 to 10, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network UK April 2015 Highlights|url=https://www.regularcapital.com/2015/02/cartoon-network-uk-april-2015-highlights/|website=RegularCapital: Cartoon Network International News|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System Europe (Press Release)}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Over the Garden Wall (Original Television Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      = \n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = September 19, 2017\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Jazz]],<ref name=\"on music\">{{cite news |last=Polo |first=Susana |date=November 3, 2014 |title=An Interview With the Folks Behind Cartoon Network's Over the Garden Wall, Premiering Tonight! |url=http://www.themarysue.com/an-interview-with-the-folks-behind-cartoon-networks-over-the-garden-wall-premiering-tonight/ |publisher=The Mary Sue |access-date=September 20, 2016 }}</ref> [[American folk music|folk]]\n| length     = 53:13\n| label      = Cartoon Network\n| producer   = The Blasting Company\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nVarious melodies and songs based on pre-1950s music are heard throughout the series.<ref name=\"on music\"/> [[Elijah Wood]], the voice actor for Wirt, has said that \"if this show were a record, it would be played on a [[phonograph]]\".<ref name=tvguide>{{cite web|last=Maas|first=Emily|date=October 21, 2014|title=Video: Creating the Soundtrack for Cartoon Network's Over the Garden Wall|website=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=April 24, 2016|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/creating-soundtrack-cartoon-1088224/}}</ref> Songs from the series include \"Into the Unknown\", its title song, composed by Patrick McHale and sung by [[Jack Jones (American singer)|Jack Jones]]; \"A Courting Song\", composed by the Petrojvic Blasting Company and performed by Frank Fairfield; and \"Come Wayward Souls\", sung by [[Samuel Ramey]] as [[List of Over the Garden Wall characters#The Beast|the Beast]].<ref name=tvguide />\n\nThe majority of the series' songs have been officially uploaded to [[YouTube]].

Produced by KaBoom!, an imprint of [[Boom! Studios]], the comic was released on November 5, 2014. The comic was supervised by McHale and was produced as an oversized special. The comic was illustrated by Jim Campbell, a writer/storyboard artist on the television series. A special variant cover, by McHale, was also released.<ref name=\"McLean 2014b\" /> The success of the standalone comic led to further issues being commissioned in May 2015 and began to be released in August 2015. According to McHale, the comic books would be similar to the one-shot comic, detailing the events that occurred in between certain episodes and would expand on the television miniseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/exclusive-pat-mchale-announces-over-the-garden-wall-comic-book-series/|title=Exclusive: Pat McHale announces 'Over the Garden Wall' comic book series|first=Tracy|last=Brown|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 13, 2015|access-date=January 5, 2016}}</ref> The success of the series of one-shots led to an ongoing series of comics, serving as both a sequel and prequel to the series, rather than telling adventures that happened between episodes. The stories are told parallel, with half the comic detailing Greg returning to mysterious dreamlands in his sleep. The other half chronicles the Woodsman's daughter, Anna, and how she became lost in the Unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/kaboom-over-the-garden-wall-ongoing/ |title=KaBoom Announces Ongoing 'Over the Garden Wall' Series |website=[[ComicsAlliance]] |first=Elle |last=Collins |date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623181820/http://comicsalliance.com/kaboom-over-the-garden-wall-ongoing/ |archive-date=June 23, 2016 }}</ref> After the ongoing series ended in November 2017, the ''Over the Garden Wall'' comics continued as a series of miniseries and original graphic novels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/over-the-garden-wall-returns-with-distillatoria-graphic-novel-this-november/|title=Over the Garden Wall returns with DISTILLATORIA graphic novel this November|date=February 22, 2018|work=The Beat|access-date=February 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"Hollow town announcement\">{{cite web |title=Boom!
