R. R. Tolkien]]. The film is the first installment in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Sean Astin]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Ian Holm]], and [[Andy Serkis]].\n\nSet in [[Middle-earth]], the story tells of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks the [[One Ring]], which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young [[hobbit]] [[Frodo Baggins]]. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]) begin their journey to [[Mount Doom]] in the land of [[Mordor]], the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was financed and distributed by American studio [[New Line Cinema]], but [[Production of The Lord of the Rings film series|filmed and edited]] entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, [[Back-to-back film production|concurrently]] with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\nIt premiered on 10 December 2001 at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in [[London]], and was then released on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880<!--AT THAT TIME!--> million worldwide in its initial release, making it the [[2001 in film#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of 2001]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|fifth<!-- This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, do NOT adjust! --> highest-grossing film of all time]] at the time of its release.<ref name=\"BOM 2002\">{{cite web |title=All Time Worldwide Box Office |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001123059/http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-date=1 October 2002}}</ref> Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $897&nbsp;million.<ref name=BOM2021/>\n\nLike its successors, ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' is widely recognized as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]].

Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\n<section begin=Plot/>In the Second Age of [[Middle-earth]], the lords of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], and [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] are given [[Rings of Power]]. Unbeknownst to them, the [[Sauron|Dark Lord Sauron]] forges the [[One Ring]] in [[Mount Doom]], instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in [[Mordor]]. [[Isildur]] of [[Gondor]] severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by [[Gollum]], who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a [[hobbit]] named [[Bilbo Baggins]], who is unaware of its history.\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], reuniting with his old friend, the wizard [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]], Gandalf rides to [[Isengard]] to meet with the wizard [[Saruman]], but discovers his alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead [[Nazg\u00fbl]] servants to find Frodo.\n\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and they evade the Nazg\u00fbl before arriving in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named [[Aragorn|Strider]], who promises to escort them to [[Rivendell]]; however, they are ambushed by the Nazg\u00fbl on [[Weathertop]], and their leader, the [[Witch-king of Angmar|Witch-King]], stabs Frodo with a [[Morgul blade]]. [[Arwen]], an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazg\u00fbl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.\n\nFacing the threat of both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, [[Elrond|Lord Elrond]], decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf [[Legolas]], Dwarf [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], [[Boromir]] of Gondor, and Strider\u2014who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of ''mithril''.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave [[troll]]. They hold them off but are confronted by [[Balrog#Durin's Bane|Durin's Bane]]: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], ruled by the Elf-queen [[Galadriel]], who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of his friends in the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of [[Uruk-hai]] in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to [[Parth Galen]]. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring as Lady Galadriel had predicted. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship; their leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as he fails to stop them from taking Merry and Pippin as prisoners. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. <section end=Plot/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further-text|[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)#Cast|Cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]}}\n[[File:Fellowship.JPG|thumb|right|350px|The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli]]\n\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]]), riding and boating.

Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the part as one of his ''Oliver Twist'' fellow actors opined that it wasn't a good idea if his face wasn't going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture performance as they wished.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/l_U0S6x_kCs Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20200601001920/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_U0S6x_kCs&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_U0S6x_kCs|title=One Zoom to Rule Them All <nowiki>|</nowiki> Reunited Apart LORD OF THE RINGS Edition|last=[[Josh Gad]]|date=31 May 2020|publisher=|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe cast also includes:{{cn|date=September 2022}}\n\n* [[Sala Baker]] as [[Sauron|Sauron the Deceiver]]:<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |title=Sala Baker |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bcac0937e |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=13 September 2022}}</ref> The Dark Lord of Mordor and the One Ring's true master who manifests as an [[Eye of Sauron|Eye]] after the destruction of his physical form.\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as [[Celeborn|Celeborn the Wise]]: The Elven-Lord of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]] and Galadriel's husband.\n* [[Lawrence Makoare]] as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* [[Craig Parker]] as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothl\u00f3rien.\n* [[Mark Ferguson]] as [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]: The last Elven-King of the [[Noldor]].\n* [[Peter McKenzie (actor)|Peter McKenzie]] as [[Elendil|Elendil the Tall]]: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* [[Harry Sinclair]] as [[Isildur]]: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n\n==Comparison with the source material==\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.<ref name=\"Story\">{{cite video |title=From Book to Screen |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2002}}</ref> The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven-year siege of the [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.<ref name=\"Letters\">{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J.R.R. |title=The Letters of J.

The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for timing reasons.<ref name=\"DirectorCommentary\">{{cite video |people=[[Peter Jackson]], [[Fran Walsh]], [[Philippa Boyens]] |title=Director/Writers Commentary |type=DVD |work=[[New Line Cinema]] |year=2002}}</ref> The filmmakers also decided to move the opening scenes of ''The Two Towers'', the Uruk-hai ambush and Boromir's death, to the film's linear climax.<ref name=\"Story\"/><ref name=\"DirectorCommentary\"/>\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance of the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though no one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]] on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a [[foreshadowing]] device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.<ref>{{cite news |last=Doman |first=Rejina |title=Can Hollywood Be Restrained? |work=Hollywood Jesus |date=7 January 2008 |url=http://live.hollywoodjesus.com/?p=1313 |access-date=31 January 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205175234/http://live.hollywoodjesus.com/?p=1313 |archive-date=5 February 2008}}</ref> One detail that many critics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket.

One notable illusion used in almost every scene involved setting a proper scale so that the characters all appear to be the correct height. For example, Elijah Wood is {{convert|5|ft|6|in|meter}} tall in real life, but his character, Frodo Baggins, is barely four feet in height. A variety of techniques were used to depict the hobbits and Gimli the Dwarf as being of diminutive stature. Fortunately, John-Rhys Davies&nbsp;\u2013 who played Gimli&nbsp;\u2013 happens to be the correct height in proportion to the hobbit actors, so did not need to be filmed separately as a third height variation. Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including [[Bag End]] in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast [[Panning (camera)|camera pan]] conceals the edit between the two. [[Forced perspective]] was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] and [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]]. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an elaborate [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animation system, called [[MASSIVE (software)|MASSIVE]], was developed by [[Stephen Regelous]]; it allowed thousands of individual animated characters, or \"agents\" in the program, to act independently. This lent the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: for instance, in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface texture was scanned from large [[maquette]]s before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the [[Balrog]], Gray Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n===Score===\n{{Main|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (soundtrack)|l1=''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (soundtrack)}}\n{{Broader|Music of The Lord of the Rings film series{{!}}Music of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\n\n[[James Horner]] turned down the offer to compose the score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/r-i-p-james-horner-1798281000|title = R.I.P.

It was performed by the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]], the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[London Voices]], The [[London Oratory School Schola]], and the Maori Samoan Choir, and featured several vocal soloists. Shore wrote almost four hours of finalized music for the film (of which just over three hours are used as underscore), featuring a number of non-orchestral instruments, and a large number (49\u201362) of [[Leitmotif|leitmotives]].\n\nTwo original songs, \"[[An\u00edron]]\" and the end title theme \"[[May It Be]]\", were composed and sung by [[Enya]], who allowed her label, [[Reprise Records]], to release the soundtrack to ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and its two sequels. In addition to these, Shore composed \"[[In Dreams (Howard Shore song)|In Dreams]]\", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe world premiere of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' was held at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 2001.
