It is based on the [[I Capture the Castle|1948 novel]] of the same name by [[Dodie Smith]], with the screenplay written by [[Heidi Thomas]]. The film was released in the UK on 9 May 2003.\n\n[[Romola Garai]] played the lead role of Cassandra Mortmain alongside [[Bill Nighy]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Tara Fitzgerald]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film follows 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, and her eccentric family, struggling to survive in genteel poverty in a decaying English castle. The characters include her father, a writer who hasn't written anything in the 12 years since the spectacular success of his first novel; her older sister Rose, who rails against their fate and hopes to marry for money; and their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] stepmother, Topaz, an ex-model still apt to sun-bathe in the nude. The possibility of salvation seems to loom in the form of their wealthy American landlord Simon Cotton and his brother Neil. Although Simon initially spurns her, Rose is determined to make him fall in love with her and succeeds. A wedding is arranged and Cassandra appears to be left on the sidelines. Cassandra is confused not only by her feelings for the Cottons but also for Stephen Colley. Stephen is the incredibly attractive son of the Mortmains' former chef who acts as a handyman to the family and is deeply in love with Cassandra. But events spiral out of control, and before the summer ends many expectations will have been overturned.\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were  shot in Laxey film studio on the [[Isle of Man]].
