Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation where Northup was held.\n\n''12 Years a Slave'' received widespread critical acclaim and was named the best film of 2013 by several media outlets and critics, and it earned over $187&nbsp;million on a production budget of $22&nbsp;million. The film received nine [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Ridley, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Nyong'o.

Two [[White Americans|white]] men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician in [[Washington, D.C.]]; instead, they drug Northup and deliver him to James H. Birch, who owns a [[slave pen]]. Northup is beaten when he proclaims his freedom.\n\nHe is shipped to [[New Orleans]] with other captives, who tell him he must adapt if he wants to survive in the [[Antebellum South|South]]. [[Domestic slave trade|Slave trader]] Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt\", a [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|runaway slave]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and sells him to [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation]] owner [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. Tension between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats breaks when Northup defends himself from Tibeats and beats him with his own whip. Tibeats and his men prepare to [[Lynching in the United States|lynch]] Northup, but are stopped by the [[plantation overseer|overseer]]. Northup is left on tiptoes with the noose around his neck for hours before Ford arrives and cuts him down. Northup attempts to explain his situation, but Ford sells him to Edwin Epps.\n[[File:Epps House.JPG|thumb|left|[[Edwin Epps House]], now located on the ground of [[Louisiana State University]], is a stop along Northrup's Trail. Solomon Northup and Samuel Bass helped build the house that was completed in 1852.]]\n\nEpps is ruthless and sadistic. Northup meets Patsey, favored slave and Epps' top [[cotton picker]]. Epps regularly [[rape]]s Patsey and his jealous wife abuses her. [[Cotton worm]]s destroy Epps' crops, so he leases his slaves to neighbor Judge Turner's plantation for the season. Turner favors Northup and allows him to play [[fiddle]] at a celebration and keep his earnings. Northup returns to Epps and pays [[Poor White|white field hand]] and former overseer Armsby to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby takes Northup's money but betrays him. Epps questions Northup at knifepoint but Northup convinces him Armsby is lying. Northup burns the letter. Patsey is caught by Epps going to a neighboring plantation to acquire soap, as Mrs. Epps will not let her have any. Epps orders Northup to whip Patsey, which he does, but Epps demands he strike her harder, eventually taking the whip and whipping Patsey nearly to death. Enraged, Northup destroys his violin.\n\nNorthup begins constructing a [[gazebo]] with [[Canadians|Canadian]] laborer [[Samuel Bass (abolitionist)|Samuel Bass]]. Bass, citing his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith, expresses opposition to slavery and castigates Epps, earning their enmity. Northup reveals his kidnapping to Bass and asks his help in sending his letter. Bass is hesitant because of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|risk]], but agrees. The [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] arrives and Northup recognizes his companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in New York. As they embrace, Epps furiously protests and tries to prevent Northup from leaving but is rebuffed. Northup bids farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.\n\nNorthup returns to reconnect with his wife, their fully grown son, daughter, and his daughter's husband. He is presented with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. He apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him.\n\nThe [[epilogue]] titles recount: Northup's unsuccessful lawsuits against Brown, Hamilton, and Birch; the 1853 publication of Northup's [[slave narrative]] memoir, ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''; his role in the [[abolitionist movement]]; and the absence of information regarding his death and burial.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast as Billed in film per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Do not any more names unless they are notable (and include citations)-->\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Billed one actor per screen -->\n*[[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Solomon Northup]] / Platt\n*[[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Edwin Epps]]\n*[[Lupita Nyong'o]] as [[Patsey]]\n*[[Sarah Paulson]] as Mary Epps\n*[[Paul Dano]] as John Tibeats\n*[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Mistress Harriet Shaw\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as [[Samuel Bass (abolitionist)|Samuel Bass]]\n*[[Adepero Oduye]] as Eliza\n*[[Garret Dillahunt]] as Armsby\n*[[Scoot McNairy]] as Merrill Brown\n*[[Taran Killam]] as Abram Hamilton\n*[[Christopher Berry]] as [[James H.

When read in conjunction, as in this anthology, there is a distinct repetitiveness. While this repetitiveness disallows the creativity and shaping of one's personal story, as Olney argues, it was equally important for slave narratives to follow a form that corroborated with the stories of others to create a collective picture of slavery as it then existed. In fact, the \"same\" form presented in all of these unique and individual stories created a powerful and resounding message of the consistent evils of slavery and the necessity of its demise.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://slavenarrativeanthology.weebly.com/introduction.html|access-date=2021-06-26|website=Every Tone a Testimony: An Anthology of Slave Narratives}}</ref>\n\nA journal article published by [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] and written by Sam Worley states that \"Northup's narrative, though well known, has often been treated as a narrative of the second rank, albeit one with an unusually exciting and involving story as well as, thanks to the research of its modern editors, [[Sue Eakin]] and [[Joseph Logsdon]], one with considerable historical value.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Sam|date=1997|title=Solomon Northup and the Sly Philosophy of the Slave Pen|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3299309|journal=Callaloo|volume=20|issue=1|pages=243\u2013259|doi=10.1353/cal.1997.0035|jstor=3299309|s2cid=161975602|issn=0161-2492}}</ref>\n\nNoah Berlatsky wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about a scene in McQueen's adaptation.

And, sure enough, the scene is not in the book.\" Berlatsky also states, \"the sequence is an effort to present nuance and psychological depth{{snd}}to make the film's depiction of slavery seem more real.
