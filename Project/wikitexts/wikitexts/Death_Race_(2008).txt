S. Anderson]]. It stars [[Jason Statham]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ian McShane]], and [[Joan Allen]].\n\nThough referred to as a remake of the 1975 film ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (which in turn is based on [[Ib Melchior]]'s short story \"The Racer\") in reviews and marketing materials, director Paul W. S. Anderson stated in the DVD commentary that he thought of the film as something of a [[prequel]].\n\nA remake had been in development since 2002, though production was delayed by disapproval of early [[screenplay]]s, then placed in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] following a dispute between [[Paramount Pictures]] and the producer duo [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Paula Wagner]] (the latter was the producer without Cruise in the film). ''Death Race'' was acquired by [[Universal Pictures]], and Anderson re-joined the project to write and direct. Filming began in [[Montreal]] in August 2007, and the completed project was released on August 22, 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $76 million worldwide.\n\nThree direct-to-video films in the series were then released: ''[[Death Race 2]]'' (2010), ''[[Death Race 3: Inferno]]'' (2013) and ''[[Death Race: Beyond Anarchy]]'' (2018).\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2012, the collapse of the US economy and the subsequent increase in crime rates leads to the rise of [[Private prison|privatized prisons]]. One such prison is Terminal Island Penitentiary, whose warden, Claire Hennessey, earns profits from broadcasting \"Death Race\", a vehicular combat racing series, on the internet. Throughout the season, Terminal Island inmates battle each other in specially modified cars on a track cut into the grounds, with the goal of winning their freedom.\n\nTowards the end of a race, a masked driver nicknamed [[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]] is nearing the finish line, pursued by his rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, reports that all of his defensive equipment has malfunctioned. Against her protests, Frankenstein refuses to let Joe finish first. Case ejects herself out of the car just before Joe destroys it as it crosses the finish line.\n\nIndustrial worker and ex-con Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at is closed, he returns home to his wife Suzy and their new-born daughter, Piper. A masked assailant knocks him unconscious. Jensen wakes up with a bloodied knife in his hand, Suzy dead nearby, and policemen storming into his home and arresting him. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while Piper is placed in foster care.\n\nSix months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. Hennessey's second in-command Ulrich calls Jensen to her office. She tells him that Frankenstein had died from the injuries he received at the end of the previous race, and offers to let Jensen go free if he drives Frankenstein's car to win one more race. Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's maintenance crew consisting of Coach, Gunner, and Lists; they explain to Jensen that Hennessey wants him to become Frankenstein to rebuild the profits and audience of \"Death Race\", which has halved since Frankenstein's \"disappearance\".\n\nOn the first day of the three day race, Jensen meets Case. During the race his vehicle's defensive equipment again mysteriously malfunctions. Jensen is distracted and blindsided by Joe when he sees Pachenko perform the same hand gesture at him as the masked assailant, causing Jensen to realize it was Pachenko who killed his wife. Jensen confronts Pachenko and attacks him after the race - prompting Pachenko to admit Hennessey ordered him to frame Jensen, so she can have a replacement for Frankenstein. On the second day, Jensen threatens to eject Case unless she tells the truth about the malfunctions. Case admits she sabotaged Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning and leaving Death Race, in exchange for her [[pardon|release papers]]. Jensen then makes Pachenko's car slam head-on into a concrete barrier, and exits the car to break Pachenko's neck. He and Joe then collaborate to destroy a multi-weapon tanker truck called the \"Dreadnought\", which was added to boost ratings. By the end of the second race day, all racers except Jensen and Joe are killed. Hennessey orders Ulrich to plant a bomb underneath Jensen's car in case he wins, knowing she can always find another person to impersonate Frankenstein. Jensen, who has realized Hennessey never intended to let anyone win their freedom from the start, approaches Joe after the race, suggesting they talk.\n\nOn the final race, Jensen and Joe collaborate again, destroying and driving through a weakened wall. Hennessey activates the bomb, not knowing it was removed and disassembled by Coach. She orders helicopters to pursue, though Jensen jumps out of the car as Case takes his place. Case is captured while Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train. Hennessey later opens a present sent due to record-breaking ratings, finding it to be the bomb she planted on Jensen's car. Coach detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich. Six months \"and 2000 miles later\", Joe and Jensen, reunited with Piper, are shown working in [[Mexico]] as mechanics, and are soon reunited with Case.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Jensen Garner Ames, a falsely-accused convicted prisoner coerced to drive in the arena, taking the name \"[[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]]\" from the man who came before him.

S. Anderson revealed that he was directing a remake of ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (1975) entitled ''Death Race 3000'' at [[Paramount Pictures]] based on a script by [[J. F. Lawton]]. The remake would be produced by the producer pair [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Paula Wagner]]. Anderson described the remake as a riff on the first film. \"It's not a straight remake at all. The first movie was an across-America race. This will be an around-the-world race. And it's set further in the future, so the cars are even more futuristic. So you've got cars with rockets, machine guns, force fields; cars that can split apart and re-form, a bit like [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers]]. Cars that become invisible,\" the director explained.<ref>{{cite news | author=Patrick Lee | url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw8235.html | title=Paul W. S.

The producer described the remake's new tone: \"We've basically taken the idea of reality television and extended it twenty years. So it's definitely a comment on society, and particularly reality television, but it is not as much a parody or a satire as the original.
