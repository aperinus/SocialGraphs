Gary Gray]]. It stars [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] as two expert hostage negotiators and Chicago police lieutenants. The film was released in the United States on July 29, 1998, receiving generally positive reviews from critics and grossing $88 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nLieutenant Danny Roman, a top [[hostage negotiator]] for the [[Chicago Police Department]]'s east precinct, is told by his partner, Nate Roenick, that according to an informant whom he refuses to name, members of their own unit are [[embezzlement|embezzling]] large amounts of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. Nate tells Roman that his informant hasn't told [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] because he thinks they might be involved as well. Roman goes to meet Nate, but finds him dead in his car with a bullet wound in his head and his car window shattered by gunfire before he can talk to him, and a squad car arrives on the scene within seconds, considering Roman a prime suspect.\n\nMatters become worse for Roman when IAD inspector Terence Niebaum, whom  Nate's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Nate, found in the lake next to Nate's car, is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search the Roman house and discover papers for an [[Offshore bank|offshore bank account]] with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is forced to surrender his gun and badge, and his colleagues are skeptical of his protests of innocence. With embezzlement and homicide charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum refuses to answer, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie, Roman's commander and friend Grant Frost and [[con artist|con man]] Rudy Timmons as hostages.\n\nWith the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], Roman issues his conditions: his badge, locating Nate's informant and killer, a department funeral if he dies and summoning police lieutenant Chris Sabian, the city's other top negotiator. Roman believes he can trust Sabian, because he talks for as long as possible, sees tactical action as a last resort, and being from the CPD's west precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme. Sabian clashes with Roman's precinct, particularly commander Adam Beck, but is given temporary command of the unit after they hastily attempt a breach that goes awry, resulting in [[SWAT]] officers Scott and Markus becoming hostages and Scott is supposedly killed.\n\nRoman trades Frost to Sabian in exchange for restoring the building's electricity, it having been turned off after the hostage execution. With help from Rudy and Maggie, Roman accesses Niebaum's computer and discovers the scheme: corrupt officers submitted false disability claims that were processed by an unknown insider on the disability fund's board. He also discovers recordings of [[Covert listening device|wiretaps]], including a conversation between Nate and his widow that suggests he was going to meet his informant before he was killed. Sabian, using the information Roman provided, claims to have located Nate's informant in a bid to get Roman to release the hostages. Roman realizes Sabian is bluffing when Niebaum's files reveal Nate himself was the IAD informant.\n\nWhen Roman threatens to expose Niebaum in his office's open window, leaving him vulnerable to [[sniper]] fire, Niebaum admits that Nate gave him wiretaps, implicating three of their squad mates in the embezzlement scheme: Allen, Hellman and Argento. When Niebaum confronted the guilty officers, he received a [[bribe]] from them to cover up their crimes. The guilty officers attempted to bribe Nate, but he refused to take the money, resulting in his murder. Niebaum says he doesn't know who the ringleader is, but that he has safely hidden the taps corroborating the three officers' guilt. The same corrupt officers have secretly entered the room via the air vents under the pretext of being part of a team to take Roman out in case he started killing hostages; upon hearing Niebaum's confession, they open fire and murder him before he can reveal where he has hidden the wiretaps. Roman single-handedly fends them and the rest of his squad off, using the flashbangs he seized from the two officers in the previous failed breach.\n\nBelieving that Sabian and the police can't resolve the situation, the FBI assume jurisdiction over the operation, cease negotiations, relieve the lieutenant of his command, and order a full breach. As Roman prepares for his eventual arrest, Maggie tells him that Niebaum also worked from his house and could have kept Nate's wiretaps there. Sabian confronts Roman to warn him about the breach, and the latter reveals that Scott is still alive and gagged with duct tape. Sabian begins to believe in Roman's innocence and gives him a chance to prove his case. While the FBI and SWAT raid the building and rescue the hostages, Roman disguises himself as a SWAT member and escapes through the vents.\n\nThe two negotiators proceed to Niebaum's house, but they can't find the wiretaps. The police arrive and the corrupt officers enter the house, but they back off as Frost enters and tries to talk Roman down. Sabian observes Frost discreetly locking the front door and taking one of the loaded guns and realizes that he is the ringleader of the conspiracy, the insider on the disability fund's board and Roenick's killer. In front of Frost, Sabian seemingly kills Roman and offers to destroy the evidence on [[floppy disks]] they have uncovered in return for a cut of Frost's take. Frost agrees and effectively makes a full admission to his and the other three officers' crimes before crushing the floppy disks and shooting Niebaum's computer. When Frost exits the house, he discovers that Sabian only wounded Roman, who used a police radio microphone to broadcast his entire confession to the police surrounding the area. Humiliated, Frost attempts to commit suicide, but is shot in the shoulder by Beck and arrested along with the other corrupt officers. As Roman is loaded into an ambulance with his wife, Sabian gives his badge to him and departs.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits and closing \u201cco-starring\u201d credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n*[[Samuel L.
