Later on, Bernie and Dan's recreational softball team, sponsored by local bar \"Mother's,\" plays against a local advertising agency and wins. Attending this game with her girlfriends is Debbie Sullivan, who works at the advertising company and is sleeping with her boss, Steve.\n\nDebbie catches Dan's eye and they flirt at the beer keg. She and her friends, Joan and Pat, decide to attend the game's afterparty at Mother's, where Debbie again runs into Dan, with whom Pat flirts and Joan takes an immediate dislike to. They wind up back at Dan's apartment and sleep together, after which Debbie hastily leaves.\n\nThe next day, Dan calls Debbie at work \"about last night,\" and asks her out on a second date, to which she accepts. Afterwards, they again wind up in bed together and spend the following day exploring the city, where Dan reveals to Debbie that his dream is to quit his job at a restaurant supply company and open his own restaurant. They begin dating more seriously and move in together, much to the chagrin of Joan and Bernie, who dislike each other as well.\n\nAs neither has ever been in a serious relationship before, they attempt to navigate cohabitation without much support from their friends. They experience much throughout their relationship: Dan being contacted by a former lover who is married with children, Debbie's boss Steve having difficulty accepting the end of their affair, Joan softening when she begins dating her new boyfriend Gary, a pregnancy scare, and Dan having difficulties with his boss, who wants him to stop providing supplies to the Swallow, an oldish diner owned by his client-turned-friend Gus.\n\nDespite having told each other the \u201c[[Love|L Word]],\u201d Debbie and Dan's relationship becomes strained. It reaches a boiling point at a [[New Year's Eve|New Year's Eve party]] at Mother's, where Debbie witnesses a drunken Pat making advances towards Dan, and Joan discovers her boyfriend is married and returning to his wife. Joan tearfully asks Debbie to take her home, to which she agrees, despite Dan's drunken objections. Upon Debbie's return home, Dan says he's not happy, and ends their relationship. Debbie immediately moves out of their apartment and back in with Joan. Despite getting back on the dating scene quickly, Dan begins to regret his decision regarding Debbie.\n\nAfter a few months he calls her and acts nonchalant; Debbie tells him to get lost and hangs up on him. He starts to lurk around Debbie's social outings, culminating in him telling her he made a mistake and misses her at the St. Patrick's Day celebration at Mother's. Debbie turns him down, saying, \"You asked me to leave and I left\" and that getting over him was the hardest thing she's ever had to do.\n\nHoping to move on with his life, Dan partners with Gus to revitalize the Swallow into an old-school diner, achieving his dream. That summer, at another softball game, Dan and Bernie see Debbie riding her bike through the park with Joan, who convinces her to go and talk to Dan. She approaches him and they both express regret at how their relationship turned out. As Debbie begins to turn away, Dan asks her out again and suggests they go to a great new place, but she suggests with a smile that they just go to \"some old joint,\" signifying that she is aware of his new restaurant. As she rides away on her bike, Bernie convinces Dan to run after her, and the camera pans out to see Dan and Debbie passing through the park, hinting at their renewed relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Danny Martin\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Debbie Sullivan\n* [[James Belushi]] as Bernie Litko\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Joan Gunther \n* [[George DiCenzo]] as Mr. Favio\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Steve Carlson\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Pat\n* [[Sachi Parker]] as Carrie\n* [[Michael Alldredge]] as Mother Malone\n* [[Rosanna DeSoto]] as Mrs. Lyons (as Rosana De Soto)\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Cocktail Waitress\n* [[Ada Maris]] as Carmen\n* Joe Greco as Gus \n* Robert Neches as Gary\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, grossing $38,702,310 domestically.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aboutlastnight.htm |title=About Last Night...
