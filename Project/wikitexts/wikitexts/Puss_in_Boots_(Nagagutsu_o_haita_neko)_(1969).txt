In 2016, a new 3D on-screen logo featuring Pero was revealed in celebration of the company's 60th anniversary.

After Pero escapes to avoid punishment, the Feline King dispatches three bumbling assassins to find and capture Pero, warning them that they face execution should they fail. Pero begins his journey, (all the while dodging his would-be captors throughout the adventure) soon meeting young Pierre, a poor, neglected miller's son who is ousted from his home. The two quickly become good friends and set off together across the countryside. They eventually arrive at a bustling kingdom where a ceremony has begun in which to select a suitable prince who shall wed the lonely, innocent Princess Rosa. Pero sees potential in Pierre as the perfect candidate and hurries into the castle to begin his plan, much to Pierre's opposition. Misfortune soon enshrouds the kingdom as Lucifer, an ogre sorcerer, appears displaying his awesome magical abilities with promises of power and riches if Rosa becomes his bride. Despite the King's excited willingness, Rosa sternly declines Lucifer's offer which enrages him with disappointment. He threatens the King with a terrifying demonstration of the darkness that will befall his country if Rosa is not surrendered to him in three days time. Pero, now dumbfounded, witnesses this shocking event and what was once a simple mission of persuasion has now become more than he ever bargained for.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Japan theatrically on March 18, 1969.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=328}}\n\nThe AIP English dub version was first released on VHS twice, first by [[Vestron Video]] in 1982 (under licensed from then-owner [[Orion Pictures]]) and by [[Media Home Entertainment]] in 1985, then by [[Hi-Tops Video]].
