The plot is about a rich, spoiled [[figure skating|figure skater]] (played by [[Moira Kelly]]) who is paired with an injury-sidelined [[ice hockey]] player (played by [[D. B. Sweeney]]) for [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating. Competing at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] in [[Albertville]], France, they have a climactic face off against a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pair. It spawned a [[The Cutting Edge (film series)|film series]] including a number of sequels. The film was primarily shot in [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fleischer |first=David |date=May 24, 2012 |title=Reel Toronto: ''The Cutting Edge'' |work=Torontoist |url=https://torontoist.com/2012/05/reel-toronto-the-cutting-edge/ |access-date=September 8, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=''The Cutting Edge'' |work=AFI Catalog |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/59220 |access-date=September 8, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nKate Moseley is a world-class figure skater representing the United States in the pairs event at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]]. She has genuine talent, but years of being spoiled by her wealthy widower father Jack has made her impossible to work with.\n\nDoug Dorsey is captain of the U.S. ice hockey team at the same Winter Olympics. Just minutes before a game, he and Kate collide in a hallway in the arena. During the game, Doug suffers a head injury that permanently damages his peripheral vision, costing him a shot to play in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and forcing him to retire from ice hockey. During Kate's event, her partner apparently accidentally drops her, albeit with little sign of regret or concern, during their program, costing them a chance at the [[gold medal]].\n\nWhile training for the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] over the next two years, Kate drives away all potential skating partners with her attitude and perfectionism. Her coach, Russian native Anton Pamchenko, has to find a replacement, an outsider who doesn't know that Kate is spoiled and difficult.\n\nHe tracks down Doug, who is back home in [[Minnesota]], working in a steel mill and as a carpenter on the side, living with his brother, and playing in a [[semi-professional|hockey bar league]]. Desperate for another chance at Olympic glory, Doug agrees to work as Kate's partner, even though he has macho contempt for figure skating.\n\nKate's snooty, [[prima donna]] behavior gets on his nerves immediately, and their first few practices do not go well as they antagonize one another. However, they develop a mutual respect as both strive to outdo one another in work ethic.\n\nAs their relationship grows warmer, they learn to set aside their differences, becoming a pair to be reckoned with both on and off the ice. Kate even boldly defends Doug to her former coach who patronizes and insults them, and Doug defends his unusual choice of sport to his own family and friends, whom he had expected to mock him.\n\nAt the U.S. Nationals, despite strong performances in the short program and long program, they place third and their Olympic dreams are shattered. However, when one of the leading pairs falls during the competition, they advance to second place, earning their spot on the Olympic team.\n\nTheir potential is threatened, however, by their growing attraction to each other. Kate attempts to seduce Doug after a night of drunken celebration, revealing that she broke off her engagement to wealthy financier Hale. Usually a ladies' man, Doug uncharacteristically rebuffs her advances, fearing the possibility of regret and loss of respect for one another. When Kate discovers that Doug has bedded another woman (a rival skater) almost immediately after leaving her to sleep off her intoxication, she becomes enraged. The temporary rift is set aside, however, as they attempt to train a risky skating move invented by Pamchenko, which will assure them a gold medal if they can pull it off without serious injury.\n\nAt the finals at the [[Albertville]] Olympics, they look to be one of the top pairs competing for the gold. Yet another argument threatens their chemistry on the ice, and in the process Doug and Kate both discover that Kate is the fallible partner after all. Before getting on the ice for their decisive performance, Doug professes to Kate that he\u2019s fallen in love with her, leaving Kate overcome with emotion, and she decides they are going to do the Pamchenko. They proceed to skate with a passion neither had shown before, performing the Pamchenko flawlessly. Kate tells Doug she loves him too.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[D. B.
