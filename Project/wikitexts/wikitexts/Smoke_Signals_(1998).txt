The film won several awards and accolades, and was well received at numerous film festivals.\n\nIn 2018, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/64bed08db5f44f69a34bd2e9678f5d40|title='Jurassic Park,' 'Shining' added to National Film Registry|website=Associated Press|date=December 12, 2018|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nVictor Joseph and Thomas Builds-the-Fire live on the [[Coeur d'Alene Reservation|Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation]] in [[Plummer, Idaho]]. Thomas is an eccentric storyteller and Victor is an angry young man who enjoys playing [[basketball]].\n\nVictor and Thomas are brought together through Victor's father, Arnold. Arnold rescued Thomas as an infant from a house fire that killed his parents. Because of this, Thomas considers him a hero. On the other hand, Victor, who endures Arnold's [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], and eventual [[child abandonment]], regards his father with both deep love and bitter resentment. Thomas and Victor grow up together as neighbors and acquaintances, fighting with each other and simultaneously forming a close, albeit uneasy, friendship.\n\nWhen Arnold dies in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he has stayed after leaving Victor and his mother Arlene, Victor and Thomas go on an adventure to retrieve his ashes. The trip is the means for Victor and Thomas to explore their identities. Neither of them loses sight of his identity as an \"[[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]\", but their perspectives differ. Victor is more stoic and Thomas is more traditional (and romantic to the point of watching the feature film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' countless times). Their dichotomy is portrayed all through the film; it results in Victor being irritated with Thomas, and Thomas being fascinated with Victor.\n\nOnce they reach Phoenix, Victor has to confront his conflicted feelings about his father, as well as his own identity. He has to grapple with a new account of Thomas's parents' death, as told by his father's friend, Suzy Song. She says that a drunken Arnold set off fireworks, accidentally starting the fire that cost Thomas his parents. The road trip by the young men leads to Thomas reconciling with the memory of his adoptive father Arnold, as he understands more of his path to alcoholism and related abuse and abandonment. Victor also gains a better understanding of Thomas and his reverence for Arnold. Victor and Thomas eventually throw Arnold's ashes into a river as a form of acceptance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Victor Joseph\n** [[Cody Lightning]] as young Victor Joseph\n* [[Evan Adams]] as Thomas Builds-the-Fire\n** [[Simon Baker (Canadian actor)|Simon Baker]] as young Thomas Builds-the-Fire\n* [[Irene Bedard]] as Suzy Song\n* [[Gary Farmer]] as Arnold Joseph\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Arlene Joseph\n* [[John Trudell]] as Randy Peone\n* [[Michael Greyeyes]] as Junior Polatkin\n* [[Michelle St. John]] as Velma\n* [[Elaine Miles]] as Lucy\n* [[Cynthia Geary]] as Cathy the gymnast\n* [[Perrey Reeves]] as Holly\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Penny Cicero\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Burt Cicero\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as police chief\n}}\n\n==Production==\nWhile it was not the first film created by native filmmakers in the United States, ''Smoke Signals'' is recognized as being the first feature-length film written, directed, and produced by Native Americans to reach a wide audience both in the US and abroad. This film is also notable for its authenticity with regard to its cast of Native American actors and actresses, and because it was filmed on location on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Smoke Signals'' was well received by mainstream critics.
