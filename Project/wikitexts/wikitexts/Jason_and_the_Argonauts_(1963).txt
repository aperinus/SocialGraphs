It was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]], directed by [[Don Chaffey]], and stars [[Todd Armstrong]], while co-starring [[Nancy Kovack]], [[Honor Blackman]], and [[Gary Raymond]].\n\nShot in [[Eastman Color]], the film was made in collaboration with [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] master [[Ray Harryhausen]] and is known for its various [[legendary creature]]s, notably the iconic fight scene featuring seven [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton warriors]]. Although it was a box-office disappointment during its initial release, the film was critically acclaimed and later became a cult classic.\n\nThe film score was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]], who had partnered with Harryhausen on ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958), ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'' (1960) and ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1961).\n\n==Plot==\n[[Pelias]] usurps the throne of [[Thessaly]], killing [[Aeson|King Aristo]], but knows that a prophecy states that one of Aristo's children will avenge him. The god [[Hermes]], disguised as Pelias's soothsayer, watches as the infant [[Jason]], Aristo's son, is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of Aristo's daughters after she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess [[Hera]]. Because the murder has profaned her temple, Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware of \"a one-[[sandal]]ed man\".\n\nTwenty years later, Jason saves Pelias from drowning in a river, an \"accident\" orchestrated by Hera, but loses his sandal in the process, so Pelias recognizes his enemy. Learning that Jason intends to seek the legendary [[Golden Fleece]] to rally support against him, he encourages Jason in the attempt, hoping that Jason will be killed.\n\nHermes takes Jason to [[Mount Olympus]] to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed that she can help him only five times. This is the same number of times that Jason's murdered sister Briseis called on Hera for protection. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of [[Colchis]]. Zeus offers aid, but Jason declines.\n\nHe sets out to build a ship and recruit a crew. Men from all over [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] compete for the honor of joining his quest. Because their ship is named the ''[[Argo]]'' after her builder, [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argus]], the crew are dubbed the [[Argonauts]]. Among them are [[Hercules]], [[Hylas]], and [[Acastus]], the son of Pelias (unknown to Jason), sent by his father to sabotage the voyage.\n\nHera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a building filled with treasure and surmounted by a gigantic bronze statue of [[Talos]]. The statue comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos's heel to release the giant's [[ichor]]. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas and hiding his body. Hercules refuses to leave until he ascertains the fate of his friend. The other Argonauts are unwilling to abandon Hercules, so Jason calls upon Hera again. She informs them that Hylas is dead and that Zeus has other plans for Hercules.\n[[File:Jason and the Argonauts (1963) Hydra fight.png|thumb|right|The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] battle sequence.]]\nHera directs Jason to seek out [[Phineus]], who has been blinded and is tormented by [[Harpy|harpies]] for misusing Zeus's gift of prophesy. After the Argonauts capture and cage the harpies, Phineus tells them how to reach Colchis, by sailing between the [[Symplegades|Clashing Rocks]]. He also gives Jason an amulet of the sea god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. The Argonauts see another ship trying to pass through the other way, only to be crushed and sunk when the Clashing Rocks smash together. Upon Jason's refusal to turn back, when the ''Argo'' tries to row through, the ship appears doomed as well. In despair, Jason throws Phineus's amulet into the water, whereupon Triton rises up and holds the rocks apart long enough for the ''Argo'' to pass. Upon clearing the rocks, the Argonauts rescue a survivor from the other ship lost, the wonderfully and deadly attractive [[Medea]], high priestess of Colchis.\n\nFinally nearing Colchis, Acastus challenges Jason's authority and engages him in a duel. Disarmed, Acastus jumps into the sea and disappears. Jason and his men land and accept an invitation from King [[Ae\u00ebtes]] to a feast. Unknown to them, Acastus has warned Ae\u00ebtes of Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece. Ae\u00ebtes has the unwary Argonauts imprisoned, but Medea, having fallen in love with Jason, helps him and his men escape.\n\nAcastus tries to steal the Fleece first, but is killed by its guardian, the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. Jason is able to kill the beast and take the Fleece. Medea is mortally wounded by an arrow, but Jason heals her with the Fleece. Ae\u00ebtes then sows the Hydra's teeth and prays to the goddess [[Hecate]]. Seven armed [[Skeleton (undead)|skeletons]], the \"[[Spartoi|children of the Hydra's teeth]]\", emerge from the ground. Jason, [[Phalerus]] and [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], hold them off, while Medea and Argus escape back to the ''Argo'' with the Fleece. After a prolonged battle, in which his companions are killed, Jason escapes by jumping into the sea,<ref>It took Ray Harryhausen well over three months to animate the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] sequence.</ref> and he, Medea, and the surviving Argonauts begin their voyage home to Thessaly. On Olympus, Zeus tells Hera that, while Jason can enjoy his triumph, he is not done with Jason.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Todd Armstrong]] as [[Jason]] (dubbed by [[Tim Turner]], uncredited)\n* [[Nancy Kovack]] as [[Medea]] (dubbed by Eva Haddon, uncredited)\n* [[Gary Raymond]] as [[Acastus]]\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argus]]\n* [[Niall MacGinnis]] as [[Zeus]]\n* [[Michael Gwynn]] as [[Hermes]]/priest\n* [[Douglas Wilmer]] as [[Pelias]]\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as [[Ae\u00ebtes|King Ae\u00ebtes]]\n* [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Hera]]\n* [[John Cairney]] as [[Hylas]]\n* [[Patrick Troughton]] as [[Phineus]]\n* [[Andrew Faulds]] as [[Phalerus]]\n* [[Nigel Green]] as [[Hercules]]\n* [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]] as [[Castor and Pollux|Polydeuces]] (uncredited)\n* [[Ferdinando Poggi]] as [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] (uncredited)\n* [[Bill Gudgeon (actor)|Bill Gudgeon]] as [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] (uncredited)\n* [[Doug Robinson (actor)|Doug Robinson]] as [[Euphemus|Eupaemus]] (uncredited) \n* [[Davina Taylor]] as [[Briseis]] (uncredited)\n* [[Aldo Cristiani]] as [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Film score===\nThe film is one of the mythically-themed fantasies scored by [[Bernard Herrmann]]. Apart from being the composer's fourth collaboration with [[Ray Harryhausen]] (''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', ''[[The 3 Worlds of Gulliver]]'', and ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', made in 1958, 1960, and 1961 respectively), Herrmann also scored the [[science fiction film]]s ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/artist/bernard-herrmann-p94132|title=Bernard Herrmann &#124; Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos|website=AllMovie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2ba0b03e8c|title=Bernard Herrmann|website=BFI}}</ref>\n\nContrasting with Herrmann's all-string score for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the film's soundtrack was made without a string section. This leaves the brass and percussion to perform the heroic fanfares, and the woodwinds along with additional instruments (such as the harp) to dominate in the more subtle and romantic parts.\n\nIn 1995, Intrada released a re-recording of the original score. The new version was conducted by American composer/conductor [[Bruce Broughton]], and performed by the Sinfonia of London.\n\n===Differences from classical mythology===\n[[File:Building Argo BM TerrD603.jpg|thumb|Athena helps build the [[Argo]], Roman moulded [[terracotta]] plaque, first century AD]]\nThe film differs in some ways from the traditional telling in [[Greek mythology]]:\n* Pelias does not kill his half-brother<ref>Both shared a common mother, the beautiful [[Tyro]]; King Aristo's father was [[Cretheus]], the lawful husband of Tyro and [[Pelias]]' father was the god [[Poseidon]].</ref> King Aristo (Aeson) but instead had him imprisoned. Eventually, it is Medea, and not Jason, who kills Pelias; she demonstrates to Pelias' daughters that she can rejuvenate an old ram<ref>In some accounts, it is King Aristo ([[Aeson]]) who [[Medea]] rejuvenates.</ref> into a young one by killing, chopping and boiling it in a pot. She promises to do the same for Pelias, so his daughters kill and chop him. However, Medea breaks her word and Pelias remains dead.\n* Hera does not attempt to kill Pelias herself by drowning him in the river [[Anavros]]. Instead, in order to prove Jason's virtuous heart to Zeus, she disguises herself as an old woman unable to cross on her own. Jason, feeling sympathy for the lady, ferries her across on his back but loses a sandal into its depths.\n* In [[myth]]ology, the Argonauts encountered [[Talos]] on their return journey after they had obtained the [[Golden Fleece]]. He was defeated not by Jason, but by Medea casting a spell on Talos, causing him to remove the bronze nail from his ankle which kept the ichor inside. The mythological Talos guarded Crete, not the \"Isle of Bronze\", and was protecting not a treasure, but [[Europa (mythology)|Queen Europa]].\n* In the film, Hylas was killed when the crumbling remains of Talos crushed him. However, in mythology, Hylas was actually kidnapped by a [[naiad]] who fell in love with him as he took a drink from a spring. When Hercules could not find him, he believed him to still be alive, and stayed behind on the island to look for him (as in the film).\n* The harpies were not caught in a net or caged, but were chased away by the [[Boreads]]: Cala\u00efs and Zetes (also Zethes)<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', book II; [[Ovid]] XIII, 710; [[Virgil]] III, 211, 245</ref>\n* In the film, the god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] saved the ''Argo'' from destruction passing through the [[Symplegades|Clashing Rocks]]: however; according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], Phineus instructed Jason to release a dove and if the bird makes it through, row with all their might and the goddess [[Athena]] provided the extra push to the ship needed to clear them; \"the Argo darted from the rocks like a flying arrow\". Another source is [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which [[Circe]] tells [[Odysseus]]: \"One ship alone, one deep-sea craft sailed clear, the Argo, sung by the world, when heading home from Ae\u00ebtes shores. And she would have crashed against those giant rocks and sunk at once if Hera, for her love of Jason, had not sped her through\".<ref>The [[Odyssey]], Book XII, 80</ref>\n* Jason was not betrayed by Acastus in the classical tale. Jason openly told King Ae\u00ebtes that he had come for the Fleece. The king promised Jason could have it if he performed three tasks, knowing full well they were impossible. However, Jason was able to complete the tasks with the help of Medea. It was not the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] that protected the Fleece but rather a [[dragon]]. Jason did not slay it, but instead, Medea cast a spell on it, causing it to fall asleep. Jason sowed the dragon's teeth into the ground, not Ae\u00ebtes. Jason defeated the \"dragon's offspring\" (the [[spartoi]]) by making them fight among themselves and destroy each other, rather than battling them with his colleagues.\n* One of the two Argonauts killed by the [[Skeleton (undead)|skeletons]] is [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], who in Greek mythology would perish much later as the result of a feud with [[Idas]] and [[Lynceus (Argonaut)|Lynceus]]. The other is [[Phalerus]], who in mythology would also survive the adventures of the Argonauts.\n* The film ultimately omits the story of Medea killing and butchering her own brother, [[Absyrtus]], to help Jason and the Argonauts escape;<ref>In an interview with John Landis, John said \"I noticed you left out [[Medea]]\"; Ray responded \"We had to\"</ref> and also the episodes with [[Cyzicus]], the Gegeines and the Argonauts' stay on the isle of [[Lemnos]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received critical acclaim and is now considered a classic. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating of 89% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.
