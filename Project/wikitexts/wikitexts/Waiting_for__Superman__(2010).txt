Things such as the ease in which a public school teacher achieves [[tenure]], the inability to fire a teacher who is tenured, and how the system attempts to reprimand poorly performing teachers are shown to affect the educational environment. Teaching standards are called into question as there is often conflicting bureaucracy between teaching expectations at the school, state, or federal level.\n\nThe film also examines teacher's unions. [[Michelle Rhee]], the former chancellor of the Washington, D.C. public schools (the district with some of the worst-performing students at the time), is shown attempting to take on the union agreements that teachers are bound to, but suffers a backlash from the unions and the teachers themselves.\n\nStatistical comparisons are made between the different types of primary or secondary educational institutions available: [[state school]], [[private school]], and [[charter school]]. There are also comparisons made between schools in affluent neighborhoods versus schools in poorer ones. Since charter schools do not operate with the same restrictions as public institutions, they are depicted as having a more experimental approach to educating students.\n\nSince many charter schools are not large enough to accept all of their applicants, the selection of students is done by lottery. The film follows several families as they attempt to gain access to prominent charter schools for their children.\n\n==Details==\n\n===Cast===\n* [[Geoffrey Canada]]\n* The Esparza Family\n* The Hill Family\n* The Jones Family\n* The Black Family\n* [[Michelle Rhee]]\n* [[Bill Strickland]]\n* [[Randi Weingarten]]\n* [[Eric Hanushek]]\n* The Zell Family\n\n===Release===\n''Waiting for \"Superman\"'' premiered in the US on September 24, 2010, in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, with a rolling wider release that began on October 1, 2010.

The film does note, however, that most charter schools do not outperform public schools and focuses on those that do. It also states that only one in five charter schools outperform public schools (close to the 17% statistic).]]\n\nAuthor and academic Rick Ayers lambasted the accuracy of the film, describing it as \"a slick marketing piece full of half-truths and distortions\" and criticizing its focus on [[standardized testing]].<ref name = \"AyersHP\">Rick Ayers, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rick-ayers-/an-inconvenient-superman-_b_716420.html?view=print An Inconvenient Superman: Davis Guggenheim's New Film Hijacks School Reform], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', September 17, 2010</ref> In Ayers' view, the \"corporate powerhouses and the ideological opponents of all things public\" have employed the film to \"break the teacher's unions and to privatize education,\" while driving teachers' wages even lower and running \"schools like little [[corporation]]s.\"<ref name = \"AyersHP\" /> Lastly, Ayers writes that \"schools are more segregated today than before ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' in 1954,\" and thus criticized the film for not mentioning that \"black and brown students are being suspended, expelled, searched, and criminalized.\"<ref name = \"AyersHP\" />\n\n[[Diane Ravitch]], Research Professor of Education at [[New York University]] and a nonresident senior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], similarly criticizes the film's lack of accuracy.<ref name=\"Ravitch\">{{cite web|last=Ravitch|first=Diane|title=The Myth of Charter Schools|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/11/myth-charter-schools/?pagination=false|work = [[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=2010-10-26|date=2010-11-11}}</ref> The most substantial distortion in the film, according to Ravitch, is the film's claim that \"70 percent of eighth-grade students cannot read at grade level,\" a misrepresentation of data from the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]].<ref name=\"Ravitch\" /> Ravitch served as a board member with the NAEP and says that \"the NAEP doesn't measure performance in terms of grade-level achievement,\" as claimed in the film, but only as \"advanced,\" \"proficient,\" and \"basic.\" The film assumes that any student below proficient is \"below grade level,\" but this claim is not supported by the NAEP data. Ravitch says that a study by [[Stanford University]] economist Margaret Raymond of 5000 charter schools found that only 17% are superior in math test performance to a matched public school, and many perform badly, casting doubt on the film's claim that privately managed charter schools are the solution to bad public schools.<ref name=\"Ravitch\" /> (The film says, however, that it is focusing on the one in five superior charter schools, or close to 17%, that do outperform public schools.) One of the reasons for the high test scores, writes Ravitch, is that many charter schools expel low-performing students to bring up their average scores. Ravitch also writes that many charter schools are involved in \"unsavory real estate deals\" <ref name=\"Ravitch\" />\n\nIn 2011, many news media reported on a testing score \"cheating scandal\" at Rhee's schools, because the test answer sheets contained a suspiciously high number of erasures that changed wrong answers to right answers. They asked Rhee whether the pressure on teachers led them to cheat. Rhee said that only a small number of teachers and principals cheated. Ravitch said that \"cheating, teaching to bad tests, institutionalized fraud, dumbing down of tests, and a narrowed curriculum\" were the true outcomes of Rhee's tenure in D.C. schools.<ref>{{cite
