They share a [[Mobile home|trailer]] on the outskirts of [[Phoenix, Maryland]], next to a [[Yard globe|gazing ball]] and a pair of [[Plastic flamingo|plastic pink flamingos]]. After learning that Divine has been named \"the filthiest person alive\" by a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble attempt to usurp her title.\n\nThe Marbles run a [[black market]] baby ring: they kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. The proceeds are used to finance pornography shops and a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also earns money by [[Exhibitionism|exposing himself]]{{snd}} with a large [[kielbasa]] sausage or turkey neck tied to his penis{{snd}} to women and stealing their purses when they flee. One of Raymond's would-be targets, a [[transgender]] woman who has not completed [[gender reassignment surgery]], thwarts his scheme by exposing her breast, penis, and scrotum, causing Raymond to flee in shock.\n\nThe Marbles enlist a spy, Cookie, to gather information about Divine by dating Crackers. In one of the film's most infamous scenes, Cookie gets raped by Crackers while [[Crush fetish|crushing a live chicken between them]] as Cotton [[Voyeurism|looks on through a window]]. Cookie then informs the Marbles about Babs' real identity, her whereabouts, and her family{{snd}} as well as her upcoming birthday party.\n\nThe Marbles send a box of human feces to Divine as a birthday present with a card addressing her as \"Fatso\" and proclaiming themselves \"the filthiest people alive\". Worried that her title has been seized, Divine declares that whoever sent the package must die. While the Marbles are gone, Channing dresses in Connie's clothes and imitates his employers' overheard conversations. When the Marbles return home, they are outraged to find Channing mocking them, so they fire him and lock him in his \"room\" (a closet).\n\nThe Marbles arrive at the trailer to spy on Divine's birthday party. Her birthday gifts include [[poppers]], [[fake vomit]], lice shampoo, a pig's head, and a meat cleaver. Entertainers include a topless woman with a snake act and a contortionist who flexes his [[rectal prolapse|prolapsed anus]] in rhythm to the song \"[[Surfin' Bird]]\". Disgusted by the outrageous party, the Marbles call the police, but this backfires when Divine and her guests ambush the officers, hack up their bodies with the meat cleaver, and [[Cannibalism|eat them]]. The Egg Man, who delivers eggs to Edie daily, confesses his love for her and proposes marriage. She accepts his proposal and he carts her off in a wheelbarrow.\n\nDivine and Crackers head to the Marbles' house, where they lick and rub the furniture, which excites them so much that Divine [[oral sex|fellates]] Crackers. They find Channing and discover two pregnant women held captive in the basement. After Divine and Crackers free the women with a large knife, the women use the knife to [[Emasculation|emasculate]] Channing.\n\nThe Marbles burn Divine's beloved trailer to the ground; when they return home, their furniture{{snd}} cursed by being licked by Divine and Crackers{{snd}} \"rejects\" them: when they try to sit down, the cushions fly up and throw them to the floor. They also find that Channing has bled to death from his emasculation and the two girls have escaped.\n\nAfter finding the remains of their burned-out trailer, Divine and Crackers return to the Marbles' home, kidnap them at gunpoint, and bring them to the arson site. Divine calls the local tabloid media to witness the Marbles' trial and execution. Divine holds a [[kangaroo court]] and convicts the bound-and-gagged Marbles of \"first-degree stupidity\" and \"assholism\". Cotton and Crackers recommend a sentence of execution, so the Marbles are tied to a tree, coated in [[Tarring and feathering|tar and feathers]], and shot in the head by Divine.\n\nDivine, Crackers, and Cotton enthusiastically decide to move to [[Boise, Idaho]].  Spotting a small dog [[Defecation|defecating]] on the sidewalk, Divine scoops up the feces with her hand and [[Coprophagia|puts them in her mouth]]{{snd}} proving, as the [[voice-over]] narration by Waters states, that Divine is \"not only the filthiest person in the world, but she is also the filthiest actress in the world\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] as Divine/Babs Johnson\n* [[David Lochary]] as Raymond Marble\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Connie Marble\n* [[Mary Vivian Pearce]] as Cotton\n* Danny Mills as Crackers\n* [[Edith Massey (actress)|Edith Massey]] as Edie\n* [[Cookie Mueller]] as Cookie\n* [[Channing Wilroy]] as Channing\n* [[Paul Swift]] as The Egg Man\n* [[Susan Walsh (actress)|Susan Walsh]] as Suzie\n* Linda Olgierson as Linda\n* Pat Moran as Patty Hitler\n* [[Steve Yeager (filmmaker)|Steve Yeager]] as Nat Curzan\n* [[George Figgs]] as Bongo player\n* [[Vincent Peranio]] as Musician at party\n* [[Van Smith]] as Party guest\n* [[Elizabeth Coffey]] as a [[transgender woman]] who shocks Raymond\n* David E.

The event was held on the campus of the [[University of Baltimore]], where it sold out tickets for three successive screenings. The film had aroused particular interest among fans of underground cinema following the success of ''[[Multiple Maniacs]]'', which had begun to be screened in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.<ref>[[#Mil01|Milstead, Heffernan and Yeager 2001]]. pp.&nbsp;66\u201367.</ref>\n\n[[File:WLA filmlinc Joyce Theater 5 crop.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Joyce Theater]] in 2009; this building formerly housed the Elgin Theater, where ''Pink Flamingos'' was screened as a midnight movie for several years in the early 1970s.]]\nBeing picked up by the then-small independent company [[New Line Cinema]], ''Pink Flamingos'' was later distributed to [[Ben Barenholtz]], the owner of the [[Elgin Theater]] in New York City. At the Elgin Theater, Barenholtz had been promoting the [[midnight movie]] scene, primarily by screening [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s [[acid western]] film ''[[El Topo]]'' (1970), which had become a \"very significant success\" in \"micro-independent terms\".

Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the lines in the film, and recited them at the screenings, a phenomenon which later became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975).<ref>[[#Mil01|Milstead, Heffernan and Yeager 2001]]. pp.&nbsp;70\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Ban===\nThe film was initially [[List of banned films|banned]] in Switzerland and Australia, as well as in some provinces in Canada and Norway.<ref name=\"Harrington\"/> The film was eventually released uncut on VHS in Australia in 1984 with an X rating, but distribution of the video has since been discontinued. The 1997 version was cut by the distributor to achieve an R18+ after it was also refused classification. No submissions of the film have been made since, but it has been said that one of the reasons for which it was banned (as a film showing [[Unsimulated sex|actual sexual activity]] cannot be rated X in Australia if it also features violence, so the highest a film such as ''Pink Flamingos'' could be rated is R18+) would now not apply, given that the depiction of actual sex was passed within the R18+ rating for ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' in 1999, two years following ''Pink Flamingos''{{'}} re-release.<ref>[http://refused-classification.com/censorship/films/p.html#pink-flamingos Films: P].

In an interview not in character, Harris Milstead revealed that he soon called an emergency room nurse, pretending that his child had eaten dog feces, to inquire about possible harmful effects (there were none).<ref>''[[Divine Waters]]'', 1985</ref> The scene became one of the most notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that \"I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit \u2013 plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about\".
