It stars [[Martin Lawrence]] as a disgraced [[college basketball]] coach who returns to his old middle school to coach the boys' basketball team.\n\nThis was also [[Tara Correa-McMullen|Tara Correa]]'s only film role. She was murdered in a gang shooting on October 21, 2005, three months after the film's release.<ref name=\"murder\">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/01/post-3.html|title=Gang member convicted of murdering 'Judging Amy' actress|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCoach Roy McCormick was once college basketball's top mastermind. His attention began to turn to what endorsement contracts he could secure instead of actually coaching his team. Roy lets his temper get the best of him in most situations. After causing a mishap with a mascot, the board bans McCormick from collegiate basketball until he can show that he can control his anger. Roy's reputation has doomed him to being un-hireable as a long time passes with no job offers. However, McCormick then gets one job offer, from Mount Vernon Junior High School which was also where he graduated as a teenager. His alma mater's basketball team, the Smelters, is looking for somebody to coach the team, and the headmistress thinks an alumnus of his caliber in basketball would be ideal. Although irritated, Roy realizes he has no other options and accepts the coaching job, figuring this is the way to prove he can control his anger and get back into the spotlight of college basketball. As Roy begins coaching the squad, he gets into an embarrassing situation that he's never been in before and decides, enough is enough. He eventually starts teaching the concepts of basketball to his new team, albeit placing paramount emphasis on sportsmanship.  With teaching and learning being done between both Roy and the kids, the Smelters eventually start having success. Unexpectedly, this leads Roy to find out he's been missing his simple love of the game the whole time. Eventually Roy gains a new appreciation for his old school and figures that while it does not lead to big money endorsements, he can earn a comfortable living from this job.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Coach Roy McCormick / Preacher Don McCormick, Roy's identical twin brother\n* [[Wendy Raquel Robinson]] as Jeanie Ellis\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Tim Fink\n* [[Horatio Sanz]] as Mr. Newirth\n* [[Oren Williams]] as Keith Ellis, Jeanie's son\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Larry Burgess\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Principal Mary Walsh\n* [[Eddy Martin]] as One Love\n* [[Steven Christopher Parker]] as \"Sledgehammer\" Big Wes\n* [[Steven Anthony Lawrence]] as Ralph\n* Logan McElroy as Fuzzy\n* [[Gus Hoffman]] as Goggles\n* [[Tara Correa-McMullen|Tara Correa]] as Big Mac\n* [[Alia Shawkat]] as Amy\n* [[Amy Bruckner]] as Annie\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Late Carl\n* [[Katt Williams|Katt Micah Williams]] as Preacher Don's sidekick\n* [[Beau Billingslea]] as NCBA board member\n* [[Cody Linley]] as Larry Burgess, Jr.\n* [[Robert Rusler]] as Falcon coach\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Rebound'' received negative reviews from critics.
