It is the sequel to ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994) and stars  [[Sandra Bullock]] (who reprises her role from the original), [[Jason Patric]], and [[Willem Dafoe]]. ''Cruise Control'' tells the story of Annie (Bullock) and Alex (Patric), a couple who go on vacation to the [[Caribbean]] aboard a luxury [[cruise ship]], which is hijacked by a villain named Geiger (Dafoe). As they are trapped aboard the ship, Annie and Alex work with the ship's first officer to try to stop it after they discover it is programmed to crash into an [[oil tanker]].\n\nDe Bont had the idea for the film after he had a recurring nightmare about a cruise ship crashing into an island. ''Speed'' star [[Keanu Reeves]] was initially supposed to reprise his role as Jack Traven for the sequel, but decided not to commit and was replaced by Patric before filming. The writers had to rework the script to accommodate the addition of a new character. Production took place aboard ''[[MV Seabourn Legend|Seabourn Legend]]'', the ship on which the film is set. The final scene, in which the ship crashes into the island of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], cost almost a quarter of the budget, and set records as the largest and most expensive stunt ever filmed. Many interior scenes aboard the ship were shot on [[soundstage]]s in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The soundtrack featured mostly [[reggae]] music. [[Mark Mancina]] returned to compose the [[film score]], released as an album 13 years after the film's release.\n\nThe film was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on June 13, 1997, to negative reviews. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism, as well as the absence of Reeves and its setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, citing it as less thrilling than that of ''Speed'' on a fast-moving bus. Eminent critic [[Roger Ebert]] defended the film, calling it a \"truly rousing ocean liner adventure story\". The film was also a [[box-office bomb]], earning $164 million worldwide against a production budget as high as $160 million. It was nominated for eight [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] category.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAlex Shaw is on a motorcycle chasing a vehicle with stolen goods. After he catches the driver of the vehicle, his girlfriend Annie Porter runs into him during her driving test. She finds out that Alex is on the [[SWAT]] team after he lied and told her that he was a beach officer. As an apology, Alex surprises her with a [[Caribbean]] cruise on ''[[Seabourn Legend]]''.\n\nAboard the ship, deranged passenger John Geiger, a former employee of the cruise company, [[security hacker|hacks]] into the ship's computer system, and the following evening, he sabotages the ship's communication systems and kills Captain Pollard. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] to tell the [[Chief mate|first officer]], Juliano, that Pollard is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, and a group of people become trapped behind locked [[fire door]]s in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]], Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. When the winch lowering the lifeboat jams, Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers, while Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.\n\nAlex realizes that Geiger is controlling the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to the cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw to cut the door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the [[navigator]], Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the [[Ballast tank|ballast]] doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system, and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he contracted copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.\n\nThe crew notice that Geiger has set the ship to crash into an [[oil tanker]] off the coast of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]]. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving underneath it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes that Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.\n\nTo avoid collision with the oil tanker, Alex and Dante go into the ship's [[bilge]] and use the [[bow thruster]]s to turn it. The ship screeches down the side of the tanker, but manages to withstand the damage, and heads straight into a marina. It then crashes into a Saint Martin town and eventually stops. Alex jumps off, hijacks a speed boat, and pursues Geiger to a [[seaplane]].  Alex shoots at it from the boat with a [[speargun]] and reels himself in through the water. He climbs onto the plane, rescues Annie, and both escape from the plane on one of its [[float (nautical)|floats]], which falls onto the ocean. Geiger attempts to fly over the oil tanker, but the plane becomes impaled on the ship's foremast, causing both to explode. The tanker crew however are safe, having launched their lifeboat just in time, leaving Geiger for prey in the ensuing explosion. Annie and Alex travel back to shore in the speed boat, and he gives her an engagement ring, asking her if she will \"wear this for a while\", and she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Annie Porter\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Officer Alex Shaw\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as John Geiger\n\n===''Seabourn Legend'' crew===\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Juliano\n* [[Brian McCardie]] as Merced\n* [[Jeremy Hotz]] as Ashton\n* [[Bo Svenson]] as Captain Pollard\n* Royale Watkins as Dante\n* [[Tamia|Tamia Hill]] as Sheri Silver\n* [[Kimmy Robertson]] as Liza\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Cruise passengers===\n* [[Christine Firkins]] as Drew\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Celeste\n* [[Francis Guinan]] as Rupert\n* [[Mike Hagerty|Michael G.
