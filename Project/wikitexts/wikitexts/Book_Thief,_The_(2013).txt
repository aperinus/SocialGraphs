The film is based on the [[The Book Thief|2005 novel of the same name]] by [[Markus Zusak]] and adapted by [[Michael Petroni]]. The film is about a young girl living with her adoptive German family during the Nazi era. Taught to read by her kind-hearted foster father, the girl begins \"borrowing\" books and sharing them with the Jewish refugee being sheltered by her foster parents in their home. The film features a musical score by Oscar-winning composer [[John Williams]].\n\n''The Book Thief'' premiered at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] on October 3, 2013, and was released for general distribution in the United States on November 8, 2013. The film received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release with some reviewers praising its \"fresher perspective on the war\" and its focus on the \"consistent thread of humanity\" in the story,<ref name=\"nem\" /> with other critics faulting the film's \"wishful narrative\".<ref name=\"latimes\" /> With a budget of $19 million,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Book-Thief-The#tab=summary |title=The Book Thief |work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |date=January 5, 2014 |access-date=January 6, 2014}}</ref> the film was successful at the box office, earning over $76 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url = https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bookthief.htm | title = The Book Thief | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |date = February 6, 2014 | access-date = February 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n''The Book Thief'' received  [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] nominations for its score. For her performance in the film, Sophie N\u00e9lisse won the [[Hollywood Film Festival]] Spotlight Award, the [[Satellite Awards|Satellite]] Newcomer Award, and the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role \u2013 Female.

In one of the opening scenes, twelve-year-old Liesel is travelling with her mother and younger brother on a train. On the way, her brother dies and is buried next to the tracks. Liesel steals her first book, titled ''The Grave Digger's Handbook'', when it falls out of the gravedigger's pocket. Liesel is then brought to her new home in Munich, where she meets her new foster parents Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann. Rudy Steiner, a boy who lives next door, accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant \"dummkopf\" (\"[[dunce]]\") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends. When Hans, her foster father, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside along with a giant chalkboard. Liesel becomes captivated with reading anything she can.\n\nLiesel and Rudy become members of the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth movement]]. While at a [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burning]] ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are harassed by Franz into throwing books onto the bonfire, but Liesel is upset to see the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the [[Burgermeister]] (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor, who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.\n\nDuring [[Kristallnacht]], Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Max's mother forces him to go. Max's father had saved Hans' life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns' house, where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesel's neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and he becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps him recover by reading to him at every spare moment books \"borrowed\" from the mayor's library.\n\nOne day while \"borrowing\" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.\n\nWhile working, Hans sees a neighbour and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.\n\nOn the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.\n\nHans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, Rudy's family and Franz are killed in the blast. Liesel is spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead; she cries and hugs them. Soldiers bring Rudy out of his house alive, but he dies a few moments later after almost telling Liesel he loves her. Liesel begs him to wake up, and kisses him on the lips as a goodbye. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.\n\nTwo years later, after Germany has been [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied]] by the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by late Rudy's father when Max suddenly enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her younger self, upon which the camera lingers. The narrator does not state whom she had married but implies that she became a renowned writer.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File: The Book Thief Interview.jpg|thumb|Left to right: book author [[Markus Zusak]], stars [[Geoffrey Rush]] and [[Sophie N\u00e9lisse]], director [[Brian Percival]], interviewed about ''The Book Thief'' by Selig Film News in 2013.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Hans Hubermann, Liesel's kind-hearted foster father\n* [[Sophie N\u00e9lisse]] as Liesel Meminger, the titular \"book thief\"\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Rosa Hubermann, Liesel's bad-tempered foster mother\n* [[Nico Liersch]] as Rudy Steiner, Liesel's best friend who is in love with her\n* [[Ben Schnetzer]] as Max Vanderburg\n* [[Heike Makatsch]] as Liesel's mother  \n* [[Barbara Auer]] as Ilsa Hermann, the Burgermeister's (mayor's) wife\n* [[Roger Allam]] as Death, the film's narrator\n<!-- per talk page * Joachim Paul Assb\u00f6ck as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer -->\n* Sandra Nedeleff as Sarah\n* Hildegard Schroedter as Frau Becker\n* Rafael Gareisen as Walter Kugler, Max's best friend \n* Gotthard Lange as the gravedigger\n* [[Godehard Giese]] as the policeman on the train\n* [[Oliver Stokowski]] as Alex Steiner, Rudy's father\n* Levin Liam as Franz Deutscher, bully and leader of Rudy's Hitler Youth squad\n* Carina Wiese as Barbara Steiner, Rudy's mother\n* Julian Lehmann as Werner Meminger, Liesel's Brother\n* Martin Ontrop as Herr Lehman, Jewish who got taken away and Hans stood up for\n}}\n\n==Production==\nA search for an actress to play the eponymous book thief, Liesel Meminger, occurred across the world.

It expanded to a wide release on November 27, 2013.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Book Thief'' received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 47%, based on 149 reviews, with an average score of 5.70/10. The site's consensus states, \"A bit too safe in its handling of its Nazi Germany setting, ''The Book Thief'' counters its constraints with a respectful tone and strong performances.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_book_thief/|title=The Book Thief|access-date=May 22, 2020|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-book-thief/|title=The Book Thief|work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nIn her review for the ''New Empress Magazine'', Mair\u00e9ad Roche praised the film for providing a \"fresher perspective on the war\" through the experiences of ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era.<ref name=\"nem\">{{cite web|last=Roche |first=Mair\u00e9ad |title=In Review: The Book Thief |work=New Empress Magazine |date=February 28, 2014 |url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2014/02/in-review-the-book-thief/ |access-date=March 27, 2014}}</ref> In addition to the \"Oscar-baiting beautiful\" cinematography and John Williams's film score that contribute to the film's emotional appeal, Roche singled out the performance of young Sophie N\u00e9lisse as Liesel that \"matches the well-measured and seemingly effortless efforts of both Rush and Watson\".<ref name=\"nem\"/> Roche concluded,\n{{blockquote|''The Book Thief'' weaves a consistent thread of humanity through its narrative via the commonality of Death, storytelling and the concept of free will. The disturbing sight of children in Hitler Youth uniforms and Allied blanket bombing, when shown through the innocence of a child, humanises the German generation just living their lives without the hindsight of history. A blurring of vision due to tears is to be expected, but that effect is delivered with respect and dignity to the audience.<ref name=\"nem\"/>}}\n\nIn his review following the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]], Dennis Harvey at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine wrote, \"Rush generously provides the movie's primary warmth and humor; Watson is pitch-perfect as a seemingly humorless scold with a well-buried soft side.\"<ref name=\"variety\"/> Harvey also praised the film's cinematography and film score, noting that \"impeccable design contributions are highlighted by Florian Ballhaus'[s] somber but handsome widescreen lensing and an excellent score by John Williams that reps his first feature work for a director other than Steven Spielberg in years.\"<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Film Review: 'The Book Thief'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/the-book-thief-review-1200694271|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=February 23, 2014|date=October 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nStephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was less impressed with the film, giving it two and half out of four stars.
