''The Shootist'', New York, New York: Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-06099-8}}</ref> It is [[John Wayne]]'s final film role, before his death in 1979. The screenplay was written by [[Glendon Swarthout#Family|Miles Hood Swarthout]] (the son of the author) and Scott Hale. The supporting cast includes [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Ron Howard]], [[James Stewart]], [[Richard Boone]], [[Hugh O'Brian]], [[Harry Morgan]], [[John Carradine]], [[Sheree North]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Rick Lenz]].\n\nIn 1977, ''The Shootist'' received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] (Robert F. Boyle, Arthur Jeph Parker), a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Award]] nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]] (Lauren Bacall), and a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]] (Ron Howard), as well as the [[National Board of Review]] Award as one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|Top Ten Films of 1976]]. The film received widespread critical acclaim, garnering an 83% positive rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe opening scenes are a narrated flashback of the thirty plus killings by [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]]-turned-[[gunfighter]] John Bernard \"J.B.\" Books, using actual scenes from John Wayne's past films.\n\nNow an older man, Books arrives in [[Carson City]], [[Nevada]], in late January 1901. Almost immediately, he gets into a potentially dangerous confrontation with dairyman Jay Cobb, but his assistant, Gillom Rogers, defuses the situation. Books goes to Dr. E.W. \"Doc\" Hostetler, a country physician who knows Books from treating his gunshot wounds fifteen years before. Books came to seek out Hostetler for a second opinion concerning his failing health. Hostetler confirms that Books has terminal [[cancer]] and has only weeks to live. Books is prescribed [[laudanum]] to ease his pain but learns that his condition will eventually become unbearable. Hostetler remarks that if he had Books's courage, the death he has just described is not the one he would choose.\n\nBooks finds lodgings at a quiet boarding house owned by Bond Rogers, Gillom's widowed mother. Wanting to be left alone, he gives her a fake name. However, Gillom finds Books' initials on his horse's saddle and quickly deduces his true identity. Bond is upset that Books has lied to her about who he is and summons Marshal Walter Thibido; Books gets rid of him by explaining his circumstances and assuring the marshal that he'll be dead soon. Sympathetic to his plight, Bond asks Books to accompany her to church to obtain solace and comfort. However, Books maintains he has no need of repentance, stating that he has never harmed or injured anyone who did not deserve it.\n\nWord spreads that Books is in town, causing him trouble from those seeking to profit off his name or to kill him. A local journalist, Dan Dobkins, gets chased off when he asks Books for an interview. Serepta, an old flame of Books's, shows up; she eventually leaves after admitting that Dobkins approached her about writing a \"[[biography]]\" of Books' life filled with exaggerated stories of his gunfights. Books orders a headstone, but rejects the undertaker's offer of a free funeral, suspecting he would charge the public admission to view his remains. Two criminals seeking notoriety try to ambush Books as he sleeps, but he kills them. Gillom is impressed, but his mother is both angry at and frightened for Books, though she will not admit it. She also grows concerned that the fatherless Gillom will try to follow in his footsteps as the two grow closer, with Books teaching Gillom how to shoot properly.\n\nBooks asks Gillom to visit three men with violent reputations: Mike Sweeney, an aging outlaw and the brother of a man Books once killed in self-defense; Jack Pulford, the [[Faro (card game)|Faro]] dealer at the local Metropole saloon, known to be a deadly crack shot; and Cobb, Gillom's boss. He is to tell each of them that Books will be at the Metropole at 11:00 am on January 29, his birthday. On the morning of January 29, the headstone arrives, which includes Books' death year as \"1901\", but with no day. Books gives Gillom his beloved horse, bids farewell to Bond, and then boards a trolley for the saloon.\n\nBooks enters the saloon to find the three men waiting for him at different tables. Books orders a drink, toasting his birthday and his three \"guests\". Cobb, Sweeney, and Pulford each try to kill Books, but despite getting wounded in the arm, he manages to kill them. A crowd fills the street outside the Metropole after hearing the gunshots, including Gillom, who eventually enters the bar. His shouted warning is too late, and the Metropole's bartender fires his [[shotgun]] into Books' back, mortally wounding him. Gillom rushes over, takes up Books' gun, and kills the bartender. When Gillom realizes what he has done and throws the gun away, Books smiles in approval before passing away. Gillom covers the body with his coat and walks outside to his waiting mother. He walks past her, and she turns and follows him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Wayne]] as J.B.

Although his compromised lung capacity made breathing and mobility difficult at Carson City's {{convert|4600|foot|adj=on|abbr=on}} altitude, and production had to be shut down for a week while he recovered from influenza, Wayne completed the filming without further significant medical issues.<ref>Shepherd D, Slatzer R, Grayson D.

Wayne was not, as sometimes reported, terminally ill when the film was made in 1976. A heavy cigarette smoker for most of his life, he had been diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1964 and underwent surgical removal of his [[pneumonectomy|left lung]] and several ribs. He remained clinically cancer-free until early 1979, when [[Metastasis|metastases]] were discovered in his stomach, intestines, and spine; he died in June of that year.<ref>Bacon, J.

''The Shootist'' was shot in 1976 while ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' was shot in 1946 (albeit released in 1948), putting the two movies thirty years apart. The onscreen dates were also thirty years apart, 1871 for the ''Red River'' clip and 1901 for the time frame of ''The Shootist'' itself. The other films used for clips were ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' dated 1880, ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' dated 1885, and two clips from ''[[El Dorado  (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' dated 1889 and 1895.\n\nThe film's outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Carson City. Bond Rogers' boarding house is the 1914 Krebs-Peterson House, located in Carson City's historic residential district. The buggy ride was shot at [[Washoe Lake State Park]], in the [[Washoe Valley (Nevada)|Washoe Valley]], between [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and Carson City. Though it was a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] production, the street scenes and most interior shots were filmed at the [[Warner Bros.]] backlot and sound stages in [[Burbank, California]].<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/Shootist.html#.V8WSbBRGWA0 ''The Shootist'' locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819022226/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/Shootist.html#.V8WSbBRGWA0 |date=August 19, 2016 }}. movie-locations.com, retrieved August 30, 2016.</ref>  The horse-drawn trolley was an authentic one, once used as a shuttle between El Paso and [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez|Juarez, Mexico]].<ref>Shepherd, Slatzer, & Grayson (2002), pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nWayne's contract gave him script approval, and he made a number of major and minor changes, including the location (from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to Carson City),<ref name=\"Shepherd, Slatzer 2002 p. 298\">Shepherd, Slatzer, & Grayson (2002), p. 298</ref> and the ending. In the book and original screenplay, Books kills his last opponent by shooting him in the back, is fatally wounded by a bartender with a shotgun, and is finally put out of his misery by Gillom; Wayne maintained that over his entire film career, he had never shot an adversary in the back and would not do so now. He also objected to his character being killed by Gillom and suggested that the bartender do it, because \"no one could ever take John Wayne in a fair fight\".<ref>Hyams, J. ''The Life and Times of the Western Movie''. Gallery Books (1984), pp. 214-5. {{ISBN|0831755458}}</ref> \n \nWayne was also responsible for many casting decisions. Several friends and past co-stars, including Bacall, Stewart, Boone, and Carradine, were cast at his request. James Stewart had not worked in films for a number of years, due in part to a severe hearing impairment, but he accepted the role as a favor to Wayne. Stewart and Wayne had both worked in two previous films, also Westerns, ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' and ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'', both released in 1962, although they shared no scenes together in the latter film.\n\nWhile filming the sequence in the doctor's office, both Stewart and Wayne repeatedly muffed their lines over a long series of takes, until director Don Siegel finally pleaded with them to try harder. \"If you want the scene done better,\" joked Wayne, \"you'd better get yourself a couple of better actors.\" Later, Wayne commented in private that Stewart knew his lines, but apparently could not hear his cues.<ref>Shepherd, Slatzer, & Grayson (2002), p. 301.</ref>\n\nAnother casting stipulation was the horse owned and given away by Wayne's character, a favorite [[Sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] [[gelding]] named Dollor that Wayne had ridden in ''[[Big Jake]]'', ''[[The Cowboys]]'', ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'', ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]'', ''[[Chisum]]'', and ''[[The Train Robbers]]''.  Wayne had negotiated exclusive movie rights to Dollor with the horse's owner, Dick Webb Movie Productions, and requested script changes enabling him to mention Dollor's name several times.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-13/features/8501030451_1_john-wayne-horse-cowboy Texas Couple Tend John Wayne's Horse To See That Fans Get Dollor's Worth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041042/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-01-13/features/8501030451_1_john-wayne-horse-cowboy |date=June 11, 2016 }}.
