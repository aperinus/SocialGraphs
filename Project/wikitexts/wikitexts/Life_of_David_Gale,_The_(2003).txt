The film is an [[international co-production]], between [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]] and [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]]. It was Parker's final film before his retirement.\n\n[[Kevin Spacey]] plays the eponymous character, a college professor and longtime activist against [[capital punishment]] who is sentenced to death for killing a fellow capital punishment opponent; [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Laura Linney]] co-star. The film was released February 21, 2003. It received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed just $38.9 million against its $38 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\nDavid Gale is a former professor on death row in Texas. With only a few days until his execution, his lawyer negotiates a half-million dollar fee to tell his story to Bitsey Bloom, a journalist from a major news network. She has a reputation of keeping secrets and protecting her sources. He tells her his story revealed through a series of flashbacks.\n\nIn 1995, Gale is a successful intellectual and the head of the philosophy department at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He is an active member of DeathWatch, an advocacy group campaigning against capital punishment. At a graduation party, he encounters Berlin, a graduate student who has been expelled from the school. When Gale gets drunk, she seduces him and they have rough sex. She then falsely accuses Gale of rape. The next day, he loses a televised debate with the Governor of Texas when he is unable to name any innocent people executed during the governor's term. Gale is arrested, but the charge is dropped when Berlin disappears. However, his marriage, career, and reputation are all destroyed. Gale struggles with alcoholism after his wife takes their son with her to Spain and disallows contact.\n\nConstance Harraway, a fellow DeathWatch activist, is a close friend of Gale who consoles him after his life falls apart. However, Harraway is discovered raped and murdered, suffocated by a plastic bag taped over her head. An autopsy reveals Gale's semen in her body and that she had been forced to swallow the key to the handcuffs, a torture technique which Gale previously wrote about. The physical evidence at the crime scene points to Gale, who is convicted of rape and murder and is sentenced to death.\n\nIn the present, Bloom investigates the case in between her visits with Gale. Gale maintains his innocence, claiming he and Harraway had consensual sex the night before her murder. Bloom comes to believe that the apparent evidence against Gale does not add up. She is tailed several times in her car by Dusty Wright, an alleged one-time lover and colleague of Harraway, whom she suspects was the real killer. Wright slips evidence to Bloom that suggests Gale has been framed, implying that the actual murderer videotaped the crime. Bloom pursues this lead until she finds a tape revealing that Harraway, who was suffering from terminal [[leukemia]], had committed an elaborate suicide made to look like murder. Wright is seen on the videotape, acting as her accomplice, implying that they framed Gale as part of a plan to discredit the death penalty by conspiring to execute an innocent person, and subsequently releasing evidence of the actual circumstances.\n\nOnce Bloom and her aide find this evidence, only hours remain until Gale's scheduled execution. She tries to give the tape to the authorities in time to stop the execution. She arrives at the [[Huntsville Unit]] just as the warden announces that the execution has been carried out. The tape is subsequently released, causing a media and political uproar over the execution of an innocent man. Later, Wright receives the money that Bloom's magazine agreed to pay for the interview, and delivers it to Gale's ex-wife, along with a postcard from Berlin confessing that the rape accusation that derailed Gale's life and career was false. His ex-wife looks distraught, knowing Gale told the truth and that she effectively stole their child away from him.\n\nLater, a videotape labeled \"Off the Record\" is delivered to Bloom. This tape shows Harraway's suicide and Gale deliberately leaving his fingerprints on the plastic bag in the process. He then looks at the camera and ends the recording, leaving Bloom stunned with the truth that the couple deliberately sacrificed themselves to discredit capital punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as David Gale\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Bitsey Bloom\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Constance Harraway\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Zack Stemmons\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Berlin\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Braxton Belyeu\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Dusty Wright\n* [[Jim Beaver]] as Duke Grover\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Nico\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Life of David Gale'' was shot in multiple places, including several notable locations in [[Austin]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huntsville, Texas]], such as [[Sam Houston State University]], [[Ellis Unit]], [[The University of Texas at Austin]], and [[Pla\u00e7a Reial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/011116/laf055_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011119073807/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/011116/laf055_1.html|title=Universal Pictures' 'The Life of David Gale,' Directed by Alan Parker and Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet And Laura Linney, Begins Principal Photography in Texas|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=[[Cision]]|via=[[Yahoo!
