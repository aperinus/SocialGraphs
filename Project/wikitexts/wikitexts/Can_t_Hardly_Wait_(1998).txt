It stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Ethan Embry]], [[Charlie Korsmo]], [[Lauren Ambrose]], [[Peter Facinelli]], [[Seth Green]], and [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], and is notable for a number of \"before-they-were-famous\" appearances by teen stars. The story takes place at a high school graduation party in the 1990s.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed a total of $25 million at the North American domestic box office, against a production budget of $10 million. The soundtrack peaked at number 25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.\n\n==Concept==\nThe story takes place at a [[secondary school|high school]] graduation party in the late 1990s and in a style much like that of the high school movies of the 1980s. The idea of setting most of the movie at a party was based primarily on concerns to keep production costs low and was also inspired by the movies of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and the party scene in [[Say Anything]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://entertainment.time.com/2013/06/12/back-to-the-party-15-things-you-didnt-know-about-cant-hardly-wait/ |title=Back to the Party: 15 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Can\u2019t Hardly Wait |author=Lily Rothman |date=2013-06-12 |access-date=2022-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/6/11/17442324/cant-hardly-wait-20th-anniversary |title=The Beer Has Not Gone Bad: How \u2018Can\u2019t Hardly Wait\u2019 Became a Teen Cult Classic |author=Andrew Gruttadaro |date=2018-06-11 |work=The Ringer |access-date=2022-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThe film takes its name from [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]' song of the same title, from their 1987 album ''[[Pleased to Meet Me]]'', which plays over the film's closing credits.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1998, the senior class of a suburban high school, Huntington Hillside High, are attending a [[graduation]] party at a large house owned by a rich class member's family. Among them are Preston Meyers, a typical outsider who plans to proclaim his love to his four-year secret [[limerence|crush]] Amanda Beckett. Amanda, the most popular girl in school and the senior class prom queen, has recently been dumped by her popular [[jock (subculture)|jock]] boyfriend Mike Dexter. Mike is targeted by [[nerd]] classmate William Lichter, who is plotting revenge against him for years of relentless [[bullying]]. Preston's antisocial best friend Denise Fleming has no intention of going to the party, but is dragged along by Preston. Kenny Fisher is a wannabe thug who plans on losing his [[virginity]] by the end of the night.\n\nAmanda is consoled by her popular girlfriends, whom she realizes she has nothing in common with, and her own second-cousin, who tries to hit on her. She tries to figure out if she has an identity beyond only being known as \"Mike Dexter's girlfriend\". She discovers a letter addressed to her by Preston and, moved by its contents, makes it her mission to find him, but she doesn't know what he looks like and no one she asks gives any helpful descriptions. Meanwhile, Denise and Kenny wind up locking themselves inside an upstairs bathroom away from the party by accident, where they talk about their old friendship and how they had drifted apart; their conversation leads to the restoration of their friendship and escalates into them having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].\n\nLater, an intoxicated Mike learns from Trip McNeely\u2014a graduate and former stud from his high school\u2014that in college, guys like them are \"a dime a dozen\". Trip emphasizes how he dumped his girlfriend in the same fashion that Mike did to \"score\" with other women and was unsuccessful. Terrified of this prospect, Mike tries to get Amanda back, but she is happier without him and humiliates him in front of everyone at the party. After seeing the school jock turned down, multiple men begin to hit on her, much to her disgust. Preston finds Amanda and confesses his love, but since she still hasn't learned what he looks like, she assumes he is another pervert and rejects him in front of the entire party as well. She later realizes her mistake when she sees Preston's yearbook picture and tries to find him, but he has already driven home in disappointment.\n\nAt the same time, William devises his plan to get revenge on Mike and goes into the party to drive Mike out. While inside the party, William begins drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to fit in, and drinks enough to make him forget the entire reason he was there. An impromptu sing-along to [[Guns N' Roses]]' \"[[Paradise City]]\" causes him to become popular, with multiple women trying desperately to have sex with him. Soon after, William begins talking with Mike, who apologizes for bullying him. William forgives him; the two bond and seemingly become friends. When Mike and William are jailed as a result of a police bust, Mike takes the blame.\n\nThe next morning, when William sees Mike and his friends at a diner, he tries to thank Mike for taking the fall. But Mike acts as though he remembers nothing that happened the previous night and ridicules William in front of his friends. Meanwhile, Preston is at a [[train station]] about to leave for Boston when Amanda arrives and asks him about the letter. Preston confesses he wrote it and is about to depart for a writing workshop with [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. The two say goodbye and Preston walks away, but he then stops and runs back to Amanda and they share a kiss.\n\nThe epilogue explains what happened to all of the main characters:\n* William became one of the most popular students at Harvard. He formed his own computer company that has made him worth millions, and he has been dating a supermodel.\n* Mike went to college but, after drinking too much, lost his football scholarship. He ended up forty pounds overweight and working at a car wash, a job he lost when incriminating Polaroids surfaced.\n* The day after the party, Denise and Kenny went to a diner; five minutes later, Denise dumped Kenny. Ten minutes later, they found a bathroom and got back together.\n* Seven hours later, Preston finally boarded a train to Boston. Amanda wrote him a letter for every day that he was away. They are still together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Preston Meyers\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as Amanda Beckett\n* [[Lauren Ambrose]] as Denise Fleming\n* [[Peter Facinelli]] as Mike Dexter\n* [[Seth Green]] as Kenny Fisher\n* [[Charlie Korsmo]] as William Lichter\n* [[Robert Jayne]] as Richie Coolboy\n* Michelle Brookhurst as Molly Stinson, party host\n* [[Joel Michaely]] as Geoff Piccirilli, X-File #1\n* [[Jay Paulson]] as Murphy Pelan, X-File #2\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as the [[Kleptomaniac|Klepto]] Kid\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Matt, Watermelon Guy\n* [[Clea DuVall|Clea Duvall]] as Jana\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Beth, Girlfriend #1\n* [[Tamala Jones]] as Cindi, Girlfriend #2\n* Jennifer Lyons as Rachel, Girlfriend #3\n* [[Channon Roe]] as Jake, Jock #1\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Ben, Jock #2\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as T.J., Jock #3\n* [[Erik Palladino]] as Cousin Ron\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Dan, Love Burger drummer\n* [[Paige Moss]] as Ashley\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Steve, Hippie Guy\n* [[Selma Blair]] and [[Jennifer Paz]] as the Girls Mike Hits On\n* [[Sara Rue]] as Earth Girl\n* [[Nicole Bilderback]] as Ready to Have Sex Girl\n* [[Leslie Grossman]] as Ready to Have Sex's Friend\n* [[Marisol Nichols]] as Groupie #2\n* [[Vicellous Reon Shannon|Vicellous Shannon]] as Carl, [[Reddi-wip]] Kid\n\n===Uncredited appearances===\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as the angel stripper\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Trip McNeely\n* [[Melissa Joan Hart]] as Vicki, the yearbook girl\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Walter, Love Burger lead singer\n* [[Deborah Kaplan]] and [[Harry Elfont]] as voices of graduation students\n* [[Amber Benson]] as Stephanie, the stoned girl\n* [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] as Mary, the crying drunk girl\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe script for ''Can't Hardly Wait'' was originally written in 1996, by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan who were looking for a project they could develop and direct themselves on a limited budget.
