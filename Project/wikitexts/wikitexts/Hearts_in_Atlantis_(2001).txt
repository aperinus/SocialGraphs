It is loosely adapted from [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' tie-in ''[[Low Men in Yellow Coats]]'', a novella in the 1999 collection ''[[Hearts in Atlantis]]'' after which the film was named.\n\nThe film is dedicated to cinematographer [[Piotr Soboci\u0144ski]], who died of a heart attack a few months before the release.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle-aged photographer and businessman Robert \"Bobby\" Garfield returns to his old hometown upon learning that his best friend, decorated soldier John \"Sully\" Sullivan, has died in a traffic accident and begins recollecting his past when he visits an abandoned house where he used to live. During a summer in the 1960s, an eleven-year old Bobby lives with his widowed mother, self-centered Liz Garfield, and has two friends, Carol Gerber and Sully. They experienced many things together, the most mysterious of which was meeting an older gentleman named [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Ted Brautigan]], whom Liz takes in as a boarder.\n\nTed takes the lonely Bobby under his wing, while his mother is busy with her job. The two form a father-son bond, and it slowly becomes evident that Ted has some psychic and [[Telekinesis|telekinetic powers]], which are the reason he has come to this sleepy town. In due course Ted explains that he has escaped the grasp of the \"Low Men\", strange people who would stop at nothing to get him back in their control.\n\nAfter reading Bobby's mind and realizing that the boy dreams of owning a bicycle, Ted kindly offers Bobby $1 a week in exchange for his reading a newspaper out loud. Bobby quickly figures out that Ted has some other purpose in mind. Mysteriously, Ted asks Bobby to keep an eye on the neighborhood looking for any signs of the \"low men\", like announcements about missing pets. Bobby sees one, but does not tell Ted, afraid to lose his new friend.\n\nBobby, Carol and John have frequent conflicts with the local town bully, Harry Doolin, whom Ted scares away by looking into his mind and finding out that his violence is used to cover up his secret [[cross-dressing]]. However, at one point, Harry harasses and injures Carol, and when Ted manipulates her dislocated shoulder into place, Liz arrives, after being raped by her boss, and mistakenly believes that Ted is a [[Child molestation|child molester]]. She is confronted by Ted's ability to tell her the truth about what she has been through, and how her behavior is affecting her relationship with her son, providing another reason that Ted must leave. \n \nTed is eventually captured with the help of a tip from Liz. As some form of closure, Ted yells to Bobby as he is being driven away that he wouldn't have missed a moment \"not for all the world\", and later Bobby mirrors the same feelings. Bobby is later confronted by Harry but Bobby grabs the latter's baseball bat and beats him with it. Liz finds a new job in Boston and moves the family there. Before he leaves, Bobby and Carol say their goodbyes and share a final kiss.\n\nReturning to the present, Bobby turns to leave his old home wherein he meets a young girl named Molly. The two strike up a conversation wherein Molly reveals that she is Carol's daughter and that Carol died in recent years. Bobby gives Molly a photograph of a young Carol and the two become friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[List of characters from the Dark Tower series#Ted Brautigan|Ted Brautigan]]\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Garfield \n** [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Adult Robert \"Bobby\" Garfield \n* [[Hope Davis]] as Elizabeth \"Liz\" Garfield\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Carol Gerber \n** Boorem also plays Molly, Carol's daughter, whom the adult Bobby meets in the present.\n* [[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]] as Mrs. Gerber\n* [[Will Rothhaar]] as John \"Sully\" Sullivan\n* [[Timothy Reifsnyder (actor)|Timmy Reifsnyder]] as Harry Doolin\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Monte Man\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Len Files\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Alana Files\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Don Biderman\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Hearts in Atlantis'' opened at #3 raking in $9,021,494 in its opening weekend at the U.S. box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2001&wknd=39&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for September 28-30, 2001 - Box Office Mojo|website=Boxofficemojo.com|access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> The film would eventually gross a domestic total of $24,185,781, somewhat short of its $31 million budget, but with an international $6,733,634, it would total $30,919,415.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=heartsinatlantis.htm |title= Hearts in Atlantis (2001) | work = [[Box Office Mojo]]  |access-date= November 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\n''Hearts in Atlantis'' received mixed reviews.
