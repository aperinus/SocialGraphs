It opened on 10 June 2011 in the US<ref name=\"fji\"/> to a mostly positive critical reception.<ref name=\"Rotten\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nA group of students from [[Volda University College]], Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna M\u00f8rck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans ([[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen ([[Hans Morten Hansen]]), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and reveals that he was bitten by something. They escape in Hans's [[Land Rover]] and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that it is not bears he is hunting, but [[troll]]s. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do exactly as he instructs.\n\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and asks if any of them believe in [[God]] or [[Jesus]], because a troll can smell a [[Christians|Christian]] man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful [[Ultraviolet|UV-rays]] to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\" depending on how old they are. The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll (called a Tusseladd). Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to determine why.\n\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll (Raglefant) and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of cave trolls (Dovregubbens). The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation becomes more tense when Kalle confesses that he is, in fact, a Christian. The trolls pick up Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic, the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is caught and killed before he can escape.\n\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a [[Muslim]]; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a [[J\u00f6tunn|Jotnar]], a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for [[rabies]], meaning Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\n\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. Before doing so, he directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his TSS agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and collapses at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black, a truck is seen coming down the road towards the camera. An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice.<ref name=\"Eggertson\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/24457/interview-andre-ovredal-director-of-trollhunter |title=Interview: Andre Ovredal, Director of 'TrollHunter'!! |first=Chris |last=Eggertsen |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]] as Hans the trollhunter\n* [[Hans Morten Hansen]] as Finn\n* Tomas Alf Larsen as Kalle\n* Johanna M\u00f8rck as Johanna\n* [[Knut N\u00e6rum]] as a power company manager\n* [[Robert Stoltenberg]] as a Polish bear hunter\n* Glenn Erland Tosterud as Thomas\n* Urmila Berg-Domaas as Malica\n* Torunn L\u00f8demel Stokkeland as Hilda, a veterinarian\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in the forests and mountains of [[Western Norway]], and actress Johanna M\u00f8rck called it an exhausting experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article5363731.ece |title=Som et eventyr \u00e5 v\u00e6re med p\u00e5 |last=\u00d8deg\u00e5rd |first=Espen |work=[[Ringerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> According to director Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal, the team tried to maintain maximum secrecy around the project.

The latter song's quiet, downbeat ending is abruptly followed by a VFX clip, showing the family of \"Mountain King\" trolls (the third of four troll types depicted in the movie) clawing and shrieking at the camera.

The most well-known is probably the Mountain King, which is mentioned in the play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[In the Hall of the Mountain King|its music]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, ''Dovregubbe'', is a compound word whose first part is used in the name for the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] where the characters meet the final troll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Found Footage Horror Films : Fear and the Appearance of Reality |publisher=McFarland & Company |last=Heller-Nicholas |first=Alexandra |year=2014 |page=188 |isbn=9781476613215 }}</ref>\n\nOther common [[Troll#Scandinavian folklore|troll descriptions]] from Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/294439003 |title=Trolls in Film: Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Bann |first1=Jenny |last2=Weinstock |first2=Jeffrey Andrew |year=2014 |page=548 |isbn=9781409425632 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Gothic Topographies: Language, Nation Building and 'Race' |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Leffler |first1=Yvonne |editor-last1=Savolainen |editor-first1=Matti |editor-last2=Mehtonen |editor-first2=P.

For example [[The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll]] when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]] when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale [[Soria Moria Castle]] is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood. A painting by [[Theodor Kittelsen]] based on the same fairy tale is also used as a backdrop on one of the trips they do in the film (Thomas stands in the same pose and asks his friends \"Do I look like that famous painting?\"). The look of the trolls in the film is also influenced by painters like Theodor Kittelsen and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/5799118/know-your-trolls-a-guide-to-troll-science-from-the-director-of-troll-hunter |title=Know Your Trolls: A guide to troll science from the director of TrollHunter |last=Woerner |first=Meredith |publisher=io9 |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs reflected by how the students answer Hans, only a fraction of Norwegians consider themselves religious or visit the church regularly,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/nsd/nsdnytt/06-1/2.html |title=F\u00e5 nordmenn i kirken, men ikke f\u00e6rre enn f\u00f8r |last=Mykkeltvedt |first=Alette Gilhus |publisher=Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste |language=Norwegian |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> even though the majority of Norwegians are members of [[Church of Norway|the state church]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/07/02/10/kirke_kostra_en |title=Church of Norway, 2012 |publisher=Statistisk Sentralbyr\u00e5 |date=19 June 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film also makes references to the often heated conflict between farmers and predators eating their livestock and the farmers' limited ability to react without breaking Norwegian wild life regulations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationen.no/2011/10/27/rovdyr/ove_ommundsen/norsk_sau_og_geit/ulv/sau/7012801 |title=Norsk Sau og Geit er skeptisk til rovdyrtapstall for sau |last=B\u00e5rdsg\u00e5rd |first=Hans |work=Nationen |language=Norwegian |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Similarly there are conflicts that arise when new power lines need to be passed through the landscape.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.7689888 |title=Kampen fortsetter i Hardanger |work=NRK |language=Norwegian |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith several of the cast being comedians that are fairly well-known to the Norwegian audience, including Otto Jespersen playing Hans, it also sets the tone of the film for many.
