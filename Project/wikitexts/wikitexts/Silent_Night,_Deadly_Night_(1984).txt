Sellier, Jr.]], and starring [[Robert Brian Wilson]], [[Lilyan Chauvin]], [[Gilmer McCormick]], Toni Nero, [[Linnea Quigley]], [[Britt Leach]], and Leo Geter. The story concerns a young man named Billy, who suffers from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]] over witnessing his parents' murder on [[Christmas Eve]] by a man disguised as [[Santa Claus]] and his subsequent upbringing in an abusive [[Catholic]]  orphanage. In adulthood, the Christmas holiday leads him into a psychological breakdown, and he emerges as a [[spree killer]] donning a [[Santa suit]].\n\nThe film was released by [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] on November 9, 1984, where it received substantial controversy over its promotional material and content, which featured a killer Santa Claus. In addition to receiving negative reviews, it was pulled from theaters a week after its release. However, it was a success during its opening week, grossing $2.5 million on a budget of $750,000. Since its release, it has developed a [[cult following]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flavorwire.com/493459/so-bad-its-good-its-christmas-time-and-garbage-day-in-silent-night-deadly-night-part-2|title=Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2: So Bad It's Good |publisher=Flavorwire|access-date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> and spawned a [[Silent Night, Deadly Night (film series)|series]], consisting of four sequels, with the fourth and fifth installments having no connection to the original film, as well as a [[Silent Night (2012 film)|loose remake]] in 2012. A reboot is planned for a 2022 release.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1971, 5-year-old [[Billy Chapman (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Billy Chapman]] and his family visit a nursing home in [[Utah]] where his catatonic grandfather stays. When Billy's parents leave the room, his grandfather suddenly awakens and tells Billy to fear [[Santa Claus]], as he punishes the naughty.\n\nOn the way back home, a criminal dressed in a Santa suit \u2013 who had just robbed a liquor store and killed the owner \u2013 attempts to carjack the family. As Billy's father tries to drive away, the criminal shoots him dead and then sexually assaults Billy's mother before slashing her throat with a [[switchblade]]. Billy flees and hides, leaving his baby brother Ricky in the car.\n\nThree years later, in December 1974, 8-year-old Billy and 4-year-old Ricky are celebrating [[Christmas]] in an orphanage run by [[Abbess|Mother Superior]], a strict [[disciplinarian]] who [[corporal punishment|beats]] children who misbehave and considers punishment to be a \"good\" thing. Sister Margaret, who sympathizes with the children, tries to help Billy but he is regularly punished. On Christmas, the orphanage invites a man in a Santa Claus suit to visit the children; Billy, forced to sit on his lap by Mother Superior, punches the man before fleeing to his room in horror.\n\n10 years later, in the spring of 1984, Billy turns 18, leaves the orphanage for a normal life, and obtains a job as a stock boy at a local toy store, with support from Sister Margaret. At the store, he develops a crush on his co-worker Pamela; he has sexual thoughts which are often interrupted by morbid visions of his parents' murders. On [[Christmas Eve]], the employee who plays the store's Santa Claus is injured and Billy's boss Mr. Sims makes him take his place. After the store closes, the staff has a Christmas Eve party. Billy, still in a Santa Claus suit, tries to have a good time, but keeps having memories of his parents' murders, causing him to feel depressed. He sees his co-worker Andy making out with Pamela and they walk into the back room. Billy walks after them and sees Andy trying to rape Pamela. This triggers his insanity; he hangs Andy with a string of Christmas lights and, uttering that punishment is \"good\", murders Pamela with a [[box cutter]].\n\nNext, Billy murders Mr. Sims and his manager Mrs. Randall. Sister Margaret discovers the carnage and returns to the orphanage to seek help. Billy breaks into a nearby house where a young couple named Denise and Tommy are having sex and a little girl named Cindy is sleeping; he impales Denise on a set of deer antlers and throws Tommy through a window. When this awakens Cindy, Billy asks if she has been nice or naughty; she says nice, and he gives her the box cutter he had used earlier. After this, he witnesses bullies picking on two teenage boys and stealing their sleds, and decapitates one of the bullies with his axe.\n\nThe next morning, the orphanage is secured with Officer Barnes and Captain Richards and aided by Sister Margaret, who knows that Billy has committed the murders. The deaf pastor, Father O'Brien, who was dressed in a Santa outfit, is shot by Barnes, who mistook him for Billy. As Barnes continues patrolling the area, he is struck in the chest by Billy's axe. Billy confronts Mother Superior, now in a wheelchair. She taunts Billy due to her disbelief in Santa Claus and just as he prepares to kill her, Richards shoots him in the back. Billy drops to the floor, then utters to the children \"You're safe now, Santa Claus is gone\", before dying from his injuries. A 14-year-old Ricky, coldly staring at Mother Superior, utters \"Naughty.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Robert Brian Wilson]] as [[Billy Chapman (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Billy Chapman]] Age 18\n** Danny Wagner as Eight-Year-Old Billy Chapman\n** Jonathan Best as Five-Year-Old Billy Chapman\n* Alex Burton as Ricky Chapman Age 14\n** Max Broadhead as Four-Year-Old Ricky Chapman\n** Melissa Best as Infant Ricky Chapman\n* [[Lilyan Chauvin]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Gilmer McCormick]] as Sister Margaret\n* Toni Nero as Pamela\n* [[Britt Leach]] as Mr. Sims\n* [[Nancy Borgenicht]] as Mrs. Helen Randall\n* H.E.D.

Schiend who at the time, accepted screenplay ideas in submissions from the public. One of these was a short story entitled '''''He Sees You When You're Sleeping''''' written by a [[Harvard University]] student named Paul Caimi. The story was about a killer [[Santa Claus]] and Schiend was impressed with the concept even though he disliked [[slasher films]]. He then contacted writer Michael Hickey and requested him to write a screenplay based on the short story in which he agreed. Afterwards, Hickey sent the screenplay to [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] who were pleased with it and agreed to finance and distribute the film.\n\nThe film's working title during production was '''''Slayride''''' and it was to be produced by Slayride Productions Inc. Producer Ira Richard Barmak was recruited by Tri-Star to produce the film. Executive producers, Scott J. Schiend and Dennis Whitehead were hoping to hire a new and young director who would be the \"next [[John Carpenter]]\" and considered [[Sam Raimi]], [[Albert Magnoli]], and [[Ken Kwapis]] for the position. Tri-Star expressed interests in television producer [[Charles E. Sellier Jr.]] who was well known for producing the ''[[Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'' motion picture and TV series. Schiend and Whitehead disagreed believing that a veteran producer would not give the film a good look and reputation; however, Tri-Star insisted and eventually hired Sellier for the position.\n\n[[Principal photography]] lasted from March to April 1983 and was shot on location in Herber City and [[Midway, Utah]]. At the time, most of the snow was beginning to melt, so the production crew raced to shoot all exterior shots first. Numerous buildings were used for the interior scenes during filming. The orphanage building was an abandoned school house that was renovated by the crew during production. It was then demolished not long after filming concluded. The Ira's Toys building was a vacant building that was rented out by the crew. As of 2022, it still stands and is currently a [[gym]]. During filming, director Charles E. Sellier Jr. was too uncomfortable with shooting the murder sequences and this resulted in editor Michael Spence to come in as the stand-in director for these scenes.\n\nThe film's cast mainly consisted of local actors in the state of [[Utah]]. Lead star Robert Brian Wilson (Billy at age 18) was at the time living in [[Salt Lake City]] and had no acting experience. He auditioned for his role as the request of his girlfriend. No major and well-known actors were featured in the film and many mostly had experience in only television acting roles.\n\nDuring [[post-production]], TriStar had decided to change the '''''Slayride''''' title of the film to '''''Silent Night, Deadly Night'''''. Music composer Perry Botkin was hired to compose the musical score; he did so by watching a [[betamax]] copy of the film while composing the score as it played. Afterwards, TriSrar hired graphic designer Burt Kleeger to create the infamous theatrical release poster that depicted Santa Claus climbing down a chimney while holding a double-bit [[axe]] that also included the film's tagline: \"You've made it through Halloween, now try and survive Christmas\" along with \"He knows when you've been naughty\".\n\nBecause the film's concept was done before in the 1980 horror film ''[[Christmas Evil]]'' as well as the first segment of the 1972 horror anthology film, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (film)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', the producers and TriStar were not concerned about the killer Santa Claus theme being controversial. However, there was concern that the portrayal of the [[Catholic Church]] in the film would be. Because of this, TriStar agreed to distribute the film in a limited release in the mostly [[protestant]] midwestern United States before moving forward with releasing it in the dominantly [[catholic]] northeastern United States. TriStar set the film's theatrical release date as November 9, 1984, around the start of the [[Christmas season]]. Robert Brian Wilson expressed dissatisfaction with this decision, believing that the film should have been released around [[Halloween]] to avoid less controversy.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released theatrically by [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] on November 9, 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/49516/six-slays-christmas-day-five|title=The Six Slays of Christmas - Day Five|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|access-date=December 23, 2012}}</ref> opening in 398 theaters in the [[Midwest]] United States.<ref name=hysteria>{{cite web|url=https://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/silent_night_deadly_night/|work=Hysteria Lives!|title=Ho-Ho-HOMICIDE: The Silent Night, Deadly Night Controversy|author=Kerswell, J.A.|access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref> On its opening weekend, the film finished eighth, grossing $1,432,800.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=November 13, 1984|title='Oh, God!

Television advertisements, which aired between episodes of family-friendly series such as ''[[Three's Company]]'' and ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', led to parents complaining that their children were terrified of Santa Claus.<ref name=hysteria/> Large crowds (mostly angry families) formed at theaters and malls around the nation to protest the film; at the film's East Coast premiere at the Interboro Quad Theater in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]], protesters picketed the theater and sang [[Christmas carols]] in protest.{{Sfn|Muir|2012|p=412}} \n{{quote box|width=28%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=\"Most protests were generated by the feeling that the depiction of a killer in a Santa Claus suit would traumatize children and undermine their traditional trust in Santa Claus.\"|source=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' editorial, November 1984.<ref name=hysteria/>}}\nIn response, [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]], the film's original distributor, pulled all ads for the film six days after its release on November 15, 1984.<ref name=hysteria/> The film itself was also withdrawn shortly thereafter, due to the controversy.<ref name=\"RiseFallSlasher\">{{cite video|people=Unknown|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film|medium=DVD (Region 1)|location=United States|publisher=THINKfilm|date=2006}}</ref> In response to the public outcry, producer Ira Barmak told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine: \"People have taken offense at Santa being used in a scary context...

The print ad material also replaced the original 'Chimney' picture with one that talked about the controversy.

When released to theatres, Tri-Star originally made these cuts, but when released on home video, the film was unrated. The film was sourced from another master copy containing these scenes. The Theatrical R-rated version never received a home video release until December 4, 2017. Due to the film having these scenes missing from other master copies, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] DVD and Blu-ray releases were released as composite cuts. In hopes that [[Shout! Factory]] would find uncut footage from the original negatives, their search was unsuccessful. According to them, Tri-Star edited out all uncut footage from all their negatives.\n\nThe following edits were made in the R-rated version:\n\n* A shot of Billy being slashed by Santa in his nightmare is removed.\n* After Sims asks Billy what Santa does, it cuts immediately to Andy and Pamela going into the stock room.\n* Sims and Randall singing carols has been entirely redone.\n* Billy's flashback has been edited.\n* Footage of Billy killing Pamela is edited.\n* Randall's death is edited.\n* The deer impalement scene is shortened.\n* The sledding decapitation scene is shortened.\n* Officer Barnes' death has been edited.\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{expand section|date=September 2019}}\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' holds a 44% approval rating based on 25 critic reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018989-silent_night_deadly_night/|title=Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=October 31, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert|Siskel and Ebert]] condemned the film and Siskel went as far as to read names of the film's production crew on air, telling them, \"Shame on you\".

However, ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night 4: Initiation]]'' and ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night 5: The Toy Maker]]'' have no connection with the characters from the previous films, with each of them focusing on a different Christmas-themed horror story.\n\nA loose remake of the film, titled ''[[Silent Night (2012 film)|Silent Night]]'', was released on December 4, 2012, starring [[Jaime King]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/54429/malcolm-mcdowell-talks-silent-night-deadly-night-remake|title=Malcolm McDowell Talks Silent Night, Deadly Night Remake |publisher=Dread Central |access-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2021, another remake was announced when Orwo Studios and Black Hanger Studios acquired the rights to the original film.<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/03/controversial-horror-film-silent-night-deadly-night-getting-reboot-from-jeepers-creepers-reborn-outfit-efm-1234704653/ |title=Controversial Horror Film 'Silent Night, Deadly Night' Getting Reboot From 'Jeepers Creepers: Reborn' Outfit \u2014 EFM|first=Amanda|last=N'Duka|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 2, 2021|access-date=March 2, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3654268/silent-night-deadly-night-slasher-franchise-coming-back-life-brand-new-movie/| title = 'Silent Night, Deadly Night': Slasher Franchise Coming Back to Life With Brand New Movie! - Bloody Disgusting| date = 2 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Works cited ==\n* {{Cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1980s|volume=1|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|author=Muir, John Kenneth|isbn=978-0-786-47298-7|ref={{SfnRef|Muir|2012}}}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986|author=Rockoff, Adam|year=2011|isbn= 978-0-78646-932-1|publisher=McFarland|ref={{SfnRef|Rockoff|2011}}}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0088117|Silent Night, Deadly Night}}\n* {{allrovi movie|44692|Silent Night, Deadly Night}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1018989-silent_night_deadly_night|Silent Night, Deadly Night}}\n\n{{Silent Night, Deadly Night}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silent Night Deadly Night}}\n[[Category:1984 horror films]]\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:1984 thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1984 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:1980s Christmas horror films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas horror films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:Films about sexual repression]]\n[[Category:Films about Catholic nuns]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1971]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1974]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1984]]\n[[Category:Films set in Utah]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Salt Lake City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:Santa Claus in film]]\n[[Category:Silent Night, Deadly Night films]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Obscenity controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Films about child abuse]]\n[[Category:Films about rape]]\n[[Category:American psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:Film controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about mass murder]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Charles Sellier]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Perry Botkin Jr.]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Hickey]]\n[[Category:Advertising and marketing controversies in film]]\n[[Category:American exploitation films]]\n[[Category:1980s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:Censored films]]\n[[Category:American splatter films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
