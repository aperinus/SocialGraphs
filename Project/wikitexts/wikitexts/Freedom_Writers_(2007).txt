The movie is also based on the DC program called City at Peace.  The title of the movie and book is a play on the term \"[[Freedom Riders]]\", referring to the multiracial [[civil rights]] activists who tested the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ordering the [[desegregation]] of interstate buses in 1961.\n\nThe idea for the film came from journalist Tracey Durning, who made a documentary about Erin Gruwell for the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Primetime Live]]''. Durning served as co-executive producer of the film. The film was dedicated to the memory of Armand Jones, who was killed after filming ''Freedom Writers.'' He was fatally shot at age 18 in [[Anaheim, California]] after a confrontation with a man who robbed Jones of a necklace in a [[Denny's]] restaurant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2012/07/14/actors-death-eerily-similar-to-film-role/|title=Actor's death eerily similar to film role|work=[[Orange County Register]]|date=July 14, 2012|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1994 in [[Long Beach, California]], [[Erin Gruwell]] has been accepted to teach English for [[at-risk students]] at [[Woodrow Wilson Classical High School|Woodrow Wilson High School]]&mdash;a once highly acclaimed school that has declined since voluntary integration had been enforced and where racial tension has increased since the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]] two years before. Erin struggles to form a connection with her students and observes numerous fights between some of them, who are in rival [[gang]]s.\n\nOne night, Latin American student Eva Benitez goes into a convenience store while her boyfriend Paco, who is a fellow gang member, and two other friends stay in the car. Eva's classmate and rival Sindy Ngor, who is a Cambodian refugee, her boyfriend, and another friend also enter the store. African American student Grant Rice, frustrated about losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out, Paco, as retaliation for losing a fight against him earlier during a massive brawl at school, attempts to kill him, but misses and accidentally kills Sindy's boyfriend while Grant flees the scene and is later arrested for the homicide. As a witness, Eva must testify in court; she intends to guard \"her own\" in her testimony.\n\nThe next day at school, Erin examines a racist drawing by one of her Latin American students and utilizes it to teach the class about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], which everyone, except for White student Ben Samuels, has no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys composition books for them to use as diaries, in which they write about their experiences of being evicted, being abused, and seeing their loved ones die.\n\nDetermined to reform her students, Erin takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and activities, and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband, Scott. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus. Erin invites several Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the [[Museum of Tolerance]]. The students start to realize that being rivals against each other, just based on color, should not be a reason to prohibit their friendships with one another. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell.\n\nThe following school year comes and Erin teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day, Erin makes her class propose a \"Toast for Change\", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have [[Miep Gies]] come to the United States and tell her story of her helping [[Anne Frank]], her family, and the Van Pels hide from the [[Nazis]]; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they \"within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room.\"\n\nThese two events inspire Eva to tell the truth, breaking free of the demands of her father to always protect her own. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend at the scene; Grant is spared of being convicted while Paco is sentenced, Sindy later forgives Eva. Afterward, Eva is attacked and threatened, but ultimately spared by her fellow gang members, who dissociate from her, and she moves in with her aunt for safety.\n\nMeanwhile, Erin asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it ''The Freedom Writers Diary''. Her husband divorces her, since he feels like Erin is devoting too much of her time to her students and not enough time for their marriage. Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. After being encouraged by her father, Erin fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Erin successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate and attend college&mdash;for many, the first in their families to do so.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Erin Gruwell]]\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Scott Casey\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Steve Gruwell, Erin's Father\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Margaret Campbell\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Brian Gilford\n* [[April Lee Hern\u00e1ndez]] as Eva Benitez\n* [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]] as Andre Bryant\n* Jason Finn as Marcus\n* Vanetta Smith as Brandy Ross\n* Antonio Garcia as Miguel\n* Jaclyn Ngan as Sindy Ngor\n* Armand Jones as Grant Rice\n* [[Kristin Herrera]] as Gloria Munez\n* [[Gabriel Chavarria]] as Tito\n* [[Hunter Parrish]] as Ben Samuels\n* [[Giovonnie Samuels]] as Victoria\n* Deance Wyatt as Jamal Hill\n* Sergio Montalvo as Alejandro Santiago\n* [[Robert Wisdom]] as Dr. Carl Cohn\n* Will Morales as Paco\n* Ricardo Moline as Eva's Father\n* [[Angela Alvarado]] as Eva's Mother\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as [[Miep Gies]]\n* Lisa Banes as Karin Polachek\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Freedom Writers'' had a domestic gross of $36,605,602 and had a foreign gross of $6,485,139 bringing the movie to a total gross of $43,090,741 worldwide. On the film's opening weekend it grossed a total of $9,405,582 ranking 4th behind ''[[Children of Men]]'' (3rd), ''[[The Pursuit of Happyness]]'' (2nd), and ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' (1st).\n\n==Reception==\n''Freedom Writers'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] provides links to 126 reviews, 70% of which are positive. The critical consensus is that \"''Freedom Writers'' is a frank, formulaic entry in the inspirational inner-city teacher genre, with an energetic Hilary Swank leading the appealing cast of unknowns.\"<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>  Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 64/100 based on 29 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/freedom-writers|publisher=Metacritic|access-date=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nCynthia Fuchs of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film three out of five stars, writing in her review that \"the plot is predictable, the actors too old to play high school students, and the pacing too slow. And really, the camera circles around deep-thinking faces a few too many times. But ''Freedom Writers'' also argues for listening to teenagers. That in itself makes it a rare and close-to-wonderful thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom Writers|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/freedom-writers|publisher=Common Sense Media|access-date=6 January 2013|date=2008-10-30}}</ref> The film received a positive rating from ''Fox Weekly'', giving the film a 9 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: 'Freedom Writers' (2007)|url=http://foxweekly.com/2014/03/28/reviews/review-freedom-writers-2007.html|publisher=Fox Weekly|access-date=28 March 2014|archive-date=28 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120205/http://foxweekly.com/2014/03/28/reviews/review-freedom-writers-2007.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n=== Mrs. Gruwell as the savior ===\n''Freedom Writers'' is set in California during the 1990s, which is still feeling the effects of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] two years after the time period of the movie. The scene is set by the opening news montage chronicling the riots, and the narration from Eva explaining the racial dynamics that still pervade her city and her school. From the beginning, the perception of race is demonstrated by the students\u2019 reception of Gruwell and their attitudes towards each other, but as they come to trust her, their attitudes and behaviors change. Despite the tagline of the movie being, \u201cTheir story. Their words.
