It was produced by Britain's [[Amicus Productions]] and directed by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]]. Like Connor's other two Burroughs-derived films, ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1974 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'' and ''[[At the Earth's Core (film)|At the Earth's Core]]'', the film was distributed in the United States by [[American International Pictures]].\n\nThe film is a direct sequel to ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1974 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'', which initiated the series in 1975. The story follows a rescue expedition, led by [[Patrick Wayne]] in search of his friend, played by [[Doug McClure]], who had vanished many years before. The expedition lands on [[Caprona (island)|Caprona]], the same fantastic [[prehistoric]] land where [[dinosaur]]s and [[barbarian]] tribes of men co-exist.\n\n==Plot==\nMajor Ben McBride ([[Patrick Wayne]]) organises a mission to the Antarctic wastes to search for his friend Bowen Tyler ([[Doug McClure]]) who has been missing in the region for several years. A British naval survey ship takes them to Caprona. McBride's party: the [[paleontology|paleontologist]] Norfolk ([[Thorley Walters]]), gunner and mechanic Hogan ([[Shane Rimmer]]) and photographer Lady Charlotte 'Charlie' Cunningham ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]) fly over the mountain wall of Caprona in an amphibious aircraft, but are attacked by a fierce giant [[pterodactylus]] and forced down.\n\nThey find themselves in a world populated by primitive warriors and prehistoric creatures, all of whom they must evade in order to get back safely to their ship. They meet a [[caveman|cave-girl]], Ajor ([[Dana Gillespie]]), who can speak English (she was taught by Tyler); she leads them to the land of a race of [[samurai]]-like warriors called the Nargas, who are keeping Tyler prisoner. When the volcano that the Nargas worship erupts, they must escape the cataclysm engulfing the land. Tyler sacrifices himself to cover their retreat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Wayne]] as Ben McBride \n* [[Doug McClure]] as Bowen Tyler \n* [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] as Charly \n* [[Dana Gillespie]] as Ajor \n* [[Thorley Walters]] as Norfolk \n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Hogan \n* [[Tony Britton]] as Captain Lawton \n* [[John Hallam]] as Chung-Sha \n* [[David Prowse]] as Executioner \n* [[Milton Reid]] as Sabbala \n* [[Kiran Shah]] as Bolum \n* [[Richard LeParmentier]] as Lieutenant Whitby\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Kevin Connor, Amicus Productions wanted to follow ''[[At the Earth's Core (film)|At the Earth's Core]]'' with an adaptation of the ''[[John Carter of Mars]]'' stories, but could not afford the rights, so they made this sequel instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickfeast.co.uk/spotlight/interview-kevin-connor/|title=An Interview with Kevin Connor |website=Flickfeast|date=10 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the film was made by Amicus Productions, the company folded before it was released, meaning [[American International Pictures|AIP]] took sole credit.<ref name=\"amicus\">Ed. Allan Bryce, ''Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood'', Stray Cat Publishing, 2000, p. 150</ref>\n\n==Changes==\nThe film makes some notable changes from the book:\n* The MC flys into Caspak alone in the book, whereas he has 3 companions in the movie\n* The lost world is a \"polar continent\" rather than the interior of a polar island.\n* Bowen dies in the film and Lisa (Lys in the novels) is already dead during the events of the film, while they both survive in the novel.\n* In the book, the ship's crew scale the mountains to come to the rescue.\n* The book ends with two marriages; the film, none.\n\n==Prehistoric creatures==\n* ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' (Poster only)\n* ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Dinilysia]]'' (Portrayed by a [[Burmese python]])\n* ''[[Gigantophis]]\n* ''[[Inostrancevia]]''\n* ''[[Neanderthal]]''\n* ''[[Pterodactylus]]''\n* ''[[Scutosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Smilodon]]'' (Poster only, see above image)\n* ''[[Stegosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' (Poster only)\n* ''[[Triceratops]]'' (Poster only)\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' commented: \"A lame sequel to Connor's earlier Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptation, ''The Land That Time Forgot'', which was at least occasionally lively\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/people_that_time_forgot/reviews/|title=The People That Time Forgot - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> the ''[[Radio Times]]'' called it an \"OK sequel,\" but a \"constipated confection\" with \"ludicrous mechanised dinosaurs and hopeless acting from an interesting cast.\" The reviewer however, found that \"A few shots, composed around celebrated fantasy illustrations, compensate for all the film's shortcomings\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/wjnr/the-people-that-time-forgot/|title=The People That Time Forgot \u2013 review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}</ref> and critic Derek Winnert similarly opined \"the monsters and special effects are below par,\" but \"there are effective moments, and there is some curiosity value in seeing singer Dana Gillespie playing Ajor\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.derekwinnert.com/the-people-that-time-forgot-1977-doug-mcclure-patrick-wayne-sarah-douglas-classic-movie-review-6223/|title=The People that Time Forgot ** (1977, Doug McClure, Patrick Wayne, Sarah Douglas) \u2013 Classic Movie Review 6223 - Derek Winnert|website=www.derekwinnert.com|date=10 November 2017}}</ref> while ''Blu-ray.com'' thought the film \"may not be the most polished effort around, but there's fun to be had with its crazy dino encounters.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-People-That-Time-Forgot-Blu-ray/126466/#Review|title=The People That Time Forgot Blu-ray}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0076535|The People That Time Forgot}}\n* {{tcmdb title|86477|The People That Time Forgot}}\n* {{amg movie|37662}}\n* {{AFI film|id=55293|title=The People That Time Forgot}}\n* [http://www.eccentric-cinema.com/cult_movies/pttf.htm Eccentric Cinema \u2013 Review]\n\n{{Amicus Productions}}\n{{Kevin Connor}}\n{{Caspak trilogy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:People That Time Forgot, The (Film)}}\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:1970s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:British fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Amicus Productions films]]\n[[Category:Caspak trilogy]]\n[[Category:Films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Edgar Rice Burroughs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Connor]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Scott (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Canary Islands]]\n[[Category:Lost world films]]\n[[Category:Films about cavemen]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
