The film focuses on the [[World War II]] experiences of [[Desmond Doss]], an [[United States|American]] [[pacifist]] [[combat medic]] who, as a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] Christian, refused to carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind. Doss became the first [[conscientious objector]] to be awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], for service above and beyond the call of duty during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. [[Andrew Garfield]] stars as Doss, with [[Sam Worthington]], [[Luke Bracey]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Rachel Griffiths]], and [[Vince Vaughn]] in supporting roles.\n\nFilming took place in Australia from September to December 2015. ''Hacksaw Ridge'' was released in the United States on November 4, 2016, grossing $180.4 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim, with Gibson's direction and Garfield's performance earning particular praise. It was widely viewed as a return to form for Gibson, whose career had been in decline following [[Mel Gibson#Alcohol abuse and legal issues|several controversies]]. ''Hacksaw Ridge'' was chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of its top ten Movies of the Year,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/|title=AFI Awards: Best Of 2016 List Includes 'Silence', 'Hacksaw Ridge' & More|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 8, 2016|access-date=December 8, 2016|archive-date=December 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222192150/http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/|url-status=live}}</ref> and has received numerous awards and nominations.

That event and his [[Seventh-day Adventist]] upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|commandment]] \"[[Thou shalt not kill]].\" Fifteen years later, Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. They strike a romance, and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work.\n\nAfter the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] brings the United States into [[World War II]], Doss enlists in the [[United States Army]] to serve as a [[combat medic]]. His father, Tom, a [[World War I|First World War veteran]], is deeply upset by the decision. Desmond and Dorothy get engaged.\n\nDoss is placed in [[basic training]] under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Saturdays]]. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for [[Conscientious objection in the United States#Conscientious objectors with Medals of Honor|psychiatric reasons]] under [[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]] but are overruled, as Doss's religious beliefs do not constitute [[mental illness]]. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to drive Doss out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers.\n\nDoss's unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his [[court-martial]], Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from his former commanding officer (now a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]) stating that his son's pacifism is protected by the [[US Constitution]]. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.\n\nDoss's unit is assigned to the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]] and deployed to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]]. During the [[Battle of Okinawa]], Doss's unit will relieve the [[96th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|96th Infantry Division]], which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). During the initial fight, with heavy losses on both sides, Doss saves the life of his squadmate Smitty, earning his respect. As the Americans camp for the night, Doss reveals to Smitty that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and both reconcile.\n\nThe next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Doss's comrades are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded, and Smitty's body, to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell, and both escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.\n\nCaptain Glover apologizes for dismissing Doss's beliefs as \"cowardice\" and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Doss agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who [[perfidy|pretend to surrender]], Doss manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy [[grenade]]s. Doss is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss is lowered from the cliff clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him.\n\nThe film switches to real photos and footage showing that Doss was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by President [[Harry S. Truman]] for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, as well as real life footage of Doss just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Desmond Doss]]\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as Captain Jack Glover\n* [[Luke Bracey]] as 'Smitty' Ryker\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Tom Doss, Desmond's father\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Dorothy Schutte, Desmond's wife\n* [[Rachel Griffiths]] as Bertha Doss, Desmond's mother\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Sergeant Howell\n* [[Ryan Corr]] as Lieutenant Manville\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as Colonel Stelzer\n* [[Luke Pegler]] as Milt 'Hollywood' Zane\n* [[Richard Pyros]] as Randall 'Teach' Fuller\n* [[Ben Mingay]] as 'Grease' Nolan\n* [[Michael Sheasby]] as 'Tex' Lewis\n* [[Firass Dirani]] as Vito Rinnelli\n* [[Damien Thomlinson]] as Ralph Morgan\n* [[Matt Nable]] as Lieutenant Colonel Cooney\n* [[Ben O'Toole]] as Corporal Jessop\n* [[Nathaniel Buzolic]] as Harold 'Hal' Doss, Desmond's brother\n* [[Milo Gibson]] as 'Lucky' Ford\n* [[Goran D.
