The picture deals with the tribulations of three [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers, played by [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Montgomery Clift]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], stationed on [[Hawaii]] in the months leading up to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Donna Reed]] portray the women in their lives, and the supporting cast includes [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Philip Ober]], [[Jack Warden]], [[Mickey Shaughnessy]], [[Claude Akins]], and [[George Reeves]].\n\nThe film won eight [[Academy Awards]] out of 13 nominations, including awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Fred Zinnemann), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Supporting Actor]] (Frank Sinatra), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Supporting Actress]] (Donna Reed).<ref name=\"Oscars1954\">[http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1954 \"The 26th Academy Awards (1954) Nominees and Winners.\"] ''Oscars.org''.

Lee Prewitt transfers from [[Fort Shafter]] to a rifle company at [[Schofield Barracks]] on the island of [[Oahu]]. Because Prewitt was also a boxer, Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes wants him on his regimental team. Prewitt explains that he stopped fighting because he injured someone. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt's life miserable and ultimately orders [[First Sergeant]] Milton Warden to prepare a [[court-martial]]. Warden suggests doubling Prewitt's company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio.\n\nPrewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides with her about blinding a man and that is why he refuses to fight. At the club, Maggio gets into an argument with stockade Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes.\n\nDespite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts seeing Holmes' wife Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is fraught with infidelity, exacerbated after the stillbirth of a child and Karen's subsequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him.\n\nMaggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson's unqualified (and unauthorized) wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene's name is really Alma and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together.\n\nA sergeant named Galovitch, a member of Holmes' boxing team, picks a fight with Prewitt. The fight is reported to Holmes who observes without intervening. Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again, but when he is told that Galovitch started the fight, Holmes lets him off the hook. The regimental commander observes Holmes' conduct and, after an investigation, orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes' replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to Private, and affirms that there will be no more promotions through boxing.\n\nMaggio escapes from the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson and dies in Prewitt's arms. Seeking revenge, Prewitt waits for Judson to come out of a bar and challenges Judson into a back alley where the two fight with knives. Prewitt kills Judson, but not before being badly wounded himself; Prewitt goes [[AWOL]] and stays with Lorene while Warden covers for his absence.\n\nKaren tells Warden that Holmes' resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere some day.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack Pearl Harbor.]] Warden keeps his head in the chaos. He commands his men to remain in their barracks. He states that it's too dangerous to go outside. The Japanese start to bomb the barracks. The soldiers decide to fight the Japanese. The soldiers get excited after one shoots down a Japanese plane. That night, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company (despite Lorene's pleas for him to stay with her) but MPs shoot him dead when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a good soldier, but a hardhead.\n\nDays later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her [[Lei (garland)|leis]] into the sea wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii. Lorene tells Karen she is not returning and that her \"fianc\u00e9\", whom she identifies as Prewitt, was a bomber pilot who died heroically during the Pearl Harbor attack and was awarded a silver star (none of which is true). Karen recognizes the name, but says nothing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as First Sergeant Milton Warden<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1953/film/reviews/from-here-to-eternity-2-1200417558/|title=From Here to Eternity|last1=Brogdon|first1=William|date=1953-07-29|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/From-Here-to-Eternity-film-by-Zinnemann|title=From Here to Eternity - Plot, Cast, Awards, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref>\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as Private Robert E.

Smyth has written that the film's treatment of Judson's behavior towards Maggio \"has all the indications of sexual abuse, and therefore reintroduces the fear of homosexuality in the 1930s military that the rest of the script had to repress for obvious reasons of censorship\".<ref>Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA139#v=onepage 2014, pp. 139\u2013140.]</ref> \n  \nIn the novel, Captain Holmes ironically receives his desired promotion, and is transferred out of the company. In the film, Holmes is forced to resign from the Army under threat of court-martial for his ill-treatment of Prewitt. The Army insisted on this change, which the filmmakers reluctantly made.<ref name=hischak /><ref name=nixon /><ref>Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA136#v=onepage 2014, p. 136.]</ref> Director Zinnemann later complained that the scene where Holmes is reprimanded was \"the worst moment in the film, resembling a recruiting short\",<ref name=nixon /> and wrote, \"It makes me sick every time I see it.\"<ref name=eagan>Eagan [https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&pg=PA472#v=onepage 2010, p. 472.]</ref>\n \nIn the novel, Judson's systematic abuse of Maggio and other prisoners, including Prewitt himself at one point, is portrayed in detail. However, in the film, Maggio's abuse happens [[offscreen]], and is told only verbally to Prewitt, who remains free. The Army required that the abuse of Maggio not be shown, and that Judson's behavior towards Maggio be portrayed as \"a sadistic anomaly, and not as the result of Army policy, as depicted in Jones' book\".<ref name=nixon /> The filmmakers agreed, seeing these changes as improvements.<ref name=nixon /><ref name=eagan /> Maggio, who survives and is discharged in the novel, dies in the film,<ref name=hischak /> having been combined with two other prisoner characters from the novel (one of whom is killed by Judson in the novel) to add drama and make Maggio a stronger, more tragic figure.<ref>Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA126#v=onepage p. 126], [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA135#v=onepage 2014, pp. 135\u2013136.]</ref><ref>Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=K60eBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146#v=onepage 1992, p. 146.]</ref><ref>Dick [https://books.google.com/books?id=K60eBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA149#v=onepage 1992, p. 149.]</ref> The Army was further pacified by the filmmakers' inclusion of a line suggesting that Maggio's death was partially caused by his falling off a truck during a prison break, rather than solely by Judson's beatings.<ref>Suid [https://books.google.com/books?id=ucQeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA145#v=onepage 2002, pp. 145\u2013146.]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOpening to rave reviews, ''From Here to Eternity'' proved to be an instant hit with critics and public alike, the Southern California Motion Picture Council extolling: \"A motion picture so great in its starkly realistic and appealing drama that mere words cannot justly describe it.\"\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' agreed:\n\n<blockquote>The James Jones bestseller, ''From Here to Eternity'', has become an outstanding motion picture in this smash screen adaptation. It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business. The cast names are exceptionally good, the exploitation and word-of-mouth values are topnotch, and the prospects in all playdates are very bright, whether special key bookings or general run.<ref name=\"Variety\">Brogdon, William.

Retrieved: January 14, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOf the actors, ''Variety'' went on to say,\n\n<blockquote>Burt Lancaster, whose presence adds measurably to the marquee weight of the strong cast names, wallops the character of First Sergeant Milton Warden, the professional soldier who wet-nurses a weak, pompous commanding officer and the GIs under him. It is a performance to which he gives depth of character as well as the muscles which had gained marquee importance for his name. Montgomery Clift, with a reputation for sensitive, three-dimensional performances, adds another to his growing list as the independent GI who refuses to join the company boxing team, taking instead the 'treatment' dished out at the C.O.'s instructions. Frank Sinatra scores a decided hit as Angelo Maggio, a violent, likeable Italo-American GI. While some may be amazed at this expression of the Sinatra talent versatility, it will come as no surprise to those who remember the few times he has had a chance to be something other than a crooner in films.<ref name=\"Variety\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[New York Post]]'' applauded Frank Sinatra, remarking, \"He proves he is an actor by playing the luckless Maggio with a kind of doomed gaiety that is both real and immensely touching.\" ''[[Newsweek]]'' also stated that, \"Frank Sinatra, a crooner long since turned actor, knew what he was doing when he plugged for the role of Maggio.\" [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' concurred, writing that the film \"reveals that Frank Sinatra, in the part of Mr. Clift's best friend who winds up in the stockade, is a first-rate actor.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McCarten |first=John |date=August 8, 1953 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |page=52 }}</ref>\n\nThe cast agreed; [[Burt Lancaster]] commented in the book ''Sinatra: An American Legend'' that, \"[Sinatra's] fervour, his bitterness had something to do with the character of Maggio, but also with what he had gone through the last number of years. A sense of defeat and the whole world crashing in on him... They all came out in that performance.\"<ref name=\"Mafia\"/>\n\nDespite the rivalry between their respective characters, Sinatra and Borgnine, both from Italian roots, became lifelong friends. They corresponded with each other at Christmas season by interchanging cards signed using their film character's names \"Maggio\" and \"Fatso\". At a [[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]] honoring Sinatra, Borgnine mockingly reprised his Fatso Judson character.\n\nThe film was number one in the United States for four weeks during September 1953 with a gross of $2,087,000.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=12 Biggest Pix Grossers in September Paced by 'Eternity' ('Robe' Excluded)|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 7, 1953|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety192-1953-10#page/n3/mode/1up|access-date=September 23, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> With a final gross of $30.5 million equating to earnings of $12.2 million, ''From Here to Eternity'' not only became [[1953 in film|one of the highest-grossing films of 1953]], but also one of the ten highest-grossing films of the decade. Adjusted for inflation, its box office gross would exceed US$277 million in 2017 dollars.<ref name =\"Numbers\"/>\n\nDespite the positive response of the critics and public, the Army was reportedly not pleased with its depiction in the finished film, and refused to let its name be used in the opening credits.<ref>Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA148#v=onepage 2014, p. 148.]</ref> The [[United States Navy|Navy]] also banned the film from being shown to its servicemen, calling it \"derogatory of a sister service\" and a \"discredit to the armed services\".<ref>Smyth [https://books.google.com/books?id=-7HWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA147#v=onepage 2014, p. 147.]</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 88% from 96 reviews. The consensus summarizes: \"It has perhaps aged poorly, but this languidly paced WWII romance remains an iconic, well-acted film, featuring particularly strong performances from Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007931-from_here_to_eternity|title = From Here to Eternity|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n;[[American Film Institute]] recognition:\n*[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]]: #52\n*[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]]: #20\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
