The film received acclaim from critics, with particular praise going to its acting (especially Goldberg's performance), direction, screenplay, musical score, and production values. However, it was also criticized by some for being \"over-sentimental\" and \"stereotypical\", and was boycotted by some chapters of the [[NAACP]] for its depiction of rape. Nonetheless, the film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Goldberg, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both Avery and Winfrey, and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], but did not achieve a single win, and Spielberg did not receive a nomination for Best Director; it held the record for the film receiving the most nominations without a win at the Academy Awards since ''[[The Turning Point (1977 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1977) at this stage. It also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, with Goldberg winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]]. Spielberg received a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement]], and a Golden Globe nomination. The film was later included in [[Roger Ebert]]'s book series ''[[The Great Movies]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Smithsonian - NMAAHC - Black dress worn by Oprah Winfrey as Sofia in The Color Purple - NMAAHC 2014.184.1.1.jpg|thumb|Black dress worn by Oprah Winfrey as Sofia in ''The Color Purple'']]\n\nIn early 20th-century rural [[Hartwell, Georgia]], Celie Harris is a teenage African-American who has had two children born of rape by her abusive father, having removed them from their home before giving Celie away as a [[Forced marriage|wife]] to Albert \"Mister\" Johnson. \n\nMister, a widower, initially wanted to marry Nettie, Celie's younger sister, to whom he is attracted. He also abuses Celie, and his children mistreat her. One day, Nettie runs away from home because she is tired of fighting off her father's sexual advances and seeks shelter with Celie, where the two promise to write if they are separated. When Mister attempts to sexually assault Nettie, she fights him off and he furiously kicks her out of the house, fulfilling the promise she and Celie made.\n\nYears later, in 1916, Celie has grown [[meek]] from prolonged childhood abuse. Mister's son Harpo marries Sofia, and Celie is shocked to find her running a matriarchal household. Harpo attempts to overpower and strike Sofia, but he fails. Celie advises Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia retaliates and confronts Celie, revealing her long history of abuse. She threatens to kill Harpo if he beats her again and tells Celie to do likewise to Mister. After Harpo fails to change following years of continuous abuse between them, Sofia leaves and takes their children.\n\nMister and Harpo bring home the ailing Shug Avery, a showgirl and Mister's long-time mistress. Celie, who has slowly developed a fondness for Shug through a photograph sent to Mister, is in awe of Shug's strong will. She nurses Shug back to health, and Shug, in turn, takes a liking to her, writing and performing a song about her at Harpo's newly opened [[juke joint]]. Shug tells Celie she's moving to Memphis, and Celie confides to Shug that Mister beats her. Shug tells Celie that she is beautiful and that she loves her, and they kiss. Celie packs her things to follow Shug to Memphis, but is caught by Mister.\n\nMeanwhile, Sofia has been imprisoned for striking the town's mayor after he slaps her for cursing at his wife. Years pass, and now a shell of her former self, she is released from prison{{snd}}only to be immediately ordered by the judge to become a maid to the mayor's wife, Ms. Millie. Having not seen her children in eight years, Sofia is allotted Christmas to be with her family by Ms. Millie after encountering Celie in town, but Ms. Millie recants her offer after panicking while trying to leave the yard and not being able to get the car in gear.\n\nShug returns to Celie and Mister's home with her new husband Grady, in town on business. Grady and Mister become intoxicated while Shug checks the mailbox. She finds a letter from Celie's sister in Africa. Shug gives Celie the letter from Nettie, who tells her that she is working for a couple who adopted Celie's children. Celie and Shug realize that Mister has been hiding Nettie's letters from Celie. While he and Grady are out drinking, Shug and Celie search the house, finding a hidden compartment under the floorboards containing bundles of Nettie's unread letters.\n\nEngrossed in reading, Celie does not hear Mister's calls to shave him, and he slaps her. Celie attempts to kill Mister with his straight razor, but Shug stops her. At a family gathering, Celie finally speaks up against Mister and his years of abuse, to the delight of Shug. This fighting spirit also brings back Sofia's old self, and prompts Harpo's new girlfriend, Mary (Squeak), to stand up for herself as well. Celie responds to Mister's taunts with a curse on him. Shug and Grady drive away, taking Celie and Mary with them.\n\nYears later, Shug reunites with her father, who is a pastor, after years of estrangement because of his disapproval of the life path she chose. Mister has become a lonely drunk and let his home and farm fall into ruin. Harpo has made amends with Sofia; they now run the bar together, and Shug still performs there when she comes to town. Upon Celie's father's passing, she finally learns from Nettie's letters that he wasn't their biological father after all. When their mother died, \"his\" property was legally inherited by Celie and Nettie, and the home and shop that had belonged to her biological father pass to Celie.\n\nCelie begins to operate a tailor shop. Mister receives a letter from Nettie addressed to Celie, takes money from his secret stash, and arranges for Nettie, her husband, and Celie's children to return to the U.S. from Africa. While the redeemed Mister watches from a distance, Celie, Nettie, and the children reunite, and the two sisters bond over a [[Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man#Game|hand-clapping game]] from their childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Celie Harris Johnson\n** [[Desreta Jackson]] as young Celie Harris Johnson\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Albert \"Mister\" Johnson\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Sofia\n* [[Margaret Avery]] as Shug Avery {{small|(singing voice by [[T\u00e1ta Vega]])}}\n* [[Akosua Busia]] as Nettie Harris\n* [[Adolph Caesar]] as \"Old Mister\" Johnson, Mister's father\n* [[Willard E.

There were certain things in the [lesbian] relationship between Shug Avery and Celie that were finely detailed in Alice's book, that I didn't feel could get a [PG-13] rating. And I was shy about it. In that sense, perhaps I was the wrong director to acquit some of the more sexually honest encounters between Shug and Celie, because I did soften those.
