The film stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Otis Young]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Clifton James]], and [[Carol Kane]]. It follows two career sailors assigned to escort a young [[Reduced affect display|emotionally withdrawn]] recruit from their [[Virginia]] base to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in [[Maine]].\n\n''The Last Detail'' was theatrically released in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 12, 1973. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Nicholson and Quaid, as well as Towne's screenplay. It was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]], three [[Academy Awards]], and four [[British Academy Film Awards]] (winning two).\n\n==Plot==\nOn Saturday, December 15, 1973, Navy lifers [[Signalman]] First Class Billy \"Badass\" Buddusky ([[Jack Nicholson]]) and [[Gunner's Mate]] First Class Richard \"Mule\" Mulhall ([[Otis Young]]) are awaiting orders in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. They are assigned a [[shore patrol]] detail escorting 18-year old Seaman Larry Meadows ([[Randy Quaid]]) to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] near [[Kittery, Maine]]. Meadows has been court-martialed, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to eight years in the brig for stealing $40 from a charity fund run by the wife of a senior officer. Buddusky and Mulhall are given one week to escort Meadows to Portsmouth, and if they fail to complete the task on time or let Meadows go free, they will be kicked out of the Navy and lose all benefits and pay. Despite their initial resentment of the detail, and realizing their prisoner is a kleptomaniac who steals compulsively, Billy and Mule begin to like Meadows as they escort him on a train ride through the wintry northeastern states. They decide to show him a good time before delivering him to the authorities.\n\nWith several days to spare before they are due in Portsmouth, they make stops along their route to provide ''bon-voyage'' adventures for Meadows. In [[Washington, D.C.]], they go to a diner and order burgers, fries and milkshakes. Next they go to a bar, but they are denied drinks, as Meadows is underage and cannot provide ID. Instead they get drunk in an alley, missing their train, which forces them to stay overnight at a hotel, where they stay up all night watching TV and drinking. At the hotel, Buddusky teaches Meadows a few flag semaphore signals and tries to get the young prisoner to stick up for himself by provoking him into a fight. The next morning, they take a detour to [[Camden, New Jersey]] seeking Meadows' mother, only to find her away for the day and the house a pigsty, cluttered with empty liquor bottles. When they arrive at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]], Buddusky instigates a fight with a group of Marines in a restroom, with Mulhall and Meadows eventually joining in. The older sailors later take Meadows ice skating at [[Rockefeller Center]] and go bar-hopping, where Buddusky gambles with their per diem money by playing darts with a group of bar patrons. They also encounter a group of [[Nichiren]] Buddhists chanting in an apartment building, who teach Meadows how to pray. The Buddhists invite the trio to a house party, where one of the members offers to help Meadows flee to [[Canada]], but he declines out of loyalty to Buddusky and Mulhall. Buddusky also unsuccessfully tries to seduce a woman at the party, while Mulhall makes awkward conversation about serving in the Navy with the liberal party guests.\n\nOn the train to [[Boston]] the next morning, Buddusky and Mulhall decide to take the virginal Meadows to a whorehouse. While in [[Boston]], they flag down a cab driver, who takes them to a seedy brothel. Meadows selects a young prostitute to lose his virginity to, while Buddusky and Mulhall wait in the hallway. After an aborted first attempt where he [[Premature ejaculation|almost immediately ejaculates]], Mulhall and Buddusky pay for Meadows to have a second chance with the prostitute. Buddusky and Mulhall make conversation while waiting for Meadows, where Buddusky reminisces about his former marriage and his life prior to the Navy. The next morning, Meadows tells the other sailors that despite her profession, he thinks the young prostitute might have had romantic feelings for him.\n\nJust before they leave for Portsmouth, Meadows makes a final request for a picnic. The senior sailors buy some hot dogs and attempt a frigid barbecue in the snow at a local park, where Buddusky confides in Mulhall his concern for Meadows and the abuse that he will face at the hands of the Marines at the brig. Meadows suddenly bolts in a last-ditch effort to run away but slips on the ice and falls. Buddusky and Mulhall arrive, and Buddusky loses his temper and beats Meadows up, forcing Mulhall to restrain him.\n\nBuddusky and Mulhall take Meadows into the prison where he is marched off to be processed without a word. Although Buddusky had worried about the brutality awaiting Meadows at the hands of the Marine guards, the young duty officer (a first lieutenant wearing an [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] ring), berates Buddusky and Mulhall for striking Meadows. He asks if Meadows tried to resist or fight, which they deny. The Marine also notices that their orders were never officially signed by the master-at-arms in Norfolk, meaning effectively they had not left. The angry young Marine officer relents when Mulhall and Buddusky ask to speak to the XO ([[Executive Officer]]). On the way out, Buddusky admonishes the officer for forgetting to keep his copy of the paperwork.\n\nWith the detail complete, the pair stride away from the prison complaining about the duty officer's incompetence. Both hope their orders will have come through when they get back to Norfolk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Signalman 1st Class Billy L. \"Badass\" Buddusky\n* [[Otis Young]] as Gunner's Mate 1st Class Richard \"Mule\" Mulhall\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Seaman Laurence M. \"Larry\" Meadows\n* [[Clifton James]] as [[Master-at-arms|M.A.A.]]\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Young Whore\n* [[Michael Moriarty]] as First Lieutenant Marine Duty Officer\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Nancy\n* [[Gilda Radner]] as Nichiren Shoshu Member\n* Jim Hohn as Nichiren Shoshu Member\n* [[Luana Anders]] as Donna\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nProducer Gerry Ayres had bought the rights to Darryl Ponicsan's novel in 1969.<ref name= \"Dawson3\"/> After returning from the set of ''[[Drive, He Said]]'', Robert Towne began adapting the novel.<ref name=\"Biskind\">Biskind 1998, p. 174.</ref> The screenwriter tailored the script for close friends Jack Nicholson and [[Rupert Crosse]].<ref name= \"Biskind\"/> In adapting the novel, Towne removed Buddusky's \"closet intellectualism and his beautiful wife\".<ref name= \"berg\">{{cite news\n | last = Berg\n | first = Charles Ram\u00edrez\n | title = Robert Towne\n | work = Film Reference\n | url = http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ta-Vi/Towne-Robert.html\n | access-date = 2007-12-03}}</ref> The screenwriter also changed the ending so that Buddusky lives instead of dying as he does in the book.<ref name= \"berg\"/> Ayres convinced [[Columbia Pictures]] to produce the film based on his consultant's credit on ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie & Clyde]]'' but had difficulty getting it made because of the studio's concern about the bad language in Towne's script.<ref name= \"Dawson3\"/> [[Peter Guber]] recalls, \"The first seven minutes, there were 342 'fucks'\".<ref name= \"Biskind2\"/> The head of Columbia asked Towne to reduce the number of curse words to which the writer responded, \"This is the way people talk when they're powerless to act; they bitch\".<ref name= \"Biskind2\"/> Towne refused to tone down the language and the project remained in limbo until Nicholson, by then a bankable star, got involved.<ref name= \"Dawson3\"/>\n\nAyres sent the script to [[Robert Altman]] and then Hal Ashby.
