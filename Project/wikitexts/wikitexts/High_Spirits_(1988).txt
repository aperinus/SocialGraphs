It is an Irish, British and American co-production.\n\nSet in a remote Irish castle called Dromore Castle, Co. Limerick, ''High Spirits'' is a topsy-turvy comedy with thematic leanings towards Ireland's rich folklore regarding [[ghost]]s and spirits, where the castle starts to come to life with the help of such denizens.\n\n== Plot ==\nCash-strapped Peter Plunkett owns a dilapidated Irish castle that he has converted to a [[bed and breakfast]]. Owing money to an Irish-American businessman named Brogan, Plunkett attempts to turn the castle into \"the most haunted castle in Europe\" for the tourist trade. Inspired by his mother's stories about the castle being haunted, he and his wacky Irish staff set about creating ghostly costumes and effects for their first group of American guests.\n\nInitially annoyed by the inept \"hauntings\", the American guests (including [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Connie Booth]], [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Jennifer Tilly]]) soon discover that Castle Plunkett's real ghosts have taken umbrage at being cheaply exploited and have staged a full-scale paranormal event.\n\nTwo ghosts, Mary Plunkett and Martin Brogan (played by [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Liam Neeson]]), become romantically entangled with Guttenberg's and D'Angelo's characters. This romantic twist becomes the main focus of the plot.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] \u2013 Mary Plunkett Brogan\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] \u2013 Peter Plunkett\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] \u2013 Jack Crawford\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] \u2013 Sharon Brogan Crawford\n* [[Liam Neeson]] \u2013 Martin Brogan\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] \u2013 Miranda\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] \u2013 Brother Tony\n* [[Ray McAnally]] \u2013 Plunkett Senior\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] \u2013 Malcolm Clay\n* [[Connie Booth]] \u2013 Marge Clay\n* [[Donal McCann]] \u2013 Eamon\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] \u2013 Lavinia Plunkett\n* [[Mary Coughlan (singer)|Mary Coughlan]] \u2013 Katie\n* [[Ruby Buchanan]] \u2013 Great Aunt Nan\n* [[Isolde Cazelet (09.06.1917-05.01.1989)]] \u2013 Julia\n* [[Aim\u00e9e Delamain]] \u2013 Great Granny Plunkett\n* [[Tom Hickey (actor)|Tom Hickey]] \u2013 Sampson\n* [[Krista Hornish]] \u2013 Wendy Clay\n* [[John Nee|Little John]] \u2013 Gateman\n* [[Preston Lockwood]] \u2013 Great Uncle Peter\n* [[Paul O'Sullivan (actor)|Paul O'Sullivan]] \u2013 Graham Clay\n* [[Hilary Reynolds]] \u2013 Patricia\n* [[Tony Rohr]] \u2013 Christy\n* [[Matthew Wright (actor)|Matthew Wright]] \u2013 Woody Clay\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics.
