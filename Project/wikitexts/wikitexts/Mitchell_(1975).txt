McLaglen]], written by [[Ian Kennedy Martin]], and starring [[Joe Don Baker]] as an abrasive police detective. The film was released in the United States on September 10, 1975 by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation]].\n\nVery much an [[anti-hero]], Mitchell often ignores the orders of his superiors and demonstrates disdain for by-the-book development work as well as normal social graces. The film co-stars [[John Saxon]] and [[Martin Balsam]] as the banking criminals Mitchell pursues and [[Linda Evans]] and [[Merlin Olsen]] in supporting roles as a prostitute and henchman.\n\nThe film had a resurgence after being featured in a season 5 episode of the comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[trade union]] [[lawyer]] named Walter Deaney ([[John Saxon]]) kills a [[burglar]] in his house. Only an unorthodox plainclothes detective named Mitchell ([[Joe Don Baker]]) believes that Deaney is guilty of something more than [[self-defense]], but [[Chief of Police]] Albert Pallin ([[Robert Phillips (actor)|Robert Phillips]]) tells him that Deaney is wanted for \"every federal law violation in the book\" and is therefore \"[[FBI]] property.\"\n\nTo keep Mitchell away from Deaney, the Chief orders him to [[Stakeout|stake out]] the home of James Arthur Cummins ([[Martin Balsam]]), a wealthy man with ties to the [[American Mafia|mob]] whose \"big scene\" is the import and export of stolen merchandise. Mitchell initially is unconcerned with Cummins and focuses primarily on Deaney. But he gets drawn in after Cummins discovers that Salvatore Mistretta ([[Morgan Paull]]), cousin of his ''[[mafioso (criminal)|mafioso]]'' benefactor Tony Gallano ([[Harold J. Stone]]), is bringing in a shipment of stolen [[heroin]] from [[Mexico]] without Cummins' approval.\n\nMeanwhile, a high-priced [[call girl|escort]] named Greta ([[Linda Evans]]) shows up at Mitchell's apartment. Mitchell allows her to come in, and after spending two nights with her and arresting her for possession of [[marijuana]], he discovers that Deaney is paying her $1,000 per night to entertain Mitchell. After unsuccessfully trying to [[bribe]] Mitchell with Greta's services and an offer of an illicit real estate deal, Deaney decides to work with Cummins to eliminate the annoying cop. Deaney is killed shortly thereafter during an attempt on Mitchell's life.\n\nCummins refuses to let Mistretta use his port facilities to bring in the shipment, causing Gallano to send thugs to harass him. Cummins decides that the only ally he still has\u2014aside from his faithful butler and bodyguard, Benton ([[Merlin Olsen]])\u2014is Mitchell, because he's no good to the police dead. In exchange for his own freedom, Cummins offers to allow Mitchell to pose as a chauffeur and pick up the shipment, putting him in a position to both confiscate the drugs and arrest Mistretta. However, Cummins [[double cross (betrayal)|double-crosses]] Mitchell by alerting Mistretta to his real identity. He also double-crosses Mistretta by replacing the heroin with chalk. Mistretta decides to kill Mitchell and dump the body on Cummins' boat.\n\nMistretta is killed in the subsequent gun battle, allowing Mitchell to go after Cummins, who is attempting to flee the country by sea. Mitchell is dropped onto the boat by helicopter and kills Benton with a [[Fishing gaff|gaff hook]]. Cummins is killed by a close-range shot from an assault rifle after one final attempted double-cross fails, bringing the central plot to a close.\n\nMitchell returns to his apartment to find Greta awaiting him. Mitchell brushes her off, pointing out that she is no longer being paid to keep him company. Despite this, Greta wishes to spend the night with Mitchell. However, he detects the scent of marijuana on her and the film concludes on what is intended to be a humorous beat, as Mitchell prepares to haul Greta off to jail for a second possession charge.\n\n===Alternate version===\nIn 1980, a heavily edited version of the 1975 film was released for broadcast television, in which most of the violence and all of the nudity and profanity were removed. Several scenes in the film were shot twice for this purpose.\n\n* Greta writes on the windshield of Mitchell's car with lipstick. In the theatrical release the word written on the windshield is \"BASTARD\" while in the TV version the word is \"JERK.\"\n* The sequence during the dinner scene with the phony argument between Cummins and Benton was also shot twice to substitute \"goddamn awful butler\" with \"lousy butler\".\n* The scene with Mitchell arguing with Greta's son was edited with Mitchell saying \"Buzz off, kid!\" in the TV version instead of \"Piss off, kid!\" in the theatrical release. His remark, \"Go to Hell!\", to Greta's son as he skateboards away was also censored.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Mitchell'' was generally panned by critics upon its release. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>''Mitchell'', starring [[Joe Don Baker]] as a hard-nosed Los Angeles detective named Mitchell, has a lot of over-explicit violence, some gratuitous sex stuff and some rough language, yet it looks like a movie that couldn't wait to get to prime-time television. Perhaps it's a pilot film for a TV series, or maybe it's just a movie that's bad in a style we associate with some of the more mindless small-screen entertainments.\n\nMitchell spends what seems to be the greater part of the film climbing in and out of automobiles, driving automobiles, chasing other automobiles, parking automobiles, and leaning against the body of automobiles that are temporarily at rest. Once he smashes a hoodlum's hand in the door of an automobile.\n\nThe climax, for a giddy change of pace, features a police helicopter in pursuit of a high-speed cabin cruiser. Automobiles sink when driven onto water.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9901EFDC163FE034BC4952DFBF66838E669EDE Movie Review, Vincent Canby]</ref></blockquote>\n\nSaid the ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' film guide:\n\n<blockquote>Baker's the big lumpy cop who won't take no and another assignment for an answer when he's told to lay off the gun-happy lawyer (Saxon) he suspects of cold-blooded murder, and to concentrate on the businessman with the coke connection (Balsam). He realises that in such a sparsely-populated cheapie they just have to be in collusion, as he punches and shoots his way to the final credits accompanied by vocal encouragement from one of those country singers with terminal cancer. Balsam and Saxon contribute no more than their required quota of urbane sneers before being bulldozed into oblivion by the golem hero of this irredeemably routine potboiler.<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/73357.html ''Time Out'' Review: ''Mitchell'']</ref></blockquote>\n\n==''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' episode==\nOn October 23, 1993, the edited-for-television release of ''Mitchell'' was featured as an episode of ''Mystery Science Theater 3000''.<ref name=\"sea5\">[http://www.mst3kinfo.com/episodes/epfive.html SEASON FIVE: 1993-1994.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220205/http://www.mst3kinfo.com/episodes/epfive.html |date=September 26, 2011 }} Satellite News. Retrieved on 2007-05-18.</ref> The film was trimmed by several minutes to match ''MST3K'''s format. This resulted in John Saxon's character, killed by Mitchell in a deleted scene, simply vanishing from the action. The only mention of his disappearance was a voiceover by a radio announcer stating that Saxon's character had died. Tom Servo remarks on this lapse with the question, \"Hey, guys, wasn't John Saxon in this movie?\" Particularly mocked were Mitchell's alcoholism, slovenliness and uncouth behavior. During the opening credits, Servo and Crow mock the theme song by improvising lyrics about food and Mitchell's weight, briefly referencing [[Theme from Shaft|the theme song]] from ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]''.\n\nAccording to page 97 of the ''Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide'', the cast had heard a rumor that actor Joe Don Baker was very angry at the ''MST3K'' treatment of ''Mitchell'', and threatened physical violence on any of the cast or crew, should he ever meet them in person. This did not stop them from later featuring (and happily mocking) another of Baker's films, ''[[Final Justice (1985 film)|Final Justice]]'', and hurling even more vicious insults at Baker.<ref>[http://www.mst3kinfo.com/episodes/epten.html SEASON TEN: 1999.] Satellite News.

Nevertheless, ''MST3K'' head writer and star [[Michael J. Nelson]] stated that he avoided running into Baker when he discovered that they were both staying at the same hotel.\n\nThe episode is also notable for its host segment's subplot involving [[Gypsy (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Gypsy]], who overhears the Mads plotting to kill their new temp, [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike]], and mistakenly thinks they are planning to kill [[Joel Robinson|Joel]]. Working with Mike, Gypsy locates an escape pod and uses it to \"save\" Joel's life, ending his imprisonment on the [[Satellite of Love (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Satellite of Love]]. The Mads then abandon their plan to fire Mike, and instead send him to the SoL to replace Joel.\n\nThe episode was chosen by fans to appear in the ''MST3K'' 2016 Turkey Day Marathon.
