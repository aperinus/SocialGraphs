Please do not add a single genre or repeating at cost.--> directed by [[John Lasseter]] (in his feature [[directorial debut]]), produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The first installment in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|'' Toy Story'' franchise]], it was the [[Firsts in animation|first entirely computer-animated feature film]], as well as the first feature film from Pixar. It was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. The film features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot of ''Toy Story'' focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and a modern space cadet action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Tin Toy]]'', a [[short film]] that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced ''Toy Story'' under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], United States, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"Numbers\" /> eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the [[1995 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1995]]. The film received critical acclaim, and holds a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|{{RT data|score}} approval rating]] on Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, screenplay, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is considered by many to be [[List of films considered the best#Animation (shorts and features)|one of the best animated films ever made]].<ref name=\"best-animation\" /> The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations ([[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (the first animated film to be nominated for this award), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\", and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]) as well as honoring a non-competitive [[Special Achievement Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Susan |title=How 'Toy Story' changed the face of animation, taking off 'like an explosion' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html |access-date=September 30, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070711/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, ''Toy Story'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of seven films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of ''Toy Story'' launched a multimedia franchise and a series of three sequels, starting with ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999). The film also had a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as a part of a double feature with the second film.\nA spin-off, ''[[Lightyear (film)|Lightyear]]'', was released in 2022, with [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] voicing the in-universe human Buzz Lightyear who inspired the action figure toyline in the ''Toy Story'' films.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries should contain only the bare basics of info and should be less than 700 words long. The current word count is 640, so please check the count carefully before adding anything. -->\n\nIn a world where toys come alive when humans are not present, a group of toys are preparing to move into a new house with their owner, [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], his sister, [[Molly Davis|Molly]], and [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|their single mother]]. The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; pullstring cowboy doll [[Sheriff Woody]], Andy's favorite toy and their leader, sends [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]] and his green army men to spy on the gift-opening with a [[baby monitor]] in hopes of calming the others. The other toys (which include [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog (character)|Slinky Dog]],  [[Rex (Toy Story)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]],  [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm]] the [[piggy bank]] and [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]] the [[porcelain doll]]) are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift from his mother: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure who believes he is a ''real'' space ranger. Buzz impresses and shows off to the other toys with his various features, and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, making Woody jealous.\n\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy. To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the [[radio-controlled car]] [[List of Toy Story characters#RC|RC]] to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys (except for Bo and Slinky) suspect Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge. A furious Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.\n\nAfter a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. However, Buzz mistakes a [[claw crane]] full of [[List of Toy Story characters#Aliens / Little Green Men|Little Green Men]] for a spaceship, and enters it, with Woody in pursuit. Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor [[Sid Phillips (Toy Story)|Sid Phillips]] spots and captures the two, along with a Little Green Man, and takes them to his house, where they encounter his vicious [[English Bull Terrier|Bull Terrier]] Scud and his much-abused \"mutant\" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\n\nAs Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a Buzz Lightyear action figure TV commercial that proves he is indeed a toy. In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a [[firework|rocket]], planning to blow him to pieces, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, while admitting his own insecurities. This conversation restores Buzz's resolve, and the two work to get out of Sid's house. Just as Sid takes Buzz out to attempt to launch him, Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing him and Buzz.\n\nWoody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street. Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely beside Andy.\n\nAt Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift-opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Potato Head|Mrs. Potato Head]], and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a [[dachshund]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Buster|puppy]].\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horiztotal\n| align = right\n| total_width = 400\n| footer = [[Tom Hanks]] (left) and [[Tim Allen]] (right), the voices of [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear]] respectively.\n| image1 = Tom Hanks TIFF 2019.jpg\n| image2 = Tim Allen 2012.jpg\n}}\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]], a [[pullstring]] [[cowboy]] doll and Bo Peep's love interest who is Andy's favorite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a Space Ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog (character)|Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], the toys' owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next-door neighbor, who destroys toys for fun.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy and Molly's single mother.\n* [[R.

In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film, ''[[Tin Toy]]'', which was told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[61st Academy Awards|1989 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]], CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]], sought to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. {{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio.

They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider did not want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a [[List of United States Christmas television specials|Christmas television special]], ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter's talents {{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self-described \"tyrant\" and micro-manager,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} but invited them to talk with Disney's animators and get their opinions on working under him. Lasseter was impressed with what he heard, and the two companies began negotiations,{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar's animation technology{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar's involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\" BizWeekBOX\" /> These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\n\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized, and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\"PixMagicMan\">{{cite news |last=Schlender |first=Brent |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm |title=Pixar's magic man |date=May 17, 2006 |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |access-date=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOriginally, ''Toy Story'' was going to star \"Tinny\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the ''Tin Toy'' short film, along with \"the dummy\", a [[ventriloquist's dummy]]. While the film's premise was still about toys' desire to be played with by children, the rest of the film's script, which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station, meeting up with the dummy, and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day, was quite different.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=121}} Katzenberg was unhappy with the [[Film treatment|treatment]] drafted by Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]], as the two character's motivations were too similar. Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a [[buddy film]], giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final version of the film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child's favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family's moving van.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}\n\nThe script went through many changes before the final version of it. Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and was then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually [[Buzz Lightyear]] (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I. Joe]] action figures. Also, the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear's suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite colors are green and purple, respectively.<ref name=\"BuzzDesign\">{{cite news |title=Disney's Buzz Lightyear and Wall-E explore space for NASA |publisher=[[Space.com]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-062408a.html |access-date=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724051156/http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-062408a.html|archive-date=July 24, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=103}} Woody was inspired by a [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] doll that Lasseter had when he was a child; he was a ventriloquist's dummy with a pull-string (hence the name \"Woody\").

Lasseter liked the contrast between the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and the [[science fiction]] genres and the character immediately changed.
