The film tells the story of William Munny, an aging outlaw and killer who takes on one more job, years after he had turned to farming. The film co-stars [[Gene Hackman]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Richard Harris]].\n\n''Unforgiven'' grossed over $159&nbsp;million on a budget of $14.4&nbsp;million and received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for the acting (particularly from Eastwood and Hackman), directing, editing, themes and cinematography. The film won four [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Clint Eastwood, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Gene Hackman, and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] for editor Joel Cox. Eastwood was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, but he lost to [[Al Pacino]] for ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''.

As punishment, local [[sheriff]] \"Little Bill\" Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, David \"Davey\" Bunting, to turn over several of their horses to her employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a $1,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for the cowboys' deaths.\n\nIn [[Hodgeman County]], [[Kansas]], a boastful young man calling himself the \"Schofield Kid\" visits Will Munny's hog farm, claiming to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and that his children's future is in jeopardy. Will recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid.\n\nBack in Big Whiskey, British-born [[gunfighter]] \"English\" Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill, seeks the bounty. He arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, who naively believes Bob's exaggerated tales. Enforcing the town's anti-gun law, Little Bill and his deputies disarm Bob, and the sheriff beats him savagely to discourage other would-be gunmen from attempting to claim the bounty. Little Bill humiliates Bob and banishes him from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of fascination with the sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the [[Wild West]]. Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire, rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first.\n\nWill, Ned, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and head into Skinny's saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, a feverish Will is sitting alone when Little Bill and his deputies confront him. Not realizing Will's identity but correctly guessing he also wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his [[pistol]], beats him, and throws him out into the rain. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and manage to take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush and kill Davey in front of his friends. After missing Davey and hitting his horse instead, Ned realizes that he does not want to kill again and resolves to return home; Will then shoots and kills Davey himself.\n\nFeeling they must finish the job, Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys' ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the [[outhouse]] and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before and renounces life as a gunfighter. When one of the prostitutes arrives to give them the reward, they learn that Ned was captured and tortured to death by Little Bill and his men after revealing Will's true identity. The Kid gives Will his [[Schofield revolver|revolver]] and returns to Kansas with the reward, giving equal shares to both Ned\u2019s widow and Will\u2019s children. Will begins drinking before he heads back to Big Whiskey to take revenge on Little Bill.\n\nThat night, Will arrives and sees Ned's corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinny's saloon as a warning to any other \"assassins\". Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a [[Posse comitatus|posse]]. Will walks in alone brandishing a [[shotgun]] to confront the posse and uses his first shot to kill Skinny. He holds Little Bill at gunpoint and the sheriff instructs his men to kill Will after he shoots him. The shotgun misfires, so Will throws it at Little Bill, draws his revolver, shoots Little Bill, and then calmly kills three of Bill's deputies as their panicked shots miss him. Will recovers Ned's rifle and orders the bystanders to leave the saloon. Beauchamp stays behind and questions Will about the killings, and what it's like to be an outlaw. Will scares Beauchamp out of the saloon, and prevents a mortally wounded Little Bill from shooting him. Little Bill promises to see Will in [[Hell]], and Will kills him. Will leaves Big Whiskey, warning the townsfolk that he will return if Ned is not buried properly or if any more of the prostitutes are harmed.\n\nDuring the epilogue, a title card states that Will and his children abandoned their farm (leaving behind his wife's grave) and are rumored to have moved to [[San Francisco]], prospering in [[dry goods]]. It also states that Will's in-laws, upon finding the ruins of the farm years later, never understood what their daughter saw in Will Munny, not realizing the depths of his feelings for her and how faithful he remained to her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n*[[Clint Eastwood]] as William Munny\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Sheriff \"Little\" Bill Daggett\n*[[Morgan Freeman]] as Ned Logan\n*[[Richard Harris]] as English Bob\n*[[Jaimz Woolvett]] as The Schofield Kid\n*[[Saul Rubinek]] as W.W.

Men who claim to be fearless killers are either exposed as cowards and weaklings or self-promoting liars, while others find that they no longer have it in them to take another life. A writer with no conception of the harshness and cruelty of frontier life publishes stories that glorify common criminals as infallible men of honor. The law is represented by a pitiless and cynical former gunslinger whose idea of justice is often swift and without mercy, and while the main protagonist initially tries to resist his violent impulses, the murder of his friend drives him to become the same cold-blooded killer he once was, suggesting that a Western hero is not necessarily \"the good guy\", but rather \"just the one who survived\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Unforgiven (1992) |url=https://deepfocusreview.com/definitives/unforgiven/ |access-date=2020-10-01 |website=Deep Focus Review |archive-date=2020-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923003504/https://deepfocusreview.com/definitives/unforgiven/ |url-status=live}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=April 2021}}\n\n''Unforgiven'' does not offer a singular set of moral guidelines that the protagonists follow and the antagonists disobey. Instead, each character acts on what they think is right for them, and they often act in both morally right and wrong ways. Munny gets justice for Delilah and avenges Ned, but despite his noble actions, Munny's character is haunted by his violent past, where he was notorious for killing any man, woman or child. Allen Redmon's \"Mechanisms of Violence in Clint Eastwood's ''Unforgiven'' and ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''\" describes Munny's role as an antihero by stating he is \"a virtuous or an injured hero [that] overcomes all obstacles to see that evil is eradicated using whatever means necessary\".<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-4726.2004.00139.x |title=Mechanisms of Violence in Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River' |first=Allen |last=Redmon |date=7 October 2004 |journal=The Journal of American Culture |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=315\u2013328 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-4726.2004.00139.x |access-date=2021-04-18 |archive-date=2021-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516203525/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1537-4726.2004.00139.x |url-status=live}}</ref> Munny's repeated acts of killing, to accomplish what he sees as just, eventually cause him to fall into his old ways of being a man corrupted by violence. Other characters in the film such as Ned and the Schofield Kid disagree with Munny's methods of justice after they decide they can no longer live a life where they kill others. Munny is motivated to kill in order to earn the bounty for Quick Mike and Davey Bunting. Though he realizes killing is difficult, he ultimately decides to return to the life of a gunslinger in order to provide for his children, which he thinks is the morally responsible thing to do for him and his family.{{Original research inline|date=April 2021}}\n\nDuality: [[Nondualism|Nonduality]] asks us to view good and evil as two parts of an undivided whole with good possessing evil and evil possessing good. This non-dualistic view is represented very well by the Chinese Dao symbol. In the movie, Will Munny views the world through a dualistic lens. Will sees every person that he comes across in a polarized way. And so when he aims to kill someone, he considers if they are good or bad, guilty or innocent, and there is no gray area through which to judge an entire person\u2019s life. Little Bill killed Ned and so he must die. Quick Mike and Davey Bunting cut up Delilah and so they must die. Will\u2019s worldview is as Durkheim describes when he writes, \u201cat all times, man himself has had a keen sense of this duality. Everywhere, indeed, he has conceived of himself as formed of two radically heterogeneous beings: the body, on the one hand, the soul on the other\u201d (Durkheim, 2005). For Will the world is black and white and he is the judge and executioner.<ref>Durkheim, \u00c9mile. \u201cThe Dualism of Human Nature and Its Social Conditions.\u201d Berghahn Journals, Berghahn Journals, 1 Dec. 2005, https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/durkheimian-studies/11/1/ds110105.xml?ArticleBodyColorStyles=pdf-4278.</ref>\n\n==Literary allusions==\n''Unforgiven'' shares many parallels with Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d, in characters and themes. \u201cIn both works, the protagonists-Achilles and William Munny are self-questioning warriors who temporarily reject the culture of violence only to return to it after the death of their closest male friend, in which they are implicated\u201d (534).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blundell |first1=Mary Whitlock |last2=Ormand |first2=Kirk |date=1997 |title=Western Values, or the Peoples Homer: \"Unforgiven\" as a Reading of the \"Iliad\" |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1773186 |journal=Poetics Today |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=533\u2013569 |doi=10.2307/1773186 |jstor=1773186 |issn=0333-5372}}</ref> Munny and Achilles have the same dilemma between fate and counter-fate. They know that their fate is being a warrior and likely dying that way, however they both try to reject it for at least some time. Munny continually claims he has changed and \u201cain\u2019t like that no more\u201d referring to his warrior-like hitman past, whereas Achilles continually refuses to be a soldier in the Greek army since he condemns Agamemnon for not stopping the war when he could have.\n\nNeither wants to kill for causes from their past (Munny being an outlaw, Achilles being a warrior-king) since they find them unjust. Both are committed to a \u201chigher\u201d cause\u2014Munny to his children and his wife\u2019s wishes, and Achilles to the injustice of women-stealing and to Briseis, who at one point he would\u2019ve had to sacrifice to Agamemnon to stop the war.\n\nHowever, when their best friends are killed\u2014Achilles\u2019 Patroklos and Munny\u2019s Ned\u2014they allow their rage and desire for vengeance to make them return to their warrior-prescribed fate. Achilles rages against the Trojans and kills many. He gets vengeance by killing Hector and desecrating his corpse, dragging it around the town. Munny rages against Little Bill and his crew. He gets vengeance by killing them and Little Bill, threatening to kill anyone who opposes him.\n\nThere are however relevant differences in Homer\u2019s epic and Eastwood\u2019s film, namely that Achilles is fated to die in battle, whereas Munny moves to California at the end of the film to become a businessman to provide for his kids. Whether Munny has successfully countered his warrior-fate is unclear, as is whether a life in dry goods redeems him as his love for his wife had done.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at the top position in its opening weekend.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fox |first=David J. |date=August 18, 1992 |title=Weekend Box Office: Eastwood Still Tall in the Saddle |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-18/entertainment/ca-5744_1_weekend-box-office |access-date=December 1, 2010 |archive-date=April 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402055245/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-18/entertainment/ca-5744_1_weekend-box-office |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Fox |first=David J. |date=August 25, 1992 |title=Weekend Box Office: 'Unforgiven' at Top for Third Week |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-25/entertainment/ca-6052_1_weekend-box-office |access-date=December 1, 2010 |archive-date=April 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402055251/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-25/entertainment/ca-6052_1_weekend-box-office |url-status=live}}</ref> Its earnings of $15 million ($7,252 average from 2,071 theaters) in its opening weekend was the best-ever opening for an Eastwood film at that time.{{sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=473}} It spent a total of three weeks as the No.&nbsp;1 film in North America.
