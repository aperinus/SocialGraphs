Although married to Verna, he is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, \"Ma\" Jarrett.\n\nCody and his gang rob a [[Railway Mail Service|mail train]] in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains, killing four members of the train's crew. While on the lam, Cody has a severe migraine, which Ma nurses him through. Afterward, Ma and Cody have a quick drink and toast, \"Top of the world!\", before rejoining the others. The gang splits up.\n\nInformants enable the authorities to close in on a motor court in Los Angeles where Cody, Verna, and Ma are holed up. Cody shoots and wounds [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] investigator Philip Evans and makes his escape. He then puts his emergency scheme in motion: confess to a lesser crime committed by an associate in [[Springfield, Illinois]], at the same time as the train job\u2014a federal crime\u2014thus providing him with a false [[alibi]] and assuring him a lesser sentence. He turns himself in and is sentenced to one to three years in state prison. Evans, however, plants undercover agent Hank Fallon (as \"Vic Pardo\") in Cody's cell. His task is to find the \"Trader\", a fence who launders stolen money for Cody.\n\nOn the outside, \"Big Ed\" Somers, Cody's ambitious right-hand man, takes charge. Verna betrays Cody and joins Ed. Ed pays inmate Roy Parker to kill Cody. In the prison workshop, Parker attempts to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Cody, but Hank pushes Cody out of the way, saving his life and gaining Cody's trust. Ma visits and vows to \"take care of\" Big Ed, despite Cody's frantic attempts to dissuade her. He starts worrying and decides to break out with Hank. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Verna has murdered Ma, whom she despised, by shooting her in the back.  Big Ed knows this and holds this information over Verna to keep her with him. When Cody learns of Ma's death by way of a new inmate, he goes berserk in the mess hall. He concocts an escape plan.\n\nIn the infirmary, he is diagnosed as having a \"homicidal psychosis\" and is recommended for transfer to an asylum. Another inmate sneaks him a gun, which Cody uses to take hostages, and along with Hank and their cellmates, Cody escapes. They also take along Parker. Cody later kills him in cold blood.\n\nWhen they learn of Cody's escape, Big Ed and Verna anxiously await his return. Verna tries slipping away, but Cody catches her. Although Verna murdered Ma, she convinces Cody that Big Ed did it, so Cody guns him down. The gang welcome the escapees, including Hank, whom Cody likes and trusts. They start planning their next job.\n\nA stranger shows up at the gang's isolated hideout, asking to use the phone. Hank is concerned. Cody introduces the stranger as \"The Trader,\" Daniel Winston. Cody plans to steal a chemical plant's payroll by using an empty tanker truck as a [[Trojan horse]].  Hank says he will repair Verna's radio, then rigs a signal transmitter and attaches it to the Trojan tanker; on the way to the plant, he manages to get a message to Evans. The police track the tanker and prepare an ambush.\n\nThe gang gets into the payroll office, but the tanker driver, ex-con \"Bo\" Creel, recognizes Hank and informs Cody. Having tracked the truck to [[Long Beach, California]], using [[direction finder]]s, the police surround the building and call on Cody to surrender; he decides to fight it out. When the police fire [[tear gas]] into the office, Hank manages to escape. In the ensuing gun battle, the police kill most of Cody's gang and Verna is arrested. Cody shoots one of his own men for trying to surrender. Finally, only Cody is still loose. He flees to the top of a gigantic, [[Horton Sphere|globe-shaped gas storage tank]]. After Hank shoots Cody several times with a rifle, Cody fires at the tank, which bursts into flames. He shouts \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" before the tank explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Virginia Mayo and James Cagney in White Heat trailer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mayo and Cagney]]\n* [[James Cagney]] as Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett<ref name=Crowther>[[Bosley Crowther|Crowther, Bosley]].

Likewise, the last thing [[Jack L.

Retrieved July 31, 2017.</ref> For years, Cagney resisted gangster roles in an effort to avoid typecasting, but decided to return to the genre after feeling his box office power waning.<ref name=Eagan/> Following Cagney's attachment, Warner increased the production budget to $1 million<ref name=NollenS/> and hired [[Raoul Walsh]] to direct. Walsh had previously worked with Cagney on ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' (in 1939) and ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]'' (in 1941). However, Cagney was unhappy with the studio's decision to hire Walsh; in part, because he requested [[Frank McHugh]] be in the film, but Warner turned his friend down in an attempt to cut costs.<ref name=Eagan/>\n\n===Writing===\nWarner bought the rights to the story from [[Virginia Kellogg]] for $2,000.<ref name=NollenS>Nollen, chapter 15, page 1.</ref> Being \"methodical craftsmen\", it took Goff and Roberts six months to complete the first draft. They \"would plot in complete detail before even beginning to write, then write their dialogue together, line by line.\"<ref name=VallanceT/> When Walsh saw it, he pleaded with Cagney's brother, William, to talk Cagney out of doing the picture. According to him, the draft was \"bad\u2014a real potboiler,\" but William reassured Walsh that \"Jimmy [would] rewrite it as much as possible.\"<ref name=MMoss>Moss, page 169.</ref>\n\n''White Heat'' was meant to be based on the true story of [[Ma Barker]], a bank robber who raised her four sons as criminals. However, this was changed along with Cagney's involvement; Ma Barker became Ma Jarrett, and her four children were reduced to two. [[Arthur Barker]] became Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett, a psychopath with a mother fixation.<ref name=HughesH>Hughes, chapter 4, page 4.</ref><ref name=Eagan/> Cody's mental illness and the exact cause of his migraines remain a mystery throughout the film. This was done intentionally, enabling viewers to use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions.<ref name=Eagan/> In total, the script received several rewrites, with input being given from some of Cagney's closest friends. [[Humphrey Bogart]] and Frank McHugh worked \"after hours\" on revisions; with McHugh writing the film's opening scene.<ref name=MMoss/>\n\nThe script is notable for reworking many themes from Cagney's previous films with Warner. Most notably, in ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', Cagney smashed a grapefruit into [[Mae Clarke]]'s face; in ''White Heat'' he kicks [[Virginia Mayo]] off a chair. In ''[[Each Dawn I Die]]'', his character suffers the ill effects of prison; while here, his character has a breakdown in the prison mess hall. Furthermore, in ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' Cagney fought with rival gangsters in a similar fashion to how Cody Jarrett stalks the double-crossing \"Big Ed\" Somers (portrayed by [[Steve Cochran]]).<ref name=Eagan/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Prisonscene.whiteheat.cagney.png|thumb|upright=1.44|{{center|The prison mess hall scene involving 600 extras was shot in under three hours}}]]\nThe production began on May 5, 1949, and lasted six weeks until completion on June 20. Walsh made use of a number of locations in southern California; first by going to the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] (near his home) to shoot \"chase scenes\".<ref name=NFBMoss/> He then moved on to an old [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] tunnel near [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]] to stage the opening robbery scenes.<ref name=HHughesp5>Hughes, chapter 4, pages 5-6.</ref> Urban street scenes along with the \"Milbank Hotel\" were shot in and around [[Van Nuys]].<ref name=HHughesp5/> The \"hideaway lodge sequences\" were shot at the [[Columbia Ranch|Warner ranch]], the interior scenes in the studio itself, and the climax scene at an oil refinery near [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], south of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=NFBMoss/><ref name=HHughesp5/> The drive-in theater scenes were shot at the now demolished San Val Drive-In in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].<ref name=GabelW>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2417|title= San Val Drive-In|website=www.cinematreasures.org |accessdate= 31 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nJack Warner wanted the prison mess hall scene replaced for budgetary reasons, stating the \"cost of a single scene with 600 extras and only one line of dialogue would be exorbitant.\" For this reason, Warner wanted the scene shot in a chapel, but relented when \"the writers pointed out that, apart from the fact that Jarrett would [never be willingly caught in a] chapel\", the whole point of the scene was to \"have a lot of noise, with rattling knives and forks and chatter, that suddenly goes completely silent when Jarrett first screams.\" The scream was improvised by Cagney, and the shock on everyone's face was real, for neither Cagney nor Walsh informed any of the extras of what was going to happen.<ref name=HHughesp5/> Warner agreed to the scene on the condition that it be shot in three hours, so \"that the extras were through by lunchtime.\"<ref name=VallanceT/>\n\nA number of scenes were improvised; Walsh's \"personal touches go beyond the script.\" When Cody and his gang hide out in their cabin just after the train heist, Cody has one of his \"debilitating headaches\", causing him to fall from his chair and fire off a round from his .45. This was Walsh's idea, as was the showing of [[Virginia Mayo]]'s upper thigh on screen. Another scene involved Cody giving his wife, Verna, a \"seething look\", but Walsh improvised and had Cagney knock her off of her chair.<ref name=VallanceT/> Cagney claimed it was his idea \"to have Cody climb onto Ma Jarrett's lap and sit there; being soothed during one of his psychotic [episodes]\", but Walsh has always denied this; claiming many years later that it was his idea.<ref name=Moss192-95>Moss, pages 192-195.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,189,000 domestically and $1,294,000 foreign.<ref name=\"warners\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nCritical reaction to the film was positive, and today it is considered a classic.
