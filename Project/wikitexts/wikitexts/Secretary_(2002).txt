She learns to type and applies for a job as a [[secretary]] for an eccentric yet demanding attorney, E. Edward Grey. Grey explains she is overqualified for the job (having scored higher than anyone he has ever interviewed) and that it is \"very dull work\" as they only use typewriters; Lee, however, agrees to work under these conditions.\n\nThough at first Grey appears to be highly irritated by Lee's [[Typographical error|typos]] and other mistakes, it soon becomes apparent that he is [[Sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by her obedient behavior. When Grey discovers her propensity for self-harm, he confronts her and commands that she never hurt herself again. Soon the two embark on a [[BDSM]] relationship from their typical employer-employee relationship. However, Lee experiences a sexual and personal awakening through the sadomasochistic sexual encounters with Grey, and she falls deeply in love with him. Conversely, Grey displays insecurity concerning his feelings for Lee, as well as shame and disgust over his sexual habits. During this period of exploration with Grey, Lee has also been attempting to have a more conventional boyfriend in Peter, even engaging in lukewarm sex with him. After a sexual encounter in Grey's office, Grey fires Lee.\n\nPeter then proposes to Lee, who reluctantly agrees to marry him. However, while trying on her wedding gown, she leaves and runs to Grey's office to declare her love for him. Grey, still uncertain about their relationship, tests Lee by commanding her to sit in his chair without moving her hands or feet until he returns. Lee willingly complies, despite being forced to [[Omorashi|wet her dress]] since she is not allowed to use the toilet. Hours pass, as several family members and acquaintances individually visit Lee to alternately attempt to dissuade or encourage her while Grey watches from afar, completely taken by Lee's compliance. Her refusal to leave the office draws the attention of the media, which they believe to be a [[hunger strike]]. Three days later, Grey returns to the office and takes Lee to a room upstairs where he bathes and feeds her. The pair marry and happily continue their dominant\u2013submissive relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Lee Holloway, a submissive secretary\n* [[James Spader]] as E.

Lines of dialogue were changed; Lee's statement \"I'm so stupid\" became the fantasy-sequence cry \"I'm your secretary\", which the director thought far more \"celebratory\".<ref name=\"Shainberg, Steven 2004\">Shainberg, Steven (2004), audio commentary to ''Secretary''.</ref> Additionally, the ending of the story was changed to give a more positive outcome to the relationship. Steven Shainberg stated that he wished to show that BDSM relationships can be normal and was inspired by the film ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'', which he feels normalized gay relationships for audiences in the 1980s.<ref>Shainberg, Steven, Andrew Fierberg, Amy Hobby, Erin Cressida Wilson, James Spader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jeremy Davies, et al. 2003. (''Secretary'') \"Behind the Secretary\". [United States]: Studio Home Entertainment.</ref>\n\nA central component to the film, the office spaces of Edward and Lee, took form after two years of planning by Shainberg and production designer Amy Danger, who had collaborated with Shainberg on several projects.<ref name=\"Calhoun\">John Calhoun. (2002, October). Spank You Very Much. Entertainment Design, 36(10), 8-10. Retrieved April 1, 2011, from Research Library Core. (Document ID: 204894041).</ref> The desire to have the office feel homemade and express Edward's interest in the growing of plants led Danger to juxtapose a natural decor in the office with a predominantly artificial outside world.<ref name=\"Calhoun\"/> Speaking of her choices, Danger compares the office with the rest of the film's locations: \"All the materials I used [in the office] were natural: natural wood, bamboo, ironwork ... If I wasn't using natural materials, it was natural colors, like [in] the botanical wallpaper.\"  In contrast, \"everything [in the larger world] was fake ... I covered Lee's house in plastic sheeting, and used artificial, manufactured colors.\"<ref name=\"Calhoun\"/>\nAlthough the interior sets were carefully constructed, the filmmakers did face some location-related challenges. Notably, in one instance the filmmakers accidentally obtained shooting rights for the wrong park. Gyllenhaal encouraged them to hastily shoot the required park scene anyway, without permission, while crew members distracted the local police.<ref name=\"Shainberg, Steven 2004\"/>\n\nSpeaking about ''Secretary''{{'}}s tone and atmosphere, Danger says \"With this S&M material, we could go into a dark place... Steve and I wanted the total opposite: that the nature of this relationship freed [the characters] to be their natural selves.\"<ref name=\"Calhoun\"/> Because of this atmosphere, Danger says \"Everybody kept saying, 'When are we going back to the office?' It was funny, because the rooms weren't any smaller in the house, and it wasn't any more difficult to shoot. It was because you wanted to be in that space.\"<ref name=\"Calhoun\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nDespite being set in [[Florida]], filming took place in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Secretary (2002) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/locations|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Secretary (2002) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/trivia|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe film was initially screened at several 2002 film festivals and had its domestic theatrical release on September 20, 2002, and in various foreign markets in 2003 and 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/releaseinfo|title=Secretary (2002 film)|website=IMDB|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film's [[DVD region code|region 1]] [[DVD]] was released on April 1, 2003.
