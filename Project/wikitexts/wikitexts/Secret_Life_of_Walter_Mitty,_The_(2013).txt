He chronically daydreams and has a secret crush on Cheryl Melhoff, a coworker. Walter attempts to contact Cheryl via [[eHarmony]] but eHarmony customer service agent Todd Mahar explains that Walter's account is not fully filled out: the \"been there\" and \"done that\" sections are blank.\n\nWalter works with legendary photojournalist Sean O'Connell, although they have never met in person. At work later that day, Walter receives \na negative roll from Sean with a wallet as a gift in appreciation of Walter's work over the years. A letter from Sean explains that he believes negative #25 captures the \"quintessence of ''Life''{{-\"}} and should be used for the cover of the [[Life (magazine)#1978 monthly (1978\u20132000)|magazine's final print issue]] before it becomes exclusively digital, yet the negative is missing from the roll. Ted Hendricks, the obnoxious manager of the magazine's transition, has also heard Sean's recommendation. When he asks about #25, Walter stalls and lies, worried about being fired. Walter then asks Cheryl for help, and she suggests that Walter use the other negatives as clues to Sean's location. He and Hernando, his understudy, are stumped by a negative depicting a curve, until they notice another containing the name of a ship registered in Greenland. Walter reluctantly takes a plane there.\n\nA bartender in [[Nuuk]] explains that Sean left on a ship. To find him, Mitty would need to go on the postal helicopter, and the pilot is drunk. Mitty recognizes the pilot's thumb from one of the negatives, and after hesitating, joins the pilot on a trip to bring supplies to the ship. Walter accidentally jumps into ice-cold, shark-infested waters, losing the ship's supplies and preventing radio communication when he finally comes aboard. There, Walter learns that Sean departed the ship a few days earlier, and deduces from notes on wrapping paper for a clementine cake Sean left behind that he is heading to Iceland to photograph the volcano [[Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull]]. Walter bikes, skateboards, and runs through the Icelandic countryside to find Sean, but just misses him as the volcano erupts. Dejected, he returns home.\n\nTed assumes that Walter misplaced the negative and fires him. He tries to visit Cheryl, but spots her ex-husband and leaves before talking to her. Walter visits his mother and throws away the wallet from Sean. To his surprise, Walter recognizes the curve of the piano in his mother's house while looking at the last negative. When asked, she tells Walter that she met Sean and baked him the clementine cake. She had told Walter earlier, but he was daydreaming.\n\nWalter figures out from the notes that Sean is in the Afghan [[Himalayas]], and finds him photographing a rare [[snow leopard]]. When asked about the negative, Sean explains that, attempting to be playful, he had placed the negative in the wallet. He decides not to tell Walter what the picture actually depicts. When Walter returns to America, the airport security at [[Los Angeles]] detains him for arriving from Afghanistan. To verify his identity, Walter calls the only person he knows in Los Angeles: Todd, who has kept in contact during Mitty's travels. The two chat and Todd expresses admiration for how adventurous Walter appears.\n\nWalter receives the wallet from his mother, who had retrieved it from the trash, and finally obtains the negative but chooses not to see it. Emboldened, he delivers it to ''Life''{{'}}s offices, and berates Hendricks for disrespecting the staff that made the magazine so honored.\n\nWalter reunites with Cheryl, and thanks her for inspiring him on his journey. Cheryl eagerly asks about his adventures and tells him that her ex-husband had only been at her house to help with repairs. Walking along the street, they see the final print issue on sale at a newsstand, and on its cover they see the photograph from #25 for the first time: it shows Walter sitting outside of the ''Life'' building, examining a [[contact sheet]]; the magazine is dedicated to ''Life''{{'}}s staff. Walter and Cheryl continue their walk holding hands.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig - 10975703343.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Stiller]] and [[Kristen Wiig]] at an event promoting the film in 2013]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as [[Walter Mitty]], a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] asset manager at ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Cheryl Melhoff, Walter's love interest and co-worker\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Edna Mitty, Walter's mother\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Ted Hendricks, Managing Director of the 'Transition' to Life Online\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Odessa Mitty, Walter's sister\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Todd Maher, an [[eHarmony]] customer service representative\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Hernando, Walter's understudy and co-worker\n* [[\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson]] as a drunken Greenlandic helicopter pilot\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Sean O'Connell, a photojournalist\n* [[Jon Daly (comedian)|Jon Daly]] as Tim Naughton, one of Walter's co-workers\n* Terence Bernie Hines as Gary Mannheim, one of Walter's co-workers\n* Marcus Antturi as Rich Melhoff, Cheryl's son\n* Kai Lennox as Phil Melhoff, Cheryl's ex-husband\n* [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself\n* [[Andy Richter]] as himself\n* [[Joey Slotnick]] as a retirement home administrator\n* [[Radio Man]] as himself, a Newsstand operator\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nProducer [[Samuel Goldwyn, Jr.]], whose [[Samuel Goldwyn|father]] produced the [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|1947 film adaptation]], conceived the idea of doing a [[remake]] in 1994; he had [[Jim Carrey]] in mind for the title role.
