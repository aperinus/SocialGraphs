The film's screenwriter [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]] adapted his [[Millions (novel)|novel]] while the film was in the process of being made. The novel was subsequently awarded the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story of Damian ([[Alex Etel]]), a 9-year-old [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school boy, whose family moves to the suburbs of [[Widnes]] after the death of his mother. Soon after the move, Damian whilst playing in a cardboard box by the train tracks, is disturbed by a bag of money flung from a passing train. Damian immediately shows the money to his brother, 12-year-old Anthony (Lewis Owen McGibbon), and the two begin thinking of what to do with it. Anthony wants the money all to himself, but Damian, kind-hearted, religious, and inspired by a lecture at school, looks for ways to give his share of the money to the poor.\n\nThroughout the story, Damian commits small acts of kindness, such as buying birds from pet stores and setting them free, and taking beggars to [[Pizza Hut]]. On the other hand, Anthony bribes other kids at school into being his transport and bodyguards, and looks into investing the money in real estate.\n\nThe story takes place in the weeks leading up to [[Bank of England|The Bank of England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]'s fictionalized [[United Kingdom and the euro|change from the pound (\u00a3) to the euro (\u20ac)]], an event publicized as \"\u20ac Day\". An assembly is held at Damian's school to inform the children about the change, as well as to educate them about helping the poor. Realizing that the money, which is in pounds, will be no good after a few days, Damian decides that it would be best to give it away before the conversion. He drops \u00a31,000 into the donation can at the assembly. The woman collecting the money, Dorothy ([[Daisy Donovan]]), reports Damian to the principal. Anthony lies that he and Damian stole the money from missionaries. Damian and Anthony are grounded that night. When their father collects them from school he chats with Dorothy, and there is an obvious attraction between them.\n\nAfter the donation, Anthony's friend informs them that a train carrying banknotes, which were to be destroyed after the conversion, had been robbed. One bag was stolen in a diversion, the robbers then distracted the police before escaping into a crowd of football fans. However, a robber remained on the train disguised as one of the emergency staff, and the money had been dispersed by throwing it off of the train at various locations throughout the country, to be collected by other robbers. The boys logically conclude that their money was stolen, and Damian, who thought the money was from God, feels terrible.\n\nAround this time, a mysterious man comes snooping around the train tracks, and asks Damian if he has any money. Damian thinks that the man is a beggar and tells him he has \"loads of money\". However, a suspicious Anthony gives the man a jar full of coins to cover Damian's tracks.\n\nThe man is one of the robbers looking for the bag. He eventually finds out where Damian lives and ransacks the house. Damian had informed his father about the money just before they came home to their destroyed house. The robber who came sneaking around hid in Damian's room after ransacking it, much in the way the original robbery was carried out. Damian's father, who had resolved to give the money back, decided that if the robbers were going to steal his family's Christmas, then he would steal the robbers' money. The family, as well as Dorothy, go on a massive shopping spree on Christmas Eve.\n\nThat night, after they are asleep, their house is bombarded by beggars and charities begging for contributions and, seeing the confusion that ensues, Damian runs off to the train tracks to burn the money, deciding that it was doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, the robber sneaks through the backdoor and is arrested by the police. While Damian was burning the money, he is visited by his dead mother, who tells him not to worry about her.\n\nIn the final scene, the audience sees Damian's dream of the family flying a rocket ship to [[Africa]] and helping develop water wells, while Damian narrates over the scene that each family member but him had hidden a little bit of the money beforehand. Damian convinced them to spend this money on the wells he is dreaming about. Earlier in the movie that was shown to be the cheapest way to drastically improve the quality of life for many African communities.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alex Etel]] as Damian Cunningham\n* Lewis Owen McGibbon as Anthony Cunningham\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as Ronald Cunningham\n* [[Daisy Donovan]] as Dorothy\n* [[Christopher Fulford]] as The \"Poor Man\"\n* [[Pearce Quigley]] as Community Policeman\n* Jane Hogarth as Maureen\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as [[Saint Peter]]\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]\n* Nasser Memarzia as [[Saint Joseph]]\n* [[Kathryn Pogson]] as [[Saint Clare of Assisi]]\n* Harry Kirkham as [[Saint Nicholas]]\n* [[Cornelius Macarthy]] as [[Uganda Martyrs|Gonzaga]]\n* Kolade Agboke as [[Uganda Martyrs|Ambrosio]]\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\nIn a 2014 interview, Boyle stated that, had he and Cottrell-Boyce been more confident, they would have made the film as a musical, with the characters singing and dancing.

As Harry Forbes wrote, \"The film contains a couple of mildly crude expressions, some intense episodes of menace, a momentary sexual situation, religious stereotyping, and a brief scene where the brothers look, with boyish curiosity, at a web site for women's bras on a computer.\"  As such, he explained, \"the [[USCCB]] Office for Film & Broadcasting classification is A-II \u2013 adults and adolescents.\"<ref name=\"CNS\" />\n\nJohnathan Wooten of ''Christian Spotlight on Entertainment'' downplayed the significance, saying, \"Those concerned about objectionable content will not find much to offend here though. There is very little violence (a short robbery scene, a very brief moment of a child in peril). Sexual content includes a glimpse of an unmarried couple in bed together as well as pre-pubescent boy viewing an Internet lingerie ad. When played out the latter scene actually has a strange wholesomeness to it considering his other viewing options. The only profanity is some mild British slang.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Wooten|url=http://christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/2005/millions2004.html|title=Millions|accessdate=26 April 2007|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film premiered at the 2004 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 14 September 2004.\n\n'''2005 [[British Independent Film Awards]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/British_Independent_Film_Awards/2005|title=British Independent Film Awards \u2013 2005|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008124918/http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/British_Independent_Film_Awards/2005|archivedate=8 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Won, Best Screenplay: [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]]\n*Nominated, Most Promising Newcomer: Alex Etel\n\n'''2006 [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association_Awards/2006|title=Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards \u2013 2006|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217210423/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association_Awards/2006|archivedate=17 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Nominated, Best Young Actor: Alex Etel\n\n'''2005 [[Emden International Film Festival]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Emden_International_Film_Festival/|title=Emden International Film Festival \u2013 2005|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120192054/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Emden_International_Film_Festival/|archivedate=20 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Nominated, Emden Film Award: Danny Boyle\n\n'''2005 [[Golden Trailer Awards]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Trailer_Awards/2005|title=Golden Trailer Awards \u2013 2005|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704002853/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Trailer_Awards/2005|archivedate=4 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Nominated, Best Animation/Family\n*Nominated, Best Foreign Independent Film\n\n'''2005 [[Humanitas Prize]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Humanitas_Prize/2005|title=Humanitas Prize \u2013 2005|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216053246/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Humanitas_Prize/2005|archivedate=16 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Nominated, Best [[Northwest Boychoir|Film]]\n\n'''2005 [[Phoenix Film Critics Association]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.altfg.com/awards/2005/phoenix.htm|title=Phoenix Film Critics Association Awards \u2013 2005|accessdate=19 October 2007}}</ref>\n*Won, Best Live Action Family Film\n\n'''2006 [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films|Saturn Awards]]'''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_of_Science_Fiction_Fantasy_And_Horror_Films_USA/2006|title=Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA \u2013 2006|accessdate=19 October 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016093531/http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_of_Science_Fiction_Fantasy_And_Horror_Films_USA/2006|archivedate=16 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*Nominated, Best Performance by a Younger Actor: Alex Etel\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* The song playing in the flashback to the train robbery is \"[[Hysteria (Muse song)|Hysteria]]\" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and, shortly after, another [[Muse (band)|Muse]] song is played, \"[[Blackout (Muse song)|Blackout]]\".
