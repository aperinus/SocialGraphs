It was directed by Leila Conners Petersen and Nadia Conners and financed by Adam Lewis and Pierre Andr\u00e9 Senizergues, and distributed by [[Warner Independent Pictures]].\n\nIts world premiere was at the 2007 60th Annual [[Cannes Film Festival]] (May 16\u201327, 2007) and it was released on August 17, 2007, in the year in which the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[United Nations]] global warming panel [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] was published and about a year after [[Al Gore]]'s ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', another [[feature film|film]] [[documentary film|documentary]] about [[global warming]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nWith contributions from over 50 politicians, scientists, and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] activists, including former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]], journalist Armand Betscher, and [[Paul Hawken]], the film documents the grave problems facing the planet's life systems. Global warming, [[deforestation]], [[Holocene extinction|mass species extinction]], and depletion of the oceans' habitats are all addressed. The film's premise is that the future of humanity is in jeopardy.\n\nThe film proposes potential solutions to these problems by calling for restorative action by the reshaping and rethinking of global human activity through technology, [[social responsibility]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]].\n\n==Quotes==\n{{blockquote|Global warming is not only the number 1 environmental challenge we face today, but one of the most important issues facing all of humanity ...

The role of humans in the destruction of the environment is explained from the viewpoint of several different professional fields including environmental scientists, oceanographers, economic historians, and medical specialists. The many experts called upon in this documentary demonstrate a consensus concerning human-caused climate change, and the many other impacts of industrialization such as [[Holocene extinction|the dramatic loss]] of species ([[biodiversity]]).\n\n==Critical response==\nIn March 2008 ''The 11th Hour'' was awarded the Earthwatch Environmental Film Award at National Geographic in Washington, DC.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phFIswh6KGw\n| title= The 11th Hour panel @ National Geographic & Earthwatch Film Awards\n| work = [[Earthwatch Institute]]\n| publisher = [[YouTube]]\n| accessdate = March 21, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nThe film received generally favorable reviews from critics, with a 67% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 94 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Well-researched and swimming in scientific data, this global warming documentary offers some practical and wide-ranging solutions to our climate crisis.\"<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/11th_hour\n| title=The 11th Hour\n| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n| publisher = [[Fandango Media|Fandango]]\n| accessdate = September 3, 2022\n}}</ref>\nIt has an average score of 63% on [[Metacritic]] based on 30 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-11th-hour\n| title= The 11th Hour (2007) Reviews\n| publisher = [[Red Ventures]]\n| work = [[Metacritic]]\n| accessdate = September 3, 2022\n}}</ref>\n\nKevin Crust, a critic from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', rated the film highly:\n{{blockquote|The [film] asks why these things are happening and apportions blame in varying degrees to governmental indifference tied to its allegiance to a corporate economy that is addicted to growth at any cost and perhaps, most insinuating of all, to the culture of consumerism. Disposable has trumped sustainable in our society, and we're now paying the price.\n\nThankfully for audiences, \"11th Hour\" is not without hope. The filmmakers save the most exhilarating portion for last when they ask what's being done about the problems. Experts extol existing technologies and projects as attainable solutions. Progressive designs such as a carbon-neutral city and self-sustaining buildings already offer ideas for a new direction. By mimicking nature's own blueprints, it is possible to create a system of living that heals rather than depletes the Earth.|Kevin Crust|<ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-hour17aug17,0,2830729.story?coll=cl-mreview \"The 11th Hour.\" Aug. 17, 2007, L.A.
