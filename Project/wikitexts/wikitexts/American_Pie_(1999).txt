It is the first film in the [[American Pie (series)#Theatrical films|''American Pie'' theatrical series]] and stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Jason Biggs]], [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Shannon Elizabeth]] and [[Jennifer Coolidge]]. The plot centers on five classmates (Jim, Kevin, Oz, Finch, and Stifler) who attend East Great Falls High. With the sole exception of Stifler, who has already lost his virginity, the youths make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation.\n\nThe title refers to a scene in which the protagonist is caught [[Masturbation|masturbating]] with a pie after being told that [[Baseball metaphors for sex|third base]] feels like \"warm apple pie\". Writer Adam Herz has stated that the title also refers to the quest of losing one's virginity in high school, which is as \"American as apple pie.\"\n\nThe film was a box-office hit and spawned three direct sequels: ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001), ''[[American Wedding]]'' (2003), and ''[[American Reunion]]'' (2012). In August 2017, Seann William Scott said in an interview that the fourth film probably had not made enough at the domestic box office to warrant another film.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2017/08/28/seann-william-scott-talks-goon-sequel-stifler-more-american-pie-and-dude-wheres-my-car/amp/ |title= Seann William Scott Talks 'Goon' Sequel, More 'American Pie' And 'Dude, Where's My Car?' |last= Thompson |first= Simon Y. |work= Forbes |date= April 9, 2018 |access-date= August 28, 2017 |archive-date= March 27, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190327120640/https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2017/08/28/seann-william-scott-talks-goon-sequel-stifler-more-american-pie-and-dude-wheres-my-car/ |url-status= live }}</ref> In addition to the primary ''American Pie'' saga, there are five [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films bearing the title ''[[American Pie Presents (film series)|American Pie Presents]]'': ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp|Band Camp]]'' (2005), ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]'' (2006), ''[[American Pie Presents: Beta House|Beta House]]'' (2007), ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|The Book of Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[American Pie Presents: Girls' Rules|Girls' Rules]]'' (2020).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nFive high school seniors and friends from fictional East Great Falls, [[Michigan]]: Jim Levenstein, an awkward and sexually na\u00efve [[nerd]] whose dad offers him pornography and awkward sexual advice; Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher, overconfident star of the [[lacrosse]] team; Kevin Meyers, the calm leader of the group seeking to lose his virginity to his girlfriend Vicky; Paul Finch, a [[mochaccino]]-drinking sophisticate; and Steven Stifler, a popular but raucous [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]] who often throws wild parties and is the only one of the five who is not a virgin. \n\nWhen dorky classmate Sherman claims that he lost his virginity at a party hosted by Stifler, Kevin prompts Oz, Finch, and Jim to join him in making a pact. They pledge that they will lose their virginity by high school graduation.\n\nVicky accuses Kevin of wanting her only for sex so he has to repair their relationship before senior [[prom]], now the target day for the four. Kevin discovers an old book in the library that has been compiled by students giving sexual tips; he shares the information with his friends and gives Vicky [[cunnilingus]] after studying the book. Oz joins the school [[choir]] to find a girlfriend and learn about sensitivity. He soon gains the attention of choir girl Heather, who learns about Oz's reputation and breaks up with him. Jim pursues Nadia, a foreign exchange student from [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nWhen Oz tells Jim that [[Baseball metaphors for sex|third base]] feels like \"warm apple pie\", his dad discovers him having sex with a freshly baked pie in the kitchen. At school, Nadia asks Jim to help her study, and Stifler persuades Jim to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch Nadia changing clothes after coming over to study following her ballet class. Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and while sitting half-naked on his bed, masturbates to it. \n\nJim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that the webcam link has been sent to everyone on the school list. He fails to cover the webcam and he experiences [[premature ejaculation]] twice. Nadia's sponsors see the video and send her back home, leaving Jim dateless for the prom and the laughing stock of the school.\n\nJim, believing school band [[geek]] Michelle is unaware of the webcam incident, asks her to the prom. Finch pays Vicky's friend, Jessica, $200 to spread the rumor of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Stifler is turned down by a girl because she wants Finch to ask her, so he spikes Finch's mochaccino with a [[laxative]]. Stifler plays to Finch's school restroom [[mysophobia|germaphobia]] and has loud [[diarrhea]] in the girls' bathroom. He is humiliated by Stifler and a crowd of students. Oz makes the decision to leave his lacrosse championship game to join Heather for a duet performance and they reconcile.\n\nAt prom, Sherman's virginity conquest is revealed to be a lie and he urinates on himself in front of everyone in attendance. Jim becomes annoyed by Kevin's obsession to have them fulfill their pledge. At Stifler's post-prom party,  Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. She breaks up with him afterwards, believing they would drift apart when they go to college. Oz confesses the pact to Heather and renounces it. They share a romantic night together by the lake. \n\nJim learns that Michelle accepted his offer because she saw the \"Nadia incident\" and thought he was a \"sure thing\". Michelle then has aggressive sex with Jim. Finch meets and seduces Stifler's mom and they have sex on the pool table. Stifler later walks in on them and faints. The morning after the prom, the group discuss their successful pledge while eating at their favorite restaurant. Honoring his newfound sensitivity, Oz does not divulge to his friends whether or not he and Heather had sex. The friends then toast to the \"next step\".\n\nLater, Jim strips for Nadia via webcam.  He is oblivious to his father walking in, who then walks out of the room and starts dancing as he calls for his wife, getting in the mood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of American Pie characters}}\n<!-- THE CAST LIST IS ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Jim\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Oz\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Kevin\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Stifler\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Finch\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Michelle\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Sherman\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Vicky\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Jessica\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Heather\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Jim's Dad\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Nadia\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Stifler's Mom\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as English Teacher\n* [[Lawrence Pressman]] as Coach Marshall\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Jim's Mom\n* [[Christina Milian]] as Band Member\n* [[Eden Riegel]] as Sophomore Chick\n* [[John Cho]] as \"Milf\" Guy\n* [[Sasha Barrese]] as Random Cute Girl\n* [[Eric Lively]] as Albert\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Stifler's Younger Brother\n* [[Tara Subkoff]] (''uncredited'') as College girl\n* [[Chris Weitz]] (''uncredited'') as Male voice in porn film\n}}\n'''Cameos'''\n* [[Blink-182]] make a [[cameo appearance]] as the band watching Jim and Nadia during their webcast, though drummer [[Travis Barker]] is incorrectly credited as former Blink-182 drummer \"[[Scott Raynor]]\".
