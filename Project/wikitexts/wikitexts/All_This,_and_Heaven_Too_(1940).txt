Wallis]] as executive producer. The screenplay was adapted by [[Casey Robinson]] from the 1938 novel by [[Rachel Field]]. The music was by [[Max Steiner]] and the cinematography by [[Ernest Haller|Ernie Haller]]. The film stars [[Bette Davis]] and [[Charles Boyer]] with [[Barbara O'Neil]], [[Jeffrey Lynn]], [[Virginia Weidler]], [[Helen Westley]], [[Walter Hampden]], [[Henry Daniell]], [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]], [[George Coulouris]], [[Montagu Love]], [[Janet Beecher]] and [[June Lockhart]].\n\nRachel Field's novel is based on the true story of Field's great-aunt, [[Henriette Deluzy-Desportes]], a French governess who fell in love with the [[Charles de Choiseul-Praslin|Duc de Praslin]], her employer. When Praslin's [[Fran\u00e7oise, duchesse de Praslin|wife]] was murdered, Henriette was implicated. It was a real-life scandal that contributed to the political turmoil before the [[French Revolution of 1848]] which deposed France's [[Louis Philippe I]].<ref>{{cite web |title=All This, and Heaven Too (1940) - Articles - TCM.com |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/574/All-This-and-Heaven-Too/articles.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609050440/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/574/All-This-and-Heaven-Too/articles.html |archive-date=2016-06-09 |access-date=December 3, 2015 |work=Turner Classic Movies }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37793248|title=Henriette Desportes Field (1813-1875)|work=findagrave.com|access-date=December 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Souvenirs, \u00e9dition r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par Luc Monnier, Paris, Gallimard, 1942</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:All This and Heaven Too trailer.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Screenshot of [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Bette Davis]] from the film's original trailer]]\nMademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, a French woman, starts teaching at an American girls school. She is confronted by the tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story.<!-- it constitutes about what fraction of the film? -->\n\nDeluzy-Desportes is governess to the four children of the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin in Paris during the last years of the [[Orleans monarchy]]. As a result of the Duchesse's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the Duc remains with his wife for sake of their children.\n\nDeluzy-Desportes, with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the Duchess refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The Duc confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her.\n\nThe Duc de Praslin is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for his employee, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the Duc takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for Henriette, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, Pierre, a kindly old man who had warned the governess to leave the de Praslin household. With the Duc's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that Henriette solicited the murder and she is released.\n\nDeluzy-Desportes had been recommended for the teaching position \"in the land of the free\" by an American minister, Rev. Henry Field, to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that Henriette will accept.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Davis]] as [[Henriette Deluzy-Desportes]]\n* [[Charles Boyer]] as [[Charles de Choiseul-Praslin|Charles, Duke de-Praslin]]\n* [[Barbara O'Neil]] as [[Fran\u00e7oise, duchesse de Praslin|Francoise \"Fanny\" Sebastiani de-Praslin]]\n* [[June Lockhart]] as Isabelle de Choiseul-Praslin\n* [[Virginia Weidler]] as Louise de Choiseul-Praslin\n* [[Ann E.
