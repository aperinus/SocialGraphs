In 1926 at the age of seven, the owner rapes his mother, Hattie. His father, Earl, confronts him and is killed. Cecil is then taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil to be a house servant.\n\nIn 1937, at the age of 18, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master-servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a [[Washington, D.C.]], hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple have two sons: Louis and Charlie.\n\nIn 1957, Cecil is hired by the [[White House]] during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s administration. White House [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]] Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce [[School integration in the United States|school desegregation]], then his resolve to uphold the law by [[Little Rock Nine|racially integrating]] [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Arkansas]].\n\nLouis, the elder son, becomes a university student at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], although Cecil feels that the [[Deep South|South]] is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) activist [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], which leads to a [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[sit-in]] at a [[Nashville sit-ins|segregated diner]], where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into [[alcoholism]].\n\nIn 1961, after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inauguration, Louis and [[Freedom Riders|others]] are attacked by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while on a [[Freedom Riders|freedom ride]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Louis participates in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver [[Civil Rights Address|a national address]] proposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. After Kennedy is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]], his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, [[Jackie Kennedy]] gives Cecil one of the former president's [[necktie]]s.\n\nLouis participates in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Johnson also gives Cecil a [[tie bar]].\n\nIn the late 1960s, after civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]], Louis tells his family that he has joined the [[Black Panthers]]. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s plans to suppress the Black Panthers.\n\nCharlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] and eventually running for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.\n\nCecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|economic sanctions]] against Apartheid [[South Africa]], Cecil resigns.\n\nGloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against [[Apartheid in South Africa|South African apartheid]]; they are arrested and jailed together.\n\nIn 2008, Gloria dies shortly before [[Barack Obama]] [[2008 United States presidential election|is elected]] as the nation's first black president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. White House Chief Usher [[Stephen W. Rochon]] approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way and walks down the hall to the office.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Forest Whitaker by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Forest Whitaker speaking at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California.|[[Forest Whitaker]] portrays Cecil Gaines in ''The Butler'']]\n\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[Eugene Allen|Cecil Gaines]],<ref name=THRCast/> the film's main character, who dedicates his life to becoming a professional [[domestic worker]]. \n**Michael Rainey Jr. and [[Aml Ameen]] portray Cecil at ages 7 and 18.\n;Gaines' private life\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Gloria Gaines,<ref name=THRCast/> Cecil's wife.\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as Louis Gaines,<ref name=THRCast/> the Gaines' elder son. \n* [[Elijah Kelley]] as Charlie Gaines,<ref name=NYTR/> the Gaines' younger son.\n** Isaac White portrays him at age 10.\n* [[Alex Pettyfer]] as Thomas Westfall,<ref name=THRCast/> the brutal plantation owner who kills Earl after raping Hattie.\n* [[David Banner]] as Earl Gaines,<ref name=NYTR>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|title=Black Man, White House, and History|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/movies/lee-daniels-the-butler-stars-forest-whitaker.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|access-date=August 17, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 15, 2013}}</ref> Cecil's father.\n* [[Mariah Carey]] as Hattie Pearl,<ref>{{cite web | title=Lee Daniels' The Butler (2013) | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/456871/Lee-Daniels-The-Butler/cast | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130808204351/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/456871/Lee-Daniels-The-Butler/cast | url-status=dead | archive-date=August 8, 2013 | department=Movies & TV Dept. | work=[[The New York Times]] | access-date=August 8, 2013 }}</ref> Cecil's mother.\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Howard,<ref name=THRCast/> the Gaines' neighbor who romantically pursues Gloria.\n* [[Adriane Lenox]] as Gina,<ref name=NYTR/><ref name=TNYTCast/> Howard's wife.\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Carol Hammie, Louis' girlfriend.<ref name=AwC>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Terence|title=Awards Profile: The Butler|url=http://www.awardscircuit.com/2013/04/12/awards-profile-the-butler/|publisher=Awards Circuit|access-date=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Annabeth Westfall,<ref name=THRCast/> a matron on the plantation.\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as Maynard,<ref name=NYTR/><ref name=TNYTCast/> an elderly man who mentors a young Cecil and introduces him to his profession.\n\n;White House co-workers\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Carter Wilson,<ref name=THRCast/><ref name=NYTR/> the fast-talking head butler at the White House, with whom Cecil forms a close friendship. \n* [[Lenny Kravitz]] as James Holloway,<ref name=THRCast/><ref name=NYTR/> a co-worker butler of Cecil's at the White House.\n* [[Colman Domingo]] as Freddie Fallows,<ref name=NYTR/><ref name=AwC/> the White House maitre d' who hires Cecil.\n\n;White House historical figures\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Dwight D.

After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with [[Cassian Elwes]], with whom they were working on [[The Paperboy (2012 film)|''The Paperboy'']]. Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, AI Film, a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, [[Michael Finley]], and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started [[Weinstein Co.]] picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film.

While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to [[Michael Reagan]], the former president's son, \"The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all.

They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan.\" In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, Kengor said, \"Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a [[Marxist]]-[[totalitarian]] regime allied with [[Moscow]] and [[Cuba]] that would take the South African people down the same road as [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]], and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went [[Communist]]. It was devastating.
