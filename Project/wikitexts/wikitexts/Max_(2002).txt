The film explores Hitler's views which began to take shape as the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[ideology]]; while also studying the artistic and design implications of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and how their visual appeal helped hypnotize the German people. The film goes on to study the question of what could have been had Hitler been accepted as an artist. The film was the directorial debut of [[Menno Meyjes]], who also wrote the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1918, Max Rothman ([[John Cusack]]), a [[Munich]] [[art dealer]], is a [[World War I]] veteran who lost his right arm in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], effectively ending his career as a painter. He returns to [[Germany]] and opens a [[Modernism|modern art]] gallery. He is married to Nina ([[Molly Parker]]), but also has a mistress, Liselore von Peltz ([[Leelee Sobieski]]). Through a chance encounter, Rothman is approached by a young [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Noah Taylor]]), a war veteran as well, disgruntled over Germany's loss during the conflict and the country's humiliation by the signing of the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Hitler is also an aspiring painter, and wishes to have his artwork displayed.\n\nRothman comes to believe that Hitler has talent, but has failed to tap his inner potential to create great art. While Rothman is aware of his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9's [[anti-Semitism]], he feels sorry for Hitler, who had nothing to come home to after the war, and encourages him to delve deeper in his art. Despite his overall doubts about Hitler, Rothman agrees to take some of his paintings under a contractual basis.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Reichswehr]] officer [[Karl Mayr|Captain Karl Mayr]] ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), sees Hitler give an anti-Semitic speech to uninterested passerby, and encourages him to go into [[politics]] and make a career out of [[propaganda]]. During a brief conversation in an army [[barracks]], Mayr also offers to financially support Hitler by having the army pay his expenses, further enticing Hitler to join his [[national socialist]] movement, the [[German Workers' Party]].\n\nLater, Rothman begins to question Hitler's motives regarding his [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] views. During a conversation with Rothman, Hitler denies being anti-Semitic and says that, on the contrary, he grudgingly admires Jews for their \"blood purity\". He goes on to state that the [[German people]] would be better off if they did not integrate themselves with different races. Seeing Hitler's architectural sketches, with their appeal to a romanticized national greatness, Rothman realizes this is where Hitler's talent lies, and that it would be far less dangerous if confined to art galleries. Hitler is thrilled by Rothman's enthusiasm, not understanding it is partly motivated by fear of what he might become.\n\nRothman and Hitler arrange to meet that evening to discuss Hitler's future projects, and after making a violently anti-Semitic speech to a group of supporters at a rally\u2014with Mayr's backing\u2014Hitler goes to a cafe to discuss a series of new [[militaristic]] drawings with Rothman. As Rothman approaches the cafe for his meeting with Hitler, he is savagely beaten by a group of anti-Semites who had attended Hitler's rally and been incited to violence by his words. As Rothman lies dying, an angry Hitler leaves the cafe, believing that Rothman has stood him up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cusack]] as Max Rothman\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Liselore von Peltz\n* [[Molly Parker]] as Nina Rothman\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as [[Karl Mayr]]\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as [[George Grosz]]\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as David Cohn\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was written and directed by [[screenwriter]] [[Menno Meyjes]]. When Meyjes was shopping the script around [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], he first approached [[Amblin Entertainment]] for funding. As part of helping to finance the film, star John Cusack agreed to take no salary for his lead role. [[Steven Spielberg]], for whom Meyjes had produced the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-nominated script adaptation of ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]],'' told him that he felt the script was well written, but he would personally feel uncomfortable funding the film without insulting the memory of [[Holocaust]] survivors. He encouraged Meyjes to make the film, but without support from Amblin.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Filming locations included [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] and [[Budapest, Hungary]] as backdrops for early 20th century Germany.\n\n==Response==\n\n===Critical reception===\nCritics gave generally favorable reviews to the film.
