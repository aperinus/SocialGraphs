Former [[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] and [[New York City Fire Department|firefighter]] Robert Ramsey is traveling with his daughter Jennifer and her boyfriend Christian Sanders to New York, soon to be engaged. Also on board is former Navy submariner-turned-professional gambler Dylan Johns, architect Richard Nelson, widowed Maggie James and her son Conor, stowaway Elena Morales, waiter Marco Valentin, and Captain Michael Bradford.\n\nAs the passengers are enjoying a New Year's Eve party, officers on the bridge see a huge [[rogue wave]] bearing down on the ship. To survive the wave, they try to steer the ship to starboard to take the wave bow-first, but she does not turn fast enough. The wave swamps and capsizes the ship, killing the bridge officers along with many passengers and crew. In the ballroom, a badly injured Captain Bradford attempts to restore order and assures the surviving passengers that help is on the way, and tries to persuade them to stay put. Unconvinced, Dylan leads Conor, Maggie, Robert, Richard, and Valentin as they make their way towards the bow, where he believes that they will have the best chance of escaping from the capsized liner.\n\nAs they head up, they have to cross an elevator shaft, into which Valentin falls to his death before being crushed by the falling elevator. They reunite with Jennifer, Christian, Elena, and gambler Lucky Larry, who had all been in the nightclub section of the ship, and who are the only survivors out of all of the occupants in the nightclub. The group crosses a makeshift bridge across the lobby, where Lucky Larry gets crushed by an engine. The pressure from the water finally cracks the ballroom windows, drowning the occupants, including Captain Bradford. With the water rising rapidly, the group escapes through an air duct and some ballast tanks, although Elena hits her head underwater and drowns as a result.\n\nWith the ship slowly sinking, the survivors soon find themselves in a crew lounge where they find the bow section is flooded, until an explosion of the engine room lifts it out of the water. The group enters the bow thruster room and are horrified to find the thrusters still running. With their path blocked by the propellers, and knowing that the control room is submerged in water, Robert swims away to turn off the engine. He finds the \"shut off\" switch to be broken, but presses the reverse button instead, before drowning.\n\nWith the propellers now spinning in the other direction, Dylan throws an [[acetylene]] tank into it, causing an explosion that destroys the propeller, and leaving an opening for them to escape through. The group jumps out the thruster and swims to a nearby inflatable raft, and as they are getting into the raft, the ship starts to sink. As they are paddling away, the waves push the raft farther away from the sinking liner. ''Poseidon'' flips back over, and across the water, the survivors look on as she sinks stern-first deep into the ocean. After the survivors fire a flare, two helicopters and several ships arrive to rescue them, having tracked the location of the ''Poseidon'''s [[GPS]] beacon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Robert Ramsey\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Dylan J.

Pictures, Now in Production|website=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=July 5, 2005|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sets===\nAs with the 1972 ''The Poseidon Adventure'' film, which based many of its sets on rooms aboard the [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']], the film's set designers drew inspiration for some of the spaces aboard the fictional \"Poseidon\" from rooms aboard the [[RMS Queen Mary 2|''Queen Mary 2'']], most notably in ''Poseidon'''s ballroom, which is modeled on the main dining room of ''Queen Mary 2''.\n\nOn the soundstage at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank]] in [[California]], two sets for each main room were built, one right-side-up and the other upside down. The upside-down ballroom was built on top of a large water tank in the soundstage so it could be flooded and drained in a matter of hours. The interior and exterior shots of the ship rolling were constructed with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\n===Visual effects===\nThe primary [[visual effects]] were completed by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Moving Picture Company]]. ILM used the most advanced version of [[mental ray]] to photorealistically light and render the shots, and was responsible for all of the ship's exterior shots. The most complicated work was the opening shot of the ship, where the camera tours the ship's exterior. It lasts for two and a half minutes, and featured one of the most complex digital models ILM had ever created. For water simulations, proprietary software known as PhysBAM was used, created in collaboration with [[Stanford University]]. [[Harold Weed|Harold \"Howie\" Weed]] was the film's computer graphics modeler.\n\nDigital interiors and water effects were created by MPC, while liquid and gaseous effects were simulated with [[Scanline VFX]] proprietary software [[Flowline]]. Other shots were done by CIS Hollywood, with water effects simulated using [[RealFlow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/iposeidoni-making-big-cg-splash/page/1,1|title=Poseidon: Making a Big CG Splash|access-date=February 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515105055/http://www.awn.com/articles/production/iposeidoni-making-big-cg-splash/page/1,1#|archive-date=May 15, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=fxguide, LLC |url=http://www.fxguide.com/article350.html |title=maya:after effects:avid - Wipe out: 'Poseidon' Fluid Simulations |publisher=fxguide |date=May 8, 2006 |access-date=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106072542/http://www.fxguide.com/article350.html |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack was released on May 9, 2006, and includes music composed by [[Klaus Badelt]], as well as songs performed by [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], who played the character Gloria in the film, and by [[Federico Aubele]].\n\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Performed by\n| title1          = Won't Let You Fall\n| extra1          = [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]\n| length1         = 4:39\n| title2          = Bailamos\n| extra2          = [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]\n| length2         = 3:10\n| title3          = Postales\n| extra3          = [[Federico Aubele]]\n| length3         = 4:09\n| title4          = The Poseidon\n| extra4          = [[Klaus Badelt]]\n| length4         = 3:19\n| title5          = The Wave\n| extra5          = Klaus Badelt\n| length5         = 4:37\n| title6          = A Map and a Plan\n| extra6          = Klaus Badelt\n| length6         = 2:30\n| title7          = Fire Dive\n| extra7          = Klaus Badelt\n| length7         = 2:48\n| title8          = Claustrophobia\n| extra8          = Klaus Badelt\n| length8         = 7:09\n| title9          = Drowning\n| extra9          = Klaus Badelt\n| length9         = 3:05\n| title10         = Don't Look Down\n| extra10         = Klaus Badelt\n| length10        = 3:44\n| title11         = Escape\n| extra11         = Klaus Badelt\n| length11        = 2:42\n}}\n\n''[[Be Without You|Be Without You (Moto Blanco Vocal Mix)]]'' (8:44) by [[Mary J.
