It is a [[remake]] of [[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|the 1970 film of the same name]] written by [[Neil Simon]] and starring [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Sandy Dennis]].\n\n==Plot==\nHenry and Nancy Clark are a couple living in a quiet Ohio town. Married for 27 years, their last child has left home and Nancy is suffering from [[empty nest syndrome]]. Unbeknownst to her, Henry has lost his job due to corporate downsizing and has an interview in New York. Nancy sneaks on the plane with him and they begin a disastrous series of misadventures. Their plane is rerouted to Boston, their luggage is lost, they are mugged at gunpoint and their daughter has used their credit card to the point where it has reached its limit. They are thrown out of their hotel by a pompous manager named Mersault who also indulges in secretly cross dressing using guests' clothing. Forced to live by their wits on the street, the couple find themselves caught up in a robbery and chased by the police through [[Central Park]]. In the end, Henry aces his job interview and the two begin a new life together in New York City. Henry and Nancy (as well as Mersault openly in full-drag) go to see their daughter perform on Broadway.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Steve Martin]] as Henry Clark\n*[[Goldie Hawn]] as Nancy Clark\n*[[Mark McKinney]] as Greg\n*[[Oliver Hudson]] as Alan Clark\n*[[John Cleese]] as Mr. Mersault\n\n==Production==\nSteve Martin and Goldie Hawn first worked together in ''[[Housesitter]]'' (1992).\n\nHenry and Nancy Clark's son Alan is played by Goldie Hawn's real-life son, [[Oliver Hudson]].\n\nMuch footage from the film was reportedly stolen, which resulted in many scenes having to be reshot.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Out-of-Towners'' was a disappointment critically and commercially. It has a 26% rating on the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] website from 38 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Solid source material and a cast of talented comedians aren't enough to make ''The Out-of-Towners'' worth hosting on a screen of any size.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087047-outoftowners/ |title=The Out-Of-Towners Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2011-01-12}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] commented that the movie \"was not a proud moment in the often-inspired careers of Martin and Hawn.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990402/REVIEWS/904020302/1023 |title=The Out-Of-Towners :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 1999-04-02|access-date=2011-01-12}}</ref> Most of the negative reviews point to Cleese as the only redeeming factor of the film.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1999]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0129280}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|the_out_of_towners}}\n*[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=out-of-towners.htm ''The Out-of-Towners''] at [[Box Office Mojo]]\n\n{{Sam Weisman}}\n{{Marc Lawrence}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Out-of-Towners}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Neil Simon]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sam Weisman]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Marc Lawrence]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Evans]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Marc Shaiman]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
