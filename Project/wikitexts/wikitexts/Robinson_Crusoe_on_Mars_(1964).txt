It is a science fiction retelling of the classic 1719 novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' by [[Daniel Defoe]]. The film was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and filmed in [[Technicolor]] and [[Techniscope]].\n\n==Plot==\nCommander Christopher \"Kit\" Draper, [[United States Navy|USN]], and Colonel Dan McReady, [[United States Air Force|USAF]], reach the red planet in their spaceship, Mars Gravity Probe 1. They are forced to use up their remaining fuel in order to avoid an imminent collision with a large orbiting [[meteoroid]]; they descend in their one-man lifeboat pods, becoming the first humans on Mars.\n\nDraper eventually finds a cave for shelter. He figures out how to obtain the rest of what he needs to survive: he burns some coal-like rocks for warmth and discovers that heating them also releases oxygen. This allows him to refill his air tanks with a hand pump and to move around in the thin Martian atmosphere. On one of his excursions, he finds McReady's crashed pod and corpse.\n\nHe also finds their monkey Mona alive. Later, he notices that Mona keeps disappearing and is uninterested in their dwindling supply of food and water. He gives her a salty cracker, but no water. When Mona gets thirsty, he lets her out and follows her to a cave where he finds a pool of water in which edible plant \"sausages\" grow.\n\nAs the days grow into months, Draper slowly begins to crack from the prolonged isolation, at one point imagining an alive, but unspeaking, McReady appearing. He also watches helplessly as his mothership, an inaccessible \"supermarket\", periodically orbits overhead; without fuel, the spaceship cannot follow his radioed order to land.\n\nWhile walking about, Draper comes upon a dark rock slab standing almost upright. Curious, he digs in the ground around it, exposing a skeletal hand and arm wearing a black bracelet. He uncovers the rest of the [[humanoid]] skeleton and determines that the alien was murdered; the front of the skull shows a hole, and the back shows heavy charring. To hide his presence on Mars, Draper signals his low-orbiting mothership to [[self-destruct]].\n\nNot long after, Draper sees a spaceship descend and land just over the horizon. Believing it might be a rescue ship from Earth, he heads towards the landing site the following morning, only to see alien spacecraft darting about in the sky. He approaches cautiously and sees human-looking slaves being used for mining by equally human-shaped captors wearing spacesuits and helmets and bearing weapons. One of the slaves escapes and runs into Draper; an alien spaceship blasts the area as the two escape. Draper notices the stranger is wearing black bracelets just like the one he found in the grave. Draper rescues the stranger and takes him back to the safety of the cave.  The aliens bombard the mine area that night and then depart.\n\nDraper names his new acquaintance \"Friday,\" after [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|the character]] in ''Robinson Crusoe.''  At first, Draper is wary of his new companion, but they gradually grow to trust and like each other.  Soon, Draper begins to teach him to speak English.  Later, when he and the stranger investigate, they find the dead bodies of the other slaves.  At that moment, the passing meteoroid initiates a strange atmospheric phenomenon: a heavy black \"snow\" that soon covers the site.  Draper is buried under the heavy material, but Friday, with his greater strength saves Draper and shares his \"air pills\", which provide oxygen.\n\nAfter a while, the alien spacecraft return, tracking Friday by his bracelets. Draper tries to remove the bracelets with a [[wire saw]]. When the aliens blast the castaways' hiding place, Draper, Friday, and Mona flee north through underground [[Martian canals]]. They eventually surface near the [[Planum Boreum|polar icecap]]. Exhausted, freezing, and nearly out of the air pills, they build a [[igloo|snow shelter]]. Draper finally manages to cut off Friday's bracelets shortly before the meteoroid crashes into the ice cap; the resulting explosion and firestorm melts the ice and snow, saving them from freezing to death.\n\nJust then, Draper detects an approaching spaceship. He fears it is the aliens, but his portable radio picks up an English-speaking voice - it is a rescue ship!  A capsule descends and the picture ends with Mars receding in the distance while the credits scroll.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Paul Mantee]] as Commander Christopher \"Kit\" Draper, USN\n* [[Victor Lundin]] as Friday\n* [[Adam West]] as Colonel Dan McReady, USAF\n* Barney the Woolly Monkey as Mona.\n\n==Production==\nExterior locations were shot mostly at [[Zabriskie Point]] in [[Death Valley National Park]], [[California]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/88481/Robinson-Crusoe-on-Mars/original-print-info.html \"Original print information: Robinson Crusoe on Mars.\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''.

I can\u2019t think of any other film I\u2019ve made, unless it was ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', where I had such complete autonomy ... that I had as much genuine pleasure and fulfillment from as ''Robinson Crusoe on Mars''. It was as fulfilling as cinematography had ever been. Everything I set out to do, I accomplished as well as one possibly could ... We made exploratory trips into Death Valley, and I conceived a key to credible verisimilitude ... I would abandon shots from the valleys, make them from up on the ridges. Death Valley had been seen in hundreds of westerns, but they were all shot from the bottoms of the canyons, because that\u2019s where horses could gallop through. On the top of these weird looking ridges of marshmallow sands, the vista was something else. It looked like another planet \u2014 certainly not Death Valley. Additionally, I conceived making the blue skies red ... It was wintertime, and the skies were deep blue.

Film reviewer Glenn Erickson opined, \"Despite laudable efforts from all concerned, the film didn't click with audiences. Indifferent distribution was blamed, but it's also likely that the public preferred to see its astronauts on the 6 O'Clock News\".<ref name=\"DVD Savant\"/>\n\n* Film historian [[Leonard Maltin]] considered ''Robinson Crusoe on Mars'', \"a surprisingly agreeable reworking of the classic Defoe story ... beautifully shot in [[Death Valley]] by Winston C.

There is also the original theatrical trailer and an audio interview with director Byron Haskin recorded in 1979. A music video for Victor Lundin's song \"Robinson Crusoe on Mars\" was created in 2007 specifically for the film's DVD release.
