In the film, a Sudanese-American former US soldier ([[Don Cheadle]]) with a background in explosives is the prime suspect in a search by an FBI Special Agent ([[Guy Pearce]]), for the bomb-maker in a string of global terror explosions aimed at civilians.\n\nThe film was released on August 27, 2008. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $27 million against its $22 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSamir Horn is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking [[Sudan]]ese-American and devout [[Muslim]]. His Sudanese father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. As an adult, Samir is first seen operating as an arms dealer. While negotiating a deal with Omar in [[Yemen]] he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends, and when Omar's people arrange an escape, they take Samir with them.  They meet Fareed, a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization.  [[FBI]] Special Agent Roy Clayton suspects Samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him.\n\nJoining al-Nathir, Samir uses the skills he learned as a [[Special Forces (United States Army)#Special Forces MOS descriptions|Special Forces Engineer Sergeant]] with the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to bomb the U.S. consulate in [[Nice]], [[France]].  It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for a U.S. intelligence contractor, Carter; Samir is devastated when he learns that despite his and Carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing.\n\nImpressed with Samir, Fareed introduces him to leader Nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during [[Thanksgiving]] and instructs Samir to act as liaison to each of the al-Nathir [[wikt:sleeper|sleeper]] bombers.  Later, Carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between Samir and Omar, and is killed by Omar.\n\nSamir reveals his deep cover to Clayton, who tracks him to [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. While investigating, Clayton also discovers the deaths in Nice were fake, save for one. While on board a cargo ship to [[Marseille, France]], Samir kills Nathir and Fareed, and tells an enraged Omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed Islam.  Samir then tells Omar that he switched the bombers' emails and placed them all on the same bus, so all of them died without victims (except for the driver of the one bus).  The Canadian police and the FBI break in, kill Omar, and injure Samir.\n\nLater, underneath the [[Chicago \"L\"|L]] in Chicago, Samir tells Clayton he feels guilty for killing innocent people, and that the [[Qur'an]] says that to kill an innocent person is to kill all mankind. Clayton responds by noting that the Qur'an also says that by saving an innocent person, he has saved all mankind, tells Samir he is a hero, and assures him of a possible career with the FBI.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Samir Horn\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as FBI agent Roy Clayton\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Omar\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as FBI agent Max Archer\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Carter\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Chandra Dawkin\n* [[Mozhan Marn\u00f2]] as Leyla\n* [[Lorena Gale]] as Dierdre Horn\n* [[Alyy Khan]] as Fareed\n* Raad Rawi as Nathir\n* [[Adeel Akhtar]] as Hamzi\n\n==Production==\nThe project had been in development since 2002 and was originally set to be produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] (through [[Touchstone Pictures]]), but was dropped owing to management change. It was picked up by [[Overture Films]]. [[Principal photography]] started in early September, 2007, in [[Toronto]], [[Marseille]], and [[Marrakech|Marrakesh]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Kit|first=Boris|title=Cheadle, Pearce go undercover|journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 11, 2007|pages=1, 18|issn=0018-3660|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3icd7a8b9fe00edd2d0d78d52add6a9ee4| accessdate=2007-07-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713180944/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3icd7a8b9fe00edd2d0d78d52add6a9ee4 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10.
