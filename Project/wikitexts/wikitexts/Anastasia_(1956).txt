Set in [[Interwar period|interwar]] France, the film follows a plot related to rumors that the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], the youngest daughter of the late [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]], survived the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]] in 1918. Russian General Bounine ([[Yul Brynner]]), former leader of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Revolution]], along with his associates plot to swindle an inheritance of \u00a310 million from the Grand Duchess using an amnesiac ([[Ingrid Bergman]]) who looks remarkably like the missing Anastasia. The exiled \u00e9migr\u00e9s of the Russian aristocracy, in particular the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]] ([[Helen Hayes]]) of Denmark, must be convinced that their handpicked claimant is legitimate if the plotters are to get her money.\n\n''Anastasia'' was adapted from a 1952 play written by [[Guy Bolton]] and [[Marcelle Maurette]]. He was inspired by the story of [[Anna Anderson]], the best known of the many [[Romanov impostors#Anastasia impostors|Anastasia impostors]] who emerged after the Imperial family were killed in July 1918.\n\n==Plot==\nThough the [[Execution of the Romanov family|last Russian Tsar and his family were executed in 1918]], rumors persisted that his youngest daughter, the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]], somehow survived. In 1928 Paris, Anna, an ailing woman resembling Anastasia, is brought to the attention of former [[White movement|White Russian]] General Bounine, now the proprietor of a successful Russian-themed nightclub. Bounine knows that while Anna was in a [[Lunatic asylum|mental asylum]] being treated for [[amnesia]], she told a nun that she was Anastasia. When approached by Bounine and addressed as the grand duchess, she refuses to have anything to do with him. She flees and tries to throw herself into the [[River Seine]], but is stopped.\n\nBounine meets with his associates Chernov and Petrovin. Bounine has already repeatedly raised funds from stockholders (eager to gain a share of \u00a310 million belonging to Anastasia held by an English bank) based on his claim that he had found Anastasia. Privately he admits it is a scam. But the stockholders have lost their patience and given him eight days to produce her.\n\nBounine arranges for Anna to be intensively trained to pass as Anastasia. During this time, she and Bounine begin to develop feelings for one another. Later, in a series of carefully arranged encounters with former familiars and members of the imperial court, Anna begins to display a confidence and style that astonish her skeptical interlocutors.\n\nAnna has to go to [[Copenhagen]], where she has to convince the highly skeptical dowager empress, Anastasia's grandmother, that she is Anastasia Romanov. Meanwhile, Bounine becomes increasingly jealous of the attentions that Prince Paul, another fortune hunter, pays to Anna. At a grand ball in Copenhagen at which Anna/Anastasia's engagement to Paul is to be announced, the dowager empress has a final private conversation with her. Although aware of Bounine's machinations, [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Marie Feodorovna]] believes that Anna is truly her granddaughter. Realizing that Anna has fallen in love with Bounine, she helps her run away with him. The empress then makes it known to those around her that Anna is not Anastasia, although it is left ambiguous if she accepts that notion.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Anastasia (1956) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|375px|L-R: [[Sacha Pito\u00ebff]], [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Akim Tamiroff]] and [[Yul Brynner]]   ]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anna Koreff / Anastasia]]\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as General Bounine\n* [[Helen Hayes]] as the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]]\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as Boris Andreevich Chernov\n* [[Martita Hunt]] as Baroness Elena von Livenbaum\n* [[Felix Aylmer]] as Chamberlain\n* [[Sacha Pito\u00ebff]] as Piotr Ivanovich Petrovin\n* [[Ivan Desny]] as Prince Paul von Haraldberg (an invented character)\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as Irina Lissemskaia\n* Gr\u00e9goire Gromoff as Stepan\n* [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]] as Mikhail Vlados\n* [[Ina De La Haye]] as Marusia\n* [[Katherine Kath]] as Maxime\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe film was adapted by [[Guy Bolton]] and [[Arthur Laurents]] from the play by Bolton and [[Marcelle Maurette]]. Some critics believed the film was bound too much to the static settings and theatrical \"scenes\" of the play, but  additional, essentially decorative, ball scenes were added to open up the action.\n\nThe film does not reveal whether Anna is the Romanov princess, but suggests through subtle hints that she is. The gradual realisation of her true identity is juxtaposed against Bounine's growing romantic interest in Anna. In one speech, he says to Anna/Anastasia that he cares for who she is and not what her name is.\n\nHayes draws from her stage experience to deliver the film's last line, summing up the motion picture's exploration of identity and role-playing. Asked how she will explain the vanishing of her supposed granddaughter to a ballroom full of expectant guests, she declares, \"I will tell them that the play is over, go home!\" The film closes with the regal figure of the Dowager Empress on the arm of Prince Paul, descending the grand staircase.\n\nThe film marked Bergman's return to working for a Hollywood studio after several years of working in [[Italy]] with her husband, [[Roberto Rossellini]]. (Their marriage had caused a scandal, as he divorced his then current wife, Marcella DeMarchis to be with her.)\n\nThe film was also a comeback for [[Helen Hayes]]. She had suspended her career for several years due to the death of her daughter Mary, and her husband's failing health.\n\n==Locations==\nThe film was shot on location in Copenhagen, London and Paris. Studio interiors were shot at [[MGM-British Studios]] at [[Borehamwood]], England.\n\nThe [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris|Alexander Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral]] in Paris, which was a center of worship for Russian aristocrats and other \u00e9migr\u00e9s from [[St. Petersburg]] in the city, is featured in one of the early scenes.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67292/Anastasia/notes.html Anastasia]</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
