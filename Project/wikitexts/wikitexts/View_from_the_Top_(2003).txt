The film follows a young woman (Paltrow) from a small town who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a [[flight attendant]].\n\n==Plot==\nDonna Jensen is from a small town in [[Nevada]]. She wants to escape her miserable, unhappy life of living in a trailer with her alcoholic mother, a former Las Vegas showgirl, and her abusive, alcoholic stepfather. After graduating high school, Donna struggles to make ends meet working as a clerk in a [[Big Lots]] store.\n\nAfter her boyfriend leaves her, Donna sees a TV interview with Sally Weston, a former flight attendant, who has written a memoir called ''My Life in the Sky''. Donna then becomes a [[flight attendant]] for a small, seedy [[California]] commuter airline called Sierra. She works with Sherry, a senior attendant, and Christine. During this time she first meets Ted. After several months, Donna applies to Royalty Airlines. Sherry and Christine also apply. While Christine and Donna get in, Sherry does not, and remains with Sierra Airlines.\n\nDonna puts her heart and soul into training, and, after meeting Sally Weston, is determined to be assigned to the top route, \"Paris, First Class, International\". After training, Donna is shocked and disappointed to be assigned to a [[Regional airline|commuter]] route in Cleveland while Christine, who struggled during the training, inexplicably has been assigned the high-priority [[New York City]] route.\n\nAlthough Donna is unhappy being in Cleveland, she meets and begins a relationship with Ted. A few months later, Donna runs into Christine in Cleveland. Donna is shocked when Christine happens to empty her handbag and it has stolen Royalty Air items. Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines and could result in termination. Donna is suspicious that there was some error in her route assignment. With Weston's help, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test I.D. numbers as they handed in their final exams to the instructor.\n\nWeston then has airline security spy on Christine's flight to see if she engages in any theft. Christine is caught and fired. Donna re-takes the exam, achieving a perfect score. She is then assigned to a Paris, First Class, International route, though it means breaking off her relationship with Ted.\n\nDonna soon realizes that she is lonely and unhappy and misses Ted. With Weston's encouragement, she returns to Cleveland and the two reconcile. The film ends with Donna wishing her passengers well as they land in Cleveland, though she is now a pilot.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Donna\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Christine\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Ted\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Sally Weston\n* [[Joshua Malina]] as Randy\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Sherry\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Pilot Steve\n* [[Mike Myers]] as John Whitney\n* [[Marc Blucas]] as Tommy Boulay\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Angela\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Roy Roby\n* [[Concetta Tomei]] as Mrs. Stewart\n* Robyn Peterson as Donna's Mom\n* [[Nadia Dajani]] as Paige\n* [[John Francis Daley]] as Rodney\n}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = View from the Top: Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 18, 2003\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Curb Records]]\n| producer   = [[Mike Curb]], [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Performer(s)\n| total_length =\n| title1 = [[Suddenly (LeAnn Rimes song)|Suddenly]]\n| extra1 = [[LeAnn Rimes]]\n| writer1 = [[Andreas Carlsson]], [[Desmond Child]]\n| length1 = 4:00\n\n| title2 = No Sign of It\n| note2 = Humberto Gatica radio edit\n| extra2 = [[Natalie Grant]]\n| writer2 = [[Scott Cutler]], [[Anne Preven]]\n| length2 = 4:03\n\n| title3 = [[Was That My Life]]\n| extra3 = [[Jo Dee Messina]]\n| writer3 = [[Marv Green]], Bill Luther\n| length3 = 3:49\n\n| title4 = I'm Not Anybody's Girl\n| extra4 = [[Kaci Battaglia|Kaci]]\n| writer4 = Jason Levine, Jay McCollum\n| length4 = 3:13\n\n| title5 = I've Been Waiting\n| extra5 = [[Sixpence None the Richer]]\n| writer5 = [[Matt Slocum]]\n| length5 = 4:18\n\n| title6 = Boys Don't Cry\n| extra6 = [[Plumb (singer)|Plumb]]\n| writer6 = [[Plumb (singer)|Tiffany Arbuckle Lee]], [[Matt Bronleewe]]\n| length6 = 3:48\n\n| title7 = Utopia\n| extra7 = Sofia Loell\n| writer7 = Johan Gl\u00f6ssner, Sofia Loell\n| length7 = 3:42\n\n| title8 = Circle of Love\n| extra8 = [[Tamara Walker]]\n| writer8 = Del Harley, Allan Koppelberger, [[Laurie Webb]]\n| length8 = 3:41\n\n| title9 = The Bus Ride\n| extra9 = Anna Wilson\n| writer9 = [[Gary Burr]], [[Matt Rollings]], Anna Wilson\n| length9 = 3:54\n\n| title10 = [[Sincerely (song)|Sincerely]]\n| extra10 = G.G.\n| writer10 = [[Alan Freed]], [[Harvey Fuqua]]\n| length10 = 3:15\n\n| title11 = [[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\n| extra11 = Katie Cook\n| writer11 = [[Rob Hyman]], [[Cyndi Lauper]]\n| length11 = 4:04\n\n| title12 = Everywhere I Look, There's You\n| extra12 = Tamara Walker\n| writer12 = Michael Behymer, [[Mike Curb]], [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n| length12 = 3:57\n}}\n;
