Minnelli's specialty was in directing the kind of glossy musicals that M-G-M's [[Arthur Freed|Arthur Freed unit]] turned out.  Because he trusted producer [[Pandro S. Berman]]'s judgement in regard to the film's star, Katharine Hepburn &ndash; who had already signed on to do the film &ndash; Minnelli accepted the assignment; Berman had produced ''[[Alice Adams (1935 film)|Alice Adams]]'' and ''[[Stage Door]]'' with Hepburn when they both worked for [[RKO Pictures]]. Berman and Minnelli would go on to make ''[[Madame Bovary (1949 film)|Madame Bovary]]'' (1949), ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950), and other successful films together.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] paid [[David O. Selznick]] $25,000<ref name=\"afi\"/> and [[RKO]] $75,000<ref name=\":0\" /> for the use of [[Robert Mitchum]]. Mitchum was working on two other films at the same time, ''[[Desire Me]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Locket]]'' (1946), which prompted director Vincente Minnelli to wonder if that was how Mitchum maintained his sleepy-eyed look.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHepburn was opinionated about her colleagues.  She wasn't impressed by Mitchum, an opinion she did not hide, and, at least at first, was not happy about Minnelli being the director of the film. Hepburn's self-assurance made Minnelli nervous, but the two grew to be good friends, a fact which annoyed Robert Taylor, who was afraid that the film would become a showcase for Hepburn.  He changed his mind, though, after realizing that Minnelli's direction was helping to improve his performance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe musical motif featured in the film is an excerpt from [[Johannes Brahms]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 3]]''.<ref name=afi />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine lauded the film and wrote, \"''Undercurrent'' is heavy drama with ''femme'' appeal...Hepburn sells her role with usual finesse and talent. Robert Mitchum, as the missing brother, has only three scenes, but makes them count for importance.\"<ref>Staff (1946) [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796004.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=Undercurrent review] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Last accessed: March 29, 2008.</ref>\n\nCritic [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also liked the film and wrote, \"However, that is ''Undercurrent''-\u2014and you must take it upon its own terms, which are those of theatrical dogmatism, if you hope to endure it at all. If you do, you may find it gratifying principally because Miss Hepburn gives a crisp and taut performance of a lady overcome by mounting fears and Mr. Taylor, back in films from his war service, accelerates a brooding meanness as her spouse. You may also find Robert Mitchum fairly appealing in a crumpled, modest way as the culturally oriented brother, even though he appears in only a couple of scenes. And you may like Edmund Gwenn and Jayne Meadows, among others, in minor roles.\"<ref>[[Bosley Crowther|Crowther, Bosley]] (November 29, 1946) [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9F0CE1D7103BE433A2575AC2A9679D946793D6CF&oref=slogin review] ''[[The New York Times]]''. Last accessed: March 29, 2008.</ref>\n\nMore recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \"Director Vincente Minnelli...known mostly through his upbeat MGM musicals, changes direction with this tearjerker'' femme'' appealing romantic melodrama, that can also be viewed as a heavy going psychological film noir (at least, stylishly noir through the brilliantly dark photography of Karl Freund)...Though overlong and filled with too many misleading clues about which brother is the baddie, the acting is superb, even though both Katharine Hepburn and Robert Mitchum are cast against type (a weak woman and a sensitive man).
