When he finds out that his master, Senex's handsome but dim son Hero, has fallen in love with the beautiful Philia (destined to be a courtesan) from the house of Marcus Lycus, next door, Pseudolus makes a deal: he will get the girl for Hero in return for his freedom.\n\nUnfortunately, the virgin has been sold to the great Roman soldier [[Miles Gloriosus]], who even now is on his way from conquering Crete to claim her as his bride. In an attempt to fake out the great Gloriosus and buy enough time to come up with a plan that will give Philia to Hero, Pseudolus and his overseer, Hysterium, stage a sit-down orgy for fourteen. Pseudolus informs the captain that his bride is dead and blackmails Hysterium into masquerading as the corpse of Philia to fool the captain and send him heartbroken away; but things go wrong at every turn.\n\nWhen the supposedly dead \"Philia\" suddenly comes back to life after the great Gloriosus announces his intention of cutting \"her\" heart out as a memorial, a chase across Rome and on into the countryside ensues. Eventually, Miles Gloriosus collars Hero, the real Philia, Hysterium, Marcus Lycus, Pseudolus, and Gymnasia, the silent courtesan fancied by Pseudolus, and brings them back to Rome to untangle the skein of deception and see that justice is done.\n\nIn the end Hero gets Philia; Senex's next-door neighbor Erronius learns that Philia and Miles Gloriosus are in fact his long-lost children; Marcus Lycus is spared from execution for breaking a marriage contract; Miles Gloriosus takes the gorgeous Gemini twins as his consorts; and Pseudolus gets his freedom, the beautiful and Amazonian Gymnasia to be his wife, and a dowry of 10,000 minae, compliments of Marcus Lycus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Zero Mostel]] as [[Pseudolus]]\n* [[Phil Silvers]] as Marcus Lycus\n* [[Buster Keaton]] as Erronius\n* [[Jack Gilford]] as Hysterium\n* [[Michael Crawford]] as Hero\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Senex]]\n* [[Annette Andre]] as Philia\n* [[Patricia Jessel]] as Domina\n* [[Leon Greene]] as Captain [[Miles Gloriosus]]\n* [[Pamela Brown (actress)|Pamela Brown]] as High Priestess\n* Inga Nielsen as Gymnasia\n* [[Beatrix Lehmann]] as Domina's mother\n* [[Alfie Bass]] as Gatekeeper\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Gladiator instructor\n* [[Bill Kerr]] as Gladiator-in-Training\n* Lucienne Bridou as Panacea\n* Helen Funai as Tintinabula\n* [[Jon Pertwee]] as Crassus\n* [[Janet Webb]] as Fertilla\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] as Sentry\n* [[Frank Thornton]] as Slave driver\n* [[Ingrid Pitt]] as Courtesan\n}}\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* Veteran comedian Keaton was terminally ill with cancer at the time of filming.

He had originally played Lycus in the 1963 [[West End theatre|West End]] stage production.\n* Kinnear appeared in eight other films directed by [[Richard Lester]]: ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), ''[[How I Won the War]]'' (1967), ''[[The Bed Sitting Room (film)|The Bed Sitting Room]]'' (1969), ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 live-action film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1973), ''[[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|The Four Musketeers]]'' (1974), ''[[Juggernaut (1974 film)|Juggernaut]]'' (1974), ''[[Royal Flash (film)|Royal Flash]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Return of the Musketeers]]'' (1989).\n\n==Songs==\n* \"Comedy Tonight\" \u2014 Pseudolus and Company\n* \"Lovely\" \u2014 Philia and Hero\n* \"Everybody Ought to Have a Maid\" \u2014 Pseudolus, Senex, Lycus, and Hysterium\n* \"Bring Me My Bride\" \u2014 Miles Gloriosus and Company\n* \"Lovely\" (reprise) \u2014 Pseudolus and Hysterium\n* \"Funeral Sequence\" \u2014 Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus and Company\n* \"Finale\" \u2014 Company\n\nSongs from the original Broadway score which were cut for the film: \"Love I Hear\" (Hero), \"Free\" (Pseudolus and Hero), \"Pretty Little Picture\" (Pseudolus, Hero, Philia), \"I'm Calm\" (Hysterium), \"Impossible\" (Senex and Hero), \"That Dirty Old Man\" (Domina) and \"That'll Show Him\" (Philia).<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2779 \"Songs\"] on the [[Internet Broadway Database]]</ref>\n\nSondheim's music was adapted for the film version of ''Forum'' by [[Ken Thorne]], who previously worked with [[The Beatles]] on ''[[Help!

Other directors who were considered included [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Mike Nichols]].<ref name=tcmarticle/> It was filmed at the [[Samuel Bronston]] Studios in [[Madrid, Spain]], and on location around that city, on an estimated budget of $2 million. Filming took place from September to November 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nJack Gilford was also re-creating his stage role, as Hysterium,<ref name=ibdb /> and there are other connections to the Broadway production.  [[Tony Walton]], who designed the production, including the costumes, was also the designer of the Broadway show.  For Walton, who was married to [[Julie Andrews]] from 1959 to 1967, ''Forum'' came at the beginning of both his film and stage careers: it was his second Broadway production, and his third film - he had designed costumes for ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' in 1964, and did the overall production design of ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' in 1966. [[Bob Simmons (stunt man)|Bob Simmons]], a renowned [[stunt coordinator]], designed and performed many of the action scenes in the film.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n''Forum'' is remarkable as one of the few films in which Buster Keaton appeared where he employed a double. Keaton was suffering from terminal cancer at the time &ndash; a fact of which he was not aware &ndash; and Mick Dillon stood-in for him for the running sequences.  However, Buster performed the pratfall after running into a tree in the chase sequence near the end of the film himself, as no one could properly imitate his pratfalls.<ref>Freese, Gene Scott (2014) ''Hollywood Stunt Performers, 1910s-1970s'' (Second Edition).
