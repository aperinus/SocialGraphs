It became the first Chinese-language movie to top the American box office, where it stayed for two consecutive weeks, and went on to earn $53.7 million in the United States and $177 million worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film]], but lost to ''[[Nowhere in Africa]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2021}}\nIn ancient China during the [[Warring States period]], Nameless, a [[Qin (state)|Qin]] prefect, arrives at the Qin [[Xianyang|capital city]] to meet the king of Qin, who has survived multiple attempts on his life by the assassins Long Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. As a result, the king has implemented extreme security measures: no visitors are allowed to approach the king within 100 paces. Nameless claims that he has slain the three assassins, and their weapons are displayed before the king, who allows the former to approach within ten paces and tell him his story.\n\nNameless recounts first killing Long Sky at a gaming house, before traveling to meet Flying Snow and Broken Sword, who have taken refuge at a calligraphy school in the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]], which the Qin army besieges. He tells Sword that he is there to commission a calligraphy scroll with the character for \"Sword\" (\u528d), secretly seeking to learn Sword's skill through his calligraphy. Nameless also learns that once-lovers Snow and Sword have grown distant. Once the scroll is complete, Nameless reveals his identity and reveals that Snow and Sky had been together as lovers. Saying that Sky was certain Snow would avenge him, Nameless challenges Snow to a duel the next day. A heartbroken and angry Sword has sex with his pupil Moon. Snow kills Sword in revenge, and later Moon when she attempts to seek vengeance. The next day, Nameless kills an emotionally unstable Snow before the Qin army, and claims her sword.\n\nAs the tale concludes, the king expresses disbelief and accuses Nameless of staging the duels with the assassins; he had, in the previous assassination attempt, perceived Sword as an honourable man who would not betray Snow in that manner. The king then suggests that what really happened was that the assassins volunteered their lives so that Nameless could gain the king's trust, which would allow Nameless to get close enough to the king to kill him.\n\nIn the king's hypothetical version of the story, Nameless seeks out Snow and Sword after staging the battle with Sky, telling them that he has perfected a technique that allows him to kill any target that is within ten paces. Nameless explains that he can use this to kill the king, but to get close enough he must present one of their weapons to the king; he further explains that he only needs to kill one of them in public in order to do this. Snow and Sword argue over who should be the one to die, resulting in a short fight in which Snow injures Sword. She meets Nameless before the Qin army; the recovering Sword watches helplessly as Snow is defeated. Moon later gives Nameless her master's sword, telling him that the swords of Snow and Sword should remain together in death as they had in life.\n\nNameless admits that he does indeed possess the special technique the king alluded to. However, he states that the King has underestimated Sword, and tells the true story. Nameless says that the special technique, while deadly, can also be used to deal a blow that misses all of the victim's vital organs while appearing fatal. He used this technique on Sky, and asks Snow and Sword to cooperate by faking a duel with him as well. Snow agrees to the plan, but Sword refuses. Snow angrily accuses Sword of ruining the opportunity they had three years ago, revealing that Sword had overpowered the king of Qin during their assault on his palace three years prior, but refused to kill him. She then attacks Sword, and manages to wound him with Nameless's help. The next day, Nameless \"kills\" Snow in front of the Qin army. Sword later explains to Nameless that he let the king live because he desired a unified, peaceful China, and that only the king of Qin could achieve that vision. He then sends Nameless off to the Qin capital, writing the words \"[[Tianxia|Our Land]]\" (\u5929\u4e0b) in the sand to persuade Nameless to reconsider the assassination.\n\nThe king, touched by the tale and Sword's understanding of his dream to unify China, ceases to fear Nameless. He tosses his own sword to Nameless and examines the scroll drawn by Sword. The king suddenly realizes it describing that an ideal warrior should, paradoxically, have no desire to kill. Understanding the wisdom of these words, Nameless abandons his mission and spares the king.\n\nWhen Snow learns that Sword convinced Nameless to forgo the assassination, she furiously attacks Sword and unintentionally kills him when he chooses not to defend himself so that she would understand his feelings for her. Overwhelmed with sorrow, Snow commits suicide. At his court's urging, the king reluctantly orders Nameless to be executed for his assassination attempt, understanding that in order to unify the nation, he must enforce the law and use Nameless as an example. Nameless receives a hero's funeral. A closing text identifies the king as [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor of China.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jet Li]] as Nameless ({{zh|t=\u7121\u540d|s=\u65e0\u540d|p=W\u00fam\u00edng}}) <br /> A Qin [[prefect]] of a small province, orphaned at an early age. Forged into a master swordsman over years of training, Nameless possesses the singular technique \"Death at Ten Paces\" (\u5341\u6b65\u4e00\u6bba Sh\u00edb\u00f9 y\u012bsh\u0101) allowing him to strike precisely within that distance. He is the primary conspirator to assassinate the king, but ultimately decides that China's unification and peace are more important than vengeance. ''Hero'' also saw Jet Li's first appearance in a film produced by mainland China, after his debut in ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]''.\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]] as Broken Sword ({{zh|t=\u6b98\u528d|s=\u6b8b\u5251|p=C\u00e1nji\u00e0n}}) <br /> Broken Sword and Flying Snow are the only assassins to ever infiltrate the king's palace, killing hundreds of his personal guard and very nearly the king himself before halting at the last moment. Of all the assassins, Broken Sword is the only one whom Nameless considers his equal in swordsmanship.\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as Flying Snow ({{zh|t=\u98db\u96ea|s=\u98de\u96ea|p=F\u0113ixu\u011b}}) <br /> A skilled assassin, Flying Snow is Broken Sword's lover and his equal as a swordsman. She has vowed revenge upon the King for killing her father in battle. When Broken Sword convinces Nameless to abandon the assassination attempt on the king, Flying Snow kills him and later herself.\n* [[Chen Daoming]] as [[Qin Shihuang|the King of Qin]] ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u738b|p=Q\u00edn W\u00e1ng}}) <br /> An ambitious leader who desires to become the first Emperor of China. Following an assassination attempt, he withdraws into his palace, which he empties of all but his most trusted advisors, and always wears his battle armor.\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as Long Sky ({{zh|t=\u9577\u7a7a|s=\u957f\u7a7a|p=Ch\u00e1ngk\u014dng}}) <br /> An accomplished spearman, Sky is the first to be \"defeated\" by Nameless, who takes Sky's broken spear as proof of his defeat to the king.\n* [[Zhang Ziyi]] as Moon ({{zh|c=\u5982\u6708|p=R\u00fayu\u00e8}}) <br /> Broken Sword's loyal apprentice, skilled in using twin swords.\n\n==Production==\nDirector Zhang Yimou collaborated with Australian cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]] to help realize his plan to divide the film visually into five sections, each dominated by a particular color. Zhang had initially wanted to use different cinematographers and shooting styles, but that proved impractical.<ref name=\"Elley\" />\n\nDoyle compared their story to ''[[Rashomon]]'', as it has an unreliable narrator and stories within stories. The film tells different version of the story of how an anonymous hero in ancient China overcomes three rivals. The stories are dominated by the colors red, blue, and white. Red represents desire, possessiveness and jealousy. Blue represents reason and friendship. White represents the balance of reason and desire, the ultimate truth.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yao |first=Yusheng |date=2002-01-01 |title=The Making of a National Hero: Tao Xingzhi's Legacies in the People s Republic of China |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10714410213690 |journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=251\u2013281 |doi=10.1080/10714410213690 |s2cid=143137062 |issn=1071-4413}}</ref> The overall framing story is darker with shades of black, and flashbacks are shown in vibrant greens.

[[Itzhak Perlman]] performs most of the violin solos, with additional solos by Tan Dun himself.

The guqin music for that scene was performed by Liu Li.\n\n==Release==\n''Hero'' was first released in China on 24 October 2002. [[Miramax]] owned the American-market distribution rights, but delayed the release of the film a total of six times.

For its release in [[Belgium]], two years before the U.S. release, the subtitled translation was \"all under heaven\". The version shown in American cinemas was localized as the two-word phrase \"our land\" instead, which seems to denote just the nation of [[China]] rather than the whole world. Whether Zhang Yimou intended the film to also have meaning with regard to the world and world unity was at that time difficult to say. Zhang Yimou was asked about the change at a screening in [[Massachusetts]] and said it was a problem of translation: \"If you ask me if 'Our land' is a good translation, I can't tell you. All translations are handicapped. Every word has different meanings in different cultures.\"<ref name=\"eye.net\" /> In ''Cause: The Birth of Hero''\u2014a documentary on the making of ''Hero''\u2014Zhang mentions that he hopes the film will have some contemporary relevance, and that, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] the themes of universal brotherhood and \"peace under heaven\" may indeed be interpreted more globally, and taken to refer to peace in \"the world.\"<ref name=\"Cause\" /><ref name=\"Dargis\" /> The phrase was later changed in television-release versions of the film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in China in October 2002.
