A new dam is being built which will flood the valley of Northfork, and the town is in the midst of an evacuation. The narratives focus on several individuals who, for one reason or another, have yet to evacuate. Walter O'Brien ([[James Woods]]) and his son ([[Mark Polish]]) are on the evacuation team, helping to evacuate the last few inhabitants of Northfork. In return, the government will give them acres of lakeside property if they meet their evacuee quota.  Father Harlan ([[Nick Nolte]]) is one such individual, who has stayed behind to care for Irwin (Duel Farnes), a dying orphan too weak to leave town. While the O'Briens and their co-workers encounter an array of unusual characters, Irwin discovers that he is the \"unknown angel\" through a suitcase with his angel wings in it and a Bible with an angel's feather telling his family 'story', and finds himself a family of angels ([[Daryl Hannah]], [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]], [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]], and [[Robin Sachs]]) in his dreams,  who he makes a deal with to take him 'a thousand miles'.\n\n==Cast==\n*Duel Farnes as Irwin\n*[[James Woods]] as Walter O'Brien\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Father Harlan\n*[[Peter Coyote]] as Eddie\n*[[Claire Forlani]] as Mrs. Hadfield\n*[[Clark Gregg]] as Mr. Hadfield (uncredited)\n*[[Mark Polish]] as Willis O'Brien\n*[[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Mr. Hope\n*[[Michele Hicks]] as Mrs. Hope\n*[[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Cod\n*[[Daryl Hannah]] as Flower Hercules\n*[[Robin Sachs]] as Cup of Tea\n*[[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Happy\n*[[Jon Gries]] as Arnold\n*[[Rick Overton]] as Rudolph\n*Douglas Sebern as Mayor\n*Josh Barker as Matt\n\n==Reception==\nNorthfork received mixed to positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 57% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 103 reviews with an average rating of 6 out of 10.
