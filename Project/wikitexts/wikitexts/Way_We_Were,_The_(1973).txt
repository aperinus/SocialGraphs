Their differences are immense; she is a stridently vocal [[Marxism|Marxist]] Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestants]] with no particular political bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not work very hard at it. He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon it, and they lose touch after graduation.\n\nThe two meet again towards the end of World War II while Katie is working at a radio station, and Hubbell, having served as a naval officer in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]], is trying to return to civilian life. They fall in love despite the differences in their backgrounds and temperaments. Soon, however, Katie is incensed by the cynical jokes that Hubbell's friends make at the death of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and is unable to understand his indifference towards their insensitivity and shallow dismissal of political engagement. At the same time, his serenity is disturbed by her lack of social graces and her polarizing postures. Hubbell breaks it off with Katie, but soon agrees to work things out, at least for a time.\n\nWhen Hubbell is offered the opportunity to adapt his novel into a screenplay, Katie believes he is wasting his talent and encourages him to pursue writing as a serious challenge instead. Despite her growing frustration, they move to California where, without much effort, he becomes a successful screenwriter, and the couple enjoy an affluent lifestyle. As the [[Hollywood blacklist]] grows and [[McCarthyism]] begins to encroach on their lives, Katie's political activism resurfaces, jeopardizing Hubbell's position and reputation.\n\nAlienated by Katie's persistent abrasiveness, and although she is pregnant, Hubbell has a liaison with Carol Ann, his college girlfriend and the divorcee of J.J., his best friend. After the birth of their child, however, Katie and Hubbell decide to part, as she finally understands he is not the man she idealized when falling in love with him, and he always will choose the easiest way out, whether it is cheating in his relationship or writing predictable stories for sitcoms. Hubbell, though, is exhausted, unable to live on the pedestal Katie erected for him and face her disappointment in his decision to compromise his potential.\n\nYears later, after their divorce, Katie and Hubbell meet by chance in front of the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City. Hubbell is with a stylishly beautiful woman. He is writing for an unnamed television show. Katie has remarried. Katie invites Hubbell and his lady friend to come for a drink, but he turns down the invitation. Hubbell asks about their daughter Rachel, and whether Katie's new husband is a good father to her. He takes a 'Ban the Bomb' flyer and, saying \"See you, kid.\", walks back to the waiting taxi.\n \nKatie has remained faithful to who she is; flyers in hand, she is agitating now for \"Ban the bomb\", her new political cause.\n\nKatie's and Hubbell's relationship is far behind them, and all the two share now (besides their daughter) is the memory of the way they were.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Katie Morosky\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Hubbell Gardiner\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as J.J.\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Carol Ann\n* [[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]] as George Bissinger\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as Paula Reisner\n* [[Allyn Ann McLerie]] as Rhea Edwards\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Brooks Carpenter\n* [[Herb Edelman]] as Bill Verso\n* [[Diana Ewing]] as Vicki Bissinger\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Pony Dunbar\n* [[George Gaynes]] as El Morocco Captain\n* [[James Woods]] as Frankie McVeigh\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Judianne\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1937, while an undergraduate at Cornell, Arthur Laurents was introduced to political activism by a student who became the model for Katie Morosky, a member of the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] and an outspoken opponent of [[Francisco Franco]] and his effort to take control of Spain via the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The fiery campus radical organized rallies and a peace strike, and the memory of her fervour remained with Laurents long after the two lost touch.\n\nLaurents decided to develop a story with a similar character at its centre, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt he had a good ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His first instinct was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words, but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.<ref>Laurents, Arthur, ''Original Story By''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000. {{ISBN|0-375-40055-9}}, pp. 254-57</ref>\n\nBecause of his own background, Laurents felt it was important for his heroine to be Jewish and share his outrage at injustice. He also thought it was time a mainstream Hollywood film had a Jewish heroine, and because Barbra Streisand was the industry's most notable Jewish star, he wrote the role of Katie Morosky for her. Laurents had known Streisand for some time, having cast her in his 1962 Broadway musical ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]''. Hubbell Gardiner, initially a secondary character, was drawn from several people Laurents knew. The first name was borrowed from urbane television producer Hubbell Robinson, who had hired Laurents to write an episode of ''[[ABC Stage 67]]''. The looks and personality came from two primary sources - writer [[Peter Viertel]] and a man Laurents referred to only as \"Tony Blue Eyes\", an acquaintance who inspired the scene where the creative writing instructor reads Hubbell's short story to his class.<ref>Laurents, pp. 258-63</ref>\n\nLaurents wrote a lengthy treatment for [[Ray Stark]], who read it on a transcontinental flight and called the screenwriter the moment he arrived in Los Angeles to greenlight the project. Laurents had been impressed with ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' and suggested [[Sydney Pollack]] to direct. Streisand was impressed that he had studied with [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in Manhattan and seconded the choice. Stark was less enthusiastic, but agreed because Pollack assured him he could deliver Robert Redford for the role of Hubbell, which Laurents had written with [[Ryan O'Neal]] in mind. O'Neal's affair with Streisand was at its end, and Stark wanted to avoid conflicts between the leads.<ref>Laurents, p. 266</ref>\n\nLaurents ultimately regretted recommending Pollack. The director demanded the role of Hubbell be made equal to that of Katie, and throughout filming, for unexplained reasons, he kept Laurents away from Redford. What was intended to be the final draft of the screenplay was written by Laurents and Pollack at Stark's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho. Laurents, dismayed to discover very little of his work remained when it was completed, left the project. Over time, 11 writers, including [[Dalton Trumbo]], [[Alvin Sargent]], [[Paddy Chayefsky]], and [[Herb Gardner]], contributed to the script. The end result was a garbled story filled with holes that neither Streisand nor Redford liked. Laurents was asked to return and did so only after demanding and receiving an exorbitant amount of money.<ref>Laurents, pp. 267-74</ref>\n\nBecause the film's start date was delayed while it underwent numerous rewrites, Cornell was lost as a shooting location {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} , [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3867/the-way-we-were#articles-reviews?articleId=467350 as was Williams College], where the [[The Graduate (novel)|novel \"The Graduate\"]] had been written 10 years earlier. Union College in Schenectady, New York, was used, instead. Other locations included the village of [[Ballston Spa, New York|Ballston Spa]] in upstate New York; [[Central Park]]; the beach in Malibu, California; and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] in Los Angeles, the latter for a scene Laurents felt was absurd and fought to have deleted, without success.<ref>Laurents, pp. 277-79</ref>\n\nLaurents was horrified when he saw the first rough cut of the film. He thought it had a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall, he thought it was a badly photographed, jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars appeared to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologised for his behaviour. The following day, he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better, but never as good as it could have been.<ref>Laurents, pp. 280-81</ref>\n\nA decade after the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, contacted him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to ''The Way We Were''. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet, but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed they did not want Pollack to be part of the equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script, but aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it, as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he were interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring [[Kathie Lee Gifford]]. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo.<ref>Laurents, pp. 283-85</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{See also|The Way We Were: Original Soundtrack Recording}}\nThe musical score for ''The Way We Were'' was composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]. A soundtrack album was released in January 1974 to much success. At the time of its initial release, the album peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. On October 19, 1993, it was re-released on CD by [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]. It includes Streisand's rendition of \"The Way We Were\", which at the time of the film's release was a commercial success and her first number-one single in the United States. It entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in November 1973 and charted for 23 weeks, eventually selling over a million copies and remaining number one for three non-consecutive weeks in February 1974. On the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart, it was Streisand's second top hit, following \"[[People (1964 song)|People]]\" a decade earlier. It was the title track of a [[The Way We Were (Barbra Streisand album)|Streisand album]] that reached number one.\n\n==Reception==\nIn North America, the film was a massive commercial success, grossing  $49,919,870.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Way-We-Were-The#tab=box-office|publisher=The Numbers|title=The Way We Were (1973)|access-date=May 26, 2014|archive-date=April 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406063957/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Way-We-Were-The#tab=box-office|url-status=live}}</ref> It ranked fifth among high-grossing films of the year, earning an estimated $10 million in North American rentals in 1973,<ref>\"Big Rental Films of 1973\", ''Variety'', 9 January 1974 p 19</ref> and a total of $22,457,000 in its theatrical run.\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Way We Were'' was featured on the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|Top Ten Films of 1973]] by the [[National Board of Review]]. Roger Ebert of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave the film three stars out of four and called it \"essentially just a love story, and not sturdy enough to carry the burden of both radical politics and a bittersweet ending.\" He added \"It's easy to forgive the movie a lot because of Streisand. She's fantastic. She's the brightest, quickest female in movies today, inhabiting her characters with a fierce energy and yet able to be touchingly vulnerable...The Redford character perhaps in reaction to the inevitable Streisand performance, is passive and without edges. The primary purpose of the character is to provide someone into whose life Streisand can enter and then leave. That's sort of thankless, but Redford handles it well.\" Ebert further added \"Instead, inexplicably, the movie suddenly and implausibly has them fall out of love--and they split up without resolving anything, particularly the plot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19731017/REVIEWS/301010336/1023|title=The Way We Were|author=Roger Ebert|date=17 October 1973|access-date=3 May 2018|archive-date=14 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614031636/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19731017%2FREVIEWS%2F301010336%2F1023|url-status=live}}</ref> Gene Siskel of the ''Chicago Tribune'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \"with Streisand as the film's intellectual mouthpiece\u2014and listen, as a singer, God bless her\u2014there is no way that the film's ideas are going to come off as anything but patronizing and tinged with comedy.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (October 31, 1973). \"The Way We Were\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 9.</ref>\n \nIn her review, [[Pauline Kael]] noted, \"the decisive change in the characters' lives which the story hinges on takes place suddenly and hardly makes sense.\" She was not the only critic to question the gap in the plot. Of the scene in the hospital shortly after Katie gives birth and they part indefinitely, [[Molly Haskell]] wrote, \"She seems to know all about it, but it came as a complete shock to me.\"<ref>Laurents, pp. 281-82</ref> The sloppy editing was exposed in other ways, as well. In his review, critic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] wrote: \"Some things, I suppose, never change, like the necktie Redford wears in two scenes that take place many years apart.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n''Variety'' called it \"a distended, talky, redundant, and moody melodrama\" and adds, \"but Robert Redford has too little to work with in the script,\" and \"The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just another one of those Streisand vehicles where no other elements ever get a chance.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1972/film/reviews/the-way-we-were-2-1200422897/|title=The Way We Were|author=Variety Staff|work=Variety|date=31 December 1972|access-date=29 April 2018|archive-date=7 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107005303/https://variety.com/1972/film/reviews/the-way-we-were-2-1200422897/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Time Out London'' observed \"[W]ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade.

Loopner says of the film \"It's about a Jewish woman with a big nose and her blond boyfriend who move to Hollywood, and it's during the blacklist and it puts a strain on their relationship.\"\n\n''[[The Simpsons]]'' had three episodes, one called \"[[The Way We Was]]\" (first aired in 1991), \"[[The Way We Weren't]]\" (first aired in 2004), and \"The Wayz We Were\" (first aired in 2021), although their plots are unrelated to the film.\n\nIn season one of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', Lorelei attempts to guess Dean's darkest secret is that he secretly wanted Robert Redford to dump his wife and children for Barbra Streisand. Dean admits that he has not seen \"The Way We Were\". In another episode of ''Gilmore Girls'', Lorelei tells Sookie that she is reminded of ''The Way We Were'' because she hid from Luke the fact that she had lunch with Christopher. In season five of ''Gilmore Girls'', Lorelei calls Luke after they have broken up and tells him that she was thinking about ''The Way We Were'' and reminded him of how Katie called Hubbell after they had broken up and asked him to come sit with her because he was her best friend and she needed her best friend.\n\nOn the show ''[[Friends]]'', Rachel Green lists ''The Way We Were'' as the most romantic movie of all time.\n\nIn ''[[That '70s Show]]'', Kitty Forman says that ''The Way We Were'' was a nice film after Eric explains a scene in ''[[Star Wars]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Sex and the City]]'', Carrie uses ''The Way We Were'' as an analogy for her relationship with Big. The girls proceed to sing the film's theme song, and later, when Carrie bumps into Big outside his engagement party, she quotes a line from the film.\n\nIn the movie ''[[The Jerk]]'', Marie (Bernadette Peters) is sobbing over the demise of her relationship while a drunk Navin Johnson (Steve Martin) is writing checks for $1.09. He is badgering her and asks why she is crying and why she is wearing an old dress from one of their very first meetings. She responds \"Because I just heard a song on the radio that reminded me of the way we were.\" \"What was it?\" he asks. She sobs in reply, \"''The Way We Were.''\"\n\nIn a season one episode of the sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]'', [[Doug Heffernan|Doug]] and Richie contemplate watching ''The Way We Were'' on the \"Romance Channel,\" because there was nothing else on during daytime TV.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1973]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0070903}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|way_we_were}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|3867}}\n* {{AllMovie title|53615}}\n* {{AFI film|54392}}\n* [http://www.jacknilan.com/senatorjoe/waywewere.html McCarthyism and the Movies The Way We Were (1973)]\n* [https://www.barbra-archives.info/way_we_were_streisand Barbra Archives: ''The Way We Were'' cut scenes and song demos]\n\n{{Sydney Pollack}}\n{{Arthur Laurents}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Way We Were, The}}\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1973 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Marvin Hamlisch]]\n[[Category:Films about the Hollywood blacklist]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sydney Pollack]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:American interfaith romance films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Arthur Laurents]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
