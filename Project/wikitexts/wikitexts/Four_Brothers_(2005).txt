The incident brings her four adoptive sons back home to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] to find out what happened. The oldest is a lifelong criminal, hot-tempered Bobby; the second oldest is family man and Union construction worker Jeremiah; the third oldest is an ex-hustler and former US Marine, Angel; and the youngest is aspiring rock musician Jack.\n\nOriginally under the impression the crime was a simple robbery gone wrong, the brothers chase down and interrogate a false witness to the police, after which the brothers discover that the robbery was a cover for a [[contract killing|hit]] put out on Evelyn. The brothers track down the pair of [[hitman|hired guns]] who shot and killed Evelyn, and after refusing to give up any information, the two hitmen are executed by the enraged Bobby and Angel. The next day, [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit Police]] Lieutenant Green and Detective Fowler confront the brothers about the murders. While the brothers deny involvement, Lieutenant Green warns them that their interference with Evelyn's case is ill-advised and that it will put them in over their heads.\n\nAfter confronting Jeremiah about the revelation of his failing business and benefiting from Evelyn's life insurance, Jeremiah informs his brothers that his construction company was failing precisely because he was not getting involved with gang lord Victor Sweet and that for a project to succeed he had to pay off the right people, which he initially failed to do. In his effort to restore his business and relieve pressure on himself, he tried to pay off Sweet's henchmen. As for the life insurance, Jeremiah explains that the money went directly to him for his daughters, because he paid all of Evelyn's bills while the other brothers were not around. Sweet's men attack the brothers; Jack is shot during the attack and subsequent gunfight, and dies shortly after. Bobby and Angel manage to fend off and kill the gunmen. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them, confirming it was Sweet.\n\nLieutenant Green arrives and informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed that report on to Sweet. Green warns them to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler, and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar, Green asks Fowler about Fowler seeing Evelyn a week before she was killed and asks him, \"Why didn't you tell me that? Don't you think that that's relevant to a murder investigation?\" Fowler simply responds, \"I didn't tell you because it wasn't relevant at all\". Fowler then lies and says the police report that Evelyn filed was given to another department to handle, though Green already knows that Fowler gave the report to Sweet. Realizing that Fowler is a crooked cop, Green attacks Fowler with a pool stick and orders Fowler to hand in his badge. After they walk out of the bar, Fowler shoots and kills Green and calls into dispatch claiming two Black assailants had fired upon Green.\n\nThe remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. Arriving at Fowler's, Angel subdues him. Jeremiah goes to meet Sweet while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells them that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler believes they are coming for Angel, until Angel opens his jacket revealing a [[covert listening device|wire]]. Angel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, at which point Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel. With his gun pointed at Angel's head, Fowler tells the officers outside to back off, and despite telling him they are there to rescue him, Fowler opens fire on the officers, who kill him.\n\nMeanwhile, at frozen-over [[Lake St. Clair]], Jeremiah meets with Sweet, who reveals that he intends to kill him. Then Jeremiah reveals that the $400,000 is to pay off Sweet's henchmen, who are already embittered towards him because of his blatant mistreatment of them, in exchange for killing Sweet. Sweet angrily demands to know who will be the one to kill him, just as Bobby shows up. Bobby and Sweet [[hand-to-hand combat|brawl]], during which Bobby uses his hockey playing skills to get the upper hand, knocking Sweet unconscious. His former henchmen seal his fate, dropping him into a hole carved in the ice.\n\nThe three brothers, taken into police custody, are beaten in an attempt to make them [[confession (legal)|confess]] to the murder of Sweet but give up nothing. Back home, they set about repairing their mother's house and continuing their lives together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Bobby Mercer, the oldest of the Mercers. \n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Angel Mercer, Bobby's younger adoptive brother, ex-Marine and hustler.\n* [[Andr\u00e9 3000|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]] as Jeremiah Mercer, Bobby's younger adoptive brother, family man and construction worker \n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Jack Mercer, Bobby's youngest biological brother, youngest of the Mercers, and aspiring rock musician \n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Lieutenant Green\n* [[Josh Charles]] as Detective Fowler\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Sofi, Angel's girlfriend\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Victor Sweet\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Evelyn Mercer, the adoptive mother of Bobby, Jeremiah, Angel & Jack\n* [[Taraji P.
