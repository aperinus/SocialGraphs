On her first day, she and her parents Walter ([[Lane Smith]]) and Connie ([[Cindy Pickett]]) meet Crawl ([[Pauly Shore]]) [[resident advisor]] of Becca's [[coed]] [[dormitory]]. After they leave, the clash of cultures causes Becca to consider returning home, but Crawl convinces her to give the college a chance. She soon begins to acclimate, cutting and dyeing her hair, dressing in a Californian style, and even getting a [[tattoo]] of a butterfly on her ankle. Becca invites Crawl to spend the [[Thanksgiving]] break with her family back home.\n\nWhen Becca and Crawl arrive in South Dakota, the Warners and Becca's boyfriend Travis ([[Dan Gauthier]]) are shocked by the changes in Becca. At dinner, Becca realizes that Travis wants to [[marriage|propose marriage]] to her and she urges Crawl to speak. Unable to come up with anything off the cuff, Crawl tells them that he has already proposed and she had accepted. This upsets Becca's family, who begin to disdain Crawl, and Travis, punches Crawl in the face.\n\nNow acting as a future son-in-law, Crawl expresses an interest in farming but bumbles his way through daily chores, to the amusement of Walter and his [[Farmworker|farmhand]] Theo ([[Dennis Burkley]]). However, Crawl begins to prove himself as an avid farmer, quickly learning how to perform each task he's given. He also begins to endear himself to the rest of the family. He impresses Becca's little brother Zack ([[Patrick Renna]]) with his computer skills, and Zack begins to see him as a big brother. He compliments Connie's appearance and helps to bring her out of her shell for Walter. When Walter's father has a heart attack, Crawl performs [[CPR]] and earns Walter's trust for aiding his father.\n\nWhile shopping for clothes, Crawl meets Becca's friend Tracy ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]). Travis apologizes to Crawl for hitting him and invites him to a [[bachelor party]], where Tracy dances for Crawl.\n\nThe next morning, Becca finds Crawl and Tracy waking up in the barn and furiously calls off the wedding, but Crawl and Tracy cannot remember what happened. Crawl leaves to head back to L.A. while Travis, who had been seeing Tracy on the side, berates her for behavior the previous night. Tracy finds her car seat suspiciously left all the way back and discovers a bottle of pills underneath it.\n\nAfter picking up Crawl, who was attempting to [[hitchhike]], Tracy visits the Warner house to confront Travis and Theo while the Warners are sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner. Theo confesses that they drugged them and that he set them up in the barn. Walter immediately fires Theo despite his honesty. Becca stands up to Travis and Crawl knocks him down, revealing that he had majored in [[karate]] for two semesters.\n\nAfter Travis and Theo leave, Tracy is invited to sit with the Warners while Walter asks his son-in-law to cut the turkey. Becca tries to speak the truth about Crawl's proposal, but he stops her, saying that they have not yet decided on a wedding date and need wait a while before making the decision, hinting that he intends to legitimately propose to Rebecca and have a proper relationship that the Warners will respect.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Fred/\"Crawl\"\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Warner\n* [[Lane Smith]] as Walter Warner\n* [[Cindy Pickett]] as Connie Warner\n* [[Mason Adams]] as Walter Warner, Sr.\n* [[Patrick Renna]] as Zack Warner\n* [[Dennis Burkley]] as Theo\n* [[Dan Gauthier]] as Travis\n* [[Tiffani Thiessen|Tiffani-Amber Thiessen]] as Tracy\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Indian\n* [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] as tattoo artist\n\n[[Brendan Fraser]] reprises his role of Linkovich \"Link\" Chomovsky from ''[[Encino Man]]'' in a cameo appearance.\n\n==Production==\nAfter ''[[Encino Man]]'', Shore was considering a project with [[New Line Cinema]], but was heavily pressured by Disney chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to stay with Disney and make ''Son in Law''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-20/entertainment/ca-1690_1_hollywood-pictures | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jeffrey | last=Wells | title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies: TOTALLY TINSELTOWN: The War Over Pauly Shore's Next Movie or Why Hollywood Is Sooooo Much Fun | date=20 September 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Promotions==\nThe [[Film poster|promotional poster]] for the film is a [[parody]] of the painting ''[[American Gothic]]''.
