When Rob is killed by [[thief-taker|Thief Taker General]] Chance ([[Ken Stott]]) after a botched heist outside [[debtor's prison]], Plunkett must find a way to retrieve a large [[ruby]] that his partner had swallowed. What he doesn't know is that the incident was witnessed by James Macleane ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), a socialite from the upper echelons of society, who had found himself in [[debtor's prison]]. Macleane sees the same ruby as his ticket out of debtors' prison and decides to steal it.\n\nPlunkett ambushes Macleane and forces him to give up the ruby, but when they are discovered by Chance's men, Plunkett swallows it. While in [[Newgate Prison]], the two form a partnership that utilizes Plunkett's criminal know-how and Macleane's social status to bribe their way out of prison. This tentative partnership leads to an unlikely alliance, deemed \"The Gentlemen Highwaymen\", where they gladly relieve the gentry of their possessions.\n\nWhen Macleane falls for the beautiful Lady Rebecca ([[Liv Tyler]]), the niece of the powerful Lord Gibson ([[Michael Gambon]]), their plans to escape to America go awry. The pair part ways after a disastrous attempt to rescue Lady Rebecca from forced exodus, which leads to the death of Lord Gibson, and the discovery that Macleane has gambled away all of their funds.\n\nMacleane is eventually captured and tried for Lord Gibson's murder, earning him a date with the [[gallows]]. Plunkett orchestrates a daring escape, aided by Lady Rebecca and the flamboyant Lord Rochester ([[Alan Cumming]]). After a tense chase through the city sewers that sees Plunkett exact revenge upon Chance, the three escape to freedom.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Captain James Macleane\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Will Plunkett\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Lady Rebecca Gibson\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Thief Taker General Chance\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Lord Rochester\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Lord Gibson\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Eddie\n* [[David Walliams]] as Viscount Bilston\n* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] as Sir Oswald\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Dixon\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Dennis\n* [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]] as Winterburn\n* [[Noel Fielding]] as Brothel Gent\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as M.P.'s Secretary\n* [[Iain Robertson]] as Rob\n* [[Claire Rushbrook]] as Lady Estelle\n* [[Tom Ward]] as a member of parliament\n}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Plunkett & Macleane'' underperformed at the US box office.<ref name=\":1\" /> The film opened on 1 October 1999 in 475 U.S. theaters, taking in $244,765 during its first three days; total US earnings stand at $474,900.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=plunkettandmacleane.htm|title=Box office information for ''Plunkett & Macleane''|access-date=29 June 2011|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film received mainly negative reviews; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists a 24% critic rating from 29 critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/plunkett_and_macleane/|title=Reviews for ''Plunkett & Macleane''|access-date=29 June 2011|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]}}</ref> while [[Metacritic]]'s Metascore is 44 from 27 reviews (indicating \"mixed or average reviews\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/plunkett-macleane|title=Reviews for ''Plunkett & Macleane''|access-date=29 June 2011|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>\n\nDerek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"[T]he script and dialogue are nowhere near well-tooled enough, and the film's generally dark, cold look and baroque design play against the lighter touch required.
