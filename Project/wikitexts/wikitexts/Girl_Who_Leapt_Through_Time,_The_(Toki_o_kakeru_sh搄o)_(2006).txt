Released by [[Kadokawa Pictures|Kadokawa Herald Pictures]], the film is a loose sequel to the 1967 [[The Girl Who Leapt Through Time|novel of the same name]] by [[Yasutaka Tsutsui]] and shares the basic premise of a young girl who gains the power of [[time travel]] and repeatedly relives the same day in a [[time loop]], but with a different story and characters than the novel. [[Riisa Naka]] voices teenager Makoto Konno, who learns from Kazuko Yoshiyama, Makoto's aunt and the protagonist to the original story, that Makoto has the power to [[time travel|travel through time]]. Makoto begins using the time-leaps frivolously to fix problems.\n\n''The Girl Who Leapt Through Time'' was released on July 15, 2006, and received positive reviews. The film won numerous awards, including the [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]]. The English version was licensed and produced by [[Kadokawa Pictures USA|Kadokawa Pictures U.S.]], with dubbing supplied by [[Ocean Productions]], and released by [[Bandai Entertainment]] in 2008 and re-released by [[Funimation]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-02-18/funimation-licenses-the-girl-who-leapt-through-time-anime-film/.98810|title=Funimation Licenses The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Anime Film|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 18, 2016|access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Kuranose High School in Tokyo, Japan, 17-year-old Makoto Konno discovers a message written on a [[blackboard]] and ends up inadvertently falling onto a walnut-shaped object. On her way to the [[Tokyo National Museum]] to meet with her aunt, Kazuko Yoshiyama, she is ejected into a [[railroad crossing]] when the brakes on her bicycle fail and hit by an oncoming train, but finds herself transported back in time when she was riding her bicycle right before the accident. After telling Kazuko what happened, she helps Makoto realize she now has the power to \"time-leap\", the ability to literally travel through time. At first, Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late, get perfect grades, avoid mishaps and even relive a single [[karaoke]] session for several hours, but soon discovers her actions can adversely affect others.\n\nConsequently, Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously to prevent undesirable situations from happening, including an awkward love confession from her best friend, Chiaki Mamiya. Makoto realizes she has a numbered tattoo on her arm indicating the limited number of times she can time leap. Using her remaining time leaps, Makoto attempts to make things right for everyone. When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask if she has been time-leaping, she uses her final time-leap to prevent Chiaki's call. In the meantime, Makoto's friend K\u014dsuke Tsuda and his new girlfriend, Kaho Fujitani, borrow her faulty bike. Makoto attempts to stop them, but as she had just used her final leap, she is unable to rescue them from being hit by the train.\n\nA moment later, Chiaki freezes time. Telling Makoto he is from the future, he explains the walnut-shaped object is his time-traveling device, and used it to time-leap hoping to see a painting that Kazuko is restoring, as it has been destroyed in the future. While walking with Makoto in the frozen city, Chiaki explains why he stayed longer in her time than he originally planned. Consequently, he has used his final leap to prevent K\u014dsuke and Kaho from the train accident and he has stopped time only to explain to Makoto he is unable to return to his own time period, and having revealed his origins and the nature of the item that allowed Makoto to leap through time, Chiaki must leave. Then Makoto realizes she is in love with him.\n\nTrue to his words, Chiaki disappears once time resumes. Initially distraught by Chiaki's disappearance, Makoto discovers Chiaki's time-leap inadvertently restored her final time-leap: Chiaki leaped back to the time before Makoto used it. Makoto uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she originally gained her powers; Chiaki would still have his one remaining time-leap. Recovering the used up time-travel device, she explains her knowledge of everything as she shows it to Chiaki. Makoto vows to ensure the painting's existence so Chiaki can see it in his era. Before Chiaki departs, he tells Makoto he will be waiting for her in the future. When K\u014dsuke asks her where Chiaki went, she tells him Chiaki went to study abroad. She has made a decision about her own future.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Makoto Konno}}|\u7d3a\u91ce \u771f\u7434|Konno Makoto}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Riisa Naka]]|[[Emily Hirst]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Chiaki Mamiya}}|\u9593\u5bae \u5343\u662d|Mamiya Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takuya Ishida]]|[[Andrew Francis]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kosuke Tsuda}}|\u6d25\u7530 \u529f\u4ecb|Tsuda Kousuke}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsutaka Itakura]]|[[Alex Zahara]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Yuri Hayakawa}}|\u65e9\u5ddd \u53cb\u68a8|Hayakawa Yuri}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Ayami Kakiuchi]]|[[Kristie Marsden]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kaho Fujitani}}|\u85e4\u8c37 \u679c\u7a42|Fujitani Kaho}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mitsuki Tanimura]]|[[Natalie Walters]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kazuko Yoshiyama}}|\u82b3\u5c71 \u548c\u5b50|Yoshiyama Kazuko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sachie Hara]]|[[Saffron Henderson]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Miyuki Konno}}|\u7d3a\u91ce \u7f8e\u96ea|Konno Miyuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuki Sekido]]|[[Shannon Chan-Kent]]}}\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Sojiro Takase}}|\u9ad8\u702c \u5b8b\u6b21\u90ce|Takase Sojiro}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoji Matsuda]]|[[David Hurwitz (actor)|David Hurwitz]]}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Release ===\n''The Girl Who Leapt Through Time'' was released to a small number of theaters in [[Japan]], taking in approximately {{JPY|300&nbsp;million|link=yes}} ({{US$|3 million|long=no|link=yes}}).<ref name=\"JapanBO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-02-20/tokikake-wins-animation-of-the-year-at-japanese-academy-awards-follow-up|title=Tokikake Wins \"Animation of the Year\" at Japanese Academy Awards: Follow Up|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 20, 2007|access-date=May 5, 2007}}</ref> The film received limited advertising as opposed to other animation features, but word of mouth and positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-07-26/gedo-senki-panned-by-online-critics|title=Gedo Senki Panned by Online Critics|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 26, 2006|access-date=May 5, 2007}}</ref> generated interest.
