The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]]. Semple and Rayfiel received an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Motion Picture Screenplay.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\nJoe Turner is a bookish [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst, code named \"Condor\". He works at the American Literary Historical Society in New York City, which is actually a clandestine CIA office. The seven staff members examine books, newspapers, and magazines from around the world and compare them to actual operations or to find ideas. Turner files a report to [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] on a thriller novel with strange plot elements; despite poor sales it has been translated into many languages.\n\nTurner leaves through a back door to get staff lunches. Armed men enter the office and murder the other six staffers. Turner returns to find his coworkers dead; frightened, he grabs a gun and exits the building.\n\nHe contacts the CIA's New York headquarters in the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] from a phone booth and is given instructions to meet Wicks, his head of department, who will bring him to safety. Turner insists that Wicks bring somebody familiar, since \"Condor\" has never met his departmental head. Wicks brings Sam Barber, a college friend of Turner who is also a non-field CIA employee. The rendezvous is a trap and Wicks attempts to kill Turner, who wounds his superior before escaping. Wicks kills Barber to eliminate a witness and, taken into hospital, blames Turner for both shootings. Later, an intruder eliminates Wicks by turning off his life support system.\n\nTurner encounters a woman, Kathy Hale, and forces her to take him to her apartment. He holds Hale hostage while he attempts to figure out what is happening. Hale slowly comes to trust Turner, and they become lovers.\n\nHowever, Joubert, a European who led the massacre of Turner's co-workers, discovers Turner's hiding place. He visits Sam Barber's building and spends some tense moments in the elevator with Turner once the other passengers have left. After Turner leaves the building Joubert tries to shoot him but Turner manages to blend into a small crowd. The next morning a hitman disguised as a mailman arrives at Hale's apartment, but Turner manages to kill him.\n\nNo longer trusting anyone within \"the Company\", Turner plays a cat-and-mouse game with Higgins, the deputy director of the CIA's New York division. With Hale's help, Turner abducts Higgins, who identifies Joubert as a freelance assassin who has undertaken assignments for the CIA. Back at his office, Higgins discovers that the \"mailman\" who attacked Turner worked with Joubert on a previous operation. Their CIA case officer was Wicks.\n\nMeanwhile, Turner discovers Joubert's location by utilizing his [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] training to trace a phone call. Turner also learns the name and address of Leonard Atwood, CIA [[Deputy Director of Operations]] for the Middle East. Turner confronts Atwood at the latter's Washington D.C.-area mansion, interrogates him at gunpoint, and learns that Turner's original report filed to CIA headquarters had provided links to a rogue operation to seize Middle Eastern oil fields. Fearful of its disclosure, Atwood privately ordered Turner's section be eliminated.\n\nAs Atwood confirms this, Joubert enters and unexpectedly kills the CIA deputy director. Atwood's superiors had hired Joubert to stage the suicide of someone who was about to become an embarrassment, overriding Atwood's original contract for Joubert to kill Turner. Joubert suggests that the resourceful Turner leave the country and even become an assassin himself. Turner rejects the suggestion but heeds Joubert's warning that the CIA will try to eliminate him as another embarrassment, possibly entrapping him through a trusted acquaintance.\n\nBack in New York, Turner has a rendezvous with Higgins near [[Times Square]]. Higgins describes the oilfield plan as a [[contingency plan|contingency \"game\"]] that was planned within the CIA without approval from above. He defends the project, suggesting that when oil shortages cause a major economic crisis, Americans will demand that their comfortable lives be restored by any means necessary. Turner points to ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[229 West 43rd Street|building]] and says he has \"told them a story.\" Higgins is dismayed, asking Turner, \"What have you done?\" He then tells Turner that he is about to become a very lonely man, and he questions whether Turner's [[whistleblowing]] will really be published. \"They'll print it,\" Turner defiantly replies. However, as \"Condor\" turns away, Higgins calls out \"How do you know?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Turner (Condor)\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Kathy Hale\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as Higgins\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Joubert\n* [[John Houseman]] as Wabash\n* [[Addison Powell]] as Leonard Atwood\n* [[Walter McGinn]] as Sam Barber\n* [[Tina Chen]] as Janice Chong\n* Michael Kane as S.W.

However, in an interview with ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'', Pollack explained that the film was written solely to be a spy thriller and that production on the film was nearly over by the time the Family Jewels revelations were made, so even if they had wanted to take advantage of them, it was far too late in the filmmaking process to do so. He said that despite both Pollack and Redford being well-known political [[liberalism in the United States|liberals]], they were only interested in making the film because an espionage thriller was a genre neither of them had previously explored.<ref name=\"jumpcut\">{{cite journal | title=Hollywood uncovers the CIA | first=Patrick | last=McGilligan | journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] | url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC10-11folder/PollackMcGilligan.html | year=1976 | issue=10\u201311 | access-date=December 24, 2013 | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119062758/http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC10-11folder/PollackMcGilligan.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I didn't want this picture to be judged; it\u2019s a movie.
