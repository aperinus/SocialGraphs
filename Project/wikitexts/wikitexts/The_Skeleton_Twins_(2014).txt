September 9, 2014.] by Richard Corliss at Time Magazine. Retrieved December 31, 2014</ref> The film received positive reviews; critics praised Johnson's direction and the performances of Hader and Wiig.\n\n==Plot==\nMaggie is in her bathroom preparing to swallow a handful of pills, but she is interrupted by a phone call from a hospital, informing her that her twin brother Milo\u2014whom she hasn't seen in 10 years\u2014has attempted suicide. Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in [[Los Angeles]] and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of [[Nyack, New York]]. He agrees, and meets Maggie's husband Lance.\n\nMilo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her.\n\nMilo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, whose teaching career had ended when Maggie exposed their relationship.\n\nMilo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy whom their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to.\n\nLance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives.\n\nMaggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no \"marriage\" and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her.\n\nThe film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Milo Dean, Maggie's brother\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Maggie Dean, Milo's sister\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Lance, Maggie's husband\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Rich Levitt, Milo's former teacher whom he'd had an affair with in high school\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Billy, Maggie's scuba instructor\n* [[Joanna Gleason]] as Judy Dean, Maggie and Milo's mother\n* [[Adriane Lenox]] as Dr. Linda Essex\n* [[Kathleen Rose Perkins]] as Carlie\n* Paul Castro Jr as Eric\n\n==Production==\nThe script went through several iterations, including one in which Milo is a drag queen and the film more closely resembles a road trip movie,<ref name=Huffington>{{cite web|last1=Hasan|first1=Zaki|title=Interview: Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, and Craig Johnson on The Skeleton Twins|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zaki-hasan/interview-kristen-wiig-bi_b_5808802.html|website=Huffington Post|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> but eventually Johnson and his writing partner settled on a more low-key approach inspired by the work of [[Hal Ashby]] and [[Alexander Payne]].<ref name=Huffington/> Writing the film, Johnson wanted to avoid writing along genre lines, as he believes that comedy and drama are both present in everyday life.<ref name=Salon>{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Prachi|title=\"The Skeleton Twins\" director Craig Johnson on comedy, tragedy and Bill Hader|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/the_skeleton_twins_director_craig_johnson_on_comedy_tragedy_and_bill_hader/|website=Salon.com|date=21 January 2014|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> He has described the theme of the movie as \"dealing with dark shit with a sense of humor.\"<ref name=Salon/>\n\nOne notable scene features the two main characters lip syncing to \"[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]\" by [[Starship (band)|Starship]].<ref name=\"EWlips\">{{cite magazine|last1=Bahr|first1=Lindsey|title=Behind Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader's epic lip sync in 'Skeleton Twins'|url=https://ew.com/article/2014/07/15/skeleton-twins-bill-hader-kristen-wiig/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=9 March 2017}}</ref> Initially, the song the writers planned to use was \"[[Hold On (Wilson Phillips song)|Hold On]]\" by [[Wilson Phillips]], but as the song had already played a focal point in [[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]], it was decided to choose another song.<ref name=\"EWlips\"/> Accordingly, Johnson  \"spent 24 hours listening to every cheesy mid-\u201980s ballad you can think of and looking in the mirror and lip syncing it myself.\"<ref name=\"EWlips\"/> The fact that \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" is a [[duet]] opened up new possibilities: Johnson said, \"the scene became a little more epic because it became about Bill\u2019s character getting Maggie (Wiig) to sing Grace Slick\u2019s part\".<ref name=\"EWlips\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography, which began on November 2012 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]],<ref name=\"olv-announce\">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/11/27/kristen-wiig-and-bill-hader-begin-filming-the-skeleton-twins-in-nyc/ |title=Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader begin filming 'The Skeleton Twins' in NYC |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref>  took place over 22 days.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patches|first=Matt|title=Sundance Preview: 'Skeleton Twins' Reunites Former 'SNL' Co-stars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-preview-skeleton-twins-reunites-671708|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=January 18, 2014|date=January 16, 2014}}</ref> Although a full script was written, Johnson encouraged improvisation on the set.<ref name=Salon/> Johnson has stated that an entirely improvised conversation between Wiig and Wilson involving [[Vibram]] shoes was his single favorite scene in the entire film.<ref name=Salon/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Skeleton Twins'' opened in a [[limited release]] in the United States in 15 theaters and grossed $380,691; the  average take per theater was $25,379, and it ranked #25 at the box office.
