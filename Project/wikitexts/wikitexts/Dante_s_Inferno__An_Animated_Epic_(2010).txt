The film was released on February 9, 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\nReturning from the [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u20131192), Dante arrives home to find his servants slain, his father dead and his beloved fiancee [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] dying of a stab wound to the stomach. As she dies, [[Satan|Lucifer]] plucks Beatrice into the gates of [[Hell]] and Dante gives chase. [[Virgil]] appears and offers to guide him through Hell. They board [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], a demonic, living ferry that takes [[soul]]s to the First Circle of Hell. Charon commands [[demon]]s to attack Dante, as no living being is allowed to enter. Dante fights them off, kills Charon, and steers him into the first circle, [[Limbo]].\n\nIn Limbo, Dante learns Beatrice was pregnant with his child while he was away, but miscarried. Attacked by demonic children, he and Virgil escape into a large building; they enter a hall of great rulers, philosophers, and thinkers. Moving on, they battle King [[Minos]], whose task is to send [[Damnation|condemned]] souls to their sin's corresponding circle of Hell.\n\nIn the second circle, [[Lust]], Dante is reminded that he was once unfaithful to Beatrice. Upon hearing this, Beatrice begins to lose faith.\n\nThe pair come to a [[grotto]] where men and women who had lived their lives in [[gluttony]] are devoured by [[Cerberus]], the great hound of Hell. Virgil tells Dante that the only way to the next circle is from within the beast, so Dante allows himself to be eaten. He encounters Ciacco, a man from his village, who confesses to gluttony; Dante tells him to be free and blesses him with his cross. Dante attacks and destroys the hound's [[heart]] to escape.\n\nIn the fourth circle, [[Greed]], Dante confronts his [[Alighiero di Bellincione|father]]. The pair trade barbs with each other and Dante kicks his father into a vat of boiling gold.\n\nIn the fifth circle, [[Wrath]], Dante recognizes [[Filippo Argenti]] who taunts him, only to be brought down by other wrathful spirits. Dante sees Lucifer in the city of Dis; he announces to the city's damned souls his intent to marry Beatrice.\n\nIn the sixth circle, [[Heresy|heretics]] do [[Christian views on hell#Eternal torment view|forever burn in fire]] and are tortured. Dante meets and kills his rival [[Farinata degli Uberti|Farinata]]. Entering the Forest of [[Suicide]]s, Dante hears a familiar cry and finds his mother growing from the sapling of a tree. Believing that she had died of a fever, Dante is overwhelmed with sorrow; he uses his [[cross]] to [[Redemption (theology)|free her soul]].\n\nIn the realm of [[Fraud]], Virgil parts ways with Dante and Dante begins to reflect upon his own [[sins]]. Beatrice weds Lucifer and becomes a demon. Beatrice attacks Dante, forcing him to look into the ninth circle of [[Betrayal|Treachery]], where he sees his greatest sin: allowing her brother to take the blame for his slaughter of the heretic prisoners. Overwhelmed with grief, he gives Beatrice her cross and pleads with her to accept the [[love of God]]. She [[Forgiveness|forgives]] him and promises that they will be together soon, but in order to escape Hell, he will need to face Lucifer alone.\n\nDante realizes that he cannot stop Lucifer on his own; he [[Supplication|begs]] for [[Divinity|divine]] forgiveness. An explosive beam of light emanates from Dante, and Lucifer is frozen solid.\n\nDante dives into the [[Chasm (disambiguation)|chasm]] that leads through the earth to Purgatory to be with Beatrice, now \"neither completely living, nor completely dead\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Graham McTavish]] - [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]\n* [[Vanessa Branch]] - [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]\n* [[Steve Blum]] - [[Lucifer]]\n* [[Peter Jessop]] - [[Virgil]]\n* [[Mark Hamill]] - [[Alighiero di Bellincione|Alighiero]], Dante's father\n* [[Victoria Tennant]] - Bella\n* Bart McCarthy - [[Filippo Argenti]]\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] - [[King Minos]], [[Phlegyas]]\n* [[JP Karliak|John Paul Karliak]] - Avenger\n* Tom Tate - Francesco\n* J.
