The screenplay by [[Ronald Harwood]] adapts [[Charles Dickens]]'s [[Oliver Twist|1838 novel of the same name]]. It is an [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] of the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, France and Italy.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 11 September 2005 before going into [[limited release]] in the United States on 23 September. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, but was a [[box office bomb|commercial failure]].\n\n==Plot==\nNine-year-old orphaned [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]] is taken to the workhouse by the [[beadle]] [[Mr. Bumble]]. After daring to ask for more food, Oliver is sold as an apprentice to [[Mr Sowerberry|Mr. Sowerberry]], a local [[Funeral director|undertaker]], but runs away following harsh treatment.\n\nOliver travels a seven-day journey to London where he befriends a young boy named [[Artful Dodger|Jack Dawkins]], better known as the Artful Dodger, who takes him to join a gang of pickpockets led by the villainous [[Fagin]]. He also becomes acquainted with [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]], a former pupil of Fagin's who is in love with Fagin's associate, [[Bill Sikes]]. Dodger and his friend [[Charley Bates]] take Oliver out to teach him to pick pockets - it ends in disaster when Oliver is falsely arrested for stealing from [[Mr Brownlow|Mr. Brownlow]]. However, Mr. Brownlow decides to take Oliver in and care for him when he learns of the boy's innocence.\n\nFagin and Sikes become worried that Oliver will bring down the authorities onto them, so force Nancy to help bring Oliver back. Sikes forces Oliver to help him rob Mr. Brownlow's house at gunpoint - Oliver is wounded in a shootout between Sikes and Mr. Brownlow. Sikes and Fagin later decided that Oliver knows too much and will likely 'peach' on them. Sikes suggests that they kill the boy, to which Fagin agrees, despite caring for the boy. Nancy overhears this and manages to inform Mr. Brownlow of Fagin's plan, managing to keep Sikes out of it. However, unbeknownst to her, Dodger has been sent by Fagin to spy on her and tells Fagin and Sikes, the latter of whom murders her.\n\nNancy's murder becomes public and the police across the city intend to arrest both Sikes and Fagin, for murder and abduction, respectively. Sikes' dog, Bullseye, leads the authorities to the gang's hideout. Sikes uses Oliver as a hostage whilst attempting to escape, but accidentally hangs himself. Oliver is brought back to live with Mr. Brownlow and goes to visit Fagin in jail. He is sad to see Fagin, who was kind to him, hallucinating and even more devastated to hear that Fagin will be executed for his crimes. The film ends with Oliver and Mr. Brownlow returning home to continue their lives, whilst a crowd gather to witness Fagin's hanging.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Fagin]]\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as [[Bill Sikes|William \"Bill\" Sikes]]\n* [[Barney Clark (actor)|Barney Clark]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver Twist]]\n* [[Leanne Rowe]] as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as [[Mr. Brownlow]]\n* [[Harry Eden]] as [[The Artful Dodger]] (Jack Dawkins)\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Toby Crackit\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Mrs. Bedwin\n* Lewis Chase as [[Charley Bates]]\n* Michael Heath as Mr. Sowerberry\n* [[Gillian Hanna]] as Mrs. Sowerberry\n* [[Chris Overton]] as Noah Claypole\n* [[Jeremy Swift]] as [[Bumble (Oliver Twist)|Mr. Bumble]]\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Mr. Grimwig\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Mr. Limbkins\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Magistrate Fang\n* [[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]] as Old Woman\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as Bookseller\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nIn ''Twist by Polanski'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Roman Polanski discusses his decision to make yet another screen adaptation of the Dickens novel. He realized nearly forty years had passed since ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' had been adapted for a feature film, and felt it was time for a new version. Screenwriter [[Ronald Harwood]], with whom he had collaborated on ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', welcomed the opportunity to work on the first Dickens project in his career.\n\nFor authenticity, all scenes featuring pickpocket skills were choreographed by stage pickpocket [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]] and magician Martyn Rowland.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Prague]], [[Beroun]], and [[\u017datec]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\n==Differences from the Novel==\nDue to the complex plot, several characters and events were omitted or changed.\n\nThe film does not explain where Oliver was raised prior to arriving at the workhouse. Mr. Bumble's role is reduced - there is no mention of him losing his job at the workhouse. Additionally, the characters of Monks (Oliver's half brother) and the Widow Corney are absent, therefore omitting any plot to destroy the locket proving Oliver's identity as well as Fagin and Monks' plan to prevent Oliver from inheriting his father's fortune by having him commit a crime. To make up for the absence of Monks, there is a plot in which Fagin and Sikes conspire to murder Oliver - an event which does not occur in the novel.\n\nIn the novel, it is left ambiguous as to how Oliver and Mr. Brownlow are related. As in many versions (such as the [[Oliver Twist (1997 film)|1997 Disney version]] and the [[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|1948 adaptation]] by [[David Lean]]), Brownlow is made Oliver's grandfather, however, unlike in previous versions, this relationship is more implied than explicitly stated.\n\nDue to the absence of the Maylie family, Oliver is not left by Sikes to die during the burglary, rather he is taken back to Fagin's. The Artful Dodger is not deported to Australia and, therefore, plays a larger role in some of the later events in the story. Firstly, he is sent by Fagin (instead of Noah Claypole who appears only in the earlier scenes) to spy on Nancy, indirectly causing her death by informing Fagin and Sikes that she has informed on them. Secondly, it is Dodger (instead of Charley Bates, whose role is also smaller in the film than the novel) who turns against Fagin and attempts to give up Sikes to the police for murdering Nancy. However, his ultimate fate is left unknown after Sikes' death.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 61% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 143 reviews, averaging 6.3/10. The consensus reads, \"Polanski's version of Dickens' classic won't have audiences asking for more because while polished and directed with skill, the movie's a very impersonal experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Oliver Twist (1999)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10005499-oliver_twist/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|access-date=18 August 2012|author=Rotten Tomatoes|year=2012}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned a score of 65, indicating 'generally favorable reviews.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oliver-twist|title=Oliver Twist|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=16 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"bracingly old-fashioned\" film that \"does not embalm its source with fussy reverence\" but \"rediscovers its true and enduring vitality.\" He added, \"the look of the movie... is consistent with its interpretation of Dickens's worldview, which could be plenty grim but which never succumbed to despair. There is just enough light, enough grace, enough beauty, to penetrate the gloom and suggest the possibility of redemption. The script... is at once efficient and ornate, capturing Dickens's narrative dexterity and his ear for the idioms of English speech.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=A.O.
