Also appearing are cinematographer [[Ernest Dickerson]] as a [[Queens, New York]], resident and, in an early appearance, [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] as a doctor. The plot concerns a young woman (Johns) who is seeing three men, and the feelings this arrangement provokes.\n\nIn 2017, Lee adapted the film [[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|into a Netflix series]].\n\nIn 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nNola Darling is a young, attractive graphic artist living in [[Brooklyn]] who juggles three suitors: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet; the self-obsessed [[Model (person)|model]] Greer Childs; and the immature, motor-mouthed bicycle messenger Mars Blackmon. Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, while each man wants her for himself.\n\nHer carefree, sexually liberated lifestyle ultimately comes to an end when her three male suitors meet and compare notes on Nola. While Greer justifies Nola's callous behavior by claiming that she sees the three not as individuals but as a collective, Jamie and Mars become bitter over how little Nola cares for all three men. Opal, a lesbian friend of Nola's who believes every person is capable of sexual fluidity, expresses attraction to her and when Nola asks how having sex with a woman is, offers her an opportunity to find out. However, Nola declines.\n\nRealizing that Greer and Mars are too scared of losing Nola to force her to choose one of them, Jamie tells her that she must choose a single lover. Nola scoffs at this, and persuades him to come to her apartment several days later for casual sex. Jamie rapes her and mockingly asks her if he's as good sexually as Greer or Mars. Nola has an epiphany: realizing that her choices have turned Jamie against her, she decides to call his bluff. Nola dumps Greer and Mars and tells Jamie that she is ready for a monogamous relationship. Believing that her sexual activity has prevented her from committing to a single guy, Nola tells Jamie their relationship has to be celibate for the time being. After at first rejecting Nola's \"no sex\" decree, Jamie agrees to it.\n\nNola and Jamie's reunion, however, is followed by a coda which dismantles the \"happy ending\" of the couple coming together. In a monologue delivered to the camera, Nola reveals that her vow of celibacy and her decision to be with Jamie exclusively was \"a moment of weakness\". She says that she soon began to cheat on Jamie and their relationship collapsed. Nola proudly proclaims that monogamy is a form of slavery and that her lifestyle is freedom in its purest form. The film closes with a view of Nola going to bed alone.\n\n==Themes==\nNola idealizes the freedom to have multiple sexual partners that men have typically enjoyed. \"A woman (or, at least Nola) can be a sexual being, doesn\u2019t have to belong to a man, and perhaps shouldn't even wish for such a thing.\"<ref name =\"henderson2008\">{{cite web | title = She's Gotta Have It | url = https://www.popmatters.com/review/shes-gotta-have-it/ |website = PopMatters | last = Henderson | first = Stuart | date = 13 January 2008 | url-status=live | access-date = 29 October 2022}}</ref> The narrative provided by Nola's narration has been described as the most revolutionary element in the film, a representation of the struggle African American women faced in society at the time.<ref name=\"diawara\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tracy Camilla Johns]] as Nola Darling\n* Tommy Redmond Hicks as Jamie Overstreet\n* John Canada Terrell as Greer Childs\n* [[Spike Lee]] as [[Mars Blackmon]]\n* Raye Dowell as Opal Gilstrap\n* [[Joie Lee]] as Clorinda Bradford\n* Dennis Karika as The Trainer\n* [[S.

It was also a groundbreaking film for African-American filmmakers and a welcome change in the representation of blacks in American cinema, depicting men and women of color not as pimps and whores, but as intelligent, upscale urbanites.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/44229/She-s-Gotta-Have-It/overview | first=A.

The 12-shooting-days production began with $18,000 from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], a $10,000 grant from the [[Jerome Hill|Jerome Foundation]], $500 from the Brooklyn Arts and Cultural Association, assists from Lee's family (a score from dad Bill, still photos from brother David, an acting turn from sister Joie, brothers Chad and Cinque acting as production assistants), and a cast working for deferred payments.<ref name=\"mtv.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2770944/spike-lee-film-funding/|title=Joint Financing: Spike Lee Has Never Had an Easy Time Funding His Films|first=Vadim|last=Rizov|website=MTV News}}</ref>\n\nThat wasn't enough to get the movie through post-production, so a rough cut screening happened at [[NYU]]. \"I'm Spike Lee and I hope that you liked the film,\" Lee said afterwards. \"I'll be calling you soon about becoming financially involved in helping us complete it.\" The final budget was $175,000, and the resulting release was profitable ($7.1 million domestically).<ref name=\"mtv.com\"/>\n\n==Impact==\nThe film catalyzed the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]] neighborhood where it was shot. Lee portrayed the neighborhood as a vibrant cosmopolitan community where successful African Americans thrived, focusing not only on Nola and her struggles, but also on local children, residents, and graffiti. [[Fort Greene Park]] is the setting of much of the movie, and is portrayed as a comfortable place for the characters. People were encouraged to investigate the area's public spaces and viewers in other places investigated similar thriving public spaces of community importance.<ref name=\"diawara\">Diawara, Manthia: \"Homeboy Cosmopolitan\", in ''Search of Africa''.
