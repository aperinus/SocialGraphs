[[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] and the robots [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]], along with [[Gypsy (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Gypsy]], are aboard the [[Satellite of Love (Mystery Science Theater 3000)|Satellite of Love]] high in Earth's orbit, when Forrester forces them to watch the film ''This Island Earth'' to break their wills; as in the television series, Mike, Crow and Tom riff the film as it plays.\n\nThe film-riffing scenes are book-ended and interspersed with short, unrelated sketches:\n* In the introduction, Crow attempts to dig through the ship's hull to return to Earth. \n* Crow and Tom dare Mike to drive the Satellite himself, but he ends up crashing into the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].\n* Tom reveals that he has an \"interocitor\" like that used in ''This Island Earth''. The gang tries to use Tom's device to return to Earth, but they instead contact a Metalunan (the alien race from the film) who is unable to help them to figure out how to use it correctly but does accidentally repeatedly zap Tom's head with a laser beam.\n* After ''This Island Earth'' finishes, Mike, Crow, and Tom are nowhere near broken and are having a party on the satellite. Furious at his failure, Forrester attempts to use his own interocitor to harm them, but only succeeds in transporting himself into the shower of the Metalunan previously seen.\n* During the credits, the film [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] as the crew returns to the theater and riffs on ''MST3k: The Movie''<nowiki/>'s ending credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

Universal studio executives attended the series' \"ConventioCon ExpoFest-O-Rama\" in 1994, where the cast performed a live riff on ''This Island Earth'', a Universal production. [[Universal Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film through [[Gramercy Pictures]]. The film was shot away from the [[Best Brains]] corporate headquarters and studio in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]], at Energy Park Studios in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie'' (1996) \u2013 Filming locations|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117128/locations|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=2012-01-16}}</ref>\n\n;Deleted scenes\n* At the beginning of the film, it was originally planned <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZqEqmJAO_8 Love Theme From Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie on YouTube]</ref> to have a new version of the \"MST3K Love Theme\" by [[Dave Alvin]], but the song was reduced to an instrumental version over the end credits.\n* To trim the film's duration, Gramercy ordered one of the host segments to be cut.
