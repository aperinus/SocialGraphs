Hathaway received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nKym Buchman is released from [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] for a few days to attend her older sister Rachel's wedding at their childhood home. While friends and family prepare for the festivities, Kym struggles to reintegrate with them, as her history of substance abuse has made her the [[black sheep]] of the family.\n\nDespite Kym's nine months of sobriety, her father Paul is uncomfortable with her driving, leading her to bike to a mandated drug test and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting. She returns home and is introduced to Rachel's fianc\u00e9 Sidney and his best man Kieran. Recognizing each other from the meeting, Kym and Kieran have sex, and he reveals that Rachel's best friend Emma will be her [[maid of honor]]. Kym confronts her sister, and it becomes clear that Kym's self-destructive behavior has caused a deep rift between them.\n\nRachel resents the attention her sister is drawing away from the wedding, exacerbated by Kym's behavior at the [[rehearsal dinner]]: amid [[toast (honor)|toasts]] from friends and family, Kym awkwardly jokes about her addiction and \"makes amends\" with Rachel and others in the gathering for her past actions, as part of her [[twelve-step program]]. Later Rachel, angry at what she thinks is Kym's insincere and inappropriate \"amends,\" erupts at Kym and the two engage in an intense argument, which Rachel ends by announcing she is pregnant, to the delight of everyone but Kym.\n\nA disagreement between Sidney and Paul about loading the dishwasher turns into a friendly competition, which is cut short when Paul finds a plate that belonged to his late son Ethan, Rachel and Kym's younger brother. At another NA meeting, Kym reveals that she was responsible for Ethan's death: as a teen, an intoxicated Kym was driving Ethan home, but lost control of the car and drove into a lake, where he drowned.\n\nThe day before the wedding, the bridal party visits a salon, where Kym is approached by a man she met at rehab years ago. He thanks her for having inspired him with her stories of overcoming trauma; overhearing this and realizing these stories were lies, Rachel storms out, angry that Kym would lie about having been [[child molestation|molested]] by an uncle or tending to an [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]] sister.\n\nTensions flare between the sisters when Rachel tells the family that Kym was untruthful during her treatment, and that she has never forgiven Kym for their brother's death. Kym acknowledges that any amount of progress she makes may never make her worthy of forgiveness, and drives off in her father's car. She goes to Abby, her and Rachel's mother, but her attempt to find closure backfires; Abby refuses to take responsibility for leaving Kym with Ethan when she knew her daughter was an addict, culminating in a physical altercation.\n\nDistraught, Kym crashes the car in what may have been an attempted suicide, but survives. The morning of the wedding, she is woken in the car by police and passes a field sobriety test, then is driven home and makes her way to Rachel's room. Seeing Kym's bruised face, Rachel tenderly bathes and dresses her sister, discovering Kym's tattoo of a rose with \"Ethan\" tattooed beneath it.\n\nAmid a festive [[Culture of India|Indian]] theme, Rachel and Sidney are wed. Kym is the maid of honor, and is overcome with emotion as the couple exchange their vows. She tries to enjoy herself throughout the reception, but continues to feel alienated, and plagued by her dispute with Abby, who leaves early despite Rachel's effort to bring them together. The next morning, as Kym returns to rehab, Rachel runs out of the house to hug her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Kym Buchman\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Rachel Buchman\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Paul Buchman\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Abby Buchman\n* [[Tunde Adebimpe]] as Sidney Williams\n* [[Mather Zickel]] as Kieran\n* [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as Carol\n* Anisa George as Emma\n* [[Beau Sia]] as wedding Czar\n* [[Tamyra Gray]] as singing friend\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Walter\n* [[Annaleigh Ashford]] as grocery clerk\n* [[Roger Corman]] as wedding guest\n* [[Dorian Missick]] as rehearsal dinner guest}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[screenplay]] was written by [[Jenny Lumet]], the daughter of director [[Sidney Lumet]] and granddaughter of [[Lena Horne]]. Lumet, a junior high school drama teacher, had written four earlier screenplays, but this was the first to be produced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The film was directed by [[Jonathan Demme]], and was shot in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] in a [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] style. The working title for the film was originally ''Dancing with Shiva''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nSidney Lumet himself approached Demme about his daughter Jenny's script. Demme has commented that he loved Jenny's flagrant disregard for the rules of formula, her lack of concern for making her characters likable in the conventional sense, and for what he considered to be her bold approach to truth, pain, and humor.<ref name=\"sonyclassics1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyclassics.com/rachelgettingmarried/main.html |title=Rachel Getting Married |publisher=Sonyclassics.com |access-date=2011-02-13}}</ref>\n\nFilming took 33 days and occurred in late 2007.<ref name=Hathaway/>\n\n===Casting===\nDemme had wanted to work with [[Anne Hathaway]] ever since he spotted her in a crowd at a screening five years earlier. He immediately took her in consideration for the lead role.<ref name=\"sonyclassics1\"/> Hathaway later said of her first reading Lumet's script: \"I was in my old apartment in the [[West Village]] [[Manhattan]], just pacing back and forth between the kitchen table and the couch.

Demme and the rest of the crew were impressed and immediately wanted her to play Rachel. [[Bill Irwin]] is a personal friend of Demme's.\n\n[[Tunde Adebimpe]]'s role, Sidney, was originally offered to American film director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] while he was working on the post-production of the movie ''[[There Will Be Blood]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.spout.com/2008/09/17/jonathan-demme-interview-rachel-getting-married-toronto-2008/ |title=Jonathan Demme Interview, Rachel Getting Married, Toronto 2008 |first=Kevin |last=Kelly|publisher=SpoutBlog |access-date=2011-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920020614/http://blog.spout.com/2008/09/17/jonathan-demme-interview-rachel-getting-married-toronto-2008/ |archive-date=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDemme was concerned about [[Debra Winger]]'s interest in doing the film, but he pumped up his courage to ask her because they had met several times before at the Jacob Burns Center, a film center close to their homes. Winger later accepted the role of Abby.<ref name=\"sonyclassics1\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe music-loving director Demme invited musicians to compose the score live on set, to support the film's storyline.<ref name =independent>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rachel-getting-married--lights-camera-music-1380275.html| title = Rachel Getting Married - Lights, camera, music ...| first = Elisa | last = Bray | date = January 16, 2009| access-date = March 2, 2015| work = [[The Independent]]\n}}</ref>\n\n\"For the longest time,\" Demme has said, \"I've had this desire to provide the musical dimension of a movie without traditionally scored music. I thought: wait a minute; in the script, Paul [father of the bride] is a music-industry bigwig, Sidney's a record producer, many of his friends will be gifted musicians, so of course there would be non-stop music at this gathering. We have music playing live throughout the weekend, but always in the next room, out on the porch or in the garden.\"<ref name =independent/>\n\nThroughout the unconventional filming and loosely staged scenes, a New York\u2013based [[Middle East]]ern ensemble, including [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] musician [[Zafer Tawil]], and [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] [[Amir ElSaffar]], who played the score of Demme's documentary ''[[Man from Plains]]'', compose the score on set. Always present at the filming, the musicians had the freedom\u2014and were encouraged\u2014to play whenever they were inspired to, and to ignore the camera.\n\nAccording to Demme on the DVD, during filming of a dramatic scene, Hathaway complained about the music interfering with the mood, to which Demme responded, \"Tell her to do something about it!\" Hathaway, in that scene, responded by improvising the line, \"Can you tell them to knock it off?!\" to which another actor not heavily involved in the scene went off-screen and told the band to stop.<ref>Jonathan Demme commentary, ''Rachel Getting Married'' DVD</ref>\n\nWell-known actors mingle anonymously on-screen with musicians, artists, and dancers. Among them are the [[New Orleans|New Orleanian]] saxophonist [[Donald Harrison Jr.]], and the [[Brooklyn]]-based [[TV on the Radio]]'s lead singer [[Tunde Adebimpe]].\n\nSinger-songwriter [[Robyn Hitchcock]] plays a wedding guest. At the ceremony Hitchcock, at the request of his old friend Demme, performs the song \"America\" from his 1982 album ''[[Groovy Decay]]''. He also plays \"Up To Our Nex.\" written for the movie. \"It's my micro-encapsulation of the movie. The song is trying to be a voice in Kym's head.\"<ref name =independent/> Filmed in one take at the wedding party, he is spontaneously joined by the [[hip-hop]] star [[Fab 5 Freddy]], and the [[dancehall reggae|dancehall]] singers [[Sister Carol]], ElSaffar and Tawil.\n\nHitchcock recalled,\n\n{{cquote|My memory of the whole thing is of being at a real wedding, although without the alcohol. A lot was shot in real time and the end result was the whole thing seemed as if it really had happened. It's as real as it gets. By the time I did 'Up To Our Nex' in the tent I had 15 people. Amir did a horn arrangement and Demme's son [[Brooklyn Demme]] was on electric guitar. We hadn't all played together before. The line between reality and fiction \u2013 it was a door you could walk in and out of as much as you liked. The idea that they are just playing live, that's the beauty of it. The thing I really liked about the music in the movie is that it all happens in real time. The moments of real tension in the film are not signposted by the score. It's not telling you how you're going to react when the music comes. The music is very organic, not manipulative.<ref name =independent/>}}\n\nFor Demme, it was about creating evocative music in the moment.<ref name =independent/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received critical acclaim and appeared on many \"Best Film of 2008\" lists.

I do wish that Demme hadn't let the wedding music, by Robyn Hitchcock, Sister Carol East, and a few others, take over the last act. This much healing-by-'80s-hipster-taste is too much.
