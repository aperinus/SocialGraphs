The Blarg need this new world as their home, Quartu, has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution. The destruction attracts the attention of the peacekeeping Galactic Rangers. At a factory that produces Drek's warbots on Quartu, a defective robot is produced due to a black-out, and flies to Kerwan to inform the Rangers of Drek's plan. After getting shot down, he encounters a young lombax spaceship mechanic named Ratchet on the planet Veldin. Ratchet names him Clank, and the two fly to Kerwan, where they save the Rangers from Drek's army of warbots. Their actions gain both Ratchet and Clank immense popularity, which pressures the commander of the Rangers, Captain Qwark, to name them honorary Rangers.\n\nQwark, jealous of Ratchet and Clank's acclaim, is approached by Drek to help him, an offer he accepts so long as Drek never harms the other Rangers. Drek has him disable the Rangers' weapons during an assault on his planet-destroying [[superweapon]], the Deplanetizer. Drek's lieutenant, Victor Von Ion, boards the Rangers' flagship and attacks Clank, who manages to reduce him to a rusty wreck using a rainstorm-producing weapon. After Drek breaks apart the planet Novalis, his chief scientist, Doctor Nefarious (who orchestrated Qwark's betrayal), suddenly fires a sheep transforming gun at Drek, stuffs him in an escape pod and ejects him to New Quartu. He takes control of the Deplanetizer, intending to destroy the entire Solana Galaxy in revenge for Qwark's mistreatment of him when he was a Ranger. His plan is to destroy the planet Umbris, which has a highly unstable core that would annihilate all other planets in its vicinity.\n\nThe Rangers attack the Deplanetizer again, but Qwark intercepts and battles Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet pleads with Qwark to stop, causing Qwark to realize he has been used, and the three confront Nefarious. Nefarious fires the laser, but the Rangers move it off target from Umbris and towards New Quartu, killing Drek who has just crash-landed. Nefarious tries to disintegrate Qwark with his personal weapon, the RYNO (stands for \"Rip You a New One\"), but is stopped short by Ratchet, causing Nefarious himself to be seemingly disintegrated as he falls into the Deplanetizer's laser chamber. Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark manage to escape through a teleporter as the Deplanetizer falls towards Umbris, where it vaporizes in the atmosphere. With Nefarious thwarted, the Rangers return to Kerwan and Qwark is demoted to Private and ordered to apologize to the whole galaxy. Ratchet and Clank reunite on Veldin, with Ratchet promising to rejoin the Rangers if he is needed.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Nefarious is shown to be still be alive on Umbris, having his body forcibly converted into a robotic form to survive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[James Arnold Taylor]] as [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]], a young mechanic who dreams of being a Galactic Ranger.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/> He was previously voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]] in the original video game version.\n* [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]] as [[Clank (Ratchet & Clank)|Clank]], an intelligent warbot defect who escapes and befriends Ratchet.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/>\n* [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] as [[Captain Qwark|Captain Copernicus Qwark]], the egocentric leader of the Galactic Rangers and a galaxy-wide celebrity.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/>\n* [[Armin Shimerman]] as [[Doctor Nefarious]], Drek's evil chief scientist who has a vendetta against Captain Qwark.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/><ref>{{cite tweet|user=RatchetMovie|author=Ratchet and Clank|number=380052267006582785|title=We are excited that @ShimermanArmin has joined the cast for #ratchetandclankmovie! @insomniacgames @Blockade @RainmakerEnt @PlayStation|date=September 17, 2013|access-date=May 13, 2015 }} <br />{{cite tweet|author=Paul Robinson|user=Topottsel|date = September 17, 2013|number=380060203196383232|title=@RatchetMovie I assume this means Dr Nefarious is making an appearance?|access-date=May 13, 2015}} <br />{{cite tweet|user=RatchetMovie|author=Ratchet and Clank|number=380067831049494531|title=@Topottsel Yep!|date = September 17, 2013|access-date=May 13, 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Chairman Drek|Chairman Alonzo Drek]], the ruthless, eccentric and charismatic leader of the Blarg.<ref name=\"Cast Update\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/13/ratchet-clank-animated-movie-lines-up-star-studded-voice-cast|title=Ratchet & Clank Animated Movie Lines Up Star-Studded Voice Cast|work=IGN|date=May 13, 2015|access-date=13 May 2015|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim}}</ref> He was previously voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the original game.\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[Ratchet & Clank#Grimroth Razz|Grimroth \"Grim\" Razz]], a garage owner on Veldin who is Ratchet's adoptive father and mentor.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/>\n* [[Bella Thorne]] as [[Ratchet & Clank#Talwyn Apogee|Cora Veralux]], a rigid Galactic Ranger.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/>\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Elaris, the Rangers' technical support officer.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/>\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as  Lieutenant Victor Von Ion: Drek's robotic lieutenant.<ref name=\"Cast Update\"/> He is an original character created for the film.\n* [[Vincent Tong (actor)|Vincent Tong]] as Brax Lectrus: a large, reptilian Galactic Ranger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/08/sneak-peek-ratchet-and-clank-animated-movie/79965840/|title=Sneak peek: 'Ratchet & Clank' takes buddy comedy to space|publisher=Usatoday.com|date=2016-02-09|access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref>\n** Vincent Tong also portrays a Solana Trooper\n* Andrew Cownden as [[Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault|Zed]], Drek's bumbling assistant whom the Rangers often interrogate.\n** Andrew Cownden also voices a Blarg.\n* Don Briggs as the Starship Commander\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] as Blarg\n* [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]] as Dallas Wannamaker, Announcer, Drek Computer\n* [[Brian Drummond]] as Mr. Zurkon, Inspectobot, Warbot, The Plumber\n* [[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]] as Stanley: a Blarg troop that Drek and Victor Von Ion bust for texting.\n* [[Alessandro Juliani]] as Solana Trooper\n* [[Rebecca Shoichet]] as Stanley's Mom, Ship Computer\n* [[Tabitha St. Germain]] as Juanita Alvaro\n* [[Brad Swaile]] as Ollie, Superfan\n* [[Lee Tockar]] as Mr. Micron, a Tharpod citizen of Veldin.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was produced at [[Rainmaker Entertainment]]'s [[Vancouver, Canada]] studio and executive produced by president Michael Hefferon.
