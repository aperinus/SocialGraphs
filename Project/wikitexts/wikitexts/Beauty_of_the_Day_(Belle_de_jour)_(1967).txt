Based on the 1928 novel ''[[Belle de jour (novel)|Belle de jour]]'' by [[Joseph Kessel]], the film is about a young woman who spends her midweek afternoons as a high-class prostitute, while her husband is at work.<ref name=imdb>{{cite web|title=Belle de Jour|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061395/|accessdate=12 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the film is a play on words on the French term ''belle de nuit'' (\"beauty of the night\", i.e., a prostitute), as S\u00e9verine works during the day under the pseudonym \"Belle de Jour\". Her nickname can also be interpreted as a reference to the French name of the [[morning glory]] (''Convolvulaceae''), meaning \"beauty of [the] day\", a flower that blooms only during the day.\n\n''Belle de Jour'' is one of Bu\u00f1uel's most successful and famous films with many film historians calling Deneuve's performance her finest.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}} It won the [[Golden Lion]] and the Pasinetti Award for Best Film at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1967.<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for Belle de Jour |publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061395/awards |access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nS\u00e9verine Serizy ([[Catherine Deneuve]]), a young and beautiful housewife, is unable to share physical intimacy with her husband, Dr. Pierre Serizy ([[Jean Sorel]]), despite their love for each other. Her sexual life is restricted to elaborate fantasies involving [[Dominance and submission|domination]], [[sadomasochism]], and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]]. Although frustrated by his wife's frigidity toward him, he respects her wishes.\n\nWhile visiting a ski resort, they meet two friends, Henri Husson ([[Michel Piccoli]]) and Ren\u00e9e ([[Macha M\u00e9ril]]). S\u00e9verine does not like Husson's manner and the way he looks at her. Back in Paris, S\u00e9verine meets up with Ren\u00e9e and learns that a common friend, Henriette, now works at a brothel. At her home, S\u00e9verine receives roses from Husson and is unsettled by the gesture. At the tennis courts, she meets Husson and they discuss Henriette and houses of pleasure. Husson mentions a high-class [[brothel]] to S\u00e9verine at 11 Cit\u00e9 Jean de Saumur. He also confesses his desire for her, but S\u00e9verine rejects his advances.\n\nHaunted by childhood memories, including one involving a man who appears to touch her inappropriately, S\u00e9verine goes to the high-class brothel, which is run by Madame Ana\u00efs ([[Genevi\u00e8ve Page]]), who names her \"Belle de Jour.\" That afternoon S\u00e9verine services her first client. Reluctant at first, she responds to the \"firm hand\" of Madame Ana\u00efs and has sex with the stranger. After staying away for a week, S\u00e9verine returns to the brothel and begins working from two to five o'clock each day, returning to her unsuspecting husband in the evenings. One day, Husson comes to visit her at home, but S\u00e9verine refuses to see him. Still, she fantasizes about having sex with him in her husband's presence. At the same time, S\u00e9verine's physical relationship with her husband is improving and she begins having sex with him.\n\nS\u00e9verine becomes involved with a young criminal, Marcel ([[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]]), who offers her the kind of thrills and excitement of her fantasies. When Marcel becomes increasingly jealous and demanding, S\u00e9verine decides to leave the brothel, with Madame Ana\u00efs's agreement. S\u00e9verine is also concerned about Husson, who has discovered her secret life at the brothel. After one of Marcel's associates follows S\u00e9verine to her home, Marcel visits her and threatens to reveal her secret to her husband. S\u00e9verine pleads with him to leave, which he does, referring to her husband as \"the obstacle\".\n\nMarcel waits downstairs for Pierre to return home and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees but is shot dead by police. S\u00e9verine's husband survives but is left in a coma. The police are unable to find a motive for the attempted murder. Sometime later S\u00e9verine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now paralysed, blind and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. After Husson leaves, S\u00e9verine returns to see Pierre crying. In an ambiguous ending which is hinted to be another of her fantasies, Pierre then gets out of the wheelchair, pours himself a drink and discusses holiday plans with S\u00e9verine.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Catherine Deneuve]] as S\u00e9verine Serizy, alias Belle de Jour\n*[[Jean Sorel]] as Pierre Serizy\n*[[Michel Piccoli]] as Henri Husson\n*[[Genevi\u00e8ve Page]] as Madame Ana\u00efs\n*[[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]] as Marcel\n*[[Fran\u00e7oise Fabian]] as Charlotte\n*[[Macha M\u00e9ril]] as Ren\u00e9e\n*[[Maria Latour]] as Mathilde\n*[[Marguerite Muni]] as Pallas\n*[[Francis Blanche]] as Monsieur Adolphe\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Maistre]] as The professor\n*[[Georges Marchal]] as Duke\n*[[Francisco Rabal]] as Hyppolite\n\n==Production==\n;Costume design\nMuch of Deneuve's wardrobe was designed by [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves St. Laurent]].\n\n;Filming locations\n*1 Square Albin-Cachot, Paris 13, Paris, France\n*79 [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], Paris 8, Paris, France\n*Chalet de la Grande Cascade, [[Bois de Boulogne]], Paris 16, Paris, France\n*Champs Elys\u00e9es, Paris 8, Paris, France\n*Rue de Messine, Paris 8, Paris, France (Serizy's home)<ref>{{cite web|title=Locations for Belle de Jour|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061395/locations|accessdate=12 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Belle de Jour'' holds an approval rating of 95%, based on 58 reviews, and an average rating of 8.6/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belle du Jour|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/belle_de_jour|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=Fandango Media|accessdate=30 October 2022}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' gave the film 4 stars out of 4 and included it into his Great Movies list.<ref>{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-belle-de-jour-1967|title=Belle de Jour|date=25 July 1999|accessdate=12 March 2021|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n!width=\"5%\"|Year\n!width=\"50%\"|Award\n!width=\"20%\"|Recipient\n!width=\"5%\"|Result\n|-\n|1967\n|[[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]] Award\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1967\n|Venice Film Festival Pasinetti Award for Best Film\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1968\n|[[Bodil Award]] for Best European Film\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1968\n|[[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]] Award for Best Film\n|Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|1969\n|[[BAFTA Award]] Nomination for Best Actress\n|Catherine Deneuve\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n===Home media===\nAmerican director [[Martin Scorsese]] promoted a 1995 limited re-release in America<ref>per DVD extras trailer</ref> and a 2002 release on DVD.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2006, the Portuguese director [[Manoel de Oliveira]] released ''[[Belle Toujours]]'', imagining a future encounter between the characters of S\u00e9verine and Henri Husson from the original film.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2010, ''Belle de Jour'' was ranked No. 56 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's list, The 100 Best Films of World Cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Films of World Cinema|publisher=Empire|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/100-greatest-world-cinema-films/default.asp?film=56|accessdate=12 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sadism and masochism in fiction]]\n*[[Surrealism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0061395}}\n* {{AllMovie title|84748}}\n* [http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2121-belle-de-jour-tough-love ''Belle de jour: Tough Love''] \u2013 an essay by Melissa Anderson at [[The Criterion Collection]]\n{{Luis Bu\u00f1uel}}\n{{The Golden Lion 1949\u20131969}}\n\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1960s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:BDSM in films]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films about sexual repression]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert and Raymond Hakim]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]]\n[[Category:French erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:French psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Golden Lion winners]]\n[[Category:Italian erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Italian psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]\n[[Category:French-language Italian films]]"}]}}}}
