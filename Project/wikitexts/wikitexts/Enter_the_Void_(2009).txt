It is a [[psychological drama]] [[fantasy film]] set in the neon-lit nightclub environments of [[Tokyo]]. The story follows Oscar, a young American [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]] who gets fatally shot by the police, but continues to watch subsequent events during an [[out-of-body experience]]. The film is shot from a [[First-person narrative|first-person viewpoint]], which often floats above the city streets, and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past. No\u00e9 labels the film a \"psychedelic melodrama\".<ref name=\"presskit interview\" />\n\nNo\u00e9's dream project for many years, the production was made possible after the commercial success of his earlier feature film ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]]'' (2002). ''Enter the Void'' was primarily financed by [[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]], while Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and [[psychedelic drug]] experiences. Principal photography took place on location in Tokyo, and involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio [[BUF Compagnie]], which also provided the [[computer-generated imagery]]. The film's soundtrack is a collage of [[electronic pop]] and [[experimental music]].\n\nA rough cut premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], but post-production work continued, and the film was not released in France until almost a year later. A cut-down version was released in the United States and United Kingdom in September 2010. The critical response was sharply divided: positive reviews described the film as captivating and innovative, while negative reviews called it tedious and puerile. The film performed [[box office bomb|poorly at the box office]].\n\n==Plot==\nOscar ([[Nathaniel Brown]]) lives in Tokyo with his younger sister Linda ([[Paz de la Huerta]]) and supports himself by dealing drugs, against the advice of his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), who attempts to turn Oscar's interest toward ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', a Buddhist book about the afterlife. The first segment begins with Linda leaving to go to work at a local [[strip club]]) and then follows Oscar's nightly routine through strict point-of-view shots, including momentary blackouts that represent blinking, private internal thoughts, and extended sequences of a [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]-induced hallucination.\n\nNext, Alex meets Oscar at the apartment before the latter leaves to deliver drugs to his friend, Victor ([[Olly Alexander]]). On the way, Alex explains parts of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Oscar: How the spirit of a dead person sometimes stays among the living until it begins to experience nightmares, after which it attempts to reincarnate. They arrive at a bar called \"''The Void''\". Oscar enters alone and sits down with a distressed Victor, who mutters \"''I'm sorry''\" before they're swarmed by police officers. Oscar seals himself in a bathroom stall and attempts to flush his drugs. When the flush doesn't work, he yells through the door he has a gun and will shoot. In response, a police officer shoots through the door, hitting Oscar who proceeds to fall to the floor.\n\nOscar's viewpoint rises and looks at his body from above, and then we begin to witness his life in a non-chronological order. His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Oscar sleeps with his friend Victor's mother in return for extra money to help bring his sister over; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, much to Oscar's distress; Oscar increases the scope of his dealing operations and starts using potent psychedelics, such as [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], more frequently; Victor discovered that Oscar slept with his mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom.\n\nAfterwards, a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and witnesses the aftermath of his death. Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent, especially after getting an abortion; Oscar's dealer, Bruno, destroys his stash; Alex lives in hiding on the streets; and Linda wishes she had been with Alex instead of Mario, as Oscar had wanted. On one occasion, Linda wishes that Oscar would come back to life; Oscar then enters Linda's head and experiences her dream in which he wakes up at the morgue, from which his body is taken to be cremated.\n\nMeanwhile, Victor and his mother scream at each other because she had sex with Oscar, and because of that Victor had informed the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for getting her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.\n\nThe perspective now hovers high above Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds a baby Oscar. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo [[love hotel]] and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot from the perspective of a baby being born to Oscar's mother. According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's birth in the form of a false memory.<ref name=denofgeek />\n\n==Themes==\nThe cinematic experience itself is the main focus of the film, but there is also a central theme of emptiness. No\u00e9 describes the film's subject as \"the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience.\"<ref name=\"presskit interview\" /> The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wigon |first=Zachary |date=20 September 2010|url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/news-features/features/Enter_The_Void_Gaspar_Noe.html|title=Enter the Void: Gaspar No\u00e9|publisher=[[TriBeCa Productions]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417200606/http://www.tribecafilm.com/news-features/features/Enter_The_Void_Gaspar_Noe.html |archive-date=17 April 2011 |access-date=13 June 2014}}</ref> The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that \"the whole movie is a dream of someone who read ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and heard about it before being [shot by a gun].

In his early twenties\u2014while under influence of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s\u2014he saw [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]'s ''[[Lady in the Lake]]'', a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, that was the way in which it would be filmed. No\u00e9 had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the [[Andes]], France, and New York City.<ref name=\"presskit interview\">{{cite web|last=Schmerkin|first=Nicolas|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/029848.pdf|title=Interview Gaspar Noe|work=Enter the Void press kit|publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]]|access-date=30 June 2010}}</ref> Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.<ref name=denofgeek>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=21 September 2010|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/605889/gaspar_no_interview_enter_the_void_illegal_substances_and_life_after_death.html|title=Gaspar No\u00e9 Interview: Enter The Void, illegal substances and life after death|work=[[Den of Geek]]|access-date=22 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116100243/http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/film/2010-09-14/gaspar-noe-enter-the-void/ |archive-date=16 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNo\u00e9 first tried to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several producers responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for [[Tom Tykwer]]'s German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Anthony|date=25 June 2001|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_run_tykwer_run_from_lola_to_the_princess_and_the_warrior/|title=Interview: Run Tykwer Run; From Lola to 'The Princess and the Warrior'|work=[[indieWire]]|access-date=10 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016225717/http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_run_tykwer_run_from_lola_to_the_princess_and_the_warrior |archive-date=16 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=maraval>{{cite web|last=Vern|first=Romain le|date=5 May 2010|url=http://www.excessif.com/cinema/actu-cinema/dossiers/interview-vincent-maraval-enter-the-void-5841617-760.html|title=Interview Vincent Maraval (Enter The Void)|language=fr|work=Excessif|access-date=10 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180842/http://www.excessif.com/cinema/actu-cinema/dossiers/interview-vincent-maraval-enter-the-void-5841617-760.html|archive-date=16 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Prospects changed when ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]]'' (2002) became a commercial success. No\u00e9 had written and directed ''Irr\u00e9versible'' for [[StudioCanal]], and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, [[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]]. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked No\u00e9 what he wanted to do next, he answered ''Enter the Void''. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that No\u00e9 had started to develop the film for [[Path\u00e9]] instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Path\u00e9, No\u00e9 chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.<ref name=maraval />\n\n''Enter the Void'' was produced under Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 Films, with 70% of the budget invested by Wild Bunch. French co-producers included No\u00e9's company Les Cin\u00e9mas de la Zone and the visual effects studio [[BUF Compagnie]]. It received pre-sales investment from [[Canal+]] and funding from [[Eurimages]]. Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy.<ref name=companies>{{cite web|last=Lemercier|first=Fabien|date=27 April 2009|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108192|title=France driving force of international auteur film|website=Cineuropa|access-date=21 June 2010 |archive-date=7 April 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407111253/http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108192 }}</ref><ref name=cannes>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10905415/year/2009.html|title=Enter the Void|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|access-date=5 July 2010}}</ref> The total budget was 12.38 million [[euro]].<ref name=companies /> In retrospect, No\u00e9 called ''Irr\u00e9versible'' a bank robbery, a film made in order to finance ''Enter the Void''.

Since the film would be very visual, the director wanted audiences to be able to focus on the images, and not have to rely on subtitles. He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non-English speaking countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|date=15 September 2010|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/gaspar_noe_answers_to_indiewire_and_you/|title=Gaspar Noe: 'Making movies to me is like constructing a roller-coaster.'|work=IndieWire|access-date=13 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917112138/http://www.indiewire.com/article/gaspar_noe_answers_to_indiewire_and_you/ |archive-date=17 September 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe role of Linda was the first to be cast.

No\u00e9 feared that a professional actor would be frustrated by being shown almost exclusively from behind, but he felt that Brown, an aspiring director, would find it stimulating to merely be present on the set.<ref name=\"presskit interview\" /> Auditions were held for westerners living in Japan for other Tokyo-based roles. Cyril Roy went to an audition with a friend only because he wanted to talk with the director, whose previous films he admired. Roy was cast as Alex, since No\u00e9 found his talkative personality suitable for the role. No\u00e9 said about Brown and Roy:\n\n<blockquote>The thought of acting in a film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, they have a good time in front of the camera and I don't think there was a single moment where either of them felt they were working.

Later, when the director was already planning the film, he tried the psychoactive brew [[ayahuasca]], in which the active substance is DMT.

Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, despite the fact that many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue [[Intelligent lighting|programmable disco lights]], which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of [[strobe light]]s, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams.<ref name=americancinematographer /> No\u00e9 was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman.

The beginning of \"[[ANS (album)|ANS]]\" by the British band [[Coil (band)|Coil]] is heard during Oscar's first DMT trip. The [[Throbbing Gristle]] song \"Hamburger Lady\" plays as Oscar tries to deliver drugs to Victor at the bar. The soundtrack notably includes excerpts from nearly every part of [[Jean-Claude \u00c9loy]]'s two compositions, ''Sh\u00e2nti'' and ''Gaku-no-Michi''. Other songs on the soundtrack include Toshiya Tsunoda's \"Music for Baby\", [[Alvin Lucier]]'s \"Music for Gamelan Instruments, Microphones, Amplifiers and Loudspeakers\", and works by [[Denis Smalley]], [[Lullatone]], and [[Zbigniew Karkowski]].<ref name=thequietus />\n\nWhen the film premiered at film festivals, it was initially shown in a version without any credits.
