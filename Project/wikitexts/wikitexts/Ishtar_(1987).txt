The story revolves around a duo of incredibly untalented American songwriters who travel to a booking in [[Morocco]] and stumble into a four-party [[Cold War]] standoff.\n\nShot on location in Morocco and New York City by cinematographer [[Vittorio Storaro]], the production drew media attention before its release for substantial cost overruns on top of a lavish budget, and reports of clashes between May, Beatty, and Storaro. A change in studio management at [[Columbia Pictures]] during post-production also led to professional and personal difficulties that undermined the film's release.\n\nThe film polarized critics and became a [[Box-office bomb|notorious failure at the box office]]. Many initially considered it to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Ishtar (1987)|worst films ever made]], although critical support for the film has grown strongly since its release.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=To Wish Upon Ishtar|first=Richard|last=Brody|date=August 9, 2010|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/to-wish-upon-ishtar|magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Elaine And Erich ...

Though they are poorly received at a local open-microphone night, agent Marty Freed offers to book them as lounge singers in a hotel in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], explaining that the last act quit due to political unrest in the area. Nearly broke, both single, and without any better options, Lyle and Chuck decide to take the gig.\n\nWhen they arrive in the fictional neighboring country of Ishtar, Chuck agrees to give his passport to a mysterious woman who claims her life is in danger. She promises to meet him in Marrakesh. Unfortunately, Chuck learns at the U.S. Embassy that it will take longer than expected to get a new passport. Lyle goes to Morocco in a bid to save their booking while Chuck stays behind.\n\nAlone in Ishtar, Chuck meets [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Jim Harrison. Chuck agrees to be a mole for the CIA and, in return, Harrison gets Chuck to Morocco by the next evening.\n\nNow together again, Chuck and Lyle unwittingly become involved in a plot to overthrow the [[Emir]] of Ishtar. The mysterious woman, Shirra Assel, sneaks into Lyle's room and tries to steal his luggage, mistaking it for Chuck's. At the airport, she had stuck some of her items into Chuck's luggage, since that was her only way of smuggling them out of Ishtar. She later breaks into their room and goes through Chuck's luggage, but she fails to find an ancient, prophetic map that her archaeologist brother Omar had found. Shirra needs this map in order to command the loyalties of the left-wing guerrillas who oppose the government of Ishtar.\n\nShirra later confronts Chuck and accuses him of working with the CIA, and Chuck accuses her of being a communist. Meanwhile, Lyle attempts to find a camel salesman named Mohamad and gives him the secret code of \"I want to buy a blind camel,\" as per Shirra's instructions, but Lyle finds the wrong Mohamad and ends up actually buying a blind camel. Chuck and Lyle receive instructions from both the CIA and the leftist guerillas to go into the desert, and both parties actually intend for them to die there.\n\nIn the desert, Chuck pulls his jacket over his head to shield himself from the sun, and Lyle sees that the legendary map is sewn inside of the jacket. The jacket was originally Omar's, but Shirra took it, and then Chuck and Shirra traded jackets. The CIA sends helicopters to finish off Chuck and Lyle, but Shirra and a cab driver arrive in the desert and defend them.\n\nChuck and Lyle mail the map to their agent Marty Freed, who blackmails the CIA with the map. The CIA ends up having to support Shirra leading social reforms in the country, and back an album written by ''Rogers and Clarke'' with a tour starting in Morocco. At the show, Shirra is in the audience. Meanwhile, a military officer orders the rest of the men in uniform that make up the audience to \"APPLAUD!\" when the songs are finished.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Chuck Clarke\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as Lyle Rogers\n* [[Isabelle Adjani]] as Shirra Assel\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Jim Harrison\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Marty Freed\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Willa Rogers\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Carol\n* [[Aharon Ipal\u00e9]] as Emir Yousef\n* [[Fred Melamed]] as the [[Qaid|Caid]] of Assari\n* Fuad Hageb as Abdul\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mr. Clarke\n* Rose Arrick as Mrs. Clarke\n* Julie Garfield as Dorothy\n* [[Bill Bailey (American actor)|Bill Bailey]] as General Westlake\n* [[Cristine Rose|Christine Rose]] as Siri Darma \n* [[Matt Frewer]] as a CIA agent\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as an English gunrunner\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Warren Beatty]] felt indebted to [[Elaine May]], who, in addition to co-writing his 1978 hit ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', had done a major [[WGA screenwriting credit system|uncredited]] rewrite on the script of his Academy Award-winning ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' and helped immensely with its post-production. He began looking for a project that she could write and direct. She had never, he believed, had a sufficiently protective producer, and by starring in and producing her next film he could give her the chance to make the film he believed her to be creatively and commercially capable of making.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\">{{Cite journal |last1=Biskind |first1=Peter |author-link=Peter Biskind |date=February 2010|title=Madness in Morocco: The Road to ''Ishtar'' |journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |pages=116\u201325, 142\u201344 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/02/ishtar-excerpt-201002}}</ref>\n\nAt a dinner with Beatty and [[Bert Fields]], their agent, May said she would like to do a variant on the ''[[Road to ...]]'' films of [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]], set in the Middle East. Her idea would feature Beatty and a co-star as a mediocre singer-songwriter duo who would go to [[Morocco]] and get caught in the crossfire between the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and a local left-wing guerrilla group. She thought it would be funny to cast Beatty against type as the Hope part, the bumbler of the duo, while the co-star, possibly [[Dustin Hoffman]], would play the self-assured ladies' man that Crosby usually portrayed.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nHoffman, who was also indebted to May for her extensive uncredited rewrite on ''[[Tootsie]]'', initially turned it down due to \"misgivings\". At Beatty's request, the two met with May and Hoffman's creative confidant, playwright [[Murray Schisgal]]. The latter two felt that the plot in Morocco overwhelmed the rest of the film and that it \"should not leave New York\". Hoffman was finally persuaded by Beatty's assurances that he would provide May with the room she needed to work.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nWhen May finished the script, Beatty, Hoffman, and some other friends including [[Charles Grodin]] had a meeting and read-through at Beatty's house. All present agreed that the script needed work, but it was funny and could be a hit.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\">{{Cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=David |author-link=David Blum|date=March 16, 1987|title=The Road to 'Ishtar': How Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, and Elaine May Made a Farce in the Desert for Just $40 Million |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |pages=34\u201343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOQCAAAAMBAJ&q=Ishtar%2Bdunes&pg=PA34 }}</ref>\n\nBeatty went to [[Columbia Pictures]] production head [[Guy McElwaine]], who years before had been his publicist,<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" /> instructing Fields, \"Bert, anything she wants. Period. That's my negotiating position.\" Despite the prospect of having two major stars on the same project with a well-regarded writer, McElwaine did not immediately approve it. He worried about the effects of having Beatty, Hoffman, and May on the same set since they were all known to be perfectionists. May, in particular, had a reputation for shooting as much raw footage as Beatty himself or [[Stanley Kubrick]]. But McElwaine was also afraid the property could be a hit for another studio if Columbia passed,<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> since Beatty had a solid record of commercial success in his four movies as producer and star.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\nThe two bankable stars and May received $12.5&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|1={{inflation|US|12500000|1984|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}){{inflation-fn|US}} in salaries before [[principal photography]] began. Beatty and Hoffman offered to defer theirs, but Columbia declined; Fields said that an agreement the studio had with [[HBO]] covered most of that cost. Beatty, Hoffman, and May all had [[Final cut privilege|final cut]] input as well (although Beatty has denied this).<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> The film's original budget was set at $27.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\nOther roles were cast through connections to the three. Grodin was a friend of May and had starred in a successful comedy she directed, the original version of ''[[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|The Heartbreak Kid]].'' [[Isabelle Adjani]], who played the female lead disguised as a boy for most of the film, was Beatty's girlfriend at the time.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> [[Vittorio Storaro]] replaced original [[cinematographer]] [[Giuseppe Rotunno]] when Rotunno was unable to change his schedule to accommodate a delay in shooting.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\n[[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] began working on the songs the lead duo would sing. \"The real task was to write songs that were believably bad. It was one of the best jobs I've ever had in my life. I've never had more fun on a picture, but I've never worked harder.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crazedfanboy.com/spotlight/paulwilliams.html |title=The Paul Williams interview |access-date=February 10, 2007 |author=A. Smith, Michael }}</ref> May preferred that Williams write whole songs, even if she intended to use only a few lines, and then teach them to the stars and have them perform them, necessitating more time and money.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ishtarthemovie.com/InTheirWords-PW.php |title=Ishtar: The Movie/Film \u2013 In Their Words: Paul Williams |author=IshtarTheMovie.com }}</ref>\n\nThe studio had wanted to shoot the desert scenes in the Southwestern United States in order to keep costs down and production under control. But Columbia's parent company at the time, [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], had money in Morocco it could not repatriate, so the studio relented and allowed production to take place in the real [[Sahara Desert]]. It was expected that shooting in Morocco would take ten weeks, after which the New York scenes would be shot.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\n''Ishtar'' began [[principal photography]] in October 1985, amidst high political tensions in North Africa. Israeli warplanes had [[Operation Wooden Leg|just bombed]] [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] headquarters in [[Tunis]] and, seven days later, the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] hijacked a cruise ship, the ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'', murdering a wheelchair-using elderly [[Jewish American]], [[Leon Klinghoffer]]. The [[Moroccan military]] was fighting the [[Polisario Front]] guerrillas at the time as well. There were rumors that Palestinian terrorists might try to kidnap Hoffman, and some locations had to be checked for [[land mine]]s before the shooting could begin.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nThere were also production difficulties. The filmmakers appreciated the Moroccans' hospitality and willingness to cooperate, but there was no one in the country with experience supporting a major Hollywood film production. Requests by the producers were sometimes unfulfilled, and calls for local [[extra (actor)|extras]] led to thousands of people showing up.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nSome of the film's production woes have become Hollywood lore. The film's animal trainer went looking for a blue-eyed camel in the [[Marrakech]] market and found one he considered perfect. But he chose not to buy it right away, expecting he could find others and use that knowledge to bargain with the first trader for a better price. He did not realize that blue-eyed camels were rare, and could not find another camel good enough. He returned to the first trader, who had since eaten the camel.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nAnother frequently related incident, as told by [[production designer]] [[Paul Sylbert]] but disputed by others on the film, concerns the dunes where scenes with Beatty and Hoffman lost in the desert would be shot. Sylbert had scouted dunes in the United States and Morocco but none seemed to fit the vision of May, who was very uncomfortable in the desert environment. She suffered from toothaches that she refused to have treated locally, and took extensive measures to shelter herself from the harsh sun, not only spending much of her time under a large parasol but wearing large sunglasses and wrapping her face in a white gauze veil, to the point that her appearance was compared to a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]]. After one unsuccessful search for dunes, Sylbert says, May suddenly announced she wanted a flat landscape instead.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> It took ten days to level an area of a square mile (2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2).<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\nMay feuded with others on set as well. She and Storaro frequently differed over camera placements, since she was looking for the ideal comic effect while the cinematographer, who had little experience making comedies,<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" /> sought the most ideal [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. Beatty often took Storaro's side in disputes between him and May. \"She probably felt ganged up on by the two of them,\" Hoffman observed later on. Eventually, Beatty and May began quarreling, and Hoffman sometimes served as the mediator. He claims there were times when the two were not speaking to each other. May also did not get along with Adjani, which adversely affected the latter's relationship with Beatty.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nThe director remained aloof from the film's editing staff, taking copious notes during [[dailies]] but refusing to share them. As Columbia had feared, she shot a large amount of film as well, reportedly in one instance calling for fifty takes of vultures landing next to Beatty and Hoffman.<ref name=\"Maslin NYT review\">{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|author-link=Janet Maslin|title=Hoffman and Beatty in Elaine May's 'Ishtar'|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE4D81630F936A25756C0A961948260|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1987|access-date=January 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nExpenses continued to grow. \"This was the kind of film where nobody would say 'Sorry, we can't afford that,'\" according to Mac Brown, who monitored the budget. When a replacement part was needed for a camera, it was sent over to Morocco with a New York-based location coordinator instead of just being shipped, out of fear it might get lost or held up at customs. The coordinator's airfare and a week's hotel stay were paid for by the production.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\nPrivately, both Beatty and May began to confess they had made a mistake. \"I was going to give this gift to Elaine, and it turned out to be the opposite,\" Hoffman recalls Beatty telling him. Matters came to a head when it came time to shoot the film's climactic battle scenes. They were far outside May's background in [[improvisational theatre]], and during a confrontation with Beatty, May said, \"You want it done? ''You'' shoot it!\" Many crew members said that, on any other film, the director would have been fired. Beatty knew that if he called her bluff, he would have had to finish directing the film, which would have been a major embarrassment given that his main objective in making the film was to give May the chance she had never had. He compromised by scaling back the battle scenes.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nWhen the film returned to New York, Beatty told then-Columbia CEO [[Fay Vincent]] that May could not direct. But he rejected another suggestion to fire her, citing his image as a supporter of women's rights. Vincent said he would do it, but Beatty said if he did then he and Hoffman would leave the uncompleted film as well. He proposed instead that every scene be shot twice, his way and May's, effectively doubling the movie's cost.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nAfter a month-long break, the New York scenes were shot in early 1986, at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] and various locations. Due to union work rules, Storaro's Italian crew had to be doubled by a local standby crew, who were usually not needed but drew full pay for the entire shoot. It was also necessary to stop production for several days so Beatty and Hoffman could rehearse their songs.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\nIn April 1986, a month after principal photography wrapped, Vincent fired McElwaine.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> His replacement as head of the production was [[David Puttnam]], producer of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' and a longtime critic of Hollywood budgetary excesses. Among those films he had specifically criticized in the latter category was ''Reds'', singling out Beatty in particular. He had also publicly criticized Hoffman for allegedly using his star power to force rewrites to the 1979 film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]],'' which had promoted his minor character to a lead. After quitting as a producer of that film, Puttnam called Hoffman \"the most malevolent person I have ever worked with\".<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nDue to his history with both stars, the new studio head promised to stay out of ''Ishtar''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[post-production]], but Beatty and Hoffman felt that move was subtly intended to undermine the film by suggesting it was a failure for which he wanted to avoid responsibility. They worried it would hurt the film when it was released before Christmas 1986.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nInterpersonal difficulties from Morocco continued in post-production. May was supposed to direct actors when they [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|looped]] their lines in a recording studio, but sometimes left the job to Beatty or one of the editors. Most of those absences were in sessions with Adjani, who was required to lower her voice since her character had to pass as a boy for most of the film. This strained her relationship with Beatty even more.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nThe film's raw footage before editing, known as 'rushes', came to 108 hours, more than three times that typical for a comedy. Three teams of editors, one each for Beatty, Hoffman, and May worked almost continuously to produce cuts of the film to each principal's liking. Since McElwaine, whom he had tried to please as a friend, was no longer in charge, Beatty eventually relented to letting May cut the film her way, partly because he detested Puttnam and believed he was leaking negative information about ''Ishtar'' to the media. \"Just tell the asshole to keep paying the bills,\" he is reported to have told another Columbia executive. The costs, which Puttnam had believed would come under control in post-production, instead continued to mount.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nEventually, it became clear the film would not be ready in time for Christmas. When the release date of late spring of 1987 was announced, later than had been expected, stories in the media about the film's troubles increased. Industry insiders began to refer to it as ''The Road to Ruin''<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" /> and ''Warrensgate'', after the expensive 1980 flop ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''. Beatty, who had kept the media off the set during production, took these gibes personally. He and May began to fight more frequently in the editing room.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" />\n\nFinally, with the new release date looming, Bert Fields was called in to mediate between the director and stars. Beatty denies this, but Fields and others say he was present in the editing room. The agent has been described as having final cut, although he claims that was May's. Tensions continued as Beatty was trying to placate Adjani and lobbied for more footage of her. When they were finished, the editors were furious as no one had gone over the complete film.<ref name=\"Biskind VF excerpt\" /> Beatty refused to show Puttnam the final cut.<ref name=\"1987 NY mag Blum story\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nNegative buzz about ''Ishtar'' and its high budget was widespread in the press long before the film ever reached theaters. In an interview with Elaine May, [[Mike Nichols]] described the bomb as \"the prime example that I know of in Hollywood of studio suicide\",<ref name=\"conversation\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/ja06/elainemay.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017112821/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/ja06/elainemay.htm| title=Elaine May in conversation with Mike Nichols| archive-date=October 17, 2006| access-date=January 27, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref> implying that Puttnam sandbagged the project by leaking negative anecdotes to the media because of his grudges against Beatty and Hoffman.<ref name=\"chat\" /> Before release, market research led Columbia to believe the film would fail. Its head of marketing, Peter Sealey, advised the studio to minimize its losses by cutting the film's advertising budget.
