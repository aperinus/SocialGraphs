Starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Jessica Lange]], it is the fourth adaptation of [[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|the 1934 novel]] by [[James M. Cain]]. The film was shot in [[Santa Barbara, California]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Chambers ([[Jack Nicholson]]) a [[Drifter (person)|drifter]], stops at a [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[rural]] California [[diner]] in the hills outside Los Angeles for a meal and ends up working there. The diner is operated by a young, beautiful woman, Cora Smith ([[Jessica Lange]]), and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis ([[John Colicos]]), a hardworking but unimaginative immigrant from Greece.\n\nFrank and Cora start to have an affair soon after they meet. Cora is tired of her situation, married to an older man she does not love, and working at a diner that she wishes to own and improve. She and Frank scheme to murder Nick to start a new life together without her losing the diner. Their first attempt at the murder is a failure, but they succeed with their second attempt.\n\nThe local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on one another, he tries only Cora for the crime.\n\nAlthough they turn against each other, a clever ploy from Cora's lawyer, Katz ([[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]]), prevents Cora's full confession from coming into the hands of the prosecutor. With the tactic having failed to generate any new evidence for the prosecution, Cora benefits from a deal in which she pleads guilty to [[manslaughter]] and is sentenced to probation.\n\nMonths later, Frank has an affair with Madge Gorland ([[Anjelica Huston]]) while Cora is out of town. When Cora returns, she tells Frank she is pregnant. That night, Katz's assistant, Kennedy ([[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]]), appears at their door and threatens to expose them unless they give him $10,000. Enraged, Frank beats Kennedy up and strong-arms him into giving up the evidence against them.\n\nWhen Frank returns, he finds that Madge has been to see Cora, who threatens to turn him in. They eventually patch together their tumultuous relationship and now plan for a future together. However, on the way back after having been married, Cora dies in a car accident while Frank is driving. Frank weeps over Cora's body.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] \u2013 Frank Chambers\n* [[Jessica Lange]] \u2013 Cora Smith/Papadakis\n* [[John Colicos]] \u2013 Nick Papadakis\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] \u2013 Mr. Katz\n* [[John P.

They also believed the ending was \"very weak\" compared to the original film. They also criticized that the meaning of the title is not explained in the remake, which led to confusion among viewers. Jack Nicholson later said \"If you ran a question through this industry about ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'', most people would surmise that it wasn't successful. That is not true. I know it made money, because I received overages, so it must've grossed about as much as ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' and much more than ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]''. But people are anxious to disqualify it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/interview-jack-nicholson/|title=Interview: Jack Nicholson|first=Beverly|last= Walker|date=May\u2013June 1985|website=Film Comment}}</ref>\n\nThe film has since been received more favorably; it scores a 79% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with 11 positive reviews and three negative. Kerry Segrave and Linda Martin praised the \"charged chemistry\" between Nicholson and Lange, and stated that Nicholson admitted that he was smitten with his co-star, remarking that she was a \"big consensus movie sex bomb\".<ref name=\"SegraveMartin1990\">{{cite book|last1=Segrave|first1=Kerry|last2=Martin|first2=Linda|title=The post-feminist Hollywood actress: biographies and filmographies of stars born after 1939|url=https://archive.org/details/postfeministholl0000segr|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-89950-387-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/postfeministholl0000segr/page/174 174]}}</ref> The film was nominated by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2002 for the\n[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions Nominees |access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n\nThe star of the 1946 version, [[Lana Turner]], did not watch the remake, but said she had seen advertisements and blurbs on television that made her sick: she resented how the studio \"turned it into such pornographic trash\".<ref>{{cite interview|work=[[The Phil Donahue Show]]|interviewer=Lana Turner|date=1982|title=Lana Turner Full Interview}} {{YouTube|uhu6_V7pNL0}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n[[Warner Bros.
