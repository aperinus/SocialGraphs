One day her sister, Jeanine, urges her to break out of her rut and have a fling.\n\nAt a grocery store, Marjorie allows herself to be picked up for a quick sexual tryst. Unfortunately, her lover dies during the act. Even more unfortunately, the dead man turns out to be Harry's long-absent brother Charles.\n\nComplications ensue, some of them involving a [[vertical blinds]] salesman named Nick. He was in the hallway, wanting to get into a room to install blinds so he could convince the hotel to invest in them.\n\nWhen Marjorie leaves the room, she inadvertantly both drops her wallet and leaves the door ajar. Thinking he's in luck, Nick gets to work hanging the blinds. Halfway through a pole slips, hitting the lifeless man in the bed. Feeling responsible for the man's death, he calls Marjorie as he assumes she's his wife.\n\nMarjorie goes to the hotel room to get her wallet back, and she and Nick panic, so they decide to make it look like a suicide. She writes a suicide note, and they empty bottles of pills down his throat. From home, she calls 911 to report the death. \n\nWhen police arrive, Nick is in the room and insists it must have been a prank. His brother Wilbur is a police officer investigating the case. He meets Jeanine while investigating the 911 call. They have chemistry and become involved. \n\nThe autopsy reveals the non-lethal pills in Charles's esophagus as well as possible evidence of cardiac arrest. In the meantime, Nick has confessed to accidentally hitting Charles in the head with the blind hardware. Calling a family meeting, Harry fills them in on the investigation, Jeanine bursts in, telling Marjorie about Nick protecting her  by confessing.\n\nMarjorie comes clean in front of everyone, and when Harry's family hears they attack her. He tells them to get out. Shortly after, he both leaves the practise and moves away. \n\nMonths later, things are looking up for the siblings. Nick finally becomes successful selling blinds, Wilbur has become police chief and Jeanine moves in with him. Marjorie gets the story about her, Harry and Charles published and Harry comes back after having opened his own practise to start over.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as Marjorie Turner\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Jeanine, Marjorie's sister\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Nicholas Meany\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Wilbur Meany, Nicholas's brother\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Iris Turner-Hunter, Harry's sister\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Harry Turner, Marjorie's husband\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Rose Turner, Harry's mother\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Charles Turner, Sr., Harry's father\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Charles Turner, Jr., Harry's brother\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography began on April 16, 1990, and ended on June 21, 1990.
