He dreams of a battle between [[Monkey King|Sun Wukong]] and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a [[pawn shop]] in [[Chinatown]] to buy [[wuxia]] DVDs and discovers a golden [[Jingu Bang|staff]]. On his way home, Jason is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Jason to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Jason flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff.\n\nWhen Jason regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in [[History of China|ancient China]]  under attack by soldiers. The soldiers attempt to seize his staff. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar [[L\u00fc Dongbin|Lu Yan]], a supposed \"immortal,\" who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord. The Warlord tricked the King into setting aside his magic staff, [[Ruyi Jingu Bang]], and transformed the immortal into a stone statue, but the King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about a \"Seeker\" who will find the staff and free the King. Just then, they are attacked by the Warlord's men again, but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young woman whose family was murdered by the Warlord.\n\nMeanwhile, the Warlord, upon learning about the staff, sends the witch [[List of Baifa Mon\u00fc Zhuan characters#Main characters|Ni-Chang]] to help him retrieve it in exchange for the elixir of immortality. Tripitikas, Lu and Sparrow meet the Silent Monk who joins them in their quest to free the King. As the four travel to [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Five Elements Mountain]], Lu and the Monk teach Jason [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] along the way. After crossing a desert, they encounter Ni Chang. Ni Chang offers to return Jason home in exchange for the staff. When Jason refuses, a battle ensues. Ni Chang shoots an arrow which mortally wounds Lu. Jason's team escapes and takes refuge in a monastery, where they learn that Lu is not an immortal as he claimed to be, and only the Warlord's elixir can save his life. Jason goes to the Warlord's palace alone to exchange the staff for the elixir.\n\nBecause the Warlord can only give the elixir to one of them, he orders Jason to duel Ni Chang - the winner will receive the elixir. Sparrow, the Silent Monk, and the monks from the monastery arrive to join the battle. Silent Monk fights the Warlord. Sparrow fights the witch. While the witch is distracted, Jason manages to grab the elixir and tosses it to Lu, who drinks it and recovers. Lu then fights Ni Chang on the balcony then kicks her off it. Ni Chang tries to strangle Lu Yan with her hair to climb back up to the balcony, but Lu Yan cuts her hair and causes her to fall to her death. The Monk is mortally wounded by the Warlord and passes the staff to Jason, who uses it to smash the King's statue. The King is freed and the Silent Monk is revealed to be one of the King's clones. Sparrow is killed, the Warlord is eventually stabbed by Jason after being defeated by the Monkey King and falls into a [[lava]] pit to his death. The [[Jade Emperor]], having returned from his meditation, praises Jason for fulfilling the prophecy and grants him one wish. Tripitikas asks to be returned back home.\n\nJason finds himself back in the present. He overpowers Lupo and drives the other hooligans away. Hop survives being shot and claims that he is immortal (indicating that he is actually Lu). Before the film ends, Jason is delighted to meet a woman who resembles Sparrow. Jason then continues honing his kung fu skills, while Lu narrates [[Journey to the West|the King's search for truth]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[L\u00fc Dongbin|Lu Yan]] the immortal\n* [[Jet Li]] as [[Monkey King|Sun Wukong]] / Silent Monk\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Jason Tripitikas\n* [[Liu Yifei]] as Golden Sparrow / Chinatown Girl\n* [[Collin Chou]] as [[Erlang Shen]] / Jade Warlord\n* [[Li Bingbing]] as Ni Ni Chang\n* Wang Deshun as [[Jade Emperor]]\n* Morgan Benoit as Lupo\n\n==Production details==\n===Pre-production===\n<!-- This section about the character and novel have no context to the movie.
