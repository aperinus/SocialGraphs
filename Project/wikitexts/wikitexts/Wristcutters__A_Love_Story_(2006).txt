The color is dim, there are no stars, and no one can smile. This strange realm is populated by people who have died by suicide, such as Eugene, a Russian musician who lives with his mother, father, and brother \u2013 all suicide victims. Together they waste most of their afterlives in bars, until Zia learns from a friend, Brian, that his ex-girlfriend, Desiree, took her own life shortly after Zia's death. He and Eugene take to the road to find her in Eugene's rundown car. Early on, it is revealed that Eugene's car has two idiosyncrasies, a black hole underneath the passenger seat where items that are dropped disappear forever, and broken headlights that cannot be fixed by even the most adept mechanics. On their trip, they pick up a hitchhiker, Mikal, who insists she has arrived by mistake, and is seeking the \"people in charge\" (a.k.a. the PIC) in order to be sent back.\n\nAfter a few adventures across the countryside, as the trio journey along a desolate highway, Mikal pushes a button, miraculously activating the broken headlights on Eugene's car. Shortly thereafter, they come upon a man lying in the middle of the dark highway, forcing them to veer off the road in order to avoid hitting him and wrecking the car in the process.\n\nThey discover the man, Kneller, an eccentric commune leader, had fallen asleep while looking for his dog. Kneller invites them back to his camp, where they quickly discover that minor \"miracles\" occur, as long as the campers remain apathetic about the result. The group stays with the camp longer than intended, and Zia begins to obsess over the miracles and his inability to perform them. When contrasting this to Mikal's obsession with the people in charge, she reveals that her death was an accidental overdose. Eugene meets a young woman, Nanuk, whom he romances. Just as Mikal and Zia discuss their plans to leave Kneller's camp, another camper, Yan, emerges from the woods with news that Kneller's dog has been abducted by a cult leader called \"Messiah King\". Kneller, Zia, Mikal, and Yan set off in search of King and Kneller's dog.\n\nThe group soon find themselves lost and decide to make camp for the night. Unable to sleep, Mikal and Zia discover a nearby ocean shore, where they kiss and spend the night together. In the morning, Kneller discovers them lying among a seashore of used condoms and hypodermic needles. The group eventually reaches King's camp, where they discover that King is readying himself for a \"real\" miracle \u2013 to separate his soul from his body. As Kneller confronts King, Zia discovers that Desiree is a devout cult follower, having taken her own life for the purpose of following King into the afterlife.\n\nAs King is about to perform public, ritual suicide, Kneller reveals himself to be an undercover agent for the people in charge. King and Desiree are taken away, while Mikal leaves with them, promising Zia that she'll return. As Zia waits, Eugene and Nanuk arrive, explaining that Mikal has been returned to life and Kneller's camp has been shut down. They depart together on a train, giving Eugene's car to Zia. After finally performing a miracle \u2013 creating a star in the sky with a lit match next to one that Mikal had created earlier \u2013 Zia decides to take the car and wander. While he is turning over the cassette tape to place in the stereo it accidentally falls into the passenger side feet area. He reaches for it and enters the black hole under the car seat.\n\nIn a large warehouse filled with halls of boxes, Kneller picks up Zia's file from a box, places it into his inside breast pocket, and comments on how fortunate it is to know people in high places. Zia wakes up in a hospital bed. He turns his head, seeing his parents outside talking to doctors. When he looks at the person in the bed next to his, he sees Mikal. Both look at each other and smile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as Zia\n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as Mikal\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Eugene\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Desiree Randolph\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Kneller\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Messiah King\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Cop\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Eugene's mother\n* Anatol Rezmeritza as Eugene's father\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Yan\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Brian\n* Mikal P.

The consensus reads, \"''Wristcutters: A Love Story'' sounds like a normal enough indie flick.  Boy meets girl.  Boy gets separated from girl.  Boy goes on a road trip with friends to find girl and gains a new perspective on life.
