The second film directed by, written by, and starring [[Josh Radnor]], it tells the story of 35-year-old Jesse (Radnor) who has a romantic relationship with Zibby ([[Elizabeth Olsen]]), a 19-year-old college student.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film's plot|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2011/director-josh-radnor-majoring-in-liberal-arts-with-elizabeth-olsen/|publisher=Firstshowing.net|accessdate=September 20, 2015}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Sundance Film Festival|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120029/liberal_arts|publisher=Filmguide.sundance.org|accessdate=September 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071634/http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120029/liberal_arts|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJesse Fisher (Radnor), a 35-year-old college admissions officer in NYC who loves literature and language, is newly single and dissatisfied with his life and career. He believes the happiest time of his life was the years at his unnamed Ohio [[liberal arts college]], where he could study uninterrupted, surrounded by others like him. Peter Hoberg (Jenkins), his former English professor, invites Jesse back to the college to attend his retirement ceremony. Jesse meets 19-year-old Zibby (Olsen), a sophomore studying drama and the daughter of Peter's friends.\n\nAfter the retirement dinner, Jesse stumbles upon a campus party where he runs into Zibby. They agree to have coffee together the next day. He spends the afternoon with her, walking around the campus discussing life, books, and music. He also encounters his old [[Romantic era|romantics]] teacher, Judith Fairfield (Janney)&mdash;a woman he has long admired&mdash;and meets the eccentric Nat (Efron), and Dean (Magaro), a brilliant but depressed student who, like Jesse, always carries a book with him.<ref name=\"infinitejest\">[http://bulletin.kenyon.edu/x4099.xml According to Radnor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505020340/http://bulletin.kenyon.edu/x4099.xml |date=May 5, 2013 }}, the book Dean carries is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.</ref>\n\nBefore Jesse leaves, Zibby asks to stay in touch through hand-written letters and they become closer. Meanwhile, Peter feels lost facing his upcoming retirement, and goes to the dean to ask to stay on. He is told that they have already hired his replacement.\n\nZibby invites Jesse back to campus, hinting that she has feelings for him. Jesse has concerns about the 16-year age gap, but agrees. They spend time together and kiss. When Peter sees them together, however, he encourages Jesse to date women his own age. Zibby confesses her feelings to Jesse and asks him to sleep with her; he agrees, but changes his mind after she admits that she is a virgin. Zibby is insulted and hurt and asks him to leave. Jesse goes to a bar where he meets Fairfield again. They have a one-night stand, but afterwards she tells him to grow up and kicks him out. Meanwhile, Zibby goes to a party and kisses a classmate. Jesse leaves without seeing Zibby again, but says goodbye to Peter.\n\nJesse returns to New York and, some months later, writes to Zibby again. He apologizes for hurting her, says that he misses her and credits her for helping him to grow. He meets and starts dating Ana (Reaser), a bookseller his own age with a similar love for books. After Jesse helps avert Dean's suicide by [[overdose]], he advises the young man to stop [[Avoidance coping|hiding from life]] within books.\n\nJesse goes to see Zibby and apologizes to her again. She says that she had hoped to take a shortcut to adulthood through a relationship with Jesse, and that she understands that what he did was the right thing. Jesse goes back home and renews his correspondence with Zibby. The film ends with Zibby lying down reading ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' which she received via courier from Jesse, and Ana lying on Jesse's chest, them happily talking about growing old.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Radnor]] as Jesse Fisher\n* [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as Elizabeth \"Zibby\"\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Peter Hoberg, a retiring professor\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Judith Fairfield, a romantics professor\n* [[John Magaro]] as Dean, a depressed student\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Nat, an eccentric student\n* [[Elizabeth Reaser]] as Ana, a bookseller\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Susan, Zibby's mother\n* [[Robert Desiderio]] as David, Zibby's father\n* [[Gregg Edelman]] as Robert\n* [[Michael Weston]] as Miles, Jesse's friend (in deleted scenes)\n\n==Filming==\nThe majority of scenes were filmed at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].

The consensus states: \"While it's hard not to wish it had a little more bite, ''Liberal Arts'' ultimately succeeds as a good-natured -- and surprisingly clever -- look at the addictive pull of nostalgia for our youth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/liberal_arts/ |title=Liberal Arts (2012) |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 25, 2020}}</ref> The film also has a score of 55 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 24 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/liberal-arts |title=Liberal Arts Reviews |website= [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=September 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''  gave the film 3 and a half out of 4 stars and stated in his review:\n\n: \"''Liberal Arts'' is an almost unreasonable pleasure about a jaded New Yorker who returns to his alma mater in Ohio and finds that his heart would like to stay there. It's the kind of film that appeals powerfully to me; to others, maybe not so much.\n\n: There is a part of me that will forever want to be walking under autumn leaves, carrying a briefcase containing the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]] and a portable chess set. I will pass an old tree under which once on a summer night I lay on the grass with a fragrant young woman and we quoted [[E. E. Cummings|e.e. cummings]] back and forth. There is a word to explain why this particular film so appealed to me. Reader, that word is \"escapism.\" If you understand why I used the word \"reader\" in just that way, you are possibly an ideal viewer for this movie.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Tallerico |first=Brian |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/liberal-arts-2012 |title=Liberal Arts Movie Review & Film Summary (2012) |publisher=Roger Ebert |accessdate=September 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1872818}}\n\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Josh Radnor]]\n[[Category:2010s coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
