It also stars [[Talia Shire]], [[Burt Young]], [[Carl Weathers]], and [[Burgess Meredith]]. In the film, [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone), struggling to adjust to family life, finds himself in a rematch fiercely demanded by [[Apollo Creed]] (Weathers). \n\nDevelopment of ''Rocky II'' began in 1977, after Stallone completed the screenplay. [[United Artists]] were reluctant to allow Stallone to direct after [[John G. Avildsen]], the director of the first film, was unable to return. Stallone was eventually hired after disallowing the film to be made without him as director, and the returns of the rest of the cast was secured soon thereafter. [[Principal photography]] commenced in 1978, with filming held primarily on location in [[Philadelphia]], during which, Stallone sustained several injuries.\n \n''Rocky II'' was theatrically released in the United States by United Artists on June 15, 1979. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its characterization, finale, and Stallone's performance. It grossed $200 million worldwide and $85 million in North America, making it the third [[1979 in film#United States and Canada|highest-grossing film of 1979]] domestically. The sequel, ''[[Rocky III]]'', was released in 1982.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nOn New Year's Day in 1976, world heavyweight boxing champion [[Apollo Creed]] has successfully defended his title in a split decision against challenger [[Rocky Balboa]]. He and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Despite their mutual agreement not to seek a rematch, Apollo challenges Rocky again to prove that Rocky going the distance with him was a fluke, but Rocky declines and retires from [[professional boxing]]. Balboa's girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice as do his doctors who go on to reveal that Rocky will require surgery for a [[retinal detachment|detached retina]], a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his newfound celebrity status. An agent sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after Adrian reveals that she is pregnant.\n\nMeanwhile, fuelled by hate mail claiming he fixed the fight in order to protect his reign as champ, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish Apollo demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement, despite the pleas of his friends and family that Rocky's ability to absorb punishment is too dangerous for his chances to successfully defend the title a second time.\n\nRocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of fighting again. Mickey declines out of concern for Rocky's health, but he changes his mind     after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky insists that he knows nothing else so this is the only way he can provide for them. Adrian, disappointed at the fact that Rocky broke his promise, refuses to support him.\n\nRocky and Mickey begin training but Rocky is unfocused due to Adrian's disapproval. Adrian's brother, Paulie, confronts his sister about not supporting her husband. Adrian faints during the confrontation and is rushed to the hospital where she goes into labor. Despite being born premature the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened and refuses to leave her bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until the baby can be together with his mother. When Adrian comes out of her coma she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple are soon shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert \"Rocky Jr\". Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the fight.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, the night of the match, Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the distance was a fluke. In order to protect his vulnerable eye Rocky opts to fight right-handed rather than his natural [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]]. The change leaves him at a major disadvantage, and as a result he is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. Going into the fifteenth and final round Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However Creed wants to win by knock-out in order to erase any doubts about his superiority and ignores his trainer's pleas to stay back. In the final round Rocky switches back to his natural stance and, in dramatic fashion, unleashes a series of counter punches on Creed, and begins to turn the tide. Both men, exhausted, trade punches until Rocky is able to gain the upper hand and knocks Creed down. The blow causes Rocky to also lose his balance and fall at the same time. As both men struggle to regain their feet, Rocky is able to will himself up at the count of 9 while Apollo collapses from exhaustion, giving Rocky the win by knockout and making him the new heavyweight champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on TV: \"Yo, Adrian, I did it!\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{see also|List of Rocky characters}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": the underdog who was given one chance at winning the heavyweight championship from Apollo Creed in the first film. Due to the public's belief that it was very possible that Rocky could have won, he gets a second shot at the title in this film.\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's love interest-turned-wife. During labor, with their first son, she enters a coma for a large portion of the film.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's best-friend-turned-brother-in-law\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: The current world heavyweight champion who gave Rocky a shot at the title in the first film, during which he won by split-decision. Because of the close outcome of the fight the general public believes that Apollo did not necessarily win, and thus he gives Rocky a second chance in a rematch.\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill|Michael \"Mickey\" Goldmill]]: Rocky's friend, manager and trainer; a former [[bantamweight]] fighter from the 1920s and the owner of the local boxing gym.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer, and manager.\n* Sylvia Meals as [[List of Rocky characters#Mary Anne Creed|Mary Anne Creed]]: Apollo Creed's wife.\n* Seargeoh Stallone as [[List of Rocky characters#Robert Balboa, Jr.|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa, Jr.]]: Rocky and Adrian's newborn child.

Appearing as themselves are referee [[Lou Filippo]] and commentators [[Brent Musburger]], [[Stu Nahan]] and Bill Baldwin. [[LeRoy Neiman]] makes an uncredited non-speaking cameo appearance during the training scenes in the film; he is shown drawing a picture of Apollo while he is training.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n\nAfter the enormous success of the first ''[[Rocky]]'', the producers were anxious to make a sequel. Stallone again wrote the script, originally titled ''Rocky II: Redemption'', but John G. Avildsen declined to direct again because he was busy with pre-production on ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. Stallone wanted the job and waged as big a campaign as he had for the lead role in the previous film. United Artists executives were reluctant to give the actor the directing reins because, while he had previously directed the drama ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', it was not a success. However, producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff understood how much of the success of the first ''Rocky'' had come from Stallone's enormous input and lobbied hard to get him the job.\n\n===Filming===\nThe story development of involving Rocky surprising Creed by switching to fighting right-handed was not in the original script and only came about because of an accident onset. While getting in shape for the film, Stallone experienced an almost complete tear on his right pectoralis major muscle while trying to bench press 100 kg with bodybuilder [[Franco Columbu]] and underwent a partially successful surgery in order to try to reattach the muscle. Therefore, he could not fight with his right hand.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/13/archives/rocky-fights-it-over-sports-of-the-times.html|title=Rocky Fights It over|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/491907/sylvester-stallones-aging-physique|title=Sylvester Stallone's aging physique}}</ref>\n\nThe film's ending fight sequence also posed a challenge because at the time Talia Shire was busy making the drama ''[[Old Boyfriends]]'' and couldn't be on the set. So Stallone came up with the idea of having her watch the fight from home because of the new baby. Adrian's scenes were actually filmed some months later, toward the end of the shoot.{{cn|date =November 2021}}\n\nAn estimated 800 school children were used as [[extra (actor)|extras]] in the scene in which Rocky runs through Philadelphia<ref>{{cite news\n| first = Janet\n| last = Maslin\n| title = Screen: 'Rocky II' Fights a Rematch: Second Stanza....\n| url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=2&title1=&title2=Rocky%20II%20%28Movie%29&reviewer=JANET%20MASLIN&v_id=41859&pdate=19790615&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&oref=slogin&oref=login\n| format = Subscription required\n| work = [[The New York Times]]\n| date = 1979-06-15\n}}</ref> and climbs the [[Rocky Steps]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Rocky II: Music by Bill Conti\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Bill Conti]]\n| cover      = ROCKYIIOST.jpeg\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1979\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Jazz-funk]], [[Rock music|Rock]]\n| length     = 35:04\n| label      = [[United Artists Records]] \u2013 LP <br>[[EMI Manhattan Records]] \u2013 CD\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' soundtrack\n | type       = Film\n | prev_title = [[Rocky: Original Motion Picture Score]]\n | prev_year  = 1976\n | title      = Rocky II: Music by Bill Conti\n | year       = 1979\n | next_title = [[Rocky III: Original Motion Picture Score]]\n | next_year  = 1982\n}}\n}}\nJust as in the previous installment, [[Bill Conti]] composed the film's music.
