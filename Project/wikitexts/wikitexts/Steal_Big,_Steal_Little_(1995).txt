They were orphans raised by a rich landowner named Clifford Downey and his dancer wife, Mona Rowland-Downey.\n\nUpon her death, Mona leaves her entire {{convert|40000|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], California in the care of only one son, Ruben. The other brother begins plotting how to win control of the property away from his estranged twin.\n\nRuben's main concern at the moment is that his wife Laura has left him. She cannot comprehend how her loving husband could have cheated on her with another woman.\n\nRuben tracks her to [[Chicago]], where he meets used-car salesman Lou Perilli. He is assured that Laura will come back to him eventually. In the meantime, being pursued by a tough customer named Nick Zangaro about a debt he owes, Lou decides to make a quick getaway out west to Santa Barbara.\n\nEddie Agopian, a family lawyer, is in charge of watching over Ruben's interests. But suddenly he disappears. Local authorities, including Sheriff Otis and a corrupt judge, have begun harassing Ruben and the dozens of workers and friends who live at the ranch. They are the stooges of powerful businessman Reed Tyler, who has business interests with Ruben's brother, Robby.\n\nLou becomes a partner to the timid Ruben by promising to help him with his legal troubles. Lou has no lawyer experiences, but begins doing some investigating on Ruben's behalf and does the best he can in court. He also helps Ruben track down Eddie, who has absconded to Mexico with a stash of money.\n\nA scam is exposed, revealing to Laura that it was not her husband who had relations with another woman but Robby, his evil twin. Ruben, Laura and Lou quickly hatch a scheme of their own, catching the sheriff and judge in compromising positions and luring Robby into one with the help of a couple of young women hired for the occasion.\n\nThe relationship between the brothers is healed a bit, if not completely, by the end as Ruben finds happiness at the ranch with his wide assortment of friends and family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Ruben Martinez/Robby Martin\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Lou Perilli\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Laura\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Eddie Agopian\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Mona\n* [[Ally Walker]] as Bonnie Martin\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Nick Zangaro\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Judge Myers\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Sheriff Otis\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Reed Tyler\n* [[Candice Daly]] as Melissa\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received poor reviews from critics and was a box office failure.
