(also known as \"RoGoPaG\") is a [[1963 in film|1963]] [[film]] consisting of four segments, each written and directed by a different director. These include the French director [[Jean-Luc Godard]] (segment \"Il Nuovo mondo\") and the Italian directors [[Ugo Gregoretti]] (segment \"Il Pollo ruspante\"), [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (segment \"[[La Ricotta]]\") and [[Roberto Rossellini]] (segment \"Illibatezza\").\n\nThe movie title is an abbreviation of the authors' last names: '''Ro'''ssellini, '''Go'''dard, '''Pa'''solini, '''G'''regoretti.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n===''Illibatezza''===\n'''''Illibatezza''''' (\"Chastity\") by [[Roberto Rossellini]] is a story of a beautiful stewardess who attracts unwanted attention from one of the air travelers \u2013 a middle aged American. By chance, the two stay in the same hotel overnight. She has a fianc\u00e9 back home, to whom she sends 8mm films made with her camera. These show how, in order to shoo away the unwanted flirtatious attentions of the traveler, all she had to do was to act in an aggressively provocative way; his sexual attraction being fueled by the shyness with which she initially tried to endure his advances.\n\n===''Il nuovo mondo''===\n'''''Il nuovo mondo''''' (\"The New World\") by [[Jean-Luc Godard]] is set in [[Paris]] and shows a young couple during a short period after the explosion of a nuclear bomb 120&nbsp;km over Paris. The city is unaffected by it but the man begins to notice changes in the behaviour of the people in general and in that of his girl friend in particular in the period after the explosion: e.g. her inability to keep up a coherent conversation and a loss of logic. He himself is not affected, but does not know why. The media reports that the explosion has not resulted in negative after effects. The man realizes this is not true and decides to write down his observations.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n===''La ricotta''===\n{{main|La ricotta}}\n[[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini's]] ''La ricotta'' (\"Curd Cheese\") tells the story of filming a movie about the crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] at a slightly hilly waste ground near a residential area. The main character is a simple man playing a bit part \u2013 one of the two men who were crucified with Christ, in particular [[Saint Dismas|the one]] who asks Christ to take him in heaven. After giving his own rations to his wife and children, he finds himself hungry. Disguised in women's clothing and a wig he sneaks some more rations. Before he can eat it however  he has to film his scene and so hides it. When he gets back however, he discovers that the dog belonging to the film's star has found his hiding place. Subsequent to this he sells the dog to a reporter and buys enough curd cheese and bread to feed himself. At the end, he dies from gastric congestion on the cross while filming.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nWhen the film director ([[Orson Welles]]) is interviewed by a reporter, he calls the reporter an average man and conformist, telling him that if he should die right now, it would be a nice plot development. He then reads to the reporter from Pasolini's book titled ''[[Mamma Roma]]''.\n\n===''Il pollo ruspante''===\nGregoretti's '''''Il pollo ruspante''''' (\"Free Range Chicken\") shows an Italian middle-class family with two children traveling via an ''autostrada'' (highway) to the site of a real-estate project where they could be interested in buying a detached house.\n\nWhile they do, a laringotomized marketing executive presents a lecture to a businessmen's seminar, reciting passage after passage in an impersonal, mechanical tone through a vocalizing apparatus.\n\nThe lecturer teaches the businessmen how to \"stimulate consumption\" via the substitution of small shops (where the customer was forced to talk to the shop-owner and so was allowed time to rationalize each buying action) with large supermarkets, where people could more easily give over to their instincts, grabbing frivolous or useless articles from the shelves on a whim due to the delay of the moment of bill presentation and payment.\n\nThe family visits a highway service station with an adjoining supermarket and restaurant. In the supermarket the children clamor to have candies and toys bought for them and the parents give in for fear of \"letting people think they're poor\"; then they all sit down to consume a drab standardized meal where the father can't convince the waitress to bring him \"just one egg\" (since all the portions must contain two) and has to explain his children the difference between battery-bred chicken and free ranging ones (in itself a metaphor of regimented urban life compared to the rougher, but more free, rural existence).{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nThe family finally reaches the development site where an enthusiastic real estate agent pressures them to reserve a yet-to-be-built house while telling off the warden (a southern Italian, representing the agricultural past of Italy) for having planted cabbages and other vegetables in a small patch of land, trampling over it and destroying the plants. The lecture goes on, in a harrowing enunciation of tricks and strategies to push consumerism to ever higher heights, all exemplified ''in corpore vivo'' by the family's odyssey. Finally, when in the evening the family is getting back to Milan, the father having decided against buying the house, a car accident befalls them, probably killing them all.\n\nThe robot-voiced marketing executive concludes his exposition and is cheered by the businessmen' crowd, who congratulate him as they all leave the meeting room.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Amg movie|163256|Ro.Go.Pa.G.}}\n*{{IMDb title|0056171|Ro.Go.Pa.G.}}\n\n{{Roberto Rossellini}}\n{{Jean-Luc Godard}}\n{{Pier Paolo Pasolini}}\n\n[[Category:1963 films]]\n[[Category:Italian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roberto Rossellini]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ugo Gregoretti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carlo Rustichelli]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Italian anthology films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Angelo Rizzoli]]\n[[Category:Italian post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
