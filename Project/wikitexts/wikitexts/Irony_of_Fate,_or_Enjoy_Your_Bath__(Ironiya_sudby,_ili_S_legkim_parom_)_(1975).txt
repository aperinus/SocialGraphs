The screenplay was written by [[Emil Braginsky]] and Ryazanov, loosely based on the director's 1971 play, ''Once on New Year's Eve'' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044e\u044e \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c}}). \n\nFilmed at the [[Mosfilm]] Studios, ''The Irony of Fate'' doubles as a [[screwball comedy]] and a love story tinged with sadness. It was one of the most successful Soviet television productions and remains a highly popular [[New Year's Eve]] classic in [[Russia]] and the [[post-Soviet states]], with millions tuning in to rewatch it every New Year's Eve.\n\n==Plot==\nThe key subplot is the drab uniformity of [[History of the Soviet Union (1964\u20131982)|Brezhnev-era]] public architecture. This setting is explained in a humorous [[animation|animated]] prologue, in which architects are overruled by politicians and red tape (director and animator - [[Vitaly Peskov]]). As a result, the identical, functional but unimaginative multistory apartment buildings found their way into every city, town, and suburb across the Soviet Union.<ref>Frederick Edwin Ian Hamilton, Kaliopa Dimitrovska Andrews, Nata\u0161a Pichler-Milanovi\u0107 ''Transformation Of Cities In Central And Eastern Europe''  2005 Page 159 \"... industry started and by the early 1960s new housing districts built in five-storey blocks of modern industrialized panel construction had been established all around the socialist countries (e.g. in Moscow, popularly known as \"Kruschevki\").\"</ref>\n\nFollowing their annual tradition, a group of friends meet at a ''[[Banya (sauna)|banya]]'' (a traditional public \"sauna\" bathhouse) in [[Moscow]] to celebrate [[New Year's Eve]]. The friends all get very drunk toasting the upcoming marriage of the central male character, Zhenya Lukashin ([[Andrey Myagkov]]) to Galya ([[Olga Naumenko]]). After the bath, one of the friends, Pavlik ([[Aleksandr Shirvindt]]), has to catch a flight to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and the entire group is going to take him to the airport.  By the time the group makes it to the airport, Zhenya and Pavlik are passed out.  The remaining friends cannot remember which person from their group is supposed to travel. They mistakenly get Zhenya onto the plane instead of Pavlik.\n\nZhenya spends the entire flight sleeping on the shoulder of his annoyed seatmate (Eldar Ryazanov in a brief comedic [[cameo appearance]]). The seatmate helps Zhenya get off the plane in Leningrad. Zhenya wakes up in the Leningrad airport, believing he is still in Moscow. He stumbles into a taxi and, still quite drunk, gives the driver his address.  It turns out that in Leningrad there is an identical address that belongs to an apartment buildings of a design identical to Zhenya's building in Moscow.  He takes the elevator to \"his\" apartment and, surprisingly, the key fits in the door (as alluded to in the introductory narration, \"...building standard apartments with standard locks\"). Inside, even the furniture is nearly identical to that of Zhenya's apartment, but Zhenya is too drunk to notice any minor differences.\n\nMeanwhile, the apartment's resident, Nadya Shevelyova ([[Barbara Brylska]]), comes home and finds Zhenya asleep on her bed. To make matters worse, Nadya's fianc\u00e9, Ippolit ([[Yuriy Yakovlev (Soviet actor)|Yuri Yakovlev]]), shows up without an advance notice. Ippolit becomes furious, refuses to believe Zhenya and Nadya's explanations, and storms out. Zhenya is about to leave to get back to Moscow but circumstances make him return repeatedly. Nadya wants to get rid of Zhenya as soon as possible, but there are no flights to Moscow until the next morning.  Additionally, Zhenya tries repeatedly to call Moscow and explain to Galya what has happened. Eventually, he does contact Galya, but she is furious and hangs up on his call. Ippolit also calls Nadya's apartment and hears Zhenya answer. Although Zhenya is trying to be available to receive potential calls from Galya, Ippolit also refuses to accept the truth of the situation. Nadya goes to the railway station and buys a train ticket to Moscow for Zhenya, but he abruptly rips it up and refuses to leave.  It seems more and more clear that Zhenya and Nadya are the only two people who understand the night's circumstances.\n\nThus, Zhenya and Nadya are compelled to spend New Year's Eve together. At first, they continue to treat each other with animosity, but gradually their behavior softens, and the two fall in love. In the morning, they feel that everything that has happened to them was a delusion, and they make the difficult decision to part. With a heavy heart, Zhenya returns to Moscow. Meanwhile, Nadya reconsiders everything and, deciding that she might have let her chance at happiness slip away, takes a plane to Moscow to find Zhenya. She has no difficulty finding him as their addresses are the same, and her key matches his lock.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrey Myagkov]] as Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Lukashin, \"Zhenya\" (vocals by [[Sergey Nikitin (musician)|Sergey Nikitin]])\n* [[Barbara Brylska]] as Nadezhda Vasilyevna Shevelyova, \"Nadya\" (voiced by [[Valentina Talyzina]], vocals by [[Alla Pugacheva]])\n* [[Yury Yakovlev]] as Ippolit Georgievich, Nadya's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Lyubov Dobrzhanskaya]] as Marina Dmitriyevna, Zhenya's mother\n* [[Olga Naumenko]] as Galya, Zhenya's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Aleksandr Shirvindt]] as Pavlik, Zhenya's best friend/author's text\n* [[Georgi Burkov]] as Misha, Zhenya's friend\n* [[Valentina Talyzina]] as Valya, Nadya's friend\n* [[Liya Akhedzhakova]] as Tanya, Nadya's friend\n* [[Aleksandr Belyavsky (actor)|Aleksandr Belyavsky]] as Sasha, Zhenya's friend\n* [[Gotlib Roninson]] as man at the airport\n* [[Eldar Ryazanov]] as Zhenya's fellow passenger on board\n* [[Lyubov Sokolova (actress)|Lyubov Sokolova]] as Olga Nikolayevna, Nadya's mother\n\n==Reception==\nThe two consecutive episodes of ''The Irony of Fate'' were originally broadcast by the Soviet central television channel, [[Programme One]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vokrug.tv/product/show/Ironiya_sudby_ili_S_legkim_parom/|script-title=ru:\u0418\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0421 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c!|trans-title=The Irony of Fate| language =ru|publisher=vokrug.tv.ru|access-date=25 December 2012}}</ref> on 1 January 1976, at 18:00.<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web|url=http://market.umh.ua/files/file/download/s_legkim_parom.pdf|script-title=ru:\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f|trans-title=Almost A Christmas Tale|language=ru|author1=Krigel, Mikhailo|author2=Danilenko, Larissa|year=2012|publisher=Vidavichny Dim UMH|access-date=25 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325170736/http://market.umh.ua/files/file/download/s_legkim_parom.pdf|archive-date=25 March 2013}} p. 7.</ref> The film was a resounding success with audiences: author Fedor Razzakov recalled that \"virtually the entire country watched the show\";<ref name = \"B\">{{cite book|author=Razzakov, Fedor|title=Gibel\u02b9 sovetskogo kino|year=2008|publisher=Exmo|isbn=9785699268467}} p. 133.</ref> the [[Audience measurement|number of viewers was estimated]] to have been about 100 million.<ref>Krigel, Danilenko. p. 10.</ref> In response to popular demand, the feature had a first re-run on 7 February.
