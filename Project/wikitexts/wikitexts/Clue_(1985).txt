Directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]], who collaborated on the script with [[John Landis]], and produced by [[Debra Hill]], it stars the [[ensemble cast]] of [[Eileen Brennan]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], and [[Colleen Camp]].\n\nInspired by the nature of the board game, the film's initial release featured various different endings, with one of three possibilities sent to [[movie theater]]s at the time.

Greeted by Wadsworth the [[butler]] and Yvette the [[maid]], each guest receives a [[pseudonym]]: Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Miss Scarlet.\n\nA seventh guest arrives, Mr. Boddy, who Wadsworth reveals has been [[blackmail]]ing the others: Mrs. Peacock is accused of taking bribes for her husband, a [[United States Senate|US senator]], but denies any wrongdoing and claims she has paid the blackmail to keep the scandal quiet; Mrs. White is suspected in the death of her husband, a [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]], she denies guilt and states that she does not want the allegations made public; Professor Plum has lost his [[medical license]] due to an affair with a patient, he initially denies this; Miss Scarlet runs an underground [[brothel]] in Washington, D.C., a title she gladly flaunts; Colonel Mustard, though initially suspected of being one of Miss Scarlet's clients, is actually a [[War profiteering|war profiteer]] who sold plane parts on the black market, resulting in several deaths; Mr. Green is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], a secret he isn't ashamed of, but must keep secret as it would [[lavender scare|cost him his job]] at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] if anyone found out.\n\nWadsworth tells them that the police had been notified and they have approximately 45 minutes before they arrive.  While threatening to expose the guests if he is arrested, Mr. Boddy gives them each a [[Cluedo#Weapons|weapon]]\u2014a [[candlestick]], a [[knife]], a [[lead pipe]], a [[revolver]], a [[rope]], and a [[wrench]] and suggests that someone kill Wadsworth, who has the key to the front door and whose death will ensure that \"no one but the seven of us will ever know\" of their secrets. Mr. Boddy turns out the lights; deathly moans are heard and a gunshot rings out, and when the lights are turned back on to reveal Mr. Boddy is apparently dead, without any indication at first glance as to how.\n\nAs the guests investigate Boddy's death,  Wadsworth explains to the guests that his wife had committed suicide due to Mr. Boddy's blackmail because she refused to name friends who were [[Socialism|socialists]], forcing him to become Boddy's butler and that he has summoned the guests to force a confession out of Mr. Boddy and turn him over to the police. The group suspects the cook, but they find her dead as well, having been stabbed with the knife. Mr. Boddy's body disappears, but the guests find his now bleeding body in the bedroom, having been struck on the head with the candlestick.\n\nWadsworth locks the weapons in a cupboard. He attempts to throw the key away, but a stranded motorist arrives, and Wadsworth locks him in the [[Living room|lounge]]. While the guests search the mansion in pairs, an unknown individual burns the blackmail evidence, unlocks the cupboard and kills the motorist with the wrench. Discovering a secret passage, Colonel Mustard and Miss Scarlet find themselves locked in the lounge with the motorist's corpse until Yvette shoots the door open with the revolver.\n\nA police officer investigating the motorist's abandoned car arrives to use the phone. The mansion receives a call from [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the head of the FBI, which Wadsworth takes alone. After distracting the police officer successfully, the guests resume their search until another unknown person turns off the electricity. Yvette, the police officer, and a [[singing telegram]] girl who arrived while the lights were out are murdered with the rope, lead pipe, and revolver, respectively.\n\nWadsworth and the others regroup after he turns the electricity back on, and he reveals he knows who the murderer is. Recreating the night's events, Wadsworth explains that the five other victims were Mr. Boddy's informants. An [[Evangelism|evangelist]] interrupts the gathering, but Mrs. Peacock turns him away by slamming the door, and Wadsworth continues his explanation, with one of three possible outcomes.\n\n=== How It Might Have Happened ===\nYvette murdered the cook and Mr. Boddy on orders from Miss Scarlet, for whom she once worked as a [[call girl]]. Scarlet then killed Yvette and the other victims. Planning to sell the guests' secrets, Scarlet prepares to shoot Wadsworth, who asserts there are no more bullets, causing them to bicker over how many shots there have been, and disarms Scarlet as law enforcement raid the house. The evangelist, revealed to be the [[Chief of police|police chief]], congratulates Wadsworth \u2013 an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent. Wadsworth attempts to demonstrate the revolver was empty, but a remaining bullet brings down a chandelier, narrowly missing Colonel Mustard whilst Miss Scarlet laughs about being correct.\n\n=== How About This? ===\nMrs. Peacock killed all the victims to conceal her taking bribes from foreign powers. She holds the others at gunpoint as they allow her to leave. Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent sent to investigate her. While escaping to her car, Mrs. Peacock is surprised by the evangelist, who is revealed to be the police chief, as the police raid the property. After the police chief assures her arrest, Wadsworth asks if anyone would care for some fruit or dessert.\n\n=== What Really Happened ===\nApart from Mr. Green, everyone has killed at least one person: Professor Plum missed Mr. Boddy with the revolver but later killed him in the hall with the candlestick; Mrs. Peacock stabbed the cook, her former employee, in the Kitchen with the knife; Colonel Mustard bludgeoned the motorist, who was his driver during [[World War II]], in the lounge with the wrench; Mrs. White throttled Yvette in the billiard room with the rope out of jealousy and hatred for the latter's affair with her husband, whom she had also killed; and Miss Scarlet clubbed the cop, whom she was bribing, in the library with the lead pipe, and Wadsworth reveals that he shot the singing telegram girl (the patient Professor Plum had the affair with) in the hall with the revolver and that he is the real Mr. Boddy; the person that Professor Plum killed was Mr. Boddy's butler. With his spies and informants disposed of, he plans to continue blackmailing the guests. Mr. Green then draws his own revolver, kills Wadsworth, and reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent and that the earlier phone call from J. Edgar Hoover was for him. Green then opens the front door, bringing in the authorities to arrest the others as the evangelist is revealed to be the police chief. After telling the police chief they all did it, but he has killed Mr. Boddy in the hall with the revolver, Mr. Green reveals his homosexuality as part of his cover by saying: \"Okay, Chief, take 'em away! I'm gonna go home and sleep with my wife!\"\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Clue 1985 film cast.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3636364|Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn), Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Wadsworth (Tim Curry), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), and Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan)]]\n{{main|List of Cluedo characters}}\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as [[List of Cluedo characters#Mrs. Peacock|Mrs. Peacock]], the wife of a U.S. Senator who is accused of taking bribes.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as [[List of Cluedo characters#The Butler|Wadsworth]], a butler who once worked for Mr. Boddy and is seeking justice for his wife.

He was motivated by his desire for perfection. Having failed to be either the perfect husband or the perfect butler, he decided to be the perfect murderer instead. Wadsworth reports that he poisoned the champagne the guests had drunk earlier so they would soon die, leaving no witnesses. The police and the FBI arrive and Wadsworth is arrested. He breaks free and steals a police car, but his escape is thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat.
