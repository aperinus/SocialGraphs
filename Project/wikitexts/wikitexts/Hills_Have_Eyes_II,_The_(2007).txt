Following the events of the first film, the [[United States Department of Defense]] sent a military army to occupy the location and exterminate the remainder of the mutant clan. Colonel Lincoln Redding and a trio of scientists who are working in that area on installing a [[surveillance]] system are attacked by the mutants.\n\nLater, a group of National Guardsmen in training led by Sergeant Jeffrey \"Sarge\" Millstone are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists. They arrive to find the base camp abandoned after the mutants' attack. When the soldiers pick up a faint distress call, Sarge organizes a search and rescue mission through the hills. Napoleon and Amber, who stay behind at the camp, find and retrieve one of the missing scientists out of the camp's [[portable toilet]], but he dies before he can warn them. The two are then attacked by the mutants, who destroy their transport and steal their weapons, forcing them to run into the hills to warn the others. The search party is attacked by the mutants; Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed by Stabber, and Sarge is accidentally shot dead by Spitter's friendly fire just before Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group. Spitter is killed after one of the mutants sabotages his [[rappelling]] gear as the others try to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen, they are forced to try to find another way to escape.\n\nThe remaining troops soon locate Redding, mortally wounded and unhinged from the mutant's attack. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and reveals an exit route through the mining caves before committing suicide. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon, forcing the other troops to rescue her. Stump leaves the group to escape on his own before being pursued and killed by Letch while attempting to climb down the hill. Separating from Crank and Delmar, Napoleon and Amber cross paths with Chameleon, whom they manage to kill. While escaping Sniffer, they are rescued by a nonviolent mutant named Hansel; Sniffer encounters Crank and Delmar, shoots the latter with one of the group's [[M4 carbine|M4's]] and is killed by Crank in retaliation. While Hansel leads them to the exit, Delmar dies from his wounds after arriving at the mine\u2019s doorway. Napoleon joins Amber to save Missy. Crank, who is attempting to unlock the [[blast door]], dies when accidentally triggering an explosion of a crate of dynamite that he attempts to take with him.\n\nAfter killing Letch, Napoleon and Amber locate Missy who is being savagely raped by Papa Hades. After distracting him, they manage to free her, but Hades soon returns and attacks them, triggering a vicious fight until the trio finally subdues and kills the mutant leader with a bayonet. As the survivors prepare to depart the mines, they are watched by an unknown mutant using their surveillance equipment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael McMillian]] as Private First Class David \"Napoleon\" Napoli\n* [[Jessica Stroup]] as Private First Class Amber \"Barbie\" Johnson\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Private First Class Carlos \"Crank\" Medina\n* [[Daniella Alonso]] as Private First Class Marisol \"Missy\" Martinez\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Sergeant Jeff \"Sarge\" Millstone\n* [[Lee Thompson Young]] as Private First Class Delmar \"Del\" Reed\n* [[Eric Edelstein]] as Corporal Gilbert \"Spitter\" Cole\n* [[Reshad Strik]] as Private First Class Michael \"Mickey\" Elrod\n* Ben Crowley as Private First Class Scott \"Stump\" Locke\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Papa Hades\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Chameleon\n* David Reynolds as Hansel\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as Colonel Lincoln Redding\n* [[Jay Acovone]] as Dr. Wilson\n* Philip Pavel as Dr. Paul Foster\n* [[Archie Kao]] as Dr. Han\n* Jason Oettle as Letch\n* G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Szab\u00f3 as Sniffer\n* Tyrell Kemlo as Stabber\n* [[C\u00e9cile Breccia]] as Pregnant Woman\n* Fatiha Quatili as Afghan Woman\n* Joseph Beddelem as Insurgent\n* Jeremy Goei as Clyde Martinez\n\n==Production==\nAn international co-production film between The United States and Morocco. ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' began filming in the summer of 2006 in [[Ouarzazate]], [[Morocco]], where the [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|previous movie]] was filmed. The alternative title was ''The Hills Have Eyes 2: The Hills Still Have Eyes''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWriter Wes Craven's initial inspiration for the film came during a casual conversation with producer Peter Locke. Craven envisioned that the previous film's character, Brenda ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), traumatized by her suffering during the events of ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', joins the National Guard to overcome her fears. Barely finished with basic training, Brenda receives a call from her sergeant, who explains that they are sending a team back to the New Mexico desert to eradicate the remaining mutants. Her sergeant and the team need her, for she is the only one left alive who knows the mutants' location. Because of de Ravin's involvement in the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', her schedule was unable to accommodate the filming of the sequel. [[Wes Craven]] replaced her character, but retained much of the original concept, including the group of National Guard soldiers in training.<ref name=\"THHE2\">{{cite magazine|last=Carolyn|first=Axelle|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2- Military Fright|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|publisher=The Brooklyn Company, Inc.|location=United States|date=February 2007|asin=B001QL5G42|volume=28|issue=260|issn=0164-2111|oclc=4618144}}</ref>\n\nA one-minute [http://www.foxatomic.com/#PAGE_100:movie=/content/movies/trl_hhe2_v01r01.flv teaser trailer] was released on December 12, 2006.

The 2006 remake ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up \u2014 in which [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout \u2014 is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|first=Matt Zoller|last=Seitz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/24/movies/24eyes.html|title=Forget the Eyes.

Club]]'' wrote in his review: \"The premise for ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'', the quickie follow-up to [[Alexandre Aja]]'s skillful but gratuitous [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|2006 remake of Craven's original]], seems like a perfect opportunity to give the mutants their due, since it deploys a group of military people back to the scene of the crime. And yet it stupidly does the opposite, reducing the mutants to mine-dwelling freaks who murder and rape because, well, that's what they do. After a prologue so repugnant that it's unworthy of description, the film touches down in [[New Mexico]]'s \"Sector 15\", where a handful of military technicians are busy installing a top-secret surveillance system. When a group of National Guard trainees are dispatched to the site to deliver equipment, they're shocked to discover the men either missing or dead, and they start combing the surrounding hills on a search-and-rescue mission. What they don't realize is that the mutants are luring them into various traps designed to kill the men and abduct the women for (ugh) breeding purposes. So it's up to these unseasoned and often downright inept soldiers to fight their way out of trouble. Directed by music-video veteran [[Martin Weisz]]\u2014in the future, can producers please look elsewhere for talent?\u2014''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' assembles the most motley group of incompetents this side of a [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' movie]], yet somehow misses the laughs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/the-hills-have-eyes-2-3538|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2|first=Scott|last=Tobias|work=[[The A.V.
