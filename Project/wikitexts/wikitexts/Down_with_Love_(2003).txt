It is about freeing women from love, enjoying sex without commitment, and replacing the need for a man with things such as chocolate. Barbara believes her rules will help boost women in the workplace and the world in general. When Banner House's male executives reject the book, Vikki Hiller, Barbara's editor, suggests Barbara meet with Catcher Block\u2014a successful writer for ''Know'' magazine and a notorious ladies' man\u2014to help promote the book. However, Catcher repeatedly avoids meeting Barbara until, fed up, she insults him. Catcher's boss and best friend, Peter MacMannus, and Vikki develop a mutual attraction, but neither is brave enough to express their feelings to the other. Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher's strong personality, and Vikki wants to see strength in her lover, even assuming Peter must be [[Homosexuality|gay]].\n\nBarbara and Vikki persuade [[Judy Garland]] to sing \"[[Down with Love (song)|Down with Love]]\" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' to promote the book. Sales skyrocket, as women around the world rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara but ''she'' rejects ''him''. The breaking point comes as Barbara appears on a national TV show and discusses a chapter from her book\u2014\"The Worst Kind of Man\"\u2014and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example, causing the women he dates to reject him.\n\nCatcher schemes to prove Barbara really wants love and marriage like every other women. He poses as Major Zip Martin, a polite and attentive astronaut. Barbara is immediately infatuated with a man who seems unaware of her celebrity, in contrast to the men who now avoid her since her book was published. As \"Zip\" takes her to fashionable New York locations, he maintains sexual tension by feigning naivete and a desire to remain chaste until he is \"ready\" for a physical relationship. His plan becomes complicated after he starts falling for her.\n\nWhen Barbara encounters Catcher/Zip at a party, which nearly exposes his true identity, he decides to take everything to the next level. He tells Barbara Catcher Block wants to interview him for an expos\u00e9 on the [[NASA]] space program and asks her to be there. At his apartment, he sets everything up to record her saying she loves him. Unfortunately, as they are about to have sex, one of his lovers, Gwendolyn, walks in. Not knowing who Barbara is, she exposes Catcher's identity, forcing him to confess to Barbara. Barbara then reveals she is actually Nancy Brown, one of Catcher's many former secretaries. She fell in love with him whilst working at ''Know''. She had turned down a date with him, refusing to be another fling. She wanted to be different from the other women he knew, and make him fall in love with her. Catcher proclaims he wants to marry her, but Gwendolyn, having overheard Barbara Novak's name, thanks her for what she has done for womankind. Barbara realizes she does not want love or Catcher, as she has become a real \"down with love\" girl. Vikki and Peter's relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher. Peter realizes he is indeed like any other man, and takes Vikki to Catcher's apartment to have passionate sex with her.\n\nDays later, Catcher is completely depressed and has failed to win back Barbara. Even his expos\u00e9, which he wrote on how falling in love with her made him a better man, is ruined now Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, ''Now''. Catcher goes to ''Now'' on the pretense of a job interview. He tells Barbara how much she has changed him and wishes there could be a middle ground for them, somewhere between her confident blonde persona and her original brunette self. After he leaves her office, she surprises him on the elevator, showing him a bright red hair style. she has found the middle ground and wants to be with him. They elope to Las Vegas, inspiring Vikki and Peter to also get married.\n\nThe end credits show Barbara and Catcher's marriage has resulted in a new book aimed at ending the battle of the sexes. The pair sing \"Here's to Love\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Barbara Novak\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Catcher Block\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Vikki Hiller\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Peter MacMannus\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Gladys\n* [[Jack Plotnick]] as Maurice\n* [[Tony Randall]] as Theodore Banner\n* [[John Aylward]] as E.G.\n* [[Warren Munson]] as C.B.\n* [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as J.B.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as J.R.\n* [[Timothy Omundson]] as R.J.\n* [[Jeri Ryan]] as Gwendolyn\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Yvette\n* [[Melissa George]] as Elkie\n* [[Dorie Barton]] as Sally\n* [[Chris Parnell]] as TV Emcee\n}}\n\n==Style==\nThe sets, [[costume]]s, [[cinematography]], [[film editing|editing]], [[film score|score]], opening credits, and [[visual effects]] (including [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split-screen]] shots during phone calls heavily laced with [[double entendres]] between the two leads), are carefully designed to echo the style of 1960s comedies. The [[New York City]] skyline of 1962 was digitally recreated for backdrops. A [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] technique was used to simulate unconvincing 1960s [[rear projection]] using restored street footage from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The film begins with the 1960s logos for [[20th Century Fox]] and for [[CinemaScope]], a wide-screen process introduced in the 1950s, developed and owned by 20th Century Fox, with the 1998 version of the fanfare, composed by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]].

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] spoke of the film fairly positively, saying parts were \"fun\" and describing Zellweger's speech at the end as \"a torrent of words [pouring] out from her character's innermost soul\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/down-with-love-2003 |title=Down with Love Movie Review & Film Summary |publisher=Roger Ebert |access-date=July 3, 2017}}</ref> [[A. O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised director \"Reed's buoyant homage,\" Zellweger's Doris Day-like ability to \"swivel engagingly between goofiness and sex appeal\", McGregor's Sinatra-like \"wiry, wolfish energy\" and screenwriters Ahlert's and Drake's \"canny cocktail of period vernacular and deliberately labored double entendres\", finding the movie \"intelligent and amusing\" with \"a glorious, hectic artificiality\". But he questioned \"the point of the exercise\" compared to [[Todd Haynes]]' ''[[Far from Heaven]]'', which \"plunged into the subtext of those old movies\", whereas ''Down with Love'', being an \"updating and a critique\", \"snips that subtext away\", making it \"less sophisticated than what it imitates\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/>\n\nConversely, ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'s}} [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote \"''Down With Love'' is superior to ''Far From Heaven''\", which \"seems naive in comparison\" because \"''Down with Love'' is a very smart, very shrewd movie, and the smartest, shrewdest thing about it is the way it masquerades as just a fluffy comedy, a diversion, a trifle. Hardly a trifle, ''Down With Love'' distills 40 years of sexual politics into 100 minutes, using the romantic-comedy conventions of an earlier time to comment on the governing social assumptions of yesterday\u2014and today, as well... The brilliance of ''Down With Love'' is that it slyly reminds us that our modern perspective, like every 'modern perspective' that preceded it, is doomed to obsolescence and isn't some final stage of enlightened social thought.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |title=Up with 'Down' / Behind retro-fluff look is a smart view of sex, American style |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=May 16, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Up-with-Down-Behind-retro-fluff-look-is-a-2647963.php |authorlink=Mick LaSalle}}</ref>\n\nOpposing opinions even occurred at the same newspaper, as was the case with ''[[The New York Observer]]'', where [[Rex Reed]]'s review was headlined \"Down With Down With Love!\"<ref>Reed, Rex \"Down With Down With Love!\" ''The New York Observer'' May 19, 2003</ref> but [[Andrew Sarris]]'s headline countered with \"It's Affectionate and Smart, And I'm Down With Love\".<ref>Sarris, Andrew ''It's Affectionate and Smart, And I'm Down With Love'' The New York Observer May 26, 2003 Archived: [http://observer.com/2003/05/its-affectionate-and-smart-and-im-down-with-love/]</ref>\n\n[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' admired Orlandi's costumes and Laws' design for their \"giddily precise exaggeration\" and wrote that the script \"has a gentle heart to humanize its sharp sitcom wit,\" advising his readers to \"stay for the movie's denouement: a two-minute speech that wraps up the plot like Christmas ribbons around a time bomb\". But he found the film to be \"miscast at the top\" and \"conflicted about its subject\u2014it both derides and adores what it means to parody\" and that director \"Reed often uses a gong where chimes would do.\" Corliss concludes: \"As you see, we too are conflicted about this film. We want to love it, but like a Rock Hudson rake, we keep finding fault in its allure. We want to hate it, but like Doris Day, we finally can't say no\".<ref name=\"TimeMay11\"/>\n\n[[Nathan Rabin]] wrote that Chicago critics by and large embraced ''Down With Love'', noting: \"It got two thumbs up from [[Ebert & Roeper]] and was No. 2 on the Top 10 list of [[Chicago Reader]] critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]],<ref>Rabin, Nathan ''Ribald Retro Case File #146: 'Down With Love' My Year Of Flops'' The A.V.
