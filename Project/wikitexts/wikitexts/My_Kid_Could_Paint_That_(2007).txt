The movie follows the early artistic career of [[Marla Olmstead]], a young girl from [[Binghamton]], [[New York (state)|New York]] who gains fame first as a [[child prodigy]] painter of abstract art, and then becomes the subject of controversy concerning whether she truly completed the paintings herself or did so with her parents' assistance and/or direction. The film was bought by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in 2007 after premiering at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].\n\n==Taglines==\n* \"Inspiration or Manipulation? You Decide.\"\n* \"American dream or art world scheme?\"\n\n==Summary==\nMarla's father, an amateur painter, describes how Marla watches him paint, wants to help, and is given her own canvas and supplies. A friend asks to hang Marla's pictures in his coffee shop and is surprised when people ask to buy them. A local newspaper reporter, Elizabeth Cohen, writes a piece about Marla, after first asking her parents if they really want her to do so. Cohen's story is picked up by ''[[The New York Times]]'', and Marla becomes a media celebrity, with appearances on television and shows at galleries in New York and Los Angeles. Sales of her work earn over $300,000.\n\nThe tone of the documentary turns with a scene of Marla's parents watching a February 2005 report by [[CBS News]]' ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' that questions whether Marla painted the works attributed to her. ''60 Minutes'' enlisted the help of [[Ellen Winner]], a child [[psychologist]] who studies cognition in the arts and gifted children. Seeing video images of some of the paintings attributed to Marla, Winner initially reacts positively, stating: \"It's absolutely beautiful. You could slip it into the Museum of Modern Art and absolutely get away with it.\" The ''60 Minutes'' reporter, [[Charlie Rose]], then shows Winner what he describes as \"50 minutes of videotape shot by us and by Marla's parents.\" After seeing this footage, Winner states: \"This is eye-opening to me, to see her actually painting.\" Rose asks her how this is \"eye-opening.\" Winner responds: \"Because she's not doing anything that a normal child wouldn't do. She's just kind of slowly pushing the paint around.\"\n\nRose then states that after \"our interview,\" the Olmsteads agreed to permit CBS crews to set up a hidden camera in their home to tape their daughter painting a single piece in five hours over the course of a month.  When Winner reviewed the tapes, the psychologist said, \"I saw no evidence that she was a child prodigy in painting. I saw a normal, charming, adorable child painting the way preschool children paint, except that she had a coach that kept her going.\" Winner also indicated that the painting created before CBS's hidden camera looked \"less polished than some of Marla's previous works.\" Asked to explain the difference, Winner states: \"I can only speculate. I don't see Marla as having made, or at least completed, the more polished looking paintings, because they look like a different painter. Either somebody else painted them start to finish, or somebody else doctored them up. Or, Marla just miraculously paints in a completely different way than we see on her home video.\"<ref name=60Minutes>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/22/60II/main675522.shtml New Questions About Child Prodigy] from ''[[60 Minutes II]]''</ref>\n\nMarla's parents film her creating a second work, ''Ocean,'' but Bar-Lev is not fully convinced.  A couple are shown considering the purchase of ''Ocean.'' The woman complains that ''Ocean'' does not look like the other works by Marla. They buy it anyway.  In a slide show, Bar-Lev compares ''Ocean'' with the ''60 Minutes'' piece and then with several other works attributed to Marla. Viewers are left to make their own judgments.\n\nThe film also raises questions about the nature of art, especially [[abstract expressionism]], the nature of the documentary process, and the perception that the media imparts fame to subjects only to later subject them to intense scrutiny and criticism.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his October 2007 review of Bar-Lev's film, [[Roger Ebert]] stated: \"My own verdict as an outsider is, no, Marla didn't paint those works, although she may have applied some of the paint. In the last analysis, I guess it all reduces to taste and instinct. Some paintings are good, says me, or says you, and some are bad. Some paintings could be painted by a child, some couldn't be.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/REVIEWS/710180306 Roger Ebert's review of the film at rogerebert.suntimes.com]</ref>\n\nIn his review of Bar-Lev's film, ''[[LA Weekly]]'''s art critic Doug Harvey reveals a different viewpoint. \"The works created by Marla on camera are different from some of her canvasses, similar to others and better than many. Bar-Lev\u2019s big reveal is a bust, and turns what could have been a compelling inquiry into the machinations of the art market and media into a tawdry embarrassment. Apart from the questionable ethics, it\u2019s lousy art. In the final analysis, the filmmaker\u2019s crisis of faith is unconvincing, except as one of a series of blatantly manipulative decisions that, despite the lack of any kind of empirical evidence, bolsters the most commercially viable story that can be milked from the situation \u2014 the one where Marla\u2019s parents are supernaturally cunning con artists out to exploit the gullibility of the deluded collectors of essentially fraudulent modern art.\"<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/art+books/art/marla-vs-pollock-whos-the-fraudiest/17432/ Dough Harvey's review of the film] at ''[[LA Weekly]]''.com</ref>\n\nAs of May 2021, the film holds a 94% \"Fresh\" rating at the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 83 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=My Kid Could Paint That (2007)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_kid_could_paint_that|language=en|access-date=2021-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Post-release events==\nAs of October 2007, the Olmstead's website<ref>[http://www.marlaolmstead.com MarlaOlmstead.com]</ref> displays videos of Marla working on three more canvases, ''Fairy Map'', ''Rabbit'', and ''Colorful Rain''.<ref>[http://www.marlaolmstead.com/videos-Feb2007.html Videos of Marla Olmstead painting]</ref> The videos employ the jump-cut technique, meaning that the scene (a shot of the canvas on which Marla paints) is generally continuous, but that the action stops and then starts again with the subject (Marla) having shifted position relative to the video frame. As of August 2008, the website depicts 49 canvases it says have been sold and 16 more available for sale, including two of the three works featured in the videos, ''Rabbit'', and ''Colorful Rain''. In a 2015 interview, Marla, then a high school sophomore, said she hasn't seen the movie and doesn't remember the events. She  still paints but has other interests as well.<ref>[https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2015/12/27/catching-up-child-art-prodigy-marla-olmstead/77668896/ Catching up with child art prodigy Marla Olmstead]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[F for Fake]]'', a 1974 [[Orson Welles]] documentary which also raised questions about who gets to decide what is and is not art.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sonyclassics.com/mykidcouldpaintthat/ Movie official website]\n*{{IMDb title|0912592}}\n* {{Amg movie|381466|My Kid Could Paint That}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=my_kid_could_paint_that|title=My Kid Could Paint That}}\n*[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/fall2007/my_kid_paint.php interview with ''My Kid Could Paint That'' director Amir Bar-Lev] at [[Filmmaker Magazine]]\n*[http://www.ioncinema.com/news.php?nid=2216 IONCINEMA.com interview with Amir Bar-Lev]\n*[http://www.marlaolmstead.com Marla Olmstead's website]\n*[http://www.marlaolmstead.com/videos-Feb2007.html Videos of Marla Olmstead painting]\n*[http://www.titicut.com/documentary-reviews/my-kid-could-paint-that/ Academic review of ''My Kid Could Paint That'']\n\n{{60 Minutes}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:British documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about children]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the media]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about painters]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:2007 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Amir Bar-Lev]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
