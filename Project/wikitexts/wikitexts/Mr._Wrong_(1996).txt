It was a critical failure and [[box office bomb]]. DeGeneres used to mention it occasionally in her talk show, ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', poking fun at the disastrous reception of her major film debut. As of 2022, it remains her first and last film as lead actor in a live action film.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe film begins with Martha Alston (DeGeneres) in a wedding gown [[Incarceration|incarcerated]] in a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[prison]]. The investigators call her Mrs. Crawford and listen to her explain why she committed [[murder]] on her [[Wedding|wedding day]].\n\nSome months earlier, Martha attends her younger sister's wedding. Afterwards, Martha is pestered by her overbearing parents about when she will get married herself being 31 years old with her biological clock ticking. Martha works as an associate producer for a local TV talk show in San Diego. She rejects an offer of going out on a date with a younger co-worker, named Walter (John Livingston). Disappointed by her dull [[Valentine's Day]] [[wikt:blind date|blind date]], she goes home to [[wikt:sulk|sulk]] in front of the TV, where, inundated by romantic imagery, she is prompted to get out of the house.\n\nMartha goes to a bar where she drops her [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] in front of the [[jukebox]]. She bends down to get it when a man shows up and selects the same song she would have chosen. He is Whitman Crawford (Pullman), and they instantly hit it off. They go back to his house and have sex. He says he's a [[poet]] and an [[investor]], and has money. He reads her one of his poems.\n\nWhitman appears charming and charismatic in which he and Martha begin dating. Martha introduces Whitman to her family and he impresses all of them. But by the time she meets his strange and eccentric mother (Plowright), Martha has become convinced he is not \"Mr. Right\" at all. After Martha tells Whitman that it is OK to \"be himself\" around her, he suddenly breaks character and shoplifts a six-pack of beer from a local store and enjoys crushing the empty beer cans on his forehead. It is here that Whitman is revealed to be a crafty, devious, narcissistic sociopath who hides behind a charming nice-guy persona that fools literally everyone he comes into contact with. To make matters worse, Whitman's ex-girlfriend, Inga ([[Joan Cusack]]) (who is nearly as crazy and deranged as Whitman), and her [[accomplice]], Bob ([[Brad William Henke]]), begin [[Harassment|harassing]] Martha who decides to break up with Whitman. Inga refuses to believe that Martha has dumped Whitman. Whitman also refuses to believe he has been dumped and he begins [[stalking]] Martha and trying to woo her back in increasingly ridiculous ways. Martha soon becomes frustrated and desperate after the manipulative Whitman tells her whole smitten and oblivious family that they are engaged to be married. He even buys off the private investigator ([[Dean Stockwell]]) whom Martha hires to run a background check on him. All of Martha's attempts to expose Whitman as the dangerous sociopath that he is to her friends and family is met with skepticism or disbelief from everyone due to Whitman's skill at lying and manipulation. Whitman goes as far as to make Martha lose her job, and then hits her with his pickup truck, drugs her and abducts her, taking her to [[Mexico]] to marry her there by hiring two young Mexican children to hold her captive as they travel on the road to their destination.\n\nOnce in Mexico, Martha attempts to escape and manages to place a phone call to San Diego to her former office to the only person that has not fallen under Whitman's influence: her co-worker Walter whom she manages to hurriedly explain that Whitman has abducted her and to travel to Mexico and rescue her. Whitman then catches up to her and disconnects the call. Inga and Bob appear and attempt to kill Martha, but Whitman comes to Martha's rescue and manages to drive them away at gunpoint.\n\nAt the church where Whitman is forcing Martha to get married in front of her deluded family, Walter shows up at the last minute to rescue Martha from the wedding, but trips. His gun falls into her hands and she shoots Whitman who attempts to lunge at her. Then she's arrested, which leads to Martha telling the local authorities her entire story. However, even the Mexican investigators are unsympathetic and conclude that she murdered Whitman intentionally. As they are transporting her away, Walter springs her out of jail with Bob's help and explains that it was Inga who did it; she attempted to shoot Martha from the church balcony, but when Martha tripped, Inga hit Whitman by accident. Walter claims that Whitman is still alive at a local hospital and he will recover from his wound.\n\nAfter meeting up with Bob in the desert, Martha and Walter ride a horse west towards the sunset, while Bob leaves to return to Inga. Title cards over the closing scene explain that Martha and Walter eventually turned north and returned to the USA where they got romantically involved and currently live under assumed names, Inga and Bob got married and opened a pet store in [[Albuquerque]], and Whitman continues his search for love.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Martha Alston\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Whitman Crawford\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Inga Gunther\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Jack Tramonte\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Mrs. Crawford\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Annie Alston\n* [[Ellen Cleghorne]] as Jane\n* [[Robert Goulet]] as Dick Braxton\n* John Livingston as Walter\n* [[Peter White (actor)|Peter White]] as Mr. Alston\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Mrs. Alston\n* [[Camille Saviola]] as Consuela\n* Briant Wells as Stuart\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Bob (as Brad Henke)\n* Christine Cattell as Nancy Culpepper\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Missy\n* Jonathan Hernandez as Self\n* Victoria Elena Flores as Nicole (as Victoria Flores)\n* [[Louie Anderson]] as Himself\n* [[Casey Kasem]] as Himself\n* [[Jean Kasem]] as Herself\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn January 1995, it was announced Ellen Degeneres would star in Mr. Wrong for a reported $2.2 million.<ref name=\"Casting\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1995/more/news/degeneres-deal-99125315/|title=     Degeneres Deal     |publisher=Variety|access-date=July 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was critically panned, garnering a score of 6% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 31 critics.
