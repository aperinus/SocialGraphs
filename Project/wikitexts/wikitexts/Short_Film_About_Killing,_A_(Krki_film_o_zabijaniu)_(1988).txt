Written by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski and [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]], the film was expanded from ''[[Dekalog: Five]]'' of the Polish television series ''[[Dekalog]]''. Set in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], the film compares the senseless, violent murder of an individual to the cold, calculated execution by the state.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|title=A Short Film About Killing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095468/ |access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref> ''A Short Film About Killing'' won both the [[Jury Prize]] and the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"cannes\">{{cite web|title=A Short Film About Killing |publisher=Festival de Cannes |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/329/year/1988.html |access-date=10 February 2012}}</ref> as well as the [[European Film Award]] for Best Film.<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for A Short Film About Killing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095468/awards |access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWaldemar Rekowski (Jan Tesarz) is a middle-aged [[taxicab]] driver in [[Warsaw]]. An overweight and crude man, he enjoys staring at young women. Jacek \u0141azar ([[Miros\u0142aw Baka]]) is a 21-year-old [[Vagabond (person)|drifter]] who recently arrived in Warsaw from the countryside and is now aimlessly wandering the streets of the city. He seems to take pleasure in causing other people's misfortunes: he throws a stranger into the urinals of a public toilet after being approached sexually; he drops a large stone from a bridge onto a passing vehicle causing an accident; and he scares away pigeons to spite an old lady who was feeding them. Piotr Balicki ([[Krzysztof Globisz]]) is a young and idealistic lawyer who has just passed the bar exam. He takes his wife to a caf\u00e9 where they discuss their future. At the same caf\u00e9, Jacek is sitting at a table handling a length of rope and a stick which he keeps in his bag. He puts away the rope and stick when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window and he engages in a game with them. Jacek is later revealed to have been deeply traumatised by the death of his sister.\n\nMeanwhile, Waldemar has been driving his taxicab around the city looking for a fare. He stops near the caf\u00e9 just as Jacek approaches and enters the cab. He asks to be driven to a remote part of the city near the countryside and insists the driver take a longer and more remote route. At their destination, Jacek murders Waldemar, by strangling him with the rope and then hitting him repeatedly with a large rock.\n\nSome time later, Jacek is caught and imprisoned. He is interviewed by his [[criminal defense lawyer]], Piotr, for whom this is his first case after finishing his legal studies. Piotr has little chance of winning the case against Jacek because of the strong [[evidence (law)|evidence]] against his client.  In spite of Piotr's efforts, Jacek is found guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. Piotr approaches a judge afterwards asking if he could have done more to save his client's life. The judge says that Piotr gave the best argument against the death penalty he has heard in years, but that the legal outcome is correct.\n\nOn the appointed day, the [[executioner]] arrives at the jail and prepares for the hanging. Piotr is at the prison to attend the execution, and an official congratulates him on having just become a father. In the moments before his execution, Jacek reveals to Piotr that his younger sister was killed by a [[tractor]] driven by his drunken friend, and that he was drinking with him; he says he never fully recovered from the tragic episode. Jacek then requests that he be given the final space in his family's grave which was reserved for his mother\u2014that he be buried next to his sister and his father. The warden repeatedly asks if they are finished talking; Piotr defiantly says he will never be finished. Jacek makes some petty last requests to his lawyer. They conclude that things would have turned out differently if the girl had not tragically died.\n\nJacek is then taken from his cell and marched to the execution chamber by several prison guards. The confirmation of his sentence is read to him, as well as the decision to deny clemency. He is given last rites by a priest, and offered a final cigarette by the warden. When he requests to have one without filter instead, the executioner steps forward, lights one of his cigarettes and puts it into Jacek's mouth. Jacek takes a few puffs before it is stubbed out. Just before he is hanged, he breaks free from his guards and begins to yell uncontrollably before his hands are shackled and he is hanged. Afterwards, Piotr drives to an empty field where he sobs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miros\u0142aw Baka]] as Jacek Lazar\n* [[Krzysztof Globisz]] as Piotr Balicki (Advocate)\n* Jan Tesarz as Waldemar Rekowski (Taxi driver)\n* [[Zbigniew Zapasiewicz]] as Committee Chairman\n* Barbara Dziekan as Cashier\n* Aleksander Bednarz as The Executioner\n* Jerzy Zass as Police Commander\n* Zdzis\u0142aw Tobiasz as Judge\n* [[Artur Barci\u015b]] as Young Man\n* [[Krystyna Janda]] as Dorota\n* [[Olgierd \u0141ukaszewicz]] as Andrzej\n* Peter Falchi as British Motorist\n* Elzbieta Helman as Beatka\n* W\u0142adys\u0142aw Byrdy as a helper of Executioner \n* [[Maciej Maciejewski]] as Prosecutor<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for A Short Film About Killing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095468/fullcredits#cast |access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n''A Short Film About Killing'' was released in the same year that the death penalty was suspended in Poland. In 1988 the country carried out just a single execution, with 6 condemned prisoners being hanged in 1987. The portrayal of the execution method and procedure is mostly accurate, though, in reality, the date of executions were a surprise to the prisoner; the condemned man would simply be led into a room to discover it was the execution chamber. After the early years of Communist repression, executions were quite rare and invariably for murder; from 1969 a total of 183 men were hanged and no women.\n\n==Themes==\n;Social class\nIn her article about the film, Janina Falkowska describes the brutality of the effects [[Social class|class societies]] have on the lower class, emphasizing on the \"hopelessness\" of the latter and false hope of the former.<ref name=\"Falkowska\">Falkowska, J. (Winter 1995). \"'The Political' in the Films of Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski\" in ''Cinema Journal''. 34 (2), pp. 37-50.</ref>\n\n;Law and politics\nFalkowska also talks about the [[Justice system|law]] as a personified entity\u2014capable of being both just and unjust, responsible for saving and ruining lives. Its integrity is thus significant to the fate of the protagonist.<ref name=\"Falkowska\" />\n\n;Death and mutiny\n\nCine-literacy author Charles V. Eidsvik suggests there is a \"presence of senseless malice in the film\", a notion reiterated in the forms of death and mutiny.<ref>Eidsvik, Charles (Fall 1990) \"Kieslowski's Short Films\" in ''Film Quarterly''. Found here: http://www.petey.com/kk/docs/shorts1.txt</ref>\n\n==Style==\nThe film shows a very bleak Poland near the end of the Communist era. This is greatly enhanced by the strong use of colour filters to distort the images of Warsaw, creating a raw, unattractive image. The print appears to have an effect similar to [[sepia tone]] or [[bleach bypass]]\u2014although it is a colour picture, the photography combined with grey locations provides an effect similar to monochrome.\n\nKie\u015blowski credits his cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, for this deliberate visual unattractiveness within the film, stating: \"I sense that the world is becoming more and more ugly. . . . I wanted to dirty this world. . . . We used green filters that give this strange effect, allowing us to mask all that isn\u2019t essential to the image\".<ref>Haltof, Marek (2004) the cinema of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski: variations on destiny and chance (London: Wallflower Press). Pp. 92-93</ref>  When Kieslowski first showed Idziak the screenplay, he commented, saying, \"I can\u2019t even read this! It disgusts me,\" and then finally conceded, \"I\u2019ll shoot it only on the condition that you let me do it green and use all my filters, with which I\u2019ll darken the image.\" Kieslowski was not pleased, but he accepted the ultimatum, telling Idziak, \"if you want to make green shit, it\u2019s your affair.\" The cinematographer concluded, \"That\u2019s how the graphic concept came about which Cahiers Du Cinema wrote that it was the most originally shot movie in the Cannes Film Festival.\"<ref>Insdorf, Annette (1999). ''Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski''. New York: Hyperion, p. 95.</ref> Idziak also used a hand held camera when filming; this gave an added raw feel to the film as it follows the daily routines of the film's protagonist.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming locations===\nThe film was shot on location in [[Warsaw]] and [[Siedlce]]. Like the gloomy events portrayed in the film, the capital city of [[Warsaw]] is depicted as a repellent, depressing place: grey, brutal and peopled by alienated characters. Several areas of the city were used:<ref name=\"Haltof, Marek 2004\">Haltof, Marek (2004) the cinema of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski: variations on destiny and chance (London: Wallflower Press)</ref>\n\n* [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]], Sr\u00f3dmiescie, Warsaw, Mazowieckie, Poland\n* Old Town, [[\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Warsaw]], Mazowieckie, Poland\n* [[Siedlce]], Mazowieckie, Poland\n* [[Warsaw]], Mazowieckie, Poland<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Filming locations for A Short Film About Killing |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095468/locations |access-date=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe Polish premiere coincided with a heated debate in Poland about capital punishment. Although the film's [[diegesis]] does not directly address political events, it is unanimously interpreted as a political statement. The Polish audience did not like the parallel alluded to between a murder committed by an individual and a murder committed by the state. Despite this controversy, the majority of critics praised Kieslowski's film and it was nominated for and won a multitude of awards.<ref>Falkowska, J. (winter, 1995). \"The Political in the Films of Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski.

In 2012, [[Cyrus Frisch]] voted for ''A Short Film About Killing''.

Kieslowski himself selected ''[[Dekalog: Five]]'', leaving the second for the Polish ministry of culture. The Ministry selected ''[[Dekalog: Six]]'' and funded both productions.<ref name=\"Haltof, Marek 2004\"/>\n\nThe cinematic release of ''[[Dekalog: Five]]'': A Short film about killing, premiered in Polish cinemas in March 1988.\n\nAlthough the main plot in both works is the same, ''Dekalog: Five'' has a different order in editing and makes more use of [[voice-over]], whereas the film starts differently and gives a more prominent role to Piotr, the lawyer. ''Dekalog: Five'' suddenly jumps from the killing scene to jail and there is no connection or explanation on how Jacek got arrested. A few scenes and lines of dialogue do not feature in ''Dekalog: Five'', to keep it within the time limitations for TV as intended.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Capital punishment in Poland]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0095468|A Short Film About Killing}}\n\n{{Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski}}\n{{Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize}}\n{{European Film Award for Best Film}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Short Film About Killing, A}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Polish crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s Polish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:European Film Awards winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Poland]]\n[[Category:Films set in Warsaw]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Zbigniew Preisner]]\n[[Category:Capital punishment in Poland]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Piesiewicz]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]"}]}}}}
