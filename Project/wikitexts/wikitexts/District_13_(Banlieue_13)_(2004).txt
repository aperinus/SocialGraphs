Especially [[Banlieue]] 13, commonly referred to as B13: a [[ghetto]] with a population of two million people. Unable to control B13, the authorities surround the entire area with a high wall topped by [[barbed tape]], forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. Le\u00efto is a fighter of such gangs. He disposes of a case of drugs down a drain, then escapes the gang led by K2, an enforcer who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, a ruthless man named Taha Ben Mahmoud is angered and executes three of K2's men until K2 suggests they kidnap Le\u00efto's sister Lola in retaliation. Lola is captured by K2 at a supermarket. Le\u00efto is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police chief in charge betrays and arrests Le\u00efto, saying they are leaving the district and are not willing to stand up to the gangs. Taha leaves with Lola. Despite the chief saying sorry, Leito is angered by the excuses and kills the chief out of frustration by breaking his neck.\n\nSix months later, undercover policeman Damien Tomaso completes a successful operation at an underground casino in Paris, single handedly taking down or gunning down the casino's guards and arresting the pit boss. His next assignment is briefed by Kruger, a government official. Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Posing as a prisoner, Damien infiltrates the district to disarm the bomb. Le\u00efto immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save Le\u00efto's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses. After Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds. Le\u00efto and Damien escape. K2 and his men soon realize that with Taha unable to pay them, they are free from his grasp. Taha attempts to command K2 as a last resort, but K2, fed up with Taha's brutality, turns his back on his former boss and allows his men to gun down Taha. K2 takes over the gang and goes to find Leito and Damien.\n\nAfter a footchase K2 catches up with Leito and Damien but calls a truce and allows Leito and Damien to disarm the bomb. Leito and Damien reach the bomb but are forced to fight a large man named Yeti who was planted by Taha to guard the bomb. After they defeat Yeti, Damien calls Kruger to receive the deactivation code. After hearing Kruger ask if the \"bomb is in the exact spot\" and recognizing \"B13\" in the code's last characters, Le\u00efto deduces that the government has framed them, and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it. Damien refuses to believe that the government has set him up and he fights Leito as Damien truly believes that he is doing the right thing to disarm the bomb, but Lola is able to restrain Damien long enough for the timer on the bomb to run out. The bomb does not explode, proving Le\u00efto right. K2 and his gang allow Leito and Damien to leave the district. The pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force Kruger to admit that he had planned to blow up B13 as a means to end its existence, catching it on camera and broadcasting nationally. Soon the rest of the government promises to tear down the containment wall and bring back schools and police to B13. Le\u00efto and Damien depart as friends, and Lola kisses Damien, encouraging him to visit B13.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Belle]] as Le\u00efto\n* [[Cyril Raffaelli]] as Damien Tomaso\n* [[Tony D'Amario]] as K2\n* [[Dany Verissimo]] as Lola\n* {{ill|Larbi Naceri|fr|Larbi Naceri}} as Taha Ben Mahmoud (sometimes credited as Bibi Naceri)\n* {{ill|Fran\u00e7ois Chattot|fr|Fran\u00e7ois Chattot}} as Kr\u00fcger\n* Nicolas Woirion as Corsini\n* {{ill|Patrick Olivier|fr|Patrick Olivier}} as The Colonel\n* [[Samir Guesmi]] as Jamel\n* [[Jeff Rudom]] as Yeti\n* [[Lyes Salem]] as Samy\n\n== Reception ==\n''District 13'' received mostly positive reviews outside [[France]].
