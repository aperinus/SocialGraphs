The film was written and directed by [[Jaume Balaguer\u00f3]] and [[Paco Plaza]], both of whom returned from the previous film. The story takes place immediately after the events of the first film<ref>{{cite web|title=Update: Behind-the-Scenes of ''Rec 2''|work=ComingSoon|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/pb_article_type/712539-update-behind-the-scenes-of-rec-2|date=8 February 2009|access-date=31 December 2021}}</ref> and follows a team of soldiers assigned to protect a scientist supposedly sent to investigate the cause of the outbreak, but who may already know more about it than he claims.\n\nSeveral actors from the first film reprise their roles, mostly briefly appearing as infected versions of their characters. The film was followed by ''[[Rec 3: Genesis]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Owen ([[Jonathan D. Mellor|Jonathan Mellor]]), an official from the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health]], and a heavily armed [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] team of four (Fernandez, Martos, Rosso and Larra) equipped with video cameras are sent into a quarantined apartment building to find out what happened to its inhabitants, who have been rendered infectious and violent by a contagious virus. Ascending to the attic (where the first film ended) and finding it unoccupied, they return downstairs to investigate a disturbance and are attacked by infected residents.\n\nDuring the investigation, Martos is infected while encountering some of the possessed residents. Owen then uses religious mantra and a [[rosary]] to hold him off in a room. He reveals that he is actually a priest sent by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], the root of the infection. The GEO operators search the apartment where Medeiros was held and find the body of Father Albelda, the original priest charged with the case of Medeiros's possession. They then find a sample of Medeiros's blood taken by Albelda, but lose it to Fernandez's improper handling. Owen tells them that the only way to accomplish the mission now is to get a blood sample from Tristana herself. They are attacked by a group of infected, and Larra, separated from the others and cornered into a room, commits suicide.\n\nThe father of Jennifer persuades a firefighter to help him enter the building through the sewers. They are unknowingly followed by three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori, and the police seal their exit. Jennifer's father is bitten and infected and killed by Owen and the GEO team, while the firefighter is attacked by Martos and killed accidentally by Mire, who kills Martos right after. After Tito is infected, Owen, Fernandez and Rosso find the group. They lock Mire and Ori in a room and encounter reporter \u00c1ngela Vidal ([[Manuela Velasco]]) shocked but safe. The group questions the possessed Tito and deduce from his cryptic answers that Medeiros is in the penthouse and that certain areas are only accessible in total darkness aside from [[infrared]] light.\n\nThe group finds a hidden door using the night vision on \u00c1ngela's camera. They are attacked by Medeiros, who kills Fernandez, and attacks Owen before \u00c1ngela blows her head off with a shotgun. Owen is enraged because he needed the blood sample, but the unnerved \u00c1ngela can only think to leave the building. When Owen refuses to authorize their exit, \u00c1ngela attacks him and kills Rosso when he attempts an intervention. It is revealed that the demon possessing Tristana has now possessed \u00c1ngela. \u00c1ngela kills Owen and imitates his voice to contact the authorities. She tells them that the mission has been accomplished, that Owen must stay inside due to being infected, and that the only survivor allowed to leave is \u00c1ngela. A flashback then reveals what happened right before the story's beginning: \u00c1ngela was captured by Medeiros and had a [[vermiform]] organism orally transmitted into her. As the response team arrived, \u00c1ngela went into hiding.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jonathan D.
