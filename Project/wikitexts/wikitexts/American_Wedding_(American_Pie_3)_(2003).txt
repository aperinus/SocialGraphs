It is the sequel to ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999) and ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001), and the third and intended final installment of the [[American Pie (film series)#Theatrical films|''American Pie'' theatrical series]]. This was to be the last film in the franchise, ending it as a [[trilogy]]; however, a third theatrical sequel, ''[[American Reunion]]'', was released nine years later, while the franchise expanded into a series of [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] standalone sequels, under the umbrella title ''[[American Pie Presents (film series)|American Pie Presents]]'', that began with the release of ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp|Band Camp]]'' (2005).\n\nThe film's main plot focuses on the wedding ceremony of Jim Levenstein ([[Jason Biggs]]) and Michelle Flaherty ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), while its subplot centers on Steve Stifler ([[Seann William Scott]]), and his outrageous antics including his attempt to organize a bachelor party, teaching Jim to dance for the wedding, and competing with Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) to win the heart of Michelle's sister, Cadence ([[January Jones]]).\n\nIt is the last film in the series to be written by Herz, who conceptualized the franchise, and also the only theatrical film in the series in which [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] (Oz), [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] (Sherman), [[Mena Suvari]] (Heather), [[Tara Reid]] (Vicky), [[Shannon Elizabeth]] (Nadia) and [[Natasha Lyonne]] (Jessica) do not appear.\n\n==Plot==\nJim Levenstein prepares to propose to Michelle at a restaurant when his dad calls to tell him he has the ring. She misinterprets when Jim stalls the question and his dad arrives as he is receiving [[fellatio]] from under the table. The mishap grasps everyone's attention but Jim still proposes and Michelle accepts.\n\nJim wishes to exclude Steve Stifler from the wedding, who becomes upset when he finds out. Stifler agrees to teach Jim how to dance if he is allowed at the wedding. Jim asks Stifler to mask his obnoxious personality in exchange for planning the [[bachelor party]].\n\nJim, Stifler, Paul Finch, and Kevin Meyers travel to [[Chicago]] to find the designer who makes the [[wedding dress|dress]] Michelle wants. Stifler inadvertently walks into a [[gay bar]], and his initially raucous behavior gets several patrons annoyed. Battling Bear in a dance-off, Stifler is offered [[strippers]] by him for the bachelor party. Dress designer Leslie reveals himself and agrees to make the dress for Michelle.\n\nMichelle's younger sister, Cadence, flies in for the wedding. Both Finch and Stifler are attracted to her, and, trying to win her over, they each act differently. Stifler arranges the bachelor party but does not tell Jim, who unknowingly invited Michelle's parents to dinner in his home. With assistance from Bear, who poses as a [[butler]], Jim nearly succeeds in keeping the bachelor's party a secret, until Michelle's mother opens a closet door to find Kevin inside; blindfolded, stripped to his boxers, and tied to a chair. They explain that it was a failed attempt to make Jim seem like a hero, and Michelle's parents tell him if he puts that much effort into the upcoming marriage, they can give their blessing.\n\nMichelle is concerned that Jim's paternal grandmother disapproves of the wedding as she is not [[Jewish]]. On the night before the wedding, Stifler inadvertently turns off the walk-in refrigerator while getting a bottle of champagne to seduce Cadence, which kills the flowers. Stifler finally reveals his true rude and obnoxious personality. Angry, Jim asks him to leave, and all the others, including Cadence (who has heard him talking about doing her), support Jim's decision.\n\nFeeling guilty for his thoughtless behavior, Stifler convinces the [[florist]] to put together a new batch of flowers, and he enlists the help of his football players and Bear. As a gesture of remorse, he also gives a rose to Cadence. Moved by his actions, she agrees to have sex with him in a supply closet before the ceremony, but Stifler's presence is delayed by a brief meeting Jim calls among his [[groomsmen]], citing how he is grateful to have friends like them. \n\nQuickly returning to the hotel, Stifler hears someone in the supply closet and steps inside, unaware that Cadence was interrupted by wedding preparations and that Jim's disgruntled grandmother was shoved inside by the ushers, the \"[[MILF]] guys\" from high school. Stifler only realizes this upon walk-in by Finch and Kevin. She becomes pleasant, particularly towards Stifler, making Michelle and Jim's dad happy.\n\nDespite the chaotic events leading up to it, Michelle and Jim get married. At the reception, the couple dances while Stifler dances with Cadence. Finch sits by himself when Stifler's mom arrives. Although agreeing they are over each other, Stifler's mom mentions having a hotel suite and invites Finch to join her. The film ends with the \"MILF guys\" (Justin and John) spying on Stifler's mom and Finch having sex in the [[hot tub]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- THE CAST LIST IS ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as [[Jim Levenstein]]\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as [[Steve Stifler]]\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as [[Michelle Flaherty]]\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as [[List of American Pie characters#Paul Finch|Paul Finch]]\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as [[List of American Pie characters#Kevin Myers|Kevin Myers]]\n* [[January Jones]] as Cadence Flaherty\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Jim's Dad\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Jim's Mom\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Mary Flaherty\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Harold Flaherty\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Grandma\n* [[Eric Allan Kramer]] as Bear\n* [[Amanda Swisten]] as Fraulein Brandi\n* [[Nikki Schieler Ziering]] as Officer Krystal\n* [[Lawrence Pressman]] as Head Coach\n* Reynaldo Gallegos as Leslie Summers\n* [[Loren Lester]] as Celebrant\n* Justin Isfeld as Justin\n* [[John Cho]] as John\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Stifler's Mom\n* [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1946)|Julie Payne]] as Mrs. Zyskowski\n* [[Willam Belli]] as Butch Queen\n* [[David St. James]] as Front Desk Manager\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe outdoor wedding scene was filmed at the [[Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay]] near San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Filming Locations for American Wedding (American Pie 3) (2003)|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/American-Pie-3.php|access-date=2022-01-19|website=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack includes songs by [[Van Morrison]], [[Blue October]], [[The Working Title]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[American Hi-Fi]], [[Sum 41]], the [[All-American Rejects]], [[Joseph Arthur]], [[New Found Glory]], and [[Hot Action Cop]].
