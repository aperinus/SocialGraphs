It is the third film featuring the eccentric duo [[Wallace and Gromit]], following ''[[A Grand Day Out]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Wrong Trousers]]'' (1993). In ''A Close Shave'', Wallace and Gromit uncover a plot to [[rustling|rustle]] sheep by a sinister dog. This was the first Wallace and Gromit film featuring speaking characters other than Wallace.\n\nLike ''The Wrong Trousers'', it won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=The 68th Academy Awards (1996) Nominees and Winners |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1996 |access-date=24 September 2012 |website=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=25 March 1996}}</ref> ''A Close Shave'' has the first appearance of the character Shaun, who would later be the protagonist of the ''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'' spin-off television series and two feature films: ''[[Shaun the Sheep Movie]]'' (2015) and ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]'' (2019).\n\n== Plot ==<!--DO NOT EXPAND THIS PLOT SUMMARY. this is a short film and does not require a long summary. See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]-->\n\nThe inventor Wallace and his dog Gromit operate a window cleaning business. Wallace falls for wool shopkeeper Wendolene Ramsbottom ([[Anne Reid]]); her sinister dog, Preston, rustles sheep to supply the shop. After a lost sheep wanders into the house, Wallace places him in his Knit-o-Matic, which shears sheep and knits the wool into jumpers, and names him [[Shaun the Sheep|Shaun]]. Preston steals the Knit-o-Matic blueprints.\n\nWhile Gromit investigates Preston, Preston captures him and frames him for the sheep rustling. Gromit is arrested and imprisoned, while Wallace's house is inundated with sheep. Wallace and the sheep rescue Gromit and hide out in the fields. Wendolene and Preston arrive in the lorry to round up the sheep. When Wendolene demands Preston stop the rustling, he locks her in the lorry with the sheep and drives away, intent on turning them into dog food.\n\nWallace and Gromit give chase on their motorcycle. When Gromit's sidecar detaches, he activates its aeroplane mode and resumes the chase from the air. Wallace becomes trapped in the lorry and he, Wendolene and the sheep are transported to Preston's factory, where Preston has built an enormous Knit-o-Matic. The captives are loaded into the wash basin, but Shaun escapes. Shaun activates neon signs to reveal the factory's location to Gromit, who attacks Preston. Shaun sucks Preston into the Knit-o-Matic, removing his fur. Wendolene reveals that Preston is actually a robot created by her inventor father for good, but became evil.\n\nWhen the Knit-o-Matic dresses Preston in a sweater made of his fur, he inadvertently hits the controls, and the group become poised to fall into the mincing machine. Shaun pushes Preston into the machine, crushing him. Gromit is exonerated and Wallace rebuilds Preston as a harmless remote controlled dog.<!--DO NOT EXPAND THIS PLOT SUMMARY. this is a short film and does not require a long summary.
