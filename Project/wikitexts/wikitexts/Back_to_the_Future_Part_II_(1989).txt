It is the [[sequel]] to the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and the second installment in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]], [[Elisabeth Shue]] (replacing [[Claudia Wells]]), and [[Jeffrey Weissman]] (replacing [[Crispin Glover]]), and follows [[Marty McFly]] (Fox) and his friend [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd) as they travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future. When their arch-nemesis [[Biff Tannen]] (Wilson) steals Doc's [[DeLorean time machine]] and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline.\n\nThe film was produced on a $40 million budget and was filmed [[Back to back film production|back to back]] with its sequel ''[[Back to the Future Part III|Part III]]''. Filming began in February 1989, after two years were spent building the sets and writing the scripts. ''Back to the Future Part II'' was also a ground-breaking project for visual effects studio [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM). In addition to [[digital compositing]], ILM used the VistaGlide motion control camera system, which allowed an actor to portray multiple characters simultaneously on-screen without sacrificing camera movement.\n\n''Back to the Future Part II'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 22, 1989. The film initially received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $332 million worldwide in its initial run, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 1989]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nOn October 26, 1985, [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett Brown]] arrives unexpectedly in the [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]] [[time travel|time machine]] at Marty\u2019s front yard after the events of the [[Back to the Future|1st film]]. Doc persuades [[Marty McFly]] and his girlfriend, {{sublink|List of Back to the Future characters|Jennifer Parker}}, to travel to the future with him{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of ''[[Back to the Future]]''.}} and help their future children, with [[Biff Tannen]] witnessing their departure. They arrive on October 21, 2015, where Doc electronically incapacitates Jennifer and leaves her asleep in an alley, explaining that she should not have too much knowledge of future events. He has Marty pose as his son and lookalike Marty Jr. to refuse an offer to participate in a robbery with Biff's grandson [[Griff Tannen|Griff]], thus saving Marty Jr. from prison.\n\nMarty switches places with Marty Jr. and refuses Griff's offer, but Griff goads Marty into a fight, and a subsequent hoverboard chase ensues. Griff and his gang are arrested, saving Marty's future children. Before rejoining Doc, Marty purchases an [[almanac]] containing the results of major sporting events from 1950 to 2000. Doc discovers it and warns Marty about profiting from time travel. Before Doc can adequately dispose of it, they are interrupted by the police, who have found Jennifer incapacitated and are taking her to her 2015 home. They pursue, as does the elderly Biff, who has overheard their conversation and retrieved the discarded almanac.\n\nJennifer wakes up in her 2015 home and hides from the McFly family. She overhears that her future self's life with Marty is not what she expected, due to his involvement in an automobile accident. She witnesses Marty being goaded by his co-worker, Douglas Needles, into a shady business deal, resulting in Marty's firing. Jennifer tries to escape the house but faints after encountering her 2015 self. While Marty and Doc attend to her, Biff steals the time machine to give the almanac to his younger self, then returns to 2015. Marty, Doc, and an unconscious Jennifer return to 1985, unaware of Biff's actions. They leave Jennifer on her front porch.\n\nThe 1985 they return to has changed dramatically, with Biff now one of the country's wealthiest and most corrupt men. He has turned Hill Valley into a chaotic [[dystopia]], secretly killed Marty's father, [[George McFly|George]], in 1973, and forced Marty's mother, [[Lorraine McFly|Lorraine]], to marry him. Doc has also been committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]. Doc deduces that old Biff took the time machine to give his younger self the almanac, and Marty learns from the alternate 1985 Biff that he received it on November 12, 1955. Biff tries to kill Marty, but Marty flees and travels to 1955 with Doc.\n\nMarty secretly follows the 1955 Biff and watches him receive the almanac from his 2015 self. Marty then follows him to the high school dance, carefully avoiding interrupting the events from his previous visit. After several fruitless attempts, Marty finally gets the almanac, leaving Biff to crash into a manure truck. Marty burns the almanac, nullifying the changes to the timeline that it had caused, as Doc hovers above in the time machine. Before Marty can join him, the DeLorean is struck by lightning and disappears. A [[Western Union]] courier arrives immediately after and delivers a letter to Marty; it is from Doc, who explains that the lightning strike transported him 70 years in the past to 1885.{{refn|group=N|The letter's contents are later explored further in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.}} Marty races back into town to find the 1955 Doc, who had just helped Marty to return to 1985. Shocked by Marty's sudden reappearance, Doc faints.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Back to the Future characters}}\n[[File:Bttf2cast.png|thumb|275px|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Michael J.

He later agreed to do a sequel, but only if Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returned as well. With Fox and Lloyd confirmed, Zemeckis met with screenwriting partner [[Bob Gale]] to create a story for the sequel. Zemeckis and Gale would later regret that they ended the first one with Jennifer in the car with Marty and Doc Brown, because it required them to come up with a story that would fit her in, rather than a whole new adventure.<ref name=making />\n\nGale wrote most of the first draft by himself as Zemeckis was busy making ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. At first, the film's third act was to take place in 1967 where Lorraine was a flower child [[Vietnam War protest|protesting the war]] and George was a college professor at [[University of Berkeley|Berkeley]], but Zemeckis later stated that the [[time paradox]]es of it provided a good opportunity to go back to 1955 and see the first film's events in a different light. While most of the original cast agreed to return, a major stumbling block arose when negotiating Crispin Glover's fee for reprising the role of George McFly. When it became clear that he would not return, the role was rewritten so that George is dead when the action takes place in the alternative version of 1985.<ref name=making>{{cite video | people = [[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Bob Gale]] | chapter =Back to the Future Feature: Making the Trilogy Part 2 | title = Back to the Future Part II |type=DVD | publisher =[[Universal Pictures]]| location = Los Angeles |year=2005}}</ref>\n\nThe greatest challenge was the creation of the futuristic vision of Marty's hometown in 2015.  Production designer [[Rick Carter]] wanted to create a very detailed image with a different tone from the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', wishing to get past the smoke and chrome.  Carter and his crew spent months plotting, planning, and preparing Hill Valley's transformation into a city of the future.<ref name=featurette /> Visual effects art director John Bell stated they had no script to work with, only the indications that the setting would be 30 years into the future featuring \"something called hoverboards\".<ref name=up />\n\nWhen writing the script for ''Part II'', Gale wanted to push the first film's ideas further for humorous effect. Zemeckis said he was somewhat concerned about portraying the future because of the risk of making wildly inaccurate predictions. According to Gale, they tried to make the future a nice place, \"where what's wrong is due to who lives in the future as opposed to the technology\" in contrast to the pessimistic, [[Orwellian]] future seen in most science fiction.<ref name=making /> To keep production costs low and take advantage of an extended break Fox had from ''[[Family Ties]]'' (which was ending its run when filming began), it was shot [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with sequel ''[[Back to the Future Part III|Part III]]''.<ref name=back>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-04/entertainment/ca-1660_1_back-to-back-sequels|title=Back-to-Back Sequels for 'Back to Future'|date=February 4, 1989|first=Steve|last=Weinstein|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309003854/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-04/entertainment/ca-1660_1_back-to-back-sequels|archive-date=March 9, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nTwo years were needed to finish building the sets and writing the scripts before shooting could begin. During filming, the creation of the appearance of the aged characters was a well-guarded secret, involving state-of-the-art make-up techniques. Fox described the process as very time-consuming: \"it took over four hours, although it could be worse\".<ref name=\"making\" /> [[Principal photography]] began on February 20, 1989.<ref name=back /> For a three-week period near the end of the filming, the crew split and, while most remained dedicated to shooting ''Part III'', a few, including Gale, focused on finishing its predecessor. Zemeckis himself slept only a few hours per day, supervising both films, having to fly between [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where it was being finished, and other locations in California for ''Part III''.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Bob Gale]] | chapter =Back to the Future Feature: Making the Trilogy Part 3 | title = ''Back to the Future Part III'' DVD | publisher =[[Universal Pictures]]| location = Los Angeles |year=2005}}</ref>\n\nThe film was considered one of the most ground-breaking projects for [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. It was one of the effects house's first forays into [[digital compositing]], as well as the VistaGlide [[motion control photography|motion control]] camera system, which enabled them to shoot one of its most complex sequences, in which Fox played three separate characters (Marty Sr., Marty Jr., and Marlene), all of whom interacted with each other. Although such scenes were not new, the VistaGlide allowed, for the first time, a completely dynamic scene in which camera movement could finally be incorporated. The technique was also used in scenes where Fox, Thomas F. Wilson, Christopher Lloyd, and Elisabeth Shue's characters encounter and interact with their counterparts.<ref name=making /> It also includes a brief moment of [[computer-generated imagery]] in a [[hologram|holographic]] shark used to promote a fictional ''[[Jaws (franchise)|Jaws]] 19'', which wound up unaltered from the first test done by ILM's digital department because effects supervisor [[Ken Ralston]] \"liked the fact that it was all messed up.\"<ref name=up>{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/2014/11/back-to-the-future-ii-predictions-art-director/2/|title='Back to the Future II's Art Director Tells Us How They Developed The Film's Somewhat Misguided Predictions|first=Chloe|last=Schildhause|publisher=Uproxx|date=November 25, 2014|access-date=January 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106162508/http://uproxx.com/movies/2014/11/back-to-the-future-ii-predictions-art-director/2/|archive-date=January 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAnimation supervisor [[Wes Takahashi]], who then was the head of ILM's animation department, worked heavily on the film's time travel sequences, as he had done in the original film and in ''Part III''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=October 21, 2015|title=The future is today: how ILM made time travel possible|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/the-future-is-today-how-ilm-made-time-travel-possible-frame-by-frame/|website=FXGuide|access-date=June 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701211801/https://www.fxguide.com/featured/the-future-is-today-how-ilm-made-time-travel-possible-frame-by-frame/|archive-date=July 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://itu.edu/digital-arts/faculty/|title=Digital Arts Faculty|publisher=International Technological University|access-date=June 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812215132/http://itu.edu/digital-arts/faculty/|archive-date=August 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As ''Part II'' neared release, sufficient footage of ''Part III'' had been shot to allow a trailer to be assembled.

He expressed interest but could not come to an agreement with the producers regarding his salary. He stated in a 1992 interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' that the producers' highest offer was $125,000, less than half of what the other returning cast members were offered. Gale has since asserted that Glover's demands were excessive for an actor of his professional stature at that time.<ref name=\"timeflies\" /> In an interview on the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' show in 2013, Glover stated that his primary reason for not doing ''Part II'' was a philosophical disagreement on the film's message; Glover felt the story rewarded the characters with financial gain, such as Marty's truck, rather than love.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcG61w474zY |title=\"Back to the Future\" Conspiracies, Alternate Endings, & Lawsuits with Crispin Glover |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=June 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016213140/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcG61w474zY |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nRather than write George out of the film, Zemeckis used previously filmed footage of Glover from the first film as well as new footage of actor [[Jeffrey Weissman]], who wore [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]] including a false chin, nose, and cheekbones to resemble Glover. Various techniques were used to obfuscate the Weissman footage, such as placing him in the background rather than the foreground, having him wear sunglasses, and hanging him upside down. Glover filed a lawsuit against the producers of the film on the grounds that they neither owned his likeness nor had permission to use it. As a result of the suit, there are now clauses in the [[Screen Actors Guild]] collective bargaining agreements stating that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Glover |first=Crispin |subject-link=Crispin Glover |interviewer=[[Simon Mayo]], [[Mark Kermode]] |title=Crispin Glover on Back to the Future 2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q7wGsVYydo |via=YouTube |work=Kermode & Mayo |publisher=[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] |location=London |date=February 2011 |access-date=April 11, 2011 |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016212931/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q7wGsVYydo |url-status=live }}<!-- This clip was uploaded by the official account of the BBC Radio 5Live program.--></ref> Glover's legal action, while resolved outside of the courts, has been considered as a key case in [[personality rights]] for actors with increasing use of improved special effects and digital techniques, in which actors may have agreed to appear in one part of a production but have their likenesses be used in another without their agreement.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/back-future-ii-a-legal-833705 | title = 'Back to the Future II\" From a Legal Perspective: Unintentionally Visionary | first = Eriq | last = Gardner | date = October 21, 2015 | access-date = May 12, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | archive-date = May 10, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200510224933/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/back-future-ii-a-legal-833705 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927032/cgi-digital-actor-replacement-cinema-gemini-man-the-congress-rogue-one-legality | title = Cinema's Digital Impostors Are Coming | first = Charles | last = Bramesco | date = October 22, 2019 | access-date = May 12, 2020 | work = [[The Verge]] | archive-date = April 20, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200420013246/https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927032/cgi-digital-actor-replacement-cinema-gemini-man-the-congress-rogue-one-legality | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n=== Replacement of Claudia Wells ===\n[[File:Jennifer1&2.png|thumb|right|Claudia Wells' scene at the end of ''Back to the Future'' (top) was reshot with Elisabeth Shue for the beginning of ''Part II'' (bottom).]]\n[[Claudia Wells]], who had played Marty's girlfriend Jennifer Parker in the first film, planned to reprise her role, but turned it down due to family reasons \u2013 reportedly to care for her mother, who was ill with cancer at the time of filming the second film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/back-to-the-futures-claud_b_7742682|title=Back to the Future's Claudia Wells: Shining Brighter Than Ever Before|date=July 7, 2015|website=HuffPost}}</ref> The producers cast [[Elisabeth Shue]] instead, which involved re-shooting the closing scenes of the first film for the beginning of ''Part II''.
