The film is based on the [[High Fidelity (novel)|1995 British novel of the same name]] by [[Nick Hornby]], with the setting moved from London to Chicago and the protagonist's name changed. Hornby expressed surprise at how faithful the adaptation was, saying \"at times, it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2009/03/23/high-fidelity |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726080642/http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2009/03/23/high-fidelity/ |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |title=Strangely Romantic in a Way |work=This Distracted Globe |access-date=October 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[breakup]] with his most recent girlfriend, Rob Gordon recounts his most painful breakups, seeking to find a reason for his failed romances. The film is styled around Rob talking to the camera and narrating his own story.\n\nCusack was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\nRob Gordon is a music-loving man with a poor understanding of women. After being dumped by his long-term girlfriend, Laura, he tries to understand how he failed in his relationships by seeking out his old partners.\n\nBy day, he works at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where customers drift through. He and his employees Dick and Barry, armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, compile \"Top 5\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and sell few records.\n\nTwo shoplifting, skateboarding teenagers, Vince and Justin, are an annoyance to them until Rob listens to a recording that they made as The Kinky Wizards. He offers them a record deal, the first under his own label, Top 5 Records. During his off-hours, he pines for Laura and tries to win her back.\n\nLaura's father, who liked Rob, dies. Rob attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he has always had one foot out of the door and never committed to her\u2014and in doing so, neglected his own future. They resume living together. He meets a music columnist and develops a crush, but wonders while making a mixtape for her if he would always be jumping from rock to rock.\n\nRob tells Laura that other women are just fantasies, Laura is reality, and he never tires of her. He proposes marriage; she thanks him for asking. She arranges for him to revisit his former love of [[disk jockey|dee-jaying]]. At the celebration of the newly released single by Vince and Justin, where Barry's band Sonic Death Monkey plays \"[[Let's Get It On (song)|Let's Get It On]]\", Rob is surprised that Barry's band is not a disaster.\n\nRob makes a mixtape for Laura and feels he has finally learned how to make her happy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Rob Gordon\n* [[Iben Hjejle]] as Laura\n* [[Jack Black]] as Barry Judd\n* [[Todd Louiso]] as Dick\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Charlie Nicholson\n* [[Lisa Bonet]] as Marie DeSalle\n* [[Sara Gilbert]] as Anaugh Moss\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Sarah Kendrew\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Liz\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Ian \"Ray\" Raymond\n* [[Joelle Carter]] as Penny Hardwick\n* Chris Rehmann as Vince\n* Ben Carr as Justin\n* [[Natasha Gregson Wagner]] as Caroline Fortis\n* [[Drake Bell]] as young Rob Gordon\n* [[Bruce Springsteen]] as himself {{small|(cameo)}}\n* [[Ian Williams (musician)|Ian Williams]] as a guy in record store {{small|(cameo)}}\n* [[US Maple|Al Johnson]] as a record store geek\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nNick Hornby's book was optioned by [[Disney]]'s [[Touchstone Pictures]] in 1995, where it went into development for three years.<ref name=\"Malanowski\">{{cite news | last = Malanowski | first = Jamie | title = Keeping Faith with ''High Fidelity'' | work = [[New York Times]] | date = April 2, 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/02/movies/film-keeping-faith-with-high-fidelity.html | access-date = March 27, 2009 }}</ref> [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] was slated to direct the film with a script written by ''[[Con Air]]'' screenwriter [[Scott Rosenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Buss|first=Andrew|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/04/high-fidelity-oral-history/|title=Top Five: An Oral History of ''High Fidelity''|date=April 1, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaye|first=Ben|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/04/high-fidelity-writers-not-credited-hulu-tv-remake/|title=''High Fidelity'' Film Screenwriters Say Hulu TV Series Lifted Their Work Without Attribution|date=April 2, 2020|website=Consequence of Sound|access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref> Disney executive [[Joe Roth]] had a conversation with recording executive Kathy Nelson, who recommended John Cusack and his writing and producing partners D.

However, Rosenberg eventually refused to do so, leading to a [[WGA screenwriting credit system#Notable conflicts|writing credit dispute]].
