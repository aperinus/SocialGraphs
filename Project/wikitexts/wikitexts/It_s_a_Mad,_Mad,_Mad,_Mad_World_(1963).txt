The film, starring [[Spencer Tracy]] with an [[all-star cast]] of comedians, is about the madcap pursuit of $350,000 in stolen cash by a diverse and colorful group of strangers. It premiered on November 7, 1963.<ref name=\"WVrev\">{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/it-s-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world-1200420392/| title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=November 6, 1963| page=6| access-date=March 8, 2020| archive-date=October 31, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031082033/https://variety.com/1962/film/reviews/it-s-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world-1200420392/| url-status=live}}</ref> The principal cast features [[Edie Adams]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Buddy Hackett]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Dorothy Provine]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Dick Shawn]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Terry-Thomas]], and [[Jonathan Winters]].\n\nThe film marked the first time Kramer directed a comedy, though he had produced the comedy ''[[So This Is New York]]'' in 1948. He is best known for producing and directing, in his own words, \"heavy drama\" about [[social problem film|social problems]], such as ''[[The Defiant Ones]]'', ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', and ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''. His first attempt at directing a comedy film paid off immensely as ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' became a critical and commercial success in 1963 and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and two [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\nAgainst Kramer's wishes, the film suffered severe cuts by its distributor [[United Artists]] in order to give the film a shorter running time for its general release. On October 15, 2013, it was announced that [[the Criterion Collection]] had collaborated with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], United Artists, and film restoration expert [[Robert A. Harris]] to reconstruct and restore ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' to be as close as possible to the original 202-minute version envisioned by Kramer.

Five motorists stop to help him: Melville Crump, a dentist on a second honeymoon with his wife Monica; Lennie Pike, a furniture mover; Ding Bell and Benjy Benjamin, two friends on their way to Las Vegas; and J. Russell Finch, a seaweed-business owner, traveling with his wife Emmeline and his loud, obnoxious mother-in-law Mrs. Marcus. Just before he dies, Grogan tells them about $350,000 ($3.2 million, today)<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ian|last=Webster|title=Value of $350,000 from 1963 to 2022|url=https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1963?amount=350000|website=in2013dollars.com|publisher=Alioth Finance|editor=Official Inflation Data|date=January 12, 2022|access-date=February 8, 2022}}</ref> buried in Santa Rosita State Park under \u201ca big W\u201d. After the group fails to come up with a satisfactory way to split the money, they decide to race to find it.  Unbeknownst to all, Captain Culpeper, chief of detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, who had been working the Grogan case for years and hoped to solve it and retire, has everyone tracked.\n\nAll the motorists experience setbacks on the way to the park. The Crumps charter a rickety biplane to Santa Rosita. When they stop in a hardware store for supplies, they are inadvertently locked in the store's basement. After several failed attempts to break out, they blow out the wall of the basement with dynamite and hire a cab to get to the park. Bell and Benjamin charter a modern plane, but, when their alcoholic pilot knocks himself out, they have to land the plane themselves, causing chaos among the air traffic controllers as the plane flies wildly out of control. After bringing the plane to the ground, they also hire a cab to drive them to the park. The Finches' car collides with Pike's furniture van, and Russell persuades British Army Lieutenant Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne to drive them to Santa Rosita. After a nasty argument, Mrs. Marcus and Emeline leave to hitch their own ride.\n\nPike stops motorist Otto Meyer for a ride; however, after Pike tells Meyer about the money, Meyer abandons him and convinces two service station employees to detain Pike. Pike destroys the station, steals a tow truck, and picks up Mrs. Marcus and Emmeline. Mrs. Marcus calls her dimwitted son Sylvester, who lives near the park; however, she claims Russell \"assaulted\" her, causing Sylvester to panic and drive towards her instead of getting the money for her. Meyer, meanwhile, picks up a stranded motorist and helps him get back home. Trying to get back to the highway, Meyer fails at crossing a deep river and his car is swept away, forcing him to steal another motorist's car.\n\nMeanwhile, Culpepper has a furious argument with his wife and daughter, then is told his pension will be a pittance, and has a mental breakdown. He instructs all the law enforcement following the motorists to back off on his signal \u2013 because none of the motorists know him \u2013 and heads for the park. After many mishaps, everyone reaches the Park and begins searching for the \"big W\". Culpeper gives the pre-arranged signal and goes in alone. Emmeline finds the \"big W\" first, quickly followed by Pike, who tells the others. After the money is dug up, Culpeper identifies himself, but does not arrest them. He persuades the motorists to turn themselves in.\n\nChief Aloysius successfully blackmails the mayor into tripling Culpeper\u2019s pension. He tries to get word of this to Culpeper, but fails because Culpeper has already gone after the stolen money. Figuring out Culpeper\u2019s real motivation, the police chief sadly orders his friend\u2019s arrest. Suspicious about why Culpeper let them go, the motorists follow him and notice he is not returning to the police station. They chase him to a condemned building, where the men corner him on a rickety fire escape which breaks because of their combined weight. In the struggle, Culpeper drops the briefcase containing the money, scattering the cash to a crowd of people in the street below. When they all pile onto a fire department ladder sent to rescue them, their combined weight causes it to spin uncontrollably and toss them wildly in different directions, leaving most of them heavily injured.\n\nIn the prison hospital, the men bemoan the loss of the money and blame their injuries on Culpeper. Culpeper responds that because of his lost pension, the ruined relationship with his family and the likelihood that the judge will probably be lenient with them but throw the book at him, it will be a long time before he laughs again. Mrs. Marcus, flanked by Emmeline and Monica (all in prison attire) enters and begins loudly berating the men, only to slip on Benjamin's dropped banana peel. All the men except Sylvester roar with laughter, and, after a brief hesitation, Culpeper joins in.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Principal cast===\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Captain T. G.

He sent an outline to Kramer, who agreed to produce and direct the film. The setting was shifted to America, and the working title changed to ''Where, but in America?'' then ''One Damn Thing After Another'' and then ''It's a Mad World'', with Rose and Kramer adding additional ''Mad''s to the title as time progressed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=9069&s=Features| title=Behind the Mad-ness&nbsp;\u2013 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World| website=Urban Cinephile| date=July 1, 2004| access-date=September 2, 2009| archive-date=November 18, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118163057/http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=9069&s=Features| url-status=dead}}</ref> Kramer considered adding a fifth \"mad\" to the title before deciding it was redundant but noted in interviews that he later regretted it.\n\nAlthough well known for serious films such as ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' and ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (both starring Tracy), Kramer set out to make the ultimate comedy film. Filmed in [[Ultra Panavision 70]] and presented in [[Cinerama]] (becoming one of the early single-camera Cinerama features produced), ''Mad World'' had an all-star cast, with dozens of major comedy stars from all eras of cinema appearing in it. The film followed a Hollywood trend in the 1960s of producing \"epic\" films as a way of wooing audiences away from television and back to movie theaters. The film's theme music was written by [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]] with lyrics by [[Mack David]]. Kramer hosted a roundtable (including extensive clips) on the film with stars Caesar, Hackett and Winters as part of a special ''The Comedians, Stanley Kramer's Reunion with the Great Comedy Artists of Our Time'' broadcast in 1974 as part of ''[[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection| title=Stanley Kramer Collection| website=UCLA Film & Television Archive| access-date=March 8, 2020| archive-date=June 11, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611153615/https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection| url-status=live}}</ref> The last reported showing of the film on major network television in America was on ABC on July 16, 1979,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19790711&id=pJUiAAAAIBAJ&pg=1557,1848829| title='Mad World' Repeats| newspaper=[[The Item|The Daily Item]]| location=Sumter, South Carolina| date=July 16, 1979| page=6B| access-date=January 16, 2016| archive-date=May 20, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210520130906/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19790711&id=pJUiAAAAIBAJ&pg=1557%2C1848829| url-status=live}}</ref> and before that, on CBS on May 16, 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66| title=Television| magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]| page=66| date=May 18, 1978| publisher=Johnson Publishing Company| access-date=March 8, 2020| archive-date=May 20, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210520130703/https://books.google.com/books?id=XEIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n{{More citations needed section|date= December 2015}}\n\nThe airport terminal scenes were filmed at the now-defunct Rancho Conejo Airport in Newbury Park, California, though the control tower shown was constructed only for filming. Other airplane sequences were filmed at the Sonoma County Airport north of Santa Rosa, California; at the Palm Springs International Airport; and in the skies above Thousand Oaks, California; Camarillo, California; and Orange County, California. In the Orange County scene, stuntman [[Frank Tallman]] flew a [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beech model C-18S]] through a highway billboard advertising [[Coca-Cola]]. A communications mix-up resulted in the use of linen graphic sheets on the sign rather than paper, as planned. Linen, much tougher than paper, damaged the plane on impact.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Tallman managed to fly it back to the airstrip, discovering that the leading edges of the wings had been smashed all the way back to the wing spars. Tallman considered that incident the closest he ever came to dying on film. (Both Tallman and [[Paul Mantz]], Tallman's business partner and fellow flier on ''Mad World'', eventually died in separate air crashes over a decade apart.)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/local/me-274_1_professional-pilot| title=Pilot Told of Bad Weather, FAA Says of Crash Killing 10| first1=Eric| last1=Malnic| first2=Louis| last2=Sahagun| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=February 22, 1989| access-date=July 20, 2017| archive-date=October 29, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029160229/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-22/local/me-274_1_professional-pilot| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://airportjournals.com/paul-mantz-and-the-last-flight-of-the-phoenix/| title=Paul Mantz and the Last Flight of the Phoenix| first=Henry M.| last=Holden| journal=Airport Journals| date=September 1, 2004| access-date=July 20, 2017| archive-date=July 30, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730210430/http://airportjournals.com/paul-mantz-and-the-last-flight-of-the-phoenix/| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mad1.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The hangar is at the [[Charles M.

(The original Cinerama process filmed scenes with three separate cameras. The three processed reels were projected by three electronically synchronized projectors onto a huge curved screen.) It originally was planned for three-camera Cinerama, and some reports state that initial filming was done using three cameras but was abandoned. One-camera Cinerama could be Super Panavision 70 or Ultra Panavision 70, which was essentially the [[Super Panavision 70]] process with anamorphic compression at the edges of the image to give a much wider aspect ratio.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} When projected by one projector, the expanded 70mm image filled the wide Cinerama screen. [[Ultra Panavision 70]] was used to film ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''. Other films shot in Ultra Panavision 70 and released in Cinerama include ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', ''[[The Hallelujah Trail]]'', ''[[Battle of the Bulge (1965 film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'', and ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]''. Super Panavision 70 films released in Cinerama include ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Animated credit sequence===\nKramer's comedy was accentuated by many things, including the opening animated credits designed by [[Saul Bass]]. The film begins with mention of Spencer Tracy, then the \"in alphabetical order\" mention of nine of the main cast (Berle, Caesar, Hackett, Merman, Rooney, Shawn, Silvers, Terry-Thomas, Winters), followed by hands switching these nine names two to three times over. Animation continues with paper dolls and a windup toy world spinning with several men hanging on to it and finishing with a man opening a door to the globe and getting trampled by a mad crowd. One of the animators who helped with the sequence was future ''[[Peanuts]]'' animator [[Bill Melendez]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) - Roadshow Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=27|right|Original roadshow [[teaser trailer]] for ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''.]]\n\nThe film opened at the newly built [[Cinerama Dome]] in Los Angeles on November 7, 1963.
