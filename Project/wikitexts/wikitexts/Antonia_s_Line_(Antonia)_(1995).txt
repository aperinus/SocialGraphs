It enjoyed critical success and several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing World War II, the widow Antonia and her daughter Danielle arrive at Antonia's home town where her mother is dying. She reunites with her old friend Crooked Finger, a depressed intellectual who refuses to leave his house. She also begins attracting a following, including Deedee, a mentally handicapped girl, after she is raped by her brother Pitte, and Loony Lips, a simple-minded man who falls in love with Deedee. A pariah, Pitte flees the village. Antonia turns down an offer of marriage from Farmer Bas, but develops a lasting romance with him.\n\nDanielle, who has a vivid imagination, becomes an artist and expresses interest in raising a child, while rejecting the idea of having a husband. Antonia and Danielle visit the city to find a man to impregnate Danielle, resulting in the birth of Ther\u00e8se, a [[child prodigy]]. Danielle falls in love with Ther\u00e8se's tutor, Lara, and they remain together in a [[lesbian]] relationship. Ther\u00e8se develops an understanding and kinship with Crooked Finger beyond what Danielle could be capable of.\n\nYears later, Pitte returns to town to collect his inheritance and rapes Ther\u00e8se. Antonia places a curse on him, after which he is beaten by men of the village and drowned by his brother. Ther\u00e8se is unable to find her intellectual match but eventually has a relationship with a childhood friend, resulting in her pregnancy. She decides to keep the baby and gives birth to Sarah, the film's narrator, who has a fascination with death. Sarah observes many of her elders die off, including Crooked Finger who commits suicide, and Loony Lips who suffers a tractor accident on the farm. Antonia later dies of old age, surrounded by family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Willeke van Ammelrooy]] as Antonia\n* [[Els Dottermans]] as Danielle\n* [[Jan Decleir]] as Farmer Bas\n* [[Victor L\u00f6w]] as Harry\n* [[Johan Heldenbergh]] as Tom\n* [[Dora van der Groen]] as Allegonde\n* Veerle van Overloop as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\n* Esther Vriesendorp as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (aged 13)\n* [[:nl:Carolien Karthaus|Carolien Spoor]] as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (aged 6)\n* Thyrza Ravesteijn as Sarah\n* Mil Seghers as Kromme Vinger (also called Crooked Finger)\n* [[Elsie de Brauw]] as Lara\n* [[:nl:Reinout Bussemaker|Reinout Bussemaker]] as Simon\n* [[:nl:Marina de Graaf|Marina de Graaf]] as Deedee\n* [[:nl:Jan Steen (acteur)|Jan Steen]] as Lippen Willem (also called Loony Lips)\n* [[:nl:Catherine ten Bruggencate|Catherine ten Bruggencate]] as Malle Madonna (also called Mad Madonna)\n* [[:nl:Paul R.
