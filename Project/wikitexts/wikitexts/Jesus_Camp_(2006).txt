The film focuses on three of the children who attended the camp in the summer of 2005&mdash;Levi, Rachael, and Tory (Victoria). The film cuts between footage of the camp and a children's prayer conference held just before the camp at Christ Triumphant Church, a large charismatic church in [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]], a suburb of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].\n\nAll three children are already very devout Christians. Levi has preached several sermons at his father's church, Rock of Ages Church in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]. He is [[homeschool]]ed, his mother explaining that God did not give her a child just so he could be raised by someone else eight hours a day. He learns science from books and videos that attempt to reconcile [[young-earth creationism]] with scientific principles,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wile |first=Jay L. |date=2000 |title=Exploring Creation With Physical Science|publisher=Apologia Press }}</ref> and that [[climate change]] is mere political speculation. Levi preaches a sermon at the camp in which he declares that his generation is key to [[Second Coming|bringing Jesus back]].  Rachael, who also attends Levi's church (her father was assistant pastor at the time), is seen praying over a bowling ball during a game early in the film, and evangelizes to strangers, telling them that Jesus loves them. She does not think highly of non-charismatic churches (or \"dead churches\" as she calls them), feeling they are not \"churches that God likes to go to.\" Tory is a member of the Children's Praise Dance Team at Christ Triumphant Church. She is observed dancing to [[Christian rock]] music, and says she has to check herself to make sure she is not \"dancing for the flesh.\"\n\nAt the camp, Fischer stresses the need for children to purify themselves in order to be part of the \"army of God.\" She strongly believes that children need to be in the forefront of turning America toward [[christian right|conservative Christian]] values. She also feels that Christians need to focus on training kids since \"the enemy\" (radical Islam) is focused on training theirs. She compares the preparation she is giving children with the training of terrorists in the Middle East. \"I want to see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam,\" she tells the camera. \"I want to see them radically laying down their lives for the gospel, as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glaister|first1=Den|title=They cry, pray to Bush and wash out the devil - welcome to ''Jesus Camp''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/29/usa.danglaister|access-date=9 August 2015|date=29 September 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nIn one scene shot at Christ Triumphant Church, a woman brings a life-sized cutout of [[George W. Bush]] to the front of the church and has the children stretch their hands toward him in prayer for him. This is derivative of the [[laying on of hands]], a common practice in charismatic Christian circles. In one very famous scene, Fischer rails hard against [[Harry Potter]], and infers that it is a gateway to joining the occult, in an attempt to scare the children into avoiding it. She infers that if Harry Potter was a real [[warlock]], and lived during the old testament era, that the Jews would have [[Stoning|stoned him]] to death. This aggressive attitude was a common position on the fantasy series, in the Evangelical community at the time. In another scene, [[Lou Engle]] preaches a message urging children to join the fight to end [[abortion]] in America. Children are shown a series of plastic models of developing fetuses, and have their mouths covered with red tape with \"Life\" written across it. Engle is a founder of the [[Justice House of Prayer]] and a leader of Harvest International Ministries, a network of charismatic-oriented ministries with which both the church and Fischer's ministry are affiliated. He prays for Bush to have the strength to appoint \"righteous judges\" who will overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. By the end of the sermon, the children are chanting, \"Righteous judges! Righteous judges!\"\n\nThere is also a scene at [[New Life Church, Colorado|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] where [[Ted Haggard]] preaches a sermon against [[homosexuality]]. Before the service, Levi mentioned how he admired Ted Haggard and was looking forward to meeting him. After the sermon, Levi informs Haggard that he has already preached sermons and wants to be a preacher when he grows up. Haggard advises him: \"I say, use your cute kid thing until you're thirty, and by then you'll have good content.\" Afterward, Levi, Rachael, Tory, their families and several other children take part in a Justice House of Prayer rally held by Engle in front of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].\n\nThroughout the movie, there are cut scenes to a debate between Fischer and [[Mike Papantonio]], an attorney and a radio talk-show host for [[Air America Radio]]'s ''[[Ring of Fire (radio program)|Ring of Fire]]''. Papantonio questions Fischer's motives for focusing her ministry efforts on children. Fischer explains that she does not believe that people are able to choose their belief system once they pass childhood, and that it is important that they be \"indoctrinated\" in evangelical Christian values from a young age. Fischer also explains that democracy is flawed and designed to destroy itself \"because we have to give everyone equal freedom\".\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus Camp'' was screened at [[Michael Moore]]'s [[Traverse City Film Festival]] against the wishes of the distribution company, Magnolia Pictures.<ref name=\"MooreShow\">{{cite news |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=4 August 2006 |title=Moore fest defies distrib over 'Jesus' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950410 |url-status=dead |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225110/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950410 |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> Magnolia had pulled ''Jesus Camp'' from the festival earlier in the summer after it purchased rights to the film, in a decision apparently inspired by Moore's association with the film festival, with Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles saying \"I don't want the perception out in the public that this is an agenda-laden film\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Eugene |date=6 August 2006 |title=When A Fest Strategy Goes Awry: Traverse City Screens \"Jesus Camp\" Against Magnolia's Wishes |url=http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/08/jesus_camps_uni.html |url-status=dead |newspaper=indieWire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820140511/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/08/jesus_camps_uni.html |archive-date=20 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe [[DVD]], released in January 2007, includes 15 [[deleted scenes]].<ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|title=Jesus Camp|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26184/jesus-camp/|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref> In one of them, Levi's father and mother suggest that a future president may well have been at Kids on Fire. In another, a woman takes several of the kids on a \"prayer walk\" through Lee's Summit, and later takes them to a [[crisis pregnancy center]].  A [[Planned Parenthood]] clinic is located next door, and the woman has the kids pray over it. In an interview, the [[anti-abortion]] clinic's director says that she was very pleased to see children so passionate about ending abortion.\n\nThe DVD also includes commentary by Grady and Ewing.<ref name=\"dvdtalk\" /> They reveal that when they arrived in Kansas City, there was a great deal of excitement over the nomination of [[Samuel Alito]] to the Supreme Court. However, according to Grady and Ewing, Fischer and the others did not see their activism for [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] causes as political, but as a matter of faith. They also reveal that Fischer and the others did not understand why some of the scenes of them [[speaking in tongues]] and praying over objects were included in the film, since such occurrences were second nature to them. Furthermore, on the DVD commentary, Heidi and Grady refer to the central character, Becky Fischer, as \"a great documentary subject\" because of her charisma.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Bill|title=Introduction to Documentary|date=2017|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-02685-9|pages=41|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Controversy===\nAccording to Ron Reno of [[Focus on the Family]], \n<blockquote>\nThe directors' claims that they were simply trying to create an 'objective' film about children and faith ring hollow. I don't question the motives of the Christians shown in the film. Indeed, the earnestness and zeal with which the young people pictured attempt to live out their faith are admirable. Unfortunately, however, it appears that they were unknowingly being manipulated by the directors in their effort to cast evangelical Christianity in an unflattering light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/videos/2006/q4/jesuscamp.aspx |title=Jesus Camp |publisher=Plugged In |access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn November 2006, Fischer announced that she would be shutting down the camp due to negative reaction towards her in the film. According to Fischer's website, the owners of the property used for the camp shown in the film were concerned about [[vandalism]] to the premises following the film's release and thus will not allow it to be used for any future camps. Fischer has said that the camp will be indefinitely postponed until other suitable premises can be found, but that it will be back.<ref name=\"Seattle news\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsinministry.com/ClosingDownCamp.html |title=Kids in Ministry: Are You Closing Jesus Camp Down?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103020010/http://www.kidsinministry.com/ClosingDownCamp.html |archive-date=3 January 2007|work=Kidsinministry.com}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Jesus Camp'' received an 87% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 7.26/10.
