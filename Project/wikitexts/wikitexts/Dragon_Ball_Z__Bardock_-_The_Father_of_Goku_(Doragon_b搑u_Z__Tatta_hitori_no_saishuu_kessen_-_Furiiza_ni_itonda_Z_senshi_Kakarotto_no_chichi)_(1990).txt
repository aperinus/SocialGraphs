It was broadcast on [[Fuji Television]] on October 17, 1990, between ''Dragon Ball Z'' episodes 63 and 64. It serves as a [[prequel]] to the ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]'' anime, taking place twelve years before the events in the [[Emperor Pilaf saga]]. [[AB Groupe]]'s title is '''''Dragon Ball Z: The Father of Goku'''''. In 2011, a sequel manga called ''[[Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock]]'' was created and adapted into a short film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:bardocksquad.png|thumb|left|The main protagonists of the film: Shugesh, Bardock, Borgos, Tora and Fasha]]\n[[Bardock]], a low-level Saiyan soldier and his crew are on an assignment to slaughter the inhabitants of Planet Kanassa. They manage to accomplish this by using the planet's full moon to transform into Great Apes. The next morning, Bardock and his crew rest and celebrate their victory until one surviving Kanassan warrior catches him off-guard and decides to give him the \"gift\" of [[precognition|seeing the future]] as his way to avenge his people, before being killed by Bardock who subsequently passes out. Bardock returns to Planet Vegeta to heal and visits his infant son, [[Goku|Kakarot]], who is being prepared to be sent to Earth in order to exterminate all life there. Bardock starts to have visions of Kakarot fighting future foes, as well as Planet Vegeta's destruction at the hands of [[Frieza]], the emperor of the Universe and overseer of the Saiyans. Bardock dismisses the visions and goes to join his team on Planet Meat, only to discover most of them dead, and his best friend Tora<!-- The name \"Tora\" is used only in the English dub. The pun is on \"tomato\".--> mortally wounded. Before he succumbs to his injuries, Tora reveals that Bardock's squad was betrayed and killed by Frieza's henchman [[Dodoria]] and his elite soldiers, and that Frieza ordered the attack on the crew due to him becoming paranoid about the growing power of the Saiyans. Horrified and enraged by his fallen friend's last words, he then battles Dodoria's soldiers and defeats them all, only to be easily overwhelmed by a single mouth blast from Dodoria. He is left severely injured, but manages to return to Planet Vegeta.\n\nNow realizing that Frieza intends to [[Genocide|destroy the entire Saiyan race]], Bardock attempts to convince the other Saiyans of the danger that they are all in, but his claims are laughed off and ignored. Bardock thus begins a final one-man assault against Frieza and his men. After fighting his way through Frieza's soldiers, Bardock sends a large energy blast at the tyrant himself. However, Frieza counters this with his deadly ''Gigantic Death Ball'', killing Bardock, many of his own soldiers, and destroys Planet Vegeta. As he perishes, Bardock has one final vision of the future: Kakarot facing off against Frieza. Assured that Kakarot will be the one to defeat Frieza, Bardock smiles as he along with Planet Vegeta are engulfed by the energy bomb. After his demise, Bardock [[telepathically]] wishes Kakarot to carry out his will and avenge his people and their home planet, also stating his one regret of not holding his child when he still had the chance. At the same moment, Kakarot, who is hurdling toward Earth in his space pod, wakes up. Elsewhere, having just completed an assignment on a faraway world, [[Vegeta]], the Saiyan Prince, is informed by his colleague [[Nappa (Dragon Ball)|Nappa]] of his homeworld's destruction, and that Frieza claims that the planet was destroyed by a [[meteor]]. Vegeta's pride keeps him from expressing his shock, and he remains outwardly emotionless. Soon afterwards, Kakarot's space pod touches down on Earth, where he is found by an elderly man, [[Grandpa Gohan|Gohan]] and giggles happily in the old man's arms. Gohan then decides to adopt the boy as his own grandson, and gives him a new name \u2013 Goku.\n\nDuring the [[ending credits]], Goku's battles against the Red Ribbon Army, [[Tien Shinhan]], [[King Piccolo]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], Nappa and Vegeta are shown, culminating with an image of Goku about to battle Frieza, with the spirits of Bardock and his team watching.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese voice actor\n! colspan=\"2\" |English voice actor\n|-\n! <small>([[Funimation]], 2000 - original/2008 - remastered)</small>\n! <small>([[AB Groupe|AB Group]], {{circa|2003}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title=Dragon Ball Z: Big Green Dub Cast|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Bardock]] \n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]] || [[Sonny Strait]] || [[David Gasman]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku|Goku/Kakarot]] \n| [[Stephanie Nadolny]] (baby)<hr>[[Sean Schemmel]] (adult) || Jodi Forrest (baby)<hr>[[David Gasman]] (adult)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | {{Nihongo foot|Toma|\u30c8\u30fc\u30de|T\u014dma}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Kazuyuki Sogabe]]\n!Tora\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Doug Rand\n|-\n| [[Mike McFarland]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | {{Nihongo foot|Selypa|\u30bb\u30ea\u30d1|Seripa}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Y\u016bko Mita]]\n!Fasha\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Jodi Forrest\n|-\n| [[Linda Young]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | {{Nihongo foot|Totapo|\u30c8\u30c6\u30c3\u30dd|Toteppo}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[K\u014dz\u014d Shioya]]\n!Borgos\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Ed Marcus\n|-\n| [[Dameon Clarke]] \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | {{Nihongo foot|Pumbukin|\u30d1\u30f3\u30d6\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3|Panb\u016bkin}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Takeshi Watabe]]\n!Shugesh\n|-\n| [[Chris Rager]] \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Frieza]] \n| [[Ry\u016bsei Nakao]] || [[Linda Young]] \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Zarbon and Dodoria|Dodoria]] \n| [[Yukitoshi Hori]] || [[Chris Forbis]] \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Zarbon and Dodoria|Zarbon]] \n| [[Show Hayami|Sh\u014d Hayami]] || rowspan=\"2\" | [[Christopher R.
