The film was based on [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe\u2019s]] [[The Butcher Boy (novel)|1992 novel of the same name]] and McCabe co-wrote the screenplay with Jordan.<ref name=\"mov\">{{cite magazine | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition |magazine=[[Moving Pictures (magazine)|Moving Pictures]], Berlinale Extra | pages =14\u201316 | location = Berlin | date = 11\u201322 February 1998 | issn = 0959-6992 }}</ref>\n\nSet in the early 1960s, ''The Butcher Boy'' is about Francie Brady ([[Eamonn Owens]]), a 12-year-old boy who retreats into a violent fantasy world to escape the reality of his dysfunctional family; as his circumstances worsen, his sanity deteriorates and he begins acting out, with increasing brutality. The film won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[48th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1998 and a Special Mention for Owens \"astonishing lead\". It also won the [[European Film Award]] for Best Cinematographer for [[Adrian Biddle]].\n\n''The Butcher Boy'' was also the final film produced by [[The Geffen Film Company]], and was released before their closure in 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in Ireland in the early 1960s in the small town of [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]]. Francie Brady is a 12-year-old boy whose imagination is fuelled by [[television]] - [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[Communism|communists]], the [[Atomic Age]].<ref name=industry>{{cite web | last = Byrne | first = Paul | title = Neil Jordan (The Butcher Boy): The Provocative Son | publisher = industrycentral.net | date = 7 December 1999 | url = http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/NJ01.HTM | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}</ref> When his mother suffers a [[nervous breakdown]] and ultimately commits suicide, he is left in the care of his father, an emotionally distant and ill-tempered [[alcoholic]]. Francie spends most of his time with his best friend Joe Purcell talking about \"gangsters, cowboys and Indians, [[Comic book|comic-book]] monsters and the early-1960s threat of [[Doomsday device|nuclear annihilation]].\"<ref name=salon>{{cite web | last = O'Hehir | first = Andrew | title = The Butcher Boy | publisher = Salon Entertainment | date = 10 April 1998 | url = https://www.salon.com/1998/04/10/butcher/ | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}</ref> However, when Francie's growing conflict with another boy, Phillip Nugent, and his mother begins to go too far, he ends up at [[reform school]]. Here, he is [[child molestation|molested]] by Father Sullivan, and finds solace only in his fantasies about a foul-mouthed [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]. He returns home to find Joe has outgrown him and befriended Phillip Nugent. Before long, his father has drunk himself to death. Faced with being left completely alone in the world, Francie loses his grip on reality and lashes out with uncontrollable brutality, which shocks his provincial hometown.<ref name=\"mov\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eamonn Owens]] as Francie Brady\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Benny Brady (Da) / Adult Francie (uncredited)\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Mrs. Nugent\n* Andrew Fullerton as Phillip Nugent\n* [[Aisling O'Sullivan]] as Annie Brady (Ma)\n* Alan Boyle as Joe Purcell\n* [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] as Sergeant\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Uncle Alo\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Father Bubbles\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Father Sullivan\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] / Colleen\n* [[Gina Moxley]] as Mary\n* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as Doctor Boyd\n* [[Niall Buggy]] as Father Dom\n\n==Production==\nThe screen rights to the book were bought by [[Neil Jordan]] in 1992 during the filming of ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]''.<ref name=industry/> The [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] is mostly faithful to the novel, but there are some differences, the principal change being the ending. In the book, Francie is not seen to leave prison, and attempts to forge a friendship with an inmate similar to the one he had with Joe. In the film, a much older Francie is released from prison at the end to be brought to a [[halfway house]]. He picks a [[snowdrop]], echoing the opening of the film.\n\n[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting]] the child to play Francie was difficult. With no previous filming experiences, Eamonn Owens and Alan Boyle (who played Francie's best friend, Joe) were found at the local school in [[Killeshandra]] in [[County Cavan]] where casting assistant Maureen Hughes went to visit her uncle. Owens' younger brother Ciaran was also cast. Jordan cast O'Connor because \"she looks like the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].\"<ref name=industry/>\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]'s accomplishment with ''[[The Butcher Boy (novel)|The Butcher Boy]]'' was deemed unattainable in a film.<ref name=industry/><ref name=salon/> During the [[screenwriting]] process, McCabe wrote two drafts that digressed from the original novel, like \"planets within planets within planets\" according to Jordan, consequently, Jordan wrote the third draft that was more faithful to the novel.<ref name=industry/> Jordan cast McCabe in the role of town drunk Jimmy the Skite.<ref>{{cite news|last=McKella|first=Barbara|title=Neil Jordan ponders The Butcher Boy|url=https://barbaramackellar.wordpress.com/2012/05/28/neil-jordan-ponders-the-butcher-boy|work=Celtic Curmudgeon Arts & Entertainment Review|accessdate=20 September 2016|date=1998}}</ref>\n\nJordan captures Francie's mental illness by using [[voice-over]]s where the adult narrator Francie speaks with the child Francie. Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment criticizes Jordan and McCabe for an occasional \"flavor of an after-school special purveying [[didactic]] lessons about [[physical abuse|abuse]] and victimization,\" and losing \"the novel's [[Samuel Beckett|Beckettian]] ambiguity.\" However, he argues that Jordan \"brings a tenderness and sweetness\" to the otherwise unforgiving [[wikt:subject-matter|subject matter]].<ref name=salon/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe reception of the film has been generally positive. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] shows a 77% rating based on 61 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10.<ref name=rotten/> Andrew O'Hehir at Salon Entertainment says \"Neil Jordan's sweetly [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] movie\" has \"elaborate [[fantasy]] sequences [that] feel like irrelevant amusements.\" He also praises the film as \"a compelling exploration of the permeable border between normal childhood and full-on [[insanity]].\"<ref name=salon/>\nJeffrey M.
