The film, conceived and co-written by [[Ryne Douglas Pearson]], was originally attached to a number of directors under [[Columbia Pictures]], but it was placed in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] and eventually picked up by [[Escape Artists]]. Production was financially backed by [[Summit Entertainment]]. ''Knowing'' was filmed in [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]], [[Australia]], using various locations to represent the film's [[Boston]]-area setting. The film centers on the discovery of a strange paper filled with numbers and the possibility that they somehow predict the details of various disasters culminating in the [[apocalypse]].\n\nThe film was released on March 20, 2009, in the United States. The DVD and [[Blu-ray]] media were released on July 7, 2009. ''Knowing'' grossed $186.5 million at the worldwide box office, plus $27.7 million with home video sales, against an average production budget of $50 million. It met with mixed reviews, with praise for the acting performances, visual style and atmosphere, but criticism over some implausibilities and the ending.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1959, a [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] elementary school celebrates its opening with a competition in which students draw what they believe will happen in the future. All the children create visual works except for Lucinda Embry. Guided by whispering voices, she fills her paper with a series of numbers. Before she can write the final numbers, the allotted time for the task expires, and the teacher collects the students' drawings. The following day, Lucinda engraves the remaining numbers into a closet door with her fingernails. The works are stored in a [[time capsule]] and opened fifty years later when the current class distributes the drawings among the students. Lucinda's sheet is given to Caleb Koestler, the nine-year-old son of widowed [[MIT]] [[astrophysics]] professor John Koestler.\n\nJohn notices that Lucinda's numbers are dates, death tolls, and geographical coordinates of major catastrophes over the past fifty years (including the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the [[September 11 attacks]], and [[Hurricane Katrina]]), and three have yet to happen. In the following days, John encounters two of the three final events in person: a plane crash and a [[New York City Subway]] train collision caused by faulty [[Siding (railroad)|siding]]. John becomes convinced that his family has a significant role in these incidents: his wife died in one of the earlier events, while Caleb was the one to receive Lucinda's message. Meanwhile, Caleb begins hearing the same whispering voices as Lucinda.\n\nJohn tracks Lucinda's daughter Diana and her granddaughter Abby to prevent the last event. After some initial disbelief, Diana goes with John to Lucinda's childhood home, where they find a copy of [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]'s engraving of [[Merkabah mysticism|Ezekiel's \"chariot vision\"]], in which a great sun is represented. They also discover that the final two digits of Lucinda's message are not numbers, but two reversed letter E's, matching the message left by Lucinda under her bed: \"Everyone Else.\" During this search, Caleb and Abby, who were left asleep in the car, have an encounter with the beings who are the source of the whispers. Diana tells John that her mother had always told her the date she would die. He also visits Lucinda's teacher, who tells him of the scratching on the door left by Lucinda.\n\n[[File:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|thumb|250px|A copy of [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]'s engraving of [[Merkabah mysticism|Ezekiel's \"chariot vision\"]] (1670), which the film's protagonists interpret as an announcement of the end of the world.]]\nThe next day, Abby colors in the sun on the engraving, which gives John a revelation. He rushes to the [[Haystack Observatory|MIT observatory]] and learns that a [[Superflare|massive solar flare]] with the potential to destroy all life will hit the Earth on the last date indicated by the message. As Diana and Abby prepare to take refuge in nearby caves, John goes to the school and finds the door on which Lucinda engraved the final numbers and identifies them as coordinates of a place where he believes they may find salvation from the solar flare. The skeptical and hysterical Diana loads Caleb and Abby into her car and flees for the caves.\n\nAt a [[gas station]], the whispering beings steal her car with Caleb and Abby inside. Diana pursues them at speed (in a stolen [[SUV]]) but is killed in a [[traffic accident]] involving a [[semi-truck]] on the date her mother predicted. The beings take Caleb and Abby to Lucinda's mobile home, where John encounters them shortly thereafter. The beings, acting as extraterrestrial angels, are leading children to safety on [[Starship|interstellar arks]]. John is told he cannot go with them because he never heard the whispering, so he convinces Caleb to leave with Abby and two pet rabbits they found, and both are transported away by the beings. The ark, along with many other arks, leave Earth. The following morning, John decides to be with his family when the flare strikes and drives through a chaotic [[Boston]] to his parent's house, where he reconciles with his estranged father. The solar flare then strikes, destroying the Earth's atmosphere and all life on the planet. Meanwhile, the ark, along with others, deposits Caleb and Abby in another world resembling an [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]] and departs. The two run through a field towards a large white mysterious tree (implied to be the [[tree of life]]).\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as John Koestler\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Diana \n* [[Chandler Canterbury]] as Caleb Koestler\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Phil Beckman \n* [[Lara Robinson]] as Abby / Lucinda\n* D.G.

I wanted to make the movie credible.

He writes, \"Cage plays an astronomer, and his discussions with a colleague hint that the film may actually grapple with the question of predicting the future, perhaps even offer a plausible theory. Unfortunately, this approach is abandoned as Koestler pursues the disasters, and the film eventually moves into a mystical approach\".<ref>Steve Biodrowski [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2009/03/knowing-science-fiction-film-review/ Knowing - Science Fiction Film Review] Cinefantastique, Retrieved January 5, 2012</ref>\n\nAsked about his research for the role, Nicolas Cage stated: \"I grew up with a professor, so that was all the research I ever needed\".
