''Charley Varrick'' was based on the novel ''The Looters'' by [[John H. Reese]] and is the first of four consecutive films Matthau appeared in that were not comedies.\n\n==Plot==\nCharley Varrick is a [[Aerial application|crop-duster]] and former stunt pilot. Charley, his wife Nadine, longtime accomplice Al Dutcher, and youngster Harman Sullivan, rob a bank in the rural community of Tres Cruces, New Mexico. While Nadine waits in the getaway car, the heavily disguised Charley and his two accomplices draw their guns and begin the heist. A police officer passing by recognizes the getaway car. When the officers approach Nadine, she shoots at them, killing one instantly and seriously wounding the other, but the second officer returns fire, wounding her. The melee outside distracts the robbers, enabling the bank guard to kill Dutcher. Sensing that the bank manager is concealing something, Charley forces him to reveal two large satchels of cash. Charley, Harman, and Nadine flee, but Nadine dies soon thereafter. Charley and Harman swap vehicles and prepare to blow up the getaway car, with Nadine's body inside. They are stopped by another police officer, but before he can search their van, the explosion goes off and the officer races away.\n\nWhen they count the money, it totals $765,118&nbsp;\u2014 much more than expected. After a local news broadcast reports that only $2,000 was stolen, Charley says the bank must be involved in a money-laundering operation. He warns Harman that the Mafia will pursue them relentlessly and that their only chance of surviving is by laying low and not spending the money for three or four years; however, Harman insists that he should be free to spend his share on women and good times. Meanwhile, Maynard Boyle, president of the bank, dispatches tall, burly, and sadistic hit man Molly to recover the money.\n\nRealizing that Harman's rashness will get them both killed, Charley double-crosses him. Charley knows that he, Nadine, and Harman all had dental work done recently, so he breaks into the dentist's office, stealing his and Nadine's X-rays and swapping Harman's for his. To obtain passports, Charley contacts Tom, an old accomplice of Dutcher, who directs him to local photographer Jewell Everett. He has his photograph taken, but he also gives her Harman's driver's license, thereby ensuring that Molly will find Harman. Tom immediately informs on Charley. Jewell also betrays Charley, but he never returns for the passports. Molly arrives at Charley's trailer and tortures Harman to get information about the money, then beats Harman to death.\n\nBoyle meets secretly with Tres Cruces bank manager Harold Young, advising Young that his Mafia superiors will suspect that the robbery was an inside job, because it occurred during the brief period when the money was there. He suggests that Young will be tortured. Young, terrified, commits suicide.\n\nCharley purchases dynamite, then flies to Reno, where he has flowers delivered to Boyle's secretary, Sybil Fort, so he can identify her and follow her home. He seduces Fort in her apartment. Fort warns Charley not to trust her boss.\n\nCharley then contacts Boyle, offering to return the money. He arranges a meeting at a remote automobile wrecking yard and insists that Boyle come alone. Charley overflies the wrecking yard and spots Molly's car. After landing, Charley hugs the confounded Boyle, acting overjoyed; Molly falls for the ruse and assumes that Boyle is Charley's accomplice, so he runs Boyle down with his car, killing him. Molly then chases Charley, who tries to fly away, but Molly damages the crop-duster's tail with his car and the aircraft flips over. Trapped in the wreckage, Charley tells Molly that the money is in the trunk of a nearby car. However, Charley had flipped his aircraft on purpose. When Molly opens the trunk, he sees Harman's body, wearing Charley's wedding band, and the bank satchels; an instant later, he is killed by a booby trap. Charley throws a wad of hundred-dollar bills toward the burning car, then, after a couple of false starts, drives away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Charley Varrick\n* [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andy Robinson]] as Harman Sullivan\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Molly\n* [[John Vernon]] as Maynard Boyle\n* [[Sheree North]] as Jewell Everett\n* [[Felicia Farr]] as Sybil Fort\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Garfinkle\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Harold Young\n* [[William Schallert]] as Sheriff Horton\n* [[Jacqueline Scott]] as Nadine\n* [[Benson Fong]] as Honest John\n* [[Marjorie Bennett]] as Mrs. Taft\n* [[Tom Tully]] as Tom\n* [[Kathleen O'Malley]] as Jessie\n* [[Albert Popwell]] as Randolph Percy\n* [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]] as Bank Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Don Siegel]] as Murphy \n* [[Joseph Conforte|Joe Conforte]] as himself\n* [[James Nolan (actor)|James Nolan]] as Clerk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector Don Siegel wanted Varrick's company's motto, \"Last of the Independents\", to be the title of the film. The motto appears on the film poster and briefly as a subtitle in the [[Trailer (promotion)|film trailer]].\n\nWhen the hit man Molly arrives at Jewell's photo studio and introduces himself, Jewell sarcastically replies, \"Yeah, I didn't figure you for Clint Eastwood\". The role of Varrick was written for Eastwood, who turned it down, reportedly because he could not find any redeeming features in the character. Matthau was also reported to have been unimpressed by the film, and Siegel later claimed that Matthau hurt the film's box-office by publicly stating that he neither liked the film nor understood what it was about. Matthau sent Siegel a note that said, \"I have seen it three times, and am of slightly better than average intelligence (IQ 120) but I still don't quite understand what's going on. Is there a device we can use to explain to people what they're seeing?\"<ref>George Anastasia & Glen Macnow, ''The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies'' (Running Press, 2011), Chapter 78</ref>\n\nVarrick's aircraft is a converted [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Boeing PT-17 Stearman Kaydet]] (N53039) crop-duster flown by Hollywood aerial pilot [[Frank Tallman]]. The modified crop-duster belonged to a California agricultural spraying business. This same aircraft crashed in Oakdale, California on December 31, 1976, killing the pilot, who was crop dusting. The plane's wing caught an electric wire and crashed.<ref>Santoir, Christian. [http://www.aeromovies.fr/articles.php?lng=fr&pg=2570 \"Charley Varrick\".] ''Aeromovies''.

(1982 film)|Jinxed!]]'' ''Charley Varrick'' was set in [[New Mexico]], but was filmed primarily in two small [[Nevada]] towns, [[Dayton, Nevada|Dayton]] and [[Genoa, Nevada|Genoa]]. Both towns lay a claim to being the oldest towns in the state. The opening bank robbery exterior scenes were filmed in Genoa, at the old Douglas County court house. The sheriff's chase of Varrick and his gang was filmed nearby on Genoa Lane, and on [[Nevada State Route 207]].\n\nThe interior bank scenes were filmed in [[Minden, Nevada|Minden]]. The trailer park scenes were filmed in Dayton by Hwy 50, at the trailer park, located near the Red Hawk Casino, which was closed in 2008, and the Carson River, at the corner of Hart and Louie Streets. The photographer's studio and gun store scenes were filmed in [[Gardnerville, Nevada|Gardnerville]]. The crop duster flight scenes at the conclusion were filmed at the now-closed City Auto Wrecking east of [[Sparks, Nevada|Sparks]], near Lockwood Nevada, by Canyon Way Road. The Reno, Nevada filming locations included the Chinese restaurant scenes, filmed at 538 South Virginia Street, and the [[Arlington Towers]] condominium building at 100 N. Arlington Avenue. This condo tower is where Varrick meets Miss Fort.<ref name=\"Locations\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069865/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt \"Locations: 'Charley Varrick' (1973).\"] ''IMDb''.

Intelligence in this case has nothing to do with being literate, poetic, or even reasonable. It has to do with movement, suspense, and sudden changes in fortune that are plausible enough to entertain without challenging you to question basic premises. If you start asking whether such-and-such could really have happened, or if so-and-so would have acted in a certain way, the action film falls apart.<ref>Canby, Vincent.
