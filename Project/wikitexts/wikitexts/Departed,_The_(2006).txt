Wikipedia synopsis should be simple and to the point.--->\nIn [[South Boston]], Colin Sullivan is introduced to [[Irish Mob]] boss Frank Costello. Twenty years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a [[Espionage|spy]] inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP) and joins the Special Investigations Unit, led by Captain Ellerby. Another recruit, State Trooper Billy Costigan Jr., is approached by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's crew. They set up a cover: Costigan serves time in jail on a phony charge and eventually joins Costello's crew. Ellerby informs Special Investigations that only Queenan and Dignam will know their undercovers' names and that Costello's crew has stolen computer microprocessors to sell to a Hong Kong [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]]. Due to being undercover, Costigan's emotional state declines, but Queenan and Dignam plead with him to keep his cover.\n\nSullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Dr. Madolyn Madden. The MSP prepares to catch Costello selling the microprocessors; however, Sullivan tips off Costello about the police presence causing the deal to occur off-camera, allowing everyone to escape. Costello realizes there is a spy in his crew and tasks Sullivan to uncover his identity. Sullivan asks Costello for information to cross-reference his crew members in the MSP database. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant, and Costello accuses Costigan of being the spy within his crew, which he denies. Costigan shares his discovery with Queenan and warns that Costello is aware of a spy within his crew, and tells Dignam that there's spy in the MSP. Other than Queenan and Dignam, Costigan\u2019s only contact in the MSP is Madolyn Madden, Sullivan\u2019s girlfriend, with whom he later has an affair.\n\nCostigan follows Costello into a theater and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope. Queenan instructs Costigan to get a visual ID of Sullivan before making the arrest but Costigan is unable to get a good look at Sullivan's face; when Sullivan realizes that he is being followed he attempts to hide and stab Costigan as he walks by but mistakenly kills a restaurant worker and flees the scene. Sullivan then tries to cross-reference Costigan\u2019s picture, captured by nearby security footage, against police officer databases but cannot recognize him. Queenan advises Sullivan to follow Costello to find the MSP mole. Costigan calls Queenan and sets up a meeting but Sullivan has Queenan tailed by another officer by lying to the officer about Queenan being the possible spy. Sullivan uses the tail's information on their location to call in Costello's gang. \n\nWhen Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before confronting them and being thrown from the building's roof to his death. As a result of Queenan's murder, Sullivan is attacked by an enraged Dignam who is then suspended by Ellerby shortly after. Meanwhile, one of Costello's mortally wounded henchmen, Timothy Delahunt (who is later revealed to be another undercover cop working for the [[Boston Police Department|local department]]), explains to Costigan that he is aware of his infiltration but doesn't alert the crew; he then succumbs to his gunshot injury. Sullivan also learns that Costello is an [[FBI]] informant and decides to help the MSP catch him. Costello is tailed by the MSP to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant, and fatally shoots him.\n\nWhen Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, he notices the envelope Costello used to collect the gang's personal information to find the mole on Sullivan's desk and realizes that Sullivan is Costello's spy. Sullivan then erases Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan hands Madolyn, who has moved in with Sullivan, an envelope and instructs her to open it if something happens to him. Later, she reveals that she is pregnant to Sullivan, then opens a different letter containing tapes Costello made of himself with Sullivan, listens to them, and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop at the building where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, a friend from the [[police academy]], to substantiate his identity, but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth. \n\nCostigan says that he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan and Brown are killed by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's, who reveals himself to be another spy working for Costello. Sullivan then shoots Barrigan dead, allowing him to out Barrigan as the mole while removing suspicion from himself. When Sullivan arrives home after attending Costigan\u2019s funeral, Dignam (who Madolyn had presumably shown the incriminating tapes) is waiting for a now resigned to his fate when he sees him Sullivan - and Dignam shoots Sullivan in the head, avenging Queenan and Costigan's deaths.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Trooper William \"Billy\" Costigan Jr.\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Staff Sergeant Colin Sullivan\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Frank Costello\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Captain Oliver \"Charlie\" Queenan\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Arnold \"Frenchie\" French\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Dr. Madolyn Madden\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Captain George Ellerby\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Trooper Brown\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Sean Costigan\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Trooper Barrigan\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Patrick \"Fitzy\" Fitzgibbons\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Timothy Delahunt\n* [[Robert Wahlberg]] as FBI Special Agent Frank Lazio\n* [[Kristen Dalton (actress)|Kristen Dalton]] as Gwen\n* Amanda Lynch as Carmen\n* [[Shay Duffin]] as Phil\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Martin Scorsese (8250485096).jpg|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese in 2006, the director of the film]]\nIn January 2003, [[Warner Bros.]], producer [[Brad Grey]], and actor/producer [[Brad Pitt]] bought the rights to remake the Hong Kong film ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (2002) from [[Media Asia Entertainment Group|Media Asia]] for $1.75 million.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Zorianna |last1=Kit |first2=Chris |last2=Gardner |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-97614647/warners-pays-have-affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054104/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-97614647/warners-pays-have-affairs|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2013 |title=Warners pays to have ''Affairs'' |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=February 3, 2003 |access-date=November 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=filmmaker>{{cite web |first=Dade |last=Hayes |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/news/brad-pitt-s-role-as-filmmaker-threatens-to-eclipse-his-actorly-exploits-and-tabloid-profile-1117955806/ |title=Brad Pitt's role as filmmaker threatens to eclipse his actorly exploits and tabloid profile |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=December 14, 2006 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184416/https://variety.com/2006/film/news/brad-pitt-s-role-as-filmmaker-threatens-to-eclipse-his-actorly-exploits-and-tabloid-profile-1117955806/|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[William Monahan]] was secured as a screenwriter, and later [[Martin Scorsese]], who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director.<ref name=filmmaker /><ref name=directors /><ref name=pitt>{{cite magazine |first=Elvis |last=Mitchell |author-link=Elvis Mitchell |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/brad-pitt |title=Brad Pitt's Great Escape |magazine=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |publisher=Crystal Ball Media |location=New York City |date=February 2007 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108190212/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/brad-pitt|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2004, [[United Press International]] announced that Scorsese would be remaking ''Infernal Affairs'' and setting it in Boston, and that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star.<ref name=upi>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2004/03/02/Leo-DiCaprio-Brad-Pitt-lead-Affairs/UPI-62891078255749/ |title=Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt lead ''Affairs'' |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=March 2, 2004 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107015320/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2004/03/02/Leo-DiCaprio-Brad-Pitt-lead-Affairs/UPI-62891078255749/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead.<ref name=pitt /> Scorsese's associate [[Kenneth Lonergan]] suggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello.<ref name=directors />\n\nNicholson wanted the film to have \"something a little more\" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangster [[Whitey Bulger]].
