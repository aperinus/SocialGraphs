The film stars [[Valeria Golino]], [[Vincenzo Amato]], and [[Francesco Casisa]]. In the [[Italian language]], ''[[:wiktionary:Respiro|respiro]]'' means ''breath''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nGrazia, played by Golino, is a free-spirited mother of three married to shy fisherman Pietro (Vincenzo Amato) and living on the idyllic but isolated island of [[Lampedusa]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. She shows signs of [[Bipolar Disorder|manic depressive]] behaviour\u2014one moment she is laughing wildly and swimming half-naked in the sea, while the next she is curled in a ball on her bed. Out of her earshot, the adult members of her extended family vaguely discuss sending her to a facility of some sort in Northern [[Italy]].\n\nGrazia is closely shepherded by her oldest son Pasquale, played by Casisa. After Pietro puts down one of Grazia's dogs because he thinks it might be dangerous, impulsive Grazia sets all the stray dogs free in the town's makeshift kennel. After the dogs swarm over the island, the locals demand that Pietro do something about his wife. But when he tells her he plans to send her away to Northern Italy, she runs away and hides in a cave on the shore, where she is secretly tended by Pasquale, who brings her food every day.\n\nPietro and some friends doggedly search the island for Grazia, so Pasquale leaves one of her dresses by the edge of the sea as a ruse. Pietro finds the dress\u2014the one she was wearing the day she disappeared\u2014and nearly everyone presumes she has drowned. Pietro, however, continues to search for her, and just before an important local religious festival, he sees her swimming in the water. He dives in to assist her, thinking a miracle has occurred, and many of the villagers follow suit, thus providing a sheltering circle around her as she is brought safely to shore.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nWriter/director Crialese won the Critics Week Grand Prize and the Young Critics Award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The film was also nominated for the Best European Union Film at the [[C\u00e9sar Awards]] and received other nominations and awards in various European award competitions.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nArtist [[John Surman]] wrote the original score featuring sequenced synthesizer and alto saxophone. There was no soundtrack CD released, however part of the score can be found on his 1981 album ''The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon''. The track is called \"Part 1 - Nestor's Saga (The Tale of The Ancient)\". The soundtrack also featured \"[[La bambola|La Bambola]]\" performed by the Italian artist [[Patty Pravo]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe English-language reviews for ''Respiro'' were generally positive. Steven Holden wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"not since ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'' has a movie so palpably captured the down-to-earth, flesh-and-blood reality of high-spirited people living their lives without self-consciousness.\" Writing for ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine, critic Peter Debruge noted, \"in the annals of Mediterranean island love stories, Respiro reflects the effortless charm of a film like ''[[Il Postino]]''.\"\n\nCritic [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', however, felt \"its long-winded denouement, in which Grazia runs away rather than be sent to an institution, doesn't bring the story full circle. It just extends it.\"\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0286516}}\n*{{Metacritic film}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|respiro}}\n*[http://www.washdiplomat.com/03-07/bC_03_07.html Magazine article about the making of ''Respiro'']\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:Italian independent films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Sicily]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Sicilian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Mediterranean Sea]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]"}]}}}}
