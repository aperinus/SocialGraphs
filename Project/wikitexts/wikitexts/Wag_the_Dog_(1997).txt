The screenplay by [[Hilary Henkin]] and [[David Mamet]] was loosely adapted from [[Larry Beinhart]]'s 1993 novel, ''[[American Hero (novel)|American Hero]]''.\n\n''Wag the Dog'' was released one month before the outbreak of the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal]] and the [[Operation Infinite Reach|subsequent bombing]] of the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in Sudan by the [[Clinton administration]] in August 1998, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality.<ref>{{cite news | title=Wag the Dog Back In Spotlight | url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-08-21/politics/wag.the.dog_1_people-from-terrorist-activities-dogs-military-strikes?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS | work=CNN | date=August 20, 1998 | access-date=May 23, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915020805/http://articles.cnn.com/1998-08-21/politics/wag.the.dog_1_people-from-terrorist-activities-dogs-military-strikes?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS# | archive-date=September 15, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The comparison was also made in December 1998 when the administration initiated a [[Operation Desert Fox|bombing campaign of Iraq]] during Clinton's [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] trial over the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal.<ref>{{cite news | title=Cohen criticizes 'wag the dog' characterization | url=https://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/23/wag.dog/ | work=CNN | date=March 23, 2004 | access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> It was made again in the spring of 1999 when the administration intervened in the [[Kosovo War]] and initiated a [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]] against [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]], which coincidentally bordered Albania and contained ethnic Albanians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Reed |first1=Julia |title=Welcome to Wag the Dog Three |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/welcome-to-wag-the-dog-three-1086640.html |work=The Independent |date=April 11, 1999}}</ref> The film grossed $64.3 million on a $15 million budget and was well received by critics, who praised the direction, performances, themes, and humor. Hoffman received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and screenwriters [[David Mamet]] and [[Hilary Henkin]] were both nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe president is caught making advances on an underage girl inside the [[Oval Office]], less than two weeks before the election. Conrad Brean, a top [[spin doctor]], is brought in by presidential aide Winifred Ames to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a fleeing orphan to arouse sympathy. The hoax is initially successful, with the president quickly gaining ground in the polls.\n\nWhen the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his and the CIA's best interests. But when the CIA \u2014 in collusion with the president's rival candidate \u2014 reports that the war has ended, the media begins to focus back on the president's sexual abuse scandal. To counter this, Motss invents a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania. Inspired by the idea that he was \"discarded like an old shoe\", Brean and Motss ask the Pentagon to provide a special forces soldier with a matching name (a sergeant named \"Schumann\" is identified) around whom a POW narrative can be constructed. As part of the hoax, folk singer Johnny Dean records a song called \"Old Shoe\", which is pressed onto a [[78 rpm]] record, prematurely aged so that listeners will think it was recorded years earlier, and sent to the [[Library of Congress]] to be \"found\".  Soon, large numbers of old pairs of shoes began appearing on phone and power lines, and a grassroots movement takes hold.\n\nWhen the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally-insane Army convict. On the way back, their plane crashes en route to [[Andrews Air Force Base]]. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, an illegal alien who is given expedited citizenship for a better story. However, Schumann is killed after he attempts to rape a gas station owner's daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming that he died from wounds sustained during his rescue.\n\nWhile watching a political talk show, Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the president's upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of \"Don't change horses in mid-stream\" rather than to Motss's hard work. Motss states that he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Brean's offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is \"playing with his life\". After Motss refuses to change his mind, Brean reluctantly orders his security staff to kill him. A newscast reports that Motss has died of a heart attack at home, the president was successfully re-elected, and an Albanian terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for a recent bombing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Conrad Brean \n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Stanley Motss\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Winifred Ames\n* [[Denis Leary]] as 'Fad King'\n* [[Willie Nelson]] as Johnny Dean\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Liz Butsky\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Tracy Lime\n* [[William H.

Similarities have been noted between the character and Evans' work habits, mannerisms, quirks, clothing style, hairstyle, and large, square-framed eyeglasses; in fact, the real Evans is said to have joked, \"I'm magnificent in this film.\"<ref name=\"Nwk\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-04-05/news/9804040759_1_tiger-mcmillan-bodyguard|title=Tiger Plays It Cool Under Big-cat Pressure| date=April 5, 1998|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=April 5, 2013}}</ref> Hoffman has never discussed any inspiration Evans may have provided for the role, and claims on the [[commentary track]] for the film's DVD release that much of Motss' characterization was based on Hoffman's father, Harry Hoffman, a former [[theatrical property|prop]] manager for [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n===Writing credits===\nThe award of writing credits on the film became controversial at the time, due to objections by Barry Levinson. After Levinson became attached as director, David Mamet was hired to rewrite [[Hilary Henkin]]'s screenplay, which was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart's novel ''American Hero''.\n\nGiven the close relationship between Levinson and Mamet, [[New Line Cinema]] asked that Mamet be given sole credit for the screenplay. However, the [[Writers Guild of America]] intervened on Henkin's behalf to ensure that Henkin received first-position shared screenplay credit, finding that\u2014as the original screenwriter\u2014Henkin had created the screenplay's structure as well as much of the screen story and dialogue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-may-11-mn-48618-story.html |title=Giving Credit Where It's Due - Los Angeles Times|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=May 11, 1998|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=November 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nLevinson thereafter threatened to (but did not) quit the Guild, claiming that Mamet had written all of the dialogue as well as creating the characters of Motss and Schumann, and had originated most of the scenes set in Hollywood and all of the scenes set in Nashville. Levinson attributed the numerous similarities between Henkin's original version and the eventual shooting script to Henkin and Mamet working from the same novel, but the WGA disagreed in its credit arbitration ruling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/35690/woof-and-warp-of-dog-screen-credit |first=Bridget |last=Byrne |title=Woof and Warp of \"Dog\" Screen Credit |publisher=E!

However, none of these pieces made it onto the soundtrack CD. The CD featured only the title track (by British guitarist/vocalist [[Mark Knopfler]]) and seven of Knopfler's [[instrumental]]s.\n\n===Songs as listed in the film's credits===\n* \"[[Thank Heaven for Little Girls]]\": written by [[Lerner and Lowe]], performed by [[Maurice Chevalier]]\n* \"I Guard the Canadian Border\": written by [[Tom B\u00e4hler]] and [[Willie Nelson]], performed by Nelson\n* \"The American Dream\": written by B\u00e4hler, performed by B\u00e4hler\n* \"Good Old Shoe\": written by [[Edgar Winter]], performed by Nelson and [[Pops Staples]]\n* \"Classical Allegro\": written by [[Marc Ferrari]] and Nancy Hieronymous\n* \"Courage Mom\": written by [[Merle Haggard]] and performed by Merle Haggard and [[The Strangers (American band)|the Strangers]]\n* \"[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]\": written by [[Heart (band)|Heart]], referenced by [[Woody Harrelson]] in character\n* \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\": written by [[Alicia Bridges]] and Susan Hutcheson\n* \"God Bless the Men of the 303\": written by [[Huey Lewis]], performed by Lewis, [[Scott Mathews]], and [[Johnny Colla]]\n* \"Wag the Dog\": written and performed by Mark Knopfler\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Wag the Dog'' has an approval rating of 86% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

The idiom stems from the 1870s.
