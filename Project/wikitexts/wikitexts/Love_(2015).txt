It had its premiere at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in [[3D film|3D]]. The film is notable for its [[unsimulated sex]] scenes.\n\n==Plot==\nMurphy ([[Karl Glusman]]) is an American [[film studies|film]] student living in [[Paris]]. On a rainy January morning, he receives a call at the small apartment he shares with Danish partner Omi (Klara Kristin) and their 18-month-old son, Gaspar. The surprise visitor is Nora, the mother of his ex-girlfriend Electra ([[Aomi Muyock]]), who asks if Murphy knows of her daughter's whereabouts. She hasn't heard from Electra in three months, and is worried, given her issues with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and previous [[suicide]] attempts.\n\nFor the rest of this day, Murphy recalls his relationship with Electra in a series of fragmented, nonlinear flashbacks. They depict their first meeting; their quick hook-up; and their lives over the next two years, which are filled with [[drug abuse]], rough sex, and tender moments. Murphy and Electra eventually met and had a [[Casual sex|no-strings-attached]] [[group sex|threesome]] with Omi, then a young teenager, as a way to add some excitement to their love life.\n\nHowever, Murphy continued his sexual relationship with Omi, without Electra's knowledge. This eventually resulted in an [[unplanned pregnancy]], due to a broken [[condom]]. Omi refused to terminate the pregnancy, as she was [[Anti-abortion movement|against abortion]]. Admitting the truth to Electra ultimately ended hers and Murphy's relationship, leading to the present-day set up of Murphy and Omi raising the child together. Electra's whereabouts and ultimate fate are left unresolved at the end of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Karl Glusman]] as Murphy\n* [[Aomi Muyock]] as Electra\n* Klara Kristin as Omi\n* Ugo Fox as Gaspar (the baby)\n* Juan Saavedra as Julio\n* [[Gaspar No\u00e9]] as No\u00e9\n* Isabelle Nicou as Nora\n* Vincent Maraval as Castel\n* Deborah Revy as Paula\n* Stella Rocha as Mama\n* Xamira Zuloaga as Lucile\n* [[Beno\u00eet Debie]] as Yuyo\n* Omaima S. as Victoire\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nInitially, No\u00e9 wanted the then married couple [[Monica Bellucci]] and [[Vincent Cassel]], to play the leads, but they took issue with the explicit, unsimulated sex.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barlow |first1=Helen |title=Director Gaspar No\u00e9 explains why real sex scenes were filmed for Love movie |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-20370409.html |access-date=11 July 2022 |work=Irish Examiner |publisher=Irish Examiner Ltd |date=9 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Love'' is the screen debut of the film's two main actresses, Muyock and Kristin.<ref>{{cite news|last=Webb|first=Beth|title=Revealed: the 3D sex odyssey set to scandalise Cannes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/love/gaspar-noe-3d-sex-cast-cannes/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=29 May 2015|date=20 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530082242/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/love/gaspar-noe-3d-sex-cast-cannes/|archive-date=30 May 2015}}</ref> No\u00e9 met them in a club.
