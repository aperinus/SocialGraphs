Simon]], and starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Woody Allen]]. The title is a play on [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Scenes from a Marriage]]'', and the film itself features similar themes of marital disintegration.<ref name=Varrev/>\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews, with critics focusing on the characters' arbitrary and unrealistic emotional reactions, the lack of successful humor, and the overdone production.\n\n==Plot==\nNick ([[Woody Allen]]), a sports lawyer, is married to psychotherapist and author Deborah ([[Bette Midler]]). After years of being happily married, Nick reveals to Deborah that he has had an affair. She is soon shocked and requests a divorce, but later admits that she herself has been unfaithful.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bette Midler]] &ndash; Deborah Fifer\n*[[Woody Allen]] &ndash; Nick Fifer\n*[[Bill Irwin]] &ndash; Mime\n*[[Daren Firestone]] &ndash; Sam\n*[[Rebecca Nickels]] &ndash; Jennifer\n*[[Paul Mazursky]] &ndash; Doctor Hans Clava\n*[[Marc Shaiman]] &ndash; Pianist\n*[[Joan Delaney]] &ndash; Woman interviewer\n*[[Fabio Lanzoni]] &ndash; Handsome Man\n*[[Dealin LaValley]] &ndash; Waiter\n\n==Production==\nMost of the mall scenes were filmed at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] sound stages in Queens, New York.<ref name=Varrev/> Mall scenes with elevators and escalators were filmed at the [[Stamford Town Center]] in Stamford, Connecticut.
