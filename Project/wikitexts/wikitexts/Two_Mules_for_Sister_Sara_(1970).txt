The film was to have been the first in a five-year exclusive association between [[Universal Pictures]] and Sanen Productions of Mexico.<ref>[http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_062369/11 Issuu \u2013 You Publish]</ref> It was the second of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, following ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968). The collaboration continued with ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (both 1971) and finally ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979).\n\nThe plot follows an American [[mercenary]] who gets mixed up with a [[nun]] and aids a group of [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez|Juarista]] rebels during the puppet reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] in Mexico.<ref>Frayling (1992), p. 7</ref><ref>Smith (1993), p. 76</ref> The film featured both American and Mexican actors and actresses, including being filmed in the picturesque countryside near [[Tlayacapan]], [[Morelos]]. [[Ennio Morricone]] composed the film's music.\n\n==Plot==\nJust after the [[American Civil War]], a former soldier named Hogan ([[Clint Eastwood]]) rides up on a naked woman about to be raped by bandits. He kills the bandits and discovers the woman is a nun, Sister Sara ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), who is raising money to assist Mexican revolutionaries fighting French occupying forces. When Sara requests that Hogan take her to the Mexican camp he agrees, as he had previously arranged to help the revolutionaries attack the French garrison, in exchange for half the garrison's treasury.\n\nAs the duo heads towards the camp, evading French troops all the while, Hogan is surprised that the nun swears and drinks whiskey. While on their way to destroy a French ammunition train, Hogan is shot at by [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] and seriously wounded with an arrow. Sara is able to tend to his wounds, and she is able to set the charges that Hogan detonates to destroy the train. Eventually the two reach Juarista commander Col. Beltran's camp. Sara begs the local villagers for money needed to purchase [[dynamite]] for the assault on the garrison. In the lead up to the attack Sara reveals to Hogan that she is not a nun, but a [[prostitute]] posing as a nun because she is wanted by the French for her support of the revolutionaries. Although Hogan is shocked, the two team up to infiltrate the fort and let a squad of revolutionaries in through a [[trapdoor]], while two other squads attack the gates and a fourth act as [[sharpshooter]]s.\n\nThey expected the French army to be drunk for Bastille day but the destruction of the train has put the garrison on high alert. Hogan and Sara infiltrate the fortress by Hogan posing as a bounty hunter who has captured Sara and is turning her in for the reward. The ruse works, Hogan and Sara engage the French commanding officers while the garrison's gates are breached for the Mexican revolutionary forces to swarm through. A battle ensues; the French are defeated, and the Mexicans capture the fort. As promised, Hogan receives half the riches. Now wealthy and with his job completed, Hogan sets off with Sara, with whom he has fallen in love, to open a gambling house in San Francisco.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Hogan\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Sara\n* [[Manuel F\u00e1bregas|Manolo F\u00e1bregas]] as Col.

Boetticher had planned the film for [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Deborah Kerr]], who had played a man of action and a nun in ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]''. Kerr's character was a member of the Mexican [[aristocracy]] escaping the vengeance of the [[Mexican Revolution]], with Mitchum's cowboy protecting her as he led her to safety to the United States.\n\nCarrol Case sold the screenplay to [[Martin Rackin]], who had [[Albert Maltz]], also living in Mexico, rewrite the story.<ref>Schickel (1996), p. 225</ref> Maltz's version had [[Clint Eastwood]] playing a [[Mercenary|soldier of fortune]] for the Juaristas and [[Shirley MacLaine]] playing a revolutionary prostitute<ref>[http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/06/38/boetticher.html Senses of Cinema, ''Ride Lonesome: The Career of Budd Boetticher''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003120648/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/06/38/boetticher.html |date=October 3, 2009}}</ref> now set during the [[French intervention in Mexico]]. The film saw Eastwood embody the tall mysterious stranger once more, unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest and smoking a cigar and the film score was composed by [[Ennio Morricone]].<ref>Schickel (1996), p.226</ref> Although the film had Leonesque dirty Hispanic villains, the film was considerably less crude and more sardonic than those of Leone.<ref name=\"McGilligan179\">McGilligan (1999), p. 179</ref>\n\nBoetticher expressed disgust that MacLaine's bawdy character obviously did not resemble a nun, as opposed to his idea of a genteel lady whose final revelation would have been more of a surprise to the audience.<ref>Davis, Ronald L. ''Just Making Movies'', [[University Press of Mississippi]], p. 219</ref> Though Boetticher was friends with both Eastwood and director [[Don Siegel]], Siegel understood Boetticher's dislike of the final film. Boetticher asked Siegel how he could make an awful film like that; Siegel replied that it was a great feeling to wake up in the morning and know there was a check in the mail, and Boetticher riposted that it was a better feeling to wake up in the morning and be able to look at yourself in the mirror.<ref>p. 56 Dixon, Wheeler K. ''Film Talk'' Rutgers University Press</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nEastwood had been shown the script by [[Elizabeth Taylor]] (at the time, the wife of [[Richard Burton]]) during the filming of ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]''; she hoped to play the role of Sister Sara. It was initially offered to her, but she had to turn down the role because she wanted to shoot in [[Spain]] where Burton was making his latest film.<ref name=\"McGilligan179\"/> Sister Sara was supposed to be Mexican, but Shirley MacLaine was cast instead. Although they were initially unconvinced with her pale complexion,<ref name=\"McGilligan181\">McGilligan (1999), p. 181</ref> Eastwood believed that the studio was keen on MacLaine as they had high hopes for her film ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]'', in which she played a [[taxi dancer]].<ref>p. 11 Eastwood, Clint, Kapsis, Robert E., Coblentz, Kathie ''Clint Eastwood: Interviews'' University of Mississippi Press</ref> Both Siegel and Eastwood felt she was unfriendly on set, and Siegel described MacLaine thus: \"It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine and has too much balls. She's very, very hard.\"<ref name=\"McGilligan182\">McGilligan (1999), p. 182</ref> ''Two Mules for Sister Sara'' marked the last time that Eastwood would receive second billing for a film.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot over 65 days in Mexico and cost around $4 million.<ref name=\"McGilligan183\"/><ref name=\"Hughes21\"/> Many of the cast and crew, including MacLaine, were stricken by illness while filming, due to having to adjust to the food and water in Mexico.<ref>Munn, p. 93</ref>\n\n[[Bruce Surtees]] was a camera operator on the film, and acted as a go-between for Siegel and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]; this led to his working on Siegel's next film ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]''.<ref>p. 101 ''Clint Eastwood''</ref> Figueroa used many [[photographic filter]]s for effects in the film.<ref>p. 46 Maltin, Leonard ''The Art of the Cinematographer'' Dover Publications</ref>\n\nEastwood revealed that he actually killed a rattlesnake for a scene in the film, as Mexican authorities did not want it released in the area after filming was over.
