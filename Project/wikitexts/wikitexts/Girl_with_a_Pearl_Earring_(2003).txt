[[Scarlett Johansson]] stars as Griet, a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] (played by [[Colin Firth]]) at the time he painted ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' (1665) in the city of [[Delft]] in [[Holland]]. Other cast members include [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Essie Davis]], and [[Judy Parfitt]].\n\nHetreed read the novel before its publication, and her husband's production company convinced Chevalier to sell the [[film rights]]. Initially, the production was to feature [[Kate Hudson]] as Griet with [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] directing. Hudson withdrew shortly before filming began, however, and the film was placed in hiatus until the hire of Webber, who re-initiated the casting process.\n\nIn his feature film debut, Webber sought to avoid employing traditional characteristics of the [[period film]] drama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/12/an-interview-with-the-director-and-stars-of-girl-with-a-pearl-earring?page=1|title = An Interview with the Director and Stars of Girl with a Pearl Earring - IGN}}</ref> In a 2003 interview with IGN, he said, \"What I was scared of is ending up with something that was like ''Masterpiece Theatre'', [that] very polite Sunday evening BBC kind of thing, and I [was] determined to make something quite different from that...\". Cinematographer [[Eduardo Serra]] used distinctive lighting and colour schemes similar to Vermeer's paintings.\n\nReleased on 12 December 2003 in North America and on 16 January 2004 in the United Kingdom, ''Girl with a Pearl Earring'' earned a worldwide gross of $31.4 million. It garnered a mostly positive critical reception, with critics generally applauding the film's visuals, musical score, and performances while questioning elements of its story. The film was subsequently nominated for ten [[British Academy Film Award]]s, three [[Academy Awards]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nGriet is a shy girl living in the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1665. Her father, a [[Delftware]] painter, has recently gone blind, rendering him unable to work and leaving his family in a precarious financial situation. Griet is sent to [[Delft]] to work as a maid in the household of famed painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] and his wife, Catharina. On the way there, she stops momentarily at a crossroads.\n\nGriet works diligently and almost wordlessly in the lowest position of a harsh hierarchy. She does her best to adjust, in spite of the unkind treatment from Vermeer's spoiled adolescent daughter, Cornelia. While Griet is on a routine shopping run, a butcher's son, Pieter, is drawn to her. She is slow to return his affections as their relationship develops. As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, which Catharina never enters, the painter begins to converse with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light, and color. He gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks while keeping these secret from Catharina, to avoid angering her. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, [[Maria Thins]], sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.\n\nVermeer's rich [[patron]], [[Pieter van Ruijven|Van Ruijven]], visits the household and notices Griet. He asks if Vermeer will give up Griet so she can work in the patron's house, where Van Ruijven ruined the former girl-maid. Vermeer refuses, but agrees to paint a portrait of Griet for Van Ruijven. As he secretly works on the painting, Catharina notices something is amiss. Her growing disdain for the maid becomes apparent, spurred on by Van Ruijven's deliberate suggestions of an improper relationship between Vermeer and Griet. A conflicted Griet deals with her growing fascination with Vermeer and his talent while fending off Van Ruijven, who attempts to rape her in the courtyard. Later, when Catharina is out for the day, her mother hands Griet her daughter's pearl earrings and asks Vermeer to finish the painting.\n\nAt the final painting session, Vermeer pierces Griet's left earlobe so she can wear one of the earrings for the portrait. Tensions heighten when she reacts in pain and Vermeer caresses her face. She runs to Pieter for consolation and distraction from her thoughts of Vermeer. The two make love in a barn. Pieter proposes marriage, but Griet unexpectedly leaves. She returns the earrings to Catharina's mother.\n\nCatharina flies into a rage upon discovering Griet wore her earrings and storms into the studio, accusing her mother of complicity. She demands Vermeer show her the commissioned portrait. Offended by the intimate nature of the painting, Catharina dismisses it as \"obscene\" and tearfully asks why Vermeer wouldn't paint her. When Vermeer responds that she doesn't understand, she tries but fails to destroy the painting. She banishes Griet from the house. Vermeer does not object. Griet returns to her parents' home and stands once again at crossroads. Van Ruijven sits looking smugly at the finished painting. Later, she receives a visit at her parents' home from Vermeer's cook, Tanneke, who brings a gift: the blue headscarf Griet wore in the painting, wrapped around Catharina's pearl earrings.\n\nIn the final shot, the camera zooms out from the earring to reveal the full real-life painting, ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Colin Firth]] as [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Griet\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[Pieter van Ruijven]]\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] as [[Maria Thins]]\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Pieter\n* [[Essie Davis]] as Catharina Vermeer \n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Tanneke\n* Alakina Mann as Cornelia Vermeer \n* [[Chris McHallem]] as Griet's Father\n* [[Gabrielle Reidy]] as Griet's Mother\n* [[Rollo Weeks]] as Frans\n* [[Anna Popplewell]] as Maertge\n* [[Geoff Bell (actor)|Geoff Bell]] as Paul The Butcher\n* [[John McEnery]] as Apothecary\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{overquoting|date=February 2020}}\n[[Image:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|right|Vermeer's original painting, ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' from 1665]]\nThe production of ''Girl with a Pearl Earring'' began in 1999, when screenwriter [[Olivia Hetreed]] gained access to [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (novel)|Tracy Chevalier's novel ''Girl with a Pearl Earring'']] shortly before its publication in August.<ref name=Prank>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3602272/I-thought-Whos-playing-a-prank.html |title=I thought: 'Who's playing a prank?' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Cassandra |last=Jardine |date=9 September 2003 |access-date=23 February 2014}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Screenwriter Olivia Hetreed gained early access to the book because she shared the same agent as Chevalier,<ref name=dailytelegraphJan2004/><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112128197.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611075106/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112128197.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=11 June 2014 |title=Novel adventure: deep connections to source material were key to this year's adaptations |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |first=Christopher |last=Grove |date=18 December 2003 |access-date=26 February 2014}} {{Subscription needed}}</ref> and read it in two hours.<ref name=WPinterview/>|group=\"note\"}} The novel had not yet become a best-seller, but several groups were beginning to show interest.<ref name=dailytelegraphJan2004/> Hetreed loved the character of Griet and \"her determination to be free in a world where that was almost impossible for a girl from her background\".<ref name=productionnotes/> [[Anand Tucker]] and Hetreed's husband [[Andy Paterson]]&nbsp;\u2013 both producers with the small British studio Archer Street Films<ref name=WPinterview/><ref name=\"hudson\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 approached the novel's author, [[Tracy Chevalier]], for a film adaptation.
