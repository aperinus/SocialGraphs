The film featured [[Fred Ward]], [[Joel Grey]], [[J. A. Preston]], [[Wilford Brimley]], and [[Kate Mulgrew]].\n\nThe character is based on ''[[The Destroyer (novel series)|The Destroyer]]'' pulp paperback series, featuring the character [[Remo Williams (character)|Remo Williams]]. It fared poorly in theaters and received mixed reviews from critics, although it did earn Joel Grey a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. The film and a ''Remo Williams'' television pilot both credited [[Dick Clark]] as [[executive producer]]. The film was supposed to be the first of a series based on ''The Destroyer'' series of novels.<ref name=\"LA\"/>\nA significant [[setpiece]] within the film takes place at the [[Statue of Liberty]], which was surrounded by scaffolding for [[Conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty|its centenary restoration]] during this period.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Makin is a tough Brooklyn, [[New York City]] street cop and Vietnam-era [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] veteran. He is unwillingly recruited as an assassin for a secret United States organization, CURE. The recruitment is through a bizarre method: his death is faked and he is given a new face and a new name. Rechristened \"Remo Williams\" (after the name and location of the manufacturer of the bedpan in Makin's hospital room), his face is surgically altered and he is trained to be a human killing machine by his aged, derisive and impassive Korean martial arts master Chiun.\n\nThough Remo's training is extremely rushed by Chiun's standards, Remo learns seemingly impossible skills such as dodging bullets and running on water and wet cement. Chiun teaches Remo the Korean martial art named \"[[Sinanju (martial art)|Sinanju]]\".  Remo's instruction is interrupted when he is sent by CURE to investigate a corrupt weapons procurement program within the US Army.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Officer Samuel Edward \"Sam\" Makin / CURE Agent [[Remo Williams (character)|Remo Williams]]\n* [[Joel Grey]] as [[Sinanju (martial art)|Master of Sinanju]] [[The Destroyer (novel series)|Chiun]]\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as CURE Director [[The Destroyer (novel series)|Harold W.

The shots of the replica were intercut with footage shot at the real Statue of Liberty.\n\nOn the casting of the white actor Joel Grey, who went through four and a half hours of make-up every day to look like an elderly Korean, producer Larry Spiegel claimed \"We assumed, of course, that we would be using an oriental actor. We couldn't find one and then I thought of Grey.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Joel Grey Masters Oriental Character for Role in 'Remo'|author=Julia Cameron|date=October 13, 1985|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> This casting was highly controversial.<ref>OUTTAKES: OUTTAKES\nKim, Sophia.

However, the title song, ''Remo's Theme (What If)'', written and sung by [[Styx (band)|Styx]] member [[Tommy Shaw]], is not included on that album.
