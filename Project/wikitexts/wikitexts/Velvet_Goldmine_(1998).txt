It is set in Britain during the [[glam rock]] days of the early 1970s, and tells the story of fictional bisexual pop star Brian Slade, who faked his own death. The film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]] and won the award for the Best Artistic Contribution. [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] received a [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]]. The film utilizes [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear storytelling]] to achieve [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] while interweaving the vignettes of its various characters.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 1984, British journalist Arthur Stuart is writing an article about the withdrawal from public life of 1970s [[glam rock]] star Brian Slade following a death hoax ten years earlier, and is interviewing those who had a part in the entertainer's career. As each person recalls their thoughts, it becomes the introduction of the vignette for that particular segment in Slade's personal and professional life.\n\nPart of the story involves Stuart's family's reaction to his [[homosexuality]], and how the gay and bisexual glam rock stars and music scene gave him the strength to come out. Rock shows, fashion, and rock journalism all play a role in showing the youth culture of 1970s Britain, as well as the gay culture of the time. At the beginning of his career, Slade is married to Mandy. But when he comes to the [[United States]], he seeks out American rock star Curt Wild, and they become involved in each other's lives.\n\nThe vignettes show Wild and Slade becoming increasingly difficult to work with as they become more famous. They suffer breakdowns in their personal and professional relationships. Eventually, Slade's career ends following the critical and fan backlash from his on-stage publicity stunt where he faked his own murder.\n\nAs he gets closer to the truth of where Slade is now, Stuart is suddenly told by his editor that the story is no longer of public interest and Stuart has been assigned to the Tommy Stone tour, which coincidentally is Brian Slade's new identity. We discover Stuart was also at the concert where Slade faked his own death, and that after seeing Wild perform on another night, Wild and Stuart had a sexual encounter.\n\nEventually, Stuart confronts Tommy Stone and once again encounters Wild, who casually passes on a piece of jewellry from Oscar Wilde.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Curt Wild \n* [[Christian Bale]] as Arthur Stuart\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Brian Slade\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Mandy Slade\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as Jerry Devine \n* Micko Westmoreland as Jack Fairy \n* [[Alastair Cumming]] as Tommy Stone\n* [[Emily Woof]] as Shannon\n* [[Joseph Beattie]] as Cooper\n* [[Michael Feast]] as Cecil\n* [[Lindsay Kemp]] as Pantomime Dame\n* [[Janet McTeer]] as Female Narrator\n* [[Carlos Miranda]] as Pianist\n* [[Sarah Cawood]] as Angel\n* [[David Hoyle (performance artist)|David Hoyle]] as Freddi\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film centers on Brian Slade, a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[androgynous]] glam rock icon who was patterned after [[David Bowie]], [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Jobriath]] and [[Marc Bolan]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Fricke|first=David|date=1998-11-26|title=Weird Scenes From the Velvet Goldmine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/velvet-goldmine-movie-ewan-mcgregor-todd-haynes-890097/|access-date=2022-01-01|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> The Director, Todd Haynes, requested access to Bowie's song catalogue along with a personal blessing to make the film but Bowie refused, saying that he intended to make a similar film about the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  [[Ewan McGregor]] co-stars in the role of Curt Wild, a genre-defying performer who doesn't back down from sex, nudity or drugs on or off stage and whose biographical details are based on [[Iggy Pop]] (who grew up in a trailer park) and [[Lou Reed]] (whose parents sent him to [[electroshock therapy]] to 'cure' his [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] feelings).<ref name=\"Brooklyn Rail\">\"[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/5/music/limping-with-the-stooges-in-washington-h Limping with the Stooges in Washington Heights]\" in ''The Brooklyn Rail''</ref><ref>''Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk ''(1996)</ref> Also featured are [[Christian Bale]] as the young glam rock fan and reporter, Arthur Stuart and [[Toni Collette]] as Slade's wife, Mandy, who is based on Bowie's first wife, [[Angela Bowie|Angela]].<ref>Richard Harrington, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195641/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-690815.html \"Gone Glam Digging; `Velvet Goldmine' Unearths '70s Tale\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 6 November 1998 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> [[Eddie Izzard]] stars as Slade's manager, Jerry Devine.\n\nThe tale strongly parallels Bowie's relationships with Reed and Pop in the 1970s and 1980s. Brian Slade's gradually overwhelming stage persona of \"Maxwell Demon\" and his backing band, \"Venus in Furs\", resemble Bowie's persona and backing band. The album ''[[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' tells a similar story of a rock star gone over the edge and culminates in his assassination. As with Slade and Wild, Bowie produced records for and with, Pop and Reed. The band name \"Venus in Furs\" is taken from a song by Lou Reed's early band, [[The Velvet Underground]], which was taken from [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]'s eponymous [[Venus in Furs|novel]], which appeared on their first album. Maxwell Demon was the name of an early band of [[Brian Eno]], a long-time Bowie associate, whose music is heard at various points in the film.\n\nHaynes has said that the story is also about the love affair between America and Britain, [[New York City]] and [[London]], in the way each music scene feeds off and influences each other.<ref name=Moverman>Moverman, Oren (1998) \"Superstardust: Talking Glam with Todd Haynes\", an interview in the introduction of ''Velvet Goldmine, A Screenplay by Todd Haynes'', Hyperion: New York</ref> [[Little Richard]] is shown as an early influence on Brian Slade. Little Richard inspired [[the Beatles]] and Bowie, who in turn inspired many other bands. Little Richard has also been cited by Haynes as the inspiration for Jack Fairy.<ref name=Moverman />\n\nThe film is strongly influenced by the ideas and life of [[Oscar Wilde]] (seen in the film as a progenitor of glam rock), and refers to events in his life and quotes his work on dozens of occasions. [[Jean Genet]] (the subject of Haynes' previous film, ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'', and the putative inspiration for the title of Bowie's song \"[[The Jean Genie]]\") is referred to in imagery and also quoted in dialogue.\n\nThe film's narrative structure is modelled on that of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in that the reporter Stuart tries to solve a mystery about Slade, travelling to interview Slade's lovers and colleagues, whose recollections are shown in 1950s, 1960s and 1970s flashbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/11-09-98/boston_movies_1.html |title='Velvet Goldmine' stirs up the glam past| date= 9 November 1998 | first= Matt | last = Ashare | work=Boston Phoenix |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001120091900/http://weeklywire.com/ww/11-09-98/boston_movies_1.html |archive-date=November 20, 2000}}</ref>\n\nDavid Bowie was ambivalent about ''Velvet Goldmine'' upon release.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-04|title=David Bowie: the man who sold the world wide web|url=https://www.bigissue.com/culture/music/david-bowie-the-man-who-sold-the-world-wide-web/|access-date=2022-01-01|website=The Big Issue|language=en}}</ref> According to Bowie, \u201cWhen I saw the film I thought the best thing about it was the gay scenes.

Slade's persona \"Maxwell Demon\" was named after [[Brian Eno]]'s first band, which itself was influenced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s thought experiment character, \"[[Maxwell's demon]]\".\n* Wild's backing band, The Rats, shares its name with one of [[Mick Ronson]]'s earliest groups.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Velvet Goldmine - The Movie |url=http://www.5years.com/velvetfilm2.htm |access-date= |website=www.5years.com}}</ref> It also alludes to Iggy Pop's band, [[The Stooges]] in that both words share a similar meaning (\"rat\" and \"stooge\" both being terms for someone who is an informer).\n* The scene where couples are shown walking into the Sombrero Club on New Year's Eve 1969 is similar to a shot of people entering a party from Welles' film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n* Maxwell Demon's guitarist shares his name, Trevor, with Bowie's [[The Spiders from Mars]] bassist [[Trevor Bolder]], and his last name is Finn, as [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] percussionist [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]].\n* \"Venus in Furs\" is a reference to a Velvet Underground [[Venus in Furs (song)|song of the same name]], whose title and lyrics in turn reference a [[Venus in Furs|novel of that name]] by [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]].\n* ''[[Flaming Creatures]]'' is also the name of [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]'s seminal piece of gay cinema.\n* Much of the script consists of quotations from various works of [[Oscar Wilde]], and several of the scenes involving the character Jack Fairy reference the novels of [[Jean Genet]].\n* The bleak, [[dystopian]] feel of the action taking place in 1984 alludes to the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], to Bowie's own dystopian [[1984 (song)|song of the same name]], and to Bowie's reinvention of himself as a mainstream entertainer during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] era.\n* The \"pantomime dame\" from the vaudeville troupe is played by influential dancer [[Lindsay Kemp]], a former teacher of Bowie's who collaborated with him on several music videos, including \"[[John, I'm Only Dancing]]\".\n* The little girl on the train is reading \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" (a poem by [[William Hughes Mearns]]), which was inspiration for [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold The World]]\".\n* Arthur Stuart's boss has [[mydriasis]] in his left eye, much like Bowie's.\n* \"The Ballad of Maxwell Demon\" contains the lyrics: \"The boys from Quadrant 44 with their vicious metal hounds never come 'round here no more,\" referencing [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]], ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''. This is likely an allusion to Bowie basing an entire album (''[[Diamond Dogs]]'') on the dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.\n*The scene near the middle of the film that portrays Slade and Wild about to make love as [[Barbie]] Dolls, pays homage to Haynes' earlier work in ''[[Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story]]'', which was acted out primarily with the dolls.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite journal|last=Padva |first=Gilad |title=Claiming Lost Gay Youth, Embracing Femininostalgia: Todd Haynes's ''Dottie Gets Spanked'' and ''Velvet Goldmine''. |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137266347_5\n|journal=Queer Nostalgia in Cinema and Pop Culture |page=72\u201397 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2014 |doi=10.1057/9781137266347_5 |isbn=978-1-137-26633-0}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0120879}}\n* {{Mojo title|velvetgoldmine}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|velvet_goldmine}}\n* [{{AllMusic|class=album|r380467|pure_url=yes}} Review of ''Velvet Goldmine'' Original Soundtrack] ({{Rating|4|5}}) from [[AllMusic]]\n\n{{Todd Haynes}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Velvet Goldmine}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British musical drama films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:American rock music films]]\n[[Category:British rock music films]]\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films about singers]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Todd Haynes]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Christine Vachon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1974]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1984]]\n[[Category:Films set in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Punk films]]\n[[Category:Killer Films films]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Newmarket Capital Group films]]\n[[Category:1998 independent films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of David Bowie]]\n[[Category:Films \u00e0 clef]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Glam rock]]\n[[Category:Male bisexuality in film]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
