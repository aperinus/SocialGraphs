Carano, a [[mixed martial arts]] fighter, performs her own stunts in the film. The score is by DJ and composer [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]].\n\nThe plot centers on Mallory Kane (Carano), a [[black ops]] operative who is betrayed by her employers and targeted for assassination in a conspiracy that she is forced to unravel. The film premiered on November 6, 2011 at the [[American Film Institute]]'s AFI Fest and received a wide release on January 20, 2012 by [[Relativity Media]]. It had generally positive critical reception, with critics praising its action, choreography, performances and Soderbergh's direction, but with some criticism levied at newcomer Carano's performance.<ref>{{Citation|title=Haywire (2012)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/haywire_2011|language=en|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref> The film grossed $34.5 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haywire.htm|title=Haywire (2012) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt an [[Upstate New York]] diner, a woman named Mallory Kane meets an associate of hers named Aaron. The two have a seemingly affable conversation, before Aaron demands she get in a car outside. When she refuses, he attacks her and pulls a gun, but she disarms and pistol whips him. Meanwhile Scott, a customer, had intervened to help Mallory, who proceeds to demand his car keys and that he get in his car to go away with her. As they flee, she explains who she is and what has happened to her.\n\nMallory explains that she and Aaron are operatives of a secretive [[Private intelligence agency|private intelligence firm]] that handles highly sensitive [[black operation]]s covertly so that their employers can maintain [[plausible deniability]]. One week earlier, the firm's director and Mallory's ex-boyfriend Kenneth gave her an assignment offered by [[CIA]] agent Coblenz; to rescue Jiang, a Chinese national being held hostage in a [[Barcelona]] apartment. Mallory and her team, including Aaron, successfully pull off the job and deliver the mark to a local contact named Rodrigo.\n\nUpon returning to the [[United States]], Mallory is approached by Kenneth with what he claims is a simple assignment: pose as the wife of [[MI6]] agent Paul during a mission in [[Dublin]]. Mallory agrees and accompanies Paul to a party at [[Russborough House]], where they meet with his contact, Studer. As Mallory watches from afar, she sees Paul go into a barn. Upon entering, she finds Jiang dead, clutching in his hand a [[brooch]] which Kenneth had insisted she wear as a recognition signal for her initial contact with Paul. Mallory realizes she has been set up.\n\nOn returning to their hotel room, Paul attacks Mallory and tries to kill her, but she manages to fend him off and shoot him dead. Checking Paul's phone, she redials a missed call only for Kenneth to pick up, asking if \"the divorce was final\". Kenneth realizes he's been made, and sends his agents after her. She narrowly avoids both of them and the police, escaping onto a ferry to [[England]].\n\nMallory calls Rodrigo and demands to know if it was he or Kenneth who set her up. Rodrigo calls Coblenz, who then calls Mallory, telling her that he has had suspicions about Kenneth before claiming to arrange a meeting between the two in an Upstate New York diner. Coblenz then contacts Kenneth and tells him to inform Mallory's father, John, of her purported crimes.\n\nIn the present, Mallory and Scott are captured by police. Both are taken into custody but the police are ambushed and killed by Kenneth's men. Mallory manages to kill one of them and flees with Scott in one of the police cars. She releases Scott and leaves to meet with her father. She reaches his house in [[New Mexico]] before Kenneth, Aaron and two other men arrive to interrogate him about his daughter's whereabouts. Aaron receives a photograph on his phone of Jiang lying dead, and it dawns on him that Mallory might have been set up. He tries to press Kenneth for the truth, but Kenneth shoots him and escapes, as Mallory takes out Kenneth's other men. Aaron apologizes to Mallory as he dies in her arms.\n\nMallory meets Coblenz, who reveals that he told Kenneth to contact Mallory's father, expecting that Kenneth would go to her father's house and that she would kill him there. Coblenz also gives her Kenneth's present location. Before they part, he offers her a job with the CIA, but she says she will respond after she has found Kenneth.\n\nIn [[Mexico]], Mallory confronts Kenneth on a beach and they fight. Kenneth's foot becomes jammed between rocks. Unable to escape, he reveals that Jiang was a [[journalist]] who was being protected in a [[safe house]] after having exposed Studer's ties to a [[human trafficking]] ring. Knowing that Mallory planned to leave his firm, Kenneth arranged for her to kidnap Jiang and deliver him to Rodrigo, who delivered him to Studer, who killed him. Kenneth then framed Mallory, planning to cut all ties that could lead to him, telling Paul the cover story he would have in place after Paul had killed her in alleged self-defense. Ignoring Kenneth's pleas, Mallory leaves Kenneth to drown in the incoming tide.\n\nA few days later, Mallory locates Rodrigo, who is on vacation in [[Majorca]]. She approaches him to confront him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gina Carano]] as Mallory Kane\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Kenneth\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Alex Coblenz\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Paul\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as John Kane\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Aaron\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Rodrigo\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Scott\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Studer\n* Eddie J.
