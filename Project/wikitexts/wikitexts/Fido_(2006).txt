It was produced by Blake Corbet, Mary Anne Waterhouse, Trent Carlson and [[Kevin Eastwood]] of Anagram Pictures, and released in the United States by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place in a 1950s-esque [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where radiation from space has turned the dead into [[zombie]]s. This resulted in the \"Zombie Wars\", where humanity battled zombies to prevent a [[zombie apocalypse]], with humanity the ultimate victor. The radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die turn into the undead, unless the dead body is disposed of by decapitation or cremation. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named ZomCon. ZomCon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as menial task servants.\n\nIn the town of Willard, housewife Helen Robinson ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) buys a zombie ([[Billy Connolly]]) in spite of her husband Bill's ([[Dylan Baker]]) zombie [[phobia]], as Bill had to kill his own father who had become a zombie and tried to eat him. Their son, Timmy ([[K'Sun Ray]]), befriends the zombie, naming him \"Fido\" (little is revealed of his \"pre-zombie\" life, except that he likely died of [[myocardial infarction]] as evidenced by the chest incision). One day, Fido's collar malfunctions and he accidentally kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy \"kills\" the zombified neighbor later, but not before she kills and infects another person, causing a small zombie outbreak. ZomCon security forces quell the situation and then investigate what caused the outbreak.\n\nWhen a pair of local bullies get caught shooting a ZomCon officer, they are suspected of shooting the missing neighbor, but they point the blame on Fido who hurt them when they tried bullying Timmy. The bullies later capture Fido and Timmy, who are out on a walk in the country. Fido escapes and, in a parody of Lassie, is sent by Timmy to go home and find Helen. Helen comes and rescues Timmy from the bullies (who, through their own misadventure and Fido's hunger for human flesh, are now zombies), and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is 'uncovered' and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to ZomCon where the family is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through Cindy Bottoms ([[Alexia Fast]]), daughter of Jonathan Bottoms ([[Henry Czerny]]), ZomCon's zealous security chief, that Fido has been put to work in a factory at ZomCon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help of Mr. Theopolis ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), a previous ZomCon employee who was forced to leave when it was discovered he was suspected of fraternizing with his attractive female zombie.\n\nMeanwhile, Timmy locates Fido, but is captured by Mr. Bottoms, who attempts to throw Timmy into the zombie-infested \"wild zone\" that exists outside of the fenced communities as punishment for his becoming attached to a zombie. Bill comes to the rescue and is killed in a struggle with Mr. Bottoms, who in turn is killed by Fido. Timmy is set free and the news media states that the ZomCon security breach was the fault of rednecks who ventured out into the wild zone to hunt zombies for fun. Helen gives Bill the headless funeral he always wanted in order to prevent his zombification. The film ends with Fido as a surrogate father to Timmy, Helen, and Helen's newborn baby. They, along with a few neighbors, happily enjoy their new domestic lives together, including the zombified Jonathan Bottoms who is now under the control of his daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[K'Sun Ray]] as Timmy Robinson\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as Fido\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Helen Robinson\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Mr. Theopolis\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Bill Robinson\n* [[Henry Czerny]] as Jonathan Bottoms\n* [[Sonja Bennett]] as Tammy\n* [[Alexia Fast]] as Cindy Bottoms\n* Aaron Brown as Roy Fraser\n* Brandon Olds as Stan Fraser\n* Jennifer Clement as Dee Dee Bottoms\n* Rob LaBelle as Frank Murphy\n* Tiffany Lyndall-Knight as Miss Mills\n* Mary Black as Mrs. Henderson\n* Raymond E.

Currie was influenced by ''[[Lassie Come Home]]'', ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'', [[Douglas Sirk]] films of the 1950s, ''[[Peyton Place (film)|Peyton Place]]'', and [[George A. Romero]]'s zombie films. The script was originally written in 1994, but creative differences kept it tied up. Eventually, Currie optioned it through his production company and completed the picture. The film was completely storyboarded prior to filming.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide|last=Kay|first=Glenn|publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]]|year=2008|isbn=9781569766835|pages=269\u2013272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBfGajftevEC&pg=PA269}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Fido'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it was the Opening Canadian Gala film.<ref name=premiere/> It was also shown at the [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Vancouver International Film Festival]], the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]], the 2007 [[Kingston Canadian Film Festival]], the 2007 [[Florida Film Festival]], and the [[Festival international du film fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer|2007 G\u00e9rardmer Fantasy Filmfest]] in France.
