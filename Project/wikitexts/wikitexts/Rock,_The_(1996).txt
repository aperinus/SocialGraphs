Cook]]. The film stars [[Sean Connery]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Ed Harris]], with [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] and [[Michael Biehn]] co-starring. In the film, the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] assigns a team comprising an [[FBI]] chemist and a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] captain with a team of [[United States Navy SEALs|SEALs]] to break into [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]], where a rogue general and a rogue group of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marines]] have seized all the tourists on [[Alcatraz Island|the island]] and have threatened to launch rockets filled with [[nerve gas]] upon [[San Francisco]] unless the U.S. government pays $100 million to the next-of-kin of 83 men who were killed on missions that the general led and that the Pentagon denied.\n\n''The Rock'' was dedicated to the memory of co-producer Don Simpson,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/07/movies/film-review-break-into-alcatraz-why-not.html | title=FILM REVIEW;Break into Alcatraz?

The film received positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] at the [[69th Academy Awards]]. It was also a financial success, earning box-office receipts of over $335&nbsp;million against a production budget of $75&nbsp;million, and became the [[1996 in film|fourth highest-grossing film of 1996]].\n\n==Plot==\nDisillusioned [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Francis Hummel and his second-in-command [[Major (United States)|Major]] Tom Baxter lead a rogue group of [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Force Recon Marines]] against a heavily guarded naval weapons depot to steal a stockpile of 16 [[VX (nerve agent)|VX gas]]-loaded [[M55 (rocket)|M55]] rockets, ultimately losing one of their own men in the process. The next day, along with newly recruited  [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captains]] Frye and Darrow, Hummel and his men seize control of [[Alcatraz Island]], taking 81 tourists hostage. Hummel threatens to launch the rockets against [[San Francisco]] unless the U.S. government pays him $100&nbsp;million from a military [[slush fund]], which he will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who died on clandestine missions under his command, but whose deaths were not compensated.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] develop a plan to retake the island using a [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] team led by Commander Anderson, the FBI's top chemical weapons specialist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, and the only inmate to ever escape Alcatraz: John Mason. [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] James Womack bribes Mason with a pardon (which Womack subsequently destroys) and Mason is set up in a hotel. He escapes, resulting in a car chase with Goodspeed through the streets of San Francisco as Mason seeks out his estranged daughter, Jade. They meet but she accuses him of escaping again when Goodspeed arrives; he covers for Mason by telling Jade that Mason is aiding the FBI.\n\nThe team successfully infiltrates Alcatraz, but Hummel's men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in a shower room. Anderson and all of the SEALs are killed, leaving only Mason and Goodspeed alive. Goodspeed wants to finish the mission and attempts to strong-arm Mason into helping. Mason, seeing his chance to escape custody, disarms Goodspeed. Mason changes his mind about helping Goodspeed when the Marines, having found the weapons and radio missing from Anderson's second-in-command, start using bombs to ferret out the survivors.\n\nMason and Goodspeed eliminate several teams of Marines and disable twelve of the fifteen rockets by removing their guidance chips. Hummel threatens to execute a hostage if they do not surrender and return the chips; Mason destroys them before surrendering to Hummel to try reasoning with him and stall for time. Goodspeed disables another rocket but then gets captured. With the incursion team lost, the backup plan is initiated: an airstrike by [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18C]]s with [[thermite]] plasma, which will neutralize the poison gas but also kill everyone on the island.\n\nMason and Goodspeed escape and Mason explains why he was held prisoner: as a former British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] captain and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] operative, he was captured after stealing a microfilm containing details of the United States' most closely guarded secrets. Knowing he would be \"suicided\" if he returned it, he spent the last thirty years imprisoned without trial for refusing to hand it over.\n\nWhen Hummel's deadline for the ransom passes, he is urged by his men to fire a rocket. Although he does, he redirects it to detonate at sea. Hummel, confronted by Darrow and Frye, explains the rocket threat was an elaborate bluff, as he had never intended to harm innocent civilians. He declares the mission over and orders them to exit Alcatraz with some hostages and the remaining rocket to cover their retreat while he assumes blame. Darrow and Frye, realizing they will not be paid their $1&nbsp;million apiece, mutiny against him. They declare themselves mercenaries and a firefight ensues; Baxter is killed and Hummel is mortally wounded, but Hummel manages to tell Goodspeed where the last rocket is before dying.\n\nDarrow and Frye proceed with the plan to fire on San Francisco. Goodspeed seeks out the rocket while Mason deals with the remaining Marines. As the jets approach, Goodspeed disables the rocket before killing both Darrow and Frye. Though he signals that the threat is over, one jet drops a bomb. No hostages are injured, but the blast throws Goodspeed into the bay and Mason rescues him.\n\nGoodspeed reports a successful mission but lies that Mason died during the blast; he admits to Mason that Womack tore up the pardon and offers him a way off the island and cash in his hotel room. Mason reveals the location of the microfilm as he and Goodspeed part ways. Sometime later, Goodspeed and his newlywed wife Carla hastily drive away from a church in [[Kansas]] after having retrieved the microfilm, which features evidence of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s real[[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories| ]]assassin.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:8.23.12MichaelBiehnByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|Cast member [[Michael Biehn]] signing the cover of the film on DVD in 2012]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Captain John Patrick Mason\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[FBI Special Agent]] Dr. Stanley Goodspeed\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Brigadier General Francis X. \"Frank\" Hummel, USMC Force Recon\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as [[FBI Director]] Jim Womack\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Major Tom Baxter, USMC Force Recon\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Ernest Paxton\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as Commander Charles Anderson, USN SEAL\n* [[Vanessa Marcil]] as Carla Pestalozzi\n* [[John C.

The spec script (by [[David Weisberg]] and [[Douglas S. Cook|Douglas Cook]]) was reworked by several writers, but other than the original team, Mark Rosner was the only one granted official credit by guild arbitration. The rule is that the credited writing team must contribute 50% of the final script (effectively limiting credits to the screenplay's initial authors, plus one re-write team). Despite their work on the script, neither Hensleigh nor [[Aaron Sorkin]] was credited in the film. The director [[Michael Bay]] wrote an open letter of protest, in which he criticized the arbitration procedure as a \"sham\" and a \"travesty\".  He said Hensleigh had worked closely with him on the movie and should have received screen credit.<ref>Welkos, Robert W.

On the commentary track for the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD, Bay recalls a time when he was preparing to leave the set for a meeting with the executives when he was approached by [[Sean Connery]] in golfing attire. Connery, who also produced the film, asked Bay where he was going, and when Bay explained he had a meeting with the executives, Connery asked if he could accompany him. Bay complied and when he arrived in the conference room, the executives' jaws dropped when they saw Connery appear behind him. According to Bay, Connery then stood up for Bay and insisted that he was doing a good job and should be left alone.\n\nMost of the film was shot on location in the [[Alcatraz Prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. As it is governed by the [[National Park Service]], it was not possible to close down Alcatraz, and much of the filming had to accommodate tour parties milling around.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/Rock-1996.php |title=The Rock 1996 |website=Movie-Locations |access-date=December 18, 2018 |archive-date=December 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213032104/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/r/Rock-1996.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The scene in which FBI Director Womack is thrown off the balcony was filmed on location at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] in San Francisco.

Other cuts included the reduction of multiple gunshot impacts into Gamble's feet in the morgue down to a single hit; a close-up of his screaming face as the air conditioner falls onto him; a sound cut to Mason snapping a Marine's neck and two bloody gunshot wounds (to Hummel and Baxter), both near the end of the film.<ref name=MF/>\n\n===Iraqi chemical weapons program===\nA scene from the film was the basis for incorrect and false descriptions of the [[Iraqi chemical weapons program]]. Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] was led to believe [[Saddam Hussein]] was continuing to produce [[weapons of mass destruction]] by a false agent who based his reports on the movie, according to the [[Chilcot Inquiry]].\n\nIn September 2002, MI6 chief Sir [[Richard Dearlove]] said the agency had acquired information from a new source revealing that Iraq was stepping up production of chemical and biological warfare agents. The source, who was said to have \"direct access\", claimed senior staff were working seven days a week while the regime was concentrating a great deal of effort on the production of anthrax. Dearlove told the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), Sir [[John Scarlett]], that they were \"on the edge of (a) significant intel breakthrough\" which could be the \"key to unlock\" Iraq's weapons programme.\n\nHowever, questions were raised about the agent's claims when it was noticed his description bore a striking resemblance to a scene from the film. \"It was pointed out that glass containers were not typically used in chemical munitions, and that a popular movie (''The Rock'') had inaccurately depicted nerve agents being carried in glass beads or spheres,\" the Chilcot report stated. By February 2003 \u2013 a month before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] \u2013 MI6 concluded that their source had been lying \"over a period of time\" but failed to inform [[10 Downing Street|No 10]] or others, even though  Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] had been briefed on this intelligence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/movie-plot-the-rock-inspired-mi6-sources-iraqi-weapons-claim-chilcot-report|title=The Rock movie plot 'may have inspired MI6 source's Iraqi weapons claim'|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=July 6, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-date=July 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707152917/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/movie-plot-the-rock-inspired-mi6-sources-iraqi-weapons-claim-chilcot-report|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/mi6-iraq-nerve-gas-report-stolen-from-action-film-the-rock/|title=MI6 Iraq nerve gas report 'stolen from action film The Rock'|work=The Telegraph|date=July 6, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-date=April 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406214925/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/06/mi6-iraq-nerve-gas-report-stolen-from-action-film-the-rock/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/supposed-iraqi-wmd-described-in-intelligence-dossier-resembled-inaccurate-portrayal-in-1996-holywood-a7123341.html|title=Supposed Iraqi WMD described in dossier resembled inaccurate portrayal in Holywood film The Rock, Chilcot notes|date=July 6, 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-date=May 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517071918/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/supposed-iraqi-wmd-described-in-intelligence-dossier-resembled-inaccurate-portrayal-in-1996-holywood-a7123341.html|url-status=live}}</ref> According to ''[[The Independent]]'', the false claims of weapons of mass destruction were the justification for UK's entering the war.<ref name=\"independent\"/>\n\nThe film's co-writer David Weisberg said, \"What was so amazing was anybody in the poison gas community would immediately know that this was total bullshit \u2013 such obvious bullshit\".
