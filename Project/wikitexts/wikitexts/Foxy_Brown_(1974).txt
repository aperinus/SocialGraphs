It stars [[Pam Grier]] as the title character who takes on a gang of white drug dealers who murdered her boyfriend.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 4, 2010 |title=Pam Grier looks back on blaxploitation: 'At the time some people were horrified' |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/06/04/pam-grier/ |url-status=dead |access-date=April 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725154203/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/06/04/pam-grier/ |archive-date=July 25, 2011}}</ref> The film was released by [[American International Pictures]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[Truck Turner]]''. The film uses [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] references in clothing and hair. Grier starred in six blaxploitation films for American International Pictures.\n\nWhile not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the United Kingdom under section 3 of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] during the [[video nasty]] panic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Video Nasties Seizures |url=https://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/nasties_seizures.htm#foxy_brown |access-date=October 26, 2022 |website=melonfarmers.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFoxy Brown seeks revenge when her government-agent boyfriend is shot down at her doorstep by members of a drug syndicate. She links her boyfriend's murderers to a \"[[Brothel|modeling agency]]\" run by Stevie Elias and Kathryn Wall that services local judges, congressmen, and police in the area. Foxy decides to pose as a prostitute to infiltrate the company, and helps save a fellow black woman from a life of drugs and sexual exploitation, and reunites her with her husband and child.\n\nNot long after she infiltrates the company, her relationship to her late boyfriend and her brother, Lincoln 'Link' Brown, who ratted her boyfriend out, is exposed. She is caught before she can escape. After an exchange of words and heated death threats, Kathryn decides to keep her alive in hopes of her being worth some money in the sex-slave trade. They give her a shot of heroin and then send her to a farm, which is actually a drug manufacturing plant, with two of Miss Kathryn's henchmen. After she wakes from her sleep, she tries to escape her captors, but is caught by one of the henchmen with a whip and dragged back to the bedroom, where he proceeds to tie her to the bed. Then, Kathryn's second goon comes and gives Foxy another shot of heroin, and the dealer subsequently rapes her.\n\nUsing her quick thinking, Foxy uses a razor to get free and escapes her captors by setting the farm on fire. Kathryn orders Stevie to kill Foxy; he vainly attempts to scare information out of Link, and then kills him and his girlfriend. Foxy asks her [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] brothers for help; they kill Stevie's partners in crime, capture Stevie and castrate him. Foxy comes to Kathryn's house and shows her the jar containing Stevie's genitals. After killing Kathryn's guards and shooting her in the arm with a hidden pistol, Foxy says that death is too easy for her and wants her to suffer the way that Kathryn made her suffer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Foxy Brown\n* [[Antonio Fargas]] as Lincoln \"Link\" Brown\n* [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]] as Stevie Elias\n* Kathryn Loder as Miss Kathryn Wall\n* [[Terry Carter]] as Dalton Ford / Michael Anderson\n* [[Harry Holcombe]] as Judge Fenton\n* [[Sid Haig]] as Hays\n* Juanita Brown as Claudia\n* [[Robert Lee Minor|Bob Minor]] as Oscar\n* [[Tony Giorgio (actor)|Tony Giorgio]] as Eddie\n* Fred Lerner as Bunyon\n* [[Hard Boiled Haggerty|H.B. Haggerty]] as Brandi\n* Boyd \"Red\" Morgan as Slauson\n}}\n\n==Themes and analysis==\n===Stereotypes===\nAccording to Yvonne D. Sims in her book ''Women of Blaxploitation'', ''Foxy Brown'' was heavily criticized, not only for its \u201cdisturbing\u201d portrayal of black womanhood, but also for its controversial stereotypes about violence and drug abuse in black culture. In a time when [[African Americans]] were making progress politically, socially, and culturally, ''Foxy Brown'''s heroine contradicted the image they were creating for themselves in society. Though Foxy is considered a heroine in this film, her role as vengeful black woman willing to pose as a prostitute and exposing herself throughout the film goes against some of the characteristics one would expect in a heroine. It also addresses the stereotype of the objectification of black women. Nelson George states that Pam Grier has been embraced by many [[feminism|feminists]] for her roles that not only display her beauty, but also her fearlessness and ability to exact retribution on men who challenge her.{{sfn|Sims|2006|p=76}}\n\n===Blaxploitation===\n[[Blaxploitation]] is a genre of exploitation films that usually targets the black audience in urban communities. Blaxploitation was very popular at the time this film was made after parts of the film industry saw untapped box-office potential in the black audience. The reputation of the blaxploitation film genre has shifted from low-budget black exploitation films to American classics worthy of deeper analysis. Although criticized for exploiting African-American culture, at the time, it provided one of the few ways for African-Americans to get into the film industry. Grier addressed this in an interview with ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' in 1979:\n<blockquote>\n\"Why would people think I would ever demean the Black woman? I was tried and convicted without being asked to testify in my defense. Sure, a lot of those films were junk. But they were what was being offered. They provided work for me and jobs for hundreds of Blacks. We all needed to work. We all needed to eat.\"{{sfn|Sims|2006|p=76}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Maternalism===\nIn ''Foxy Brown'' and ''[[Coffy]]'' (1973), the women share a distinct characteristic; they are nurturers. In each film, the plot surrounds justice for a loved one who was a victim of drug abuse, violence, and gang activity. Foxy wants revenge for her late boyfriend, Michael, and she also wants to shut down the drug and prostitute operation so they can no longer harm her community. Director Jack Hill made an obvious reference to [[Angela Davis]], the American activist, when she was talking to Black Caesar, and she demands they get justice for \"all of the people.\"{{Sfn|Sims|2006|p=237}} In ''Coffy'', Grier was seeking revenge against the drug underworld for her younger sister getting hooked on drugs, and now has to live in a rehabilitation home. In both films, the women risk their lives carrying out vigilant missions to make the streets a better place, but also, and more importantly, to avenge their family.\n\n===Women's power movement===\nThis movie spoke directly to the women's power movement and struggle in the 1970s. Despite criticism, Foxy was the poster child for a new type of heroine who was subsequently appropriated by the blaxploitation genre. She redefined African-American beauty, sexuality, and womanhood, which led to the diversification of African-American actresses onscreen. Grier said:\n<blockquote>\n\"The 1970s was a time of freedom and women saying that they needed empowerment. There was more empowerment and self-discovery than any other decade I remember. All across the country, a lot of women were ''Foxy Brown'' and ''Coffy''. They were independent, fighting to save their families not accepting rape or being victimized... This was going on all across the country. I just happened to do it on film. I don't think it took any great genius or great imagination. I just exemplified it, reflecting it to society.\"{{Sfn|Sims|2006|p=76}}</blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, ''Foxy Brown'' and ''Coffy'' show that women can stand up for themselves and for what they believe. The image of Foxy in an evening gown, well-equipped with a gun, is a visual representation of that idea that one does not have to be masculine to have power. \"Female power,\" according to Grier, is \"very different [from] male power, and a woman should maintain it always.\"{{Sfn|Sims|2006|p=76}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to director Jack Hill, due to tension between American International Pictures (AIP) and him, he was not invited to direct the sequel for ''[[Coffy]]'' until last minute. Tensions arose at a screening of a different film on which AIP had been working, which they were eager to show to Hill. Hill walked out, unimpressed, and AIP made a vow to never hire him again. AIP founder [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] reconciled with Hill, however, after the success of ''Coffy''.<ref name=\"Scarecrow Press, Inc\">{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=David|last2=Rausch|first2=Andrew|last3=Watson|first3=Chris|title=Reflections on Blaxploitation: Actors and Directors Speak|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=978-0-8108-6706-2|pages=237}}</ref>\n\n''Foxy Brown'' was originally intended to be a sequel to his ''Coffy'', also starring Pam Grier, and originally used the [[working title]] \"Burn, Coffy, Burn!\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 4, 2022 |title=Classic Corner: Foxy Brown |url=https://crookedmarquee.com/classic-corner-foxy-brown/ |access-date=April 20, 2022 |website=Crooked Marquee |language=en-US}}</ref> However, AIP decided at the last minute it did not want to do a sequel. Therefore, it is never said exactly what kind of job Foxy Brown has \u2013 \"Coffy\" was a nurse, and since this was no longer to be a sequel, they could not give Foxy Brown that job and did not have time to rewrite the script to establish just what kind of job she had.\n\nOn the audio commentary on the film's [[DVD]] release, Hill mentions that he was initially against the outfits that the wardrobe department chose for Foxy Brown. Since Pam Grier had become a star in ''Coffy'', an impetus existed to present the actress as even more stylish than she had appeared in the previous film. The 14 costumes were designed by a California couturier named Ruthie West, who was also the stylist for the [[The Jackson 5|Jackson 5]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], the Curtis Brothers, and [[Sisters Love]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Ida|title=Designer for \"Foxy Brown\"|publisher=The Baltimore Afro-American|date=October 6, 1973}}</ref> Hill, by his own account, though, initially felt that the outfits were too trendy and specific to the time period, and within a few years would cause the film to look dated and obsolete. In the years since the film's release, however, Hill has reversed his opinion on Foxy's clothes, particularly in the wake of not only ''Foxy Brown''{{'}}s ascent into pop culture icon, but also the '70s nostalgia movement that started in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Scarecrow Press, Inc\" /> Hill also mentioned that the character of Foxy Brown became something of a female empowerment symbol that seemed to transcend the time period of the film.\n\n==Reception==\n''Foxy Brown'' was a financial success. Produced on a budget of $500,000, it grossed $2,460,000.<ref name=\"sam\"/>\n\n[[A. H. Weiler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Grier was \"in a rut\" and \"fast becoming a bore despite all the sex, brawls and gore in 'Foxy Brown'\".<ref>Weiler, A. H. (April 6, 1974). \"Pam Grier Typed as 'Foxy Brown'\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 16.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that even by blaxploitation standards, the film is \"something of a mess.
