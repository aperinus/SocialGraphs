Unable to compete with modern entertainment, such as rock and roll, he plies his trade at smaller gatherings in bars, caf\u00e9s, and parties. He accepts the invitation of a drunken party patron to visit a remote Scottish island, where he entertains the locals. Staying in a room above the pub, he meets a girl, Alice, who is captivated by his illusions and kindness, including a gift of red shoes.\n\nAlice believes the downtrodden performer possesses genuine magical powers, and follows him to [[Edinburgh]], where he performs at a modest theatre. They share a room in a run-down guest house favoured by other fading performers. The illusionist sleeps on a couch and the girl keeps busy by cleaning and cooking food that she shares with the neighbours. The girl's affections even tame the rabbit, but the illusionist's increasingly meagre wages, spent on gifts for Alice, lead him to pawn his magic kit and secretly take on demeaning jobs.\n\nAlice attracts the affection of a handsome young man. After the illusionist sees them walking together, he leaves her with money and a note stating \"Magicians are not real\". He also releases the rabbit on [[Arthur's Seat]], where it soon meets other rabbits. As Alice moves in with her boyfriend, the illusionist departs on a train, where he declines an opportunity to perform a magic trick for a child.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to the 2006 reading of the script at the [[London Film School]] introduced by Chomet, \"The great French comic Jacques Tati wrote the script of ''The Illusionist'' and intended to make it as a live action film with his daughter\".<ref>[[London Film School]] (LFS), [http://www.lfs.org.uk/documents/scenario3leaflet.pdf Scenario 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084205/http://www.lfs.org.uk/documents/scenario3leaflet.pdf |date=11 May 2011 }}, 2005-12-19</ref> Catalogued in the [[Centre National de la Cin\u00e9matographie]] archives under the impersonal moniker \"Film Tati N\u00ba 4\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theplayground.co.uk/film/home.php?aID=297 |title=Tati meets Chomet in ''The Illusionist'' |publisher=Theplayground.co.uk |date=2012-05-28 |access-date=2012-06-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805110833/http://www.theplayground.co.uk/film/home.php?aID=297 |archive-date=5 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the script was passed to Chomet by the caretakers of Tati's oeuvre, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Deschamps]] and Macha Make\u00efeff after Chomet's previous film ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' was premiered at the 2003 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sylvain Chomet racconta The Illusionist |trans-title=Chomet tells ''The Illusionist'' |first=Antonio |last=Cuomo |url=http://www.movieplayer.it/eventi/articoli/sylvain-chomet-racconta-the-illusionist_6617/ |work=Movieplayer.it |language=it |date=17 February 2010 |access-date=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042808/http://www.movieplayer.it/eventi/articoli/sylvain-chomet-racconta-the-illusionist_6617/ |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Chomet has said that Tati's youngest daughter, [[Sophie Tatischeff]], had suggested an animated film when Chomet was seeking permission to use a clip from Tati's 1949 film ''[[Jour de f\u00eate]]'' as she did not want an actor to play her father.<ref name=\"Chomet's magic touch\"/> Sophie Tatischeff died on 27 October 2001, almost two years before the 11 June 2003 French release of ''The Triplets of Belleville''.\n\n===Animation===\nThe film was made at Chomet's [[Edinburgh]] film studio, [[Django Films]], by an international group of animators directed by Paul Dutton, including [[Sydney Padua]], Greg Manwaring and [[Jacques Muller (animator)|Jacques Muller]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775489/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 IMDB] Retrieved 6 November 2018</ref><ref name=\"Scots animation?

With McDonald being quoted saying \"My grandmother and all his stage acquaintances during the 1930s/40s always maintained that [Tati] was a great colleague as a friend and artist; he unfortunately just made a massive mistake that because of the time and circumstances he was never able to correctly address.

Mury compared it to the director's previous feature film: \"This ''Illusionist'' is as tender and contemplative as the ''Triplets'' were farcical and uneasy.
