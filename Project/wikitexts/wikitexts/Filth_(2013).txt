Baird]], based on [[Irvine Welsh]]'s 1998 novel ''[[Filth (novel)|Filth]]''. The film was released on 27 September 2013 in Scotland, 4 October 2013 elsewhere in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, and on 30 May 2014 in the United States.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1450321/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt {{better source needed|date=October 2017}}</ref> It stars [[James McAvoy]], [[Jamie Bell]], and [[Jim Broadbent]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Detective Sergeant]] Bruce Robertson, a scheming, manipulative, [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] bully, spends his free time indulging in drugs, alcohol, abusive sexual relationships, and \"the games\" \u2014 his euphemism for vindictive plots he hatches to cause trouble for people he dislikes, including many of his colleagues in the [[Edinburgh]] police force.\n\nBruce also delights in bullying and taking advantage of his mild-mannered friend Clifford Blades, a member of Bruce's [[Freemasonry|masonic]] lodge, whose wife, Bunty, is the target of his repeated [[obscene phone call]]s. He only shows genuine warmth to Mary and her young son, the widowed wife and child of a man whom he tries and fails to resuscitate after he suffers a heart attack in the street.\n\nAs the story begins, Bruce's main goal is to gain a promotion to become [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Inspector]], the path to which appears to open when he is assigned to oversee the investigation into the murder of a [[Japan]]ese exchange student. However, Bruce slowly loses his grip on reality as he works the case and has more and more vivid hallucinations.\n\nIt is ultimately revealed through dream-like exchanges with Dr. Rossi, Bruce's psychiatrist, that he is on medication for [[bipolar disorder]] and has repressed immense feelings of guilt over a childhood accident that led to the death of his younger brother. We learn his wife Carole has left him and is denying him access to his daughter Stacey.\n\nThese domestic issues sparked his desperate bid for promotion, played a part in his unusual displays of kindness toward Mary and her son, and have also led him to start cross-dressing as his wife when off duty in order to \"keep her close\" to him.\n\nWhile wandering the streets on such an occasion, Bruce is kidnapped by a street gang led by the thuggish Gorman \u2014 who are responsible for the murder \u2014 and badly beaten. However, he manages to kill Gorman by [[defenestration|throwing him through a window]] and is found by his colleagues. Bruce not only misses out on the promotion as a result of the events, but is in fact demoted to [[Constable#United Kingdom|Constable]] and is reassigned to uniform, while rookie Ray Lennox is promoted to Detective Inspector.\n\nAfterwards, Blades receives a tape of Bruce apologising. Bruce then prepares to commit suicide by hanging, but is interrupted at the last moment by Mary and her son knocking at his front door. He then breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience repeating his catchphrase \u2014 \"same rules apply\" \u2014 and laughs as the chair slips from under him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Bruce \"Robbo\" Robertson\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Ray Lennox\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Clifford Blades\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Amanda Drummond\n* [[Brian McCardie]] as Dougie Gillman\n* [[Emun Elliott]] as Peter Inglis\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Gus Bain\n* [[John Sessions]] as Bob Toal\n* [[Shauna Macdonald (Scottish actress)|Shauna Macdonald]] as Carole Robertson\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Dr. Verme Rossi\n* [[Joanne Froggatt]] as Mary\n* [[Kate Dickie]] as Chrissie Gillman\n* [[Martin Compston]] as Graeme Gorman\n* [[Iain De Caestecker]] as Ocky\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Bunty Blades\n* Joy McAvoy as Estelle\n* Jordan Young as Lexo\n* [[Pollyanna McIntosh]] as Karen\n* Bobby Rainsbury as Stephanie\n* Zack Niizato as Japanese Student\n* Therese Bradley as Madame Maisie\n* [[Robin Laing]] as Rent Boy\n* Franziska Altmeyer as Hamburg Carole\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Hector\n* [[Tracy-Ann Oberman]] as Diana\n* Mitchell Mullen as Bobby\n* Jake Wilson as Davie Robertson\n* Luke MacDonald as Euan\n* [[David Soul]] as Punter\n* [[Natasha O'Keeffe]] as Anna\n* Chidi Chickwe as Steven\n* [[Sanjeev Kohli]] as Sunil\n* Neil D'Souza as Anil\n* [[Trudie Styler]] as Madame R Zen Ficken\n* Megan Finn as Stacey Robertson\n}}\n\n==Production==\nWelsh's novel was published in 1998, but over the following years the project was passed between producers and acquired a reputation of being \"un-filmable\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/irvine-welsh-the-unfilmable-filth-finally-makes-it-to-the-big-screen-8807321.html |title=Irvine Welsh: The 'unfilmable' Filth finally makes it to the big screen |first=Matt |last=Ford |work=[[The Independent]] |date=11 September 2013 |access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n===Track listing<ref>{{Cite web|title=Filth Soundtrack (2013)|url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/filth/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=www.soundtrack.net}}</ref>===\n{{Track listing\n|collapsed=no\n|extra_column   = Artist(s)\n|title1         = Robbo's Theme\n|extra1         = [[Clint Mansell]]\n|length1        = 1:14\n|title2         = [[Will You Love Me Tomorrow|Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]\n|extra2         = [[The Shirelles]]\n|length2        = 0:17\n|title3         = [[Love Really Hurts Without You]]\n|extra3         = [[Billy Ocean]]\n|length3        = 2:42\n|title4         = [[Silver Lady (song)|Silver Lady]]\n|extra4         = [[David Soul]]\n|length4        = 3:00\n|title5         = It's All Over Me\n|extra5         = [[Otis Blackwell]]\n|length5        = 3:43\n|title6         = Born To Be Wild\n|extra6         = [[Wilson Pickett]]\n|length6        = 2:44\n|title7         = Supermarket Emptiness\n|extra7         = [[Clint Mansell]]\n|length7        = 0:37\n|title8         = [[Creep (Radiohead song)#Cover versions|Creep]]\n|extra8         = Clint Mansell & Coco Sumner\n|length8        = 2:07\n|title9         = Dr Love\n|extra9         = [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]\n|length9        = 4:12\n|title10        = Mercy\n|extra10        = The Third Degree\n|length10       = 1:51\n|title11        = Backdoor Santa\n|extra11        = [[Clarence Carter]]\n|length11       = 3:20\n|total_length   = 25:47\n}}Other notable pieces include<ref>{{Citation|title=All 170 songs from the Filth (2013) Soundtrack|url=https://www.what-song.com/Movies/Soundtrack/1318/Filth|language=en|access-date=2021-05-29}}</ref>\n\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|''Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67: I.
