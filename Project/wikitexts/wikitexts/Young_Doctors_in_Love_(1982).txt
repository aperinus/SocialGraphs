Over time he seems to develop feelings for 'her', not knowing it's Sal's son in disguise.  \n\nResidents Dr. Stephanie Brody and Dr. Simon August develop a relationship as the film progresses. Out to dinner, she has a strong pain in her side, but shakes it off, insisting it's nothing. \n\nAs Dr. Phil Burns is working two other jobs to afford the residency, he's half-asleep when a dirty note is passed to him by head Nurse Norine Sprockett. Taken from a patient, Phil mistakens it as a come on. When he makes a pass at her, Norine slaps him. As a way of apologizing, he shows her the fox step, as his second job is as a dance instructor. Phil discovers Norine wears the key to the medications cabinet around her neck when he convinces her to get him an upper. \n\nDr. Prang tells Simon he will schedule him for a basic surgery, and when he's asked to perform an appendoctomy he chokes. He has a flashback to a joke played on him with a pi\u00f1ata on his birthday. Stephanie makes love to him on the operating table in the operating theater to cure him of his panic of the room.\n\nMonths pass, Sal continues to thwart Malamud's assassination attempts. At the hospital Christmas party, Stephanie and Simon announce their engagement and she collapses shortly afterwards. It's discovered that she is afflicted with a condition requiring a labor-intensive procedure. Simon forces a reluctant Dr. Prang to go ahead with the operation.\nAs it's complicated, the surgeons practise on a dummy.\n\nIn the meantime Phil, who's greatly increased a pill pushing business he's started by stealing using a copy of the medicine cabinet key, gets nabbed by the police. Norine had tipped them off once she'd discovered he'd been robbing the hospital. \n\nStephanie's operation is scheduled, but at the last minute both the nurses go on strike and Dr. Prang loses it after his accountant says that he has to declare bankruptcy. Simon must operate without him, using his fellow residents as support.  \n\nAfter some scares, the operation is ultimately a success.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sean Young]] as Dr. Stephanie Brody\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Dr. Simon August\n* Gary Friedkin as Dr. Milton Chamberlain\n* [[Kyle T.
