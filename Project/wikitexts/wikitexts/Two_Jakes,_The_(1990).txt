Reprising their roles from ''Chinatown'' are [[Joe Mantell]], [[Perry Lopez]], [[James Hong]], and, in a brief voice-over, [[Faye Dunaway]]. The musical score for the film is by [[Van Dyke Parks]], who also appears as a prosecuting attorney. The screenplay is by [[Robert Towne]], whose script for ''Chinatown'' won an Academy Award.\n\n''The Two Jakes'' faced a troubled production and went through several years of [[development hell]]. Various actors were attached at several points, including [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Roy Scheider]], with screenwriter Towne also at one point set to direct and producer Evans set to co-star. Filming finally took place with Nicholson at the helm, filming around Los Angeles in the early summer of 1989. The film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on August 10, 1990. The film received mixed reviews and was not a box office success and plans for a third film about J. J. Gittes, with him near the end of his life, were abandoned.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1948 Los Angeles, businessman Julius \"Jake\" Berman hires seasoned [[private investigator]] J. J. \"Jake\" Gittes to catch his wife, Kitty, committing adultery. During the sting, Berman unexpectedly kills his wife's lover, Mark Bodine, who is also his partner in a real estate development company. Gittes, unaware of this, suddenly finds himself being scrutinized for his role in what appears to be a premeditated murder; the key piece of evidence is the [[wire recording]] that Gittes set up. It audio taped the illicit encounter, the confrontation, and Bodine being killed. However, the audio makes it unclear whether Berman intended to kill Bodine before confronting him, making it murder, or if the killing was a spontaneous act of jealousy, possibly qualifying as \"temporary insanity\", which is a defense of murder.\n\nGittes is forced to convince his old acquaintance, LAPD Captain Lou Escobar, that he should not be charged as an accomplice. Oddly, Berman seems unconcerned that he may be charged with murder. Gittes has the recording, which Berman's attorney, Cotton Weinberger, and mobster friend Mickey Nice, both want and is locked in a safe in Gittes L.A. office.\n\nEarthquakes have recently rocked the area, including Berman's housing development in the Valley. Gittes is nearly killed in a gas explosion, waking to find Berman and Kitty standing over him.\n\nGittes has a confrontation, and a later sexual encounter, with Lilian Bodine, the dead man's angry widow. He is presented with proof that Earl Rawley, a wealthy and ruthless oil man, may be drilling under the Bodine and Berman development, though Rawley denies doing so. Gittes focuses his attention on determining who owns the mineral rights to the land. Gittes eventually discovers the rights are owned by Katherine Mulwray, daughter of the late Evelyn Mulwray, his love interest from eleven years prior. He also discovers that the deed transfers were executed in a manner to attempt to hide Katherine Mulwray's prior ownership and continued claim of the mineral rights. Furthermore, he also discovers that Katherine's father (and grandfather) Noah Cross, has since died and left her all his financial assets.\n\nGittes receives word from his associates that Berman has been seen with a blond woman, along with Mickey and a bodyguard. Gittes determines that the woman is an oncologist and is treating Berman for cancer. Gittes confronts Berman with this knowledge and gets a full confession: his cancer is terminal and will die soon. He has taken steps to ensure that Kitty will be financially secure once he dies.\n\nTo persuade Kitty to talk to him, Gittes works to prove that her husband did set out to kill his partner. Once accomplished, Kitty agrees to meet Gittes and tell him what she knows about Berman. In the process of discussing Berman's possible motivations, mineral rights, and the possible whereabouts of Katherine, it is revealed that Kitty and Katherine are the same person. Kitty reveals that she never suspected that her husband was dying.\n\nGittes holds onto the recording, refusing to let anyone hear it until the inquest. Gittes edits the recording, omitting Kitty's name and making other alterations to indicate Bodine's death was not premeditated. The court quickly drops all charges against Berman. Realizing Gittes is aware of his terminal illness and knowing the model house he is in is filling with [[natural gas]], Berman asks Gittes and Mickey to leave so he can \"have a smoke.\" As they drive off, the house explodes. With no remains left to recover, the police make no attempt to investigate his death and Kitty inherits a substantial sum from her late husband.\n\nThe story ends with Kitty and Gittes in his office. They speak of regrets, and Kitty kisses Gittes, who rejects her advances. She leaves, telling him to occasionally think of her. Gittes responds that the past never goes away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[J.

Producer [[Robert Evans]] had the rights to a ''Chinatown'' sequel, and in 1976 had negotiated for Jack Nicholson to reprise his role and [[Dustin Hoffman]] to act alongside him; that version eventually fell through.<ref name=AFI2020>{{cite web |url= https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58726 |title= Catalog - The Two Jakes |website= [[American Film Institute]] |access-date= August 19, 2020 |archive-date= May 10, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210510235925/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58726 |url-status= live}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Robert Towne]] finished the script for ''The Two Jakes'' in 1984 and was set to direct, but he objected to Evans's wish to act in the film in the Jake Berman role. Nicholson, Evans, and Towne had formed their own production company to make the film independently, and entered into a distribution deal with [[Paramount Pictures]]. The trio agreed to not take up-front salaries, and instead share in the film's profits. Paramount greenlit a $12\u201313 million budget, and capped its distribution fee at $6 million.\n\nIn April 1985, [[Kelly McGillis]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Joe Pesci]], and [[Harvey Keitel]] had all been cast, ready to shoot the film that month.<ref name=FalkAugust2020>{{cite news |url= https://news.yahoo.com/crazy-story-chinatown-sequel-the-two-jakes-061922441.html |title= The crazy story behind the making of 'Chinatown' sequel 'The Two Jakes' |first= Ben |last= Falk |website= [[Yahoo!

Filming was scheduled to begin four days after the confrontation, with a witness telling ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'': \"In the morning, nothing happened. They said the weather was wrong. But you could tell the plug had been pulled\".<ref name=FalkAugust2020/> On top of existing problems between Nicholson, Towne, and Evans, grievances were filed by 120 crew members who had not been paid (over $500,000 from [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Directors Guild of America]] members, and $1.5 million from suppliers of sets, props, costumes, and sound stages), and the project was officially postponed indefinitely.<ref name=AFI2020/>\n\nBecause the film hadn't been budgeted normally due to the initial Evans\u2013Towne\u2013Nicholson plan, Towne approached producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to help finance. McGillis remained in the cast, with [[Harrison Ford]] set to take over as Jake Gittes and [[Roy Scheider]] attached to play the other Jake, with a tentative start date of mid-1986. At one point the original film's star [[John Huston]] was rumored to be brought in as director, although Towne denied the claim. However, the constant shuffling worried Paramount, who withdrew from the distribution deal out of nervousness, eventually taking a $4 million loss on the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-30-8503140417-story.html |title=In Vanity Fair: The Saga of Why a 'Chinatown' Sequel Never Got Made |first=James |last=Warren |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1985-10-30 |access-date=2019-03-03 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043739/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-30-8503140417-story.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Briefly, [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] tried to buy the film for financing after Paramount Pictures had tried to put the film into turnaround, only for Cannon to lose the rights, and it would eventually be reverted to Paramount.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jjgittes|date=2017-07-08|title=JJ Gittes Investigations: The Two Jakes: Take 2|url=http://j-j-gittes.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-two-jakes-take-2.html|access-date=2022-01-29|website=JJ Gittes Investigations}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=1986-05-14|title=Cannon Slate Includes 'Field' Pic; Revived 'Jakes' With Nicholson|page=26|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> The project was discontinued until the late 1980s when Nicholson took on the responsibility of directing and also rewrote parts of Towne's script (which \"was really only about 80% ready\").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-05-et-secondlook5-story.html |title=Some respect for 'The Two Jakes' |first=Dennis |last=Lim |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2007-11-05 |access-date=2019-03-03 |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212215847/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-nov-05-et-secondlook5-story.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Filming began in [[Los Angeles]] on April 18, 1989, lasting through July 26.<ref name=AFI2020/> Numerous scenes had to be reshot after initial filming had wrapped, causing the release date to get pushed from Christmas 1989 to its August 1990 date.
