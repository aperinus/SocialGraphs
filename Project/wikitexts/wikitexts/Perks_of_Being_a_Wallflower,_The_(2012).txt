[[Logan Lerman]] stars as a teenager named Charlie who writes to an unnamed friend, and these epistles chronicle his trials, tribulations, and triumphs as he goes through his freshman year of high school. The film depicts his struggles with his, unbeknownst to him, [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], as he goes through his journey in high school making new friends, portrayed by [[Emma Watson]] and [[Ezra Miller]]. The film's [[ensemble cast]] also includes [[Mae Whitman]], [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Nina Dobrev]] and [[Paul Rudd]] in supporting roles.\n\nChbosky had always intended to adapt the novel to film, but did not rush to do so. He was hesitant to sell the rights to the film to anyone, but eventually sold them to [[Mr. Mudd|Mr. Mudd Productions]] as long as they let him write and direct the film. Filming began in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, in May 2011 and lasted approximately fifty days.<ref name=\"mojo\" /><ref name=\"Stephen\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/09/catching-up-with-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-a.html|title=Catching Up With ''The Perks of Being A Wallflower''|date=September 27, 2012|publisher=Paste.com|access-date=September 29, 2012|archive-date=August 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814140932/https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/catching-up-with-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-a/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/tag/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-filming-locations-may-9-may-13 |title='Perks Of Being A Wallflower' updates plus filming locations in Pittsburgh May 9\u201313 |access-date=May 12, 2011 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003225027/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/tag/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-filming-locations-may-9-may-13/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmawatson.com/en/Latest/Emma/A-message-from-Emma |title=A message from Emma |work=EmmaWatson.com |access-date=May 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509192309/http://www.emmawatson.com/en/Latest/Emma/A-message-from-Emma/ |archive-date=May 9, 2011  }}</ref>\n\n''The Perks of Being a Wallflower'' had its world premiere at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2012, to a standing ovation.

Uneasy about beginning his freshman year of high school, he is shy and has difficulty making friends. Charlie does connect with his English teacher, Mr. Anderson.\n\nCharlie meets two seniors, Sam and her maternal stepbrother Patrick, at a football game. After the homecoming dance Sam and Patrick invite him to a party. He unknowingly eats a [[Cannabis edible|weed brownie]], gets high and discloses to Sam that the year before, his best friend committed suicide. He also walks in on Patrick and Brad, the high school quarterback, kissing. Patrick tells Charlie that Brad is [[closeted]], so he agrees to keep it a secret.\n\nSam realizes that Charlie has no other friends, so she and Patrick bring Charlie into their group. On their way home the three hear an unknown song on the radio. Sam instructs Patrick to drive through a tunnel, so she can stand up in the back of the pickup while the music blasts.\n\nSam needs to improve her SAT scores to have a better chance of being accepted to [[Pennsylvania State University]], so Charlie offers to tutor her, which improves her scores. At Christmas, she gives him a vintage typewriter to thank him. They discuss relationships, and Charlie reveals he has never been kissed. Sam reveals that her first kiss was at age 11 by her father's boss. He reveals that his Aunt Helen was also sexually assaulted as a child but claims that she was \"able to turn her life around\". Sam tells Charlie she wants his first kiss to be from someone who loves him, and kisses him.\n\nAt a regular ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' performance, Charlie is asked to fill in for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who is not there. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks him to the [[Sadie Hawkins dance]], and they enter into an unsatisfactory relationship. At a party, when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, he chooses Sam, upsetting both her and Mary Elizabeth. Patrick tells Charlie to stay away from the group for a while; the isolation causes him to sink back into depression. He experiences flashbacks of his Aunt Helen, who died in a car accident on his seventh birthday.\n\nBrad shows up to school with bruises on his face after being caught by his father having sex with Patrick. Brad claims he was jumped and beaten up, and distances himself from Patrick, calling him a \"faggot.\" In anger, Patrick punches him, causing him to retaliate. Brad's friends begin beating Patrick, preventing Sam from intervening, but Charlie forcefully intervenes, then blacks out. Upon recovering, he finds he has bruised knuckles and Brad's friends are incapacitated. Sam and Patrick express their gratitude to Charlie, and the three become friends again.\n\nPatrick tries to cope with what happened with Brad, and at one point kisses Charlie, but immediately apologizes. Charlie's mental state quickly worsens after the blackout. Sam is accepted into Penn State, and breaks up with Craig on prom night after learning he is cheating on her. The night before she departs, she brings Charlie to her room. They confide in each other and kiss, but when Sam touches Charlie's thigh, he experiences a momentary flashback of his Aunt Helen, which he passes off as nothing, and they continue kissing.\n\nAfter Sam leaves for college in the morning, Charlie's emotional state deteriorates and his flashbacks worsen. He calls his sister, blaming himself for Helen's death, and admits he may have wanted it to happen. His sister realizes he is in distress and calls the police. Charlie passes out as they burst through the door and comes to in a hospital, where psychiatrist Dr. Burton brings out his [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]], revealing that his aunt sexually abused him as a child.\n\nThe night Charlie is released from the hospital, he is visited by Sam and Patrick. Sam explains what college life is like, and that she has found \"The Tunnel Song\" \u2013 \"[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]\" by [[David Bowie]]. The three revisit the tunnel, where Charlie kisses Sam again, and he stands up in the back of the truck. He acknowledges that he feels alive and in that moment \u2013 \"We are infinite\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as Charlie Kelmeckis\n* [[Emma Watson]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Button\n* [[Ezra Miller]] as Patrick Stewart\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Mary Elizabeth\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Mr. Anderson<!-- In the film, Mr. Anderson's given name, Bill, is never revealed. -->, Charlie's English teacher\n* [[Nina Dobrev]] as Candace Kelmeckis, Charlie's sister\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Brad Hayes\n* [[Erin Wilhelmi]] as Alice\n* Adam Hagenbuch as Bob\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] as Mrs. Kelmeckis\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Mr. Kelmeckis\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Helen, Charlie's aunt\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Dr. Burton\n* [[Zane Holtz]] as Chris Kelmeckis, Charlie's older brother\n* [[Reece Thompson]] as Craig, Sam's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Ponytail Derek, Candace's boyfriend\n* [[Landon Pigg]] as Peter\n* [[Tom Savini]] as Mr. Callahan\n* [[Julia Garner]] as Susan\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Stephen Chbosky, Jericho Panel at Comic Con SD 2006 cropped.jpg|thumb|175px|left|alt=Smiling man, seated at a table|Stephen Chbosky at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n\nChbosky incorporated both fictional ideas and personal experiences into the novel.<ref name=lay>{{cite news|last=Beisch|first=Ann|title=Interview with Stephen Chbosky, author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower|url=http://www.layouth.com/interview-with-stephen-chbosky-author-of-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower/|access-date=May 15, 2013|newspaper=LA Youth|date=December 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215225037/http://www.layouth.com/interview-with-stephen-chbosky-author-of-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower/|archive-date=February 15, 2011}}</ref> After five years with these elements in mind,<ref name=lay/> he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life.<ref name=blue/> He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own,<ref name=blue>{{cite web|title=Interview With Perks of Being a Wallflower's Stephen Chbosky|url=http://blueprintonline.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/interview-with-perks-of-being.html|author=Stewart, Sierra|publisher=Blueprint Magazine Online|date=September 18, 2012|access-date=December 22, 2017|archive-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721221702/http://blueprintonline.blogspot.com/2012/09/interview-with-perks-of-being.html|url-status=live}}</ref> which led him to ask, \"Why do good people let themselves get treated so badly?\"<ref name=complex>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/09/interview-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-director-stephen-chbosky|title=Interview: \"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\" Director Stephen Chbosky Talks Finding The Perfect Cast And Changing Teens' Lives|date=September 22, 2012|author=Aquino, Tara|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|access-date=September 7, 2014|archive-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721192426/https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/09/interview-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-director-stephen-chbosky|url-status=live}}</ref> The author tried to answer the question with the sentence \"we accept the love we think we deserve\".
