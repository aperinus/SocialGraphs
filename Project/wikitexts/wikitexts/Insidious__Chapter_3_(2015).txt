The film stars [[Dermot Mulroney]] and [[Stefanie Scott]], with [[Angus Sampson]], Whannell, and [[Lin Shaye]] reprising their roles from the previous films.\n\nBy September 2013, a third installment in the Insidious series was announced, with Whannell signed on to return as writer and [[Jason Blum]] and [[Oren Peli]] set to produce. [[Screen Rant]] reported that the third film would not focus on the Lamberts, but on a new family and story, and would not connect to the last scene in the second film. [[Principal photography]] began on July 9, 2014, in [[Los Angeles]] under the title \"Into The Further\", on a scheduled 29-day shoot. Filming wrapped on August 18, 2014.\n\nThe film was released on June 5, 2015, received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $113 million against a budget of $11 million.

The word count for a plot summary is between 400 and 700 words. -->\nSeveral years before [[Insidious (film)|the Lambert haunting]], teenager Quinn Brenner meets with retired [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier.  Elise reluctantly agrees to try and contact the spirit of Quinn's mother, Lily, who died one year prior. However, Elise urges Quinn not to try and contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force.  After auditioning for a school for the performing arts, Quinn sees a mysterious figure waving to her from the distance on the street. Distracted, she is hit by a car, having both of her legs broken in the process.\n\nNow stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an oxygen mask known as the \"Man Who Can't Breathe\"\u2014the same figure that caused her accident.  One of Quinn's neighbors, an elderly woman with [[dementia]] who had previously said several confusing and cryptic things to her about the \"Man Who Can't Breathe\", passes away.\n\nSean meets with Elise, who like him is also grieving after the death of her husband Jack, and tries to convince her to help his daughter.  Elise declines, stating that her previous visits to the dark spiritual world of the \"Further\" made her realize that an evil spirit is hunting her. However, she is convinced by her friend and former colleague Carl to continue using her spiritual ability, after he reminds her about her successful [[Insidious: Chapter 2|case involving Josh Lambert]] in 1986, and stating that she is stronger than any spirits or demons because she is living and they are not.\n\nDue to Elise's refusal, Alex suggests Sean call on alleged demonologists Specs and Tucker, who have built a following on the [[internet]]. During their investigation, Quinn becomes briefly possessed by the \"Man Who Can't Breathe,\" breaks through her leg braces, and attempts to attack Sean, Specs, and Tucker. Sean realizes Specs and Tucker are [[confidence trick|frauds]], and prepares to kick the duo out until Elise arrives. Deducing that the dark spirit's goal is to lure potential victims to \"The Further\" so it can eat their life force, Elise decides to enter the spiritual world, and enlists Specs and Tucker to help.\n\nElise enters the Further and has a brief fight with the evil spirit that haunts her (a mysterious [[Insidious: Chapter 2|\"Bride in Black\"]]), before she discovers Jack's spirit. Jack begins to encourage Elise to commit [[suicide]] so that they might be reunited. Elise realizes that Jack is actually the \"Man Who Can't Breathe\" in disguise and slashes his face and orders it to release Quinn. Quinn arrives crawling on the floor. Elise pushes the entity away grabs her and runs back, but eventually gets attacked by the entity just before she could escape back to the physical world. Elise manages to overpower the entity, and takes Quinn back and enters the real world, before the spirit grabs hold of her. Elise realizes that Quinn has to defeat him on her own. Though Quinn is at first at a disadvantage, Elise receives a message from the recently dead neighbor: Lily had left Quinn a letter to read before she graduated High School, but Quinn never found it. Lily's spirit suddenly appears in the Further and helps her defeat the \"Man Who Can't Breathe.\" Elise gives parting words to the family, including words of encouragement from Lily's spirit. She leaves with Specs and Tucker, and the three agree to form a partnership.\n\nElise arrives home happy that she could go on with her work, but then her dog barks at what seems to be a ghost. Suddenly, a demon with a red face pops up behind her unaware.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Elise Rainier\n* [[Stefanie Scott]] as Quinn Brenner\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Sean Brenner\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as Tucker\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Specs\n* [[Hayley Kiyoko]] as Maggie\n* Tate Berney as Alex Brenner\n* Michael Reid MacKay as \"The Man Who Can't Breathe\"\n* [[Tom Gallop]] as Dr. Henderson\n* Steve Coulter as Carl\n* Phyllis Applegate as Grace\n* Ashton Moio as Hector\n* [[Ele Keats]] as Lily Brenner\n* Tom Fitzpatrick as Bride in Black / Parker Crane\n* Adrian Sparks as Jack Rainier\n* Phil Abrams as Mel\n* Ruben Garfias as Ernesto\n* Amaris Davidson as Nurse\n* Garrett Ryan as Young Josh Lambert\n* [[Joseph Bishara]] as Lipstick-Face Demon\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Insidious premiere.jpg|thumb|Premiere at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] (June 4, 2015)]]\nOn September 15, 2013, a third installment in the ''Insidious'' series was announced, with [[Leigh Whannell]] signed on to return as writer, and [[Jason Blum]] and [[Oren Peli]] set to produce.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=''INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER THREE'' Moving Forward; Leigh Whannell Returning to Write the Script|url=https://collider.com/insidious-3-sequel-leigh-whannell|publisher=Collider.com|access-date=September 16, 2013|date=September 16, 2013}}</ref> When asked about returning for another sequel, actor [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] went on to say that he \"[doesn't] know where else it could go\", and that \"[Josh Lambert has] been through the wringer, and I think the movie sets it up well at the end [...] And that's great, that's how it should end.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|title=Patrick Wilson On Why There Won't Be an ''Insidious 3'' and His Love for ''Conjuring'' Director James Wan|url=https://indiewire.com/article/patrick-wilson-on-why-there-wont-be-an-insidious-3-and-his-love-for-director-james-wan?page=2#articleHeaderPanel|work=[[Indiewire]]|access-date=September 16, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}</ref> On November 13, 2013, it was announced [[Focus Features]] and [[Stage 6 Films]] would release the film on April 3, 2015.
