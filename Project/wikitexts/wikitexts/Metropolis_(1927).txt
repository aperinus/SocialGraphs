It was cut substantially after its German premiere. Many attempts have been made since the 1970s to restore the film. In 1984, Italian music producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists including [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Loverboy]], and [[Adam Ant]]. In 2001, a new reconstruction of ''Metropolis'' was shown at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. In 2008, a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in [[Argentina]]. Per the opening explanation:  \"...The material was heavily damaged and, because it had been printed on 16mm film stock, does not have the full-aperture silent picture ratio. ...In order to maintain the scale of the restored footage, the missing portion of the frame appears black. Black frames indicate points at which footage is still lost.\"  After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from [[New Zealand]], the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\n\n''Metropolis'' is now widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]], ranking 35th in ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s [[The Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2012#Critics' poll|2012 critics' poll]].<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite news| url= https://www2.bfi.org.uk/greatest-films-all-time | title= The Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time | date= September 2012| newspaper= [[Sight & Sound]] | publisher= [[British Film Institute]]| access-date=19 December 2012}}</ref> In 2001, the film was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]], the first film thus distinguished.<ref>Staff (ndg) [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/metropolis-sicherungsstueck-nr-1-negative-of-the-restored-and-reconstructed-version-2001/ \"Memory of the World: Metropolis \u2013 Sicherungsst\u00fcck Nr. 1: Negative of the restored and reconstructed version 2001\"] [[UNESCO]] website.

Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son, Freder, idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich \"brothers\". Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder becomes fascinated by her and goes to the lower levels to find her. In the machine halls, he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is a temple of [[Moloch]] and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident.\n\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen fires his assistant Josaphat for not being the first to bring him details about the explosion or the maps. After seeing his father's cold indifference towards the harsh conditions faced by the workers, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat's assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker who has collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nFredersen takes the maps to the inventor [[Rotwang]] to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a [[Maschinenmensch|robot]] he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he can fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can discredit her among the workers, but is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to destroy Metropolis and ruin both Fredersen and Freder. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent among the workers.\n\nFreder recovers and returns to the catacombs, accompanied by Josaphat. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, he accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine halls, leaving their children behind. They destroy the machines, triggering a flood in their city deeper underground. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with help from Freder and Josaphat. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang becomes delusional, seeing the real Maria as his lost Hel, and chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street, and Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alfred Abel]] as Joh Fredersen, the master of Metropolis\n* [[Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich]] as Freder, Joh Fredersen's son\n* [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]] as [[Rotwang]], the inventor\n* [[Fritz Rasp]] as The Thin Man, Fredersen's spy\n* [[Theodor Loos]] as Josaphat, Fredersen's assistant and Freder's friend\n* [[Erwin Biswanger]] as 11811, a worker, also known as Georgy\n* [[Heinrich George]] as Grot, guardian of the Heart Machine\n* [[Brigitte Helm]] as Maria / [[Maschinenmensch|The Machine Man]]{{notetag|In the film's opening credits, several characters appear in the cast list without the names of the actors who play them: The Creative Man, The Machine Man, Death, and The Seven Deadly Sins.

In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that \"the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924\". He had visited [[New York City]] for the first time and remarked \"I looked into the streets\u2014the glaring lights and the tall buildings\u2014and there I conceived ''Metropolis'',\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}} although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year.<ref name=bennett /> Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that \"the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize\".{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=69}} He added \"The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...\"{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=4}}\n\nThe appearance of the city in ''Metropolis'' is strongly informed by the [[Art Deco]] movement; however it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in ''Metropolis'' as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both \"functionalist modernism [and] art deco\" whilst also featuring \"the scientist's archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral\". The film's use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style's subsequent popularity in Europe and America.{{sfn|Russell|2007|p=111}} The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in [[Pozna\u0144]] fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.<ref>[https://gloswielkopolski.pl/minely-92-lata-od-pierwszych-targow-poznanskich-zobacz-co-po-nich-zostalo-unikalne-zdjecia/ga/905839/zd/1997127 Upper Silesian Tower, Pozna\u0144 on 1911 postcard]</ref>\n\nLang's visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made than anything they had made before. Despite UFA's growing debt, Lang announced that ''Metropolis'' would be \"the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.\"<ref name=bennett />\n\nThe film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the [[Tower of Babel]] to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the [[Whore of Babylon]], riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.\n\nThe name of the [[Yoshiwara]] club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.{{Sfn|White|1995|p=348}}\n\nMuch of the plot line of ''Metropolis'' stems from the [[World War I|First World War]] and the culture of the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in ''Metropolis'' include the Weimar view of American modernity, [[fascism]], and [[communism]].<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Shell Shock Cinema: Weimar Culture and the Wounds of War\n| last = Kaes\n| first = Anton\n| publisher = Princeton University Press\n| year = 2009\n| isbn = 978-0-691-03136-1\n| location = Princeton, New Jersey\n}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n''Metropolis''<nowiki/>'s screenplay was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in Weimar Germany, jointly with Lang, her then-husband.{{sfn|Magid|2006|p=129}}{{sfn|Grant|2003|p=14}} The film's plot originated from a [[Metropolis (novel)|novel of the same title]] written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s works and other German dramas.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=9}} The novel featured strongly in the film's marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal ''Illustriertes Blatt'' in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements\u2014including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel\u2014were dropped.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od. 1924 crop2.jpg|thumb|left|Lang and Harbou in their Berlin apartment in 1923 or 1924, about the time they were working on the scenario for ''Metropolis'']]\nThe screenplay itself went through many rewrites, and at one point featured an ending where Freder flew to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang's ''[[Woman in the Moon]]''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}} The time setting of ''Metropolis'' is open to interpretation.

Meanwhile, the 1963 Ace Books edition which reprints the 1927 English edition specifies the setting as \"The World of 2026 A.D.\"\n\n===Filming===\n''Metropolis'' began [[principal photography]] on 22 May 1925 with an initial budget of {{Reichsmark|1.5 million}}.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}} Lang cast two unknowns with little film experience in the lead roles. Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on ''Metropolis'' before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang.{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=113}} Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', but would make her feature film debut with ''Metropolis''.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=12}} In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''. Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Destiny]]'', ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'', and ''Die Nibelungen''.\n\nShooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the workers' city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of [[Berlin]] had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fr\u00f6hlich found he could barely stand.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}} Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the workers' city.{{sfn|Minden|Bachmann|2002|p=16}}<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Frank|title=Metropolis (1927)|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|publisher=[[TCM.com]]|access-date=23 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316012144/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/25817%7C0/Metropolis.html|archive-date=16 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that \"the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments\u2014even if we did follow Fritz Lang's directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time\u2014I can't forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn't easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn't fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn't get enough air.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Helm|first=Brigitte |title=The Making of Metropolis: Actress Brigitte Helm \u2013 The Maria of the Underworld, of Yoshiwara, and I |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/the-making-of-metropolis-actress-brigitte-helm/ |work=[[Cinefantastique]]|access-date=23 February 2012 |editor-first=Lawrence |editor-last=French |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709020834/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/the-making-of-metropolis-actress-brigitte-helm/|archive-date=9 July 2014|date=15 May 2010}}</ref> \n \nBut it wasn't just suffering.

Considering that ''Metropolis'' was too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright [[Channing Pollock (writer)|Channing Pollock]] to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel, because the name sounded too similar to the English word [[Hell]], thereby removing Rotwang's original motivation for creating his robot. Pollock said about the original film that it was \"symbolism run such riot that people who saw it couldn't tell what the picture was about. ...

Hugenberg had the film cut down to a length of 3,241 metres (about 118 minutes), broadly along the lines of Pollock's edit, removing the film's perceived \"inappropriate\" communist subtext and religious imagery. Hugenberg's cut of the film was released in German cinemas in August 1927. Later, after demands for more cuts by [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Nazi censors]], UFA distributed a still shorter version of the film (2,530 metres, 91 minutes) in 1936, and an English version of this cut was archived in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) film library in the 1930s. It was this version which was the basis of all versions of ''Metropolis'' until the recent restorations.

He also called the acting \"uninspired with the exception of Brigitte Helm\". Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that \"the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Claxton |first=Oliver |date=12 March 1927 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=New York |publisher=F-R Publishing Company | pages=80\u201381 }}</ref> Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.{{sfn|Kaplan|1981|p=146}}\n\nNazi propagandist [[Joseph Goebbels]] was impressed with the film's message of social justice. In a 1928 speech he said, \"the political [[bourgeoisie]] is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission\".{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1997|p=25}} Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing ''Metropolis'' together years before, Hitler had said that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=164}}\n\nGerman cultural critic [[Siegfried Kracauer]] later wrote of ''Metropolis'', \"The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] Wagner and [armaments manufacturer] [[Krupp]], and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany's vitality.\"{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=150}}\n\nLang later expressed dissatisfaction with the film.

Moroder's version, which was made in consultation with the [[Munich Film Archive]] and their archivist, [[Enno Patalas]],<ref name=bennett /> was tinted to emphasise the different moods and locations in the film. It also featured additional special effects, replaced [[intertitle]]s of character dialogue with subtitles and incorporated a soundtrack featuring songs Moroder composed, produced and recorded with popular artists such as [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Adam Ant]] and [[Jon Anderson]]. It was the first serious attempt made at restoring ''Metropolis'' to Lang's original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available. The shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles for spoken lines instead of title cards, a faster frame rate than the original, and the fact that large amounts of footage were still missing at the time.\n\nMoroder's version of ''Metropolis'' generally received poor reviews.

A major problem  was that the Argentinian footage was in poor condition and had many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. Some of this they were able to overcome with digital technology, which would not have been possible in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again accompanied by the original music score, including Huppertz's handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining the places in which the restored footage would go. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than previously, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.<ref name=bennett />\n\nIn 2005, [[Australia]]n historian and politician [[Michael Organ]] had examined a print of the film in the [[Ng\u0101 Taonga Sound & Vision|National Film Archive of New Zealand]].

After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print.

Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film's narrative complexity.
