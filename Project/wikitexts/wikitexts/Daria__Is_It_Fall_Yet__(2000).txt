The word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nThough Daria and Jane are still on speaking terms, Jane is cold toward Daria, and their relationship is tense. Daria and Tom are seeing each other romantically, but due to Daria's personality and the gravity of the situation, they are taking things slowly. Jane has signed up for a summer art camp, seemingly to avoid Daria. At the camp, Jane meets Alison, an older artist, and the two bond over mutual contempt for their pretentious mentor and equally pretentious peers. However, Alison repeatedly tries to come onto Jane, dismissing Jane's protests that she is straight. The next time they meet, Jane signals uncertainty about her own sexuality.  But this turns to anger when she realizes that, after previously putting down their pompous instructor to ingratiate herself with Jane, Alison is now sleeping with him to further her career. This causes Jane to become disillusioned with the art world.\n\nDaria intends to do nothing but read, sleep, and hang out with her friends and boyfriend, but her mother [[Helen Morgendorffer|Helen]] forces her to work as a counselor at English teacher [[Timothy O'Neill (Daria)|Timothy O'Neill]]'s summer day camp for pre-pubescent children. There, Daria meets a nihilistic camper named Link, who constantly voices his disillusionment. It is loosely implied that he is neglected and emotionally abused by his mother and his stepfather. Recognizing herself in Link, Daria attempts to reach out to him. However, he rejects her overtures, causing Daria to feel worse. Paralleling these emotions is her relationship with Tom, which she effectively ends for the discomfort it brings.\n\nAfter getting a poor score on a pre-college admissions exam, Quinn desperately wants to prove her intelligence without ruining her image in the fashion club. Helen hires David, a no-nonsense tutor who gets Quinn to take learning more seriously. As the tutoring gets results, Quinn realizes that she is interested in David romantically. At their final session, she confesses her feelings to him, but David says she is not his type due to her low academic aspirations, noting that the college Quinn wants to attend is a party school. In a heart-to-heart talk with Daria, Quinn shows how much the rejection hurt her, but Daria convinces her that it is worthwhile to \"give people a chance\" even though things might not work out. The talk makes Daria consider whether she broke up with Tom prematurely.\n\nDaria comes to visit Jane, and, due to some meddling from Jane's brother [[Trent Lane|Trent]], the two reconcile. Daria later tells Jane that she was always impressed by Jane's strong sense of identity, which resolves Jane's identity crisis. Daria receives a letter from Link that invites her to email him, assuaging her fears that she is incapable of connecting with another human being. Jane affirms that she is no longer upset that Daria dated Tom and encourages her to get back together with him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tracy Grandstaff]] as [[Daria Morgendorffer]]\n* [[Wendy Hoopes]] as [[Jane Lane (Daria)|Jane Lane]], Helen Morgendorffer and Quinn Morgendorffer\n* [[Juli\u00e1n Rebolledo]] as Jake Morgendorffer\n* Alvaro J.
