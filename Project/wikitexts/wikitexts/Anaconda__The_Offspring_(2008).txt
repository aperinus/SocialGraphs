FauntLeRoy]] and stars [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Crystal Allen]] and [[John Rhys-Davies]]. The film is a sequel to ''[[Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid]]'' (2004) and the third installment in the [[Anaconda (film series)|''Anaconda'' film series]].\n\nIt premiered on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] on July 26, 2008, and was followed by ''[[Anacondas: Trail of Blood]]'' (2009).\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Romania]], an anaconda that was captured from the [[Amazon River]] is being held at a genetic research facility owned by Wexel Hall for experimentation where Professor Eric Kane has developed a serum for the Blood Orchid (the one recovered from the fountain after the ruins of the [[Borneo]] jungle). The research project is led by Dr. Amanda Hayes and funded by Peter \"J.D.\" Murdoch, a well-known industrialist. While visiting the facility, Murdoch provokes the anaconda with a large flashlight, and has it gassed to calm it down. However, as Murdoch, his assistant Pinkus and Daryl are about to leave, the anaconda kills Daryl and breaks through the enclosure's wall. As it escapes, it kills many of the people working in the laboratory. In looking through the facility, Amanda and the professor realize that the anaconda also freed the queen anaconda. The anaconda soon sneaks up behind them and crushes the professor to death in its coils and bites his head off. Murdoch calls in a team of animal hunters, led by Stephen Hammett to capture both snakes. Amanda and Pinkus go with them. At a small farm in the middle of the woods, the owner is eaten alive by one of the snakes.\n\nThe hunting party arrives later and begin formulating a plan of attack. During the first confrontation with the snake, two of the party are killed: Grozny is stabbed by the genetically altered anaconda's very sharp tail and Dragosh gets his head bitten off by the snake. Hammett arrives and gives the team a lecture on how to kill the snake. As the group splits up, Amanda heads off in a car with two other team members, Victor and Sofia. During the next confrontation with the snake, the anaconda spits acidic venom in Victor's face, burning it. The car crashes and Sofia is thrown from the car, breaking her leg in the process. As Amanda tries to leave the car to help her, the snake reappears and devours Sofia. Amanda is rescued by Hammett and both of them escape.\n\nAs they regroup, Amanda reluctantly reveals that the queen snake is pregnant and will give birth to more genetically \"special\" offspring in less than 24 hours. The teams want to call in the military, but Hammett forbids it and threatens Amanda with jail for her role in creating it. In the morning, the party begins searching for the snake, but Pinkus is stabbed in the chest by the anaconda and is killed. While Hammett searches for the snake on foot, Amanda and one of the three remaining hunters, Nick, spot the snakes first going into an old factory and follow them in to plant explosives around the building. Before they can finish, the snake attacks. Nick helps Amanda escape, but is wounded by the snake as it impales him with its tail, but Nick is able to discharge a grenade, killing both him and the snake. Hammett and his last remaining hunter, Andrei, arrive after hearing the grenade go off. As the two of them meet Amanda inside the factory, Andrei moves to set the charges, but Hammett kills him, causing Amanda to realize that Hammett is working for Murdoch who wants a live baby anaconda. Inside the building, the queen gives birth. After wounding Hammett, Amanda sets the timer on the explosives and escapes from the building, leaving Hammett to be attacked by the baby snakes while he tries to reach the bomb. Once she is at a safe distance, the explosives detonate, killing Hammett and the baby snakes. As she squats by a roadside burning all of her documentation on the snake research, one of Murdoch's men named Peter Resyner drives by heading for the factory where he finds one baby snake still alive and delivers the snake to Murdoch.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Stephen Hammett\n* [[Crystal Allen]] as Dr. Amanda Hayes\n* Ryan McCluskey as Pinkus\n* Patrick Regis as Nick\n* [[Anthony Green (actor)|Anthony Green]] as Captain Grozny\n* [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Peter \"J.D.\" Murdoch \n* Alin Olteanu as Andrei\n* Toma Danil\u0103 as Victor\n* Bogdan Uritescu as Dragosh\n* Milhaela Oros as Sofia\n* Serban Celea as Professor Eric Kane\n* Zoltan Butuc as Peter Reysner\n* Cristina Teodorescu as Murdoch's Assistant\n* Alin Constantinescu as Darryl\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''[[Anacondas: Trail of Blood]]'' in [[Romania]] ([[Bucharest]], [[Danube Delta]], etc.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anacondas_the_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid/news/1678588/hasselhoff_starring_in_anaconda_sequels |title=Hasselhoff Starring in Anaconda Sequels |first=Jeff |last=Giles |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2008-10-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005220345/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anacondas_the_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid/news/1678588/hasselhoff_starring_in_anaconda_sequels | archivedate= 5 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nSimilar to many [[made-for-television]] sequels, the film received poor reviews for having little to nothing to do with the previous films, poor acting and lack of special effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/anaconda3.html|title=Anaconda 3: Offspring - Review &#124; Sci-Fi Movie Page|website=www.scifimoviepage.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scifiandscary.com/bad-movie-recap-review-anaconda-3/|title=Bad Movie Mayhem: Anaconda 3: The Offspring|first=Lilyn|last=G|date=October 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reelfilm.com/anaconda.htm#3|title=The Anaconda Series - Reviews by David Nusair|website=reelfilm.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.homecinemachoice.com/content/anaconda-3-offspring|title=Anaconda 3: Offspring DVD review|date=September 26, 2008|website=Home Cinema Choice}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alternateending.com/2020/04/anaconda-3-offspring-2008.html|title=Anaconda 3: Offspring (2008) - Movie Review|date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of killer snake films]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1137996}}\n* {{Amg title|467001}}\n\n{{Anaconda}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 horror films]]\n[[Category:2008 television films]]\n[[Category:2000s monster movies]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:American natural horror films]]\n[[Category:Romanian horror films]]\n[[Category:Romanian independent films]]\n[[Category:Action television films]]\n[[Category:American thriller television films]]\n[[Category:English-language Romanian films]]\n[[Category:Films about hunters]]\n[[Category:Films about snakes]]\n[[Category:Films set in forests]]\n[[Category:Films set in jungles]]\n[[Category:Films set in South America]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Romania]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bucharest]]\n[[Category:Giant monster films]]\n[[Category:Syfy original films]]\n[[Category:American horror television films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:Stage 6 Films films]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Anaconda (film series)]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Don E.
