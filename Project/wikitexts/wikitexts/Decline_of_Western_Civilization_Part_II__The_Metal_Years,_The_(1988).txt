Filmed between August 1987 and February 1988, the film chronicles the late 80s [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scene. It is the second film of a trilogy by Spheeris depicting life in Los Angeles at various points in time as seen through the eyes of struggling up-and-coming musicians. The first film, ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]'' (1981), dealt with the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[punk rock]] scene during 1979\u20131980. The third film, ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization III]]'' (1998), would later chronicle the [[gutter punk]] lifestyle of homeless teenagers in the late 1990s.\n\nThe film features a mix of live concert footage and interviews with established heavy metal performers such as [[Lemmy]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Megadeth]], and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] Several unsigned club bands are also prominently featured, such as Odin, Seduce and LONDON.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film chronicles the heavy metal club scene in Los Angeles during the 1987-88 time period, with an emphasis placed on the [[glam metal]] subgenre.<ref>[https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-legacy-of-the-decline-of-western-civilization-part-ii-the-metal-years-30-years-later/ The Legacy of 'The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years' - Film School Rejects]</ref> While many established artists such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Dave Mustaine]], and [[Paul Stanley]] are featured in interviews, members of several unsigned L.A. club bands are also given a share of the spotlight, including [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] and Odin, and Detroit's Seduce. The film also features interviews with members of [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Tuff (band)|Tuff]], [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]], [[Faster Pussycat]], and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] Many of the struggling, unsigned acts appear convinced that worldwide stardom awaits them, and most appear to have no backup plan in place should this success fail to materialize.\n\nThe film includes several interview segments with Darlyne Pettinicchio, an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] probation officer, discussing the dangers of metal culture on children.\n\nThe film is well known for its many scenes featuring rock star excess. The scenes include:\n\n*An extremely intoxicated [[Chris Holmes (musician)|Chris Holmes]] of W.A.S.P. is interviewed in a swimming pool, with his mother by his side. He stumbles through the interview, proclaiming himself \"a full-blown alcoholic\" and \"a piece of crap\" while pouring what appears to be vodka over himself. \n*In a hot tub surrounded by scantily dressed young women, Odin lead vocalist Randy O insists his band will become millionaires, more famous than [[The Doors]] and be \"bigger than Zeppelin\". He says that the possibility of superstardom eluding him causes him to ponder suicide.\n*An interview with L.A. club owner Bill Gazzarri, whose \"sexy rock and roll\" dance contests at [[Gazzarri's]] on the [[Sunset Strip]] are presented as being sleazy and sexist.\n*Discussions with various musicians about the way women in general, and groupies in particular, are treated badly in the metal scene.\n*[[Riki Rachtman]] and [[Taime Downe]], owners of the Cathouse club in L.A., discuss how girls get entry to the club faster if they dress \"sleazy.\"\n*[[Paul Stanley]] of Kiss is interviewed in bed, surrounded from head to toe by three half-naked girls.\n*[[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of Aerosmith talk about spending millions of dollars on drugs.\n*[[Ozzy Osbourne]], while cooking breakfast in a kitchen, discusses his wild rock and roll lifestyle. In a scene that was later revealed to have been manipulated in post-production, he spills orange juice all over the table, apparently due to uncontrollable shakes. Spheeris also interviews him about sobriety, to which he replies, \"It fucking sucks.\"\n*An interview with [[Lemmy Kilmister|Lemmy]] from [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]. In his [[White Line Fever (book)|autobiography]], he claims that Spheeris interviewed him from a distance, possibly in an attempt to make him look stupid.<ref name=Kilmister2002>{{Citation\n| last = Kilmister | first = Lemmy\n| year = 2002\n| title = White line fever : the autobiography\n| isbn = 0-671-03331-X\n| publisher = Pocket Books\n| location = London u.a.\n| page = 210\n}}</ref>\n* Candid and sobering interviews from various artists about drug use, abuse, and dying (or nearly dying) from overdoses.\n*Lastly, Spheeris takes her cameras to [[Sunset Strip]] to film the nightlife in 1980s Los Angeles.\n\n==Musical performances==\n* [[Lizzy Borden (band)|Lizzy Borden]] \u2013 \"[[Born to be Wild]]\"\n* [[Faster Pussycat]] \u2013 \"Cathouse\", \"[[Bathroom Wall]]\"\n* Seduce \u2013 \"Crash Landing\", \"Colleen\"\n* [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] \u2013 \"Breakout\", \"Russian Winter\"\n* [[Odin (band)|Odin]] \u2013 \"Little Gypsy\", \"12 O'Clock High\"\n* [[Megadeth]] \u2013 \"[[In My Darkest Hour]]\"\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nIt has been claimed, most notably in the [[VH1]] documentary series ''[[Heavy: The Story of Metal]]'', that this film was partially responsible for the death of glam metal, and the subsequent rise of [[thrash metal]] and [[grunge]] during the next decade. The suggestion in the documentary is that fans, disgusted by the scenes of excess, decided to turn elsewhere. A similar claim was made by [[Dave Mustaine]] in his autobiography and in the book ''Hell Bent for Leather'' by British author Seb Hunter.<ref name=Hunter2005>{{Citation\n| last = Hunter | first = Seb\n| year = 2005\n| title = Hell bent for leather : confessions of a heavy metal addict\n| isbn = 0-00-716176-X\n| publisher = Harper Perennial\n| location = London\n}}</ref>\n\n===Faked footage===\nIn a 1999 interview for ''[[The A.V.
