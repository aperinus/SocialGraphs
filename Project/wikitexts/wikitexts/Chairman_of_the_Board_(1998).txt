After failing to make money at a variety of jobs, Edison soon runs into a wealthy business magnate Armand McMillan ([[Jack Warden]]), whose car has broken down on the side of the road. After Edison uses his inventions to assist Armand, the old man becomes impressed with his ingenuity, and the two go surfing together and quickly become friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/14/movies/film-review-an-inventor-and-heir-nonapparent.html|title=FILM REVIEW; An Inventor and Heir Nonapparent|last=Gates|first=Anita|date=1998-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=2019-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406040119/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/14/movies/film-review-an-inventor-and-heir-nonapparent.html|url-status=live}}</ref> When Armand passes away shortly thereafter, he leaves Edison 45% of the shares in his large invention corporation, and leaves Bradford ([[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]]), his jealous nephew and only living relative, a surfboard as his only inheritance. Bradford attempts to derail Edison's success by stealing his formula for [[Phosphorescence|glow in the dark]], which does not exist in the world of the film. Bradford shares it with a consumer who covers himself in it and alleges that Edison's prize invention\u2014a portable TV/[[TV dinner]] combo\u2014leaks radiation. When Edison reveals that radiation causes sickness and death, but not a literal glowing, the company is saved, Bradford is arrested, and Grace Kosik ([[Raquel Welch]]) makes a deal with the company to testify against Bradford. In the end, Edison appoints his girlfriend Natalie Stockwell ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]) to run the company.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carrot Top]] \u2013 Edison\n* [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]] \u2013 Natalie Stockwell\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] \u2013 Bradford McMillan\n* [[Raquel Welch]] \u2013 Grace Kosik\n* [[Mystro Clark]] \u2013 Ty\n* [[Jack Plotnick]] \u2013 Zak\n* [[Jack Warden]] \u2013 Armand McMillan\n* [[Estelle Harris]] \u2013 Ms. Krubavitch\n* [[Bill Erwin]] \u2013 Landers\n* [[M.

Comedian [[Norm Macdonald]] was a fellow guest on that night and, sitting next to Thorne-Smith, he heckled both Carrot Top and the film Thorne-Smith was promoting, incredulous that Thorne-Smith had left ''Melrose Place'' to star in a film with Carrot Top. When O'Brien asked Thorne-Smith the name of the film, Macdonald interjected, \"If it's got Carrot Top in it, do you know what a good name for it would be? ''Box Office Poison.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> After Thorne-Smith revealed the ''Chairman of the Board'' title and O'Brien challenged Macdonald to make fun of it, Macdonald quipped, \"I bet the 'Board' is spelt B-O-R-E-D!\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Macdonald said he apologized to Carrot Top, saying he \"felt kind of bad after that\" and that he had not considered that Carrot Top might have been watching that night.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFollowing Macdonald's death in 2021, Courtney Thorne-Smith later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'',\n\n{{blockquote|Every once in a while, I\u2019ll run into Conan and he\u2019ll apologize, and I say, \u2018That was one of my favorite moments of my life.\u2019 Teased by Norm Macdonald?
