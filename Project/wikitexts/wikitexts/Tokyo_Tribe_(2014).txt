Mera, the head of the Wu-Ronz tribe of Bukuro, joins forces with the violent and sadistic gangster Buppa of Buppa Town with the intent of initiating a gang war between the Wu-Ronz and the Musashino Saru tribes. When it comes to a confrontation between the two tribes, Mera attempts to kill Kai, a popular member of the Musashino Saru tribe. During the attempt Mera accidentally kills Kai's friend Tera, another member of the Musashino Saru tribe who has been beloved by members of all Tribes since before their formation. This causes all of the other Tokyo Tribes to join forces against Mera and Buppa's forces, leading to an all-out gang war.\n\nTokyo Tribe mirrors apocalyptic  art  house violence, horror musical and tribalistic themes from films such as Mad Max, Do the Right Thing, Rocky Horror Picture Show and various Tarantino films. The  film is almost entirely scripted in old school hip hop rhyme.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ry\u014dhei Suzuki]] as Mera\n*[[Riki Takeuchi]] as Buppa\n*[[Young Dais]] as Kai Deguchi\n*[[Nana Seino]] as Sunmi/Erika\n*[[Shunsuke Dait\u014d]] as Iwao\n*[[Takuya Ishida]] as Kim\n*[[Yui Ichikawa]] as Nori-chan\n*[[Bernard Ackah]] as Jadakins\n*[[Joey Beni]] as Kamekachi\n*[[Arata Matsuura]] as Skunk\n*[[Yuku Ishii]] as Hasheem\n*[[Makato Sakaguchi]] as Yon\n*[[Kokone Sasaki]] as rookie police officer\n*[[Hideo Nakano]] as veteran police officer\n*[[Hisako \u014ckata]] as DJ\n*[[Akira Yamamoto]]\n*[[Akio Joe]]\n*[[Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi]] as Chikatilo\n*[[Akahiro Kitamura]] as Mukade\n*[[Yoshihiro Takayama]] as Bouncer\n*[[Motoki Fukami]]\n*[[Hitomi Katayama]] as Yoko\n*[[Hiroki Yahiki]]\n*[[Haruna Yabuki]]\n*[[Cyborg Kaori]] as Beatboxing maidservant\n*[[Mao Mita]]\n*[[Miyuki Yokoyama]]\n*[[Shintaro Hazama]]\n*[[Hirokazu Tategata]]\n*[[Yuki Izumisawa]]\n*[[Stephanie (rapper)|Stephanie]]\n*[[Santa Inoue]] as Lotus Chief\n*[[Mika Kan\u014d]] as Erendia\n*[[Sh\u014dko Nakagawa]] as Kesha\n*[[Kunihiko Kawakami]] as MC Kan\n*[[Mega-G]] as Mega-G\n*[[D.O.
