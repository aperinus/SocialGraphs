The screenplay, co-written by Ramsay and Liana Dognini, was based on the [[Morvern Callar|1995 novel of the same name]] by [[Alan Warner]]. The film received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Synopsis==\nMorvern Callar is a young woman in a small port town in [[Scotland]] who works at a supermarket. She wakes on Christmas morning to discover that her boyfriend has killed himself, leaving a suicide note, a mix tape, Christmas presents, and the manuscript of his unpublished novel behind. His novel is dedicated to her, and Morvern decides to erase his name from the manuscript and replace it with her own before sending it to the publisher recommended in his suicide note. Despite him having left her money to arrange a funeral, Morvern tells her best friend and co-worker Lanna that her boyfriend has left her and moved abroad.\n\nAfter several days, Morvern cuts up his body and buries it in the mountains, and arranges a holiday to [[Almer\u00eda]], Spain with Lanna, who shortly before departure reveals to Morvern that she had slept with her boyfriend previously. As they go out and party, Morvern feels she's in a different mood from Lanna and heads back to the hotel; she meets a man whose mother has recently died, and has sex with him. The next day, Morvern convinces Lanna to travel with her to another town, where they get lost and spend the night on a rural road. Lanna becomes exasperated with Morvern, and in the morning Morvern leaves her. Morvern meets with publishers who have travelled to Spain with hopes of getting the rights to the manuscript. Morvern continues to pretend she wrote the novel and accepts an \u00a3100,000 advance.\n\nBack in Scotland, Morvern attempts to convince Lanna to leave with her, but Lanna refuses, stating her life is in Scotland and warning Morvern that everywhere else is just as bad. Morvern collects her suitcase and goes to the railway station, and is last seen in a nightclub, listening to \"[[Dedicated to the One I Love]]\" from the mixtape her boyfriend left for her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Morvern Callar\n* [[Kathleen McDermott]] as Lanna\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Morvern Callar'' received positive reviews from critics.
