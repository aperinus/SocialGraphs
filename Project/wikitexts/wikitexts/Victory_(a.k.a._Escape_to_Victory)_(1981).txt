The film is about [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoners of war]] who are interned in a [[Nazi Germany|German]] prison camp during the [[World War II|Second World War]] who play an exhibition match of [[Association football|football]] against a German team.\n\nThe film received great attention upon its theatrical release, as it also starred professional [[Association football|footballers]] [[Bobby Moore]], [[Osvaldo Ardiles]], [[Kazimierz Deyna]], [[Paul Van Himst]], [[Mike Summerbee]], [[Hallvar Thoresen]], [[Werner Roth (soccer, born 1948)|Werner Roth]] and Pel\u00e9. Numerous [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] players were also in the film, including [[John Wark]], [[Russell Osman]], [[Laurie Sivell]], [[Robin Turner]] and [[Kevin O'Callaghan]]. Other Ipswich Town players stood in for actors in the football scenes &ndash; [[Kevin Beattie]] for Michael Caine, and [[Paul Cooper (footballer, born 1953)|Paul Cooper]] for Sylvester Stallone. Yabo Yablonsky wrote the script and the film was entered into the [[12th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1981\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1981 |title=12th Moscow International Film Festival (1981) |access-date=January 27, 2013 |website=MIFF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421050907/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1981 |archive-date=April 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA team of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby ([[Michael Caine]]), a professional footballer for [[West Ham United]] before the war, agree to play an [[exhibition match]] against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German [[propaganda]] stunt.\n\nColby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, Robert Hatch ([[Sylvester Stallone]]), an American who is serving with the [[Canadian Army]], is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt.\n\nColby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to [[Paris]], make contact with the [[French Resistance]], and try to convince them to help the football team escape.\n\nHatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the [[Colombes Stadium]] they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.\n\nHatch is indeed recaptured, and is put in solitary confinement. Because of this, the prisoners do not know if the intended escape has actually been planned with the underground, so Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby actually has to break the existing goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of his injury before they will agree to let Hatch onto the team.\n\nIn the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again following the match. The resistance's tunnellers break through to the showers in the dressing room at halftime, in an escape Hatch leads. But the rest of the team (led by [[Russell Osman]] saying \"but we can win this\") persuade him to continue the game, despite being behind 4\u20131 at halftime.\n\nDespite the [[referee|match officials]] being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez (portrayed by [[Pel\u00e9]]), Carlos Rey (portrayed by [[Osvaldo Ardiles]]) and Terry Brady (portrayed by [[Bobby Moore]]). Hatch plays [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4\u20134. An Allied goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so the POW team should have won 5\u20134.\n\nAfter Hatch preserves the draw, the crowd storms the field and swarms the players.  In the chaos, some of the spectators help the Allied players disguise themselves so they can escape, and they all burst through the gates to freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Captain Robert Hatch\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Captain John Colby\n* [[Pel\u00e9]] as Corporal Luis Fernandez\n* [[Bobby Moore]] as Terry Brady\n* [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] as Carlos Rey\n* [[Paul Van Himst]] as Michel Fileu\n* [[Kazimierz Deyna]] as Paul Wolchek\n* [[Hallvar Thoresen]] as Gunnar Hilsson\n* [[Mike Summerbee]] as Sid Harmor\n* [[Co Prins]] as Pieter Van Beck\n* [[Russell Osman]] as Doug Clure\n* [[John Wark]] as Arthur Hayes\n* [[S\u00f8ren Lindsted]] as Erik Ball\n* [[Kevin O'Callaghan]] as Tony Lewis (as Kevin O'Calloghan)\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Major Karl von Steiner\n* [[Gary Waldhorn]] as Hauptmann Rainer Mueller\n* [[George Mikell]] as Kommandant\n* [[Laurie Sivell]] as Schmidt\n* [[Arthur Brauss]] as Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Lutz\n* [[Carole Laure]] as Ren\u00e9e\n* [[Beno\u00eet Ferreux]] as Jean Paul Remy\n* [[Clive Merrison]] as The Forger\n* [[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] as Pyrie\n* [[Michael Cochrane]] as Farrell\n* [[Zolt\u00e1n Gera (actor)|Zolt\u00e1n Gera]] as Viktor\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Major Rose\n* [[Daniel Massey (actor)|Daniel Massey]] as Colonel Waldron\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin]] as Claude\n* [[Julian Curry]] as Wing Commander Shurlock\n* [[Amidou]] as Andr\u00e9\n* [[Werner Roth (soccer, born 1948)|Werner Roth]] as Baumann\n}}\n<!-- Do not add minor roles (Anton Diffring, J\u00fcrgen Andersen, etc.) -->\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nFilmed in Hungary,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Scott |title=Escape to Victory - Still the Greatest Football Movie Ever Made |url=https://thelab.bleacherreport.com/escape-to-victory/#:~:text=Pele%20shows%20off%20his%20skills%20to%20the%20cast%20of%20Escape%20to%20Victory.&text=Enter%20Hollywood%20and%20Huston.,Victory%20was%20filmed%20in%20Hungary |publisher=thelab.bleacherreport.com |access-date=30 September 2020 |archive-date=November 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108142610/https://thelab.bleacherreport.com/escape-to-victory/#:~:text=Pele%20shows%20off%20his%20skills%20to%20the%20cast%20of%20Escape%20to%20Victory.&text=Enter%20Hollywood%20and%20Huston.,Victory%20was%20filmed%20in%20Hungary |url-status=live }}</ref> the film is based on the 1962 Hungarian film drama ''[[K\u00e9t f\u00e9lid\u0151 a pokolban]]'' (\"Two half-times in Hell\"), which was directed by [[Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri]] and won the critics' award at the 1962 Boston Cinema Festival.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/23/escape-to-victory-remake-david-beckham |title=Vinnie Jones keen for David Beckham to slip into Bobby Moore's shoes for an Escape to Victory remake |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=March 28, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Ben |last=Child |archive-date=August 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819214256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/23/escape-to-victory-remake-david-beckham |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was inspired by the now discredited story of the so-called [[The Death Match|Death Match]] in which [[FC Dynamo Kyiv]] defeated German soldiers while Ukraine was occupied by German troops in World War II. According to myth, as a result of their victory, the Ukrainians were all shot. [[The Death Match|The true story]] is considerably more complex, as the team played a series of matches against German teams, emerging victorious in all of them, before any of them were sent to prison camps by the [[Gestapo]]. Four players were documented as being killed by the Germans but long after the dates of the matches they had won.<ref>{{cite book| title=Dynamo: Defending the Honour of Kiev| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWSiHmYwPToC&q=dynamo:+andy+dougan| first=Andy| last=Dougan| isbn=978-0007404780| publisher=Harper Collins UK| date=June 28, 2012| access-date=August 19, 2018| url-access=subscription| archive-date=September 25, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925081121/https://books.google.com/books?id=aWSiHmYwPToC&q=dynamo:+andy+dougan| url-status=live}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\n''Escape to Victory'' featured a great many professional footballers as both the POW team and the German team.

The Brazilians did not join the war against the [[Axis powers]] until 1943, with the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] arriving in Italy in 1944. Similarly, [[Argentina national football team|Argentinian]] star [[Osvaldo Ardiles]]' character, Carlos Rey, is not identified as being from any particular country.\n\n==Music==\nNearly all of the film's music score borrows heavily from the first and last movements of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 7 (Shostakovich)|Leningrad Symphony]],'' particularly the march theme of the first movement, which is almost quoted verbatim, a practice which the composer [[Bill Conti]] would later employ in [[The Right Stuff (film)|''The Right Stuff'']] with [[Tchaikovsky]]'s Violin Concerto. Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 has always been associated with secondary meanings within the music aimed at the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] regime's overwhelming repression of individualism and freedom of expression, but at the time of its composition during the war was said to represent the oppression of Nazism. At the end of the film, the last part of Shostakovich's [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 5]] is also used to signify the triumphant conclusion of the story. However, while the music may fulfil the final moments of ''Escape to Victory's'' exultant ending explicitly, it is believed Shostakovich wrote the ending to his symphony to imply forced rejoicing under an authoritarian force. More prosaically, the music also pays tribute to [[Elmer Bernstein]]\u2019s score for ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.\n\nIn 2005, the Prometheus Records label issued a limited edition soundtrack album of Conti's score.<ref>Prometheus Records CD, 2005: PCR520.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 63% rating based on reviews from 8.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1022576_victory |title=Escape to Victory (Victory) (1981) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=July 28, 2021 |archive-date=August 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805144258/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1022576_victory |url-status=live }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film is rated 57 out of 100 based on 10 critic reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/victory|title=Victory|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=July 28, 2018|archive-date=July 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705052304/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/victory|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nIn March 2019, it was announced that [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] will direct a remake also titled ''Victory''.
