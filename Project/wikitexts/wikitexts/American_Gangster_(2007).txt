The film is fictionally based on the criminal career of [[Frank Lucas]], a gangster from [[La Grange, North Carolina]] who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the [[Vietnam War]], before being detained by a task force led by detective [[Richie Roberts]]. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]] with co-stars [[Ted Levine]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Norman Reedus]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Lymari Nadal]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]\n\nDevelopment for the film initially began in 2000, when [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story about the rise and fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] introduced a 170-page [[scriptment]] to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in [[Toronto]] for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with [[Terry George]], it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout [[New York City]] and concluded in [[Thailand]].\n\n''American Gangster'' premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grosses standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film took much creative license with the story, and three former [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. ''American Gangster'' was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Ruby Dee), and won three including a [[14th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1968, [[Frank Lucas]] is the right-hand man of [[Harlem]] mob boss [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson]]. When Johnson dies of a heart attack, Frank enters the [[heroin]] trade, buying directly from producers in [[Thailand]] and smuggling it into the U.S. through returning [[Vietnam War]] servicemen. Frank sells his heroin under the brand \"Blue Magic\", whose affordability and purity make it incredibly popular, eliminating much of his competition.\n\n[[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] detective and aspiring lawyer [[Richie Roberts]] is ostracized in his precinct after handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car. After his outcasted and addicted partner overdoses on Blue Magic, Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a special task force that targets major local drug suppliers. Roberts is also depicted having a bitter [[divorce]] battle with his ex-wife over his [[infidelity]].\n\nFrank's heroin racket prospers; he eventually sells Blue Magic wholesale to many dealers in the New York Tri-State Area and expands his distribution through other criminal organisations. With this monopoly, Frank becomes Harlem's top crime lord, opening legitimate business fronts and maintaining a low profile, while befriending politicians and famous celebrities (such as [[Joe Louis]]). He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers as his lieutenants. Frank eventually falls in love with and marries Eva, a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] beauty queen. He attends the [[Fight of the Century]] with her, where Roberts spots Frank, notices he has better seats than the Italian mobsters, and begins investigating him. Frank also comes to odds with competing local gangster [[Nicky Barnes]]; corrupt [[NYPD]] detective Nick Trupo, who is among many people Frank is forced to bribe; and the [[Corsican mafia]], who unsuccessfully attempt to assassinate Frank and his wife for putting them out of business.\n\nOne night, Roberts' detectives witness one of Frank's cousins, Jimmy Zee, shoot his girlfriend; he becomes their [[informant]] in lieu of being convicted. They make Jimmy wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]], through which they learn that Frank has negotiated one final shipment of heroin after the [[fall of Saigon]]. They identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering that it is being smuggled through the coffins of dead servicemen. They follow the drugs into Newark's projects and obtain a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to raid Frank's heroin processing facility, which results in the arrest of Frank's brother Huey. They then arrest the other four brothers, and finally Frank himself.\n\nDuring a trial against Frank, Roberts offers him a chance at leniency if he will help him expose corrupt police officers, to which Frank agrees. Following Frank's cooperation, three-quarters of the New York [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and many NYPD officers are arrested and convicted, while Trupo commits suicide. Roberts becomes a defense attorney and has Frank as his first client. Frank is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

The studio also sought for ''American Gangster'' to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company [[General Electric]] received [[tax credit]]s in New York City, so production was moved to the city. This change increased the budget to $98&nbsp;million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio argued about several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as [[Ray Liotta]] and [[John C. Reilly]] in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the pre-production process.

The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the \"wicked gangster\" and the womanizing and failed marriage of the \"do-gooder\" police detective.

While McMahon noted that the [[intertitle]] that appears at the end of the film, stating that Lucas' collaboration led to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was \"wholly inaccurate\", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and opined that \"[i]t would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films\", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to \"show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent\".<ref name=\"ABC/Reuters\">{{Cite news|publisher =[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]/[[Reuters]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/american-gangster-lawsuit-dismissed/1045622|title=American Gangster lawsuit dismissed|date= February 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right-hand man of [[Bumpy Johnson]], rising above the power of the Mafia and [[Nicky Barnes]], and that he was the mastermind behind the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story a myth.
