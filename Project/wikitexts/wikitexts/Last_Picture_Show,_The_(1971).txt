The film's [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Cloris Leachman]], and [[Cybill Shepherd]]. Set in a small town in northern [[Texas]] from November 1951 to October 1952, it is a story of two high-school seniors and long-time friends, Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges).\n\n''The Last Picture Show'' was theatrically released on October 22, 1971, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $29 million on a $1.3 million budget, and was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Johnson and Bridges, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Burstyn and Leachman, with Johnson and Leachman winning.\n\nIn 1998, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Hooray for Hollywood (December 1998) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9812/film.html |website=www.loc.gov |access-date=2020-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress |access-date=2020-11-19}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, Sonny Crawford and Duane Jackson are high-school seniors and friends in tiny [[Anarene, Texas|Anarene]], a declining oil town in northern Texas. Duane is dating Jacy Farrow, the richest and prettiest girl in town. Sonny breaks up with his girlfriend Charlene Duggs.\n\nAt Christmas time, Sonny begins an affair with Ruth Popper, the depressed middle-aged wife of his high-school coach. At a Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by Lester Marlow to a [[skinny dipping]] party at the home of Bobby Sheen, a wealthy young man who seems to be a better prospect than Duane.\n\nA group of boys take their young, mentally disabled friend, Billy, to a prostitute to lose his virginity, but she hits Billy in the face when he ejaculates prematurely. When Duane and Sonny take Billy back home, local businessman Sam tells them that since they cannot even take care of a friend, he is barring them from the pool hall, movie theater, and caf\u00e9 \nhe owns, all centerpieces of the town's social life. Duane successfully hides in the back seat. At the caf\u00e9, Genevieve, the waitress, tells Sonny she knows that Duane was with the group but agrees not to tell Sam.\n\nDuring the weekend of New Year's Eve Duane and Sonny go on a road trip to Mexico. Before they drive off, Sam, who has forgiven Sonny, wistfully wishes he still had the stamina to join them, and gives them some extra money. They return from the trip hung over and tired, to learn that Sam died suddenly of a stroke on New Year's Eve. In his will he left the movie theater to the woman who ran the concession stand; the caf\u00e9 to Genevieve; $1,000 to the preacher's son, Joe Bob Blanton; and the pool hall to Sonny.\n\nBecause Bobby has told Jacy that he does not date virgins, she invites Duane to a motel for sex, but Duane is unable to get an erection. She loses her virginity to Duane on their second attempt and then breaks up with him by telephone. When Bobby marries another girl, Jacy is disappointed. Out of boredom she has sex on a pool table with Abilene, a roughneck foreman who works for her father, who is also her mother's lover. He is brutally cold to her afterward. Jacy then sets her sights on Sonny, who drops Ruth without a word. Duane quarrels with Sonny over Jacy, \"his\" girl, smashing a bottle into Sonny's left eye that leaves him badly injured and disqualified for military service. Duane then joins the Army to [[Korean War|fight in Korea]].\n\nJacy suggests to Sonny that they elope to [[Oklahoma]]. They marry and on their way to a honeymoon on [[Lake Texoma]] they are stopped by an [[Oklahoma Highway Patrol|Oklahoma state trooper]]. Jacy had left a note telling her parents about their plan, secretly hoping they would stop her. The Farrows have them held in custody until they arrive, her father dismissing Sonny completely and taking Jacy home. Sonny rides back with Jacy's mother, Lois, who reveals she was Sam's youthful lover and chides Sonny that he was much better off with Ruth Popper than with Jacy. The marriage is promptly annulled.\n\nDuane returns to town on leave from the Army before shipping out for Korea. Sonny shows up at his home, and the two make amends. They go to the picture show, its very final screening (the [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', set in Texas and starring [[John Wayne]]). The next morning, Sonny sees Duane off on the bus. Billy is sweeping the street and is hit and killed by a truck, to the complete indifference of some of the local townsmen who blame him for being stupid and careless. Sonny is devastated and berates the men for their behavior. He then seeks comfort from Ruth who has since become even more depressed and has shuttered herself in her house. She explodes in hurt and anger. Then, spent, she takes his outstretched hand, tentatively reuniting the pair.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Sonny Crawford\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Duane Jackson\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Jacy Farrow\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Sam the Lion\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Ruth Popper\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Lois Farrow\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Genevieve\n*[[Clu Gulager]] as Abilene\n* [[Sam Bottoms]] as Billy\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Lester Marlow\n* [[Gary Brockette]] as Bobby Sheen\n* Sharon Taggart as Charlene Duggs\n* Barc Doyle as Joe Bob Blanton\n* [[Bill Thurman]] as Coach Popper\n* Jessie Lee Fulton as Miss Mosey\n* Robert Glenn as Gene Farrow\n* Joe Heathcock as the town's sheriff\n* [[John Hillerman]] as the English teacher\n* [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] as Tommy Logan\n}}\n\n==Production==\nGoing into ''The Last Picture Show'' Peter Bogdanovich was a 31-year-old stage actor, film essayist, and critic, with one small film to his directorial credit, ''[[Targets]]'' (also known as ''Before I Die''). He had made the first with his wife and collaborator, [[Polly Platt]]. As Bogdanovich later explained to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', while waiting in a cashier's line in a drugstore, he happened to look at the rack of paperbacks and his eye fell on an interesting title, ''The Last Picture Show''. The back of the book said it was about \"kids growing up in Texas\" and Bogdanovich decided that it did not interest him and put it back. A few weeks later, actor [[Sal Mineo]] handed Platt a copy of the book.<ref name=\"podcasts.apple.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/peter-bogdanovich-the-last-picture-show/id1437795866|title=It Happened in Hollywood on Apple Podcasts}}</ref> \"I always wanted to be in this\", he said, \"but I'm a little too old now\" and recommended that Platt and Bogdanovich make it into a film.<ref name=\"podcasts.apple.com\"/> According to Bogdanovich's recollection, Platt said, \"I don't know how you make it into a picture, but it's a good book.\"<ref name=\"documentary\">Peter Bogdanovich (2001) ''The Last Picture Show: A Look Back'' [DVD]</ref> Bogdanovich, McMurtry, and Platt adapted the novel into the film of the same name.<ref name=\"three\">Young, Neil (14 December 2002).

McMurtry had renamed the town ''Thalia'' in his book; Bogdanovich dubbed it [[Anarene, Texas|Anarene]] (for a [[ghost town]] {{convert|8|mi|spell=in}} south of Archer City). The similarity to famed [[Cattle towns|cowtown]] [[Abilene, Kansas]], in [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948) was intentional.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite web |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Filmsite Movie Review: ''The Last Picture Show'' |url=http://www.filmsite.org/lastp.html |publisher=Filmsite.org}}</ref> ''Red River'' again is tied in as \"the last picture show\", which Sonny and Duane watch at the end of the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=French |first=Philip |author-link=Philip French |title=Red River |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/27/red-river-hawks-philip-french |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 27, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2021 |issn=0261-3077 |eissn=1756-3224}}</ref>\n\nAfter shooting wrapped, Bogdanovich went back to Los Angeles to edit the film footage on a [[Moviola]]. Bogdanovich has said that he edited the entire film himself but refused to credit himself as editor, reasoning that director and co-writer were enough.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> When informed that the [[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] required an editor credit, he suggested [[Donn Cambern]], who had been editing another film, ''[[Drive, He Said]]'' (1971), in the next office and had helped Bogdanovich with some purchasing paperwork concerning the film's opticals.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cambern disputes this, stating that Bogdanovich did do an edit of the film, which he screened for a selection of guests, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Bob Rafelson]] and himself.{{who|Who screened it for whom? The grammar is opaque.|date=December 2021}} The consensus was the film was going to be great, but needed further editing to achieve its full potential. Cambern claims Bogdanovich invited him to do so, during which he made significant contributions to the film's final form.\n\nBogdanovich obtained a rare waiver from the [[Directors Guild of America]] to have his name appear only at the end of the film, after the actors' credits, as he felt it was more meaningful for the audience to see their names after their performances.<ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Paul |title=Credit 'Kane' With Another Film Trend |newspaper=[[Daily Variety]] |date=January 4, 1994 |page=24}}</ref><ref>{{AFI film|54257}}</ref>{{who|Who's names - just Bogdonovich's or the entire casts'?

re-released in UK and Irish cinemas, distributed by [[Park Circus (film distributor)|Park Circus]]. ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine gave the film a five-star review, stating: \"Peter Bogdanovich's desolate Texan drama is still as stunning now as it was in 1971.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Last Picture Show Review |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/the-last-picture-show-1 |work=[[Total Film]] |access-date=April 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released by [[The Criterion Collection]] in November 2010 as part of its box set ''America Lost and Found: The BBS Story''. It included a high-definition digital transfer of Peter Bogdanovich's director's cut, two audio commentaries, one from 1991, featuring Bogdanovich and actors Cybill Shepherd, Randy Quaid, Cloris Leachman, and Frank Marshall; the other from 2009, featuring Bogdanovich ''\"The Last Picture Show\": A Look Back'', (1999) and ''Picture This'' (1990), documentaries about the making of the film, ''A Discussion with Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich'', a 2009 Q&A, screen tests and location footage, and excerpts from a 1972 television interview with director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] about the New Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Last Picture Show |url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27533-the-last-picture-show |publisher=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\n==Director's cut==\nBogdanovich re-edited the film in 1992 to create a \"[[director's cut]]\". This version restores seven minutes of footage that Bogdanovich trimmed from the 1971 release because [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] had imposed a firm 119-minute limit.<ref name=documentary/>{{clarify|119 minute? Seven minutes off of 127 is 120, a much more logical time limit to have been imposed. As stated, Bogdanovich would have removed ''eight'' minutes. This needs clearing up.|date=December 2021}} With this requirement removed in the 1990s, Bogdanovich used the 127-minute cut on laserdisc, VHS and DVD releases. The original 1971 cut was never released on DVD or blu-ray for years, though it was released on VHS and laserdisc through Columbia Tristar Home Video. The 4K UHD release however, has the theatrical cut along with the more known director's cut. It's included as apart of Sony's Columbia Classics 4K Volume 3 set. <ref>{{Citation |title=The Last Picture Show 4K Blu-ray (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray) |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Last-Picture-Show-4K-Blu-ray/321652/ |access-date=2022-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThere are two substantial scenes restored in the director's cut. The first is a sex scene between Jacy and Abilene that plays in the poolhall after it has closed for the night; it precedes the exterior scene where he drops her off home and she says \"What a night. I never thought ''this'' would happen.\" The other major insertion is a scene that plays in Sam's caf\u00e9, where Genevieve watches while an amiable Sonny and a revved-up Duane decide to take their road trip to Mexico; it precedes the exterior scene outside the pool hall when they tell Sam of their plans, the last time they will ever see him.\n\nSeveral shorter scenes were also restored. One comes between basketball practice in the gym and the exterior at The Rig-Wam drive-in; it has Jacy, Duane and Sonny riding along in her convertible (and being chased by an enthusiastic little dog), singing an uptempo rendition of the more solemn school song sung later at the football game. Another finds Sonny cruising the town streets in the pick-up, gazing longingly into Sam's poolhall, caf\u00e9 and theater, from which he has been banished. Finally, there is an exterior scene of the auto caravan on its way to the Senior Picnic; as it passes the fishing tank where he had fished with Sam and Billy, Sonny sheds a tear for his departed friend and his lost youth.\n\nTwo scenes got slightly longer treatments: Ruth's and Sonny's return from the doctor, and the boys' returning Billy to Sam after his encounter with Jemmie Sue\u2014both had added dialogue.
