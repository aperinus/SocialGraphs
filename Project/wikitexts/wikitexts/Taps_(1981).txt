It was Penn's first film role, and Cruise's second and his first major role following a brief appearance in ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'' a few months earlier.\n\n==Plot==\nCadet Brian Moreland  meets privately with Bunker Hill Military Academy commander General Harlan Bache, who promotes him to [[Cadet Major]], the highest cadet rank. The next day Bache announces that the school's board of trustees will sell the school to [[real estate]] developers but that they will remain open for one more year to allow the seniors to graduate and the remaining cadets to find other schools. This gives many cadets hope that the school can be saved.\n\nA dance is held at the academy after commencement. Local teenagers outside the gates harass some cadets and a brawl breaks out. When Bache attempts to end the fight, his service pistol is seized by one of the local boys and the weapon discharges, killing one of the local boys. Although the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] was removed, a [[round (firearms)|round]] was still in the chamber. Bache is held responsible and after he is arrested has a [[heart attack]] which leaves him in critical condition at the hospital. The board decides to close the school immediately.\n\nMoreland meets with his officers and they unanimously decide to take control of the campus.  When the [[Dean of Students]] arrives with the local Sheriff to empty the [[Armory (military)|armory]] they find that the weapons are already gone. They are confronted by an armed cadre of cadets led by Major Moreland, who demand to meet with Bache and negotiate with the board of trustees to keep the school open. The Dean and Sheriff are escorted off the academy and armed cadets secure the perimeter.\n\nMeanwhile another group of cadets have been sent to a local food supply warehouse to restock their provisions but one of their trucks breaks down on the way back. As Cadet Captain Dwyer attempts to fix the engine a group of local boys threaten them and surround the truck until hotheaded Cadet Captain David Shawn opens fire with his M16, shooting several bursts into the air. The locals scatter and the cadets abandon the stalled truck, fleeing the scene in the second truck and ramming a police car in the process.\n\nThe police surround the campus and a delegation of parents led by Moreland's father arrives but does not change the cadets' minds. To demonstrate to the police and parents that none of the boys are being held against their will, Moreland assembles the cadets and offers them a chance to walk out. All of them choose to stay. The siege grows more tense when the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] arrives. The commander, Colonel Kerby, unsuccessfully tries to negotiate with Moreland.\n\nAt the next morning muster the officers report that some cadets have fled the campus.  Moreland assembles the entire battalion and again offers cadets the opportunity to leave. Led by Moreland\u2019s friend, Lieutenant Edward West, at least half of the remaining cadets drop their weapons and leave. After the electricity and water are turned off, one of the cadets is severely burned as they attempt to restart the school's old gasoline powered generator. They permit an ambulance to enter and take the injured boy to a hospital and, afterwards, Moreland offers to stand down if the order comes from General Bache. Kerby replies that Bache had died the previous night. The cadets, deeply hurt by Bache's death, hold a military memorial service in his honor.\n\nThe next night an [[M48 Patton]] tank rolls up to the main gate. One of the younger cadets, on sentry duty, panics and runs out to surrender. He drops his weapon which fires upon hitting the ground.  The National Guard return fire and kill another cadet.\n\nThe boy's death weakens Moreland\u2019s resolve considerably and he decides to end the occupation.  He calls all the cadets to muster and orders them to surrender. But the rebellious David Shawn starts shooting and the campus is overrun by the authorities as a firefight ensues.  Moreland runs to Shawn's room to stop him, but both young men are killed by suppressing fire and the siege ends abruptly. A montage of scenes from the Academy's proud past flash across the screen in the aftermath.\n\n==Cast==<!--- per closing credits order --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[George C.
