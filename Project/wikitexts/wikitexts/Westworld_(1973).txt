The film follows adult guests visiting an interactive amusement park containing lifelike [[Android (robot)|androids]] that unexpectedly begin to malfunction. The film stars [[Yul Brynner]] as an android in the amusement park, with [[Richard Benjamin]] and [[James Brolin]] as guests of the park.\n\nThe film was from an original screenplay by Crichton and was his first theatrical film as director, after one TV film. It was also the first feature film to use [[#Digital image processing|digital image processing]] to [[pixellate]] photography to simulate an android point of view.<ref name=yaeger>[http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html A Brief, Early History of Computer Graphics in Film] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717074134/http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html |date=July 17, 2012 }}, [[Larry Yaeger]], August 16, 2002 (last update). Retrieved March 24, 2010</ref> Critical reception was largely positive by contemporary and retrospective critics and ''Westworld'' was nominated for [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]], and [[Saturn Awards|Saturn awards]].\n\n''Westworld'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), and a short-lived television series, ''[[Beyond Westworld]]'' (1980). [[Westworld (TV series)|A television series]] based on the film debuted in 2016 on [[HBO]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1983, a high-tech, highly realistic adult [[amusement park]] called Delos features three themed \"worlds\": Western World (the [[American Old West]]), Medieval World ([[medieval Europe]]) and Roman World (the [[ancient Roman]] city of [[Pompeii]]). The resort's three \"worlds\" are populated with lifelike [[Android (robot)|android]]s that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and a simulated fight to the death. Delos's tagline in its advertising promises \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\nPeter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the [[Gunfighter|Gunslinger]], an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans but allow them to \"kill\" the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger's programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.\n\nThe technicians running Delos notice problems beginning to [[Computer virus|spread like an infection among the androids]]: the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing an increasing number of breakdowns and systemic failures, which are said to have spread to Westworld. When one of the supervising computer scientists scoffs at the \"analogy of an infectious disease\", he is told by the chief supervisor \"We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here. These are highly complicated pieces of equipment, almost as complicated as living organisms. In some cases, they've been [[Computer-aided engineering|designed by other computers]]. We don't know exactly how they work.\"\n\nAfter a night spent with two robotic ladies, Blane is accosted by the same gunslinger Martin killed in the saloon the previous day.  Martin bursts into the room and once again shoots the gunslinger dead.  Martin is jailed awaiting trial, so Blane breaks him out and the two head out of town.\n\nThe malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites Blane in Westworld and against its programme, a female android refuses a guest's advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World's [[Black knight|Black Knight]] android kills a guest in a [[Swordsmanship|sword fight]]. The resort's supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the park. The shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, unable to turn the power back on and escape. The androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.\n\nMartin and Blane, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld's [[brothel]], unaware of the park's breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, Blane treats the confrontation as an amusement but the android shoots and kills him. Martin runs for his life and the android implacably follows.\n\nMartin flees to the other areas of the park but finds only dead guests, damaged androids and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is soon shot and killed by the Gunslinger. Martin climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort's computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors, so he runs away until he enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger enters the room, Martin pretends to be an android, throws acid into the Gunslinger's face and flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.\n\nWith its optical inputs damaged by the acid, the Gunslinger is unable to track Martin visually and tries to find Martin using its [[infrared]] scanners. Martin stands beneath the flaming torches of the Great Hall to mask his presence from the android, before setting it on fire with one of the torches. Martin hears a call in the dungeon and finds a chained woman begging for help, Martin gives her water which causes her to short-circuit and shutdown, much to Martin's dismay. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him once again on the dungeon steps before succumbing to its damage. The movie ends with him sitting on the dungeon steps in a state of near-exhaustion and shock, as the memory of Delos' marketing slogan resonates: \"Boy, have we got a vacation for you!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Peter Martin\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Blane\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the Chief Supervisor\n* [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]] as the Medieval Queen\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as the Banker\n* [[Linda Gaye Scott]] as Arlette, the French saloon prostitute\n* [[Steve Franken]] as the Delos technician shot dead by the Gunslinger\n* Michael Mikler as the Black Knight\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as the Sheriff\n* [[Majel Barrett]] as Miss Carrie, madame of the Westworld bordello\n* [[Anne Randall]] as Daphne, the serving-maid who refuses the Medieval Knight's advances\n* [[Robert Hogan (actor)|Robert Hogan]] as Ed Wren (uncredited)\n* [[Kenneth Washington]] as Technician (uncredited)\n* [[Nora Marlowe]] as the Hostess\n* [[Charles Seel]] as the Bellhop\n* [[Robert Patten (actor)|Robert Patten]] as the Technician\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nCrichton said he did not wish to make his feature directorial debut (after one TV film \u2013 1972's [[Pursuit (1972 American film)|''Pursuit'']]) with science fiction but \"That's the only way I could get the studio to let me direct.

Lazarus said he asked Crichton why he did not tell the story as a book; Crichton said he felt the story was visual and would not really work as a book.<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nThe script was offered to all the major studios. They all turned down the project except for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then under head of production [[Dan Melnick]] and president [[James T. Aubrey]]. Crichton said\n\n{{Blockquote | MGM had a bad reputation among filmmakers; in recent years, directors as diverse as [[Robert Altman]], [[Blake Edwards]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Fred Zinneman]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] had complained bitterly about their treatment there.

Nobody who had a choice made a picture at Metro, but then we didn't have a choice. Dan Melnick&nbsp;... assured [us]&nbsp;... that we would not be subjected to the usual MGM treatment. In large part, he made good on that promise.<ref>Crichton p. ix</ref>}}\n\nCrichton said preproduction was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting<ref name=\"los\"/> and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000.<ref name=\"Crichton p x\"/> Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew, and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).<ref>Crichton p. x\u2013xi</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe film was shot in 30 days. To save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed, with minimal takes.<ref>Crichton p. xvi</ref> ''Westworld'' was filmed in several locations, including the [[Mojave Desert]], the gardens of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]], several MGM [[sound stage]]s and on the MGM [[backlot]], one of the final films to be shot there before the backlot was sold to real estate developers and demolished.<ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12461&mainArticleId=245816 |title=Westworld |publisher=TCM |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref> It was filmed with [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses by [[Gene Polito]].\n\nRichard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:\n\n{{Blockquote | It probably was the only way I was ever going to get into a Western, and certainly into a science-fiction Western....

This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging\".<ref>Crichton p. xiii</ref> The original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he \"had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine\" but when attempting it, \"it seemed stagey and foolish\", so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\">Crichton p. xix</ref> He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert but was unable to get the effect he wanted within a limited budget, so this was dropped as well.<ref name=\"Crichton p xix\"/>\n\n===Score===\nThe score for ''Westworld'' was composed by American composer [[Fred Karlin]].

Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton's assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between Gunslinger and Peter and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putlearningfirst.com/br/westworldshoot.html|title=Shooting Westworld}}</ref> Once the film was completed on time, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers' strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.<ref>Crichton p xvii</ref>\n\n===Digital image processing===\n''Westworld'' was the first feature film to use [[digital image processing]]. Crichton originally went to the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in Pasadena but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney Sr.]], who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to [[Information International, Inc.]], where they could work at night and complete the animation faster and cheaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/512325-whitney-family-pioneers-computer-animation/|title=The Whitney Family: Pioneers in Computer Animation |website=Tested.com}}</ref> Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear [[Pixelization|pixelized]] to portray the Gunslinger android's [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]].<ref name=yaeger/> The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds' worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source [[70 mm film]] images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec17.php |title=Ed Manning BlocPix |website=Atariarchives.org |access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |title=Chapter 4: A HISTORY OF COMPUTER ANIMATION 3/20/92 (note that this article is in error about the year the film was made) |access-date=April 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406031124/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/show-fest3/ArsElectronica'92/ChronologyTools/CompAnimTechHist.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The process was covered in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article \"Behind the scenes of Westworld\" and in a 2013 [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] online article.<ref>''[[American Cinematographer]]'' 54(11):1394\u20131397, 1420\u20131421, 1436\u20131437.
