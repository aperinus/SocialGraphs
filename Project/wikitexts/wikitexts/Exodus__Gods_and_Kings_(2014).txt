The film stars [[Christian Bale]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[John Turturro]], [[Aaron Paul]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], and [[Ben Kingsley]]. It is inspired by the biblical episode of [[the Exodus]] of the Hebrews from Egypt led by [[Moses]] and related in the [[Book of Exodus]]. Development on the film was first announced by Scott in June 2012. Filming occurred primarily in [[Spain]] beginning in October 2013, with additional filming at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[England]].\n\nThe film was released on December 12, 2014 by [[20th Century Fox]], to negative reviews from critics, who praised the visuals but considered ridiculous that Scott, a renowned [[atheist]], would direct a [[list of films based on the Bible|film based on the Bible]]. The film was also banned in [[Egypt]] and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] for \"historical inaccuracies.\" It earned $268 million worldwide on a budget of $140\u2013200 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- The plot summary does not intend to reproduce the experience or detail of viewing. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events. WP:FILMPLOT says that plot summaries for feature films and television series should be between 400 and 700 words. See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. -->\n\nIn 1300 [[Anno Domini|BC]], [[Moses]], a general and accepted member of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian royal family]], prepares to attack an encamped [[Hittites|Hittite]] army with Prince [[Ramesses II|Ramesses]] at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]]. A High Priestess [[Haruspex|divines a prophecy from animal intestines]], which she relates to Ramesses's father, [[Seti I]]. She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which \"a leader\" (either Moses or Ramesses) will be \"saved\" and the savior \"will someday lead.\" During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses's life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses volunteers to go to the city of [[Pithom]] in place of his cousin to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave [[Joshua]] being lashed and questions the vicious lashing. Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions the slaves must toil in. Moses meets with the slave elders to see if the slaves are planning on sedition as claimed by the Viceroy. After said meetings, Moses receives a message via Joshua that [[Nun (biblical figure)|Nun]] is looking for him. Moses finds Nun in the prayer house where he informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister [[Miriam]] to be raised by Pharaoh's daughter (he was born during the extermination of the Jewish heirs). Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily; during which he is attacked by two guards whom he quickly kills. However, two Hebrews spies overhear Nun's story and report their discovery to the Viceroy.\n\nMoses returns home where soon after Seti dies, and Ramesses becomes the new [[Pharaoh]] (Ramesses II). Hegep, the viceroy reveals Moses's true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of [[Tuya (queen)|Queen Tuya]], he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses's sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off her arm, Moses intervenes saving her and confirms he is a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moshe. Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to [[Midian]] where he meets [[Zipporah]] and her father, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah, and has a son, [[Gershom]].\n\nYears later, Moses is injured in a rockslide. He encounters a [[burning bush]] and a [[Angel of the Lord|boy]], a manifestation of the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]]. While recovering, Moses reveals his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, but Moses leaves anyway. In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother [[Aaron]] for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses's life, Ramesses orders Moses's death, as well as killing random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. God's manifestation appears to Moses and explains that [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his people further to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan, instructing the Hebrews to protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs' blood. That night, all of Egypt's firstborn children die, including Ramesses's infant son. Ramesses, devastated, surrenders, allowing the Hebrews to leave.\n\nDuring the Exodus, the Hebrews follow Moses's original path through the desert towards the [[Red Sea]]. Still grieving his son, Ramesses assembles his army and gives chase. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. In despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which recedes and clears a path to the opposite side. Ramesses and his army continue the pursuit, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts back, drowning the majority of the Egyptians ([[crossing the Red Sea]]). Moses survives and rejoins the Hebrews. Ramesses also survives, but is distraught and stunned over the destruction of his army, and with no apparent way to return to Egypt. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At [[Mount Sinai]], Moses transcribes the [[Ten Commandments]] which will be his replacement as the law when he dies. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the [[Ark of the Covenant]] sees God's manifestation walking with the Hebrews through the desert.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Moses]]\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]]\n* [[John Turturro]] as [[Seti I]]\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as [[Joshua]]\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Viceroy Hegep\n* [[Mar\u00eda Valverde]] as [[Zipporah]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Tuya (queen)|Tuya]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Nun (biblical figure)|Nun]]\n* Isaac Andrews as Malak\n* [[Hiam Abbass]] as [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Bithiah]]\n* [[Indira Varma]] as High Priestess\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Expert\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as [[Nefertari]]\n* [[Ghassan Massoud]] as Ramses' Grand Vizier, [[Paser (vizier)|Paser]]\n* [[Tara Fitzgerald]] as [[Miriam]]\n* [[Dar Salim]] as Commander Khyan\n* Andrew Tarbet as [[Aaron]]\n* [[Ken Bones]] as Ramses' Scribe\n* [[Philip Arditti]] as Viceroy Hegep's Aide\n[[Anton Alexander (actor)|Anton Alexander]] has a small role as the Israelite [[Dathan]], while [[Kevork Malikyan]] appears as Zipporah's father, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]].\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\nIn June 2012, [[Ridley Scott]] announced that he was developing an adaptation of the [[Book of Exodus]], tentatively titled ''Moses''.<ref>{{cite interview | url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a14300/ridley-scott-prometheus-interview-9423167/ | title=Q+A: Ridley Scott's Star Wars | interviewer=Eric Spitznagel | subject=Ridley Scott | quote=\"I've got something else in the works.
