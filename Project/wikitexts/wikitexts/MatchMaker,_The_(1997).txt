Sanders]]) from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In an attempt to court the [[Irish-Americans|Irish-American]] vote in a tough re-election battle, the bumbling senator's chief of staff, Nick ([[Denis Leary]]), sends Marcy to Ireland to find McGlory's relatives or ancestors.\n\nMarcy arrives at the fictional village of Ballinagra ({{lang-ga|Baile na Gr\u00e1}}, literally the Town of Love) as it is preparing for the annual [[matchmaking]] festival. She attracts the attention of two rival professional matchmakers, Dermot ([[Milo O'Shea]]) and Millie ([[Rosaleen Linehan]]), as well as roguish bartender Sean ([[David O'Hara]]).\n\nThe locals tolerate her [[genealogy|genealogical]] search while trying to match her with various bachelors. Sean tries to woo Marcy despite her resistance to his boorish manners. After they have begun their romance, they return home to Sean's house one afternoon to find his estranged wife Moira ([[Saffron Burrows]]) waiting for them. Marcy leaves Sean, upset that he did not disclose his marriage to her.\n\nMcGlory and Nick arrive in Ballinagra, although Marcy's been unable to locate any McGlory relatives. McGlory discovers Sean's wife's maiden name is Kennedy and brings her back to Boston as his fianc\u00e9e just in time for the election, and wins by a small margin. While at the victory party, McGlory's father ([[Robert Mandan]]) reveals privately to Marcy that the family is [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], not Irish. The family name had been changed at [[Ellis Island]] when they immigrated, but as they settled in Boston with its large Irish population, he never told his son their true lineage.\n\nSean follows Marcy to Boston, and they reconcile.\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film earned $1,378,930 in its first weekend and had a total gross of $3,392,080 in 705 theatres.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | work = [[Box Office Mojo]]| publisher= Internet Movie Database  | title=The Matchmaker | url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=matchmaker.htm | access-date= 17 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 50% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1079208-matchmaker/ | title = The Matchmaker | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gives the film 3 out of 4 stars. Ebert praises Garofalo, calling her \"one of the most engaging actresses around\" and admiring her balance of \"her cynical intelligence and the warmth of her smile\". Ebert finds the Irish centre of the film charming and says the Boston bookends are distracting.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 3, 1997 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-matchmaker-1997 |title=The Matchmaker Movie Review & Film Summary (1997) |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Irish response -->\nThe Irish Independent notes: \"Bad things happen whenever Hollywood and Ireland collide and this rather thin comedy is no exception\" but say the film is helped by the central performance of Janeane Garofalo.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 6, 2014 |title=Film Highlights Wednesday |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/film-highlights-wednesday-30402510.html |publisher=Independent.ie }}</ref>\n\nIn a 2003 interview, when asked what films from her career she was happiest with, Garofalo included ''The Matchmaker'' among the few films she mentioned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/janeane-garofalo-13846 |title=Janeane Garofalo |first=Tasha |last=Robinson |website=The AV Club |publisher=The Onion }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nMarcy's expectations clash with a host of colourful rural Irish characters in the tradition of such other works as ''[[The Irish R.M.]]''\n\nFilming took place on location in the town of [[Roundstone, County Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |date=September 11, 2009 |author=Declin Cashin |title=Funny Bone |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/funny-bone-26565371.html |publisher= Independent.ie }}</ref> Besides the personalities of the villagers, the film establishes a sense of place through a generous use of village scenes, the local surrounding farms and a trip to the [[Aran Islands]], with cavorting near [[D\u00fan Aengus]].\n\nWorked into the story is a parody of Senator [[John Kerry]]'s family background. His paternal grandfather was from Eastern Europe, picking a new name once arriving in America and blending into the Irish Catholic community in Boston.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Anchor|Soundtrack|Score}}\n[[Music of Ireland|Irish music]] is heard frequently throughout, both as background music and in scenes where it is performed live as when an Irishman (Vincent Walsh) competes for a kiss from Marcy with his [[Sean-n\u00f3s singing|sean-n\u00f3s]] rendition of \"[[On Raglan Road|Raglan Road]]\".\n\nThe soundtrack <!-- no soundtrack album http://web.archive.org/web/20071114074928/http://www.amazon.com/The-Matchmaker-Movie-and-Music/lm/R35RY5QLG8XLAU -->features \"[[Haunted (The Pogues song)|Haunted]]\" by [[Shane MacGowan]] and [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]]. \"[[Irish Heartbeat (song)|Irish Heartbeat]]\" by [[Van Morrison]] and [[The Chieftains]] plays during the end credits.
