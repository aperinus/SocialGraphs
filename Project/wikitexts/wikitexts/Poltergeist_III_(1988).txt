The third and final entry in the original [[Poltergeist (franchise)|''Poltergeist'' film series]], it follows young Carol Anne Freeling, who is terrorized by malicious spirits while staying in her aunt and uncle's apartment at [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[John Hancock Center]].\n\nReleased on June 10, 1988, the film marked O'Rourke's final feature, as she died four months before its release at the age of 12. Her death resulted in marketing complications for the film's studio, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], who did not want to exploit the tragedy. The film earned negative reviews from critics and disappointed at the box office, earning $14.1 million against a $9.5 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Freeling family has sent Carol Anne away from her native [[California]] to live with Diane's wealthy sister Pat and her husband Bruce Gardner in [[Chicago]]. Carol Anne has been told she is living with her aunt and uncle temporarily to attend a unique school for gifted children with emotional problems, though Pat thinks it is because Steven and Diane just wanted Carol Anne out of their house.  Pat and Bruce are unaware of the events that the Freeling family had endured in the [[Poltergeist (film series)|previous two films]], only noting that Steven was involved in a bad land deal. Along with Donna, Bruce's daughter from his previous marriage, they live in the [[John Hancock Center]] of which Bruce is the manager.\n\nCarol Anne has been made to discuss her experiences by her teacher/psychiatrist, Dr. Seaton. Seaton believes her to be [[delusional]]; however, the constant discussion has enabled the evil spirit of Rev. Henry Kane to locate Carol Anne and bring him back from the limbo he was sent during his [[Poltergeist II: The Other Side|previous encounter with her]]. Kane drains the high rise of heat and begins appearing in mirrors. Not believing in ghosts, Dr. Seaton has come to the conclusion that Carol Anne is a manipulative child with the ability to perform mass [[hypnosis]], making people believe they were attacked by ghosts. Also during this period, Tangina Barrons realizes that Kane has found Carol Anne and travels cross-country to protect her.\n\nThat night, Kane takes possession of reflections in mirrors, causing the reflections of people to act independently of their physical counterparts. When Carol Anne is left alone that night, Kane attempts to use the mirrors in her room to capture her, but she escapes with the help of Tangina, who telepathically tells Carol Anne to break the mirror. Donna and boyfriend Scott sneak into the security office while the guard is away, intending to make sure he sees only a videotape of the swimming pool and not see the swimming pool while their friends are there. On one of the monitors, they see a frightened Carol Anne running through the high rise's parking lot and go to rescue her. Yet before they can, all three are taken to the Other Side through a puddle by Kane and his people. By this point Tangina and Dr. Seaton are both at the high rise, along with Pat and Bruce. Dr. Seaton stubbornly assumes that Carol Anne has staged the entire thing, while Tangina tries to get her back.\n\nScott is seemingly released from the Other Side through the pool (which appears frozen, at first) and is taken to his home with his parents. Tangina is killed by Kane disguised as Carol Anne; and Donna later reappears by bursting out of Tangina's corpse. As Dr. Seaton attempts to calm Donna, Bruce sees Carol Anne's reflection in the mirror and chases after her while Pat follows. Dr. Seaton is not far behind, and he believes he sees Carol Anne in the elevator. However, after Dr. Seaton approaches the elevator doors, Donna appears behind him and pushes him to his death down the empty elevator shaft. At this point it is revealed that what came back was not Donna, but a ghost under Kane's control, which then vanishes back into the mirror with a ghost imposter of Scott at its side.\n\nHowever, even in death Tangina is still more powerful than Kane expects.  She returns long enough to give Pat and Bruce her necklace and an important piece of advice.  Pat and Bruce struggle to find Carol Anne, but Bruce is captured and eventually Pat is forced to prove her love for Carol Anne in a final face-off against Kane. Tangina then appears and manages to convince Kane to go into the light with her. Donna, Bruce, and Carol Anne are then returned to Pat (with the exception of Scott), leaving the other side. In the end, lightning flashes over the building and Kane's evil laughter is heard, hinting that Kane may not be gone for good.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Bruce Gardner\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Trish Wilson / Patricia \"Pat\" Wilson-Gardner \n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Donna Gardner\n* [[Heather O'Rourke]] as Carol Anne Freeling\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Tangina Barrons\n* Richard Fire as Dr. Seaton\n* [[Nathan Davis (actor)|Nathan Davis]] as Reverend Henry Kane\n** [[Corey Burton]] (voice, uncredited)\n** [[Julian Beck]] is credited for his previous portrayal of Kane\n* Kipley Wentz as Scott (credited as Kip Wentz)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nWriter-director [[Gary Sherman (director)|Gary Sherman]] drafted the original screenplay of ''Poltergeist III'' with screenwriter Brian Taggert, whom he had worked with on ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (1987 film)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'' (1987).<ref name=spirits>{{cite AV media|title=High Spirits: An Interview with Brian Taggert Allen|date=2017|publisher=[[Shout!

His feeling was that \"there are people on the other side of the wall, and no one cares that you are in trouble\".<ref>''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'': \"Curse of Poltergeist\"</ref> Additionally, Sherman was influenced by [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which served as a framework for the film's narrative, specifically the use of mirrors as a plot device.<ref name=spirits/>\n \nDevelopment of the film was announced in November 1986.<ref name=afi/>\n\n=== Casting ===\nTom Skerritt was cast in the film as Bruce, a Chicago apartment building manager, while Nancy Allen was cast as Pat, Bruce's wife and the aunt of Carol Anne who becomes her temporary guardian.<ref name=reflections/> Heather O'Rourke and Zelda Rubinstein reprised their roles from the previous two films (as Carol Anne Freeling and Tangina Barrons, respectively) the only cast members to do so.

Factory|Scream Factory]]|medium=[[Blu-ray]] short|work=Poltergeist III}}</ref> The sequence was filmed on a real platform, and required the actors to stand on the platform approximately 100-stories high.<ref name=reflections/> Because of recurrent budgetary restrictions that arose during the shoot, director Sherman was forced to make unexpected alterations to his and Taggert's original screenplay.<ref name=spirits/>\n\n==== Special effects ====\nUnlike the previous films, nearly all of the special effects were live and were performed on stage.<ref name=spirits/> The only visual effect added in post-production was the lightning flashing over the John Hancock Center in the very final shot of the picture. Sherman himself designed the special visual effects. On May 13, 1987, while filming the snow-covered parking garage sequence in [[Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois|Oakbrook Terrace]]'s Mid America Plaza, a special effects explosion caused six polystyrene foam-covered cars to catch fire.<ref name=afi/> A maintenance worker and two firefighters sustained injuries in the blaze, and the damage caused to the building was estimated at $250,000.<ref name=afi/>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nAt the time ''Poltergeist III'' began shooting in spring of 1987, [[Heather O'Rourke]] had been ill with flu-like symptoms and subsequently underwent medical treatment during parts of the filming. Principal photography for the movie lasted from April 13 to June 26 of that year, with June 10, 1988 as the film's scheduled release date. After O'Rourke completed filming, she returned home to California with her illness appearing to be in remission. However, in late January 1988, O'Rourke suddenly became ill again, her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she died on February 1, 1988 (barely a month after her 12th birthday) during ''Poltergeist III'''s post-production period.<ref name=phil>{{cite news|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41448354/obituary_for_heather_orourke_aged_12/|title=Heather O'Rourke, 12, a star of 'Poltergeist'|page=48|via=Newspapers.com|date=February 3, 1988}}</ref><ref name=siegel>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/355ac4e0f2b6bd8109f766de6ec0dfb8|work=[[Associated Press]]|title=Doctors: Unusual Circumstances Surrounded Actress' Death|date=February 4, 1988|last=Siegel|first=Fred|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190830193726/https://apnews.com/355ac4e0f2b6bd8109f766de6ec0dfb8|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completed film was rated PG by the MPAA in November 1987, Sherman and the studio decided to re-shoot at least part of the ending with a different special effects sequence.  In the original ending that was scrapped after O'Rourke's death, when Patricia jumps through the glass pane into the apartment, she finds Carol Anne, Donna, Scott, Bruce and Tangina frozen and dying. She then also becomes imprisoned in ice and gets attacked by Kane and her evil mirror reflection who want the necklace. Patricia tries to repel them and declares unconditional love for her family, but trips over frozen Tangina and falls to the floor. Suddenly, Tangina frees her arm from the ice and grabs the necklace. She convinces Kane that she is the one who can take him to the other side, not Carol Anne. Kane puts his hand on the necklace, but instead of ascending, his face cracks and he explodes. The blast frees everyone, but annihilates Tangina and causes a violent thunderstorm. Patricia, Carol Anne, Donna, Scott and Bruce finally leave the mirror dimension. Carol Anne sees a reflection of smiling Tangina in the mirror who waves at them and sheds a tear.\n\nPlanning and design for the new SFX make-ups took place between December 1987 and January 1988, with a possible shooting date set for early February. Following O'Rourke's death, Sherman did not want to complete the film, but pressure from the studio prevailed, and the entire ending was re-shot in March 1988 using a stand-in for O'Rourke, 7 year old child actress Heather Holty.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heather Holty|url=https://heatherholty.tumblr.com/post/188731342241/happy-halloween-from-little-heather-holty-as-carol|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Heather Holty|language=en}}</ref> In April, a re-edited version of the film including the new ending was submitted to the MPAA, after which it received a PG-13 rating. The finished film proved to be a critical and box office failure. Sherman has said that although he is proud of portions of the movie (particularly the creative use of mechanical \"in camera\" effects instead of the traditional optical effects often seen in movies of that genre), it is the least favorite of his films.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Release ==\n''Poltergeist III'' was released on June 10, 1988, in the United States.

However during the early 1990s a script for a potential prequel as the fourth film was being written. The script would have followed Reverend Kane, the main antagonist of ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' and ''Poltergeist III'' focusing on the events leading up to his followers and his own death which was briefly explored in ''Poltergeist II: The Other Side.'' This version of ''Poltergeist IV'' was set to have less special effects and be a psychological horror. However this fell through and several other ''\"Poltergeist IV\"'' plans came into the line which included the proposed idea of Martin Casella, a cast member from the original 1982 film, writing the fourth film. This was considered as it would be a good marketing tactic however nothing ever came of it.<ref name=\"poltergeistiii.com\">http://poltergeistiii.com/poltergeistIV.html</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled TV Series ===\nIn February 1989, plans for a ''Poltergeist'' TV series came into development with MGM/UA Telecommunications and two foreign partners whom agreed to co-finance  90 episodes of ''\"Poltergeist: The Series\"'' at a cost of $60 million, which ''may'' have participants from the three ''Poltergeist'' theatricals. However, this never came to production and instead MGM along with several production companies created ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]'' which ran for four seasons from 1996 to 1999.<ref name=\"poltergeistiii.com\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.mgm.com/#/our-titles/1542/Poltergeist-III ''Poltergeist III''] at MGM\n* {{IMDb title|0095889|Poltergeist III}}\n* {{mojo title|poltergeist3|Poltergeist III}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|poltergeist_iii|Poltergeist III}}\n\n{{Poltergeist}}\n{{Gary Sherman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poltergeist III}}\n[[Category:Poltergeist (franchise)]]\n[[Category:1988 horror films]]\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gary Sherman]]\n[[Category:Films set in apartment buildings]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:American ghost films]]\n[[Category:American haunted house films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joe Renzetti]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
