''Saturday Night Live'' regulars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Chris Kattan]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Mark McKinney]] and [[Colin Quinn]] star. This film expands on the original ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches where the Roxbury Guys were joined by that week's host, and bobbed their heads to [[Haddaway]]'s hit song \"[[What Is Love]]\" while being comically rejected by women at various clubs.\n\nOther roles include [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as a police officer, [[Chazz Palminteri]]'s uncredited role as gregarious night club impresario Mr. Benny Zadir, and [[Colin Quinn]] as his bodyguard Dooey. Ex-''SNL''er [[Mark McKinney]] has a cameo as a priest officiating a wedding.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve and Doug Butabi are sons of a wealthy businessman and in their spare time, enjoy frequenting nightclubs, where they bob their heads in unison to [[Eurodance]], a European subgenre of [[electronic dance music|EDM]], and fail miserably at picking up women. Their goal is to party at the Roxbury, a fabled [[Los Angeles]] [[nightclub]] where they are continually denied entry by a hulking bouncer.\n\nBy day, the brothers work at an [[artificial plant]] store owned by their wealthy father, Kamehl. They spend most of their time goofing off, daydreaming about opening a club as cool as the Roxbury together, and Doug using credit card transactions as an excuse to flirt with a card approval associate via telephone that he calls \"Credit Vixen.\" The store shares a wall with a lighting emporium owned by Fred Sanderson. Mr. Butabi and Mr. Sanderson hope that Steve and Emily, Sanderson's daughter, will marry, uniting the families and the businesses to form the first plant-lamp emporium.\n\nAfter a day at the beach, the brothers decide that night was to be the night they would finally get into the Roxbury. Returning home, Doug gets into a heated argument with their father about going out clubbing instead of staying home. Their father has planned a dinner party with Emily and her parents. The angered Mr. Butabi then refuses them access to their [[BMW]] car and their cell phones. They are given enormous cell phones by their mother, Barbara, and allowed use of the plant store's delivery van. The brothers go to the Roxbury when they are asked their names, being told they\u2019re not on the list and are denied entry.\n\nAfter discovering that they might bribe their way into the club, the brothers drive around looking for an ATM slamming on the brakes again and again while in traffic causing them to get into a fender-bender with [[Richard Grieco]]. Grieco explains to the girl with him in the passenger seat that his car is a racing car and therefore illegal. To avoid a lawsuit, Grieco uses his fame to get them into the popular club. There, they meet the owner of the Roxbury, Benny Zadir, who listens to their idea for their own nightclub. He likes them and sets up a meeting with them for the next day. The brothers also meet a pair of women at the Roxbury: Vivica and Cambi, who see them talking to Zadir and think that the brothers are rich. The women later sleep with Doug and Steve, leading the brothers to think they are in serious relationships.\n\nOn the way to the after-party at Mr. Zadir's house, the brothers annoy his driver and bodyguard Dooey by making him stop to buy [[Whipped cream|fluffy whip]] and making jokes about sleeping with his parents. As revenge, the next day, Dooey refuses them entry into Zadir's office for their meeting. He tells the brothers that Zadir was drunk out of his mind last night and does not know who they are. In reality, Zadir wanted to see them, but does not have their contact information.\n\nVivica and Cambi break up with the Butabi brothers after realizing they are not actually wealthy. Afterwards, the brothers argue over who is at fault for their sudden misfortune and Doug moves out of their shared bedroom and into the guest house. Meanwhile, Steve is forced into an engagement with Emily by his father. The wedding is held in the backyard of the Butabi residence, but is interrupted by Doug. The brothers reconcile and leave, but their friend and personal trainer Craig, reveals his feelings for Emily, and marries her. Afterwards, Grieco consoles Mr. Butabi to help him understand that Steve was not ready for marriage, and that Butabi is too hard on Doug.\n\nAfter the Butabi brothers reconcile with their father and Doug moves back into their bedroom, the film ends as the brothers happen upon a hot new club. The building is unique in that the exterior is constructed to resemble the interior of a nightclub, and the interior resembles a street\u2014this was an idea pitched by Doug and Steve to Zadir earlier in the film. Attempting to enter, they're asked their names and much to their surprise are told they are on the list. They walk into the club where they find Zadir and Zadir reveals that to reward their idea, he has made them part-owners of the club. Their new-found success comes full circle when they meet two women in the club: Doug's phone operator from the credit card company (\"Credit Vixen\") and a police officer with whom Steve flirted while getting a ticket.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Steve Butabi\n* [[Chris Kattan]] as Doug Butabi\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Barbara Butabi\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Kamehl Butabi\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Emily Sanderson\n* [[Dwayne Hickman]] as Fred Sanderson\n* [[Maree Cheatham]] as Mabel Sanderson\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Craig\n* [[Richard Grieco]] as himself\n* [[Kristen Dalton (actress)|Kristen Dalton]] as Grieco's lady\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Hottie Police Officer\n* [[Meredith Scott Lynn]] as Credit Vixen\n* [[Gigi Rice]] as Vivica\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Cambi\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Roxbury bouncer\n* [[Colin Quinn]] as Dooey\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Crying flower customer\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Bridesmaid\n* [[Mark McKinney]] as Father Williams\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Mr. Benny Zadir\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as the hottie dancer\n* [[Agata Gotova]] as Waitress\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = A Night at the Roxbury\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = September 29, 1998\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Eurodance]], [[dance-pop]], [[House music|house]], [[synthpop]], [[disco]]\n| length       = 60:40\n| label        = [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]]\n| producer     = [[David Kitay]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n|extra_column=Artist(s)\n| title1 = [[What Is Love (Haddaway song)|What Is Love]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Various\u2014A Night At The Roxbury (Music from the Motion Picture)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-A-Night-At-The-Roxbury-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/release/1049519|website=Discogs|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref> | extra1 = [[Haddaway]] | length1 = 3:53\n| title2 = [[Bamboogie]] | note2 = Radio Edit | extra2 = Bamboo | length2 = 3:15\n| title3 = Make That Money | note3 = Roxbury Remix | extra3 = [[Robert Clivill\u00e9s|Robi Rob's Clubworld]] | length3 = 3:51\n| title4 = [[Disco Inferno#Cyndi Lauper version|Disco Inferno]] | extra4 = [[Cyndi Lauper]] | length4 = 3:18\n| title5 = [[Do Ya Think I'm Sexy]] | extra5 = [[N-Trance]] featuring [[Rod Stewart]] | length5 = 3:25\n| title6 = [[Pop Muzik]] | extra6 = [[3rd Party]] | length6 = 3:05\n| title7 = [[Insomnia (Faithless song)|Insomnia]] | note7 = Monster Mix | extra7 = [[Faithless]] | length7 = 3:45\n| title8 = [[Be My Lover (La Bouche song)|Be My Lover]] | note8 = Club Mix | extra8 = [[La Bouche]] | length8 = 5:35\n| title9 = [[This Is Your Night (song)|This Is Your Night]] | extra9 = [[Amber (performer)|Amber]] | length9 = 3:52\n| title10 = [[Beautiful Life (Ace of Base song)|Beautiful Life]] | extra10 = [[Ace of Base]] | length10 = 3:11\n| title11 = [[Where Do You Go (No Mercy song)|Where Do You Go]] | note11 = Ocean Drive Mix | extra11 = [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] | length11 = 7:21\n| title12 = [[A Little Bit of Ecstasy]] | extra12 = [[Jocelyn Enriquez]] | length12 = 3:59\n| title13 = What Is Love | note13 = Refreshmento Extro Radio Mix | extra13 = Haddaway\n| title14 = [[Careless Whisper]] | extra14 = [[Tamia]] | length14 = 5:27                                                                                                 }}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\nIn May 2019, Kattan claimed in his memoir that he was pressured by producer [[Lorne Michaels]] to have sex with [[Amy Heckerling]] so she would direct the film (although she ultimately only produced, rather than directed it).<ref name=\"abuse\">{{Cite web |url=https://news.avclub.com/chris-kattans-got-a-disturbing-story-about-lorne-michae-1835065317 |title=Chris Kattan's Got a Disturbing Story About Lorne Michaels and ''A Night at the Roxbury'' |last=Neilan |first=Dan |date=May 29, 2019 |website=[[The A.V.
