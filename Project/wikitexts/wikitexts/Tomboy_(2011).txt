Laure sees a group of boys playing outside the window and goes to play with them, but they disappear quickly. Instead, Laure meets Lisa, a neighborhood girl. Lisa assumes that Laure is a boy and asks for Laure's name. After a moment's thought, Laure comes up with the male name \"Micka\u00ebl\". Lisa then introduces Micka\u00ebl/Laure to the rest of the neighborhood children, stating that Micka\u00ebl is the new kid in the apartment complex. Micka\u00ebl becomes friends with Lisa and the boys, playing soccer with them. When invited to go swimming, Micka\u00ebl cuts a [[one-piece swimsuit]] into male [[swim briefs]], and makes a clay penis to put inside.\n\nOver time, Lisa and Micka\u00ebl become closer, and Lisa eventually kisses Micka\u00ebl. Micka\u00ebl also becomes increasingly accepted by the group of boys. One day while playing, Lisa makes up Micka\u00ebl's face and comments: \"You look good as a girl.\" Micka\u00ebl goes home hiding her face under a hoodie, but Laure's mother says she likes it, encouraging her to be more like a girl.\n\nWhen Lisa comes by the apartment to look for Micka\u00ebl, she runs into Laure's precocious six-year-old sister Jeanne instead. The conversation makes Jeanne realize that Laure has been presenting as a boy. Jeanne confronts Laure and wants to tell their parents, but when Laure promises to take her along on all of Laure's outings for the rest of the summer, she quickly becomes happy to have a big brother, which she says is \"way better\" than having a big sister. She also helps cut Micka\u00ebl's hair to be more boyish, and promises to keep Micka\u00ebl's secret.\n\nAfter Micka\u00ebl has a fight with one of the boys for pushing Jeanne, the boy and his mother come to Micka\u00ebl's door to tell Micka\u00ebl's mother about her son's bad behavior. Laure's mother is quick to understand and plays along, but after the visitors have left, she scolds Laure for \"pretending to be a boy\". Jeanne understands Laure's predicament and does her best to support her sibling emotionally. Laure's mother forces Laure to wear a dress and takes Laure to the apartment of the boy that Laure hit, and also to Lisa's apartment. Lisa is stunned to see Micka\u00ebl in a dress and runs off without a word.\n\nDeeply embarrassed, Laure goes to the woods. After a time there, Laure takes off the blue dress, leaving on a tank top and boy-style shorts. Walking away from the discarded dress, Micka\u00ebl sees the other children in the distance. Micka\u00ebl can hear them talking, speculating about whether Micka\u00ebl is a girl or not. When they spot Micka\u00ebl, the boys chase and capture Micka\u00ebl and say they're going to see if Micka\u00ebl's really a girl. Lisa stands up to them and tells them to leave Micka\u00ebl alone. But when they tell Lisa: \"You kissed him. If it's a girl, that's disgusting, isn't it?\" Lisa agrees and reluctantly looks in Micka\u00ebl's shorts, with Micka\u00ebl in tears but letting her. Lisa is shocked. The boys and Lisa leave while Micka\u00ebl remains in the woods, devastated.\n\nLater, it is seen that Laure's mother has given birth to a baby boy. The family spend time together at home, with Laure not wanting to go outside. However, Laure sees Lisa waiting outside the window, and goes out to see her. After a long silence, Lisa quietly asks for Laure's name. \"My name is Laure\", Laure responds, and smiles a little.\n\n==Cast==\n*Zo\u00e9 H\u00e9ran as Laure/Micka\u00ebl\n*Malonn L\u00e9vana as Jeanne, Laure's sister\n*Jeanne Disson as Lisa\n*[[Sophie Cattani]] as Laure's mother\n*[[Mathieu Demy]] as Laure's father\n\n==Interpretations==\nThe film has been described as being about a girl who pretends to be a boy<ref name=\"pop\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/151281-interview-with-celine-sciamma-director-of-tomboy-2495918127.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029031940/https://www.popmatters.com/celine-sciamma-interview-2495918127.html | archive-date=2020-10-29 |title=What's Real and What's Not: Interview with Director C\u00e9line Sciamma |last=Fuchs |first=Ellise |date=15 November 2011 |website=PopMatters |language=en |access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-xpm-2012-01-27-ct-mov-0127-premier-attraction-20120127-story.html |title=Delicate touch given to gender-bending tale 'Tomboy' another gender-bending tale |last=Phillips |first=Michael |website=chicagotribune.com |language=en-US |access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> or, alternatively, about a [[transgender boy]].<ref name=\"psu\">{{Cite web |url=https://sites.psu.edu/245spring2015/2015/02/27/tomboy/ |title=Tomboy |last=Johnson |first=Janie Lynn |website=Queer Culture Collection (Penn State) |access-date=2019-08-02 |archive-date=27 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727033054/https://sites.psu.edu/245spring2015/2015/02/27/tomboy/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/12/15-films-featuring-transgender-roles |title=15 Films Featuring Transgender Roles |last=Brown |first=Brigid |website=BBC America |language=en-US |access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] said \"If you think you're looking at a boy, you see one.
