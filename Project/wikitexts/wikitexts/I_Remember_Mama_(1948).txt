Druten, in turn, had based his play on [[Kathryn Forbes]]' novel ''Mama's Bank Account'', which was originally published by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace]] in 1943. The story in all its variant forms recounts the everyday life and economic struggles of a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrant family in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in the early 20th century. The film stars [[Irene Dunne]] as the mother, as well as [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], [[Oscar Homolka]], [[Ellen Corby]] and [[Philip Dorn]].  Homolka portrays Uncle Chris in the film, a role he had performed earlier in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production.\n\nThe film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], including best actor and actress in a supporting role, with Irene Dunne receiving her final Best Actress nomination.<ref>Dirks, Tim.

Retrieved July 4, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with eldest daughter Katrin completing the last lines of her [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] [[novel]]. As she reminisces about her family life, there is a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to 1910, where the first of a series of vignettes finds Marta Hanson preparing the weekly budget with her husband Lars, daughters Katrin, Christine and Dagmar, and son Nels, who announces his desire to attend high school. Each family member makes a financial sacrifice to contribute to the boy's education.\n\nMarta's sister Trina arrives, announces she is marrying undertaker Peter Thorkelson, and implores Marta to break the news to their sisters Sigrid and Jenny. When Marta threatens to reveal embarrassing anecdotes about them, the women accept their sister's decision.\n\nWhen Jonathan Hyde, the Hansons' impoverished lodger, reads ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' aloud for the family, they are deeply moved by the story. Later, the family is visited by Marta's gruff but soft-hearted Uncle Chris and his housekeeper Jessie Brown, who is secretly his wife. When Chris discovers Dagmar is ill with [[mastoiditis]], he insists on taking her to the hospital. Dagmar's operation is a success, but Marta is prohibited from seeing her. Disguised as a member of the housekeeping staff, she sneaks into Dagmar's ward and softly sings to her.\n\nWhen Dagmar returns home, she learns her cat, Uncle Elizabeth, had been mauled and seriously injured during its outside wanderings.  Despite Dagmar's belief in her mother's healing powers, Marta feels helpless to save the cat and sends Nels to buy [[chloroform]] so she can [[euthanize]] it. The following morning, she is astonished when Dagmar walks in with an apparently cured cat. Instead of killing the cat, the dose of chloroform that Marta had administered only provided the cat with the deep sleep it needed to aid its recovery.\n\nMr. Hyde suddenly and quietly moves out, leaving his classic books and a check for his accumulated months of rent. The family's initial joy of receiving the large rent payment quickly vanishes once they discover that the check has no value. Sigrid and Jenny are furious; but as Marta tears up the worthless piece of paper, she declares that Hyde's gift of literature is far more valuable than the money itself.\n\nKatrin brags to Christine that their mother is going to buy her the dresser set she has long admired as a graduation present. As she is about to leave to perform in the school's production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Katrin learns (from a resentful Christine) that her mother traded her [[heirloom]] brooch for the gift. Distraught, Katrin performs badly in the play and later retrieves the brooch after trading back the dresser set. Marta then gives the brooch to Katrin as a graduation present. Katrin's father presents her with her first cup of coffee, which she had been told she could drink once she was a grown-up. After taking a few sips of the \"adult\" beverage, Katrin is overcome with emotion by her parents' gesture, and she rushes out of the room.\n\nMarta learns Uncle Chris is near death, and she takes Katrin to say goodbye. He reveals he has no money to leave his niece because he has been donating his income to help children with leg or foot problems walk again. He also reveals he is married to his housekeeper Jessie. After enjoying a final drink with his niece and Jessie, Uncle Chris dies peacefully in bed.\n\nTrina marries Peter Thorkelson in the Hanson's parlor.  One year later, they are seen on a [[Bench (furniture)|park bench]] with their baby in a [[baby carriage]].\n\nKatrin is dejected when she receives her tenth literary rejection letter. Marta then takes some of her stories to famed author and [[gourmand]] Florence Dana Moorhead and convinces her to read them. Marta returns home and advises her daughter that Moorhead feels the girl should write about what she knows best. Marta urges Katrin to write about Papa. When Katrin's story is accepted for publication, she is paid $500 ({{Inflation|US|500|1910|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). After announcing some of the money will go towards the purchase of the winter coat Marta wants, Katrin confesses her story is titled ''Mama and the Hospital''. She begins to read it to her family, and the story's introduction concludes and the film itself ends with the line \"But first and foremost, I remember Mama\".<ref name=\"Crowther\">{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=March 12, 1948 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/03/12/archives/the-screen-irene-dunne-and-oscar-homotka-head-brilliant-cast-in-rko.html |title=THE SCREEN; Irene Dunne and Oscar Homolka Head Brilliant Cast in RKO 'I Remember Mama' |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 4, 2017 }}</ref><ref>Brenner, Paul.
