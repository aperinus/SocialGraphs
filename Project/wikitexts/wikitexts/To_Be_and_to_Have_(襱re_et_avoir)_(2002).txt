It was screened as an \"Out of Competition\" film at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3158545/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: To Be and to Have |access-date=2009-11-03|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and achieved commercial success.<ref name=\"guardian 04-10-03\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/03/film.france|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Amelia Gentleman|title=Film's fallen hero fights on for his class\n|date=3 October 2004}}</ref> The film became the subject of an unsuccessful legal action by the school's teacher, who said that he and the children's parents had been misled about the film's intended audience, and that he and the children had been exploited.\n\nThe documentary's title translates as \"to be and to have\", the two [[auxiliary verb]]s in the [[French language]]. It is about a [[primary school]] in the [[Commune in France|commune]] of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne-sur-Usson]], [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]], [[France]], the population of which is just over 200. The school has one small class of mixed ages (from four to twelve years), with a dedicated teacher, Mr Lopez, who shows patience and respect for the children as we follow their story through a single school year.\n\nThe film won several awards, including the 2003 [[Sacramento French Film Festival]] Audience Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318202/awards|title=\u00catre et avoir - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A small, sensitive, and moving portrait of a teacher and his students.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_be_and_to_have |title=To Be and to Have (Etre et Avoir) (2003) |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/to-be-and-to-have |title=To Be and to Have |website=Metacritic }}</ref>\n\n==Lawsuit==\nFollowing the film's popularity in cinemas, Lopez, the principal personality in the documentary, made an unsuccessful attempt to sue the documentary's makers for a share of the [[Euro|\u20ac]]2 million profit. One of his main claims was that the film-makers had exploited his image without authorisation.<ref name=\"bbc 03-10-13\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3187656.stm|publisher=[[The BBC]]|title=French film star teacher sues |date=13 October 2003}}</ref> French film unions warned that if Lopez had been successful it would have spelt \"the death of the documentary, undermining the crucial principle that subjects should not be paid to participate\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1315116,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Amelia Gentleman|title=Defeat for teacher who sued over film profits|date=29 September 2004}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking after the court case, Lopez said that he, the children and their families had been misled by the film's production company about the purpose and intended audience of the film:\n<blockquote>\n\"We were misled. The production company told me and the children's families that they were making a small documentary about the phenomenon of the one-teacher village school and that the film would be used primarily for educational purposes. They said it would have a restricted screening, and never discussed marketing the film to make it such a commercial venture....We had no idea that it would be in cinemas all over the country, released on DVD or distributed abroad.<ref name=\"guardian 04-10-03\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe court ruled that Lopez's attendance at the Cannes film festival, which he attended with some of the students,<ref name=\"bbc 03-10-13\" /> and his repeated public expressions of satisfaction at its success, constituted his tacit acceptance of the use of his image.<ref name=\"guardian 04-10-03\" />\n\nThe French media had been critical of Lopez, with one newspaper carrying the headline: \"To be and to have: the teacher would rather have.\" However Lopez said money was never his motivation: \"I'm simply trying to make the film company recognise my rights.\" Lopez was supported in his action by the families of most of his former pupils, some of whom stated that they themselves would also sue the film company.<ref name=\"guardian 04-10-03\" />\n\nLopez said the unexpected attention the film had brought the young students had traumatised some of them:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"One child, who had been very stable and happy until the film's release, was so distressed by his unexpected fame, that he started wetting the bed, and became afraid of the dark...Other children have been teased at their new secondary schools because of their involvement. All have been subjected to a great deal of stress as a direct consequence of the film.\"<ref name=\"guardian 04-10-03\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"|Award / Film Festival\n! scope=\"col\"|Category\n! scope=\"col\"|Recipients and nominees\n! scope=\"col\"|Result\n|-\n|[[BBC Four World Cinema Awards]]\n!\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[57th British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Awards]]\n|[[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[28th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]]\n|[[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|[[Nicolas Philibert]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]]\n|Nicolas Philibert\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[Directors Guild of Great Britain]]\n|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Foreign Language Film\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[15th European Film Awards|European Film Awards]]\n|[[European Film Award for Best Documentary|Best Documentary]]\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]]\n|Best French Film\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]]\n|Jury Award\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[London Film Critics Circle Awards 2003|London Film Critics Circle Awards]]\n|[[London Film Critics' Circle Award for Foreign Language Film of the Year|Foreign Language Film of the Year]]\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[Louis Delluc Prize]]\n|Best Film\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|[[2003 National Society of Film Critics Awards|National Society of Film Critics Awards]]\n|[[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film|Best Non-Fiction Film]]\n!\n| {{won}}\n|-\n|Online Film & Television Association Award\n|Best Documentary Picture\n!\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|[[Valladolid International Film Festival]]\n|Best Documentary\n!\n| {{won}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0318202}}\n*{{Amg movie|265268|To Be and to Have}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=to_be_and_to_have|title=To Be and to Have}}\n*{{Metacritic film|title=To Be and to Have}}\n*{{mojo title|id=tobeandtohave|title=To Be and to Have}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''To Be and to Have''\n|list1 =\n{{European Film Award for Best Documentary}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:To Be And to Have}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:French documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about children]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nicolas Philibert]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about education]]\n[[Category:2002 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]\n[[Category:European Film Awards winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
