The family's car stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which Chihiro's father insists on exploring, despite his daughter's protest. They find a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro reaches an enormous [[Sent\u014d|bathhouse]] and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers that her parents have been transformed into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.\n\nHaku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a [[y\u014dkai]] commanding the [[susuwatari]]. Kamaji refuses to hire her and asks worker Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, and is eventually given a working contract. Yubaba takes away the second [[kanji]] of her name, renaming her {{nihongo|Sen|\u5343}}. While visiting her parents' pigpen, Sen realizes that she had already forgotten her real name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by taking their names, and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.\n\nSen faces discrimination from the other workers; only Kamaji and Lin show sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face (''Kaonashi'' {{lang|ja|\u9854\u7121\u3057}}) inside, believing him to be a customer. A \"stink spirit\" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic [[Vomiting#Emetics|emetic]] dumpling. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the river spirit and tempts a worker with it, then swallowing him. No-Face demands food from the bathhouse and begins giving away extensive amounts of gold to its workers.\n\nSen sees paper [[Shikigami]] attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse, and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling, causing him to vomit up the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.\n\nWith Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts an engorged No-Face, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything that he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.\n\nSen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the black slug to take control over Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and offers to fly them home. No-Face decides to stay behind with Zeniba and become her spinner, while Sen and Boh leave with Haku for the bathhouse. In mid-flight, Sen recalls falling years ago into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as {{nihongo|the spirit of the Kohaku River|\u30cb\u30ae\u30cf\u30e4\u30df \u30b3\u30cf\u30af\u30cc\u30b7|Nigihayami Kohakunushi}}. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything after eating at the restaurant stall. They walk back through the tunnel until they reach their car, now covered in dust and leaves. Before getting in, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, her hair tie from Zeniba still intact.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Character name\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Voice actor\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|English\n!scope=\"col\"|Japanese (Nihongo)\n!scope=\"col\"|Japanese\n!scope=\"col\"|English\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Chihiro Ogino / Sen\n|''Ogino Chihiro'' ({{Lang-ja|\u837b\u91ce \u5343\u5c0b|label=none}}) <big>/</big> ''Sen'' ({{Lang-ja|\u5343|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"one thousand\".}}\n|[[Rumi Hiiragi]]||[[Daveigh Chase]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Haku / Spirit of the Kohaku River\n|''Haku'' ({{Lang-ja|\u30cf\u30af|label=none}}) <big>/</big> ''Nigihayami Kohakunushi'' ({{Lang-ja|\u9952\u901f\u6c34\u5c0f\u767d\u4e3b|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"flourishing swift-flowing amber [river] god\".}}||[[Miyu Irino]]||[[Jason Marsden]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Yubaba\n|''Yub\u0101ba'' ({{Lang-ja|\u6e6f\u5a46\u5a46|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"bathhouse granny\".}}|| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Mari Natsuki]]|| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Suzanne Pleshette]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Zeniba\n|''Zeniiba'' ({{Lang-ja|\u92ad\u5a46|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"money granny\".}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Kamaji\n|''Kamajii'' ({{Lang-ja|\u91dc\u723a|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"boiler grandad\".}}||[[Bunta Sugawara]]||[[David Ogden Stiers]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Lin\n|''Rin'' ({{Lang-ja|\u30ea\u30f3|label=none}})||[[Yoomi Tamai]]||[[Susan Egan]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Chichiyaku\n|''Chichiyaku'' ({{Lang-ja|\u7236\u5f79|label=none}})\n|[[Tsunehiko Kamij\u014d]]||[[Paul Eiding]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Aniyaku (assistant Manager)\n|Aniyaku ({{Lang-ja|\u5144\u5f79|label=none}})\n|[[:ja:\u5c0f\u91ce\u6b66\u5f66|Takehiko Ono]]||[[John Ratzenberger]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| No-Face{{efn|name=Faceless|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"faceless\".}}\n|''Kaonashi'' ({{Lang-ja|\u9854\u7121\u3057|label=none}}){{efn|name=Faceless}}\n|[[:ja:\u4e2d\u6751\u5f70\u7537|Akio Nakamura]]|| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Bob Bergen]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Aogaeru\n|''Aogaeru'' ({{Lang-ja|\u9752\u86d9|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"blue frog\".}}\n|[[:ja:\u6211\u4fee\u9662\u9054\u4e5f|Tatsuya Gash\u016bin]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Bandai-gaeru (foreman)\n|''Bandai-gaeru'' ({{Lang-ja|\u756a\u53f0\u86d9|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"reception desk frog\".}}\n|[[Yo Oizumi|Y\u014d \u014cizumi]]||[[Rodger Bumpass]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Boh (baby)\n|''B\u014d'' ({{Lang-ja|\u574a|label=none}})\n|[[Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki]]||[[Tara Strong]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Akio Ogino (Chihiro's father)\n|''Ogino Akio'' ({{Lang-ja|\u837b\u91ce \u660e\u592b|label=none}})\n|[[:ja:\u5185\u85e4\u525b\u5fd7|Takashi Nait\u014d]]||[[Michael Chiklis]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Y\u016bko Ogino (Chihiro's mother)\n|''Ogino Y\u016bko'' ({{Lang-ja|\u837b\u91ce \u60a0\u5b50|label=none}})\n|[[Yasuko Sawaguchi]]||[[Lauren Holly]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| River Spirit\n|[[Kawa-no-kami|''Kawa no Kami'']] ({{Lang-ja|\u6cb3\u306e\u795e|label=none}})\n|[[:ja:\u306f\u3084\u3057\u30fb\u3053\u3070|Koba Hayashi]]||[[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Radish Spirit\n|''[[Oshira-sama]]'' ({{Lang-ja|\u304a\u767d\u69d8|label=none}}){{efn|{{abbr|Lit.|Literal translation}} \"Great White Lord\".}}\n|[[Ken Yasuda (actor)|Ken Yasuda]]||[[Jack Angel]]\n|}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and inspiration===\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote=\"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...].

The idea for ''Spirited Away'' came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls.

He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house.

The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including [[kami]], come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:{{blockquote|In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere&nbsp;\u2013 in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />}}Chihiro's [[archetype|archetypal]] entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word ''[[kamikakushi]]'' (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'\"<ref name=\"reider\">Reider, Noriko T. 11 February 2009. \"Spirited Away: Film of the Fantastic and Evolving Japanese Folk Symbols.\" ''[[Film Criticism (journal)|Film Criticism]]'' 29(3):4\u201327.</ref>\n\nAdditional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more.

It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coats |first1=Pam |title=Making of Spirited Away |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ7ymWBf7XE |website=YouTube |access-date=30 April 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saporito|first1=Jeff|title=What does \"Spirited Away\" say about Environmentalism?|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|website=ScreenPrism|access-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303201035/http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|archive-date=3 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=What does \"Spirited Away\" say about Environmentalism? |url=https://the-take.com/watch/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism |website=The Take |date=19 November 2015 |access-date=30 April 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office and theatrical release===\n''Spirited Away'' was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor [[Toho]].
