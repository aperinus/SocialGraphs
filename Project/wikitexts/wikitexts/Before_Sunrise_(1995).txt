The first installment in the [[Before trilogy|''Before'' trilogy]], it follows Jesse ([[Ethan Hawke]]) and C\u00e9line ([[Julie Delpy]]) as they meet on a [[Eurail]] train and disembark in [[Vienna]] to spend the night together.\n\nInspired by personal experiences, Linklater collaborated with Krizan, who previously appeared in his films ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' (1991) and ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'' (1993), to develop the screenplay. Casting was extensive; it took nine months for Hawke and Delpy to be cast with [[principal photography]] taking place entirely in Vienna.\n\nThe plot is considered minimalistic, consisting mostly of monologues and casual conversation with extended dialogue as the characters navigate Vienna. Their contrasting ideas and perspectives on life and love are detailed, with Jesse a romantic disguised as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], and C\u00e9line seemingly a romantic. ''Before Sunrise'' also explores time, death, and self-discovery.\n\n''Before Sunrise'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 1995, and was theatrically released eight days later. It grossed $22.5 million against a $2.5 million budget and received critical acclaim, particularly for its exploration of [[postmodern]] romance, the screenplay, Linklater's direction, and acting performances. ''Before Sunrise'' also received a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|rating of 100%]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films of the year. A [[sequel]], ''[[Before Sunset]]'', was released in 2004, and a third film, ''[[Before Midnight]]'', was released in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nOn June 16, 1994, Jesse meets C\u00e9line on a train from [[Budapest]], and they strike up a conversation. Jesse is going to [[Vienna]] to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas C\u00e9line is returning to university in [[Paris]] after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse asks C\u00e9line to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her significant other and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked someone else. Alternatively, she may just realize Jesse himself is not that different from the rest. Lacking the money to rent a room for the night, they decide to roam around in Vienna until Jesse's flight the next morning.\n\nAfter visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the [[Wiener Riesenrad]] at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of Vienna. C\u00e9line tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she \"loved him too much\". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in [[Madrid]], but they broke up soon after he was there. He found a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a [[Eurail]] pass and traveled around Europe.\n\nWhen they are walking alongside the [[Donaukanal]], they are approached by a man who offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice inside. Jesse and C\u00e9line decide on the word \"milkshake\", and are soon presented with the poem ''Delusion Angel'' (written for the film by poet [[David Jewell (poet)|David Jewell]])\u2014a poem that Jesse cynically claims the man had already previously written and just inserts the words people choose. In a [[Viennese caf\u00e9]], Jesse and C\u00e9line stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other's friends they pretend to call. C\u00e9line reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life.\n\nThey admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again. They decide to make the best of what time they have left, with the film leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not they had sex. At that point, Jesse explains that, if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. The film ends the next day at the [[Wien Westbahnhof|train station]], where, just as C\u00e9line's train is about to leave, the couple decides not to exchange any contact information but instead meet at the same place in six months.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jesse\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as C\u00e9line\n* [[Andrea Eckert]] as Wife on Train\n* [[Hanno P\u00f6schl]] as Husband on Train\n* Karl Bruckschwaiger as Man on Bridge #1\n* Tex Rubinowitz as Man on Bridge #2\n* [[Erni Mangold]] as Palm Reader\n* Dominik Castell as Street Poet\n* Haymon Maria Buttinger as Bartender\n* Bilge Jeschim as Belly Dancer\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Man Sleeping on Train (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Before Sunrise'' was inspired by a woman named Amy Lehrhaupt,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb0Q7QyvrHM  Youtube profile of Lehrhaupt by Jeff Rowan uploaded 15 Feb 2015]</ref> whom writer/director [[Richard Linklater]] met in a toy shop in [[Philadelphia]] in 1989.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite news | last = Thompson | first = Ben | title = The First Kiss Takes So Long | work = [[Sight and Sound]] | date = May 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/05/30/before_sunrise_inspiration_before_midnight_is_dedicated_to_amy_lehrhaupt.html|title=The Real Couple Behind Before Sunrise|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|work=Slate|date=May 30, 2013 |access-date=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref> They walked around the city together, conversing deep into the night.

Linklater realized that because the film is so much a dialogue between a man and a woman, it was important to have a strong female co-writer. He chose [[Kim Krizan]], who had small roles in his two previous films ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' and ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]''.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> According to Linklater, he \"loved the way her mind worked \u2013 a constant stream of confident and intelligent ideas\".<ref name=\"Linklater\">{{cite news | last = Linklater | first = Richard |author2=Kim Krizan | title = ''Before Sunrise'' | pages = V | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | date = March 1995 }}</ref>\n\nLinklater and Krizan talked about the concept of the film and the characters for a long time.<ref name=\"Linklater\"/> He wanted to explore the \"relationship side of life and discover two people who had complete anonymity and try to find out who they really were\".<ref name=\"Donahue\">{{cite news | last = Donahue | first = Christina| title = Love in the Aftermath | work = [[Film Threat]] | date = April 1995 }}</ref> He decided to put Jesse and C\u00e9line in a foreign country because \"when you're traveling, you're much more open to experiences outside your usual realm\".<ref name=\"Donahue\"/> He and Krizan worked on an outline.

They are underlined by the poem \"''Delusion Angel''\", which evokes a longing for complete and unifying, possibly even redeeming, understanding between two partners in a world which is itself unknowable, and over which one can exercise no control.\n\nAn important role is played by the theme of spontaneous and uninhibited response to one's environment. It is reflected by the actions of Jesse and C\u00e9line, whose joint [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], initiated by a previously unmeditated decision to leave the train together, allows them to temporarily detach themselves from the world, and enter a realm where only the other's company is of importance. Come morning, Jesse remarks that he and C\u00e9line have again entered \"real time\".<ref>Intertextual references highlight, and potentially expand, the notion of spontaneity. While on the train, C\u00e9line and Jesse read books that are suggestive of behavior patterns in which experience takes precedence over rationality. C\u00e9line reads a [[George Bataille]] anthology: ''Madame Edwarda'', ''Le Mort'' (The Dead Man), and ''Histoire de L'Oeil'' (The Story of the Eye); Jesse reads [[Klaus Kinski]]'s autobiography, ''All I Need Is Love''.</ref>\n\nIt could be argued that ''Before Sunrise'' subsumes its main themes under that of [[life]]. In one scene, C\u00e9line and Jesse visit the Friedhof der Namenlosen, the Cemetery of the Nameless in [[Simmering (Vienna)|Simmering]]. The people buried in the cemetery have found anonymity in death; by learning to know and understand one another, C\u00e9line and Jesse experience and embrace life, suspending their own mortality.<ref>Cf.
