Based on the 1958 play by [[Robert Thomas (director)|Robert Thomas]], it features an [[ensemble cast]] of high-profile French actresses that includes [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]], [[Fanny Ardant]], [[Virginie Ledoyen]], [[Danielle Darrieux]], [[Ludivine Sagnier]] and [[Firmine Richard]]. Revolving around an eccentric family of women and their employees in the 1950s, the film follows eight women as they gather to celebrate [[Christmas]] in an isolated, snowbound cottage only to find Marcel, the family [[patriarch]], dead with a knife in his back. Trapped in the house, every woman becomes a suspect, each having her own motive and secret.\n\nOzon initially envisioned a [[remake]] of [[George Cukor]]'s film ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), but eventually settled on Thomas's ''Huit femmes'' after legal obstacles prevented him from doing so. Drawing inspiration from Cukor's [[Screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] of the late 1930s and the 1950s work of directors such as [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Vincente Minnelli]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''8 Women'' blends [[farce]], [[melodrama]], [[Musical film|musical]], and [[Mystery film|murder-mystery film]] while addressing murder, [[greed]], [[adultery]], and [[homosexuality]]. Set primarily in the entry hall of a manor house, the film recreates much of the play's original [[Chamber play|theatrical feel]]. It also serves as a pastiche of and homage to the [[history of film]] and the actresses' [[filmographies]].\n\nThe film's premiere was held on 8 January 2002 in [[Paris]], where filming had taken place. ''8 Women'' competed for the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[52nd Berlin International Film Festival]], where its all-female cast was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution.<ref>[https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2002/03_preistr_ger_2002/03_Preistraeger_2002.html Berlinale.

Retrieved 26 January 2002</ref> Released to generally positive reviews, with major praise for the stars, the film was nominated for twelve [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s, including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. At the 2002 [[European Film Awards]], the film was nominated for six awards, including [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[European Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]]; it won for [[European Film Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for the eight principal actresses. It was also selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category at the [[75th Academy Awards]], but was not nominated.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in the 1950s in a large country residence as a family and its servants are preparing for [[Christmas]]. When the master of the house is discovered dead in his bed with a dagger in his back, it is presumed that the murderer must be one of the eight women in the house. Over the course of the investigation, each woman has a tale to tell and secrets to hide.\n\nThe film opens with Suzon returning from school for Christmas break, finding her mother Gaby, her younger sister Catherine, and her [[wheelchair]]-bound grandmother Mamy in the living room, where most of the action of the film takes place. Their conversation drifts to the subject of the patriarch of the family, Marcel, and Catherine leads the first song of the film, \"[[Papa t'es plus dans l'coup|Papa t'es plus dans le coup]]\" (roughly, \"Dad, you're out of touch\"). The singing wakes up Suzon and Catherine's aunt Augustine, who initiates arguments with the rest of the family and the two servants (Madame Chanel and Louise), eventually returning upstairs and threatening to commit [[suicide]]. Mamy jumps out of her wheelchair trying to stop her, haphazardly explaining her ability to walk as a \"Christmas miracle.\" Augustine is eventually calmed down, and she sings her song of longing, \"[[Message personnel]]\" (Personal Message).\n\nThe maid takes a tray upstairs, finds Marcel's stabbed body, and screams. Catherine goes up to see what has happened and locks the door. The others finally go up to Marcel's room to see him stabbed in the back. Catherine tells the others that they should not disturb the room until the police arrive, so they re-lock the door. Realizing that the dogs did not bark the night before the incident, it becomes clear that the murderer was known to the dogs and therefore must be one of the women in the house. Attempting to call the authorities, they find that the telephone line has been cut, so they will have to go in person to the police station. Before they can do so, the women are distracted by the announcement that someone is roaming the garden, someone whom the guard dogs are not chasing. The person turns out to be Marcel's sister Pierrette, a [[nightclub singer]] who is also rumored to be a prostitute, and who has not been allowed into the house before due to Gaby's dislike for her. When questioned, she claims that she received a mysterious telephone call in which she was informed that her brother was dead. She sings \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (What's the point of living free?), commenting on her sexual freedom.\n\nIt is realized that she has been to the house before, as the dogs did not bark and she knew immediately which room belonged to her brother, making her the eighth potential killer. The women try to start the car, and find that it has been sabotaged, cutting them off from help until the storm subsides and they can hitchhike to town. The women spend their time trying to identify the murderer amongst them. It is learned that Suzon returned the night before to tell her father in secret that she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. She sings a song to Catherine, \"[[Mon amour, mon ami]]\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\"), about her lover; however, she was sexually abused by her father. We later learn that Suzon is not Marcel's child but is the child of Gaby's first great love who was killed not long after the child was conceived; every time Gaby looks at Suzon she is reminded of her love for him.\n\nSuspicion then swings to Madame Chanel, the housekeeper, whose actions the night before seem suspicious. It is revealed that she had been having an affair with Pierrette, who went to see her brother that night to ask for money to pay off her debts. When some members of the family react in outrage to the fact that she is a [[lesbian]], Madame Chanel retreats to the kitchen, and sings \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (So as to not live alone).\n\nIn the meantime we find out that Mamy, Suzon and Catherine's \"old and sick\" grandmother, not only can walk but also possesses some valuable stock shares that could have saved Marcel from his bankruptcy. Out of greed, she lied that her shares had been stolen by someone who knew where she was hiding them. The spotlight moves to Louise, the new maid, who is found out to be Marcel's mistress. She declares affection for Gaby, but also expresses disappointment in her for her weakness and indecision. She sings \"[[Pile ou face]]\" (literally \"Heads or Tails\", but referring to the ups and downs of life), and removes the symbols of her servitude, her maid's cap and apron, asserting herself as an equal to the other women. Gaby sings \"Toi Jamais\" (Never You), about Marcel, saying that he never paid enough attention to her, while other men did. It is revealed that she had an affair with Marcel's business partner, Jacques Farneaux, the same man who has been having an affair with Pierrette. The two women get into a fight that turns into a passionate make-out session on the living room floor, a scene which the others walk in on and are stunned by.\n\nEventually, Madame Chanel discovers the solution to the mystery, but she is silenced by a gunshot. While not struck by the bullet, she becomes mute out of shock. Catherine takes the lead, revealing that she hid in her father's closet from where she saw all the other women talk to Marcel the night before. She explains the mystery: Marcel faked his own death, with her help, to see what was really going on in his house. She says that he is now free of the other women's clutches and rushes to his bedroom only to witness Marcel shoot himself in the head. Mamy closes the film with the song \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (There is no happy love) as the women clasp hands and face the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Danielle Darrieux]] as Mamy, the [[matriarch]]\n* [[Isabelle Huppert]] as Augustine, her [[tachycardia]]c daughter\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Gaby, her other daughter, the victim's wife\n* [[Fanny Ardant]] as Pierrette, the victim's sister\n* [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art]] as Louise, the new chambermaid\n* [[Virginie Ledoyen]] as Suzon, the victim's elder daughter\n* [[Ludivine Sagnier]] as Catherine, the victim's younger daughter\n* [[Firmine Richard]] as Madame Chanel, the cook\n* Dominique Lamure as Marcel, the victim, Gaby's husband\n* [[Romy Schneider]] as the chambermaid's previous mistress (the photograph)\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"[[Papa t'es plus dans l'coup|Papa t'es plus dans le coup]]\" (\"Dad, You're Out of Touch\") \u2013 Catherine and Company\n# \"[[Message personnel]]\" (\"Personal Message\") \u2013 Augustine\n# \"A quoi sert de vivre libre\" (\"What's the Point of Living Free?\") \u2013 Pierrette\n# \"[[Mon amour, mon ami]]\" (\"My Lover, My Friend\") \u2013 Suzon\n# \"Pour ne pas vivre seul\" (\"So as Not to Live Alone\") \u2013 Madame Chanel\n# \"[[Pile ou face]]\" (\"Heads or Tails / Ups and Downs\") \u2013 Louise\n# \"Toi jamais\" (\"Never You\") \u2013 Gaby\n# \"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\" (\"There is No Happy Love\") \u2013 Mamy\n\n==Production==\nOzon was inspired by the 1950s [[Ross Hunter]] productions of [[Douglas Sirk]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]].
