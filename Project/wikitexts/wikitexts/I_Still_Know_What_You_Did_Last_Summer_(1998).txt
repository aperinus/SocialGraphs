[[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] and [[Muse Watson]] reprise their roles, with [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Mekhi Phifer]] and [[Matthew Settle]] joining the cast. It is the second installment in the [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (franchise)|''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' franchise]]. The film takes place one year after the events of [[I Know What You Did Last Summer|its predecessor]], and was shot in [[Mexico]] and [[California]].\n\nIt received negative reviews and grossed $40 million on a budget of $24 million. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the brutal murders of her friends, [[Helen Shivers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) and Barry Cox ([[Ryan Phillippe]]), by the vengeful fisherman Ben Willis ([[Muse Watson]]), Julie James ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) is attending summer classes in [[Boston]], but suffers from nightmares of the murders. Julie's roommate, Karla Wilson ([[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]), receives a phone call from a local radio station and wins a vacation for four to [[The Bahamas]]. Julie invites her boyfriend, Ray Bronson ([[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]), who declines, but later changes his mind. That evening, Ray and his co-worker, Dave ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]), drive to Boston to surprise Julie, but stop due to a body in the middle of the road. When Ray discovers the body is a mannequin, Ben appears and kills Dave with his hook, then chases Ray in a truck, but Ray escapes and falls down a hill.\n\nThe next morning, Julie, Karla, Karla's boyfriend, Tyrell Martin ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), and their friend, Will Benson ([[Matthew Settle]]), depart for the trip. The group arrives at the hotel in Tower Bay and checks in. That evening at the hotel's bar, Julie is singing [[karaoke]] when the words \"I still know what you did last summer\" roll onto the screen. Terrified, she runs back to her room. At the dock, Darick, the dockhand ([[Benjamin Brown (actor)|Benjamin Brown]]), is tying up the boat. He is killed by Ben. Olga (Ellerine Harding), the housekeeper, finds bloody sheets while working and is then killed by Ben. While the others get into the hot tub, Julie is in her room and notices that her toothbrush is missing. She searches her room before finding Darick dead in the closet. She finds her friends and they return to find no sign of Darick's body; Mr. Brooks ([[Jeffrey Combs]]), the hotel manager, refuses to believe her story. By the pool, Titus Telesco ([[Jack Black]]) is murdered. Ray, who has survived his injuries, heads out to rescue Julie.\n\nThe next day, the group finds Olga, Titus, and Mr. Brooks murdered and the [[two-way radio]], their only way of contact, destroyed. Isolated, the group goes to the room of Estes ([[Bill Cobbs]]), the boat hand porter, and finds that he has been using [[Black magic#Voodoo|voodoo]] against them. Estes appears, explaining he was trying to protect them after realizing that their answer to the radio station's question was incorrect. He tells them that Ben and his wife, Sarah, had two children: a son and a daughter. Ben murdered Sarah when he found out about an affair. Estes goes missing and Will volunteers to find him, while Ray takes a boat to the island. Julie, Karla, and Tyrell return to the hotel and find Nancy ([[Jennifer Esposito]]), the bartender, hiding in the kitchen.\n\nBen appears in the kitchen and kills Tyrell. The girls retreat to the attic, where Karla is attacked by Ben. Julie and Nancy rescue Karla and run to the storm cellar, where they find Ben's victims. Will bursts in and takes the girls back to the hotel, stating that he saw Ben on the beach. At the hotel, Will tells them that Estes attacked him and he is bleeding from the stomach. Nancy and Karla leave to find a [[first aid kit]], but find Estes impaled with a [[harpoon]]. Ben appears, kills Nancy and attacks Karla. While Julie tends to Will, he reveals that it is not his blood and asks Julie what her favorite radio station is, revealing that he was the radio host and had killed Estes.\n\nWill drags Julie to a graveyard, where he reveals that he is Ben's son. Ben appears and attacks Julie before Ray arrives and engages in a fight with Will. When Ben tries to stab Ray, he accidentally kills Will instead. While Ben is distraught from killing his son, Julie shoots him dead. Back at the hotel, Karla is found alive and they are rescued by the [[coast guard]].\n\nSometime later, Ray and Julie get married and buy a home. Ray is brushing his teeth and the bathroom door is locked while he is occupied. Julie sits down on the bed and looks in the mirror, seeing Ben underneath. She screams as Ben pulls her under the bed, which ends the movie, thus leaving the audience questioning if the attack was real or just another of Julie's nightmares.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as Julie James\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Ray Bronson\n* [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] as Karla Wilson\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Tyrell Martin\n* [[Matthew Settle]] as Will Benson/Willis\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Nancy\n* [[Muse Watson]] as Ben Willis / The Fisherman\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Estes\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Mr. Brooks\n* [[Benjamin Brown (actor)|Benjamin Brown]] as Darick the Dockhand\n* Ellerine Harding as Olga \n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Dave \n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Helen Shivers (uncredited) (photo)\n* [[Jack Black]] as Titus Telesco (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/07/09/i-still-know-what-you-did-last-summer-blu-ray-review|title=I Still Know What You Did Last Summer Blu-ray Review|work=IGN|date=9 Jul 2009|access-date=2 August 2020|quote=Jack Black also chimes in with an uncredited cameo.
