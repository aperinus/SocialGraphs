It is based on the true story of the [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven#Guildford Four|Guildford Four]], four people falsely convicted of the 1974 [[Guildford pub bombings]] which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Pallister | first=David | title=An injustice that still reverberates | work=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/19/davidpallister1 | date=19 October 1999 | access-date=12 July 2011}}</ref> The screenplay was adapted by [[Terry George]] and Jim Sheridan from the 1990 autobiography ''Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four'' by [[Gerry Conlon]].<ref>''[[The Irish Filmography]] 1896-1996''; Red Mountain Press; 1996. Page 59.</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $65 million at the box office and received overwhelmingly positive reviews. It was nominated for seven Oscars at the [[66th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] ([[Daniel Day-Lewis]]), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] ([[Emma Thompson]]), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Belfast]], [[Gerry Conlon]] is mistaken for an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[sniper]] by British security forces and pursued until a [[riot]] breaks out. Gerry is sent to [[London, England|London]] by his father Giuseppe to dissuade an IRA reprisal against him. \n\nOne evening, Gerry burgles a prostitute's flat and steals \u00a3700. While he is taking drugs in a park with his friend Paul Hill, alongside homeless Irishman Charlie Burke, [[Guildford pub bombings|an explosion in Guildford]] occurs, killing four off-duty soldiers plus a civilian as well as injuring many others. Returning to Belfast some time later, Gerry is captured by the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nGerry is flown to [[Great Britain|the UK mainland]], where he and his friend Paul, as well as two others are dubbed the [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]] are subjected to police torture as part of [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|their interrogation]]. \n\nGerry maintains his innocence, but signs a [[forced confession|confession]] after the police threaten to kill his father, who is later arrested along with other members of the Conlon family, later dubbed the [[Maguire Seven]]. At his trial, although Gerry's defence points out numerous inconsistencies in the police investigation, he, along with the rest of the Guildford Four, is sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nDuring their time in prison Gerry and Giuseppe are approached by new inmate Joe McAndrew, who informs them that he was the real perpetrator of the bombing and had confessed this to the police. They, in order to save face, withheld this new information. \n\nThough Gerry warms to Joe, his opinion changes when Joe sets a hated prison guard on fire during a riot. Giuseppe later dies in custody, leaving Gerry to take over his father's campaign for justice.\n\nGiuseppe's lawyer [[Gareth Peirce]], who had been investigating the case on Giuseppe's behalf, discovers vital evidence related to Gerry's original alibi with a note attached that reads, \"Not to be shown to the defense.\" Through a statement made by Charlie Burke, at a court appeal, it totally exonerates Gerry and the rest. \n\nThe film ends with the current activities of the wrongly accused, but also that the police who investigated the case were never prosecuted for any wrongdoing. The real perpetrators of the Guildford Bombing have not been charged with the crime.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[Gerry Conlon|Gerard Patrick \"Gerry\" Conlon]]\n*[[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Patrick \"Giuseppe\" Conlon\n*[[Emma Thompson]] as [[Gareth Peirce]]\n*[[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] as [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Paul Hill]]\n*[[Corin Redgrave]] as Inspector Robert Dixon\n*[[Beatie Edney]] as [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Carole Richardson]]\n*[[John Benfield]] as Chief PO Barker\n*[[Paterson Joseph]] as Benbay\n*[[Marie Jones]] as [[Sarah Conlon]]\n*[[Gerard McSorley]] as Detective Pavis\n*[[Frank Harper]] as Ronnie Smalls\n*[[Mark Sheppard]] as [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Patrick Joseph \"Paddy\" Armstrong]]\n*[[Don Baker (musician)|Don Baker]] as Joe McAndrew \n*[[Tom Wilkinson (actor)|Tom Wilkinson]] as an Appeal Prosecutor\n{{div col end}}\n\nModel, now actress, [[Saffron Burrows]] made her feature film debut in the film, as Gerry Conlon's [[free love]]-interest at a commune/squat in London at the time of the bombings.\n\n==Production==\nTo prepare for the role of Gerry Conlon, Day-Lewis lost over 50 pounds in weight. To gain an insight into Conlon's thoughts and feelings at the time, Day-Lewis also spent three days and nights in a jail cell. He was prevented from sleeping by a group of thugs, who would bang on the door every ten minutes with tin cups through the night, then was interrogated by three different teams of real Special Branch officers for nine hours. He would also insist that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him. He also kept his Belfast accent on and off set.\n\nDay-Lewis has stated in an interview that he went through all this as \"How could I understand how an innocent man could sign that confession and destroy his own life.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4qRs2U_890| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/H4qRs2U_890| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=Daniel Day-Lewis - 'Movies 101' Part 3|last=EmmaGennaro|date=7 May 2008|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKfGU3vKjvc| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/RKfGU3vKjvc| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|title=Daniel Day-Lewis - 'Movies 101' Part 4|last=EmmaGennaro|date=8 May 2008|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received very positive reviews from most critics.

Jim Sheridan was forced to defend his choices. In 2003, he stated: \"I was accused of lying in ''In the Name of the Father'', but the real lie was saying it was a film about the Guildford Four when really it was about a non-violent parent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/oct/12/features.review27|title=In the pain of the father|first=Stephanie|last=Merritt|date=11 October 2003|via=The Guardian}}</ref>  In the film we see Gerry and his father Giuseppe (in the closing credits, the name is misspelled 'Guiseppe') sharing a cell, but this never took place; they were usually kept in separate prisons. The courtroom scenes featuring Gareth Peirce were also heavily criticised as clearly straying from recorded events and established English legal practices since, as a [[solicitor]] and not a [[barrister]], she would not have been able to appear in court at the time. Furthermore, Peirce did not represent Giuseppe Conlon. Investigative journalist [[David Pallister]] wrote, \"The myriad absurdities in the court scenes, straight out of ''[[L.A.
