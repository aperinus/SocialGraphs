It stars [[Matthew Broderick]] as Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]], the regiment's commanding officer, and [[Denzel Washington]], [[Cary Elwes]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] as fictional members of the 54th. The screenplay by [[Kevin Jarre]] was based on the books ''Lay This Laurel'' (1973) by [[Lincoln Kirstein]] and ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' (1965) by [[Peter Burchard]] and the personal letters of Shaw. The film depicts the soldiers of the 54th from the formation of their regiment to their heroic actions at the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]].\n\n''Glory'' was co-produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Freddie Fields|Freddie Fields Productions]], and distributed by Tri-Star Pictures in the United States. It premiered in limited release in the United States on December 14, 1989, and in wide release on February 16, 1990, grossing $27 million worldwide on an $18 million budget. The film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]] and won three, including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Washington. It also won awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, the Political Film Society, and the [[NAACP Image Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being wounded at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Robert Gould Shaw]] is sent home to [[Boston]] on [[medical leave]]. His well-connected father obtains for him a promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. Shaw appoints his friend and fellow soldier Cabot Forbes as his second-in-command. Their first volunteer is Thomas Searles, a bookish, free [[African Americans|African-American]] who works as the Shaw family's secretary. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Silas Trip, and a [[muteness|mute]] teenage drummer boy whom Rawlins refers to as \"Honey\".\n\nThe men learn that in response to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] has issued an order that captured black men are to be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found wearing uniforms will be [[summarily executed|executed]] as well as their white officers. Shaw offers honorable discharges to any man who does not want to fight, but no one takes his offer. The men undergo rigorous training from Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, who is particularly hard on Searles. Despite Mulcahy's treatment of his friend and the abuse he inflicts on the other recruits, Shaw reluctantly accepts that tough discipline is needed to prepare them for the coming challenges the regiment must face.\n\nTrip [[AWOL|deserts]] and is caught; Shaw orders him [[flogged]] in front of the regiment. He then learns that Trip left to find proper shoes because his men are being denied these supplies. Shaw confronts the base's racist [[quartermaster]] on their behalf and gets the supplies. He also supports his men in a pay dispute; the [[U.S. Government|federal government]] decrees that black soldiers will only be paid $10, not the $13 per month all white soldiers receive. When the men, led by Trip, begin tearing up their pay vouchers in protest of this unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own voucher and declares that none of the white officers will accept pay. In recognition of the leadership he has displayed, Rawlins is promoted to the rank of [[sergeant major]].\n\nOnce the 54th completes its training, the unit is transferred to serve under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Garrison Harker|Charles Harker]]. On their first mission, the 54th is ordered by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] to sack and burn [[Darien, Georgia]] with Montgomery's own poorly disciplined black soldiers. Shaw initially refuses to [[Superior orders|obey an unlawful order]] but reluctantly agrees under threat of facing a [[court-martial]] and being relieved of his command. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his regiment to fight after weeks of having nothing to do but backbreaking manual labor.\n\nShaw finally gets the 54th a combat assignment after he blackmails Harker and Montgomery by threatening to inform the [[United States Department of Defense|War Department]] of their involvement in illegal [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]]. In its first battle at [[Battle of Grimball's Landing|James Island, South Carolina]], the 54th successfully repels a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Trip from being stabbed in the back. Shaw offers Trip the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, unsure if winning the war would result in a better life for ex-slaves like himself.\n\n[[George Crockett Strong|General George Strong]] informs Shaw along with his fellow commanders of [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|a major campaign]] to secure a foothold at [[Charleston Harbor]]. This involves assaulting [[Morris Island]] and capturing [[Fort Wagner]], whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches, including Trip, who finally embraces his fellow soldiers. On its way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.\n\nThe 54th leads the charge on the fort at dusk, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the fort's walls. Attempting to encourage his men forward, Shaw is struck by several bullets and killed. Trip, despite his previous assertion that he would not do it, lifts the flag and tries to rally the men before being shot dead. Forbes and Rawlins take charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's outer defenses. Seemingly on the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two [[Colour sergeant|color sergeants]] realize that the enemy has cannons pointed right at them. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with the bodies of black and white Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass communal grave, with Shaw and Trip's bodies next to each other.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals that the regiment lost over half its number during the assault and that Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army. However, the courage demonstrated by the 54th spurred [[United States Congress|Congress]] to authorize the raising of black soldiers throughout the Union. Over 180,000 volunteered and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| width = \n| total_width = 400\n| image1 = Robert Gould Shaw.jpg\n| width1 = 217\n| height1 = 240\n| caption1 = Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]] in May 1863\n| image2 = Matthew Broderick.jpg\n| width2 = 186\n| height2 = 240\n| caption2 = Matthew Broderick portrayed Shaw in ''Glory''.\n}}\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]]\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Private Silas Trip\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Major Cabot Forbes \n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Sergeant Major John Rawlins\n* [[Andre Braugher]] as Corporal Thomas Searles\n* Jihmi Kennedy as Private Jupiter Sharts \n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]]\n* [[Alan North]] as [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John Albion Andrew]]\n* [[John Finn]] as Sergeant Major Mulcahy\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as 10th Connecticut Soldier\n* [[RonReaco Lee]] as Mute Drummer Boy\n* [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] as Captain [[Charles Fessenden Morse]]\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as General [[Charles Garrison Harker]]\n* [[Jay O.
