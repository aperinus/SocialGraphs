The documentary examines the modern-day [[corporation]]. Bakan wrote the book, ''The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power'', during the filming of the documentary.\n\nA sequel film, ''[[The New Corporation: The Unfortunately Necessary Sequel]]'', was released in 2020.<ref>Pat Mullen, [http://povmagazine.com/blog/view/inconvenient-indian-new-corporation-no-ordinary-man-rep-canadian-docs-in-ti \"\u2018Inconvenient Indian\u2019, \u2018New Corporation\u2019, \u2018No Ordinary Man\u2019 Rep Canadian Docs in TIFF Line-up\"]. ''[[Point of View (magazine)|Point of View]]'', July 30, 2020.</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a [[Legal person|legal entity]] that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to affect specific public functions to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. The documentary concentrates mostly upon corporations in [[North America]], especially in the United States. One theme is its assessment of corporations as persons, as a result of [[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.|an 1886 case]] in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which a statement by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]]<ref group=\"nb\">\"The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\" However, the Supreme Court decision did not itself address the matter of whether corporations were \"persons\" with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment; in [[Chief Justice Waite]]'s words, \"we avoided meeting the question\". (118 U.S. 394 (1886) \u2013 According to the official court Syllabus in the ''[[United States Reports]]'')</ref> led to corporations as \"persons\" having the same rights as human beings, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n \nTopics addressed include the [[Business Plot]], where in 1933, General [[Smedley Butler]] exposed an alleged corporate plot against then U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]; the [[tragedy of the commons]]; [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s warning people to beware of the rising [[military\u2013industrial complex]]; economic [[externality|externalities]]; suppression of an investigative news story about [[Bovine Growth Hormone]] on  [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate television station [[WTVT]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], at the behest of [[Monsanto]]; the invention of the soft drink [[Fanta]] by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] due to the trade embargo on [[Nazi Germany]]; the alleged role of [[IBM]] in the [[The Holocaust|Nazi holocaust]] (see [[IBM and the Holocaust]]); the [[Cochabamba Water War|Cochabamba protests of 2000]] brought on by the [[privatization]] of a municipal [[water supply]] in [[Bolivia]]; and in general themes of [[corporate social responsibility]], the notion of [[limited liability]], the corporation as a psychopath, and the debate about [[corporate personhood]].\n\nThrough vignettes and interviews, ''The Corporation'' examines and criticizes corporate business practices. The film's assessment is affected via the diagnostic criteria in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-IV'']]; [[Robert D. Hare]], a [[University of British Columbia]] psychology professor and a consultant to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] (however, Hare has objected to the manner in which his views are portrayed in the film; see \"[[#Critical reception|Critical reception]]\" below).  ''The Corporation'' attempts to compare the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave with what it claims are the ''DSM-IV''{{'}}s symptoms of psychopathy, e.g., the callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, the reckless disregard for the safety of others, the deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), the incapacity to experience [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and the failure to conform to [[social norm]]s and respect the [[law]].\n\n===Interviews===\nThe film features interviews with prominent corporate critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Charles Kernaghan]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Vandana Shiva]], and [[Howard Zinn]], as well as opinions from [[chief executive officer]]s such as [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]] (from [[Interface, Inc.]]), business guru [[Peter Drucker]], Nobel laureate economist [[Milton Friedman]], and [[think tank]]s advocating free markets such as the [[Fraser Institute]]. Interviews also feature Dr. [[Samuel Epstein (physician)|Samuel Epstein]], who was involved in a lawsuit against [[Monsanto]] for promoting the use of Posilac, ([[trade name]] for recombinant [[Bovine somatotropin]]) to induce more milk production in [[dairy cattle]] and [[Chris Barrett (filmmaker)|Chris Barrett]] who, as a spokesperson for [[First USA]], was the first corporately sponsored college student in America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/19/nyregion/and-now-a-word-from-their-cool-college-sponsor.html|title= And Now a Word From Their Cool College Sponsor|work=www.nytimes.com |date= July 19, 2001 |access-date=2017-05-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Joel Bakan]], the author of the award-winning book ''The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power'', writes:\n \n{{blockquote|The law forbids any motivation for their actions, whether to assist workers, improve the environment, or help consumers save money.

It suggests that the idea for an organization as a psychopathic entity originated with [[Max Weber]], in regards to [[government]] [[bureaucracy]]. The reviewer remarks that the film weighs heavily in favor of [[public ownership]] as a solution to the evils depicted, while failing to acknowledge the magnitude of evils committed by governments ''in the name'' of [[public ownership]], such as those of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2647328 The lunatic you work for], review in ''[[The Economist]]'', May 6, 2004</ref>\n\nAn interview clip with psychiatrist [[Robert D. Hare]] appears for several minutes in ''The Corporation''. A pioneer in psychopathy research whose [[Hare Psychopathy Checklist]] is used in part to \"diagnose\" purportedly [[psychopathic]] behavior of corporations in the documentary, Hare has since objected to the manner in which his work was presented in the film and the use of his work to bolster what he describes as the film's questionable thesis and conclusions. In ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' (2007; co-written with Paul Babiak), Hare writes that despite claims by the filmmakers to him during production that they were using psychopathy [[metaphorically]] to describe \"the most egregious\" corporate misbehavior, the finished documentary obviously intends to imply that corporations in general or by definition are psychopathic, a claim that Hare emphatically rejects:\n{{Quotation|To refer to ''the'' corporation as psychopathic because of the behaviors of a carefully selected group of companies is like using the traits and behaviors of the most serious high-risk criminals to conclude that ''the'' criminal (that is, all criminals) is a psychopath.
