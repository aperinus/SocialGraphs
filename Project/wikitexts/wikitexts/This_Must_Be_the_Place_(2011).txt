The film deals with a middle-aged wealthy rock star who becomes bored in his retirement and takes on the quest of finding his father's tormentor, a [[Nazi]] war criminal who is a refugee in the United States.\n\nThe film was an Italian-majority production with co-producers in France and Ireland. Principal photography began in August, 2010. Filming took place in Ireland and Italy, as well as the states of Michigan, New Mexico, and New York. The film was in competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nCheyenne is a wealthy former rock star, now bored and jaded in his 20-year retirement in Dublin. He retired after two of his teenaged fans committed suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/11/movie-review-this-must-be-the-place.html|title=Movie Review: There's Method to This Must Be the Place's Madness|last=Ebiri|first=Belge|date=2012-11-02|website=www.vulture.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> He travels to New York to reconcile with his estranged father during his final hours, only to arrive too late. The reason he gives for not communicating with his father for 30 years was that his father rejected him when he put on [[goth subculture|goth]] make-up at the age of 15. He reads his father's diary and learns about his father's persecution in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] at the hands of former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer Alois Lange. He visits a professional [[Nazi hunter]] named Mordecai Midler who tells him that Lange is small fry.\n\nCheyenne begins a journey across the United States to track down Lange. Cheyenne finds the wife of Lange, Lange's granddaughter and a businessman. He buys a large gun. At the gun shop, a bystander delivers a soliloquy about a certain type of pistol that allows people to \"kill with impunity,\" and given that ability, \"if we\u2019re licensed to be monsters we end up having just one desire \u2013 to truly be monsters.\"\n\nWhen Cheyenne eventually tracks Lange down with the aid of Mordecai, Lange, now blind, says that he received mail from Cheyenne's father for decades. Lange recounts the incident that led to Cheyenne's father's obsession with Lange, in which Cheyenne's father peed his pants from fear. Lange describes this as a \"minor incident\" in comparison to the true horrors of Auschwitz, but mentions that he came to admire the man's single-minded determination to dedicate his life to making his own miserable. Cheyenne takes a photo of Lange and whispers that it was an injustice for his father to die before Lange did. Cheyenne forces the old blind man to walk out into the salt flats naked, like a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victim; skin and bones and numb with fear. Cheyenne and Mordecai drive away soon afterwards, leaving him still standing in the flats.\n\nCheyenne travels home by airplane (something he previously feared), cuts his rock-star hair and stops wearing his goth make-up, jewelry and outfits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Cheyenne\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Jane\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Mordecai Midler\n* [[Eve Hewson]] as Mary\n* [[Kerry Condon]] as Rachel\n* Grant Goodman as Tommy\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Robert Plath\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Dorothy Shore\n* [[David Byrne]] as himself\n* [[M\u00e1ir\u00edn O'Donovan]] as Woman in Bank\n* [[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Mary\u2019s mother\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Ernie Ray\n* Liron Levo as Richard\n* [[Heinz Lieven]] as Alois Lange\n* [[Simon Delaney]] as Jeffrey\n* Kristine Graverson as Shopper\n* Er Li Deng as Tai Chi master\n* [[Fritz Weaver]] as the voice of Cheyenne's deceased father\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Poster This Must Be the Place.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Teaser poster of This Must Be the Place.]] [[Paolo Sorrentino]] said [[Sean Penn]] told him he wanted to work with him after seeing Sorrentino's film ''[[Il Divo (film)|Il Divo]]'' at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]], where Penn headed the jury.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news |title = Sorrentino moves to $28 mil 'Place' |first = Nick |last = Vivarelli |url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118021429.html?categoryid=3599&cs=1 |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher = [[Reed Business Information]] |date = July 7, 2010 |accessdate = October 30, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106194657/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118021429.html?categoryid=3599&cs=1 |archivedate = November 6, 2012 |url-status = dead }}</ref> With Penn in mind, Sorrentino wrote the screenplay for ''This Must Be the Place'' with Umberto Contarello.<ref name=\"variety\" /> Sorrentino had for a long time been fascinated by Nazi war criminals who had managed to keep their former crimes secret, and went on to live ordinary lives. To add an element of irony to a story about such a person, Sorrentino came up with Penn's character: \"a slow, lazy, rock star who was bored enough and closed in his self-referential world to the point of being, seemingly, the last person who would embark on a crazy search for a Nazi criminal, probably dead by now, across the United States.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&aid=73&rid=4284686&sr=1&only=1&tpl=archnews|title=Interview: Paolo Sorrentino Talks 'This Must Be The Place' {{!}} The Irish Film & Television Network|website=www.iftn.ie|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Sorrentino was attracted to this juxtaposition as it would add a great risk of failure, which he considers vital for the prospect of a story to be good. In selecting the name of the rock star and his band, Sorrentino thought of what he considered the most inspired names in rock star history, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], and changed it into \"Cheyenne and the Fellows\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The look of the character was inspired by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Sorrentino had seen The Cure perform several times in his youth, and when he saw them again in 2008, he was fascinated by the fact that Smith, even off the stage, still wore the same kind of attire as in the past:\n\n{{blockquote|Here was a fifty-year-old who still completely identified with a look which, by definition, is that of an adolescent.
