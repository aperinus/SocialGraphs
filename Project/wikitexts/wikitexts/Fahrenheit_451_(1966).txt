Based on the 1953 [[Fahrenheit 451|novel of the same name]] by [[Ray Bradbury]], the film takes place in a controlled society in an oppressive future, in which the government sends out firemen to destroy all literature to prevent revolution and thinking. This was Truffaut's first colour film<ref name=\"timereview\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,828447,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204145711/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,828447,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 February 2013 |title=Out of Nothinkness |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=18 November 1966| access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref> and his only non French-language film.

Truffaut wrote in a letter, \"You mustn't think that 'Alphaville' will do any harm whatsoever to 'Fahrenheit'\",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fahrenheit 451 on Paper|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/fahrenheit-451-on-paper|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref> but he was mistaken.\n\nTruffaut's adaptation differed from the novel by portraying Montag and Clarisse falling in love. Another notable aspect of the film is that Julie Christie plays two characters, Clarisse and Montag's wife Mildred, whose name was changed to Linda in the adaptation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SparkNotes: Fahrenheit 451: Movie Adaptations|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/451/movie-adaptations/|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the future, a totalitarian government employs a force known as Firemen to seek out and destroy all literature. They have the power to search anyone, anywhere, at any time, and burn any books they find. One of the firemen, Guy Montag, meets one of his neighbours, Clarisse, a young schoolteacher who may be fired due to her unorthodox views. The two have a discussion about his job, where she asks whether he ever reads the books he burns. Curious, he begins to hide books in his house and read them, starting with [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[David Copperfield]]''. This leads to conflict with his wife, Linda, who is more concerned with being popular enough to be a member of ''The Family'', an interactive television programme that refers to its viewers as \"cousins\".\n\nAt the house of an illegal book collector, the fire captain, Beatty, talks with Montag at length about how books make people unhappy and make them want to think that they are better than others, which is considered anti-social. The book collector, an old woman who was seen with Clarisse a few times during Montag's rides to and from work, refuses to leave her house, opting instead to [[Death by burning|burn herself]] and the house, so that she can die with her books.\n\nReturning home that day, Montag tries to tell Linda and her friends about the woman who martyred herself in the name of books and confronts them about knowing anything about what's going on in the world, calling them ''[[zombie]]s'' and telling them that they're just ''killing time'' instead of living life. Disturbed over Montag's behaviour, Linda's friends try to leave, but Montag stops them by forcing them to sit and listen to him read a novel passage. During the reading, one of Linda's friends breaks down crying, aware of the feelings she repressed over the years, while Linda's other friends leave in disgust over Montag's alleged cruelty and the ''sick'' content of the novel.\n\nThat night, Montag dreams of Clarisse as the book collector who killed herself. The same night, Clarisse's house is raided, but she escapes through a trapdoor in the roof, thanks to her uncle. Montag breaks into Beatty's office, looking for information about the missing Clarisse, and is caught but not punished.\n\nMontag meets with Clarisse and helps her break back into her house to destroy papers that would bring the Firemen to others like her. She tells him of the \"book people\", a hidden sect of people who flout the law, each of whom has memorised a book to keep it alive. Later, Montag tells Beatty that he is resigning but is convinced to go on one more call, which turns out to be Montag's own house.\n\nLinda leaves the house, telling Montag that she couldn't live with his book obsession and leaves him to be punished by the Firemen. Angrily, he destroys the bedroom and television before setting fire to the books. Beatty lectures him about the books and pulls a last book from Montag's coat, for which Montag kills him with the flamethrower. He escapes and finds the book people, where he views his \"capture\" on television, staged to keep the masses entertained and because the government doesn't want it to be known that he is alive. Montag selects a book to memorise, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and becomes one of the book people.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Oskar Werner]] as [[Guy Montag]]\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Linda Montag/Clarisse\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as Captain Beatty\n* [[Anton Diffring]] as Fabian/Headmistress\n* [[Jeremy Spenser]] as Man with the Apple\n* Bee Duffell as Book woman\n* [[Gillian Lewis]] as Cousin Midge on TV\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nTruffaut kept a detailed diary during the production and later published in both French and English (in ''Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in English''). In this diary, he called ''Fahrenheit 451'' his \"saddest and most difficult\" film-making experience, mainly because of intense conflicts between Werner and himself.<ref>Insdorf 1995, p. 187.</ref><ref>Baecque 1999, p. 212.</ref>\n\nThe film was [[Universal Pictures]]' first European production. [[Julie Christie]] was originally cast as just Linda Montag, not both Linda and Clarisse. The part of Clarisse was offered to [[Jean Seberg]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. After much thought, Truffaut decided that the characters should not have a villain/hero relationship but rather be two sides of the same coin and cast Christie in both roles, although the idea came from the producer, [[Lewis M. Allen]].<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (Director) |title=Fahrenheit 451 Special Features |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal Pictures |date=2003 }}</ref>\n\nIn an interview from 1998, [[Charles Aznavour]] said that he was Truffaut's first choice to play the role given to Werner; Aznavour said that [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] was the director's second choice, but the producers refused on the grounds that both of them were not familiar enough for the English-speaking audience.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr070998.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000615205728/http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr070998.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2000 |title=Charles Aznavour |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=9 July 1998 |access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> [[Paul Newman]], [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were also considered for the role of Montag; [[Terence Stamp]] was cast but dropped out when he feared being overshadowed by Christie's dual roles in the film.<ref>Baecque 1999, p. 216.</ref> [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Sterling Hayden]] were considered for the role of the Captain, before Cyril Cusack was cast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, with the [[monorail]] exterior scene taken at the French [[SAFEGE]] test track in [[Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire]] near [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France (since dismantled). The film featured the [[Alton Estate|Alton housing estate]] in [[Roehampton]], south London, and also [[Edgcumbe Park]] in [[Crowthorne]], Berkshire. The final scene with the \"Book People\" reciting their chosen books was filmed at Black Park near Pinewood, in a rare and unexpected snowstorm that occurred on Julie Christie's birthday, 14 April 1966.<ref name=\"dvdcom\">{{cite video |people=Julie Christie (Actress) |title=Fahrenheit 451 Commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal Pictures |date=2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe production work was done in French, as Truffaut spoke virtually no English but co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jean-Louis Richard]]. Truffaut expressed disappointment with the often stilted and unnatural English-language dialogue. He was much happier with the version that was dubbed into French.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nThe movie's opening credits are spoken rather than displayed in type, which might be the director's hint of what life would be like in an illiterate culture. [[Tony Walton]] did costumes and production design, while [[Syd Cain]] did art direction.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nIn 1971, some scenes from ''Fahrenheit 451'' were used in ''The Different Ones'', an episode of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'' television show, including the monorail and the flying policeman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/night-gallery/the-different-ones-77173/ |title=Night Gallery, Season 2, Episode 40: The Different Ones |website=tv.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film had a mixed critical reception upon release. ''Time'' magazine called the film a \"weirdly gay little picture that assails with both horror and humor all forms of tyranny over the mind of man\"; it \"strongly supports the widely held suspicion that [[Julie Christie]] cannot actually act. Though she plays two women of diametrically divergent dispositions, they seem in her portrayal to differ only in their hairdos.\" They also noted that the film's \"somewhat remote theme challenged [Truffaut's] technical competence more than his heart; the finished film displays the artisan more than the artist\".<ref name=\"timereview\"/>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] called the film a \"pretentious and pedantic production\" based on \"an idea that called for slashing satire of a sort beyond [Truffaut's] grasp, and with language he couldn't fashion into lively and witty dialogue. The consequence is a dull picture\u2014dully fashioned and dully played\u2014which is rendered all the more sullen by the dazzling color in which it is photographed.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |title=Fahrenheit 451 Makes Burning Issue Dull |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 November 1966 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D02E6D91330E43BBC4D52DFB767838D679EDE |access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref> [[Leslie Halliwell]] described it as \"[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]] stuff, a little lacking on plot and rather tentatively directed, but with charming moments\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Halliwell |first=Leslie |editor=John Walker |title= Halliwell's Film and Video Guide |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |page=246 |isbn=0-00-638779-9}}</ref>\n\nIt has gained significant critical acclaim over the years. On the review aggregator web site ''Rotten Tomatoes'', the film holds an 82% positive rating among top film critics based on 33 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"''Fahrenheit 451'' is an intriguing film that suffuses Truffaut's trademark wit and black humor with the intelligence and morality of Ray Bradbury's novel.\"<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web |title=Fahrenheit 451 |website=Rotten Tomatoes |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007003-fahrenheit_451/ |access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref> [[Martin Scorsese]] has called the film an \"underrated picture\", which had influenced his own films.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/truffaut.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213093425/http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/truffaut.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2006 |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=Scorsese |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Scorsese |date=13 November 2006 |access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Response by Ray Bradbury===\nAuthor Ray Bradbury said in later interviews that, despite its flaws, he was pleased with the film. He was particularly fond of the film's climax, where the Book People walk through a snowy countryside, reciting the poetry and prose they've memorised, set to Bernard Herrmann's melodious score. He found it especially poignant and moving.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, alluding to a possible remake, Bradbury said in a 2009 interview, \"The mistake they made with the first one was to cast Julie Christie as both the revolutionary and the bored wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.laweekly.com/la-people-2009-the-writer-ray-bradbury/ |title=LA People 2009: The Writer \u2014 Ray Bradbury |author=Jill Stewart |date=22 April 2009 |website=LA WEEKLY}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"25%\"| Award ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"20%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1967\n| [[20th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best British Actress]]\n| [[Julie Christie]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Hugo Award]]s<ref name=\"hugo\">{{cite web|title=1967 Hugo Awards |publisher=The Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1967-hugo-awards/ |access-date=18 May 2012}}</ref>\n| [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]]\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Jean-Louis Richard]], [[Helen Grace Scott Keenan|Helen Scott]], [[Ray Bradbury]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 1966\n| [[27th Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]]<ref name=\"imdbawards\"/>\n| [[Golden Lion]]\n| Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Music==\nAccording to an introduction by Ray Bradbury to a CD of a rerecording of the film score by William Stromberg conducting the [[Moscow Symphony Orchestra]], Bradbury had suggested [[Bernard Herrmann]] to Truffaut. Bradbury had visited the set of ''[[Torn Curtain]],'' meeting [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and Herrmann. When Truffaut contacted Bradbury for a conference about his book, Bradbury recommended Herrmann, as Bradbury knew that Truffaut had written a detailed book about Hitchcock.<ref>Bradbury, Ray. ''Bernard Herrmann and Fahrenheit 451''. Liner Notes for CD, 2007.</ref> When Herrmann asked Truffaut why he was chosen over modern composers, such as the director's friends [[Pierre Boulez]] or [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], the director replied that \"They'll give me music of the twentieth century but you'll give me music of the twenty first!\"<ref>Kogehehn, Gunther. ''Fahrenheit 451''. Liner Notes for CD, 2007.</ref> Herrmann used a score of only [[string instrument]]s, [[harp]], [[xylophone]], [[vibraphone]], [[marimba]] and [[glockenspiel]]. As with ''Torn Curtain'', Herrmann refused the studio's request to do a title song.\n\n==Spanish broadcast==\nDespite the totalitarian overtones in the plot, the film was broadcast uncensored on Spanish state television ([[RTVE]]) in the early 1970s at a time when Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] was still in power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Baecque |first1=Antoine de |last2=Toubiana |first2=Serge |title=Truffaut: A Biography |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=978-0375400896 |url=https://archive.org/details/truffaut00baec }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Bergan |editor-first=Ronald |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: Interviews |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Oxford |year=2008 |isbn=978-1934110133 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/franoistruffauti0000truf }}\n* {{cite book|last=Bradbury |first=Ray |title=Fahrenheit 451 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=978-0743247221}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Holmes |editor-first=Diana |editor2-last=Ingram |editor2-first=Robert |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (French Film Directors) |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |year=1998 |isbn=978-0719045530}}\n* {{cite book |last=Insdorf |first=Annette |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0521478083 |url=https://archive.org/details/francoistruffaut0000insd }}\n* {{cite book |last=Insdorf |first=Annette |title=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0521478083 |url=https://archive.org/details/francoistruffaut0000insd }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0060390|title=Fahrenheit 451}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=74448}}\n* {{Amg movie|16576|Fahrenheit 451}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1007003-fahrenheit_451|Fahrenheit 451}}\n\n{{Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut}}\n{{Ray Bradbury}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1960s dystopian films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ray Bradbury]]\n[[Category:British science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:Dystopian films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bernard Herrmann]]\n[[Category:Films about bibliophilia]]\n[[Category:Films about censorship]]\n[[Category:Films about totalitarianism]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:French science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]"}]}}}}
