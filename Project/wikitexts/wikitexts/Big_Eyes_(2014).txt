It is about the relationship between American artist [[Margaret Keane]] and her second husband, [[Walter Keane]], who, in the 1950s and 1960s, took credit for Margaret's phenomenally popular paintings of people with big eyes.\n\nThe film had its world premiere in New York City on December 15, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|title=Harvey Weinstein Praises 'Big Eyes' Screenwriters-Producers at Film's Premiere|url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/news/harvey-weinstein-sony-hacking-praises-screenwriters-at-big-eyes-premiere-1201380858/|website=Variety|date=December 16, 2014}}</ref> and was released in the U.S. by [[The Weinstein Company]] on December 25, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Conference For The Weinstein Company's \"BIG EYES\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/photos/press-conference-weinstein-companys-big-20141212-184849-769.html |website=Yahoo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216033416/http://news.yahoo.com/photos/press-conference-weinstein-companys-big-20141212-184849-769.html |archive-date=December 16, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> It was met with generally favorable reviews, with particular praise given to the performances of Adams and Waltz and performed moderately well at the box office, grossing $29 million worldwide against the budget of $10 million. Adams won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] and received a nomination for the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress in a Leading Role]]. Waltz was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe for his performance]], and [[Lana Del Rey]] received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe nomination]] for the film's title song, \"[[Big Eyes (song)|Big Eyes]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1950s, [[Margaret Keane|Margaret Ulbrich]] leaves her then husband and takes her young daughter Jane to [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], [[San Francisco]], where she gets a job painting illustrations at a furniture factory. While doing portraits at an outdoor art show, she meets [[Walter Keane]], who sells paintings of Parisian street scenes, but makes his money in real estate. Soon they become close friends. Margaret is distraught when her husband asks for custody as part of divorce settlement. Walter proposes, and they marry and honeymoon in [[Hawaii]]. She retains custody of Jane.\n\nUnable to get his or Margaret's paintings into a fine art gallery, Walter convinces the owner of [[hungry i|a popular jazz club]], [[Enrico Banducci]], to rent him some wall space to exhibit their work. He is frustrated when the designated space is in the back by the bathrooms. He fights with Banducci and puts the man's head through one of Margaret's canvases. This becomes a front-page story in a local newspaper, which packs the club with people curious to see the art that made grown men fight. Dick Nolan, a celebrity gossip columnist, wants to know more about the artwork, but proceeds to ask about Margaret's paintings of young girls with big eyes. Walter goes along with the misunderstanding, failing to clarify that they are Margaret's creation. Afterward, he shows Margaret how much money he made selling her work and suggests they team up, with her staying at home painting and him taking credit and handling publicity and sales.\n\nWalter opens his own gallery selling Margaret's art, and eventually hits on the idea of making cheap reproductions of Margaret's works, which sell in huge numbers. The family moves into a mansion. Walter spends his time hobnobbing with celebrities while Margaret is stuck at home, feeling increasingly isolated. He even makes Margaret lie to Jane about who is doing the paintings.\n\nOne day, she finds a crate full of paintings of Parisian street scenes, all signed \"S. CENIC\". She realizes she has never actually seen Walter paint, and discovers he has been painting over the name of the original artist and claiming these paintings as his own. When confronted, he says he always wanted to be an artist, but never had the talent.\n\nDisillusioned, Margaret indicates she is losing her interest in continuing the ruse, so Walter threatens to have her killed. Later, he tells her of his plan to get a painting displayed at the upcoming [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] and demands Margaret paint her \"masterpiece\". Jane sneaks into the studio when Margaret is working on the huge painting, ''Tomorrow Forever'', and says she already knew Margaret was really the artist.\n\nAt a party, Walter becomes angry after reading [[John Canaday]]'s scathing review of ''Tomorrow Forever'', which led to the painting to not be exhibited at the Fair, and confronts the critic. At home, he drunkenly blames Margaret for the failure. He throws lit matches at her and Jane who escape and lock themselves in the studio.  As he proceeds to throw lit matches and nearly set the house on fire, they run away from home.\n\nOne year later, Margaret and Jane have settled in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Walter says he will only give Margaret a divorce if she signs over the rights to every painting and produce 100 more. Initially  Margaret agrees, but her growing interest in the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] convinces her of the importance of honesty. She finally signs a batch of paintings with her own name. Later, on a Hawaiian radio show, she reveals she is the real artist behind the \"big eyes\" paintings, which makes national news. Nolan publishes Walter's claims that Margaret is delusional. On Jane's suggestion,  Margaret sues both Walter and Nolan's newspaper for [[Defamation|slander and libel]].\n\nAt the trial, the judge immediately dismisses the libel suit against the newspaper, and Walter is left to defend himself against slander. He botches his defence, even mimicking in court what he has gathered from watching Perry Mason episodes on TV.  When he proceeds to cross-examine himself as a witness, the judge is fed up and directs both Margaret and Walter to create a painting in court to prove who is the real artist. Whereas Margaret paints steadily, Walter stalls before claiming his arm hurts too much to hold a paintbrush. Margaret wins the lawsuit, and a fan asks her to sign a copy of Walter's coffee table book.\n\nThe film ends with text that states Walter continued to insist he was the true artist until his death, though he never painted again, and that Walter died in poverty. Margaret eventually moved back to San Francisco, where she opened a new gallery, and still paints every day.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- in the order listed in the film's end credits -->\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Margaret Keane]]\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as [[Walter Keane]]\n* [[Danny Huston]] as Dick Nolan\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as Dee-Ann\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Ruben\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as [[John Canaday]]\n* [[Jon Polito]] as [[Enrico Banducci]]\n* Delaney Raye as a Young Jane\n* [[Madeleine Arthur]] as Older Jane\n* [[James Saito]] as Judge\n* [[Dylan Kingwell]] as Boy at Art Show (in the park)\n\n==Production==\nWriters [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] negotiated with [[Margaret Keane]] over her life rights and wrote ''Big Eyes'' as a [[spec script]].
