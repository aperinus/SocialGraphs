Drew's parents, Kenny ([[Joe Morton]]) and Brenda ([[Suzzanne Douglass]]), worry that their son is emotionally disturbed. His favorite companion is a doll, in which he names Iago (after the character in the Shakespeare classic [[Othello]]), with which he engages in animated conversations. They also fear that a fire he accidentally set in the family garage foreshadows a future as an arsonist.\n\nOn Martha's Vineyard, Drew is thrown into an affluent, party-loving [[African-American|black]] society that congregates on a beach known as the ''Inkwell''. The visit is also the occasion of some bitter family strife. Drew's Aunt Frances ([[Vanessa Bell Calloway]]) and her husband, Spencer ([[Glynn Turman]]), are [[Conservatism|conservative]]s whose walls are plastered with pictures of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] dignitaries such as [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who they keep saying will become president someday).  Kenny, a former [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]], and Spencer argue furiously about racial issues.\n\n''The Inkwell'' follows Drew's bumbling pursuit of the insufferably snooty Lauren ([[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]]). He also befriends Heather ([[Adrienne-Joi Johnson]]), a young woman whose husband, Harold ([[Morris Chestnut]]), is a faithless louse. The movie comes to an end on the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], when the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] fireworks end up symbolizing not just [[United States|America's]] 200th birthday but Drew finally having sex with Heather.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Larenz Tate]] as Drew Tate\n*[[Joe Morton]] as Kenny Tate\n*[[Suzzanne Douglass]] as Brenda Tate\n*[[Glynn Turman]] as Spencer Phillips\n*[[Vanessa Bell Calloway]] as Francis Phillips\n*[[Adrienne-Joi Johnson]] as Heather Lee\n*[[Morris Chestnut]] as Harold Lee\n*[[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] as Lauren Kelly\n*[[Duane Martin]] as Junior Phillips\n*[[Mary Alice]] as Evelyn\n*Phyllis Yvonne Stickney as Dr. Wade\n*[[Markus Redmond]] as Darryl\n*Perry Moore as Moe\n*Akia Victor as Charlene\n*[[Jade (American band)|Jade]] as The New York Dream Machine\n\n==Production==\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, the cast reunited with writer/filmmaker Lathleen Ade-Brown for ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]''<ref>[http://www.essence.com/2014/04/25/exclusive-cast-inkwell-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary EXCLUSIVE: The Cast of 'The Inkwell' Celebrates Its 20th Anniversary], ''Essence'', April 25, 2014</ref> where Larenz Tate spoke about the casting process. He told the magazine \"Matty Rich was holding auditions in LA. Jada [Pinkett Smith] was already cast in the role [as Lauren] and I remember her calling me, saying, \u2018You got to do this movie!\u2019 In fact, she was saying, \u2018Listen, let\u2019s meet up and rehearse because they are going to want me to read with you, so let\u2019s rehearse, so you totally land it!\u2019 I told her, \u2018I\u2019m going to rip that role! No need to rehearse, you just keep up with me and we just play off each other.\u2019 She says. \u2018I got you, let\u2019s do it!\u2019 I go in the audition and we really just lit up the room, then I had to audition solo. They didn't know what to expect considering I just did Menace II Society playing O-Dawg, a completely street person. So that impressed them and they offered me the part.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''The Inkwell'' was poorly received by critics.
