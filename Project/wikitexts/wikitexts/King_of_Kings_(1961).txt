Adapted from the [[New Testament]], the film tells the story of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] from his birth and ministry to his [[crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. It stars [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, with [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]], [[Robert Ryan]], [[Viveca Lindfors]], [[Ron Randell]], [[Hurd Hatfield]], and [[Rip Torn]].\n\nThroughout the 1950s, [[John Farrow]] began developing a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus, tentatively titled ''Son of Man''. In November 1958, actual development started when Farrow partnered with Samuel Bronston following their collaboration on ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]'' (1959). By the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]] to write a new script. Filming commenced in April 1960, and wrapped in October 1960.\n\nFinancing of the film was initially provided by [[du Pont family|Pierre S. du Pont III]], but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was interested in the film following its success with ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots took place in December 1960 and again in May 1961.\n\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in New York City on October 11, 1961. It premiered in Los Angeles on October 12 and opened there on October 13. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]] was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 63 BC, [[Pompey]] conquered [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|city was sacked]]. He entered [[Temple in Jerusalem|the Temple]] to seize the treasure of [[Solomon]] and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the [[Torah]]. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns.\n\nMany years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans [[Crucifixion|crucify]] many of the leaders and place [[Herod the Great]] on [[Judea]]'s throne.\n\nA carpenter named [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and his wife [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who is about to give birth, arrive in [[Bethlehem]] for the [[census]]. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed [[Biblical Magi|the Magi]] from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child-king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children.\n\nMary and Joseph flee to [[Egypt]] with the child. The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son [[Herod Antipas]], who then takes power. In [[Nazareth]], Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who knows now that Jesus escaped the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the infants]]. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end.\n\nYears pass and Jewish rebels led by [[Barabbas]] and [[Judas Iscariot]] prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next [[List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers#The Administration of Judaea .28AD 6.E2.80.93135.29|governor of Judea]], [[Pontius Pilate]] and his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia]]. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives.\n\nPilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the [[River Jordan]], where [[John the Baptist]] preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is [[baptism|baptized]] by John, who recognizes that he is the [[Messiah]]. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is [[temptations of Christ|tempted]] by [[Satan]]. After forty days, Jesus travels to [[Galilee]], where he recruits his [[Apostles in the New Testament|Apostle]]s.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] leaves the rebel [[Barabbas]] and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, [[Salome]], who despises him.\n\nHerod, Pilate and the High Priest [[Caiaphas]] are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during [[Passover]], during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the [[Antonia Fortress]], but the [[Roman legion|legions]] of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels,  leaving Barabbas as the sole survivor who ends up getting arrested.\n\nJesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having [[Last Supper|supper]] one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at [[Gethsemane]]. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free [[Judea]] from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before [[Caiaphas]] and then brought before Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back.\n\nPilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of [[Barabbas]], and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Jesus, wearing a [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]] on his head, carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the [[penitent thief]] [[Dismas]] and the other, the [[Impenitent thief]], [[Gestas]].\n\nDesperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle [[John the Apostle|John]], a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \"He is truly the Christ\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, [[Mary Magdalene]] finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus.\n\nThe film ends on the shores of [[Lake Tiberias]] when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \"a final time\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to [[Heaven]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Ron Randell]] as [[Lucius of Cyrene]]\n* [[Viveca Lindfors]] as [[Claudia Procula]]\n* [[Rita Gam]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Carmen Sevilla]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Brigid Bazlen]] as [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as [[Barabbas]]\n* [[Rip Torn]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Royal Dano]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n* [[Robert Ryan]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Edric Connor]] as [[Balthazar (magus)|Balthazar]]\n* [[Maurice Marsac]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[George Coulouris]] as a camel driver\n* [[Conrado San Mart\u00edn]] as [[Pompey]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* Antonio Mayans as [[John the Apostle]] (credited as Jos\u00e9 Antonio)\n* [[Luis Prendes]] as [[Dismas]], the [[Penitent thief]]\n* [[David Davies (Welsh actor)|David Davies]] as burly man\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Nieto (actor)|Jos\u00e9 Nieto]] as [[Caspar (magus)|Caspar]]\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Rojo]] as [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]]\n* [[Fernando Sancho]] as [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|the demon-possessed man]]\n* [[Michael Wager]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* [[F\u00e9lix de Pom\u00e9s]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Adriano Rimoldi]] as [[Melchior (magus)|Melchior]]\n* Barry Keegan as [[Gestas]], the [[Impenitent thief]]\n* [[Rafael Luis Calvo]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* Tino Barrero as [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]]\n* Paco Mor\u00e1n as [[blind man of Bethsaida]] (credited as Francisco Moran)\n'''Uncredited Cast'''\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as a man at the [[Sermon on the Mount]]{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n* [[Ray Milland]] as the voice of [[Satan]]{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n* [[Orson Welles]] as the [[Narrator]]{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn February 1951, it was reported that director [[John Farrow]] was developing a biographical film on the life of Jesus, with his script being titled ''Son of Man''.
