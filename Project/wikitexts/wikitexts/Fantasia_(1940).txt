The third [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]], seven of which are performed by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Music critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]] acts as the film's [[Master of Ceremonies]] who introduces each segment in live action.\n\nDisney settled on the film's concept in 1938 as work neared completion on ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', originally an elaborate ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon designed as a comeback role for [[Mickey Mouse]], who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with [[Fantasound]], a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and [[RCA]] that made ''Fantasia'' the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to [[surround sound]].\n\n''Fantasia'' was first released as a [[roadshow theatrical release|theatrical roadshow]] that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941; the first began at the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]] in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to [[World War II]]'s cutting off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been [[Reissue|reissued]] multiple times by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and [[Buena Vista Distribution]] with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, ''Fantasia'' is the 23rd [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.]]\n\nThe [[Fantasia (franchise)|''Fantasia'' franchise]] has grown to include video games, [[Disneyland]] attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', co-produced by Walt's nephew [[Roy E. Disney]], was released in 1999. ''Fantasia'' has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest animated films of all time]]; in 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] and the fifth greatest animated film in their [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]] list. In 1990, ''Fantasia'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Program ==\n[[File:Fantasia theatrical trailer.png|thumb|right|Title screen in the original theatrical trailer]]\n''Fantasia'' opens with live action scenes of members of an orchestra gathering against a blue background and tuning their instruments in half-light, half-shadow. Master of ceremonies [[Deems Taylor]] enters the stage (also in half-light, half-shadow) and introduces the program.\n\n* [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Live-action shots of the orchestra illuminated in blue and gold, backed by [[superimposed]] shadows, fade into [[abstract art|abstract]] patterns. Animated lines, shapes and cloud formations reflect the sound and rhythms of the music.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=35}}\n* ''[[The Nutcracker|The Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. Selections from the 1892 ballet suite underscore scenes depicting the changing of the seasons from summer to autumn to winter. A variety of dances are presented with fairies, fish, flowers, mushrooms, and leaves, including \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", \"Chinese Dance\", \"Arabian Dance\", \"Russian Dance\", \"Dance of the Flutes\"  and \"Waltz of the Flowers\".{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=45}}\n* ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' by [[Paul Dukas]].

After the intermission there is a brief [[jam session]] of jazz music led by a clarinettist as the orchestra members return. Then a humorously stylized demonstration of how sound is rendered on film is shown. An animated sound track \"character\", initially a straight white line, changes into different shapes and colors based on the sounds played.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|pp=128\u2013132}}\n* ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|The Pastoral Symphony]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. A mythical Greco-Roman world of colorful centaurs and \"[[Centaurides|centaurettes]]\", cupids, fauns and other figures from [[classical mythology]] is portrayed to Beethoven's music. A gathering for a festival to honor [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], the god of wine, is interrupted by [[Zeus]], who creates a storm and directs [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] to forge lightning bolts for him to throw at the attendees.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=133}}\n* ''[[Dance of the Hours]]'' by [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]. A comic ballet in four sections: Madame Upanova and her ostriches (Morning); Hyacinth Hippo and her servants (Afternoon); Elephanchine and her bubble-blowing elephant troupe (Evening); and Ben Ali Gator and his troop of alligators (Night). The finale finds all of the characters dancing together until their palace collapses.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=161}}\n* ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]] and ''[[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ave Maria]]'' by [[Franz Schubert]]. At midnight the devil [[Chernabog]] awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain.

A chorus is heard singing ''Ave Maria'' as a line of robed monks is depicted walking with lighted torches through a forest and into the ruins of a cathedral.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=181}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n====''The Sorcerer's Apprentice''====\n[[File:Leopold Stokowski LOC 26447u.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Leopold Stokowski]] conducted the film's score.]]\nIn 1936, [[Walt Disney]] felt that the Disney studio's star character [[Mickey Mouse]] needed a boost in popularity. He decided to feature the mouse in ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'', a deluxe cartoon short based on [[Der Zauberlehrling|the 1797 poem]] written by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and set to the 1897 [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|orchestral piece]] by [[Paul Dukas]] inspired by the original tale.<ref name=la1990>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-26-tv-552-story.html|first=Charles|last=Solomon|title=Fantastic 'Fantasia' - Disney Channel Takes a Look at Walt's Great Experiment in Animation|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1990|access-date=January 17, 2011}}</ref> The concept of matching animation to classical music was used as early as 1928 in Disney's cartoon series, the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'', but he wanted to go beyond the usual slapstick, and produce shorts where \"sheer fantasy unfolds&nbsp;... action controlled by a musical pattern has great charm in the realm of unreality.\"{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=13}}{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=242}} Upon receiving the rights to use the music by the end of July 1937,{{sfn|Culhane|1983|pp=80\u201384}} Disney considered using a well-known conductor to record the music for added prestige. He happened to meet [[Leopold Stokowski]], conductor of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] since 1912, at [[Chasen's]] restaurant in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], and talked about his plans for the short. Stokowski recalled that he did \"like the music\"; was happy to collaborate on the project, and offered to conduct the piece at no cost.<ref name=millimeter>{{Cite magazine|last=Smith|first=David R.|date=February 1976|title=The Sorcerer's Apprentice: Birthplace of Fantasia|magazine=Millimeter Magazine|pages=18\u201320, 22, 24, 64\u201367}}</ref>\n\nFollowing their meeting, Disney's New York representative ran into Stokowski on a train headed for the East Coast. In writing to Disney, he reported that Stokowski was \"really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing. He had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium\".<ref name=millimeter/> In his excited response dated October 26, 1937, Disney wrote that he felt \"all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us&nbsp;... The union of Stokowski and his music, together with the best of our medium, would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation.\" He had already begun working on a story outline, and wished to use \"the finest men&nbsp;... from color&nbsp;... down to animators\"<ref name=fammuseumfant /> on the short. ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was to be promoted as a \"special\" and rented to theatres as a unique film, outside of the [[Mickey Mouse film series|Mickey Mouse cartoon series]].<ref name=millimeter/>{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=243}}\n\nAn agreement signed by Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937, allowed the conductor to \"select and employ a complete symphony orchestra\" for the recording.<ref name=orchvsdisney93 /> Stokowski was paid $5,000 for his work.{{sfn|Mosley|1985|p=176}} Disney hired a stage at the [[Culver Studios]] in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n====Expansion to feature film====\nAs production costs of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own.<ref name=la1990 /> Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, \"because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature&nbsp;... we have no idea what can be expected from such a production.\"<ref name=millimeter/> [[Ben Sharpsteen]], a production supervisor on ''Fantasia'', noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual ''Silly Symphony'', but Disney \"saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers\u2014regardless of their running time\u2014put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert\u2014something novel and of high quality.\"{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=18}}\n\nIdeas to produce a complete feature film were pursued in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=18}} In August, Disney asked Stokowski's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film, which was initially titled ''The Concert Feature''.<ref name=millimeter/> Disney agreed to pay Stokowski $80,000 plus royalties for his services.{{sfn|Mosley|1985|p=176}} The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic [[Deems Taylor]] provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the [[New York Philharmonic]], and agreed he would be most suitable for the role.{{sfn|Pegolotti|2003|p=235}} Disney did contact Taylor about the project, but by then work on ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', and development on his new [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Burbank studio]] kept him too busy to work on the new feature.{{sfn|Pegolotti|2003|p=233}} In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, leave to come to the studios as soon as possible. He left New York City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a month's visit.{{sfn|Pegolotti|2003|p=235}}\n\n==== Story meetings and program selection ====\n[[File:Deems Taylor (1885-1966).jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Deems Taylor]] was the film's [[Master of Ceremonies]], who introduced each segment in live-action interstitial scenes.]]\nTaylor arrived at the studio one day after a series of meetings began to select the musical pieces for ''The Concert Feature''. Disney made story writers [[Joe Grant]] and [[Dick Huemer]] gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=18}} Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering.{{sfn|Pegolotti|2003|p=236}} Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained.{{sfn|Allan|2000|p=96}} In one meeting, he inquired about a piece \"on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme&nbsp;... with animals\".{{sfn|Pegolotti|2003|p=237}} The group was considering ''[[The Firebird]]'' by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his \"''Le Sacre du printemps'' would be something on that order\", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, \"This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings.\"<ref name=culhanenytimes1990>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/books/l-disney-stravinsky-and-the-sock-232890.html |title=Disney, Stravinsky and 'The Sock' |work=The New York Times |first=John |last=Culhane |date=January 14, 1990 |access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nNumerous choices were discarded as talks continued, including ''Moto Perpetuo'' by [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] with \"shots of dynamos, cogs, pistons\" and \"whirling wheels\" to show the production of a collar button. Other deleted material included ''[[Prelude in G minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in G minor]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Tchaikovsky)|Troika]]'' by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and a rendition of \"The Song of the Flea\" by Mussorgsky, which was to be sung by [[Lawrence Tibbett]].{{sfn|Allan|2000|p=97}} On September 29, 1938, around sixty of Disney's artists gathered for a two-and-a-half hour piano concert while he provided a running commentary about the new musical feature. A rough version of ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was also shown that, according to one attendee, had the crowd applauding and cheering \"until their hands were red\".{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=308}} The final pieces were chosen the following morning, which included Toccata and Fugue in D minor, ''[[Cydalise et le Ch\u00e8vre-pied]]'' by [[Gabriel Piern\u00e9]], ''The Nutcracker Suite'', ''Night on Bald Mountain'', ''Ave Maria'', ''Dance of the Hours'', ''[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de Lune]]'' by [[Claude Debussy]], ''The Rite of Spring'' and ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice''.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=308}} Disney had already begun working out the details for the segments, and showed greater enthusiasm and eagerness as opposed to his anxiety while starting on ''Pinocchio''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=247}}\n\n''Clair de Lune'' was soon removed from the ''Fantasia'' program, but Disney and his writers encountered problems of setting a concrete story to ''Cydalise''. Its opening march, \"The Entry of the Little Fauns\", attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted. On January 5, 1939, following a search for a stronger piece to fit the mythological theme, the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven's sixth symphony.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=252\u2013253}} Stokowski disagreed with the switch, believing that Disney's \"idea of mythology&nbsp;... is not quite what this symphony is about\". He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer's intent.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=317\u2013318}} Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change, describing it as \"a stunning one\", and saw \"no possible objection to it\".{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=134}}\n\nThe new feature continued to be known as ''The Concert Feature'' or ''Musical Feature'' as late as November 1938. Hal Horne, a publicist for Disney's film distributor [[RKO Radio Pictures]], wished for a different title, and gave the suggestion ''Filmharmonic Concert''. [[Stuart Buchanan]] then held a contest at the studio for a title that produced almost 1,800 suggestions including ''Bach to Stravinsky and Bach'' and ''Highbrowski by Stokowski''. Still, the favorite among the film's supervisors was ''Fantasia'', an early working title that had even grown on Horne, \"It isn't the word alone but the meaning we read into it.\"{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=316}} From the beginning of its development, Disney expressed the greater importance of music in ''Fantasia'' compared to his past work: \"In our ordinary stuff, our music is always under action, but on this&nbsp;... we're supposed to be picturing this music\u2014not the music fitting our story.\"{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=248}} Disney had hoped that the film would bring classical music to people who, like himself, had previously \"walked out on this kind of stuff\".<ref name=latimesmagic1990>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-10-07-ca-3186-story.html |title=It Wasn't Always Magic |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Charles |last=Solomon |date=October 7, 1990 |access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Segments ===\nOver 1,000 artists and technicians were used in the making of ''Fantasia'',<ref name=vhs1991>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ya0fAAAAIBAJ&pg=1148%2C8087297 |title='Fantasia' marks anniversary with video |work=The Southeast Missourian |access-date=January 16, 2011 |date=October 29, 1991 |first=David |last=Hente |via=Google News Archive}}</ref> which features more than 500 animated characters.<ref name=mont1943>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z30tAAAAIBAJ&pg=5791%2C1440462 |title='Fantasia' returning in complete version |work=The Montreal Gazette |date=May 8, 1943 |access-date=February 12, 2011 |via=Google News Archive}}</ref> Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between preceding and following ones.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=150}} Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=150}} The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional [[Maquette|clay models]] so the animators could view their subject from all angles.{{sfn|Culhane|1983|p=22}} The live action scenes were filmed using the [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|three-strip Technicolor]] process, while the animated segments were shot in successive [[CMYK color model|yellow, cyan and magenta]]-exposed frames.

With one containing the picture film with a mono soundtrack for backup purposes, the other ran a sound film that was mixed from the nine tracks recorded at the Academy to four: three of which contained the audio for the left, center, and right stage speakers respectively, while the fourth became a control track with amplitude and frequency tones that drove [[variable-gain amplifier]]s to control the volume of the three audio tracks.{{sfn|Telotte|2008|pp=38\u201340}} In addition were three \"house\" speakers placed on the left, right, and center of the auditorium that derived from the left and right stage channels which acted as [[surround channels]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2003|pp=3\u20136}} As the original recording was captured at almost peak modulation to increase [[signal-to-noise ratio]], the control track was used to restore the dynamics to where Stokowski thought they should be. For this, a tone-operated gain-adjusting device was built to control the levels of each of the three audio tracks through the amplifiers.{{sfn|Shepherd|2003|pp=3\u20136}}\n\nThe illusion of sound traveling across the speakers was achieved with a device named the \"[[panning (audio)|pan pot]]\", which directed the predetermined movement of each audio channel with the control track. Mixing of the soundtrack required six people to operate the various pan pots in real time, while Stokowski directed each level and pan change which was marked on his musical score.

Many found fault with Stokowski's rearrangements and abridgements of the music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski's arrangement of ''The Rite of Spring'',  \"the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated\", and criticized the orchestra's performance, observing that the simplification of the score \"did not save the musical performance, which was execrable\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Don|title=The Rite of Spring programme notes|url=http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/Discover-the-music/Programme-Notes/The-Rite-of-Spring.aspx?ID=2673&pID=2522&YearMonth=2015,06|publisher=Toronto Symphony Orchestra|access-date=May 10, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=James|title=Who Owns the Rights to the 'Rite'?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/nyregion/who-owns-the-rights-to-rite.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 22, 1993 |access-date=May 10, 2015}}</ref> Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity.

One review of the film in this manner, written by [[Dorothy Thompson]] for ''The New York Herald Tribune'' on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she \"left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown\", because the film was a \"remarkable nightmare\". Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as \"the abuse of power\" and \"the perverted betrayal of the best instincts\". Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being \"titanic\" while man was only \"a moving lichen on the stone of time\". She concluded that the film was \"cruel\", \"brutal and brutalizing\", and a negative \"caricature of the Decline of the West\". In fact, Thompson claimed that she was so distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, ''Night on Bald Mountain'' and ''Ave Maria'', because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's \"brutalization\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Minority Report|first=Dorothy|last=Thompson|date=November 25, 1940|newspaper=The New York Herald Tribune}}</ref>\n\n==== Later reviews ====\n{{Rotten Tomatoes data|prose|consensus=A landmark in animation (and a huge influence on the medium of music video), Disney's ''Fantasia'' is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images.|ref=yes}} {{Metacritic film prose |score=96 |count=18 |ref=yes |access-date=May 21, 2022}} ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film four stars, calling it \"the most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios\", noting how the film \"integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/fantasia/review/2030346787/|title=Fantasia|magazine=TV Guide|access-date=February 28, 2014|archive-date=December 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213183851/https://www.tvguide.com/movies/fantasia/review/2030346787/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film four stars out of four, and noted that throughout ''Fantasia'', \"Disney pushes the edges of the envelope\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fantasia-1990 |title=Fantasia |work=Chicago Sun-Times |first=Roger |last=Ebert |access-date=February 28, 2011 |date=October 5, 1990 |via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> However, ''Empire'' magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 (poor), concluding \"this is a very patchy affair - while some of the animated pieces work, others come across as downright insane\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=967|title=Fantasia|magazine=Empire|access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Remarks have also been made about ''Fantasia'' not being a children's film.
