It was adapted from [[Christopher Koch]]'s 1978 novel ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (novel)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. The story is about a love affair set in [[Indonesia]] during the [[Transition to the New Order|overthrow]] of President [[Sukarno]]. It follows a group of foreign correspondents in [[Jakarta]] on the eve of an attempted coup by the [[30 September Movement]] in 1965.\n\nThe film stars [[Mel Gibson]] as Australian journalist Guy Hamilton, and [[Sigourney Weaver]] as British Embassy officer Jill Bryant. It also stars [[Linda Hunt]] as a Chinese-Australian man with dwarfism, Billy Kwan, Hamilton's local photographer contact, a role for which Hunt won the 1983 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].<ref name= \"Worrell\">{{cite magazine | last1 = Worrell | first1 = Denise | first2= Gerald | last2=Clarke | title = The Night off the Great Prom | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 23 April 1984 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921697,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101029145951/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921697,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 October 2010 | access-date =24 May 2010 }}</ref> The film was shot in both [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]] and includes Australian actors [[Bill Kerr]] as Colonel Henderson and [[Noel Ferrier]] as Wally O'Sullivan.\n\nIt was banned from being shown in Indonesia until 2000, after the [[Fall of Suharto|forced resignation]] of coup-leader and political successor [[Suharto]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-nov-11-mn-50398-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Year%20of%20Living%20Dangerously,the%20Jakarta%20International%20Film%20Festival.&text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Year%20of%20Living%20Dangerously%E2%80%9D%20was%20the%20name,Sukarno%20himself%20gave%20to%201965. |title='Year' at Last Gets Its Day in Indonesia |date=11 November 2000|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |last1= Paddock |first1=Richard C. }}</ref> The title ''The Year of Living Dangerously'' is a quote which refers to a famous [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase used by Sukarno; ''[[Vivere pericoloso|vivere pericolosamente]]'', meaning \"living dangerously\". Sukarno used the line for the title of his [[Independence Day (Indonesia)|Indonesian Independence Day]] [[:s:id:Tahun \"Vivere Pericoloso\"|speech of 1964]].\n\n==Plot==\nGuy Hamilton, a neophyte [[foreign correspondent]] for an [[Australia]]n TV network, arrives in [[Jakarta]] on assignment. He meets the close-knit members of the foreign correspondent community, including journalists from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States|US]], and [[New Zealand]], diplomatic personnel\u2014and Billy Kwan, a [[Chinese-Australian]] man with dwarfism of high intelligence and moral seriousness. Hamilton is initially unsuccessful because his predecessor, tired of life in [[Indonesia]], had departed without introducing Hamilton to his contacts. He receives limited sympathy from the journalist community, which competes for scraps of information from [[Sukarno]]'s regime, the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), and the conservative Muslim-dominated [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]]. However, Billy takes a liking to Guy and arranges interviews for him with key political figures.\n\nBilly introduces Guy to Jill Bryant, a beautiful young assistant at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Jakarta|British embassy]]. Billy and Jill are close friends, yet Billy subtly manipulates her encounters with Guy. After resisting Guy because she's returning to the UK, Jill falls in love with him. Discovering that the [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese]] are arming the PKI, Jill passes this information to Guy to save his life, but he wants to cover the Communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Shocked, Billy and Jill cut off contact with Guy, and he is left with the American journalist, Pete Curtis, and his own assistant and driver Kumar, who is secretly a member of the PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Guy, and tries to open his eyes to all that is going on.\n\nBilly, outraged by Sukarno's failure to meet the needs of most Indonesians, decides to hang a sign saying \"Sukarno feed your people\" from the [[Hotel Indonesia]] expressing his outrage, but is thrown from the window by security men, and dies in Guy's arms. His death is also witnessed by Jill. Still in search of \"the big story\", Guy visits the [[Merdeka Palace|Presidential palace]] after the army generals have taken over and [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966|unleashed executions]], after they learned of the Communist shipment. Struck down by an Army officer, Guy suffers a [[Retinal detachment|detached retina]]. Resting alone in Billy's bungalow, Guy recalls a passage from the [[Bhagavad Gita]], \"all is clouded by desire\", which Billy told him. Kumar visits him and tells him about the failed coup attempt. Risking permanent damage to his eye, a bandaged Guy implores Kumar to drive him to the airport, where he boards the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Jill.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Guy Hamilton\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Jill Bryant\n* [[Bill Kerr]] as Colonel Henderson\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Pete Curtis\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Billy Kwan\n* [[Noel Ferrier]] as Wally O'Sullivan\n* [[Bembol Roco]] as Kumar\n* [[Paul Sonkkila]] as Kevin Condon\n* Ali Nur as Ali\n* Mike Emperio as [[Sukarno]]\n* Domingo Landicho as Hartono\n* [[Kuh Ledesma]] as Tiger Lily\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA number of filmmakers were interested in buying the rights to [[Christopher Koch]]'s novel including [[Phillip Noyce]]. It was [[Peter Weir]] who was successful. Koch wrote an early draft but Weir was unhappy with it. [[Alan Sharp]] wrote three more drafts, then [[David Williamson]] was brought on to do several more drafts. Koch later came back on to work on some of the voice over, although he never spoke with Peter Weir. Koch later claimed that the final script was \"55% Williamson/Weir, and 45% Koch\".<ref name=\"koch\">Christopher Koch, \"Screenplay by...\", ''Cinema Papers'', March 1983 p10</ref>\n\nThe film was originally backed by the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and the [[Australian Film Commission]], with international distribution arranged by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA Entertainment Company]]. However, the SAFC then dropped out and Weir's agent suggested MGM provide the entire $6 million budget themselves, which is what happened.<ref name=\"stratton2\"/><ref>{{cite news | title = Mel Gibson Has All Ingredients For Superstardom | author = Bob Thomas | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | date = 15 February 1983}}</ref> It was by far the most ambitious Australian film undertaken at the time and was one of the first co-productions between Australia and a Hollywood studio.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Linda hunt billy kwan year of living dangerously.png|thumb|Linda Hunt as Billy Kwan]]\nDancer [[David Atkins]] was originally cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir began to feel that the relationship between his character and [[Mel Gibson]]'s was not working so he decided to recast.

Weir said, \"All slums look alike, after all.\"<ref>Brad Newsham, Take Me with You: A Round-the-world Journey to Invite a Stranger Home, Traveler's Tales, 2000.</ref> Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. The crew moved to Sydney in early April 1982 during its fifth week of the six-week Philippine shoot with only a few small scenes remaining. Filming in Australia was for another six weeks.<ref name=\"Hollie\"/>\n\nGibson downplayed the death threats, saying, \"It wasn't really that bad.
