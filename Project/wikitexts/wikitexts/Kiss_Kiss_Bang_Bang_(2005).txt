The script is partially based on the [[Brett Halliday]] novel ''Bodies Are Where You Find Them'' (1941), and interprets the classic [[hardboiled]] literary genre in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] fashion. The film was produced by [[Joel Silver]], with [[Susan Downey|Susan Levin]] and Steve Richards as executive producers.\n\nShot in [[Los Angeles]] between February 24 and May 3, 2004, the film debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 14, 2005,<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4254587/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang|access-date=December 12, 2009|work=Festival Cannes}}</ref> and was released in the United States on October 21, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $15 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Lockhart unintentionally wins a [[screen test]] in New York City by showing remorse in an audition for a botched burglary he committed, which casting director Dabney Shaw mistakes for [[method acting]]. He is sent to Los Angeles for a screen test.\n\nAt a party there, Harry meets his childhood crush Harmony Lane and \"Gay\" Perry van Shrike, a private investigator hired to give him on-the-job tutelage for his screen test. Party host Harlan Dexter, a retired actor, has recently resolved a feud over his wife's inheritance with his estranged daughter, Veronica.\n\nDuring a stakeout at a [[Big Bear Lake]] cabin, Perry and Harry see a car being dumped in the lake. Noticing a female body in the trunk, Perry shoots the lock in a rescue attempt, but accidentally hits the corpse. They decide against reporting it as it will appear he killed her. Believing Harry is a private investigator, Harmony tells him of her sister, Jenna, who supposedly killed herself; he finds the lake corpse, identified as Veronica, in his bathroom and dumps it with Perry, but soon discovers Jenna used Harmony's credit card to hire Perry. Harry goes to see Harmony, who accidentally cuts off his finger when she slams the door, after finding out he lied about being a private investigator.\n\nAt a party where Harmony is working, Mr. Frying Pan and Mr. Fire, the two men from the lake, beat Harry to cease his investigation. Harmony and Harry follow them to Perry's latest stakeout: she goes to warn Perry, leaving Harry sleeping in the car, ending in Mr. Frying Pan being killed by an armed food-cart operator. A pink-haired girl, affiliated with Mr. Frying Pan and Mr. Fire, steals Harmony's car and unwittingly drives an unconscious Harry to her home. Mr. Fire arrives and kills her, then Harry kills him.\n\nHarry meets Harmony at his hotel where she reveals she told Jenna that Harlan was her real father, to diminish the pain of their [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusive]] father. She also reveals she slept with Harry's best friend in high school, so he throws her out.\n\nHearing of Harmony's supposed disappearance, Harry and Perry investigate a mental hospital owned by Harlan. They discover Veronica was locked in there by him, to be replaced by Pink Hair Girl, to end the inheritance feud. Harry unintentionally kills a murderous orderly, and then they are captured by Harlan. Harry contacts Harmony, who steals the van with Veronica's corpse. The men escape, and are shot by the same bullet; Harry then manages to kill Harlan.\n\nIn hospital, the trio learn Jenna committed suicide after witnessing Harlan having  sex with Veronica's replacement, believing her \"new father\" was also [[incest]]uous. Perry slaps Jenna's father, who is bed-ridden, as Harry secures a job working for Perry.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per opening tombstone credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll (same order) --->\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Harold \"Harry\" Lockhart\n** Indio Falconer Downey as Harry age 9\n** Richard Alan Brown as Teen Harry (uncredited)\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as \"Gay\" Perry van Shrike\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Harmony Faith Lane\n** [[Ariel Winter]] as Harmony age 7\n** Stephanie Pearson as Teen Harmony\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Harlan Dexter\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Mr. Frying Pan\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Dabney Shaw\n* [[Rockmond Dunbar]] as Mr. Fire\n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as Mia Frye (Pink Hair Girl)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kiss Kiss Bang Bang script|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Kiss_Kiss_Bang_Bang.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Angela Lindvall]] as Flicka\n* [[Daniel Browning Smith]] as Rubber Boy\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Bear in Genaros Beer Commercial (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the bad critical reception of ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' and a rejection letter from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], Shane Black decided he would attempt something out of the action genre.<ref name=thr/> Following the example of [[James L.
