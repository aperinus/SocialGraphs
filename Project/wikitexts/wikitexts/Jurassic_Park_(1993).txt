Molen]]. It is the first installment in the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' franchise,&nbsp;and the first film in the&nbsp;''Jurassic Park''&nbsp;original trilogy, and is based on the [[Jurassic Park (novel)|1990 novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]] and a screenplay written by Crichton and [[David Koepp]]. The film is set on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off [[Central America]]'s Pacific Coast near [[Costa Rica]]. There, wealthy businessman John Hammond and a team of genetic scientists have created a [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] of [[De-extinction|de-extinct]] [[dinosaur]]s. When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and security precautions, a small group of visitors and Hammond's grandchildren struggle to survive and escape the perilous island.\n\nBefore Crichton's novel was published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. With the backing of [[Universal Studios]], Spielberg acquired the rights for $1.5&nbsp;million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired for an additional $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii from August to November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed ''[[Schindler's List]]''. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking [[computer-generated imagery]] by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) and with life-sized [[animatronic]] dinosaurs built by [[Stan Winston]]'s team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]], a company specializing in digital [[surround sound]] formats. The film was backed by an extensive $65&nbsp;million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals with over 100 companies.\n\n''Jurassic Park'' premiered on June 9, 1993, at the [[Uptown Theater (Washington, D.C.)|Uptown Theater]] in Washington, D.C., and was released on June 11 in the United States.

The film won more than twenty awards, including three [[Academy Awards]] for its technical achievements in visual effects and sound design. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film was followed by five sequels \u2013 ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997), ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' (2001), ''[[Jurassic World]]'' (2015), ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]'' (2018), and ''[[Jurassic World Dominion]]'' (2022).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\n[[Industrialist]] John Hammond has created a [[Animal theme park|theme park]] of cloned [[dinosaurs]], Jurassic Park, on tropical Isla Nublar. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a ''[[Velociraptor]]'', the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand a safety certification. Gennaro invites [[mathematician]] [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], while Hammond invites [[paleontologist]] [[Alan Grant (character)|Alan Grant]] and [[paleobotanist]] [[Ellie Sattler]]. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''.\n\nAt the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting [[Ancient DNA|dinosaur DNA]] from prehistoric [[mosquito]]es preserved in [[amber]]. DNA from [[frog]]s and other animals was used to fill in gaps in the [[genome]] of the dinosaurs, and to prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female by direct chromosome manipulation. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby ''Velociraptor'' and visits the raptor enclosure. During lunch, the group debates the [[ethics of cloning]] and the creation of the park; Malcolm warns about the implications of [[genetic engineering]] and scoffs at the park's conceptualization, saying that it will inevitably break down.\n\nHammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, join for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees from the control room. The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick ''[[Triceratops]]''; it is cut short as a [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] approaches. Most of the park employees leave for the mainland on a boat while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Sattler, who stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the ''Triceratops''.\n\nJurassic Park's disgruntled lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur [[embryo]]s. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and stores the embryos inside a container disguised as a shaving cream can. Nedry's sabotage also cuts power to the tour vehicles, stranding them just as they near the park's ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' paddock. Most of the park's electric fences are also deactivated, allowing the ''[[Rexy|Tyrannosaurus]]'' to escape and attack the group. After the ''Tyrannosaurus'' overturns a tour vehicle, it injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro, while Grant, Lex and Tim escape. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his [[Jeep Wrangler]], and is killed by a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''.\n\nSattler helps the game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors; they only find an injured Malcolm, just before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' returns and chases them away. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop and encounter a ''Brachiosaurus''. They later discover the broken shells of dinosaur eggs, and Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA\u2014some [[common reed frog|West African frogs]] can [[Dichogamy|change their sex]] in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well.\n\nUnable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the ''Velociraptors''. Muldoon distracts the raptors while Sattler goes to turn the power back on before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Meanwhile, Muldoon is caught off-guard and killed by the other two raptors.\n\nGrant, Tim and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in a kitchen, but they escape and join Grant and Sattler, who have returned. The group reaches the control room and Lex uses Nedry's computer to restore the park's power, allowing them to call Hammond, who calls for help. As they try to escape by the front entrance, they are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the ''Tyrannosaurus'' appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the group boards a helicopter to leave the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Dr. Alan Grant]]\n* [[Laura Dern]] as [[Ellie Sattler|Dr. Ellie Sattler]]\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Dr. Ian Malcolm]]\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as [[Dr. John Hammond]]\n* [[Bob Peck]] as [[Robert Muldoon (fictional character)|Robert Muldoon]]\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] as [[Donald Gennaro]]\n* [[BD Wong|B.D.

[[Warner Bros.]] and [[Tim Burton]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]] bid for the rights,{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416\u20139}} but [[Universal Studios]] eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.<ref name=\"Production notes\">DVD Production Notes</ref> After completing ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', Spielberg wanted to film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.

Upon reflection, he felt life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not at all convincing. Instead Spielberg sought the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. He brought in [[Stan Winston]] to create the [[animatronics|animatronic]] dinosaurs; [[Phil Tippett]] (credited as Dinosaur Supervisor) to create [[go motion]] dinosaurs for [[long shot]]s; [[Michael Lantieri]] to supervise the on-set effects; and [[Dennis Muren]] of [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to do the [[digital compositing]]. Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] supervised the designs,<ref>{{cite web |last=Epstein |first=Sonia |title=Science on Screen: Interview with Jack Horner, Jurassic World |url=http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/2718/science-on-screen-interview-with-jack-horner-jurassic-world |date=June 14, 2016 |website=Sloan Science & Film |access-date=June 14, 2016 |archive-date=July 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717105236/http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/2718/science-on-screen-interview-with-jack-horner-jurassic-world |url-status=live}}</ref> to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. Certain concepts about dinosaurs, like the theory they [[Origin of birds|evolved into birds]] and had very little in common with lizards, were followed. This prompted the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early [[animatics]],<ref name=\"Earl doc\">{{cite video |title=The Making of Jurassic Park |author=[[James Earl Jones|Jones, James Earl]] (Host) |medium=VHS |publisher=Universal |year=1995}}</ref> as Horner complained it was implausible.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite news |author=French, Lawrence |work=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=24 |number=2 |page=9 |title=Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Movements}}</ref> Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding [[latex]] skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of the raptors in the kitchen and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attacking the car. Despite go motion's attempts at [[motion blur]]s, Spielberg found the end results unsatisfactory for a [[live-action]] feature film. Muren told Spielberg he thought the dinosaurs could be built using [[computer-generated imagery]]; the director asked him to prove it.<ref name=\"Earl doc\" /> ILM animators [[Mark A.Z.
