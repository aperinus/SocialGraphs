Williams]]) is a young woman that was drugged and raped by Pierce (Ryan Cooper) and three friends, who then left her for dead. She manages to make her way home, where the viewer discovers that Julia has spent most of her life being abused by various tormentors and has turned to [[self-harm]] as a result. Later Julia overhears someone discussing a therapy that has rape victims taking back power from their attackers. She's introduced to  Dr. Sgundud ([[Jack Noseworthy]]) through the mysterious Sadie ([[Tahyna Tozzi]]). Under her guidance, Julia seduces a man (implied to be a rapist of one of the past patients of Sgrundud) and lures him to her apartment. Stripping [[naked]], she seduces him and engages in [[sexual intercourse]], but halfway through the rest of the sisterhood restrain him, make Julia castrate him (taking genitals as a trophy), impale him numerous times and dispose of the body.\n\nAfter several more hunts, Julia one day sees one of her rapists, Adam, in the clinic where she works, and decides to seek revenge on them all using Sgrundud's methods. She convinces Adam to assemble a meeting (claiming that \"in a way, it [what happened] was the best thing to ever happen to me\") but leaving Pierce, the rapists \"boss\", as last. The night of the meeting, Julia drugs Adam and the other two friends who raped her, surgically removes Adam's eyes (as he did not actually rape her, only watched) and the other men's genitalia, then leaves for the last one, Pierce. However, she finds him killed and evirated by the sisterhood, while Julia herself is knocked unconscious and taken back to Dr. Sgrundud after Sadie snitches on her.\n\nSgrundud tells Julia that she has violated the rules of \"taking medicine\" and therefore, drugged again, is about to be vivisected. He also reveals that the idea of emasculating victims came to him after he himself went through such a procedure performed by his father after he discovered his son's homosexuality, as he liked to dress in his sister's clothes. However, before he starts to operate on Julia, Sadie saves her, entering the building, and kills Sgrundud's associates. The doctor confronts Sadie and points his gun at her, but Julia manages to get off the operating table and decapitates Sgrundud from behind. Before Sadie can thank her friend, Julia shoots her in the head and leaves towards an unknown future.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ashley C.
