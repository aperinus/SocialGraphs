During her absence, Solwal management realises her colleagues are able to cover her shifts by working slightly longer hours and proposes a \u20ac1,000 bonus to each if they agree to make Sandra redundant. On Friday evening, after Sandra hears the news and that only two of the 16 voted for her to stay, she breaks down, feeling hopeless and worthless.\n\nHer husband, Manu, tries to lift her spirits. A co-worker friend Juliette, who voted on her behalf, convinces her to talk to M. Dumont, the Solwal manager. Sandra is too petrified to speak, but Juliette argues her case. Juliette tells him some of the workers felt pressured to vote against Sandra by the factory foreman Jean-Marc, who insinuated one job must be eliminated. Though hesitant, Dumont agrees to a second, secret ballot early Monday.\n\nRealising that her fate rests in the hands of her co-workers, Sandra must visit each of the 14 over the course of the weekend to persuade them to reject the monetary bonus, and she faces an uphill battle to keep her job before the crucial vote on Monday. Most of her co-workers are counting on the bonus for their own families. Some of her co-workers are immigrants and some are already working second jobs to get by; most react with sympathy, but a few with anger. Sandra is crushed when a co-worker she considered a friend pretends not to be home, but is heartened by the few who support her and say they will vote for her. Timur, an immigrant from [[Dagestan]], breaks down in tears and says he is ashamed of himself, as Sandra covered for him when he broke a panel on his first day. He says he will change his mind and talk to another worker on her behalf.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Sandra discovers that Jean-Marc has been calling their co-workers to convince them not to change their votes, and that in reality he is against Sandra coming back because of her depression. She visits her co-worker Anne, whose husband rudely throws her out and screams at both women. Dejected, Sandra attempts suicide at home by overdosing on [[Xanax]], but when Anne arrives to tell her she will vote for her, Sandra confesses to Manu, who forces her to vomit the pills up. Sandra recovers at the hospital and is touched when she finds out Anne came to the hospital too. Sandra tells Manu they will visit the remaining three that evening. When Anne tells her she has decided to leave her husband, Sandra invites her to their house to spend the night.\n\nSandra speaks to Alphonse, a young African immigrant who is working as a welder on contract. He will only get \u20ac150 because he is new, but he is afraid of Jean-Marc, who told him to vote against Sandra if he wants to get along with his co-workers. Alphonse tells her he wants to vote for her, but he's afraid Jean-Marc will find out and write him up for his mistakes, which could damage his chance of renewing his contract when it expires in September.\n\nOn Monday morning, as the Solwal workers vote again, Jean-Marc reacts angrily to Sandra. She stands up for herself and reminds him that he acted unfairly. In the second ballot, eight vote for her to keep the job, and eight vote to keep the bonus \u2013 not enough to overturn Friday's vote. She tearfully thanks those who voted for her, including Alphonse. She tells Anne she can stay at their house again that night and stoically clears out her locker.\n\nHowever, Dumont calls her into his office and congratulates her on convincing so many to support her. He tells her he has decided to give everyone the bonus but still keep her on. Sandra's joy is short lived as he explains he will simply not renew a worker whose contract expires in September \u2013 Alphonse. Sandra politely declines his offer \u2013 she now has the confidence to start anew, and pursue a new life for herself. \"We put up a good fight,\" she tells Manu proudly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Sandra Bya, working-class wife and mother of two children\n* [[Fabrizio Rongione]] as Manu Bya, Sandra's husband who works as a chef\n* [[Catherine Sal\u00e9e]] as Juliette, Sandra's friend and co-worker\n* [[Olivier Gourmet]] as Jean-Marc, Sandra's supervisor at Solwal\n* [[Christelle Cornil]] as Anne, Sandra's co-worker\n* Timur Magomedgadzhiev as Timur, Sandra's co-worker\n* [[Myriem Akheddiou]]\u00a0as Mireille\n* Pili Groyne as Estelle, daughter of Sandra and Manu \n* Simon Caudry \tas Maxime, son of Sandra and Manu\n* Batiste Sornin as M.
