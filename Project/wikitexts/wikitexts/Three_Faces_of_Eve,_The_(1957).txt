''The Three Faces of Eve'' also became the first film since 1936&mdash;when [[Bette Davis]] won for ''[[Dangerous (1935 film)|Dangerous]]'' (1935)&mdash;to win the Best Actress award without getting nominated in another category.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026261/awards|title=Dangerous|via=www.IMDb.com|access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, Eve White is a timid, self-effacing wife and mother who has severe and blinding headaches and occasional blackouts. Eve eventually goes to see psychiatrist Dr. Luther, and while having a conversation, a \"new personality\", the wild, fun-loving Eve Black, emerges. Eve Black knows everything about Eve White, but Eve White is unaware of Eve Black.\n\nEve White is sent to a hospital for observation after Eve Black is found strangling Eve White's daughter, Bonnie. When Eve White is released, her husband Ralph finds a job in another state and leaves her in a boarding house, while Bonnie stays with Eve's parents. When Ralph returns, he tells her that he doesn't believe she has multiple personalities and tries to take her to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], with him but she feels she isn't well enough to leave, and, afraid Eve Black will try to harm Bonnie again, refuses to go. Eve Black confronts Ralph at his motel, where he realizes Eve Black is real, but allows her to convince him to take her to Jacksonville. When Eve Black goes out dancing with another man, Ralph slaps her when she returns and ends up divorcing Eve White.\n\nDr. Luther considers both Eve White and Eve Black to be incomplete and inadequate personalities. The film depicts Dr. Luther's attempts to understand and deal with these two faces of Eve. Under hypnosis at one session, a third personality emerges, the relatively stable Jane. Dr. Luther eventually prompts her to remember a traumatic event in Eve's childhood. Her grandmother had died when she was six, and according to family custom, relatives were supposed to kiss the dead person at the viewing, making it easier for them to let go. While Eve screams, her mother forces her to kiss the corpse. Apparently, Eve's terror led to the creation of different personalities.\n\nAfter discovering the trauma, Jane remembers her entire past. When Dr. Luther asks to speak with Eve White and Eve Black, Jane says they are gone. Jane marries a man named Earl whom she met when she was Jane and reunites with her daughter Bonnie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joanne Woodward]] as Eve White / Eve Black / Jane\n** [[Mimi Gibson]] as Eve - Age 8\n* [[David Wayne]] as Ralph White\n* [[Lee J.

In her 1958 book ''The Final Face of Eve'', she used the pseudonym Evelyn Lancaster. In her 1977 book ''I'm Eve'', she revealed her true identity. She also wrote a follow-up book, ''A Mind of My Own'' (1989).\n\n==Reception==\nCritics uniformly praised Joanne Woodward's performance, but opinions of other aspects of the film were more mixed. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Woodward played her part \"with superlative flexibility and emotional power\", but that \"when you come right down to it, this is simply a [[melodrama]]tic exercise\u2014an exhibition of psychiatric hocus-pocus, without any indication of how or why. It makes for a fairly fetching mystery, although it is too verbose and too long.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=September 27, 1957 |title=Screen: '3 Faces of Eve' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=16 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film was \"frequently an intriguing and provocative motion picture\" and that Woodward \"fulfills her assignment excellently\", but believed that the comedy elements \"will undoubtedly confuse many viewers who won't quite be sure what emotions are suitable\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 21, 1957 |title=The Three Faces of Eve |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called the film \"a fascinating adult drama\" and said that Woodward's performance was \"of Academy Award caliber\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 24, 1957 |title='The Three Faces of Eve' with Joanne Woodward, Lee J.
