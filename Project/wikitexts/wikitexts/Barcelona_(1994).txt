The three films are independent of each other except for the cameo appearances of some common characters.\n\n==Plot==\nThe main character in ''Barcelona'' is a [[Chicago]] salesman named Ted Boynton, who lives and works in the eponymous Spanish city in 1987. Ted's cousin, Fred, a [[United States Navy|naval]] officer, unexpectedly comes to stay with Ted at the beginning of the film. Fred has been sent to Barcelona to handle public relations on behalf of a U.S. fleet scheduled to arrive later.\n\nThe cousins have a history of conflict since childhood, to which the film refers several times. Ted and Fred develop relationships with various single women in Barcelona and experience the negative reactions of some of the community's residents to the context of Fred's presence. Ted also faces possible problems with his American employer and with the concept of attraction to physical beauty.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Taylor Nichols]] as Ted Boynton\n* [[Chris Eigeman]] as Fred Boynton\n* [[Tushka Bergen]] as Montserrat Raventos\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Marta Ferrer\n* Pep Munn\u00e9 as Ramon\n* Hellena Schmied as Greta\n* Nuria Badia as Aurora Boval\n* [[Jack Gilpin]] as The Consul\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as Dickie Taylor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Barcelona'' received an 83% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 35 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Barcelona (1994)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1055365-barcelona|language=en|access-date=2021-07-06}}</ref>\n\n===Year-end lists===\n*5th&nbsp;\u2013 Bob Strauss, ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''<ref name=Strauss>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Bob|date=December 30, 1994|title=At the Movies: Quantity Over Quality|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|page=L6|edition=Valley}}</ref>\n*7th&nbsp;\u2013 Yardena Arar, ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''<ref name=Strauss/>\n*8th&nbsp;\u2013 Todd Anthony, ''[[Miami New Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Anthony|first=Todd|date=January 5, 1995|title=Hits & Disses|newspaper=[[Miami New Times]]}}</ref>\n*Top 9 (not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Dan Webster, ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Webster|first=Dan|date=January 1, 1995|title=In Year of Disappointments, Some Movies Still Delivered|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|edition=Spokane|page=2}}</ref>\n*Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Steve Murray, ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''<ref name = \"AtlantaYE\">{{cite news|title=The Year's Best|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=December 25, 1994|page=K/1}}</ref>\n*Top 10 (not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Betsy Pickle, ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Pickle|first=Betsy|date=December 30, 1994|title=Searching for the Top 10...
