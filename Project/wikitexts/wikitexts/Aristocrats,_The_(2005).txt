The film was conceived and produced by comedians [[Penn Jillette]], [[Paul Provenza]] and Peter Adam Golden, and it was edited by [[Emery Emery]]. Distributed by [[THINKFilm]], it is dedicated to [[Johnny Carson]], as \"The Aristocrats\" was said to be his favorite joke.<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/aristocrats/synopsis.html HBO The Aristocrats Synopsis]</ref>\n\n==The joke==\n{{Main|The Aristocrats (joke)}}\n\"The Aristocrats\" is a longstanding [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] joke amongst comedians, in which the setup and punchline are almost always the same (or similar).  It is the joke's midsection \u2013 which may be as long as the one telling it prefers and is often completely improvised \u2013 that makes or breaks a particular rendition.\n\nThe joke involves a person pitching an act to a talent agent. Typically the first line is, \"A man walks into a talent agent's office.\" The man then describes the act. From this point, up to (but not including) the [[Punch line|punchline]], the teller of the joke is expected to [[ad-lib]] the most [[Shock value|shocking]] act they can possibly imagine. This often involves elements of [[incest]], [[group sex]], [[graphic violence]], [[defecation]], [[coprophilia]], [[necrophilia]], [[bestiality]], [[rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], and various other [[taboo]] behaviors.\n\nThe joke, as first delivered in the film, contains the set-up line \"What the heck do you call an act like that?\" followed by the punchline \"I call it 'The Aristocrats'.\" In subsequent renditions of the joke, the agent asks, \"What do you call your act?\", which is the traditional set-up line.\n\nThe film itself consists of interviews with various comedians and actors, usually in candid settings. The interviewees engage both in telling their own versions of the joke, and in reminiscing about their experiences with it, the joke's place in comedy history, and even dissecting the logic behind the joke's appeal. A key aspect of the Aristocrats joke is that it was never told to audiences as part of the comedian's stand-up routine. Instead, it was an [[inside joke]] among comedians themselves, who used it as a tool to challenge each other as to who could tell the funniest and most outrageous rendition.\n\nWhile most of the filmed versions of the joke follow the standard format of a raunchy description followed by the punchline of \"the Aristocrats\", some versions do vary the joke.  Two tellings of it, including that of comedian [[Wendy Liebman]], invert the joke by describing an elegant and beautiful performance act which has been given a lewd and transgressive name. Actor [[Taylor Negron]] told his joke as a mixture of salacious sex acts and calmly delivered observations on life. Actor [[Steven Banks]], as Billy the Mime, performs the joke on the street as a mime performance. Most infamously, [[Sarah Silverman]]'s rendition, where she tells the joke in an anecdotal manner from the perspective of the daughter in the family, went on to garner controversy for its punchline involving radio and TV personality [[Joe Franklin]].\n\n==Featured celebrities==\nThe following celebrities are featured in the film, telling the joke themselves and/or providing substantial commentary on its history:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Chris Albrecht]]\n* [[Jason Alexander]]\n* [[Hank Azaria]]\n* [[Shelley Berman]]\n* [[Steven Banks|Billy the Mime]]\n* [[Lewis Black]]\n* [[David Brenner]]\n* [[Jimmy Buffett]]\n* [[Mario Cantone]]\n* [[Drew Carey]]\n* [[George Carlin]]\n* [[Margaret Cho]]\n* [[Mark Cohen (comedian)|Mark Cohen]]\n* [[Carrot Top]]\n* [[Billy Connolly]]\n* [[Tim Conway]]\n* [[Pat Cooper]]\n* [[Wayne Cotter]]\n* [[Andy Dick]]\n* [[Phyllis Diller]]\n* [[Susie Essman]]\n* [[Carrie Fisher]]\n* [[Joe Franklin]]\n* [[Todd Glass]]\n* [[Judy Gold]]\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]]\n* [[Eddie Gorodetsky]]\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]]\n* [[Dana Gould]]\n* [[Allan Havey]]\n* [[Eric Idle]]\n* [[Dom Irrera]]\n* [[Eddie Izzard]]\n* [[Richard Jeni]]\n* [[Jake Johannsen]]\n* [[The Amazing Johnathan]]\n* [[Alan Kirschenbaum]]\n* [[Jay Kogen]]\n* [[Paul Krassner]]\n* [[Cathy Ladman]]\n* [[Lisa Lampanelli]]\n* [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]]\n* [[Wendy Liebman]]\n* [[Bill Maher]]\n* [[Howie Mandel]]\n* [[Merrill Markoe]]\n* [[Jay Marshall (magician)|Jay Marshall]]\n* [[Jackie Martling]]\n* [[Chuck McCann]]\n* [[Michael McKean]]\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]]\n* [[Martin Mull]]\n* [[Kevin Nealon]]\n* [[Taylor Negron]]\n* ''[[The Onion]]'' editorial staff\n* [[Otto and George]]\n* [[Rick Overton]]\n* [[Gary Owens]]\n* [[The Passing Zone]]\n* [[Penn & Teller]]\n* [[Emo Philips]]\n* [[Kevin Pollak]]\n* [[Paul Reiser]] \n* [[Andy Richter]]\n* [[Don Rickles]]\n* [[Chris Rock]]\n* [[Gregg Rogell]]\n* [[Jeffrey Ross]]\n* [[Rita Rudner]]\n* [[Bob Saget]]\n* [[T.

According to a letter from Penn Jillette to critic [[Roger Ebert]], [[Buddy Hackett]] and [[Rodney Dangerfield]] were intended to be included, but they died before they could be filmed. Jillette also indicated that, this being [[Johnny Carson]]'s favorite joke, Carson was also invited to appear, but he declined.<ref>{{cite web | author=Penn Jillette | title=Letter to Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050821/ANSWERMAN/508210304/1023 | date=21 August 2005 | work=Movie Answer Man | publisher=RogerEbert.com | access-date=29 October 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033407/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050821%2FANSWERMAN%2F508210304%2F1023 | archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] animated a segment of the film where [[Eric Cartman]] tells a version of the joke.\n\n==Joe Franklin controversy==\nIn the film, [[Sarah Silverman]] tells a version of the joke as if it were autobiographical and she had been one of the \"Aristocrats\" performers as a child.  Silverman builds the story to include her family being booked on veteran talk show host [[Joe Franklin]]'s show, and ends with her [[punch line]]: a [[deadpan]] allegation that Franklin had raped her during a phony rehearsal for the show. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that Silverman's telling of the joke led Franklin, who is also featured in the film, to consider filing a defamation lawsuit against the comedian.<ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Goodyear | title=Quiet Depravity | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/24/051024fa_fact | work=The New Yorker | date=24 October 2005| access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the April 20, 2011, episode of the WFMU show ''[[Seven Second Delay]]'', Franklin jokes that he had been so successful lately because he sued Silverman.<ref>{{cite interview | title=Andy co-hosts with Joe Franklin at the UCB Theater  | url=http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/40025 | type=Interview: audio/transcript | work=Seven Second Delay with Ken and Andy | publisher=WFMU | date=20 April 2011 | access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==AMC banning==\nThe theatre chain [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] refused to show the movie on any of its 3,500+ screens.

Taped not long after the [[September 11 attacks]], the incident occurred at a time when, according to one of the commentators in the ''Aristocrats'' film, entertainers were uncertain how much comedy was allowed in the aftermath of the attacks. Gottfried followed [[Rob Schneider]], who had received mixed results with his stand-up comedy performance in Hefner's honor. Gottfried began his performance with a joke in which he claimed to have to catch a late flight out of town but was worried because his flight \"had a connection at the [[Empire State Building]].\"  The joke, a reference to 9/11, was poorly received by the audience, who showered Gottfried with boos and cries of \"too soon.\"  In response, Gottfried told an obscenity-filled rendition of the Aristocrats joke. According to the film, the telling was as much a cathartic experience for the audience as it was a shocking one, regardless of whether viewers were familiar with the joke or not. During his performance, Gottfried told the audience \"They might have to clean this up for TV.\"\n\n==Reception==\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! Year \n!
