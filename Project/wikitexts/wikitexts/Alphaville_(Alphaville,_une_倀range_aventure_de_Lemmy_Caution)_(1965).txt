It stars [[Eddie Constantine]], [[Anna Karina]], [[Howard Vernon]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. The film won the [[Golden Bear]] award of the [[15th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1965.<ref name=\"berlinale 1965\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1965/03_preistr_ger_1965/03_Preistraeger_1965.html |title=Berlinale 1965: Prize Winners |access-date=20 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| first=Colin | last=MacCabe | year=2005\n| title=Godard: A Portrait of the Artist at Seventy | page=347 | publisher=Macmillan\n| isbn=0-571-21105-4\n}}</ref>\n\n''Alphaville'' combines the [[genre]]s of [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction]] and [[film noir]]. There are no special [[Theatrical property|props]] or futuristic sets; instead, the film was shot in real locations in [[Paris]], the night-time streets of the capital becoming the streets of Alphaville, while modernist glass and concrete buildings (that in 1965 were new and strange architectural designs) represent the city's interiors. The film is set in the future but the characters also refer to twentieth-century events; for example, the hero describes himself as a [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal veteran]].\n\nExpatriate American actor [[Eddie Constantine]] plays [[Lemmy Caution]], a [[trenchcoat]]-wearing secret agent. Constantine had already played this or similar roles in dozens of previous films; the character was originally created by British [[crime]] novelist [[Peter Cheyney]]. However, in ''Alphaville'', director Jean-Luc Godard moves Caution away from his usual twentieth-century setting and places him in a futuristic sci-fi dystopia, the [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] [[dictatorship]] of Alphaville.\n\n==Plot==\nLemmy Caution is a [[secret agent]] with the code number of 003 from \"the Outlands\". Entering Alphaville in his [[Ford Galaxie]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Ghost: Films and Their Medium |first=Gilberto |last=P\u00e9rez |page=358 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8018-6523-7}}</ref> he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson and claims to work for the ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro]]-[[Pravda]]''. Caution is on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson ([[Akim Tamiroff]]); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun ([[Howard Vernon]]); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun, which is in complete control of all of Alphaville.\n\nAlpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like [[love]], [[poetry]], and [[emotion]] in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because{{'-}}\". People who show signs of emotion are presumed to be acting illogically and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of [[George Orwell]]'s concept of [[Newspeak]], there is a [[dictionary]] in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society.\n\nImages of the [[mass-energy equivalence|''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup>]] and [[Planck\u2013Einstein relation|''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''hf'']] (the iconic [[equation]]s of, respectively, [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], the two great scientific developments of the first half of the 20th century) are displayed several times to refer to the [[scientism]] that underpins Alphaville. At one point, Caution passes through a place called the Grand Omega Minus, from where brainwashed people are sent out to the other \"galaxies\" to start [[Strike action|strike]]s, [[revolution]]s, family rows, and student revolts.\n\nAs an archetypal American [[anti-hero|antihero]] private eye in trenchcoat and with weathered visage, Lemmy Caution's old-fashioned machismo conflicts with the puritanical computer (Godard originally wanted to title the film ''[[Tarzan]] versus [[IBM]]'').<ref name=\"Darke_1\">{{harvp|Darke|2005|p=10}}</ref> The opposition of his role to logic (and that of other dissidents to the regime) is represented by faux quotations from ''[[Capitale de la douleur]]'' (\"Capital of Pain\"), a book of poems by [[Paul \u00c9luard]].\n\nCaution meets Dickson, who soon dies in the process of making love to a \"Seductress Third Class\". Caution then enlists the assistance of Natacha von Braun ([[Anna Karina]]), a programmer of Alpha 60 and daughter of Professor von Braun. Natacha is a citizen of Alphaville and, when questioned, says that she does not know the meaning of \"love\" or \"conscience\". Caution falls in love with her, and his love introduces emotion and unpredictability into the city. Natacha discovers, with the help of Lemmy Caution, that she was actually born outside of Alphaville. (The city name is given as Nueva York\u2014[[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[New York City|New York]]\u2014instead of either the original English name or the French literal rendering \"Nouvelle-York\".)\n\nProfessor von Braun (the name is a reference to the German rocket scientist [[Wernher von Braun]]<ref name=\"Darke_2\">{{harvp|Darke|2005|p=76}}</ref>) was originally known as Leonard Nosferatu (a tribute to [[F. W. Murnau]]'s film ''[[Nosferatu]]''), but Caution is repeatedly told that Nosferatu no longer exists. The Professor himself talks infrequently, referring only vaguely to his hatred for journalists, and offering Caution the chance to join Alphaville, even going so far as to offer him the opportunity to rule a galaxy. When he refuses Caution's offer to go back to \"the outlands\", Caution kills him.\n\nAlpha 60 converses with Lemmy Caution several times, and its voice is seemingly ever-present in the city, serving as a sort of narrator. Caution eventually destroys or incapacitates it by telling it a riddle that involves something that Alpha 60 can not comprehend: poetry (although many of Alpha 60's lines are actually quotations from the Argentine poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and the film's opening line, along with others, is an extract from Borges's essay \"Forms of a Legend\", and Alpha 60 makes other references to Borges's \"[[A New Refutation of Time]]\"). The concept of the individual self has been lost to the collectivized citizens of Alphaville, and this is the key to Caution's riddle.\n\nAt the end, Natacha realizes that it is her understanding of herself as an individual with desires that saves her and destroys Alpha 60. The film ends with her line \"Je vous aime\" (\"I love you\").\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Eddie Constantine]] as [[Lemmy Caution]]\n* [[Anna Karina]] as Natacha von Braun\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as Henri Dickson\n* [[Christa Lang]] as 1st Seductress Third Class\n* Val\u00e9rie Boisgel as 2nd Seductress Third Class\n* [[Jean-Louis Comolli]] as Professor Jeckell\n* Michel Delahaye as Prof. von Braun's assistant\n* Jean-Andr\u00e9 Fieschi as Professor Heckell\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as the Breakfast-waiter\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (actor)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3]] as the Chief-engineer\n* [[Howard Vernon]] as Professor von Braun/Leonard Nosferatu\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{box quote|width=30em|bgcolor=cornsilk|fontsize=100%|salign=center|quote=\u201cProfessor von Braun (Howard Vernon) has invented the omniscient computer that rules the lives of the Alphaville citizens...The dominating computer, reducing life to \u2018logic\u2019...replaces the  individual\u2019s will with a tranquilized submission...In Alphaville, by computer decree, killing is a spectator sport.

Buildings used were the Electricity Board building for the Alpha 60 computer centre and the Hotel Scribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/the-future-is-now-sci-fi-films-in-real-locations-49304078/ |title=The future is now: Sci-fi films in real locations |first=Rich |last=Trenholm |date=19 November 2009 |website=[[CNET]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415162652/http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/the-future-is-now-sci-fi-films-in-real-locations-49304078/ |archive-date=15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nConstantine came to the film through producer Andr\u00e9 Michelin, who had the actor under contract. Constantine had become a popular actor in France and Germany through his portrayal of tough-guy detective Lemmy Caution in a series of earlier films. Godard appropriated the character for ''Alphaville'' but according to director Anne Andreu,<ref name=alphadvd>\"Alphaville, p\u00e9riph\u00e9ries\" (\"The Outskirts of Alphaville\"), special feature, ''Alphaville'' DVD release, Studio Canal/Universal, 2007</ref> Godard's subversion of the Lemmy Caution \"stereotype\" effectively shattered Constantine's connection with the character\u2014he reportedly said that he was shunned by producers after ''Alphaville'' was released. Constantine didn't play Lemmy Caution again until ''[[Panic Time]]'' in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176061/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1#actor|title = Eddie Constantine|website = [[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nThe opening section of the film includes an unedited sequence that depicts Caution walking into his hotel, checking in, riding an elevator and being taken through various corridors to his room. According to cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]], he and Godard shot this section as a continuous four-minute take. Part of this sequence shows Caution riding an elevator up to his room, which was achieved thanks to the fact that the hotel used as the location had two glass-walled elevators side by side, allowing the camera operator to ride in one lift while filming Constantine riding the other car through the glass between the two. However, as Coutard recalled, this required multiple takes, since the elevators were old and in practice they proved very difficult to synchronize.<ref name=alphadvd />\n\nLike most of Godard's films, the performances and dialogue in ''Alphaville'' were substantially improvised. Assistant director [[Charles Bitsch]] recalled that, even when production commenced he had no idea what Godard was planning to do. Godard's first act was to ask Bitsch to write a screenplay, saying that producer Michelin had been pestering him for a script because he needed it to help him raise finance from backers in Germany (where Constantine was popular). Bitsch protested that he had never read a Lemmy Caution book, but Godard simply said \"Read one and then write it.\" Bitsch read a Caution book, then wrote a 30-page treatment and brought it to Godard, who said \"OK, fine\" and took it without even looking at it. It was then given to Michelin, who was pleased with the result, and the \"script\" was duly translated into German and sent off to the backers. In fact, none of it even reached the screen and according to Bitsch the German backers later asked Michelin to repay the money when they saw the completed film.<ref name=alphadvd />\n\n==Influences on the film==\n*[[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]] is directly referenced by Caution in the taxi, when he says \"I am on a journey to the end of the night\" (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932). Also, the use of poetry to combat Alpha 60 as a sentient being echoes the attitudes of C\u00e9line in a number of his works.\n*[[Henri Bergson]] is also referenced by Caution when being interrogated by Alpha 60, when he answers \"the immediate data of consciousness \" (Essai sur les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience, 1889) when asked his religion. Bergson's rejection of idealism in favour of felt experiences parallels Caution's conflict with the logical Alpha 60.\n*Another reference to French poetry is made by Caution when speaking to Alpha 60, saying that when it will solve his riddle it will become \"[his] like, [his] brother,\" echoing the famous last line of [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''To the Reader'' in [[Les Fleurs du mal|Flowers of Evil]].\n*[[Jean Cocteau]] exerted significant influence on Godard's films,<ref name=\"Godard_1\">{{harvp|Godard|1986|p=277}}</ref> and parallels between ''Alphaville'' and Cocteau's 1950 film ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]'' are evident. For example, Orph\u00e9e's search for C\u00e9geste and Caution's for Henri Dickson, between the poems Orph\u00e9e hears on the radio and the aphoristic questions given by Alpha 60, between Orph\u00e9e's victory over death through the recovery of his poetic powers and Caution's use of poetry to destroy Alpha 60.<ref name=\"Godard_1\"/> Godard also openly acknowledges his debt to Cocteau on several occasions.<ref name=\"Godard_2\">{{harvp|Godard|1986|p=278}}</ref> When Alpha 60 is destroyed, for instance, people stagger down labyrinthine corridors and cling to the walls like the inhabitants of Cocteau's ''Zone de la mort'', and, at the end of the film, Caution tells Natacha not to look back. Godard compares this scene with Orph\u00e9e's warning to [[Eurydice]], and it is also possible to detect a reference here to the [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot flees Sodom|biblical flight from Sodom]].<ref name=\"Godard_2\"/>\n*The voice of Alpha 60 was performed by a man with a [[mechanical larynx|mechanical voice box]] replacing his [[cancer of the larynx|cancer-damaged]] [[larynx]].<ref name=\"Darke_3\">{{harvp|Darke|2005|p=39}}</ref> It is inspired by [[Dr. Mabuse]]'s disembodied voice in the 1933 film ''[[The Testament of Dr Mabuse]]''.<ref name=\"Darke_4\">{{harvp|Darke|2005|p=101}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{cleanup rewrite|section=yes|date=October 2020}}\n* Episode 21 of season 1 of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', \"[[The Return of the Archons]]\", which originally aired on 9 February 1967, refers to ''Alphaville''.\n*German [[synthpop]] band [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] took their name from the film.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alphaville {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/alphaville-mn0000790509/biography|access-date=2020-10-27|publisher=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref>\n*The affluent suburb [[Alphaville, S\u00e3o Paulo|Alphaville]], outside of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], is named after the film.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Mike |title=Planet of Slums |date=2006 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=1-84467-022-8 |page=117}}</ref>\n*The cover of [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s 1974 debut album ''[[Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley]]'' was inspired by ''Alphaville''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmyYHC55kjo|title = - YouTube|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n* ''Alphaville'' is mentioned in the first chapter of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.\n* The music video for the 1993 song \"[[Linger (The Cranberries song)|Linger]]\" by [[The Cranberries]] was shot in [[grayscale]] and is a tribute/recreation of scenes from ''Alphaville''.\n*The film production company [[AlphaVille Pictures Copenhagen|Alphaville Pictures]] was co-founded in 2003 by [[Denmark|Danish]] director [[Christoffer Boe]], and was named after the film.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/directorinterviews/2007/05/christoffer-boe-allegro.html |first=Nick |last=Dawson |title=Christoffer Boe, ''Allegro'' |journal=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker Magazine]] |date=9 May 2007 |access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Haruki Murakami]]'s 2004 novel ''[[After Dark (Murakami novel)|After Dark]]'' features a [[love hotel]] named after the film.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n*The music video for the 2005 [[Kelly Osbourne]] song \"[[One Word]]\" is an homage to ''Alphaville''.
