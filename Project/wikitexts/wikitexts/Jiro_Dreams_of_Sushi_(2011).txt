Sukiyabashi Jiro is a 10-seat, sushi-only restaurant located in a [[Tokyo]] subway station.  As of 2014, Jiro Ono serves a [[tasting menu]] of roughly 20 courses, for a minimum of [[Japanese yen|JP\u00a5]]30,000 (US$270).<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/is-sukiyabashi-jiro-actually-worth-it-2014-4 Is Sukiyabashi Jiro really worth it?] businessinsider.com</ref>\n\nThe film also profiles Jiro's two sons, both of whom are also sushi chefs. The younger son, {{nihongo4|Takashi|\u9686\u58eb}}, left Sukiyabashi Jiro to open a mirror image of his father's restaurant in [[Roppongi Hills]]. The 50-year-old elder son, {{nihongo4|[[Yoshikazu Ono|Yoshikazu]]|\u798e\u4e00}}, obliged to succeed his father, still works for Jiro and is faced with the prospect of one day taking over the [[flagship]] restaurant.\n\n==Production and release==\nInitially, Gelb had planned to do what he had nicknamed  \"Planet Sushi\", inspired by the [[cinematography]] of the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'':<ref name=\"indiewire\" />\n\n<blockquote>Originally, I was going to make a film with a lot of different sushi chefs who all had different styles, but when I got to Jiro's restaurant, I was not only amazed by how good the sushi was and how much greater it was than any other sushi restaurant I had ever been to, but I also found Jiro to be such a compelling character and such an interesting person. I was also fascinated by the story of his son, who is fifty years old, but still works for his father at the restaurant. So, I thought, \"Here's a story about a person living in his father's shadow while his father is in a relentless pursuit of perfection.\" It was the makings of a good feature film.</blockquote>\n\nFood critic Masuhiro Yamamoto connected Gelb with Jiro.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/david-gelb-dreams-sushi-jiro-qa|title=David Gelb Dreams of Sushi: A Jiro Q&A &#124; Blog &#124; Independent Lens &#124; PBS}}</ref>  [[Principal photography]] took Gelb one month (January 2010), augmented by additional scenes shot later that year in August; editing took 10 months.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web| publisher= [[Indiewire]] | url= https://www.indiewire.com/article/interview-jiro-dreams-of-sushi-director-david-gelb | title= ''Jiro Dreams of Sushi'' \u2014 Director David Gelb on Capturing One of Japan's National Treasures | first=Austin |last=Dale | date= March 8, 2012 | accessdate= 2013-01-16}}</ref>\n\n''Jiro Dreams of Sushi'' debuted in the US in 2011 at the [[Provincetown International Film Festival]]<ref name=\"ptownfilmfest.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ptownfilmfest.org/films/schedule_detail.php?id=33 |archiveurl= http://www.ptownfilmfest.org/film_archive/2011/schedule_detail.php?id=33| title=Jiro Dreams of Sushi | archivedate= 2011 | publisher= [[Provincetown International Film Festival]]| accessdate= 2013-01-16}}</ref> and was an official selection of the Tribeca Film Festival<ref name=\"tribecafilm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/jiro_dreams_of_sushi-film36081.html |title=Tribeca Film Guide: Jiro Dreams of Sushi |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322033824/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/jiro_dreams_of_sushi-film36081.html |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}</ref> in the same year.

Are there any unrealized wishes in his life? Secret diversions? Regrets? If you find an occupation you love and spend your entire life working at it, is that enough?  Standing behind his counter, Jiro notices things. Some customers are left-handed, some right-handed. That helps determine where they are seated at his counter. As he serves a perfect piece of sushi, he observes it being eaten. He knows the history of that piece of seafood. He knows his staff has recently started massaging an octopus for 45 minutes and not half an hour, for example. Does he search a customer's eyes for a signal that this change has been an improvement? Half an hour of massage was good enough to win three [[Michelin Guide|Michelin stars]].</blockquote>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nGelb, a \"huge [[Philip Glass]] fan\", has commented on his use of Philip Glass compositions in the film's soundtrack:<ref>{{cite web| title= Filming the Greatest Sushi Chef in the World: A Conversation With David Gelb| url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/03/09/jiro_dreams_of_sushi_director_david_gelb_talks_about_sushi_slo_mo_and_philip_glass.html | publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 9, 2012 | first= L.V. |last=Anderson| accessdate= 2013-01-16}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In hindsight, I think it works because Philip Glass's music is kind of a metaphor for Jiro's work ethic, because it's repetitive but it also builds on itself and escalates, and it's the same with Jiro's work. Because every day he's going, he's doing the same routine, and trying to do everything exactly the same, but just reaching for that one step of improvement, and I feel like the music's doing the same thing, so they match perfectly.</blockquote>\n\nThe soundtrack includes the following:<ref>{{cite web|title=Jiro Dreams of Sushi|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/jiro-dreams-of-sushi/|website=soundtracks.net|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n# [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]: [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D, Opus 35]] \u2013 Allegro Moderato.
