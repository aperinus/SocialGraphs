Norton]] and starring [[William Katt]], [[Sean Young]], [[Patrick McGoohan]], and [[Julian Fellowes]]. The film follows paleontologist Susan Matthews-Loomis and her husband George, who stumble upon [[Brontosaurus]] on an expedition in [[Central Africa]] while trying to track down a local monster. The two are pursued by the African military in an attempt to protect a baby dino and its parents.\n\nProduced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] and released on its [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone Films label]], it was first released on March 22, 1985.  A recut version was broadcast on American television by [[NBC]] in 1989 under the title ''Dinosaur...Secret of the Lost Legend'' as part of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|The Magical World of Disney]]''.<ref>Wonderful World of Disney Television</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring an expedition into [[Central Africa]], paleontologist Dr. Susan Matthews-Loomis and her husband George Loomis attempt to track down evidence of a local monster legend. The monster, which the local natives refer to as \"[[Mokele-mbembe]]\", shares many characteristics with the [[Sauropod]] order of dinosaurs. During the expedition, they discover ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in the deep jungle and are further amazed when the animals show very little fear of them. The couple begins observing the creatures and become especially enamored with the curious young offspring of the pair, whom they nickname \"Baby\". Unfortunately, the discovery soon places the dinosaurs in jeopardy from both the local military as well as fellow scientist Dr. Eric Kiviat.\n\nWhereas Dr. Kiviat sees Baby and his parents as his ticket to fame and fortune, the African military led by Colonel Nsogbu sees the dinosaurs as a threat and makes several attempts to destroy them. During one such attempt, one of the adult ''Brontosaurus'' is killed and the other captured. The Loomises are able to escape with Baby, but quickly find themselves lost in the jungle while being pursued by Colonel Nsogbu's forces. After finally escaping their pursuers, the pair decide to circle back and rescue the captive parent, whom Dr. Kiviat has persuaded Colonel Nsogbu to transport back to civilization.\n\nWith the aid of the local tribe \u2013 who see Baby and his parents as legends \u2013 George and Susan are able to break into the military compound and release the adult ''Brontosaurus''. During the escape, both Kiviat and Nsogbu are killed. Afterwards, the Loomises take the pair to a secluded jungle lagoon and say a tearful goodbye to Baby as he follows his lone parent away into the deeper parts of the jungle.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[William Katt]] as George Loomis\n* [[Sean Young]] as Dr. Susan Matthews-Loomis\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as Dr. Eric Kiviat\n* [[Julian Fellowes]] as Nigel Jenkins\n* [[Roar (1981 film)|Kyalo Mativo]] as Cephu\n* [[Hugh Quarshie]] as Kenge Obe\n* [[Olu Jacobs]] as Col.
