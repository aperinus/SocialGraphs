The plot concerns an American girl at a remote [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[boarding school]] who discovers she has psychic powers that allow her to communicate with insects, and uses them to pursue a [[serial killer]] who is butchering young women at and around the school.\n\nAfter its release in Italy, ''Phenomena'' was purchased for distribution in the United States by [[New Line Cinema]], who excised over 20 minutes of the original cut, releasing it under the alternate title '''''Creepers'''''. This shortened version was also released in the United Kingdom the following year in the spring of 1986.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter missing a bus in the Swiss countryside, a 14-year-old [[Denmark|Danish]] tourist, Vera Brandt, tries looking for help. She comes across a cottage and is attacked and beheaded by a stranger. Eight months later, her case is being inspected by forensic [[entomologist]] John McGregor and Inspector Rudolf Geiger of the [[Kantonspolizei Z\u00fcrich|Kantonpolizei]], who note that Brandt is but the first of a series of murders against young girls, including McGregor's former assistant.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer Corvino, the daughter of a famous American actor, arrives at the Swiss [[Richard Wagner]] Academy for Girls, chaperoned by Frau Br\u00fcckner, who places her with roommate Sophie. While sleepwalking through the academy and out onto the roof, Jennifer witnesses a student being murdered. She awakens and flees into the woods, where McGregor's [[chimpanzee]], Inga, finds her and leads her to him. Upon noticing the affection his captive insects have for Jennifer, McGregor comes to believe that she has a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with them. Back at the academy, the headmistress has Jennifer medically tested via [[EEG]] for her sleepwalking. The procedure makes Jennifer uneasy when she gets brief visions of the previous night's events.\n\nThe following night, the murderer kills Sophie, mistaking her for Jennifer as she is wearing the same sweater she wore when she witnessed the prior murder. Jennifer sleepwalks again and is led by a [[firefly]] to the scene of Sophie's death, where she finds a maggot-infested glove. She shows it to McGregor, who identifies the maggots as the larvae of [[Flesh fly|Great Sarcophagus flies]], which are drawn to decaying human flesh. He theorises that the killer is a [[Necrophilia|necrophile]] who has been keeping his victims close to him post-mortem, unintentionally collecting the maggots on himself.\n\nLater, when the other students taunt Jennifer over her connection to insects, she summons a swarm of flies that covers the entire building, then faints. Convinced that Jennifer is \"diabolic\" and possibly responsible for the killings, the headmistress arranges for her to be transferred to a mental hospital. Jennifer flees to McGregor's home, where the entomologist gives her a glass case with a Great Sarcophagus fly, suggesting she use it to find the murderer's lair. The fly leads her to the same cottage Brandt had found earlier and Inspector Geiger talks to the real estate agent in order to learn the identity of the house's previous occupant.\n\nThat night, McGregor is murdered in his home. With nowhere left to go, Jennifer calls her father's lawyer Morris Shapiro to take her back to America. He alerts Br\u00fcckner, who offers to let the girl stay at her house overnight. Meanwhile, Geiger's investigation leads him to a mental hospital in [[Basel]] where he learns that a former staff member had been attacked 15 years before by one of the male inmates.\n\nUpon arriving at Br\u00fcckner's house, Jennifer notices that all the mirrors are covered, with Br\u00fcckner explaining that she has a son who cannot stand to see his own reflection. Br\u00fcckner insists that Jennifer take pills before she goes to bed; when she does so, she becomes sick and, assuming that the pills are poisonous, coughs them up. She attempts to call Morris but is knocked unconscious by Br\u00fcckner. Geiger arrives and questions Br\u00fcckner, who confirms that she had worked at the Basel mental hospital and been raped. She leads him to the basement and imprisons him.\n\nAfter waking, Jennifer engineers her escape through the basement. There, she finds Geiger and falls into a pool filled with maggot-infested corpses. Br\u00fcckner taunts Jennifer, but Geiger frees himself and furiously beats Br\u00fcckner long enough to let Jennifer escape.\n\nJennifer finds Br\u00fcckner's son, who has a hideously deformed face. He chases Jennifer onto a motorboat and tries to kill her with a spear, which perforates the boat's fuel tank and causes a leak. Jennifer summons a swarm of flies that attack the killer, causing him to fall into the water. Jennifer is also forced to jump into the water as the leaking petrol ignites, whereupon the child grabs her, but he is immolated by the flames.\n\nJennifer reaches the shore just as Morris appears. A severely injured and disfigured Br\u00fcckner decapitates him from behind with a metal sheet and confesses that she murdered McGregor and Geiger to protect her son. Before she can murder Jennifer, a wrathful Inga attacks Br\u00fcckner and kills her with a straight-razor in retribution for McGregor's death. With the ordeal over, Jennifer and Inga embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Jennifer Corvino\n* [[Daria Nicolodi]] as Frau Br\u00fcckner\n* [[Dalila Di Lazzaro]] as Headmistress\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Inspector Rudolf Geiger\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Professor John McGregor\n* Tanga as Inga\n* Fiore Argento as Vera Brandt\n* Federica Mastroianni as Sophie\n* [[Kaspar Capparoni|Gaspare Capparoni]] as Karl\n* Fiorenza Tessari as Gisela Sulzer\n* Mario Donatone as Morris Shapiro\n* Francesca Ottaviani as Nurse\n* [[Michele Soavi]] as Kurt, Geiger's assistant\n* Franco Trevisi as Real Estate Agent\n* Davide Marotta as Patau Br\u00fcckner\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quoted=1|When I was thinking of ''Phenomena'', I imagined that between 1940 and 1945 there had been a very serious incident, the war, and that the Nazis had won.
