It is set in the distant future, where a man known as JP takes on great risks for the chance of winning the titular underground race.\n\nThe film was in production for seven years, and used over 100,000 [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn frames]]. It premiered at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] on August 14, 2009, and was theatrically released in Japan on October 9, 2010 by [[Tohokushinsha Film]]. Despite positive reviews, with particular praise for its animation, ''Redline'' was unsuccessful at the box office. It saw greater success following its home release, and is considered a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the planet Dorothy, \"Sweet\" JP races in the Yellowline car race, the final elimination race to the most popular race in the galaxy, the Redline. JP's alien mechanic, Frisbee, watches the televised race along with a mafia boss, with whom they have fixed the race. When JP, who was supposed to come in 2nd place, attempts to win anyway, Frisbee resorts to remotely detonating an explosive hidden under JP's TransAM20000, thereby making Sonoshee \"Cherry Boy Hunter\" McLaren the final winner. While recuperating from the explosion in a hospital, Frisbee tells JP he's off the hook with his [[Bail bondsman|bondsman]]. JP initially turns down the money but a crowd of reporters storms the hospital room where JP learns that he has been voted by popular demand for the Redline following the dropout of two qualifiers due to the revelation of the race's location being on Roboworld \u2014 a planet dominated by militant zealot [[cyborg]]s whose President has threatened on to hang all involved with the Redline mothership if it appears out of hyperspace over their planet.\n\nWhile the racers are staying on Roboworld's moon, EU\u042fPSS - a de-militarized zone that Roboworld signed away to refugees in the M-3 Nebula Federation, Frisbee's alien junk dealer Old Man Mole protests the presence of Frisbee on their team and his insistence on using a rare uncontrollable hyper-powered engine, but eventually gives in to JP's convincing. JP finds Sonoshee in a restaurant on the moon, where many of the racers are converging. Trava, a racer, is attacked by Little Deyzuna, a recently [[AWOL]] subordinate of Col. Volton, but the restaurant is soon raided by Col. Volton and a squad of Roboworld soldiers. Volton reminds the racers any Redline event will be repelled by the army and police before retrieving Deyzuna and leaving the damaged restaurant. Fireworks celebrations and [[bookmaker]] agent desks break out on Roboworld despite the threats from the military, and are raided by deadly android police robots. Miners on Roboworld use their power suits to sabotage the military base's power station while the Race Commission hires Earth-native racing partners Lynchman and Johnny Boya to sabotage an Orbital Disintegration Cannon, which Secretary of Defense Titan plans to use to destroy the Redline mothership the instant it comes out of hyperspace.\n\nWhile in hyperspace, the Princess from the planet Supergrass marks the race course on the military base with a pair of scout vessels. Unaware of the sabotage against the Orbital Disintegration Cannon, the President realizes the racers are on the planet after the cannon fails, and sends his troops ''en masse'' at the racers. The President becomes increasingly desperate as the racers evade them and approach the mine-laden Zone \"Seven-Ex\", lair of a secret illegal biological weapon named 'Funky Boy', who awakens from its stasis as the racers and the rebellious miners converge on it. With the several hundred foot tall Funky Boy awakening and subsequent destruction of the base coinciding with the orbital cannon coming back online, the President orders Funky Boy fired upon. The explosion takes out most of the Roboworld troops while JP pushes to right his overturned car off its side. Sonoshee, her vehicle totaled, agrees to ride with him to the finish line as Funky Boy regenerates. Funky Boy is taken out by Col. Volton, who dangerously merges with another bioweapon to do so. Frisbee watches the race in the mob boss's hovercraft, where he revives the same deal as Yellowline. Frisbee however, refuses to detonate the explosive charge, wanting to see his friend win just one time. He is attacked by mobsters for his decision but is saved by Old Man Mole, who discovered Frisbee's sabotage, and kills the mob boss and his lackeys. As the race nears the finish line, long time winner and Redline favourite Machinehead and JP race to the southern line boosted by their rare Steamlight boosters. As they come to a desperate neck-and-neck finish, a drunken Old Man Mole accidentally detonates Frisbee's remote explosive, propelling JP and Sonoshee towards the finish line, thrown from their vehicle. The boost is enough and JP wins by the length of his long duck tail [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]]. As the racers rest at the end of the track amidst the ruins of Roboworld, JP and Sonoshee float back down to the ground kissing and declaring their love for each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Character\n! colspan=2|Cast\n|-\n!

''Redline'' is a declaration of war.\" Zoth went on to praise the film for its \"imaginative creatures and clever designs\", to compare Koike's work to that of [[Quentin Tarantino]], and to compliment the film for its \"soundtrack, with its memorable high-energy tracks that greatly complement the chaos onscreen.\" He concludes by saying that if \"the life of the industry has been drained and replaced with rote, cookiecutter shows-by-committee, ''Redline'' shows a path out.\"<ref name=\"mania-review\"/> Nicolas Penedo of the French magazine ''Animeland'' describes it as the \"[[Paris-Dakar]] revisited \u00e0 la ''[[\u014cban Star-Racers]]''\",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Penedo |first=Nicolas |date=July\u2013August 2010 |title=''Redline'' Les fous du volants |journal=Animeland |issue=163 |issn=1148-0807 |quote=le Paris-Dakar est revisit\u00e9 fa\u00e7on ''\u00d4ban Star-Racers!'' |url=http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |access-date=October 1, 2010 |language=fr |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201215251/http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |url-status=live }}</ref> a remake of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions|Hanna-Barbera]] ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'' with arts inspired from [[Jack Kirby]] comics and know-how, rhythm and energy inherent of the best Japanese anime movies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Penedo |first=Nicolas |date=July\u2013August 2010 |title=''Redline'' Les fous du volants |journal=Animeland |issue=163 |issn=1148-0807 |quote=''remake'' des ''Fous du volants'', ce vieux dessin anim\u00e9 d'HANA & BARBERA, mais matin\u00e9 d'un graphisme inspir\u00e9 des ''comics book'' de Jack Kirby, le tout avec un savoir faire, un rythme et une \u00e9nergie propres au meilleurs films d'animation nippons! |url=http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |access-date=October 1, 2010 |language=fr |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201215251/http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |url-status=live }}</ref> The reviewer praises the animation quality as breathtaking,<ref name=\"animeland\">{{cite journal |last=Penedo |first=Nicolas |date=July\u2013August 2010 |title=''Redline'' Les fous du volants |journal=Animeland |issue=163 |issn=1148-0807 |url=http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |access-date=October 1, 2010 |language=fr |archive-date=December 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201215251/http://www.animeland.com/articles/voir/859/AnimeLand-163 |url-status=live }}</ref> and declares that Takeshi Koike made an homage to comics and films of the 70s and 80s.<ref name=\"animeland\"/>\n\nKwenton Bellette and Peter Martin reviewed ''Redline'' for [[Twitch Film]]. Bellette describes it as a \"truly out of this world experience\", \"''[[Speed Racer]]'' on crack\" and praised the supporting characters for being memorable and the background galaxy made of different races and creeds to be very solid.<ref name=\"twitch1\"/> Martin expresses that \"it feels like every centimeter of every frame is filled with some kind of kinetic color or action or bit of business, making it an experience that is sure to overload the senses\" and asserts that writer Katsuhito Ishii succeeds at making a feature-length anime as insane as his film ''[[Funky

here\", and notes that the film's \"cinema-quality smooth animation\" makes \"even the most alien of things move naturally and the sense of speed that is often achieved is frequently mind-blowing.\" He remarks that \"the visuals and over-the-top action will most likely overload sensitive brain cells,\" but concludes by calling ''Redline'' \"an incredibly exciting cinematic experience that doesn't
