''Ninotchka'' is [[Greta Garbo]]'s first full comedy, and her penultimate film; she received her third and final [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. It is one of the first American films which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]] as being rigid and gray, in this instance comparing it with the free and sunny Parisian society of pre-war years.\n\n==Plot==\nIranoff ([[Sig Ruman]]), Buljanoff ([[Felix Bressart]]), and Kopalski ([[Alexander Granach]]), three agents from the Russian Board of Trade arrive in Paris to sell jewelry confiscated from the aristocracy during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\nCount Alexis Rakonin ([[Gregory Gaye]]), a [[White russian emigre|White Russian]] [[nobleman]] reduced to employment as a waiter in the hotel where the trio are staying, overhears details of their mission and informs the former Russian Grand Duchess Swana ([[Ina Claire]]) that her court jewels are to be sold by the three men. Her debonair paramour, Count Leon d'Algout ([[Melvyn Douglas]]) offers to help retrieve the jewelry before it is sold.\n\nIn their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski negotiate with Mercier ([[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]]) a prominent Parisian jeweler, when Leon interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels were seized illegally by the Soviet government and a petition has been filed preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewelry until the lawsuit is settled.\n\nThe amiable, charming and cunning Leon treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their friendship and confidence. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise.\n\nMoscow, angered by the telegram, then sends Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova ([[Greta Garbo]]), a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewelry sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission.\n\nNinotchka and Leon first meet outside the hotel, their respective identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, Leon follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Intrigued by his behavior, Ninotchka tells him he might warrant study and suggests they go to his apartment. Ninotchka becomes attracted to Leon and eventually, they begin to kiss but are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Both realizing they are each other's adversaries over the jewelry, Ninotchka promptly leaves Leon's apartment, despite his protestations.\n\nWhile attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the west and by the persistent Leon, who has fallen in love with her and broken down her resistance. At a dinner date with Leon where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewelry and for Leon's affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakened by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewelry during the night. Swana tells Ninotchka that she will return the jewels and drop the litigation if Ninotchka returns to Moscow immediately so that Swana can have Leon to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees to Swana's proposal and after completing the sale of the jewelry to Mercier, Ninotchka and the three Russians fly back to Moscow.\nMeanwhile, Leon visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs Leon that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility.\n\nSometime later, in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to her [[communal apartment]] for dinner and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. After dinner, Ninotchka finally receives a letter from Leon, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated.\n\nMore time passes; Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski once again run afoul of their superiors after they fail at their mission to sell furs in [[Constantinople]]. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is sent by Commissar Razinin ([[Bela Lugosi]]) to investigate and retrieve the trio.\n\nAfter Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, the three Russians inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to Moscow. When Ninotchka asks them who was responsible for this idea, they point to a balcony where Leon is standing. He explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and the three Russians conspired to get her to leave the country. He  asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees.\n\nThe final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ninotchka trailer (1939).webm|thumbtime=30|upright=1.0|thumb|right|''Ninotchka'' trailer]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Greta Garbo]] as Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova \n* [[Melvyn Douglas]] as Count L\u00e9on d'Algout\n* [[Ina Claire]] as Grand Duchess Swana \n* [[Sig Ruman]] as Iranoff\n* [[Felix Bressart]] as Buljanoff \n* [[Alexander Granach]] as Kopalski \n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as Commissar Razinin \n* [[Rolfe Sedan]] as Hotel Manager\n* [[Gregory Gaye]] as Count Alexis Rakonin \n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Mercier\n* [[Richard Carle]] as Gaston\n* [[Tamara Shayne]] as Anna (uncredited)\n* [[George Tobias]] as Russian visa official (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Judels]] as Pere Mathieu, the caf\u00e9 owner (uncredited)\n* [[Edwin Stanley]] as Soviet lawyer (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe movie was released in late 1939, shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, where it became a great success. It was, however, banned in the Soviet Union and its satellites. Despite that, it went on to make $2,279,000 worldwide. USA: $1,187,000. International: $1,092,000. Profit: $138,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.garboforever.com/Film-33.htm|title=NINOTCHKA|website=www.garboforever.com}}</ref>\n\nIn a play on the famous \"Garbo Talks!\" ad campaign used for her \"[[talkie]]\" debut in ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930), ''Ninotchka'' was marketed with the catchphrase \"Garbo Laughs!\", commenting on Garbo's largely somber and melancholy image (though Garbo laughs several times in many of her previous pictures).\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Douglas-Ninotchka.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Greta Garbo as Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova and Melvyn Douglas as Count L\u00e9on d'Algout]]\n\n===Critical response===\nWhen the film was first released, ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Frank S. Nugent]] praised it:{{blockquote|The comedy, through Mr. Douglas's debonair performance and those of Ina Claire as the duchess and Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach as the unholy three emissaries; through Mr. Lubitsch's facile direction; and through the cleverly written script of Walter Reisch, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, has come off brilliantly. Stalin, we repeat, won't like it; but, unless your tastes hew too closely to the party line, we think you will, immensely.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801EFD8153EE23ABC4852DFB7678382629EDE Nugent, Frank S]. ''The New York Times'', film review, November 10, 1939.  Last accessed: December 24, 2013.</ref>}}\n\nMore recently, in 2008, film critic Dennis Schwartz{{who |date=September 2022}} discussed the humor of ''Ninotchka'':{{blockquote|The sly political jokes include Garbo saying: \"The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians\" and there are a few well-placed jokes mocking the failed [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Five-Year-Plan]]. The most noteworthy Lubitsch touch scene revolves around a stag feast in a luxury hotel ordered by capitalist Douglas for the three grateful comrade emissaries, who can't believe their good fortune. The film was funny in spots, but I thought it was also crude, lacked the usual Lubitsch subtleties, was not up to speed with the better earlier Lubitsch comedies and that the last half hour really slowed things down with an uninteresting artificial resolution.<ref>[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/ninotchka.htm Schwartz, Dennis].

Last accessed: December 24, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n===Revival===\nAn attempt by MGM to re-release ''Ninotchka'' later during [[World War II]] was suppressed on the grounds that the [[Soviet]]s were then allies of the West. The film was re-released after the war ended.<ref name=\"kennet163\">Lee Kennett, ''For the Duration. . . : The United States Goes To War'' p 164 {{ISBN|0-684-18239-4}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nIn 1955, the [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', based on ''Ninotchka'',  opened on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]]. Written by [[Cole Porter]], the stage production was based on ''Ninotchka's'' story and script and starred [[Hildegard Neff]] and [[Don Ameche]]. MGM then produced a [[Silk Stockings (1957 film)|1957 film version]] of the musical  directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]] and starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Cyd Charisse]]. Actor [[George Tobias]], who appeared uncredited in ''Ninotchka'' as the Russian official who is punched by Leon for refusing him a visa is featured as Commissar Markovitch in ''Silk Stockings''. [[Rolfe Sedan]], who portrayed the hotel manager in ''Ninotchka'', appears uncredited as a stage manager in ''Silk Stockings''. The MGM films ''[[Comrade X]]'' (1940), starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Hedy Lamarr]], and ''[[The Iron Petticoat]]'' (1956), starring [[Bob Hope]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]], both borrow heavily from ''Ninotchka''.\n\nMGM had scheduled ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'' as Garbo's next film, but pleased with the success of ''Ninotchka'', the studio quickly decided to team Garbo and Douglas in another romantic comedy. ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941) was the result and Garbo received the worst reviews of her entire career. It turned out to be her final film and [[Greer Garson]] eventually starred in ''Madame Curie''.\n\nIn 1990, ''Ninotchka'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also included the film on the magazine's list of \"All-Time 100 Movies\".<ref>Corliss, Richard (2011).
