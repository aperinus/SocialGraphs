He is opposed by young swineherder [[Taran (character)|Taran]], the young [[Princess Eilonwy]], the [[harp]]-playing [[bard]] [[Fflewddur Fflam]], and a friendly wild creature named [[Gurgi]], who seek to destroy the cauldron to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.\n\nThe film is directed by [[Ted Berman]] and [[Richard Rich (filmmaker)|Richard Rich]], who had directed Disney's previous animated film ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981), and was the first Disney animated film to be recorded in [[Dolby Stereo]]. Disney acquired the film rights to the books in 1973 with production beginning in 1980 to be set for a Christmas 1984 release. During production, it had a severe editing process, particularly for its climactic sequence, which proved to be disturbing to children. The newly appointed [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered those scenes to be cut, fearing that it would alienate children, and as a result, it was delayed to 1985. It features the voices of Grant Bardsley, [[Susan Sheridan]], [[Freddie Jones]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[Arthur Malet]], [[John Byner]], [[Phil Fondacaro]] and [[John Hurt]]. The narration of the movie is provided by famed actor and director [[John Huston]].\n\nIt was the first Disney animated film to receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#PG|PG rating]] as well as the first Disney animated film to feature [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> The film was distributed theatrically through [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] on July 24, 1985 to mixed reviews, with critics voicing disapproval of its dark nature and disjointed writing, though the animation, soundtrack, and voice acting were praised. Being the most expensive animated film ever made at the time, it was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing just $21 million against a budget of $44 million, putting the future of Disney's animation department in jeopardy. Because of its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home media until 1998. It has since gained a [[Cult film|cult following]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popoptiq.com/how-the-black-cauldron-became-a-cult-classic/|title=How 'The Black Cauldron' Became a Cult Classic|first=Elizabeth|last=Rico|date=February 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 637 words.-->\nIn the land of Prydain, [[Taran (character)|Taran]], a teenage boy and \"assistant pig-keeper\" on the small farm of [[Caer Dallben]], home of [[Dallben]] the Enchanter, dreams of becoming a famous warrior. Dallben learns that the evil [[Horned King]] is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which can create an invincible army of undead warriors: the \"Cauldron-Born\". Dallben fears that the Horned King might use his pig, [[Hen Wen]], who has [[oracle|oracular powers]], to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King's [[dragon]]-like creatures.\n\nTaran follows them to the Horned King's castle and meets the pestering dog-like creature, [[Gurgi]], who wants to be his friend. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics and cowardice, Taran leaves him. Taran sneaks into the castle and helps Hen Wen escape but is captured and thrown into the dungeon. Another captive named [[Princess Eilonwy]] frees him as she tries to escape. In the [[Spiral Castle|catacombs underneath the castle]], Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king. Taran arms himself with [[Dyrnwyn|the king's sword]] which contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned King's minions, thus fulfilling his dream. Along with a third prisoner, the comical middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are found by Gurgi. Upon learning that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin and chief henchman, Creeper, to send the Gwythaints to follow and capture Taran along with his friends.\n\nFollowing Hen Wen's trail, the four companions stumble into the underground kingdom of the [[Fair Folk]] who have Hen Wen under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals the cauldron's location, Taran decides to destroy it. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man [[Doli (fictional character)|Doli]] is assigned to lead them to the [[Marshes of Morva]] while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen back to Caer Dallben. At Morva, they learn the cauldron is held by [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|three witches]]\u2014the crafty leader Orddu, the greedy Orgoch, and the more benevolent Orwen (who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight). Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword and he reluctantly agrees, knowing that it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal the cauldron is indestructible, and its power can only be broken when someone willingly climbs into it, which will kill them. Doli angrily abandons the group. Although Taran feels foolish for trading the sword for nothing, his companions show their belief in him. Eilonwy and Taran almost kiss as Fflewddur and Gurgi happily watch. Suddenly they are found by the Horned King's minions who had followed them. Gurgi runs away before they take the cauldron and the three companions back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world while holding the trio prisoners in view of the cauldron.\n\nGurgi, deciding not to abandon his friends this time, sneaks into the castle and rescues them. Taran decides to jump into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi stops him and jumps in instead, killing the Cauldron-born as well as himself. When the Horned King spots Taran, he blames him, saying that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron. But the cauldron is out of control and consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire, killing him and destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever, as the companions escape.\n\nThe three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. Taran has finally realized Gurgi's true friendship while hailing him as a hero, and asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his magical sword permanently. Upon hearing Fflewddur's challenging remarks to demonstrate their powers, the reluctant witches honor the request, returning Gurgi to them. At first, Gurgi appears to be dead but is resurrected; much to everyone's joy. After they reunite, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back home to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* Grant Bardsley as [[Taran (character)|Taran]]\n* [[Susan Sheridan]] as [[Princess Eilonwy]]\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as [[Dallben]]\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[Fflewddur Fflam]]\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as King [[Eiddileg|Eidilleg]]\n* [[John Byner]] as [[Gurgi]] and [[Doli (character)|Doli]]\n* [[Phil Fondacaro]] as Creeper\n* [[John Hurt]] as The [[Horned King]]\n* Eda Reiss Merin as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orddu]]\n* Adele Malis-Morey as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orwen]]\n* [[Billie Hayes]] as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orgoch]]\n* [[Peter Renaday]], [[Wayne Allwine]], James Almanzar, Fondacaro, Steve Hale, [[Phil Nibbelink]], and Jack Laing as the Horned King's Henchmen \n* [[John Huston]] as Narrator\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nWalt Disney Productions [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] Lloyd Alexander's five-volume series in 1971,<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> and pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander's books were finally obtained.

Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}}\n\nThe film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes,<ref name=\"peraza\" /> with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}} Many of the deleted scenes involved extended character interactions, but other edits involved violent content, including the undead \"Cauldron-Born\", who are used as the Horned King's army in the film's final act. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron-Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron-Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"SlateRevisiting\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\nInvented by David W.
