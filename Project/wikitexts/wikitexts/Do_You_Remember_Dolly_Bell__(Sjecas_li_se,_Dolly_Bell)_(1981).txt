Simultaneous to being enthralled with a life that flashes before his eyes and ears in the local cinema and youth centre (where, among other things, he watches [[Alessandro Blasetti]]'s ''[[Europa di notte|European Nights]]'' and listens to [[Adriano Celentano]]'s \"[[24 Mila Baci]]\"), Dino gets a taste of the world inhabited by local thugs and petty criminals. However, when he is rewarded via a liaison for providing a hiding place for prostitute \"Dolly Bell\" ([[Ljiljana Blagojevi\u0107]]), his world is turned upside down as he falls in love with her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Slavko \u0160timac]] - Dino\n* [[Slobodan Aligrudi\u0107]] - Father\n* [[Ljiljana Blagojevi\u0107]] - Dolly Bell\n* [[Mira Banjac]] - Mother\n* [[Pavle Vuisi\u0107]] - Uncle\n* [[Nada Pani]] - Aunt\n* [[Boro Stjepanovi\u0107]] - Cvikera\u0161\n* [[\u017dika Risti\u0107]] - \u010ci\u010da\n* [[Jasmin Celo]]\n* [[Mirsad Zuli\u0107]]\n* [[Ismet Delahmet]]\n* [[Jovanka Paripovi\u0107]]\n* [[Mahir Imamovi\u0107]]\n* [[Zakira Stjepanovi\u0107]]\n* [[Tomislav Geli\u0107]]\n* [[Sanela Spahovi\u0107]]\n* [[Fahrudin Ahmetbegovi\u0107]]\n* [[Samir Ruzni\u0107]]\n* [[Dragan Suvak]]\n* [[Aleksandar Zurovac]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Yugoslavian films]]\n* [[List of submissions to the 54th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Yugoslav submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0083089|title=Sjecas li se Dolly Bell}}\n\n{{Emir Kusturica}}\n\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Emir Kusturica]]\n[[Category:Serbo-Croatian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Sarajevo]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav comedy films]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav romance films]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Yugoslavia]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution]]\n[[Category:Films set in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n\n\n{{Yugoslavia-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
