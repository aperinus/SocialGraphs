They have just completed a 1/20th scale model of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|great pyramid]], complete with a gold capstone. It will be months before he can sign up for another class. He tells Flynn\u2014who does not know the names of his fellow students\u2014 that he lacks real-life experience and needs to see life outside of college. Flynn's mother, Margie ([[Olympia Dukakis]]), says the same thing. She is constantly worried about her son and encourages him to get a job, find a wife, and be happy.\n\nFlynn receives a mysterious, magical invitation to interview \"for a prestigious position\" at the Metropolitan Public Library. Shortly after his odd but successful interview with humorless library administrator, Charlene ([[Jane Curtin]])\u2014and one vital question from a disembodied voice\u2014he is shown the true Library by the owner of the voice, Judson ([[Bob Newhart]]). The position of Librarian has existed for thousands of years. His role is to protect historical and often magical items stored in a vast secret space far below the \"real\" library. The items for which Flynn is responsible include [[Pandora's box|Pandora's Box]], [[Teleforce|Tesla's Death Ray]], the [[Holy Grail]], the transmuted corpse of [[Midas|King Midas]], the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the [[Golden Fleece]], a live [[unicorn]], [[the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs]], [[Excalibur]], the original ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (in the film the [[Louvre]] version is a copy), the original \"[[Little Boy]]\" prototype atomic bomb, a working jet pack, [[Ali Baba]]'s [[Magic carpet|Flying Carpet]], and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]].\n\nFlynn finds that the job entails more than he expected when one of three parts of the Spear of Destiny is stolen by a cult known as the Serpent Brotherhood, led by the former librarian Wilde ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who had faked his own death. (The audience learns of Wilde's involvement immediately.) Judson explains that whoever has the complete Spear of Destiny will control the destiny of the entire world (it is said in the film that \"Hitler had only one\" piece of the Spear). Flynn is the only one on Earth who can track down the remaining two pieces and prevent the Serpent Brotherhood from possessing all three. He heads off to the Amazon jungle, with only two tools: his mind and a book written in a previously untranslated language called the \"[[Language of the birds]].\u201d\n\nOn the plane, Flynn is ambushed by members of the Serpent Brotherhood and is rescued by a woman who forces him out of the plane in mid-air. Once they land, he finds that his rescuer, Nicole Noone ([[Sonya Walger]]), has been sent by Judson. She works for the Library in the role later defined as Guardian. She fell in love with the last Librarian and blames herself for his death. She resists any friendly feelings for Flynn. As the two travel through the Amazon rainforest, they encounter waterfalls, [[Headhunting|headhunters]], bridge collapses, and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] death traps, which they manage to survive with little difficulty thanks to Flynn's extensive knowledge and Nicole's physical prowess. They retrieve the second piece of the spear and are immediately captured by the brotherhood and Wilde, who is about to shoot Nicole when Flynn steps in front of her. He makes a deal to find the last piece of the spear in exchange for Nicole's life. They head to [[Shangri-La]], in the [[Himalayas]].\n\nAt Shangri-La, they learn that their arrival has been prophesied. Flynn retrieves the last spear piece, the blade, and the temple starts to collapse. The monks battle the Serpent Brotherhood and Flynn and Nicole escape in a helicopter, which he flies somewhat erratically, using his book knowledge. They arrive at a hotel, where Nicole orders champagne and asks Flynn if he has read a lot of books about making love. Flynn wakes up the next morning to find Nicole, the spear blade and his clothes missing. Judson contacts him through a TV in the hotel lobby, and when he describes the conditions necessary to join the spear parts together\u2014a golden-cap-stoned pyramid, augmented by a powerful electromagnetic field during a full moon\u2014Flynn realizes that Professor Harris is in on the scheme. He tells Judson to call the Marines, he is coming home.\n\nJudson meets him outside the university building where the pyramid was reconstructed, and when Flynn asks where the Marines are, Judson flashes a tattoo and replies \u201c[[Semper fidelis|Semper Fi]]!\u201d  They watch as the Serpent Brothers, including Harris, assemble to watch Wilde call down the ancient powers and fuse the spear into one. Nicole is their prisoner. After Judson decks a henchman, he says to Flynn, \u201cI was a Librarian, too, you know.\u201d Wilde stabs one of his men, absorbing his life force through the spear, and starts for Nicole. Flynn tackles him and frees Nicole. Nicole and Judson take on the Brotherhood while Flynn follows Wilde, who tries to kill him. When the spear strikes stone the Pyramid shakes. Realizing what is happening, Flynn leads Wilde to damage the support stones, upsetting the precariously balanced structure. The capstone then falls onto Wilde, killing him. Judson and Nicole stand in a room full of unconscious people. Flynn reclaims the spear in the name of the Library, where it is displayed near Excalibur. Flynn draws the sword from its stone. Judson and Charlene show him the latest portrait in the gallery of Librarians: Flynn, holding the Spear. \u201cI hope you saved receipts,\u201d Charlene says. \n \nThree months later, Flynn is at a caf\u00e9 talking with his mother about his new job at the public library and his girlfriend, Nicole, who suddenly arrives by motorcycle and kisses Flynn, who introduces her to his Mother. Nicole informs him that the 'Deadly Scorpion League' has got their hands on [[The Time Machine|H. G. Wells' Time Machine]] (a real time machine, and not the book). As Flynn wonders aloud why so many evil groups have insect names, they take off, pursued by four members of said cult.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Flynn Carsen .28Noah Wyle.29|Flynn Carsen]]\n* [[Sonya Walger]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Nicole Noone (Sonya Walger, played by Rachel Nichols in the TV series)|Nicole Noone]]\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Judson .28Bob Newhart.29|Judson]]\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Charlene .28Jane Curtin.29|Charlene]]\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Margie Carsen .28Olympia Dukakis.29|Margie Carsen]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Edward Wilde .28Kyle MacLachlan.29|Edward Wilde]]\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Lana\n* [[David Dayan Fisher]] as Rhodes\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2003, it was announced TNT and [[Dean Devlin]]'s [[Electric Entertainment]] would team up to produce action-adventure TV film ''The Librarian'', about a student who is thrown into a world he didn\u2019t expect when he answers a classified ad to be the librarian at the New York Public Library, which turns out to be the repository of mankind\u2019s most secret and valuable artifacts.<ref name=\"TNTLibrarian\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/tnt-books-librarian-1117885812/|title=   TNT books \u2018Librarian\u2019    |publisher=Variety|access-date=March 12, 2022}}</ref> In May 2004, it was announced [[Noah Wyle]] would play the title character.<ref name=\"NoahWyleLibrarian\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/wyle-gets-librarian-card-1117905516/|title=   Wyle gets \u2018Librarian\u2019 card     |publisher=Variety|access-date=March 12, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 5 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Librarian: Quest for the Spear (2004) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/librarian_quest_for_the_spear |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= March 13, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nDavid Cornelius at eFilmCritic.com gave it a positive review: \"It's a fun cheesy cable TV flick, a slice of winking B movie giddiness that charms us into smiling through all the nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite web  |date= August 27, 2005 |author1= David Cornelius |title= Movie Review - Librarian: Quest for the Spear, The - eFilmCritic |url= https://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=12954&reviewer=392 |website=www.efilmcritic.com  }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nNominated for the 2006 Writers Guild Award for Outstanding Achievement in Writing for a Long Form (Original) (David Titcher) by the Writers Guild of America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/543783/Librarian-Quest-for-the-Spear-The/misc-notes.html|title=Librarian: Quest for the Spear, The (2004) - Misc Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==DVD==\n{{Anchor|DVD|Home media}}\nAn unrated, Region 1 NTSC DVD was released for this film on August 30, 2005, using an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1:78:1.\n\n==Sequels==\nA sequel, ''[[The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines]]'', aired on TNT on December 3, 2006.
