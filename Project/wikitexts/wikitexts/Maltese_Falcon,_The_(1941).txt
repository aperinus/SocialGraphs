She claims to be looking for her missing sister, who ran off from their home in New York and came to the city with a man named Floyd Thursby. Archer agrees to help get her sister back. However, later that night, the police inform Spade that Archer has been killed. Spade tries calling his client at her hotel to discover she has checked out. Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Police Detective Tom Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy, who tell him that Thursby was murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer.\n\nLater that morning, Spade meets his client. Now calling herself Brigid O'Shaughnessy, she confesses to creating the story and convices Spade to investigate the murders. She also reveals Thursby was her partner. He took advantage of her and probably killed Archer, but she claims to have no idea who killed Thursby. At his office, Spade meets Joel Cairo, who first offers him $5,000 to find a \"black figure of a bird\". When Spade is skeptical, Cairo pulls a gun on him and searches the room for it. Spade knocks Cairo out and goes through his belongings. When Cairo comes round, he hires Spade.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 260\n\n<!-- Header -->\n | header            = From the trailer:\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = GutmanCairoMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Gutman and Cairo meet with Spade.\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =SamConfrontBrigMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Spade confronts O'Shaughnessy.\n}}\n\nAs he goes to visit O'Shaughnessy later that evening, he is followed by a young man on the way there, but manages to evade him. When he tells her about Cairo, her nervousness indicates she knows him. He arranges a meeting between the two at his apartment, where Cairo becomes agitated when O'Shaughnessy reveals that the \"Fat Man\" is in San Francisco. When Spade goes to Cairo's hotel in the morning, he spots the young man following him earlier. His name is Wilmer, and he works for Kasper Gutman, the \"Fat Man\". In his hotel suite, Gutman relates the [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon|history of the Maltese Falcon]], then offers Spade his pick of $25,000 for the bird and another $25,000 after its sale, or a quarter of the proceeds from its sale. After Spade passes out because his drink is spiked, Wilmer and Cairo come in from another room and leave with Gutman.\n\nOn coming round, Spade searches the suite and finds a newspaper with the arrival time of the freighter ''La Paloma'' circled. He goes to the dock, only to find the ship on fire. Later, the ship's captain, Jacoby, shot several times, staggers into Spade's office before dying. The bundle he was clutching contains the Maltese Falcon. O'Shaughnessy calls the office, gives an address, then screams before the line goes dead.\n\nSpade stashes the package at the bus terminal, then goes to the address, which turns out to be an empty lot. Spade returns home to find O'Shaughnessy hiding in a doorway. He takes her inside and finds Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer waiting for him, guns drawn. Gutman gives Spade $10,000 for the Falcon, but Spade tells them that part of his price is someone he can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacoby, suggesting Wilmer, who, Gutman confirms, actually did shoot both. After some intense negotiation, Gutman and Cairo agree and Wilmer is knocked out and disarmed.\n\nJust after dawn, Spade calls his secretary, Effie Perine, to bring him the bundle. However, when Gutman inspects the statuette, he finds it is a fake and Wilmer escapes during the tumult. Recovering his composure, Gutman invites Cairo to return with him to [[Istanbul]] to continue their quest. After they leave, Spade calls the police and tells them where to pick up the pair. Spade then angrily confronts O'Shaughnessy, telling her he knows she killed Archer to implicate Thursby, her unwanted accomplice. She confesses, but begs Spade not to turn her over to the police. Despite his feelings for her, Spade gives O'Shaughnessy up.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Maltese-Falcon-Tell-the-Truth-1941.jpg|thumb|A promotional still showing O'Shaughnessy and Cairo clashing in front of the police]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as [[Sam Spade]]\n* [[Mary Astor]] as Ruth Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaughnessy\n* [[Gladys George]] as Iva Archer\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Joel Cairo\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Lieutenant Dundy\n* [[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]] as Effie Perine\n* [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as Kasper Gutman\n* [[Ward Bond]] as Detective Tom Polhaus\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] as Miles Archer\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Wilmer Cook\n* [[James Burke (actor)|James Burke]] as Luke, hotel detective\n* [[Murray Alper]] as Frank Richman, taxi driver\n* [[John Hamilton (actor)|John Hamilton]] as District Attorney Bryan\n* [[Walter Huston]] as Captain Jacoby (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nHammett had once worked as a private detective for the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton Detective Agency]] in San Francisco, and he used his birth name \"Samuel\" for the story's protagonist. He wrote of the book's main character in 1934:\n\n<blockquote>Spade has no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been, and, in their cockier moments, thought they approached.</blockquote>\n\nOther characters in ''The Maltese Falcon'' were based on people whom he met or worked with during that time.<ref name=\"intro\">[http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv244.html Introduction to ''The Maltese Falcon'' (1934 edition)]</ref> The character of sinister \"Fat Man\" Kasper Gutman was based on [[Maundy Gregory]], an overweight British detective-entrepreneur who was involved in many sophisticated endeavors and capers, including a search for a long-lost treasure like the jeweled Falcon.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> The character of Joel Cairo was based on a criminal whom Hammett arrested for forgery in [[Pasco, Washington]], in 1920.<ref name=\"intro\"/>\n\nThe novel was serialized in five parts in ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' during 1929 and 1930 before being published in book form in 1930 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Warner Bros. quickly bought the film rights of the novel, and [[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|made an adaptation]] the following year starring [[Ricardo Cortez]] and [[Bebe Daniels]]. The film closely followed the novel, including its references to homosexuality and a scene of Spade strip-searching Wonderly for a missing $1,000 bill. These topics made the film unscreenable a few years later under the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], who refused to grant the studio a certificate when they tried to re-release it in 1935. The studio remade the story as the more Code-friendly ''[[Satan Met a Lady]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Warren William]]. The film changed much of the novel's elements and became a comedy.<ref>{{cite book |title=An Open Book |url=https://archive.org/details/openbook00hust |url-access=registration |last=Huston |first=John |year=1980 |publisher=Alfred A.

[[Audio commentary]] for Disc One of the 2006 three-disc DVD special edition of ''The Maltese Falcon''.</ref> Except for some exterior night shots, Huston shot the entire film in sequence,<ref>Behlmer, p. 145.</ref> which greatly helped his actors. Much of the dialogue from the original novel was retained.

He was also warned not to show excessive drinking. The director fought the latter, on the grounds that Spade was a man who put away a half bottle of hard liquor a day and showing him completely abstaining from alcohol would mean seriously falsifying his character.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite web |last=Mills |first=Michael |title=The Maltese Falcon |work=Palace Classic Films |publisher=moderntimes.com |year=1998 |url=http://www.moderntimes.com/palace/falcon/ |access-date=February 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126102600/http://www.moderntimes.com/palace/falcon/ |archive-date=January 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:WilmerMaltFalc1941Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elisha Cook Jr.|Wilmer]], the \"gunsel\"]]\n\nBogart was not the first choice to play Sam Spade; the role was originally offered to [[George Raft]].

Bogart's convincing interpretation became the archetype for a private detective in the ''film noir'' genre, providing him acclaim and solidifying his onscreen persona. [[Ingrid Bergman]] watched ''Maltese Falcon'' over and over again while preparing for ''Casablanca'' in order to learn how to interact and act with Bogart.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nBergman, [[Joan Bennett]], [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], and [[Loretta Young]] were all considered for the role of Brigid.

Lee Patrick was initially considered for the role of Iva, but later received the part of Effie.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Having difficulty casting Kasper Gutman, Huston screen tested stage actor Sydney Greenstreet on the suggestion of producer Hal Wallis. Greenstreet, who was 61 and weighed between 280 and 350 pounds, had not appeared on film before. However, he managed to impress Huston with his sheer size, distinctive abrasive laugh, bulbous eyes, and manner of speaking.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography took place on the Warner Bros. backlot from June 9 to July 18, 1941, with some reshoots on August 8.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Following a preview screening on September 5, studio head [[Jack L.

Huston was set to direct the sequel, with Jack Warner approaching [[Dashiel Hammett]] to write a screenplay. However, Huston and Bogart's high demand and the studio's inability to agree on a salary with Hammett caused the plans to be dropped.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nThe film was adapted for radio several times. The first was for the ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' broadcast on the [[CBS]] radio network on February 1, 1942, with Bogart as star.<ref>{{cite news |title=On KFAB |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2108785/st_maltese_falcon/ |newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star|The Lincoln Star]] |date=February 1, 1942 |page=32 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=March 31, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Philip Morris Playhouse]]'' staged an adaptation August 14, 1942, with [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] starring.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arnold Is Playhouse Guest Star |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3043646/harrisburg_telegraph/ |newspaper=Harrisburg Telegraph |date=August 8, 1942 |page=25 |via=Newspapers.com |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> CBS later created a 30-minute adaptation for ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' with Bogart, Astor, Greenstreet and Lorre all reprising their roles.

Nonetheless, it did have an impacting influence on the industry. Its success launched the careers of Huston, Bogart, and Greenstreet, as well as help revitalize the career of Astor. Bogart would largely portray characters like Spade for the studio in several notable films, including ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946).\n\nThe 1975 comedy film ''[[The Black Bird]]'' directed by [[David Giler]] served as a parody sequel, starring [[George Segal]] as Sam Spade, Jr., son of the recently deceased Sam Spade forced to take over his father's agency. Lee Patrick and Elisha Cook, Jr. reprised their respective roles of Effie and Wilmer; Patrick came out of retirement for the film, which turned out to be her final acting appearance. The film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on May 9, 1975.\n\nIn 1989, ''The Maltese Falcon'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", going in the first year of voting.<ref name=\"registry\" /> Roger Ebert added it to his \"[[The Great Movies|Great Movies]]\" list.<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\n'''[[American Film Institute]] recognition'''\n* 1998 \u2013 [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movies]] \u2013 No. 23\n* 2001 \u2013 [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Thrills]] \u2013 No. 26\n* 2003 \u2013 [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Heroes and Villains]]:\n** Kasper Gutman \u2013 Nominated Villain\n** Brigid O'Shaughnessy \u2013 Nominated Villain\n* 2005 \u2013 [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** \"The stuff that dreams are made of.\" \u2013 No. 14.
