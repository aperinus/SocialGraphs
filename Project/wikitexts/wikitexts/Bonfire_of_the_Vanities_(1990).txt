The screenplay, written by [[Michael Cristofer]], was adapted from the best-selling 1987 [[The Bonfire of the Vanities|novel of the same name]] by [[Tom Wolfe]].\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing just $15 million against its $47 million budget.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> The controversies surrounding the film were detailed in the 1991 book ''The Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood'', by [[Julie Salamon]].\n\n==Plot==\nSherman McCoy is a [[Wall Street]] bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a [[Southern belle]] [[gold digger]]. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \"war-zone\" of the [[South Bronx]]. \n\nThey are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. He jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and they drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.\n\nMeanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish [[district attorney]] Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. \n\nWeiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes.\n\nFinally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlord of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment made by the building owners to prove that the woman is not in fact living in the rent-controlled apartment herself. She discovers information about the McCoy case (where Maria states she was driving the car), which she gives to Fallow, who in turn covertly supplies it to McCoy's defense attorney. \n\nSherman gets his hands on a tape and plays the recording in court, where it reveals Maria directly contradicting the evidence she has just given, showing she has been perjuring herself and causing her to faint. Sherman plays the tape on a tape recorder inside his briefcase connected to a small loudspeaker that he holds on the desk.\n\nWhen the judge orders that he approach the bench with this evidence, he asserts that the tape is his (making it admissible evidence), resulting in his acquittal. The people in the court go into an uproar, to which Judge White launches into a tirade that they have no right to act self-righteous and smarmy, or that they are above Sherman, considering Reverend Bacon claims to help disadvantaged New Yorkers but actually engages in race baiting, or that the District Attorney Weiss pushed this case not in the interest of justice but in the interest of appealing to minority voters to further his political career by appealing to their desire to \"get even\". After the Judge made his point, he begs the people to be decent and change their ways, letting Sherman go.\n\nA year later, a large audience is applauding the premiere of Fallow's book. Fallow says that Sherman McCoy has moved away from New York City to an unknown destination, presumably to live in obscurity.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast per opening tombstone credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Sherman McCoy\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Peter Fallow\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Maria Ruskin\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Judy McCoy\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Jed Kramer\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Judge Leonard White\n* [[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]] as Reverend Bacon\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Tom Killian\n* [[Clifton James]] as Albert Fox\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Ray Andruitti\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Mr. McCoy\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Rawlie Thorpe \n* [[Alan King]] as Arthur Ruskin\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Pollard Browning\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Ed Rifkin\n* [[Andre Gregory]] as Aubrey Buffing\n* [[Beth Broderick]] as Caroline Heftshank\n* [[Mary Alice]] as Annie Lamb\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Sir Gerald Moore\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Campbell McCoy\n* [[F.

When De Palma was unable to deliver an actor, the studio forced him to cast Bruce Willis, who had starred in the successful 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]''.\n\n[[Walter Matthau]] was initially offered the role of the judge, but demanded a fee of $1 million. The producers balked at meeting his price and signed [[Alan Arkin]] instead for a modest $150,000. Arkin was then replaced by [[Morgan Freeman]] when the studio decided to change the judge's ethnicity from Jewish to African American in order to respond to criticism of the film's racial politics, and dialogue was added to have the judge denounce the manipulative actions of the main characters.

The film's Second Unit Director, Eric Schwab, calculated the time and day when a runway at JFK would line up exactly with the setting sun, to serve as a backdrop, and managed to film in the single 30-second time period when this occurs in any given year, while winning a bet that he could make the scene an essential part of the movie.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070202/ai_n17205796 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118121424/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070202/ai_n17205796 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2007-11-18 | title='The Bonfire of the Vanities' (1990) | work= The Independent| location=London }}</ref> The 5-camera shot cost $80,000{{sfn|Salamon|1992|loc=[https://archive.org/details/devilscandy00juli/page/243 p. 243]}} and lasted just 10 seconds in the final cut. Schwab also directed the opening title shot\u2014an almost equally elaborate and expensive set-up requiring a 24-hour timelapse of Manhattan, from a camera platform beside a [[gargoyle]] on top of the [[Chrysler Building]].\n\nSeveral of the sets parodied the home decorated by [[Robert Denning]] and [[Vincent Fourcade]] for Carolyne Roehm and [[Henry Kravis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Vincent Fourcade - Celebrating The Pleasures Of Magnificent Excess |first=Mitchell |last=Owens |work=[[Architectural Digest]] |date=January 2000 |volume=57 |issue=1 |page=169 |quote=one of twenty-five persons named by the magazine \"Interior Design Legends\".}}</ref>\n\nThe cover of Peter Fallow's book in the film has a similar design to the original first edition of Tom Wolfe's novel from 1987.\n\nCristofer's original script ended cynically with the supposed victim of the hit-and-run walking out of the hospital, suggesting that the whole scenario was concocted. That ending did not test well with audiences and was dropped.\n\n=== Locations ===\nSherman and Judy McCoy's luxury apartment was built on the Warner Bros. stage in Burbank, designed by [[Richard Sylbert]]. The Park Avenue exteriors were shot on location late at night, using rain effects and a prop phone booth. The lobby scenes were shot at 77 Park Avenue.{{sfn|Salamon|1992|p=171}}\n\nThe courthouse interior scenes were shot at Queens County Courthouse, at night.{{sfn|Salamon|1992|p=200}} Courthouse exteriors were at the Mario Merola Building / Bronx County Courthouse.

Another courthouse scene showing a riot in slow-motion had been shot at the Essex County Courthouse in Newark but was omitted from the film following  negative reactions from test screenings.{{sfn|Salamon|p=372}}\n\nThe 330-second [[Steadicam]] shot of Peter Fallow arriving at the Palm Court of the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]] was a ''tour de force'' for operator Larry McConkey.

He felt that viewers who didn't read the novel might be confused by critical parts of the plot, and suggested Griffith and Freeman offered the best performances while Hanks was simply ineffective in his role. The film lacked the psychological depth of Wolfe's novel but \"at least it does work well in a certain glossy way.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-bonfire-of-the-vanities-1990 | title=The Bonfire of the Vanities |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert | date=December 21, 1990 | work=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\nCommenting on the way Wolfe's story was adapted, [[Brian De Palma]] said, \"The initial concept of it was incorrect. If you're going to do ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', you would have to make it a lot darker and more cynical, but because it was such an expensive movie, we tried to humanize the Sherman McCoy character{{snd}} a very unlikable character, much like the character in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]''. We could have done that if we'd been making a low-budget movie, but this was a studio movie with Tom Hanks in it. We made a couple of choices that, in retrospect, were wrong. I think [[John Lithgow]] would have been a better choice for Sherman McCoy, because he would have got the [[Nobility#\"Blue\" blood|blue-blood]] arrogance of the character.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated94\"/>\n\nHowever, De Palma has been quick to downplay the notion that the movie suffered because of studio interference: \"The initial producers, once we had cast Hanks, moved on and went over to [[Columbia Pictures]], so I was sort of left to my own devices and pursued ways in which I thought I could make this movie more commercial and keep some edge of the book... I thought we were going to get away with it, but we didn't. I knew that the people who read the book were going to be extremely unhappy, and I said, 'Well, this is a movie; it isn't the book.' And I think if you look at the movie now, and you don't know anything about the book, and you get it out of the time that it was released, I think you can see it in a whole different way.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated94\"/>\n\n==''The Devil's Candy''==\nThe controversies surrounding the film were detailed in a 1991 book called ''The Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood'' by [[Julie Salamon]], who was the film critic for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and wanted to document the novel's film adaptation. She was granted much access to the ''Bonfire'' filming by De Palma.\n\nAmong other things, the book describes how De Palma had a difficult relationship with then-rising star Bruce Willis who, in the words of Salamon, \"was generally disliked by most of the cast and crew [due to his ego]\". In one instance, during the filming of a scene in which Willis was with Alan King (the scene in which the character played by King dies), Willis challenged the crew to make the whole scene move along faster, allegedly because it was very hot on the set.\n\nAlthough Willis was called out of the set by De Palma to discuss the event, this particular scene ended up being considerably shorter and simpler than originally intended. De Palma described ''The Devil's Candy'' as \"a very good book. I let Julie Salamon see everything. She portrayed it all very accurately. But I mean, nobody realized it was going wrong when we were making it. We were very enthusiastic about what we were doing.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated94\">{{cite news|title=Brian De Palma interview |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |issue=93 |date=December 2008 |page=94}}</ref> Salamon's book was re-released in 2002 with the revised title ''The Devil's Candy: The Anatomy of a Hollywood Fiasco'' and additional material by Salamon (including Bruce Willis's negative reaction to the book).\n\nThe second season of the [[Turner Classic Movies]] podcast ''The Plot Thickens'' is named after the book and retells the story of the making of the film.
