''HollywoodTrailers.net''. Retrieved 2011-07-22.</ref> It stars [[John Cusack]], [[Alice Eve]], [[Brendan Gleeson]] and [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]. The title derives from [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe's]] 1845 poem \"[[The Raven]]\", in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated [[The Raven (1935 film)|1935]] and [[The Raven (1963 film)|1963]] films.\n\nSet in 1849,<ref name=\"TheRaven2012film-r2\" /> it is a fictionalized account of the last days of Poe's life, in which the poet and author pursues a [[serial killer]] whose murders mirror those in Poe's stories. While the plot of the film is fictional, the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe's mysterious death. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name \"Reynolds\" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on March 9, 2012 and in the United States on April 27. The film garnered mixed reviews from critics, with the [[visual effects]] and [[Film score|score]] by [[Lucas Vidal]] being praised, but the performances and [[plot twist]]s criticized.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 19th-century [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], several policemen discover a murdered woman sprawled on the floor of her apartment, which was locked from the inside. While police search for the killer's means of escape, they discover a second corpse in the chimney, later identified as the 12-year-old daughter of the first victim. A celebrated detective, Emmett Fields, is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in a short story, \"[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]\", that he once read.\n\nThe writer Edgar Allan Poe is brought to Fields for questioning. After finding the body of Griswold, a rival of Poe, cut in half by a pendulum (as in Poe's story \"[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]\"), the pair deduce that someone is staging murders based on Poe's stories. Edgar's love, Emily Hamilton, is kidnapped at her father's masquerade ball, like the one described in Poe's \"[[The Masque of the Red Death]]\". The killer taunts Poe in a note, demanding that Edgar write and publish a new story. Poe's lodgings are burned down by people who believe he is exploiting the murders for his own journalistic ends, and he is forced to move in with Fields.\n\nA clue from the killer referring to \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\" leads Poe and Fields to search the tunnels under the city with several policemen, discovering the walled-up corpse of a man dressed as Emily. They determine that the man is a sailor, and the clues on his body bring the pursuers to [[Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Holy Cross Church]], where an empty grave with Emily's name on it has been prepared. As the police attempt to break down the church doors, the killer attacks and kills one of the policemen, then shoots and wounds Fields. Poe gives chase on horseback, but the killer escapes.\n\nPoe writes one last newspaper column, offering his life for Emily's, suggesting that he could take poison. In the morning, the maid gives Poe a letter from the killer, accepting his terms, but the note was delivered long before the paper was distributed. Realizing that the killer must work at the paper, Poe races to confront his editor, Henry, but Henry is already dead, another note lying next to him.\n\nThe real killer is the paper's typesetter, Ivan Reynolds, who congratulates Poe and offers him a drink. Ivan attempts to converse with Edgar, but Poe demands Emily's location. Ivan pours a vial of poison, promising to end the story as Poe had written it. Poe agrees and drinks the liquid. Ivan quotes \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\", cluing Edgar that Emily is concealed beneath the printing floor. As the killer leaves, Poe uses the last of his strength to tear up a false section of floor and open a trapdoor leading to Emily's prison.\n\nPoe rescues Emily, and they share a poignant moment before she is taken away by ambulance. Delirious from the poison, Edgar wanders off to a park bench to die. A man walking in the park recognizes him as the famous writer, and asks if he is all right. Poe can summon only enough strength to say, \"Tell Fields his last name is Reynolds.\" Later, when Fields comes to view Poe's corpse at the hospital, the attending physician is unable to tell him the exact cause of death, but mentions that the writer was incoherent, insisting that \"his last name is Reynolds.\" Fields ponders the meaning of the phrase, slowly connecting the dots. The Hamiltons attend Poe's burial.\n\nIvan disembarks from a train in Paris. As a porter carries his luggage, Ivan climbs into a carriage and is confronted by Fields. He lunges for the detective, and Fields shoots him at point blank range.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cusack]] as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]\n* [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] as Inspector Emmett Fields\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Emily Hamilton\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Captain Charles Hamilton\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as PC John Cantrell\n* [[Jimmy Yuill]] as Captain Eldridge\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as Henry Maddux\n* [[Sam Hazeldine]] as Ivan Reynolds\n* [[Pam Ferris]] as Mrs. Bradley\n* [[John Warnaby]] as Ludwig Griswold (a reference to [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] who used the pen name Ludwig)\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as Reagan\n\n==Production==\n[[Jeremy Renner]] was originally going to star in the film (playing the role later taken by Luke Evans), but he dropped out so that he could star in ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Krystal |url=http://screencrave.com/2010-10-13/the-raven-loses-jeremy-renner-gains-luke-evans-alice-eve |title=The Raven Loses Jeremy Renner, Gains Luke Evans, Alice Eve |publisher=Screencrave.com |date=2010-10-13 |access-date=2013-12-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224183024/http://screencrave.com/2010-10-13/the-raven-loses-jeremy-renner-gains-luke-evans-alice-eve/ |archive-date=2013-12-24 }}</ref> [[Ewan McGregor]] was also in talks for a role,<ref>[https://slashfilm.com/jeremy-renner-and-ewan-mcgreggor-in-talks-james-mcteigues-raven-renner-might-also-star-in-peter-bergs-battleship \"Jeremy Renner and Ewan McGregor in Talks for James McTeigue\u2019s Raven; Renner Might Also Star in Peter Berg\u2019s Battleship\"].
