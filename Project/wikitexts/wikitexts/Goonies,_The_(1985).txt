In the film,  kids who live in the \"Goon Docks\" neighborhood of [[Astoria, Oregon]], attempt to save their homes from [[foreclosure]] and, in doing so, they discover an old [[treasure map]] that takes them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willy, a legendary 17th-century [[Piracy|pirate]]. During the adventure, they are chased by a family of criminals who want the treasure for themselves.\n\nProduced by Spielberg's [[Amblin Entertainment]], [[Warner Bros.]] released the film theatrically on June 7, 1985, in the United States. The film grossed $125 million worldwide on a budget of $19 million and has since become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.today.com/popculture/5-lessons-are-good-enough-learn-goonies-t24421 |title='Goonies' Turns 30: 5 Lessons From the Cult Classic |work=Today |date=June 5, 2015 |first=Chris |last=Sercio |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.trinitytripod.com/news/view.php/597784/The-Goonies-Cult-Classic-that-Still-Warm |title=The Goonies: Cult Classic that Still Warms Embittered Hearts |newspaper=The Trinity Tripod |date=December 5, 2006 |first=Chris |last=Clark |access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref> In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nFacing foreclosure of their homes in the Goon Docks area of Astoria, Oregon, to an expanding [[country club]], a group of children who call themselves \"the Goonies\" gather for a final weekend together. The Goonies are Mikey Walsh, his older brother Brand, Data, Mouth, Chunk, Andy and Stef.\n\nRummaging through the Walshes' attic, they come across a 1632 [[doubloon]] and an old treasure map purporting to lead to the treasure of legendary [[Piracy|pirate]] \"One-Eyed Willy\", believed to be located somewhere nearby. Mikey considers One-Eyed Willy to be the original Goonie. The kids overpower and bind Brand and make their way to an abandoned restaurant on the coast that coincides with the map; Brand soon follows alongside Andy, a cheerleader with a crush on him; and Stef, Andy's friend. The group eventually discovers that the derelict restaurant is a hideout of the Fratelli [[crime family]]: Francis, Jake, and their mother. The Goonies find a tunnel in the basement and follow it, but when Chunk flags down a motorist to go to the sheriff\u2019s station, he gets abducted by the Fratellis and imprisoned with their hulking, deformed, younger brother Sloth. The Fratellis interrogate Chunk until he reveals where the Goonies have gone, and begin pursuit. Chunk is left behind with Sloth, but befriends him. After Sloth frees both of them, Chunk calls the sheriff, and both follow the trail of the Fratellis.\n\nThe Goonies evade several deadly [[booby trap]]s along the tunnels, while staying ahead of the Fratellis. Finally, they reach the grotto where Willy's pirate ship, the ''Inferno'', is anchored. The group discovers that the ship is filled with treasure, and they start filling their pockets, but Mikey warns them not to take any on a set of scales in front of Willy, considering that to be their tribute to him. As they leave the ship, the Fratellis appear and strip them of their loot. They start to bind the Goonies and make them [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]], until Chunk arrives with Sloth and distracts the Fratellis long enough for the Goonies to jump overboard and swim to safety. Brand saves Andy from drowning and she kisses him. The Fratellis proceed to grab all the treasure they can, including those on Willy's scales; this triggers another booby trap which causes the grotto to cave in. With Sloth's help, the Goonies and Fratellis barely escape.\n\nThe two groups emerge on Astoria's beach, where they reunite with the Goonies' families and the police. The Fratellis are arrested, but Chunk prevents Sloth from also being taken; he invites Sloth to live with him, which Sloth accepts. Just as Mikey\u2019s father is about to sign the foreclosure papers, the Walshes' housekeeper, Rosalita, discovers that Mikey's marble bag is filled with gems he took from the ship and had not been seized by the Fratellis. Mikey's father triumphantly rips up the papers, declaring that they have enough money to negate the foreclosure. As they are regaling the tale of their adventure to the disbelieving press and police, they notice the ''Inferno'', having broken free of the grotto, sailing off on its own in the distance.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Michael \"Mikey\" Walsh, the [[asthma]]tic leader of the Goonies\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Brandon \"Brand\" Walsh, a high-school athlete and Mikey's older brother and minder\n* [[Jeff Cohen (actor)|Jeff Cohen]] as Lawrence \"Chunk\" Cohen, a clumsy, gluttonous member of the Goonies and habitual fabulist\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Clark \"Mouth\" Devereaux, a Goonie nicknamed for his cheeky tongue\n* [[Jonathan Ke Quan|Jonathan Ke Huy Quan]] as Richard \"Data\" Wang, a [[James Bond]] fanatic and amateur [[gadget]]eer Goonie\n* [[Kerri Green]] as Andrea Theresa \"Andy\" Carmichael, a high-school cheerleader and Brand's love interest\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Stephanie \"Stef\" Steinbrenner, Andy's best friend\n* [[John Matuszak]] as Lotney \"Sloth\" Fratelli, the deformed and abused, but child-hearted, son of the Fratelli family who Chunk befriends\n* [[Anne Ramsey]] as Mama Fratelli, an Italian-born crime matriarch\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Jake Fratelli, Mama Fratelli's son, a [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiter]], and a recently escaped fugitive\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Francis Fratelli, Mama Fratelli's favorite son\n* [[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Irene Walsh, Mikey and Brand's fussy mother\n* [[Keith Walker (writer)|Keith Walker]] as Irving Walsh, Mikey and Brand's father and a curator at the local history museum\n* [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as Rosalita, the Walsh family's Mexican housekeeper\n* [[Steve Antin]] as Troy Perkins, the spoiled son of the Astoria Country Club's millionaire owner\n* Curt Hanson as Mr. Perkins, Troy's millionaire father\n* [[Michael Paul Chan]] as Mr. Wang, Data's father\n* Charles McDaniel as Mr. Cohen, Chunk's father\n* Paul Tuerpe as the Sheriff\n* [[George Robotham]] as Prison Guard\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Chester Copperpot (Uncredited)\n\nDirector Richard Donner makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a sheriff's deputy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2015/06/07/goonies-30th-anniversary/#nq43l7cYqiqw|title=18 facts about 'The Goonies' in honor of the film's 30th anniversary|author=Sonaiya Kelley|date=7 June 2015|website=[[Mashable]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> The film's cinematographer, [[Nick McLean]], also has a cameo as Mouth's father.

During the film's [[Dramatic structure#D\u00e9nouement|''d\u00e9nouement'']], mention is made of an [[octopus]], which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut.\n\nIn the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''The Making of The Goonies'', Richard Donner noted both the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. He praised them for their energy and excitement, but also said that they were also unruly when brought together. As a result, the documentary frequently showed him coaching the actors and revealing some techniques he used to create realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship, which was actually a full-sized replica of a pirate ship created under the direction of [[production designer]] [[J. Michael Riva]]. Donner restricted the actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters; the characters' first glimpse of the ship was also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the final cut was actually the second take, due to the cast feeling so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be reshot. The entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/08/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-goonies |title=10 Things You Might Not Know About The Goonies |publisher=Tor.com |access-date=November 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''There and Back Again'', [[Sean Astin]] claimed that Donner and  Spielberg were \"like co-directors\" on the film as he compared and contrasted their styles when directing scenes.<ref name=\"Astin 135\">{{cite book |title=There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale |author1=Sean Astin |author2=Joe Layden |publisher=Macmillan |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-312-33147-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_YvkXQ-djQC&pg=PA135 |page=135}}</ref>\n\nSome of the on-location filming was done in Astoria.

The screens were largely inspired by actual sets and puzzles seen in the film. A reference to the aforementioned \"octopus scene\" is included, as the seventh level.\n\nIn 1986, Japanese game developer [[Konami]] created two versions of ''The Goonies'' for the [[MSX]] (''[[The Goonies (MSX video game)|The Goonies]]'') in Japan and Europe, and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (''[[The Goonies (Famicom video game)|The Goonies]]'')  in Japan. ''[[The Goonies II]]'' was also released on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (and its international counterpart, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]). ''The Goonies II'' was released in North America, Europe, and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the [[Nintendo VS. System]] arcade machine in the 1980s. ''The Goonies II'' has little to do with the film. In it, the Fratellis have kidnapped all the Goonies (except Mikey, whom the player guides) and have hidden them in cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes, and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named Annie.  Mikey was also a playable character in Konami's 1988 Famicom title ''[[Wai Wai World]]'', which included a Goonies-themed level.\n\nIn February 2007, [[DaimlerChrysler|Chrysler]]'s [[Jeep]] division sponsored ''The Goonies: Return to Astoria'', a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based [[online game]] developed by [[Fuel Industries]]. The player's goal is to collect map pieces and doubloons, and then race the Fratellis to One-Eyed Willy's treasure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.returntoastoria.com |title=ReturnToAstoria.com |publisher=ReturnToAstoria.com |access-date=2009-07-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219183349/http://www.returntoastoria.com/ |archive-date=December 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuelindustries.com/casestudies/returntoastoria |title=Jeep presents ''The Goonies: Return To Astoria'' |publisher=Fuel Industries |access-date=2010-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110164130/http://www.fuelindustries.com/casestudies/returntoastoria |archive-date=2010-11-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA ''Goonies'' level pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' was released on May 9, 2017.
