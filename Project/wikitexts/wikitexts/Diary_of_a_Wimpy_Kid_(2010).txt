The film earned $75.7 million on a $15 million budget and was followed by three sequels: ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (2011 film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]'' (2011), ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days]]'' (2012), and ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'' (2017). An animated reboot was released to [[Disney+]] in 2021 titled ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2021 film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old [[Greg Heffley]] is apprehensive about beginning middle school. A week before school begins, his older brother Rodrick plays a trick on him at 4:00 in the morning, thinking he is late for school but soon wakes up his family and Rodrick gets off scot-free.  On his actual first day, he quickly discovers the ups and downs, such as the missing stall doors in the boys' bathroom and the difficulties of obtaining a seat during lunch. During P.E. class, Greg and his best friend, [[Rowley Jefferson]], escape from a game of Gladiator and learn from their friend, [[Chirag Gupta]], about a moldy piece of cheese on the basketball court that makes anyone who touches it an outcast and that the only way to get rid of what is known as \"the Cheese Touch\" is to pass it on to someone else. They also meet Angie Steadman, a 7th-grader photographer who isolates herself from the other students to \"survive\". Greg states his intention of becoming the most popular student in school by all it takes to land the Class Favorites page in the yearbook. He attempts to join the wrestling team, but soon suffers back-to-back humilation by a weird kid named Fregley and a former elementary school classmate named Patty Farrell who hated him for insulting her and Rowley ruins his chances of having being named Best Dressed by wearing the same thing a Greg (a shirt and tie).\n\nOn Halloween, while Greg and Rowley are out trick-or-treating, a group of teenage punks drive by in a pickup truck and spray a fire extinguisher at them. When Greg threatens to call the police, the punks chase him and Rowley to Greg's grandmother's house, but the latter two escape them after Greg accidentally damages the truck and ditches them in the Devil Worshiper Woods and makes it back home in time to only get dumped with water by Greg's dad Frank who mistakes them for teenagers because he is on the hunt for teens who try to toilet-paper the house\n\nThe boys join Safety Patrol and try out for a contest that offers a student a chance to become the new cartoonist for the school paper. Greg accidentally breaks Rowley's arm while throwing a football at Rowley's [[Big wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel]], making Rowley popular, and Rowley also wins the cartoonist contest. During a Safety Patrol assignment, Greg walks kindergartners home down a neighborhood street without Rowley (because he couldn't get his cast wet and Greg forgot his raincoat), but panics when he encounters a truck identical to the teenagers' from Halloween and hides the kids in a construction zone. After being spotted by a neighbor who mistakes him for Rowley, he abandons the kindergarteners and flees. To his bewilderment, Rowley is suspended from Safety Patrol, but Greg eventually confesses the truth. Distraught at Greg's mistreatment of him, Rowley ends their friendship. Greg is dismissed from Safety Patrol while Rowley is reinstated as captain. Greg is replaced by their classmate Collin as Rowley's best friend. Greg attempts to pursue popularity without Rowley, but all his efforts fail: he attemps to make friends with Fregley by having a sleepover with him but runs out in the middle of the night because of Fregley's sugar addiction (which Fregley was not supposed to eat), he tried to join the play [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] but Patty's bratty behavior because of her wanting to be Dorothy and causing him to get tackled by her when he refused to sing in front of Rodrick, and at the mother-son sweetheart dance (during which Greg tried to throw away the invitation but Rodrick found it and forced him to go), he tries to win back Rowley but fails and was shocked to see Rowley and his mother performing Beastie Boys' \"Intergalactic\". \n\nOne day at recess, Greg and Rowley loudly confront each other and a circle of students encourages them to fight; however, neither of them is good at fighting. The teenage boys from Halloween arrive at the scene and force Rowley to eat part of the cheese after the other kids, except for Greg, are chased inside the school. They flee the scene when the school's gym teacher, Coach Malone, arrives, but when the other kids come back out and notice that the cheese has been eaten, Greg takes the blame to save Rowley's reputation, mending their friendship. This, however, lands Greg with the Cheese Touch for holding the cheese in his hand. \n\nAt the end of the school year, Greg and Rowley make the yearbook Class Favorites page as \"Cutest Friends\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters}}\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as [[Greg Heffley]], a sixth grader who yearns to be popular.\n** Nathaniel Marten as adult Greg with Gordon providing the voice.\n** Dylan Bell as young Greg.\n** L.J.
