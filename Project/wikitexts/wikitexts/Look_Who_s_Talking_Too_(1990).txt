The film stars the original cast members [[John Travolta]] and [[Kirstie Alley]] as James and Mollie Ubriacco, the parents of Mikey (voiced by [[Bruce Willis]]), a toddler coping with the newest addition to the family, baby Julie (voiced by [[Roseanne Barr]]).\n\nIn addition to this, he is having trouble using a potty, and the unorthodox advice he gets from his playmate, Eddie (voiced by [[Damon Wayans]]), doesn't make his problem any better.<ref>{{cite news | title= 'Look Who's Talking Too' Needs a Diaper Change | work= LA Times | date=1990-12-14 | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-14/entertainment/ca-6596_1_star-talking-babies | accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Michael | last=Wilmington}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie picks up with the now married Mollie and James preparing for the birth of a new baby girl, while teaching Mikey how to use the potty. Meanwhile, James is working diligently to bring in more income for the family. Mikey looks forward to meeting his sibling as well as being a responsible big brother. When the baby is about to be born, her [[umbilical cord]] gets caught around her neck, putting her in distress. Given the name \"Julie\", she is born through a [[Cesarean section|c-section]] and is taken to the [[nursery (room)|nursery area]] for observation.\n\nWhen Julie meets Mikey, she is unimpressed. Mikey, on the other hand, quickly begins to resent his sister when his dreams of being a responsible big brother don't match the reality. Meanwhile, Mollie's slacker [[right-wing]] younger brother, Stuart comes to stay, to whom James takes an immediate dislike. This, combined with James being pressured into taking a demanding piloting job arranged by Mollie's parents and his belief that Mollie is too protective of Mikey, causes several arguments between the pair which eventually lead to James leaving. Mikey is upset about this and, believing he has left because of Julie, tears up one of his sister's stuffed animals. James occasionally hangs out with his kids (including scamming their way into a movie theater) and has fun with them. Following a burglary, Mollie's best friend Rona moves in with her and she soon starts dating Stuart.\n\nFollowing the 'death' of her beloved stuffed penguin (whom she named Herbie), Julie decides to learn to walk and leave. Later, Julie manages to walk to the [[sofa]] without support. Mollie sees this and is initially excited but then saddened that James isn't there to share the moment. As he watches Julie sleep one night, Mikey realizes how badly he's treated her and resolves to change his ways. Mollie decides to win James back and dresses sexy for him, but he isn't interested. As the two bicker, Mikey uses the toilet for the first time and calls his parents, who are immensely proud of him and share a happy moment.\n\nOne night as James prepares to fly, Mollie watches the news and learns that storms are all around the area. She goes to get James before he takes off, leaving Stuart with Mikey and Julie. She catches him and tries to persuade him not to take off, just as the control tower cancels the flight. The two then make up. Meanwhile, a burglar (presumably the same one who also robbed Rona) breaks in and runs when Stuart comes in with his unloaded gun. Stuart pursues him having forgotten about the kids and completely oblivious to the fact that he left paper on a hot stove which quickly causes a fire to start. Mikey doesn't panic and takes charge, pushing Julie out of the [[apartment]] to safety. Stuart and the burglar run into James who subdues the thief. Mollie and James soon find out the kids were left alone and spot the fire in the apartment, only for Mikey and Julie to emerge from the [[elevator]] as the two prepare to head in to save them. James then puts out the fire before it can cause too much damage.\n\nThe next day, James, Mollie, Stuart, Rona and Mollie's parents attend a barbecue. There, Julie asks Mikey why he saved her when they're always fighting. Mikey tells her that for as much as they get on each other's nerves, they're the kids and should stick together since the grown ups never make any sense to them. The two then walk off hand in hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as James Ubriacco/Voice of James' [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] (''uncredited'')\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as Mollie Ubriacco/Voice of Mollie's [[egg]] (''uncredited'')\n* Lorne Sussman as Mikey Ubriacco\n* Megan Milner as Julie Ubriacco (age 1 year)\n**Georgia Keithley as Julie (age 4 months)\n**Nikki Graham as Julie ([[fetus]]\u2013newborn) \n* Danny Pringle as Eddie\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Stuart Jensen\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Rona\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Rosie Jensen\n* Lesley Ewen as Debbie\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as Joey, the baby gym instructor\n* [[Don S. Davis]] as Dr. Fleischer\n\n'''Voices'''\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Mikey Ubriacco\n* [[Roseanne Barr]] as Julie Ubriacco\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as Eddie\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Mr. Toilet Man\n\n==Production==\nThe famous [[TriStar Pictures]] theme music, composed by [[Dave Grusin]], was played during the scene when Julie practices walking. A variation exists at the beginning of the logo when [[Bruce Willis]] (voice of Mikey) was doing a [[Mister Ed]] imitation.\n\n==Casting==\nThe bum teaser at the end of the first film portrayed an uncredited [[Joan Rivers]], providing the voice of Julie. Due to scheduling conflicts, she declined the role.\n\nAlso in the early trailer, [[Richard Pryor]] was originally going to be the voice of Eddie.\n\nAlso appearing are [[Olympia Dukakis]], [[Elias Koteas]], and [[Gilbert Gottfried]]. Further [[voice actor|vocal talents]] include [[Damon Wayans]] in a supporting role as the voice of Eddie. [[Mel Brooks]] makes a cameo appearance as the voice of Mr. Toilet Man. The film was followed by another sequel, ''[[Look Who's Talking Now]]'', in 1993.\n\n==Alternative versions==\nWhen the film aired on [[ABC Family]], many of its [[deleted scene]]s (such as Mollie threatening Mikey with corporal punishment if he takes Julie away again (Kirstie Alley reportedly hated saying that because she is an advocate against corporal punishment){{citation needed|date=June 2022}} were shown. One notable addition is a running gag where Mollie chats with her friends and folks and it ignites a daydream of James cheating on her. There is even one sequence where she imagines him as [[John Lennon]] and herself as [[Yoko Ono]] parodying their activism.\n\nIn one version, James and Stuart have a conversation after he arrives in the apartment.\n\n==Reception==\nUnlike its [[Look Who's Talking|predecessor]], it received mostly negative reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a score of 13% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 3.07/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|look_whos_talking_too|Look Who's Talking Too}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on March 22, 1991, and reached number 2 in the country's box office that weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/box-office.php?chart=19910322&movie=look_whos_talking_too|title=UK Weekend Box Office 22nd March 1991 - 24th March 1991|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2020}}</ref>\n \nIt grossed $47,789,074 at the box office in the United States and Canada,<ref>{{mojo title|lookwhostalkingtoo|Look Who's Talking Too}}</ref>  and $73.1 million internationally,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=June 26, 1992|last=Evan Frook|first=John|title=Col TriStar tide rising overseas|page=1}}</ref> for a worldwide total of $120.9 million.\n\nIt was also nominated for two [[Razzie Awards]], including Worst Supporting Actor for [[Gilbert Gottfried]] and Worst Supporting Actress for [[Roseanne Barr]], and a [[Stinkers Bad Movie Award]] for Worst Picture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0100050|Look Who's Talking Too}}\n* {{allrovi movie|29986|Look Who's Talking Too}}\n* {{mojo title|lookwhostalkingtoo|Look Who's Talking Too}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|look_whos_talking_too|Look Who's Talking Too}}\n\n{{The Look Who's Talking Trilogy}}\n{{Amy Heckerling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Look Who's Talking Too}}\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:American pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about babies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Amy Heckerling]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Kitay]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Amy Heckerling]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Neal Israel]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
