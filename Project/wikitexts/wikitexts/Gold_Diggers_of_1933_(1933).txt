It stars [[Warren William]], [[Joan Blondell]], [[Aline MacMahon]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and [[Dick Powell]], and features [[Guy Kibbee]], [[Ned Sparks]] and [[Ginger Rogers]].\n\nThe story is based on the play ''The Gold Diggers'' by [[Avery Hopwood]], which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920.<ref>IBDB [http://ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=6692 \"The Gold Diggers\"]</ref>  The play was made into a silent film in 1923 by [[David Belasco]], the producer of the Broadway play, as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', starring [[Hope Hampton]] and [[Wyndham Standing]], and again as a talkie in 1929, directed by [[Roy Del Ruth]]. That film, ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'', which starred [[Nancy Welford]] and [[Conway Tearle]], was one of the biggest box office hits of that year, and ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' was one of the top-grossing films of 1933.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3463&category=Notes Notes]</ref>  This version of Hopwood's play was written by James Seymour and Erwin S.

It begins with a rehearsal for a stage show, which is interrupted by the producer's [[creditor]]s who close down the show because of unpaid bills.\n\nAt the unglamorous apartment shared by three of the four actresses (Polly, Carol, and Trixie), the producer, Barney Hopkins ([[Ned Sparks]]), is in despair because he has everything he needs to put on a show, except money. He hears Brad Roberts ([[Dick Powell]]), the girls' neighbor and Polly's boyfriend, playing the piano. Brad is a brilliant songwriter and singer who not only has written the music for a show, but also offers Hopkins $15,000 in cash to back the production. Of course, they all think he is kidding, but he insists that he is serious &ndash; he offers to back the show, but refuses to perform in it, despite his talent and voice.\n\nBrad comes through with the money and the show goes into production, but the girls are suspicious that he must be a criminal since he is cagey about his past and will not appear in the show, even though he is clearly more talented than the aging juvenile lead (Clarence Nordstrom) they have hired. It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile cannot perform (due to his [[lumbago]] acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role.\n\nWith the resulting publicity, Brad's brother J. Lawrence Bradford ([[Warren William]]) and family lawyer Faneuil H. Peabody ([[Guy Kibbee]]) discover what he is doing and go to New York to save him from being seduced by a \"gold digger\".\n\nLawrence mistakenly identifies Carol as Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the \"cheap and vulgar\" showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that Carol plays along, but the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Trixie targets \"Fanny\" the lawyer as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. When Lawrence finds out that Brad and the real Polly have wed, he threatens to have the marriage annulled, but relents when Carol refuses to marry him if he does. Trixie marries Faneuil. All the \"gold diggers\" (except Fay) end up with wealthy men.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

It includes a [[tap dance]] from Keeler and a surreal sequence featuring [[dwarfism|dwarf]] actor Billy Barty as a baby who escapes from his stroller.  During the number, the women get caught in a rainstorm and go behind a backlit screen to remove their wet clothes in silhouette. They emerge in metal garments, which thwart the men's attempts to remove them, until Billy Barty gives Dick Powell a can opener.  This number was originally planned to end the film.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\n\"The Shadow Waltz\" is sung by Powell and Keeler. It features a dance by Keeler, Rogers, and many female violinists with neon-tubed violins that glow in the dark.  Berkeley got the idea for this number from a vaudeville act he once saw \u2013 the neon on the violins was an afterthought. On March 10, the [[Long Beach earthquake of 1933|Long Beach earthquake]] hit while this number was being filmed:\n\n<blockquote>[it] caused a blackout and short-circuited some of the dancing violins. Berkeley was almost thrown from the camera boom, dangling by one hand until he could pull himself back up. He yelled for the girls, many of whom were on a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}}-high platform, to sit down until technicians could get the soundstage doors open and let in some light.<ref name=tcmarticle>Frank Miller [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3463&category=Articles \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" TCM article]</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Remember My Forgotten Man\" is performed by Joan Blondell, with featured vocal solo by [[Etta Moten]] &ndash; who also dubbed Blondell's singing voice at the end of the number<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|3947}}</ref> &ndash; and features sets influenced by [[German Expressionism]] and a gritty evocation of Depression-era poverty. Berkeley was inspired by the May [[Bonus Army|1932 war veterans' march]] on Washington, D.C. and FDR's [[Forgotten man|speech about the \"Forgotten Man\"]] from the same year.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=<!--not listed--> |date=2006 |title=Gold Diggers of 1933 |medium=DVD |chapter=FDR's New Deal ...

Vieira, ''Gold Diggers of 1933'' was one of the first American films made and distributed with alternative footage in order to circumvent [[Film censorship in the United States|state censorship]] problems. Busby Berkeley, the choreographer and director of the musical numbers, used the lavish production numbers as a showcase of the female anatomy that were both \"lyrical and lewd\".<ref name=\"Sin\">{{cite book |last1=Vieira |first1=Mark A. |title=Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood |year=1999 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York |isbn=978-0-8109-4475-6 |page=117}}</ref> \"Pettin' in the Park\" and \"We're in the Money\" are prime examples of this. The state censorship boards had become so troublesome that a number of studios began filming slightly different versions of censorable scenes. In this way, when a film was edited, the \"toned down\" reels were labeled according to district. One version could be sent to New York City, another to the [[Southern United States|South]], and another to the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Sin\" />\n\nVieira reports that the film had two different endings: in one, the rocky romance between Warren William and Joan Blondell &ndash; whom he calls \"cheap and vulgar\" &ndash; is resolved backstage after the \"Forgotten Man\" number. In an alternative ending, this scene never takes place and the film ends with the number.<ref name=\"Sin\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{commons category}}}}\n*{{AFI film|3947}}\n*{{IMDb title|0024069}}\n*{{tcmdb title|3463}}\n*{{Amg movie|20140}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=gold_diggers_of_1933|title=Gold Diggers of 1933}}\n*''Gold Diggers of 1933'' essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pages 210-211 [https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_s_Film_Legacy_2009_2010/4GNRD_icEmkC?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ88np0JHsAhUvlXIEHdpMAUYQiKUDMBd6BAgGEAQ]\n\n{{The Gold Diggers}}\n{{Busby Berkeley}}\n{{Mervyn LeRoy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gold Diggers Of 1933}}\n[[Category:1933 films]]\n[[Category:1933 musical films]]\n[[Category:Great Depression films]]\n[[Category:American musical films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films about musical theatre]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mervyn LeRoy]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Lord (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
