Directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]] and written by [[Lawrence Edward Watkin]], the film stars [[Albert Sharpe]] as O'Gill alongside [[Janet Munro]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Jimmy O'Dea]].\n\n==Plot==\nDarby O'Gill and his daughter, Katie, live in Rathcullen, a small [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] town, where Darby is the caretaker for Lord Fitzpatrick's estate. Darby continually tries to catch a tribe of leprechauns, particularly their king, Brian Connors.\n\nLord Fitzpatrick retires Darby, replacing him with a young Dubliner named Michael McBride. Darby begs Michael not to tell Katie he has been replaced, and he reluctantly agrees. While chasing Fitzpatrick's horse, Cleopatra, which is actually a ''[[pooka]]'', Darby is captured by Brian and the leprechauns and taken to their mountain lair, Knocknasheega. Brian has brought Darby there to prevent Katie from learning he lost his job. Darby cannot leave Knocknasheega as a consequence.\n\nDarby tricks the leprechauns into opening the mountain and leaving by playing \"The Fox Chase\" on Brian's [[Stradivarius]] violin. Darby escapes, and expecting Brian to pursue him, later engages him in a drinking game with a jug of ''[[poit\u00edn]]'', allowing him to capture the leprechaun at sunrise, when his magic has no effect. Since Darby has caught him, Brian grants him three wishes, but warns that wishing for a fourth forfeits them all. Darby's first wish is for Brian to stay by his side for two weeks or until Darby runs out of wishes. Brian tricks Darby into using his second wish to draw Katie and Michael closer together.\n\nPony Sugrue, the town bully, decides to try to take Michael's new job and Katie for himself. Pony's mother, Sheelah, tells Katie about Darby's retirement, causing Katie to angrily confront Darby and Michael. When Cleopatra has gotten loose again, Katie chases her to Knocknasheega. Darby later finds her stricken with a deadly fever. A [[banshee]] appears and summons the [[Dullahan]] on a [[Death Coach|death coach]] to transport Katie's soul. Brian sadly grants Darby's third wish to take Katie's place. Inside the death coach, Brian consoles Darby, then tricks him into wishing he would have Brian's company in the afterlife. This counts as a fourth wish and Brian voids all his others. Darby is freed from the death coach and returns to Katie, who makes a full recovery. Michael later confronts and humiliates Pony at the pub. Michael and Katie fall in love with Darby's approval.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Albert Sharpe]] as Darby O'Gill\n* [[Janet Munro]] as Katie O'Gill\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Michael McBride\n* [[Jimmy O'Dea]] as King Brian\n* [[Kieron Moore]] as Pony Sugrue\n* [[Estelle Winwood]] as Widow Sheelah Sugrue\n* [[Walter Fitzgerald]] as Lord Fitzpatrick\n* [[Denis O'Dea]] as Father Murphy\n* [[J.
