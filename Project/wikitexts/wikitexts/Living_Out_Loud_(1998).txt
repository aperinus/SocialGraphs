But after she puts her studies on hold to find a job and support them, many years pass until suddenly he leaves Judith to be with another doctor. Depressed, she holes up in her apartment, where the middle-aged Pat Francato serves as a building superintendent and elevator operator. He is as lonely as she is, beset with gambling problems, and Judith and Pat make a connection. Yet what he wishes to pursue as a romantic relationship, Judith sees only as a friendship. Her friend Liz Bailey, who sings at a nightclub, makes attempts to improve Judith's love life as well as her own.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Judith Moore\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Pat Francato\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Liz Bailey\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Robert Nelson\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as The Kisser\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Philly Francato\n* [[Mariangela Pino]] as Donna\n* [[Suzanne Shepherd]] as Mary\n* [[Eddie Cibrian]] as The Masseur\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Mrs. Nelson\n\n==Reception==\n''Living Out Loud'' received mixed reviews from critics.
