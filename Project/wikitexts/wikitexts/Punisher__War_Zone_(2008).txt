''Punisher: War Zone'' was released in North America by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] on December 5, 2008, and it was released in the United Kingdom by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] on February 6, 2009 to negative reviews and grossed $10 million worldwide, making it a [[box-office bomb|commercial failure]]. Its related soundtrack hit the #23 slot on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard's]]'' [[Top Independent Albums]] chart.\n\nIt was the final ''Punisher'' film to be produced by an outside studio before the rights reverted to [[Marvel Studios]], with Stevenson reprising his role as Castle in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''. A [[The Punisher (TV series)|television series]] was later released on [[Netflix]] in 2017 and is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Plot {{anchor|Synopsis}}==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be 400 to 700 words. -->\nHaving lost his family to mob violence, former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Marine Frank Castle has spent the last five years as a [[vigilante]] known as the [[Punisher]]. Castle assaults a party for local [[American Mafia|Don]] Gaitano Cesare, and kills him and the guests. Cesare's ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Billy \"The Beaut\" Russotti]] escapes to his recycling plant hideout, and Detectives [[Martin Soap]] and Saffiotti, who were staking out the party, inform Castle. Castle infiltrates Russoti's hideout, and after a brief firefight, Russoti is thrown into a glass-crushing machine that leaves him hideously disfigured. Russoti later refers to himself as \"[[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]\" because the stitches in his face resemble puzzle pieces. Castle, who takes cover behind the body of Nicky Donatelli, discovers that Donatelli was actually an undercover [[FBI]] agent.\n\nAgent [[Paul Budiansky]], the deceased agent's partner, joins the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s \"Punisher Task Force\", partnering with Soap to help bring Castle to justice. Meanwhile, Jigsaw frees his deranged and [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] brother, \"[[Psychiatric hospital|Loony Bin]] Jim\".\n\nDistraught over killing the agent, Castle unsuccessfully attempts to make reparations to Donatelli's wife, Angela, and daughter, Grace. Castle threatens to retire from the vigilante business, but his armorer [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] makes him reconsider, telling him that Jigsaw will go after Donatelli's family for revenge.\n\nJigsaw, Loony Bin Jim and their two henchmen, Ink and Pittsy, break into Donatelli's house and hold the family hostage. The Punisher tracks down Maginty, a known associate of Jigsaw, executing him after extracting the information before Budiansky and Soap apprehend him. Castle tells him that Jigsaw went after Donatelli's family, and Budiansky sends a police car to check on the Donatelli residence, intending to turn the Punisher in. When the patrol car fails to respond, Budiansky checks on the house, where Ink and Pittsy capture him. Soap frees the Punisher, who kills both Ink and Pittsy before leading Angela and Grace away. Budiansky then arrests Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim after a short gunfight.\n\nJigsaw and his brother bargain with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for their release by giving up Cristu Bulat, who was smuggling in a biological weapon destined for Arab terrorists in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]]. The brothers are granted immunity, plus the [[US$]]12 million Bulat was paying to use Jigsaw's port, and a file on Micro. They take Micro hostage, killing his mother in the process. They once again take the Donatellis hostage, after critically injuring Micro's associate Carlos, whom Castle had left to protect them. Castle later arrives at the hideout, and [[Coup de gr\u00e2ce|euthanizes]] Carlos. Jigsaw sets himself up in the Bradstreet Hotel, putting together a small army of gangsters desiring vengeance against the Punisher. Castle enlists the help of Budiansky, who informs Cristu's father, Tiberiu Bulat, about Jigsaw's location. Tiberiu's enforcers start a shootout in the hotel lobby, affording Castle a distraction.\n\nCastle enters through a second-floor window, leading to a firefight with Jigsaw's hired guns. Afterward, Castle engages Loony Bin Jim in solo combat; realizing that he will probably not survive the brawl, Jim flees. Castle chases and confronts both him and Jigsaw, who are holding Micro and Grace at gunpoint. Jigsaw gives Castle a choice: If Frank shoots Micro, Jigsaw will let the others go free. Micro bravely offers his life to save the girl, but Castle chooses to shoot Loony Bin Jim instead. As a result, Jigsaw kills Micro. Enraged that his partner died, Castle attacks Jigsaw, eventually impaling him with a metal rod and throwing him onto a fire. As Jigsaw burns to death, Castle calmly tells him, \"[[Hell|This is just the beginning]].\" Outside, Angela forgives Castle, who bids farewell to Budiansky and the Donatelli family. As Castle and Soap leave together, Soap tries to convince Castle to give up his vigilante status after having \"killed every criminal in town.\" Soap changes his mind when he is held up by a murderous mugger, who quickly becomes another victim of the Punisher.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle / The Punisher]]: Prior to filming, Stevenson read every possible issue of the ''[[The Punisher: Frank Castle|Punisher MAX]]'' series, underwent endurance, martial arts, and weapons training with former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon Marines]] and film fight choreographer Pat Johnson.<ref name=\"collider-interview\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/10042/tcid/1 | title=Interview: Ray Stevenson on ''Punisher: War Zone'' | work=Collider.com | date=December 4, 2008 | access-date=2009-09-18}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp?aid=11258&tcid=1 | title=Ray Stevenson talks ''Punisher'' | work=Collider.com | date=March 15, 2009 | access-date=2009-09-18}}</ref>\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Microchip (comics)|Linus Lieberman / Microchip]]: Armorer to the Punisher.\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as FBI Agent Paul Budiansky: Former partner of Nicky Donatelli.
