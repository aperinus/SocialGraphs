It stars [[JoBeth Williams]], [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Beatrice Straight]], and was produced by Spielberg and [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]]. The film focuses on a suburban family whose home is invaded by [[malevolent ghosts]] that abduct their youngest daughter.\n\nAs Spielberg was contractually unable to direct another film while he made ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]],'' Hooper was selected based on his work on ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse]]''. Spielberg conceived ''Poltergeist'' as a horror sequel to his 1977 film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' titled ''[[Night Skies]]''; however, Hooper was less interested in the sci-fi elements and suggested they collaborate on a [[ghost story]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S|title=Fangoria #23, Article \"Tobe Hooper on Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Poltergeist\"|last=Martin|first=Bob|year=1982|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_023_c2c_1982_Evil_Dead_scan_by_SproutHatesWatermarks_S/page/n27 28]}}</ref> Accounts differ as to the level of Spielberg's involvement, but it is clear that he was frequently on set during filming and exerted significant creative control. For that reason, some have expressed the view that Spielberg should be considered the film's co-director or even main director, though both Spielberg and Hooper have disputed this.\n\nReleased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 4, 1982, ''Poltergeist'' was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the [[1982 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of 1982]]. Years since its release, the film has been recognized as a horror classic. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], named by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association]] as the 20th-scariest film ever made, and the scene of the clown doll attack was ranked as No. 80 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]].''<ref>{{cite web |title=Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments |url=https://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |access-date=May 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030070540/http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Scariest_Movie_Moments/index.shtml |archive-date=October 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chicago Critics' Scariest Films|url=https://www.altfg.com/film/chicago-critics-scariest-films/ |publisher=AltFilmGuide.com |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> The film also appeared at No. 84 on [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills|100 Years...100 Thrills]], a list of America's most heart-pounding movies.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills |url=https://www.afi.com/Docs/tvevents/pdf/thrills100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> It was followed by ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]'' (1986), ''[[Poltergeist III]]'' (1988), and a [[Poltergeist (2015 film)|2015 remake]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSteven and Diane Freeling live in Cuesta Verde, a California [[planned community]]. Steven is a successful real estate agent, and Diane looks after their three children: sixteen-year-old Dana, eight-year-old Robbie, and five-year-old Carol Anne. Late one night, Carol Anne inexplicably converses with the family's television set while it displays post-broadcast [[Noise (video)|static]]. The next night, she again fixates on the TV, and a ghostly white hand emerges from the screen, followed by a violent earthquake. As the family awakens from the quake, Carol Anne eerily declares \"They're here.\"\n\nBizarre events occur the following day: a glass of milk spontaneously breaks, [[Spoon bending|silverware bends]], and furniture moves on its own. These phenomena initially seem benign, but soon grow more sinister. During a severe thunderstorm, the gnarled backyard tree seemingly comes alive. A large limb crashes through the children's bedroom window and grabs Robbie, and attempts to devour him. While the family rushes outside to rescue Robbie, Carol Anne is drawn into a portal inside the closet. After saving Robbie from the tree, which got sucked into a tornado, the family frantically search for Carol Anne, only for her voice to call out from the TV.\n\n[[parapsychology|Parapsychologist]] Dr. Martha Lesh arrives with team members Ryan and Marty to investigate. They determine there is a [[poltergeist]] intrusion involving multiple ghosts. Meanwhile, Steven learns from his boss, Mr. Lewis Teague, that the Cuesta Verde development was built on a former cemetery and the graves were moved to a nearby location.\n\nDana and Robbie are sent away for safety, while Dr. Lesh calls in Tangina Barrons, [[mediumship|a spiritual medium]]. Tangina determines the spirits are lingering in a different \"sphere of consciousness\" and are not at rest. They are attracted to Carol Anne's life force. Tangina also detects a dark presence she calls the \"Beast,\" who is restraining Carol Anne and manipulating her life force in order to prevent the other spirits from crossing over.\n\nThe entrance to the other dimension is in the children's bedroom closet and exits through the living room ceiling. Diane, secured by a rope, passes through the portal, guided by another rope previously threaded through both portals. Diane retrieves Carol Anne, and they drop through the ceiling to the living room floor, covered in [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]. As they recover from the ordeal, Tangina proclaims the house is \"clean.\"\n\nShortly after, the Freeling family have nearly finished packing to move out of the house. Before the family is to leave for the [[Holiday Inn]], Steven goes to his office while Dana is on a date, leaving Diane at home with Robbie and Carol Anne. The \"Beast\" ambushes Diane and the children, aiming for a second kidnapping attempt. The unseen force drives Diane to the backyard in the pouring rain, dragging her into the flooded swimming pool [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Skeletal corpses and coffins float up around her in the muddy hole. Diane crawls out and rushes back into the house. She rescues the children, and they escape to the outside as more coffins and bodies erupt from the ground.\n\nSteven, accompanied by Teague, arrives home to the mayhem and realizes that only the gravestones were relocated; the development was built over the abandoned bodies. The Freelings jump into their car and collect Dana just as she returns home. They flee Cuesta Verde as the house implodes into the portal while stunned neighbors look on. The family checks into their room at a [[Holiday Inn]], where Steven promptly rips out the TV and shoves it outside.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Diane Freeling\n* [[Craig T.

After screening them ''[[A Guy Named Joe]]'' and saying he wanted to remake that film \u2013 which he would in 1989's ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'' \u2013 Spielberg also mentioned that he had thought of a ghost story and intended to turn it into a script.

There were suggestions that Spielberg, in addition to being ''Poltergeist'''s co-producer and co-writer, had also served as its de facto co-director. This view was bolstered by various statements Spielberg made about his involvement, including a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' quote on May 24, 1982: \"Tobe isn't ... a take-charge sort of guy. If a question was asked and an answer wasn't immediately forthcoming, I'd jump in and say what we could do. Tobe would nod agreement, and that became the process of collaboration.\"<ref name=\"Brode102\">Brode, pg 102</ref>\n\nThat same article noted that the [[Directors Guild of America]] had \"opened an investigation into the question of whether or not Hooper's official credit was being denigrated by statements Spielberg has made, apparently claiming authorship.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pollack |first1=Dale |title='Poltergeist': Whose Film Is It? |agency=Los Angeles Times |date=May 24, 1982}}</ref> The investigation ended in an arbitrator's ruling that \"MGM/UA Entertainment Co. must pay $15,000 to director Tobe Hooper because the studio gave producer Steven Spielberg a bigger credit than Hooper got in its trailers,\" although also noting that \"broader issues of dispute exist between producer-writer (Spielberg) and the director\" (original damages of $200,000 were originally sought by the DGA).<ref>{{cite news |last=Searles |first=Jack |title=Hooper gets some recognition |agency=Los Angeles Herald Examiner |date=1982-06-19}}</ref> Co-producer [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] told the ''LA Times'' that \"the creative force of the movie was Steven. Tobe was the director and was on the set every day. But Steven did the design for every storyboard and he was on the set every day except for three days when he was in Hawaii with [[George Lucas|Lucas]].\" However, Hooper stated that he \"did fully half of the storyboards.\"<ref name=\"Brode101\"/>\n\nThe week of the film's release, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' printed an [[open letter]] to Hooper from Spielberg.\n\n<blockquote>Regrettably, some of the press has misunderstood the rather unique, creative relationship which you and I shared throughout the making of ''Poltergeist''.\nI enjoyed your openness in allowing me, as a writer and a producer, a wide berth for creative involvement, just as I know you were happy with the freedom you had to direct ''Poltergeist'' so wonderfully.\nThrough the screenplay you accepted a vision of this very intense movie from the start, and as the director, you delivered the goods. You performed responsibly and professionally throughout, and I wish you great success on your next project.<ref name=\"Brode99\">Brode, pg 99\u2013100</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' interview, [[Zelda Rubinstein]] discussed her recollections of the shooting process. She said \"Steven directed all six days\" she was on set: \"Tobe set up the shots and Steven made the adjustments.\" She also alleged that Hooper \"allowed some unacceptable chemical agents into his work,\" and that during her audition, \"Tobe was only partially there.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Click over, children!

In response to the magazine's query about the authorship issue, cast members unanimously sided with Hooper. James Karen said, \"Tobe had a hard time on that film. It's tough when a producer is on set every day and there's always been a lot of talk about that. I considered Tobe my director. That's my stand on all those rumours.\" Martin Casella stated: \"So much of ''Poltergeist'' looks and feels like a Spielberg movie but my recollection is that Tobe was mostly directing.\" Oliver Robins: \"The guy who sets up the shots, blocks the actors and works with the crew to create a vision is the director. In those terms, Tobe was the director. He's the one who directed me, anyway.\" Make-up and effects artist Craig Reardon said Spielberg often had the final say. The original version of the cancerous steak, for instance, was created by Reardon per Hooper's specifications\u2014but vetoed by Spielberg: \"Although the first steak did not represent a killing amount of work, it had consumed enough time and effort\u2014none of which I could afford to waste\u2014that I determined in the future to make certain whatever I prepped would be approved in advance by Spielberg as well as Hooper.\"<ref name=\"ruemorge121\" />\n\nHooper was asked about the controversy in a 2015 interview with online journal ''Film Talk'' and said the rumors originated from a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article which reported on Spielberg shooting footage of \"little race cars\" in front of the house while Hooper was busy elsewhere shooting another scene. \"From there it became its own legend. That is how I remember it; I was making the movie and later on, I heard this stuff after it was finished. I really can\u2019t set the record much straighter than that.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmtalk.org/2015/04/17/tobe-hooper-i-always-wanted-to-work-in-the-time-before-i-was-born/|title=Tobe Hooper: \"I always wanted to work in the time before I was born\"|date=April 17, 2015|publisher=Film Talk|access-date=September 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310221935/https://filmtalk.org/2015/04/17/tobe-hooper-i-always-wanted-to-work-in-the-time-before-i-was-born/|archive-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Blumhouse Productions]] website, first assistant cameraman [[John R. Leonetti]] reported that Spielberg directed the film more so than Hooper, stating, \"Hooper was so nice and just happy to be there. He creatively had input. Steven developed the movie, and it was his to direct, except there was anticipation of a director's strike, so he was 'the producer' but really he directed it in case there was going to be a strike and Tobe was cool with that. It wasn't anything against Tobe. Every once in a while, he would actually leave the set and let Tobe do a few things just because. But really, Steven directed it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blumhouse.com/2017/07/14/confirmation-who-really-directed-poltergeist/|title=Confirmation?

Tobe had been deeply involved in all of the pre-production and everything. But Steven is a guy who will come in and call the shots. And so, you're on your first studio film, hired by Steven Spielberg, who is enthusiastically involved in this movie. Are you gonna say, 'Stop that... let me do this'? Which [Tobe] did.\n\n[...] Tobe was a terrific filmmaker. I don't think it's that Steven was controlling. I think it was Steven was enthusiastic. And nobody was there to protect Tobe. But all of the pre-production was done by Tobe. Tobe was there throughout. Tobe's vision is very much realized there. And Tobe got credit because he deserved credit. Including... Steven Spielberg said that.\n\n[...] Yes, Steven Spielberg was very much involved.

The film won the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]] and earned a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], which it lost to Spielberg's other summer hit, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music for ''Poltergeist'' was written by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who recalled, \n\n{{cquote|Steven Spielberg called me about five months before [''Poltergeist''] went into production and wanted to know if I would be interested in doing it. He\u2019d long been an admirer of mine, and we had met several times. I said I\u2019d be very interested, so he sent me a script and I loved it. I was very excited about being involved with anything with Spielberg, anyway... With Spielberg, probably more than any other director, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of discussion. He\u2019s very articulate about music, and one can discuss for hours about approaches. Anything I did was not on my own volition; it was a joint effort in that we both agreed what we were trying to do with the music for the picture. We wanted a childlike theme for the little girl; Spielberg felt that much of the action in the closet should have a quasi-religious atmosphere to it. There was something definitely non-human about it, yet it was not evil all the way. It was discussing specifics like that which resulted in our approach... [Tobe Hooper] was not involved at all with post-production.

In 1999, a snap case edition with the same DVD disc, but a different cover was released by [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment|Warner Home Video]] after the pre-1986 MGM library was acquired by the [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]-owned [[Turner Entertainment]].

The re-release was billed as having digitally remastered picture and sound, and a two-part documentary: \"They Are Here: The Real World of Poltergeists\", which makes extensive use of clips from the film. The remastered DVD of the film was released as scheduled, but both high-definition releases were eventually canceled. Warner rescheduled the high-definition version of the film and eventually released it only on the Blu-ray format on October 14, 2008.<ref>[https://www.wbshop.com/products/poltergeist-bd ''Poltergeist'' on Blu-ray] at WBshop.com</ref>\n\n''Poltergeist'' was released by [[Warner Bros.

It was printed in the United States through Warner Books, with the first printing in May 1982.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=James |title=Poltergeist (9780446302227): James Kahn: Books |year=1982 |isbn=0446302228}}</ref> While the film focuses mainly on the Freeling family, much of the book leans toward the relationship between Tangina and Dr. Lesh away from the family. The novel also expands upon many scenes from the film, such as the nighttime manifestation of outer-dimensional entities of fire and shadows in the Freelings' living room, and an extended version of the kitchen scene in which Marty watches a steak crawl across a countertop. In the book, Marty is frozen in place and skeletonized by spiders and rats. There are also additional elements not in the film, such as Robbie's mysterious discovery of the clown doll in the yard during his birthday party, and a benevolent spirit, \"The Waiting Woman\", who protects Carol Anne in the spirit world.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Poltergeist'' was released theatrically by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on June 4, 1982.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Woofter|editor-first=Kristopher|title=American Twilight: The Cinema of Tobe Hooper|location=Austin, Tex.|publisher=University of Texas Press|date=2021|isbn=9781477322833|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIooEAAAQBAJ|page=329}}</ref> The film was a commercial success and earned $76,606,280 in the United States, making it the highest-grossing horror film of [[1982 in film|1982]] and eighth overall for the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl107709953/weekend/ |title=Box Office Information for ''Poltergeist'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film was well received by critics and is considered by many as a classic of the [[Horror film|horror genre]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/1016513-poltergeist/?page=2&critic=columns&sortby=date&name_order=desc&view=#contentReviews |title= ''Poltergeist'' Movie Reviews, Page 2 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/1016513-poltergeist/?page=3&critic=approved&sortby=date&name_order=desc&view=#contentReviews |title= ''Poltergeist'' Movie Reviews, Page 3 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> as well as one of the best films of 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmsite.org/1982.html |title=The Greatest Films of 1982 |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] [[Filmsite.org|FilmSite.org]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies/features/story/10-best-movies-of-1982/15287150/ |title=The 10 Best Movies of 1982 |publisher=[[RealNetworks|Film.com]] |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.films101.com/y1982r.htm |title= The Best Movies of 1982 by Rank |publisher=Films101.com |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 88% based on reviews from 72 critics, with an average rating of 7.40/10.

As the Beast, Kane went to extraordinary lengths to keep his \"flock\" under his control, even in death. The original motive of the cemetery's souls disturbed by the housing development was thereby altered; the cemetery was now explained to be built above a cave where Kane and his flock met their ends.  It also reveals that the women of the family are actually psychics.\n\n''[[Poltergeist III]]'' in 1988 finds Carol Anne as the sole original family member living in an elaborate Chicago skyscraper owned and inhabited by her aunt, uncle and cousin. Kane follows her there and uses the building's ubiquitous decorative mirrors as a portal to the Earthly plane.\n\nA remake of the original film was made by MGM and [[20th Century Fox]], directed by [[Gil Kenan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/06/mgm-fox-2000-to-co-finance-production-to-start-this-fall|title=MGM, Fox 2000 To Co-Finance & Distribute 'Poltergeist'; Production To Start This Fall|first=The Deadline|last=Team|date=June 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title='Poltergeist' Reboot Set For Late-Summer Start|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-set-for-late-summer-start-1200005032/|newspaper=Variety|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://collider.com/poltergeist-remake-filming-this-fall-release-2014/ | title = POLTERGEIST Remake Confirmed to Shoot This Fall; Likely Due out Next Year | first = Matt | last = Goldberg | date = June 20, 2013 | access-date = 2013-06-20 | publisher = Collider.com }}</ref> [[Sam Raimi]], [[Rob Tapert]], and [[Roy Lee]] produced the film, which stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Jared Harris]], and [[Rosemarie DeWitt]].<ref name=\"R\"/> ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]'' was released on May 22, 2015.<ref name=\"R\">{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/poltergeist-reboot-release-date-spy-release-date-melissa-mccarthy-1201447391/|title='Poltergeist' Reboot Moved Up to May 22, 'Spy' Back to June 5|author=Dave McNary|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 5, 2015|access-date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 10, 2019, it was announced that the [[Russo brothers|Russo Brothers]] would helm a new remake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3555052/poltergeist-getting-remade-captain-america-avengers-directors/|title='Poltergeist' Getting Remade *Again* with 'Captain America' and 'Avengers' Directors?!|first=Brad|last=Miska|date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe song \"Shining\" by [[horror punk]] band [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], on their 1997 album ''[[American Psycho (album)|American Psycho]]'', is based directly on the film, with the chorus centered on the refrain: \"Carol Anne, Carol Anne\".<ref>Greene, James R.
