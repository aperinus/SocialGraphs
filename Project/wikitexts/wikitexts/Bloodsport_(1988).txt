The film centers on [[Frank Dux]] (Van Damme), a [[United States Army]] Captain and [[ninjitsu]] practitioner, who competes in an underground, full-contact martial arts tournament called the Kumite in [[Hong Kong]]. It was one of Van Damme's first starring films and showcased his athletic abilities, launching his career as a mainstream action star.\n\nThe screenplay is based on many of Dux's claims first covered in the November 1980 issue of [[Black Belt (magazine)|''Black Belt'' magazine]].<ref name=\"stewart\">{{cite web|last=John|first=Stewart|date=November 1980|title=Kumite: A Learning Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126164220/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JtIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29|archive-date=January 26, 2019|work=Black Belt|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|pages=28\u201334}}</ref> The real Dux served as the film's action choreographer and technical advisor.

Despite mixed reviews from critics, it was a considerable box office success, grossing $50&nbsp;million on a budget of $1.5\u20132.3&nbsp;million. It developed a strong [[cult following]], and has been cited as an influence on the development of [[mixed martial arts]]. It spawned three [[direct-to-video]] sequels.\n\n==Plot==\n[[U.S. Army Captain]] Frank Dux has trained in the ways of [[ninjutsu]] under his [[sensei]] Senzo Tanaka. As a boy, Dux and a group of his friends broke into Tanaka's home to steal a [[katana]], but Dux was apprehended while returning the katana to its place. Impressed by Dux's integrity and toughness, Senzo decided to train him alongside his son, Shingo. After Shingo's death, Senzo trains Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. Dux is invited to the Kumite, an illegal martial arts tournament in Hong Kong. After his Army superiors refuse to let him go, Dux goes [[absent without leave]], says goodbye to his sensei and leaves for Hong Kong. Two [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Command]] agents, Helmer and Rawlins, are assigned to track down and arrest Dux.\n\nAfter arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American fighter Ray Jackson and their guide Victor Lin. When they arrive at the Kumite arena, the officials are skeptical but eventually accept them after Dux proves his connection to the Tanaka clan by performing the [[Touch of Death|Dim Mak]] death touch. On the first day of the tournament, Dux earns the enmity of the ruthless Kumite champion Chong Li after breaking his record for the fastest knockout.\n\nDux becomes involved with American journalist Janice Kent, who is investigating the Kumite. Although Dux refuses to help her, she sneaks into the arena by agreeing to a date with another spectator. On the second day, Jackson is matched against Chong Li. Although Jackson comes close to defeating Li, he wastes time gloating, allowing Li to recover and brutally beat him. Dux visits Jackson in the hospital and vows to avenge him. After witnessing the brutality of the tournament, Kent argues with Dux and tries to convince him not to return. Dux tells her that he has to win in order to become the best he can be.\n\nHelmer and Rawlins arrive in Hong Kong and contact [[Hong Kong Police Force|local police inspector]] Chen. They begin asking around for Dux and track him down to his hotel. A chase through the downtown ensues but Dux evades them when they fall into a canal. When Dux arrives at the Kumite, Helmer and Rawlins are waiting for him, along with Chen and four of his officers. Dux defeats them, but agrees to return with Helmer and Rawlins after the tournament.\n\nOn the final day, Li kills his semifinal opponent, much to the consternation of the crowd. Fearing defeat, Li conceals a salt pill in his waistband before the final match against Dux. When Dux gains the upper hand, Li blinds him by crushing the pill and throwing it into Dux's face. Dux falls back on his training from Tanaka, who taught him to fight blindfolded, overcoming the handicap and defeating Li. The next day, he bids farewell to Kent and Jackson before returning to the United States with Helmer and Rawlins.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as [[Frank Dux]]\n**Pierre Rafini as young Frank\n* [[Donald Gibb]] as Ray Jackson\n* [[Leah Ayres]] as Janice Kent\n* [[Norman Burton]] as [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] Agent Helmer\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] Agent Rawlins\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Chong Li\n*Ken Siu as Victor Lin\n* [[Roy Chiao]] as Senzo Tanaka\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as Captain Chen\n*Bernard Mariano as Hossein\n*[[Lily Leung]] as Mrs. Tanaka\n*Sean Ward as Shingo Tanaka\n*Kimo Lai Kwok Ki as Hiro\n*Bill Yuen Ping Kuen as Oshima\n*Paulo Tocha as Paco\n*[[Cihangir Ghaffari]] as Gustafson\n*John Cheung as Toon\n*Dennis Chiu as Chuan\n*[[Michel Qissi]] as Suan Parades\n*David Ho as Pumola\n*Eric Neff as Morra\n*Michael Chan as Yasuda\n*Rick Erikson as Coutard\n*John Law as Luu\n*Samson Li as Prang\n*Ken Boyle as Colonel Cooke\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Writing ===\nCo-writer [[Sheldon Lettich]] came up with the idea for the film. According to Lettich:\n\n<blockquote>\"I had known Frank Dux for a number of months before I came up with the idea for ''Bloodsport''. Frank told me a lot of tall tales, most of which turned out to be bullshit. But his stories about participating in this so-called \"Kumite\" event sounded like a great idea for a movie. There was one guy who he introduced me to, named Richard Bender, who claimed to have actually been at the Kumite event and who swore everything Frank told me was true. A few years later this guy had a falling-out with Frank, and confessed to me that everything he told me about the Kumite was a lie; Frank had coached him in what to say.\"<ref name=\"asian movie pulse\">{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Brian|title=Q & A with Sheldon Lettich By Marco A.

The film plays the song \"Steal the Night\" by [[Michael Bishop (bassist)|Michael Bishop]] during a scene where Dux runs from Helmer and Rawlins. The song was released in the mid-2000s as a single containing a vocal and instrumental version.
