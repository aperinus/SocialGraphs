The film, which stars [[Gina Gershon]], [[Drea de Matteo]], [[Lori Petty]], [[Shelly Cole]], and [[Marc Blucas]], follows the story of Jacki and her all-girl [[punk rock]] band, Clam Dandy. The film is adapted from a semi-autobiographical play of the same name by Lovedog, who founded an LA [[Punk rock|punk]] band in the 1980s.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2003 Sundance Film Festival]] and was given a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] on October 3, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nJacki, the frontwoman for Clam Dandy, an all-girl [[punk rock]] band in Los Angeles, is on the verge of turning forty. The band, which includes bassist Tracy, lead guitarist Faith, and drummer Sally, has been scraping by for over a decade without managing to land a good record deal. Jacki must decide if she wants to keep plugging away at dreams of stardom, or to throw in the towel and devote herself full-time to the tattoo parlor where she works. Along the way, the women are rocked by personal tragedies that threaten to break up the band before they can get their last shot at success.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Gina Gershon]] as Jacki\n*[[Drea de Matteo]] as Tracy\n*[[Lori Petty]] as Faith\n*[[Shelly Cole]] as Sally\n*[[Marc Blucas]] as Animal\n*[[Ashley Eckstein|Ashley Drane]] as Punk rock girl\n*Eddie Driscoll as Chuck\n*[[Shakara Ledard]] as Jessica\n*Ivan Martin as Nick\n*[[Nancy Pimental]] as Natalie\n*[[Greg Rikaart]] as Scott\n*[[Sandra Seacat]] as Jacki's mom\n*Eddie Driscoll as Chuck\n*Francois Harold as Johnny\n*[[Benjam\u00edn Ben\u00edtez]] as drug dealer\n*Joannah Portman as sorority girl 1\n*Hallie King as sorority girl 2\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nCheri Lovedog wrote the stage musical ''Prey for Rock & Roll'' based on her own experiences fronting the punk band Lovedog, who opened for groups like [[Jane's Addiction|Jane\u2019s Addiction]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[L7 (band)|L7]] and [[X (American band)|X]] in the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Chautard |first=Andre |date=2003-09-24 |title='Preying' for a break |work=Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-sep-24-et-chautard24-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=2022-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102225026/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-sep-24-et-chautard24-story.html |archive-date=2022-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=May 28, 2003 |title=Let Us Prey |url=https://www.goodtimes.sc/archives/cruz/05.28.03/prey-0322.html |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=Metro Santa Cruz}}</ref> The musical was staged in the summer of 2000 at New York's [[CBGB]] club.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the film adaptation, Lovedog did not want actresses to [[Lip sync|lip-sync]] to another singer's vocals.
