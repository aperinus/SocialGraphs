Wollheim]]'s [[short story]] of the same name, and starring [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Jeremy Northam]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn New York City, [[cockroach]]es are spreading the deadly \"Strickler's disease\" that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Due to an inability to develop a cure or vaccine for the disease Dr. Peter Mann, deputy director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], recruits [[entomology|entomologist]] Dr. Susan Tyler. In response, Dr. Tyler uses [[genetic engineering]] to create what she calls the \"[[Judas]] breed\", a hybrid between a mantis and a termite that releases an enzyme which accelerates the roaches' metabolism, with the effect that the roaches burn calories faster than they can nourish themselves and thus starve to death. The roaches carrying the disease are successfully eradicated, and Peter and Susan later marry.\n\nThree years later, a priest is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, a boy on the autism spectrum with a habit of imitating noises who refers to the attacker as \"Mr. Funny Shoes\" to his disbelieving guardian, an immigrant [[Rapid transit|subway]] [[shoe shiner]] named Manny. Later two kids sell a \"weird bug\" from the subway to Susan, which she performs tests on, and realizes is similar to the Judas breed. Initially, she believes that this is impossible since the specimens she released were all female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, which should have ensured that the breed would die off after a single generation. Before she can examine the insect further it is stolen by a strange figure who escapes out the window. After informing the police she later consults with her mentor, Dr. Gates, who autopsies a larger specimen found in the city's sewage treatment plants, and finds that its organs are fully formed, meaning the Judas breed is not only alive but has developed into a viable species, with a sizable [[Insect colony|colony]] underneath the city.\n\nLooking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed by the same strange assailant. Meanwhile, Chuy enters the abandoned church of the dead priest to find \"Mr. Funny Shoes\" and is abducted. Peter, his assistant Josh and [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (New York)|MTA]] officer Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get stuck and send Josh for help. Susan encounters what appears to be a shadowy man in a trench coat on a train platform. As she approaches it, the figure unfolds into an insect the size of a human being. The creature abducts Susan and carries her into the tunnels. Meanwhile, Josh finds a way out but is found by a Judas and killed. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, and they barricade themselves inside a train car.\n\nSusan surmises that the Judas breed's accelerated metabolism has allowed them to reproduce at a similarly accelerated rate, causing them to [[evolution|evolve]] over tens of thousands of generations within only three years, developing both lungs granting increased size and the ability to [[mimicry|mimic]] their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: using the remains of a dead bug to mask their scent as they work Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels and overrun the city unless they are able to kill the colony's single fertile male. While trying to reach the track switches, Manny finds Chuy who has managed to survive due to his imitating the clicking noises the bugs use for communication, but before they can escape Manny is killed by the male Judas. Susan, realizing Manny has been gone too long, goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard's injured leg starts bleeding heavily and knowing the smell will only incite the creatures and endanger the group, he creates a diversion that allows the others to get away, before being killed. Peter finds a [[dumbwaiter]] and puts Susan and Chuy in it, but stays behind to destroy the breed for good. He is chased into a room where hundreds are nesting and blows them all up by setting fire to a loose gas pipe, before diving underwater to safety.\n\nThe male Judas however escapes the blast and goes after Chuy but is distracted by Susan, who lures it into the path of an oncoming train, which runs over it. The two successfully make it to the surface, with Susan assuming that Peter had died in the blast. She then sees what appears to be another Judas, only for it to be revealed to actually be Peter alive and well. The film ends with the three reuniting and embracing one another.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Dr. Susan Tyler\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Dr. Peter Mann\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Josh Maslow\n* [[Charles S.

However, Luppi's English pronunciation was not good enough for the film, so del Toro chose Giancarlo Giannini instead; in a 2013 interview del Toro confirmed the story and stated that what he misses the most about working in the [[Spanish language]] is the possibility of directing Luppi, for whom del Toro professes the utmost admiration.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/escenarios/guillermo-del-toro-entrevista_0_rkfb6BLjPmx.html Guillermo del Toro: \u201cI have no interest in normal superheroes\u201d] 2013-07-17, ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'' {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the film's actors, [[Josh Brolin]] and Alix Koromzay, had previously starred in ''[[Nightwatch (1997 film)|Nightwatch]]'', another Dimension/Miramax horror film from 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nightwatch (1997) Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119791/fullcredits |website=IMDB |access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref> Its director, [[Ole Bornedal]], served as a producer on ''Mimic''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Petrikin |first1=Chris |title=Miramax picks 'Rose' |magazine=Variety |date=September 12, 1997}}</ref> The film features [[Norman Reedus]] in his Hollywood debut.\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography occurred in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], due to the city's similarities to [[New York City|New York]].<ref>{{cite web|author=By JANET MASLINAUG. 22, 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/22/movies/the-6-foot-cockroach-waiting-for-the-train.html |title=The 6-Foot Cockroach, Waiting for the Train - The New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=1997-08-22 |access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> The film includes several examples of del Toro's most characteristic hallmarks: \"I have a sort of a fetish for insects, clockwork, monsters, dark places, and unborn things\", said del Toro,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-dish.co.uk/2008/03/06/pans-labyrinth-2006 |title=theDISH \u00bb The Dish - Maintenance Mode |publisher=The Dish |access-date=2013-07-05}}</ref> and this is evident in ''Mimic'', where at times all are combined in long, brooding shots of dark, cluttered, muddy chaotic spaces.
