Hume must protect his family from the gang's resulting vengeance.\n\nThe film premiered on August 31, 2007, and was released on DVD on January 8, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Hume, a businessman living in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], goes to watch his son Brendan's [[ice hockey|hockey]] game. As they are driving home, they stop at a gas station in a bad part of town. During an apparent robbery of the gas station, Joe Darley, a new gang member, slices Brendan's throat with a machete. Nick ambushes the thugs, pulls off Joe's mask and sees his face. Joe escapes, only to get hit by a car. Nick rushes Brendan to the hospital, but the boy dies.\n\nNick identifies Joe in a police line-up, but is outraged when the [[district attorney]] tells him that the defense will cut a deal for a light sentence, since there is not enough evidence to take the case to trial. At a pre-trial hearing, Nick recants his identification so Joe will go free. After following the gang to their hideout, Nick waits until Joe is alone and stabs him to death. The gang leader, Billy, wants revenge. One of the gang members says his sister saw a man in a suit on the night when Joe was killed. Confirming it was Nick from a newspaper picture, they ambush him on the street. He is chased to a parkade. He manages to stay hidden, and runs up the parkade levels, jumping on vehicles as he goes. The alarms from the cars are going off which seems to confuse Billy and his gang. Nick ends up on the top level where a gang member is closing in. Nick fights for his life, and ends up trapped in a car with the guy. As the car is hit into reverse it heads to go over the parkade. Nick escapes just in time, but the gang member plummets to his death, \nAnother of the gang members arrives at Nick's office to deliver a suitcase he dropped during the chase. Nick calls a phone number found in the case, which belongs to Billy. Billy warns that Nick has bought a \"death sentence\" for his family, revealing that Joe was his brother. Nick immediately calls Jessica Wallis, the detective assigned to Brendan's case, who is already aware of what Nick started. Jessica grants Nick's family police protection and issues [[all-points bulletin|APBs]] on Billy and his gang. That night, the officers at Nick's house are stealthily killed, but by the time Nick realizes, he finds the gang members are in the house. They attack and subdue Nick, then drag Helen and Lucas downstairs to shoot them; Helen dies while Lucas is hospitalized.\n\nAfter Jessica gives a speech that wars are never settled, she lets Nick pay a visit to a [[coma]]tose Lucas, where he apologizes for not being a better father. Nick escapes from the hospital to go after the remaining gang members, obtaining guns from a [[black market]] gun dealer named Bones, who, at the conclusion of their transaction, reveals himself as Billy's father. Nick tracks down Heco, a member of the gang, and interrogates him about where the other members are, learning their lair is an abandoned mental hospital that they call \"The Office\". He forces Heco at gunpoint to call Billy's cell phone, and executes him while Billy is listening. Bones confronts Billy, who kills him. Nick heads to \"The Office\" to wipe out the surviving gang. After a shootout, he and Billy encounter and seriously wound each other in the hospital chapel. Sitting on the same pew, Billy claims that he turned Nick into a vicious cold-blooded killer just like him. Nick pulls out his [[Colt Python|revolver]] and asks Billy if he's ready to meet his maker, as Billy sheds a tear before Nick ends his life. With his family now avenged, Nick returns home, watches his own family's movies and awaits his inevitable arrest. When she arrives, Jessica informs him that Lucas has improved and will now live. Nick becomes relieved and sees his family happily singing on the couch.\n\n===Alternative ending===\nIn the extended version of the film, Nick succumbs to his injuries.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Nick Hume\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Billy Darley\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Helen Hume\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as Detective Jessica Wallis\n* [[John Goodman]] as Bones Darley\n* [[Matt O'Leary]] as Joe Darley\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Spink\n* [[Stuart Lafferty]] as Brendan Hume\n* [[Zachary Dylan Smith]] as Young Brendan Hume\n* [[Jordan Garrett]] as Lucas Hume\n* [[Edi Gathegi]] as Bodie\n* [[Yorgo Constantine]] as Michael Behring\n* Hector Atreyu Ruiz as Heco\n* [[Kanin Howell]] as Baggy\n* [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Roberts]] as Judge Shaw\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Brian Garfield]], author of the original novel ''[[Death Wish (novel)|Death Wish]]'' and its sequel ''[[Death Sentence (novel)|Death Sentence]]'', was disappointed with the film adaption of ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' and the [[Death Wish (film series)|subsequent sequels]]. In 1980, he was hired by [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] to write a film adaptation of ''Death Sentence'' to be helmed by the first film's director [[Michael Winner]]. However, [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] disliked the second novel and instead decided to purchase the rights to Garfield's characters rather than adapting the novel itself. They also purchased the rights to the first film from [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. The subsequent film ''[[Death Wish II]]'' was strictly a sequel to the first film and bore no relation to Garfield's novel.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Death Sentence |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56753-DEATH-WISH-II?cxt=filmography |access-date=2022-06-09 |website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film franchise has since gathered a cult following after the release of its third part, ''[[Death Wish 3]]''. After [[James Wan]] had read Brian Garfield's novels and seen all the film adaptions, he got an inspiration to make his film about the novels. Brian Garfield was impressed after he was hired to make the first few drafts for the film to make the film what Garfield had imagined it to be. The rest of the chosen draft was written by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Kevin Bacon]] was hired after James saw him as the perfect choice for the role of Nick Hume. [[Garrett Hedlund]] was chosen for the role of Billy Darley, the main leader of the gang. He was asked to shave his head and gain some weight, to which he agreed. He also watched a documentary about lions to portray Billy's animalistic nature. [[Aisha Tyler]] had been cast as the detective, Jessica Wallis. She was originally written as a 50-year-old male detective, but the choice was cancelled. Other cast members include [[John Goodman]], [[Judith Roberts (actress)|Judith Roberts]] and [[Stuart Lafferty]].\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in 2 months. The filming locations included, [[Columbia, South Carolina]] and [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n===Music===\nThe music was composed by [[Charlie Clouser]].\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Death Sentence'' opened in 1,822 theaters in the United States and grossed $4,231,321, with an average of $2,322 per theater and ranking #8 at the box office. The film ultimately earned $9,534,258 domestically and $7,440,201 internationally for a total of $16,974,459.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 20% of 113 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.20/10. The critical consensus states: \"A nonsensical plot and an absurd amount of violence make this revenge pic gratuitous and overwrought.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_sentence/ |title=Death Sentence \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=March 9, 2021 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The film has a score of 36 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 24 critics, indicating \"Generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/deathsentence |title=Death Sentence (2007): Reviews |access-date=2007-09-14 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film {{frac|2|1|2}} stars out of 4. He compared ''Death Sentence'' to the ''[[Death Wish (film series)|Death Wish]]'' films starring [[Charles Bronson]], saying: \"In the Bronson movies, the hero just looked more and more determined until you felt if you tapped his face, it would explode. In ''Death Sentence'', Bacon acts out a lot more.\" Ebert called ''Death Sentence'' \"very efficient\", praising \"a courtroom scene of true surprise and suspense, and some other effective moments\", but concluded that \"basically this is a movie about a lot of people shooting at each other\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070830/REVIEWS/70817018 |title=Reviews \u2013 Death Sentence |access-date=2007-09-14 |author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=2007-08-31 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nScott Tobias of ''[[The A.V.

As a father he is touching and as a stone-cold killing machine he is even more convincing.\"<ref>[http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/reviews.php?film_id=12727 Death Sentence Movie Review (2007)] Darren Amner, Eye for Film, 2007</ref>\n\nAuthor [[Brian Garfield]], who wrote the novel the film is loosely based on, said of the film: \"While I could have done with a bit less blood-and-thunder, I think it's a stunningly good movie. In the details of its story it's quite different from the novel, but it's a movie, not a novel. In its cinematic way it connects with its audience and it makes the same point the book makes, and those are the things that count.\" He also liked that, like his novels, but unlike the ''Death Wish'' film series, it does not advocate vigilantism.<ref>[http://www.briangarfield.net/events.htm Briangarfield.net] Retrieved 2007-09-14</ref> Garfield further explained in an interview: \"I think that, except for its ludicrous violence toward the end, the ''Death Sentence'' movie does depict its character's decline and the stupidity of vengeful vigilantism,\" adding, \"As a story it made the point I wanted it to make.\"<ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/historian-interview-with-brian-garfield Historian: Interview with Brian Garfield] Nikki Tranter, PopMatters, March 5, 2008</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0804461}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=death_sentence}}\n*{{Metacritic film}}\n*{{mojo title|id=deathsentence}}\n*{{Amg movie|361876}}\n\n{{The Death Wish Pentalogy}}\n{{James Wan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Death Sentence (2007 Film)}}\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2007 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2007 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2007 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s gang films]]\n[[Category:2007 thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Hyde Park Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:2007 action drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American gang films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charlie Clouser]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Wan]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:American vigilante films]]\n[[Category:American psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Brian Garfield]]\n[[Category:Death Wish (film series)]]\n[[Category:2000s vigilante films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films set in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
