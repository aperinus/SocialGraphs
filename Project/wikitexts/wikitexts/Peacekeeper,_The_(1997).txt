The film follows [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] Major Frank Cross, who is the only man who can prevent the president being assassinated. He must also prevent an impending [[nuclear holocaust]]. The threat is from a terrorist group, which has stolen the President's personal communications computer; it has the capability of launching the U.S. arsenal. The film was shot on location in the city of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ovguide.com/the-peacekeeper-9202a8c04000641f8000000009414ab5 |title=Ovguide |access-date=2015-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075856/https://www.ovguide.com/the-peacekeeper-9202a8c04000641f8000000009414ab5 |archive-date=2015-05-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nUnited States Air Force Major Frank Cross is in trouble with the \"brass\" again, after making an unauthorized humanitarian relief flight, dropping sacks of rice to starving [[Kurds]]. The press considers him a hero, requiring him by the President's side during his election campaign and thus preventing the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] from court-martialling him.<ref>[http://putlocker.is/watch-the-peacekeeper-online-free-putlocker.htm Pulocker]</ref> Instead, they assign him to carry the [[Nuclear football|\"black bag\"]], the President's high-tech briefcase containing the \"go codes\" and communications computer for launching America's nuclear ICBM arsenal in case of a national emergency.\n\nHowever, on his first day on the job in [[Chicago]] a team of mercenaries manages to steal the black bag. Cross, however, manages to fake his death and infiltrate the mercenaries. Thinking they have seen the last of him, they fly with a helicopter from the rooftops of Chicago into the night sky and onwards to their final target: United States Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Facility K-7. A disguised Cross slips into the missile silo as the team murders the silo personnel and takes over the launch control using the secret codes contained in the black bag.\n \nThey are led by ex-Marine Colonel Douglas Murphy, whose unit was sent to kill [[Saddam Hussein]] during an undercover operation in Iraq before [[Operation Desert storm|Operation Desert Storm]] and was then exterminated by the President, who was [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief]] at the time, for political reasons. Driven by revenge, he launches a terrifying warning shot and sends a Peacekeeper nuclear missile that destroys [[Mount Rushmore]], killing thousands. Only then does Murphy make his chilling demand: unless the President kills himself in front of a live television audience, [[Washington D.C.]] will be destroyed.\n\nAll attempts to stop one of the missiles from leaving the silo fail. Finally, the President gives in to Murphy's demand, only to realise that Murphy lied to humiliate him, so that he then should helplessly watch Washington be destroyed as Murphy helplessly had to watch his unit be destroyed against his will by the President. At the first opportunity, however, Frank acts against the terrorists and, with the help of the last surviving member of the silo, Lt. Colonel Northrop, he is able to kill the mercenaries and prevent the destruction of Washington in the nick of time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Major Frank Cross \n* [[Michael Sarrazin]] as Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Murphy \n* [[Montel Williams]] as Lieutenant Colonel Northrop \n* [[Roy Scheider]] as President Robert Baker \n* [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Hettinger \n* Allen Altman as McGarry \n* Martin Neufeld as Decker \n* [[Monika Schnarre]] as Jane Cross\n* Michael Caloz as Billy Cross\n* Tim Post as Nelson \n* Carl Alacchi as Holbrook \n* Chip Chuipka as Davis \n* Roc LaFortune as Abbott \n* Gouchy Boy as Robinson \n* Phil Chiu as Kong\n* Michel Perron as Space Command Controller\n* [[Serge Houde]] as Secretary of Defence\n* David Francis as Major General Harding\n* [[Vlasta Vrana]] as General Douglas\n* Frank Fontaine as General Greenfield\n* David Nichols as General Joseph\n* [[Mark Camacho]] as Presidential Aide #1\n* [[Susan Glover]] as Presidential Aide #2\n* Larry Day as Secret Service Agent Maxwell\n* Alan Fawcett as Secret Service Agent Samuels\n* Philip Pretten as Secret Service Agent Clark\n* Andy Bradshaw as Secret Service Agent Johnson\n{{div col end}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119872|title=The Peacekeeper}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|peacekeeper}}\n* {{amg movie|174266}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=473940}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peacekeeper, The}}\n[[Category:1997 action films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:American action films]]\n[[Category:Canadian action films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forestier]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
