It is the sequel to ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' (2006) and the third installment in the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' film series]]. It was directed by [[Carlos Saldanha]]. [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Denis Leary]], and [[Chris Wedge]] reprise their roles from the first two films and [[Seann William Scott]], [[Josh Peck]], and [[Queen Latifah]] reprise their roles from ''The Meltdown'', with [[Simon Pegg]] joining them in the role of a weasel named Buck. The story has [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]] the Sloth being kidnapped by a female ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' after stealing her eggs, leading the rest of the herd to rescue him in a tropical lost world inhabited by [[dinosaur]]s underneath the ice.\n\nThe film was released on July 1, 2009, becoming the first ''Ice Age'' film and the first 20th Century Fox film to be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"LATFoxBuy3-DGlasses\"/> It received mixed reviews from critics, and has grossed $886.6 million worldwide, making it the [[2009 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2009]], the highest-grossing animated film of 2009, the highest-grossing ''Ice Age'' film and the highest-grossing film from Blue Sky Studios.<ref name=\"NJHoboken\" /><ref name=\"ChinaTopFive3-D\"/> Two sequels, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', were released in 2012 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=August 2022}}\nEllie is pregnant, making Manny excited and overprotective, desperate to make life perfect and safe for both Ellie and their upcoming child, not wanting them to meet the same fate as his previous wife and child. However, this causes him to become distant and negligent of Diego, who debates whether he should leave the herd because he thinks that he's losing his edge as a hunter and isn't meant for the family life, and Sid, who begins to wish for a family of his own and adopts three apparently lost eggs that he finds in an icy cave, naming them Eggbert, Shelly and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores him and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' the next morning. Because Sid is literally the first thing the Baby Dinos see, they think he is their real mother and follow him everywhere he goes. Meanwhile, while looking for his beloved acorn, Scrat meets a female flying saber-tooth squirrel named Scratte, whom he falls in love with. But when he finds Scratte storing an acorn for the winter season, he gets greedy and steals it from her. Scratte then starts to cry making Scrat give back the acorn, but due to his obsession with acorns, refuses to let go. While doing so, he accidentally throws her off the cliff. He jumps to save her, but she tricks him and steals back the acorn while he falls from the cliff. The two continuously fight each other for the acorn afterwards.\n\nAlthough Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins the playground Manny built for his child, angering Manny. Not long after, a female ''Tyrannosaurus,'' known as Momma Dino, whose eggs Sid stole, returns. When Sid refuses to return the babies, she carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie follow as well and discover that the icy cave leads to a vast [[Hollow Earth|subterranean jungle]] populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. There, they meet a deranged, quick-witted, one-eyed [[weasel]] named Buck when saves them from a crowd of angry, carnivorous dinosaurs surrounding them.\n\nBuck reveals that he has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is hunting down Rudy, a huge fearsome, ill-tempered and hostile [[Albinism|albino]] ''[[Baryonyx]]'' feared by the inhabitants of the jungle, intending to avenge the eye he lost to him years prior during an ill-fated encounter. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where the Momma Dino has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Scrat and Scratte continue their battle for the acorn back, but during one of their fights, Scrat saves Scratte from falling into a river of lava, causing them to fall in love with each other and forget about the acorn as Scratte tries to fly away with Scrat's acorn. Meanwhile, Momma tries to eat Sid, but her babies protect him, still thinking he is their mother. Afterwards, she and Sid try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring, as Sid prefers a vegetarian diet while she wants them to follow their carnivorous instincts; Sid loses this contest but Momma slowly warms up to Sid after realizing how much he genuinely loves the babies as his own, and welcomes him into her family, as he is the closest thing her children have to a father. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the ''Tyrannosaurus'' family and is attacked by Rudy. He is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.\n\nAs the herd moves toward the lava falls, Ellie suddenly goes into labor and a pack of ''[[Guanlong]]'' attack them, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. While Manny makes his way up to her, Diego assists in the delivery and fends off further attacks. Meanwhile, Buck takes Crash and Eddie to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered ''[[Harpactognathus]]'', narrowly saving Sid's life. The Baby Dinos are saddened when they see Sid being carried away by the ''Harpactognathus'', along with Momma, who has grown fond of Sid. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. The couple agree to name the baby \"Peaches\". Sid is happy to reunite with his friends, but gets sad at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to the Baby Dinos. Scrat and Scratte have some romantic moments together, both forgeting about the acorn.\n\nBefore they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy. Working together, Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The herd is saved by the timely arrival of Momma, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff where he falls to his presumed death. Sid then says goodbye to his children, realizing that the jungle is where they belong, while Momma acknowledges him as their real father, even though they are not blood related. Having realized that Momma is their real mother, the Baby Dinos follow her as she leaves, but not before hugging their adopted father as a final goodbye. Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive. Because of this he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle by severing the vines supporting a skeleton bridge that causes a cave-in at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and Manny admits to Sid that he was a good father to the baby dinosaurs. Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling with Rudy. Meanwhile Scrat and Scratte decide to live in the jungle together. Unfortunately, Scrat's greed for his precious acorn overcomes his newfound romance with Scratte, along with getting tired of her bossy ways, and he ultimately chooses the acorn over her. The two battle once more for the acorn, which results in Scrat being accidentally launched back to the surface while Scratte falls back in the dinosaur world after Scrat uses her own trick from the beginning against her, making it her new home. Scrat taunts her about the acorn, but once again loses it after a large piece of ice knocks it out of his hands, much to his frustration.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]], a [[woolly mammoth]] and the leader of The Herd.

Character designer Peter de S\u00e8ve welcomed the new plot addition, since he could not think of any other giant mammal to put into the story. The \"lost world\" approach led to colorful dinosaurs, because \"the dinosaurs didn't have to be just brown, and you can take liberties because no one knows what color they were\", according to de S\u00e8ve. Rudy's design was inspired by the ''[[Baryonyx]]'' because of his crocodile-like look, which de S\u00e8ve considered even more menacing than the ''T. rex''.<ref name=\"Wloszczyna\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-06-29-ice-age-dinosaurs_N.htm|title='Ice Age' warms up to dinosaurs in third installment|work=[[USA Today]]|date=June 30, 2009|access-date=August 20, 2009|first=Susan|last=Wloszczyna|archive-date=May 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502000855/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-06-29-ice-age-dinosaurs_N.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' held special screenings on [[Father's Day]], June 21, 2009, in 330 theaters across the United States, exclusively in 3-D.<ref name=\"AWNPreviewsFathersDay\">{{cite web |last1=Moody |first1=Annemarie |title=Sneak Previews of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs on Father's Day |url=https://www.awn.com/news/sneak-previews-ice-age-dawn-dinosaurs-fathers-day |publisher=Animation World Network |access-date=April 26, 2021 |language=en |date=June 19, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-date=April 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426125608/https://www.awn.com/news/sneak-previews-ice-age-dawn-dinosaurs-fathers-day }}</ref> That day was chosen due to the film featuring a theme of fatherhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ice Age Gets Father's Day Sneak |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/19/ice-age-gets-fathers-day-sneak |website=IGN |access-date=April 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426124244/https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/19/ice-age-gets-fathers-day-sneak |archive-date=April 26, 2021 |language=en |date=June 19, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Widely, it was released on July 1, 2009.<ref name=\"AWNPreviewsFathersDay\" />\n\nThe film was released in [[RealD 3D]] where available.
