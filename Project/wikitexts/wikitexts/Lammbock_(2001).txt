The protagonists of the movie are two [[pizza delivery]] men who decide to up their income by adding [[marijuana]] to the menu and get into trouble after attracting the attention of an [[undercover]] cop. There are numerous subplots, and the movie is essentially divided into various chapters, each dealing with different episodes. It is filmed in and around the [[Franconia]]n city of [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and in [[Cologne]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\n== Plot ==\nKai and Stefan are two friends who own a gourmet pizza delivery business as a front for selling cannabis. Stefan is finishing law school and preparing to take the [[Bar examination]] to become a [[lawyer]] under the behest of his father, who is a judge. They visit their outdoor cannabis growing operation only to discover that [[aphids]] are destroying their plants. They visit a [[head shop]] and meet Achim, who informs them that he knows how to get rid of aphids, handing them a tub full of ''[[Aphidoletes aphidimyza]]''. However, unbeknownst to the protagonists, Achim is an undercover police officer.\n\nAfter much debate, the duo decide to bring Achim to the plantation so that he can help with the aphid problem, using an adulterant on the plants called \"Brain cell massacre,\" which, according to Achim, is used in [[Kazakhstan]] plantations. On the way to the growing area, they try to pick [[psychedelic mushrooms]], convinced that nobody will be suspicious of mushrooms on a pizza. They test them out on Achim while he is at the plantation, stating that they already tried some. Achim is poisoned by the mushrooms and goes into a convulsive state, when suddenly a hunter is spotted nearby. The \"Brain cell massacre\" is used to knock Achim out, and he is locked in the protagonists' trunk, along with the hunter who discovered the cannabis plantation as well as the harvested crop itself.\n\nAfter narrowly avoiding an unrelated police search, the duo confront Stefan's father and confess their situation. Though Stefan's father becomes upset, he calls the chief of police, whom he befriended when he was a public prosecutor. With the help of the chief of police, the duo get off the hook, and Stefan takes his bar exam only to walk out at the last minute to pursue his lifelong dream of owning a cafe on a beach.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lucas Gregorowicz]] as Stefan Becker \n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Kai\n* [[Marie Zielcke]] as Laura Becker\n* Julian Weigend as Achim\n* [[Elmar Wepper]] as Vater Becker\n* Alexandra Schalaudek as Gina\n* Christof Wackernagel as Ausbilder Walter\n* [[Antoine Monot, Jr.]] as Sch\u00f6ngeist\n* [[Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring]] as Frank\n* Nils Brunkhorst as Dopex\n* [[Alexandra Neldel]] as Jenny\n* Christoph K\u00fcnzler as J\u00e4ger\n* Peter Fieseler as Tim\n* Thomas Schende as Dr. Kollmann\n* Anya Hoffmann as Elena Kollmann\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n*The director was heavily influenced by [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Kevin Smith]].
