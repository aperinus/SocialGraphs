Because of his pathological [[fear of flying]] and subsequent \"drinking problem\"\u2014he splashes beverages anywhere but into his mouth\u2014Ted has been unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, now a [[flight attendant]], breaks off her relationship with him before boarding her rostered flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Chicago]]. Ted abandons his taxi and buys a ticket on the same flight to try to win her back. Once on board, however, Elaine continues to reject him, causing Ted to accidentally drive several other passengers to suicide as he sadly reminisces.\n\nAfter the in-flight meal is served, the entire flight crew and several passengers fall ill. Passenger Dr. Rumack discovers that the fish served during meal service has caused [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. With the flight crew incapacitated, Elaine contacts the Chicago [[control tower]] for help and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane's [[autopilot]], a large inflatable dummy pilot dubbed \"Otto\", which will get them to Chicago but not be able to land the plane. Elaine and Rumack convince Ted to take the controls. When Steve learns Ted is piloting, he contacts Ted's former commanding officer, Rex Kramer\u2014now serving as a commercial pilot\u2014to help talk Ted through the landing procedure. Ted becomes uneasy when Kramer starts giving orders and he briefly breaks down amid more wartime flashbacks. Elaine and Rumack both bolster Ted's confidence and he manages to once again take the controls.\n\nAs the plane nears Chicago, the weather worsens, complicating the landing. With Elaine's help as co-pilot and Rex's guidance from the tower, Ted is able to land the plane safely, despite the landing gear shearing off, and the passengers suffer only minor injuries. Rescue vehicles arrive to help unload the plane. Impressed by Ted's display of courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. The two watch as \"Otto\" takes control of the plane, inflates a female companion, and takes off.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Airplane screenshot Haggerty Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|''From left'': the inflatable autopilot \"Otto\" with Julie Hagerty and Leslie Nielsen in the cockpit]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Hays]] as Ted Striker\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Elaine Dickinson\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Dr. Rumack\n* [[Peter Graves]] as Captain Clarence Oveur\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Steve McCroskey\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Captain Rex Kramer\n* [[Lorna Patterson]] as Randy\n* [[Stephen Stucker]] as Air Traffic Controller Johnny Henshaw-Jacobs\n* [[Frank Ashmore]] as Victor Basta\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Gunderson\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as First Officer Roger Murdock\n* Craig Berenson as Paul Carey\n* [[Barbara Billingsley]] as Jive Lady\n* [[Lee Bryant]] as Mrs. Hammen\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Jim Hammen\n* [[Joyce Bulifant]] as Mrs. Davis\n* [[Maureen McGovern]] as Nun\n* [[Kenneth Tobey]] as Air Controller Neubauer\n* Marcy Goldman as Mrs. Geline\n* [[Barbara Stuart]] as Mrs. Kramer\n* [[Ross Harris (actor)|Ross Harris]] as Joey Hammen\n* Norman Alexander Gibbs as First Jive Dude\n* [[Al White]] as Second Jive Dude\n* David Hollander as Young Boy with Coffee\n* Michelle Stacy as Young Girl with Coffee\n* [[David Leisure]] as First Krishna\n* [[Jason Wingreen]] as Dr. Brody\n* [[Jill Whelan]] as Lisa Davis\n* [[Ethel Merman]] as Lieutenant Hurwitz\n* Lee Terri as Mrs. Linda Oveur\n* [[Jimmie Walker]] as Windshield Wiper Man\n* [[James Hong]] as Japanese General\n* [[Howard Jarvis]] as Man in Taxi\n* Michael Laurence as Newscaster\n* [[Herb Voland]] as Air Controller Macias\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Jerry Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]], and [[David Zucker]] (collectively known as [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]], or ZAZ) wrote ''Airplane!'' while they were performing with the [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|Kentucky Fried Theatre]], a theatre group they founded in 1971. To obtain material for comedy routines, they routinely recorded late night television and reviewed the tapes later primarily to pull the commercials, a process Abrahams compared to \"[[Seine fishing|seining for fish]]\".<ref name=\"avclub oral\">{{cite news | url = https://www.avclub.com/article/surely-you-cant-be-serious-oral-history-airplane-218043 | title = Surely you can't be serious: An oral history of Airplane! | first = Will | last = Harris | date = April 17, 2015 | access-date = April 17, 2015 | newspaper = [[The A.V.

It was the first film script they wrote, completed around 1975,<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/> and was originally called ''The Late Show''. The script originally stayed close to the dialog and plot of ''Zero Hour!'', as ZAZ thought they did not have a sufficient understanding of film at the time to structure a proper script.<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/> ZAZ's script borrowed so much from ''Zero Hour!'' that they believed they needed to negotiate the rights to create the remake of the film and ensure they remain within the allowance for parody within copyright law. They were able to obtain the rights from Warner Bros. and Paramount for about $2,500 at the time.<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/> The original script contained spoofs of television commercials but people who proofread it advised them to shorten the commercials, and they eventually removed them. When their script was finished, they were unable to sell it.<ref name=directors>{{cite book|pages=337\u2013342|title=The Directors: Take One|author=Emery, Robert J.|chapter=The films of Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker|publisher=Allworth Communications, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58115-218-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile failing to sell their script, the trio met director [[John Landis]], who encouraged them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' into production in the late 1970s. David Zucker said \"it was the first time we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that if you really wanted a movie to come out the way you wanted it to, you had to direct. So on the next movie, ''Airplane!'', we insisted on directing\".<ref name=directors/>\n\nEventually the ''Airplane!'' script found its way to Paramount through [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner learned of the script via Susan Baerwald, another scriptwriter with [[United Artists]], and had [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] track down and meet with ZAZ to discuss details.<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/> [[Avco Embassy Pictures]] also expressed interest in producing the film, but ZAZ decided to go with Paramount.<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/>\n\nParamount insisted the film be shot in color rather than black-and-white as ZAZ wanted, and to be set aboard a jet airliner rather than propeller plane to better identify with modern filmgoers. In exchange, Paramount acquiesced to ZAZ's desire to cast serious actors for the film rather than comedy performers.<ref name=\"telegraph 40th\"/> Principal photography began on June 20, 1979, and wrapped on August 31, with the bulk of filming having been done in August. Jerry Zucker stood beside the camera during shooting, while David Zucker and Jim Abrahams watched the video feed to see how the film would look; they conferred after each take.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/robert-hays,62766/|title=Random Roles: Robert Hays|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|work=avclub.com|date=October 4, 2011|access-date=October 20, 2012|archive-date=October 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031060323/http://www.avclub.com/articles/robert-hays%2C62766/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nDavid Zucker explained that \"the trick was to cast actors like [[Robert Stack]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]. These were people who, up to that time, had never done comedy.

They showed him a tape of impressionist [[John Byner]] impersonating Robert Stack. According to the producers, Stack was \"doing an impression of John Byner doing an impression of Stack\".<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Stack was not initially interested in the part, but ZAZ persuaded him. Bridges' children advised him to take the part.<ref name=directors/> Graves rejected the script at first, considering it tasteless. During filming, ZAZ had explained to Graves that his lines spoken to a young boy, like \"Have you ever seen a grown man naked?\", would \"be explained later in a part that you aren't in\".<ref name=\"telegraph 40th\"/> On the DVD commentary, Abrahams said: \"I don't understand. What did he think was tasteless about pedophilia?\"<ref name=nytimes1/>\n\nFor the role of Dr. Rumack, ZAZ initially suggested [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Christopher Lee]], and [[Jack Webb]], all of whom turned it down, before they considered Nielsen,<ref name=\"telegraph 40th\"/> who was \"just a fish in water\" in his role, according to Jerry Zucker.<ref name=\"avclub oral\"/> Nielsen's career to this point had consisted mostly of serious leading roles but he wanted to work in comedy and was looking for a film to help in the transition. He was considered a \"closet comedian\" on set, pranking his fellow actors between shots, but immediately adopted his somber, serious persona when performing as Rumack.<ref name=\"telegraph 40th\"/> During filming, Nielsen used a [[whoopee cushion]] to keep the cast off-balance.

The film marked a significant change in his film persona towards [[deadpan]] comedy, notably in the three ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' films: ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' (1988)''; [[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]]'' (1991)'';'' and ''[[Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult|Naked Gun 33\u2153: The Final Insult]]'' (1994). The films were based on the six-episode television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' which starred Nielsen and was created and produced by Zucker\u2013Abrahams\u2013Zucker. This also led to his casting, many years later, in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]''. Brooks had wanted to make the film for a long time, but put it off because, as he said: \"I just could not find the right Dracula\". According to Brooks, he didn't see ''Airplane!'' until years after its release. When he did, he knew Nielsen would be right for the part. When it was suggested that his role in ''Airplane!'' was [[Typecasting|against type]], Nielsen protested that he had \"always been cast against type before\", and that comedy was what he always really wanted to do.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Andrew |last1=Dalton |first2=Bob |last2=Thomas |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title='Airplane!', 'Forbidden Planet' actor Nielsen dies |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 29, 2010 |access-date=November 30, 2010 |archive-date=December 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208205723/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n* 2000: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] \u2013 No. 10<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=July 17, 2016 |archive-date=March 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316140859/http://afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Ted Striker: \"Surely you can't be serious\".\n:: Dr. Rumack: \"I am serious.
