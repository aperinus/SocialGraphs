Smith, ''The American International Pictures Video Guide'', McFarland 2009 p 40</ref>\n\nThis was the third Jack Hill film to star Grier after ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' and ''[[The Big Bird Cage]]''.

Under the guise of a prostitute willing to do anything for a drug fix, she lures a drug pusher and a mob boss to their residences, killing them. After the murders, Coffy returns to her job at a local [[Los Angeles]] hospital.\n\nAfter her shift, Coffy's police friend Carter offers to drive her home. Carter is a straight-shooting officer who is not willing to bend the law for the mob or the thugs who have been bribing officers at his precinct. Coffy doesn't believe his strong moral resolve until two hooded men break into Carter's house while she's visiting him and beat Carter, crippling him. This enrages Coffy, giving her further provocation to continue her work as a vigilante, killing those responsible for harming Carter and her sister.\n\nCoffy's boyfriend, Howard Brunswick, is a city councilman. Coffy admires Brunswick for his contributions to the community. Brunswick announces his plan to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]] and his purchase of a night club. Coffy's next targets are a pimp named King George, one of the largest suppliers of prostitutes and illegal drugs in the city, and Mafia don Arturo Vitroni, a criminal associate of George's.\n\nCoffy questions a former patient, a known drug user, to gain insight into the type of woman King George likes and where he keeps his stash of drugs. Coffy shows no sympathy for the drug-addled woman and abuses her as she looks for answers. With the information she gets from the woman, Coffy tracks down George and poses as a Jamaican woman looking to trick for him.\n\nGeorge, immediately interested in her exotic nature, hires her. One of the prostitutes becomes jealous. Later that day, Coffy and the other prostitutes get into a massive brawl.  Coffy wins, which attracts mob boss Vitroni, who demands to have her that night. Coffy plans to murder Vitroni, but before she can shoot him, his men overtake her. She lies and tells Vitroni that King George ordered her to kill him, which makes Vitroni order George to be murdered. Vitroni's men kill George by lynching him by the neck from his car, which they drive through an open field.\n\nCoffy then discovers Brunswick, her clean-cut boyfriend, is corrupt when she's shown to him at a meeting of the mob and several police officials. He denies knowing her other than as a prostitute, and Coffy is sent to her death. Coffy seduces her would-be killers. They try injecting her with drugs to sedate her, but she had replaced the illicit drugs with a sugar solution earlier. Faking a high, she kills her unsuspecting hitman with a pointed metal wire she fashioned herself and hid in her hair, by stabbing him in the [[jugular vein]].\n\nRunning to avoid capture, Coffy [[carjacking|carjacks]] a vehicle to escape. Coffy drives to Vitroni's house, murders him, and then goes to Brunswick's to do the same. He pleads for forgiveness and just as she is about to accept, a naked white woman comes out of his bedroom. Coffy shoots Brunswick in the groin with a [[shotgun]], [[emasculating]] and killing him.\n\nLater, Coffy walks along the beach having avenged her sister.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Nurse Flower Child \"Coffy\" Coffin\n* [[Booker Bradshaw]] as Howard Brunswick\n* [[Robert DoQui]] as George \"King George\"\n* [[William Elliott (African American actor)|William Elliott]] as Officer Carter\n* [[Allan Arbus]] as Arturo Vitroni\n* [[Sid Haig]] as Omar, Henchman of Vitroni\n* [[Barry Cahill (actor)|Barry Cahill]] as Officer McHenry\n* [[Lee de Broux]] as Officer Nick\n* Ruben Moreno as Captain Reuben Ramos\n* Lisa Farringer as Jeri, One of King George's Girls\n* [[Carol Locatell]] as Priscilla (credited as Carol Lawson)\n* [[Linda Haynes]] as Meg, One of King George's Girls\n* John Perak as Aleva, Henchman of Vitroni\n* Mwako Cumbuka as Grover, Sugarman's Henchman\n* Morris Buchanan as Sugarman\n* [[Robert Lee Minor|Bob Minor]] as Studs\n\n==Production==\nAccording to writer/director Hill, the project began when [[American International Pictures|American International Pictures']] head of production, Larry Gordon, lost the rights to the film ''[[Cleopatra Jones]]'' after making a handshake deal with the producers. Gordon subsequently approached Hill to quickly make a movie about an African-American woman's revenge and beat ''Cleopatra Jones'' to market. Hill wanted to work with [[Pam Grier]], whom he had worked with on ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' (1971). The film ended up earning more money than ''Cleopatra Jones'' and established Grier as an icon of the genre.{{sfn|Waddell|2009|pp=117-139}}\n\n''Coffy'' is notable in its depiction of a strong black female lead (a professional [[nurse]]), something rare in the genre at the time, and also in its then-unfashionable anti-drug message.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coffy |url=https://www.blerdsonline.com/2021/02/coffy.html |access-date=July 18, 2022 |website=Blerds Online}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Coffy (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie received a mixed reception at the time of its release.
