The film stars Branagh in the title role with [[Paul Scofield]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Alec McCowen]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Brian Blessed]], and [[Christian Bale]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film received worldwide critical acclaim and is considered to be one of the best Shakespeare film adaptations ever made. For her work on the film, [[Phyllis Dalton]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] and Kenneth Branagh, in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], received Oscar nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Chorus, in this case a person in modern dress, introducing the subject of the play.  He is walking through an empty film studio and ends his monologue by opening the doors to begin the main action.  Chorus reappears several times during the film, his speeches helping to explain and progress the action.\n\nThe following act divisions reflect the original play, not the film.\n\n===Act 1===\nEarly 15th century in [[England]]: The [[John Fordham|Bishop of Ely]] and the [[Henry Chichele|Archbishop of Canterbury]] collude to distract young [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] from passing a [[decree]] that might confiscate property from the church. They agree to talk him into invading [[France]].  Canterbury appears in the [[throne room]] and explains to the King's advisers that Henry is rightful heir to the throne of France on the grounds that the [[Salic law]] in France unjustly bars his claim to the throne and should be disregarded. Supported by the [[nobility|noblemen]] [[Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Westmoreland]], the [[clergymen]] manage to persuade Henry to declare war on France if his claim on the French crown is denied.\n\nHenry calls in [[Montjoy]], a representative of [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1397-1415)|the Dauphin]]. The Dauphin's condescending response takes the form of the delivery of a chest of tennis balls.  Exeter, who opens the chest, is appalled, but Henry at first takes the insult calmly. He goes on to state his determination to attack France, dismisses the ambassador and starts to plan his [[Military campaign|campaign]].\n\n[[John Falstaff]] is taken ill in [[Mistress Quickly]]'s inn. His friends [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]], [[Ancient Pistol]], and [[Corporal Nym]] remember the good times they had together with Henry before he was king and denounced them all.\n\n===Act 2===\nHenry tricks three high-ranked traitors into pronouncing their own sentence by asking advice on the case of a man who drunkenly shouted insults at him in the street. When they recommend that he show no mercy to this minor offender, the King reveals his knowledge of their own sedition. They draw their daggers, but are quickly subdued by Henry's loyal nobles.  Exeter arrests them for high treason and Henry orders their execution before crossing the [[English Channel]]. Falstaff dies and Bardolph, Pistol, Nym, and Falstaff's page, Robin, depart for France.\n \t\nMeanwhile, in France, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, the King of France]] and his noblemen discuss King Henry's threats. The Dauphin (portrayed as stubborn and cowardly) says he does not fear Henry, but Charles and [[Charles d'Albret|the Constable of France]] are worried because of Henry's martial ancestors and the successful previous English [[invasion]]s. Exeter arrives in full [[plate armour|armor]]. He informs them that Henry demands the French crown and is prepared to take it by force if it is withheld, and delivers an insulting message to the Dauphin. King Charles tells Exeter he will give him a reply the following day.\n\n===Act 3===\nKing Henry delivers a morale-boosting speech to his troops and attacks the [[walled city]] of [[Harfleur]]. When the Dauphin fails to relieve the city in time, the [[governor]] surrenders in return for Henry's promise to do Harfleur's population no harm. Henry orders Exeter to repair its fortifications.\n\nKatharine, a French princess who had been engaged to marry King Henry in an arrangement made before the war, asks her [[lady-in-waiting]] Alice to teach her some basics in English. Correct English [[pronunciation]] is very hard for her to learn but she is determined to accomplish it. In a silent moment, Katharine watches her father and his courtiers and notes how worried they appear. King Charles finally orders his nobles to engage Henry's troops, halt their advance, and bring Henry back a prisoner.\n\nThe English troops struggle toward [[Calais]] through foul weather and sickness. Bardolph is hanged for looting a church. The French herald Montjoy arrives and demands Henry pay a ransom for his person or place himself and his entire army at risk. Henry refuses, replying that even his reduced and sickly army is sufficient to resist a French attack.\n\n===Act 4===\nIn the boisterous French camp the night before the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415), the French nobility wait impatiently for the morning, and it is clear that the Dauphin is not popular with the other nobles. In the more sober and silent English camp, following a brief meeting with his brothers, [[Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] and [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|Bedford]], together with Sir [[Thomas Erpingham]], Henry decides to look into the state of his troops and wanders his camp in disguise. He meets Pistol, who fails to recognize him. Soon afterwards, he encounters a small group of soldiers, including Bates and Williams, with whom he debates his own culpability for any deaths to follow. He and Williams almost come to blows, and they agree to duel the day after, should they survive. When Williams and his friends leave the King alone, Henry breaks into a [[monologue]] about his burdens and prays to God for help.\n\nNext morning, the English Army is outnumbered five to one. Henry encourages his troops with his [[St Crispin's Day Speech]] and responds angrily when Montjoy renews the Dauphin's offer of ransom. The battle begins with the charge of the French cavalry, but the English [[English longbow|archery]] and countercharge cut down a large part of the advancing army before it ever reaches their lines. When the [[Constable of France]] is killed, the dismayed French leaders realize the battle is lost and become desperate. Some of them manage to get behind enemy lines and, deprived of any hope to turn the battle, break the [[chivalry|code of chivalry]] by murdering the young and defenseless English [[Page (occupation)|pages]] and setting fire to the English tents. Henry and his officer [[Fluellen]] come upon the carnage and are still appalled when Montjoy delivers the French surrender.\n\nHenry returns Williams' glove, this time out of disguise, and Williams is shocked to learn that the man he was arguing with the night before was King Henry himself.\n\nThe act ends with a four-minute long [[tracking shot]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dailytelegiraffe.tripod.com/henryvman.html|title = THE DAILY TELEGIRAFFE: Henry V--Kenneth Branagh: The Director}}</ref> as ''[[Non nobis]]'' is sung and the dead and wounded are carried off the field. Henry himself carries Robin.\n\n===Act 5===\nFinally negotiations are made for Henry to be named king of both England and France. While the French and English royal delegations negotiate the [[Treaty of Troyes]], the sides take a brief intermission in which Henry privately speaks with Katharine. He assures Kate that by marrying a French princess he demonstrates his respect for the people of France, and professes his love for her. The delegation returns and Henry announces a hopeful era of long peace with the joining of the two kingdoms. The film ends with Chorus detailing the history after the events of the film, culminating in the loss of the French throne by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Henry V of England|King Henry V of England]]\n* [[Paul Scofield]] as [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI, King of France]]\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Chorus\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Fluellen]], a Welsh officer in Henry's army\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as the [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]], uncle to the King\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[Catherine of Valois|Katharine, daughter of King Charles VI]]\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Mistress Quickly]], an innkeeper\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Robin, the luggage-boy\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Sir John Falstaff]], former friend of the King\n* [[Alec McCowen]] as the [[John Fordham|Bishop of Ely]]\n* [[James Larkin (actor)|James Larkin]] as the [[John, Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]], brother to the King\n* [[Simon Shepherd]] as the [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], brother to the King\n* James Simmons as the [[Edward, Duke of York|Duke of York]]\n* [[Charles Kay]] as the [[Henry Chichele|Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n* Paul Gregory as the [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmorland]]\n* [[Nicholas Ferguson]] as the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]]\n* Tom Whitehouse as [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|John Talbot]]\n* Fabian Cartwright as the [[Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge|Earl of Cambridge]]\n* Stephen Simms as [[Henry le Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham|Lord Scroop]]\n* Jay Villiers as Sir [[Thomas Grey (conspirator)|Thomas Grey]]\n* [[Edward Jewesbury]] as Sir [[Thomas Erpynham|Thomas Erpingham]], officer in Henry's army\n* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Daniel Webb]] as Gower, an English officer in Henry's army\n* [[Jimmy Yuill]] as Jamy, a Scottish officer in Henry's army\n* [[John Sessions]] as Macmorris, an Irish officer in Henry's army\n* [[Shaun Prendergast]] as Bates, soldier in Henry's army\n* [[Patrick Doyle|Pat Doyle]] as Court, soldier in Henry's army\n* [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as [[Michael Williams (Henry V)|Michael Williams]], soldier in Henry's army\n* [[Richard Briers]] as [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]], former friend of the King and lieutenant in his army\n* [[Geoffrey Hutchings]] as [[Corporal Nym|Nym]], former friend of the King and corporal in his army\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as [[Ancient Pistol|Pistol]], former friend of the King and ensign (using the old title \"ancient\") in his army\n* [[Michael Maloney]] as [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the Dauphin]]\n* Richard Clifford as [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]\n* [[Nigel Greaves]] as the [[John, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]]\n* Julian Gartside as the [[John V of Brittany|Duke of Bretagne]]\n* [[Harold Innocent]] as [[John the Fearless|Duke of Burgundy]]\n* [[Richard Easton]] as the [[Charles d'Albret|Constable of France]]\n* [[Colin Hurley]] as Grandpr\u00e9, a French lord\n* [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Alice, a lady attending on Katharine\n* [[David Lloyd Meredith]] as the Governor of Harfleur\n* [[Christopher Ravenscroft]] as [[Montjoy]], a French herald\n* [[David Parfitt]] as Messenger\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe text of the play is heavily edited. Additionally, Branagh incorporated [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] using extracts from ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'' in which Henry interacts with the character of [[Falstaff]], who, in Shakespeare's ''Henry V'', is never seen, merely announced to be deathly ill in Act 2 scene 1, and dead in Act 2 scene 3. The scenes involve a brief summary of Henry's denouncement of Falstaff primarily with lines from Act 2, scene 4 of ''Henry IV part 1'' and a brief though important utterance of Henry's final repudiation of Falstaff in ''Part 2'', \"I know thee not, old man.\" The film also uses Falstaff's line \"do not, when thou art King, hang a thief\" from ''Henry IV Part 1'' but gives it to Bardolph, in order to highlight the poignancy when Henry later has Bardolph executed.\n\n===Filming===\n''Henry V'' was made on an estimated budget of $9 million.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097499/business Henry V (1989) - Box office / business].  Retrieved 12 February 2012.</ref> The film was produced by Bruce Sharman with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and Branagh's company Renaissance Films. [[Principal photography]] commenced on 31 October 1988 and concluded 19 December the same year.  Sixty percent of production was shot on sound stages at [[Shepperton Studios]], while many of the battle sequences were shot on fields adjacent to the Shepperton complex.<ref>''Henry V'' DVD (2000). \"Collectable Booklet\".</ref>\n\n===Style===\nBranagh's film is frequently compared with the [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944 film of the play]] directed by and starring [[Laurence Olivier]]. The visual style of Branagh's film is grittier and more [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] than that of Olivier's. For example, his film avoids Olivier's use of stylized sets, and, where Olivier staged the [[Battle of Agincourt]] on a sunlit field, Branagh's takes place amid rain-drenched mud and gore.  Nearly all of the scenes involving the comic characters were also staged as drama, rather than in the broad, more [[slapstick]] way in which Olivier staged them, because Branagh felt that modern audiences would not see the humour in these scenes.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} There is also a historical inaccuracy in that [[Charles VI of France]] was played by 67-year-old [[Paul Scofield]], perhaps to enhance the effect of the historical king's mental illness that he had already been suffering for twenty years, but Charles VI was only 46 years old at the time of Agincourt. However, Olivier's movie also uses an older actor to play Charles VI ([[Harcourt Williams]], who was 66 years old at the time of filming).\n\nWhile the text of the Chorus' monologues are the same, the setting for them has been adapted to reflect the nature of the motion picture adaptation of the play.  Unlike the other performers, who are dressed in clothing contemporary to the actual Henry V to reflect their characters, the Chorus is dressed in modern 20th century clothing.  The opening monologue, originally written to compensate for the limitations of on stage theater to represent the historical scenes presented, is delivered on an empty motion picture [[sound stage]] with unfinished sets.  The other chorus monologues are delivered on location where the relevant action is taking place.  In all cases, the chorus speaks directly to the camera, addressing the audience.\n\n===Music===\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [https://www.allmusic.com/album/henry-v-r114078 link]\n| rev2 = [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]]\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/henry_v.html link]\n}}\nThe score to ''Henry V'' was written by then first-time film composer [[Patrick Doyle]].

To deliver this speech successfully is to pass the acid test for anyone daring to perform the role of Henry V in public, and as Kenneth Branagh, as Henry, stood up on the dawn of the Battle of Agincourt and delivered the famous words, I was emotionally stirred even though I had heard them many times before.
