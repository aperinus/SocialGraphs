Starring Gallo and [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], it tells the story of a motorcycle racer on a cross-country drive who is haunted by memories of his former lover. It was photographed with [[Hand-held camera|handheld]] [[16 mm film|16 mm]] cameras in various locations throughout the United States, including [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[California]]. Following a world premiere at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], the film garnered a great deal of media attention because of the explicit final scene, where Sevigny performs unsimulated [[fellatio]] on Gallo, as well as a feud between Gallo and the film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who stated that ''The Brown Bunny'' was the worst film in the history of Cannes,<ref>{{cite news|title=Review for The Brown Bunny|author=Roger Ebert|date=September 3, 2003|work=Chicago Sun-Times|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040903/REVIEWS/409020301/1023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040907034235/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040903/REVIEWS/409020301/1023 |archive-date=September 7, 2004}}</ref> although he later gave a re-edited version his signature \"[[Thumb signal|thumbs up]]\".<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-brown-bunny-2004 |title=The Brown Bunny Movie Review & Film Summary (2004) |access-date=January 31, 2014|work=rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMotorcycle racer Bud Clay undertakes a cross-country drive, following a race in New Hampshire, in order to participate in a race in California. All the while he is haunted by memories of his former lover, Daisy. On his journey he meets three women, but Bud seems to be a lost soul, and he is unable to form an emotional connection with any of them. He first meets Violet at a gas station in New Hampshire and convinces her to join him on his trip. They stop at her home in order to get her clothes, but he drives off as soon as she enters the house.\n\nBud's next stop is the home of Daisy's parents, the location of Daisy's brown bunny. Daisy's mother does not remember Bud, who grew up in the house next door, nor does she remember having visited Bud and Daisy in California. Next, Bud stops at a pet shelter, where he asks about the life expectancy of rabbits (he is told it is about five or six years). At a highway rest stop, he meets a distressed woman, Lilly. He comforts and kisses her, before starting to cry and eventually leaving her. Bud appears more distressed as the road trip continues, crying as he drives. He stops at the [[Bonneville Speedway]] to race his motorcycle. In [[Las Vegas]], he drives around prostitutes on street corners, before deciding to ask one of them, Rose, to join him for a lunch. She eats [[McDonald's]] food in his truck until he stops, pays her, and leaves her back on the street.\n\nAfter having his motorcycle checked in a Los Angeles garage, Bud stops at Daisy's house, which appears abandoned. He leaves a note on the door frame, after sitting in his truck in the driveway remembering about kissing Daisy in this place, and checks in at a hotel. Daisy eventually appears there. She seems nervous, going to the bathroom twice to smoke [[crack cocaine]], while Bud waits for her, sitting on his bed. As she proposes to go out to buy something to drink, Bud tells her that, because of what happened the last time they saw each other, he does not drink anymore.\n\nThey have an argument about Daisy kissing other men. At this point, Bud undresses Daisy and she [[fellatio|fellates]] him. Once done, he insults her as they lie in bed, talking about what happened during their last meeting. Bud continuously asks Daisy why she had been involved with some men at a party. She explains that she was just being friendly and wanted to smoke [[marijuana]] with them. Bud becomes upset because Daisy was pregnant and it transpires that the baby died as a result of what happened at this party.\n\nThrough flashback scenes, the viewer understands that Daisy was [[rape]]d at the party, a scene witnessed by Bud, who did not intervene. Daisy asks Bud why he did not help her, and his feelings of guilt on this are considerable. He tells her that he did not know what to do, and so he decided to leave the party. After he came back a bit later, he saw an ambulance in front of the house and Daisy explains to Bud that she is dead, having passed out prior to the rape and then choked to death on her own vomit. Bud awakens the next morning, alone; his encounter with Daisy turns out to have been a figment of his imagination. The movie ends as Bud is driving his truck in California.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Gallo]] as Bud Clay\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Daisy\n* [[Cheryl Tiegs]] as Lilly\n* Elizabeth Blake as Rose\n* Anna Vareschi as Violet\n* Mary Morasky as Mrs. Lemon\n\n==Production and release==\nThe film was shot in [[16 mm film|16 mm]] and then blown up in [[35mm movie film|35 mm]], which gives the photography a typical \"old-school grain\".<ref name=\"movies.about.com\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/thebrownbunny/a/bbunnyvg081904.htm|title=Filmmaker Vincent Gallo Discusses \"The Brown Bunny\"}}</ref> Vincent Gallo credited himself as director of the photography as well as one of the three camera operators along with Toshiaki Ozawa and John Clemens.\n\nThe version of the film shown in the U.S. has been cut by about 25 minutes compared to the version shown at Cannes, removing a large part of the initial scene at the race track (about four minutes shorter), about six minutes of music and black screen at the end of the film, and about seven minutes of driving before the scene in the [[Bonneville Speedway]].<ref name=\"movies.about.com\"/>\n\nNeither Anna Vareschi nor Elizabeth Blake, both in the film, were professional actresses.

A war of words then erupted between Gallo and film critic [[Roger Ebert]], with Ebert writing that ''The Brown Bunny'' was the worst film in the history of Cannes, and Gallo retorting by calling Ebert a \"fat pig with the physique of a [[slave trade]]r.\"<ref>Peretti, Jacques.

On the August 28, 2004 episode of the television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]'', Ebert gave the new version of the film a \"thumbs up\" rating. In a column published about the same time, Ebert reported that he and Gallo had made peace. According to Ebert:\n\n{{cquote|Gallo went back into the editing room and cut 26 minutes of his 118-minute film, or almost a quarter of the running time. And in the process he transformed it.
