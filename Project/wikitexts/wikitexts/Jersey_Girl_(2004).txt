It stars [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Liv Tyler]] with [[George Carlin]] (in his final onscreen film appearance before his death), [[Stephen Root]], [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]], [[Raquel Castro]], [[Jason Biggs]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] in supporting roles. The film follows a man who must take care of his precocious daughter after her mother dies in childbirth.\n\nIt was the first film written and directed by Smith not to be set in the [[View Askewniverse]] as well as the first not to feature appearances by [[Jay and Silent Bob]], although animated versions of them appear in the View Askew logo at the beginning of the film and the still version at the end. At $35 million, not including marketing costs, it was then Smith's biggest-budgeted film, and was a box office bomb, grossing just $36 million.<ref name=\"Masters\">{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-smith-alarmist-ninnies-misinterpreted-95811 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 3, 2011 |access-date=June 29, 2018 | first=Kim | last=Masters | title=Kevin Smith: 'Alarmist Ninnies' Misinterpreted Sundance Outburst}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPowerful [[New York City]] [[Mass media|media]] [[Public relations|publicist]] Ollie Trink\u00e9's wife, Gertrude, dies during childbirth due to an [[aneurysm]]. To avoid his grief, he buries himself in his work and ignores his new daughter, Gertie, while his father, Bart, whose own wife died many years earlier, takes a month off from work to take care of her, later returning to work to convince his son to live up to his responsibility as a single parent. Stressed by a crying baby, he insults his client, [[Will Smith]], in front of assembled reporters. He is consequently fired and moves back in with Bart in [[New Jersey]]. He eventually apologizes for ignoring Gertie and attributes his public outburst to his grief.\n\n[[Blacklisted]] by all of New York City's public relations firms, Ollie has to work as a civil servant in the [[borough (New Jersey)|borough]] where he now lives. Seven years later, Gertie, now in elementary school, often coaxes him to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya, a [[graduate student]] and one of the clerks, whose uninhibited probing into Ollie's love life almost leads to them having sex. She soon enters their lives.\n\nAs part of his job in the borough, Ollie speaks to a group of outraged citizens to win over their approval for a major public works project that will temporarily close a street in the neighborhood. His successful and enjoyable interaction with them makes him realize how much he misses public relations work. He contacts Arthur, his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who sets up a promising interview.\n\nThe prospect of moving back to New York City creates tension among Ollie, Gertie, Bart, and Maya, especially when he says that his interview is on the same day as Gertie's school talent show. She angrily yells at him for putting himself before her again, going as far as to say that she hates him and that she wishes he had died instead of her mother. He claims he hates her too, and says she and her mother took his life away and he just wants it back, which shocks everyone. Gertie tearfully runs to her room. A few days later, they reconcile, apologizing for their hurtful words, and she accepts that they will be moving to New York City. While waiting to be interviewed, he has a chance encounter with Will Smith. Smith is unaware who Ollie is, but their  conversation about work and children persuades Ollie to skip the interview and leave.\n\nOllie rushes to make it to Gertie's ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' performance at the last moment. The film ends with him, Gertie, Bart, Maya, and the rest celebrating at the bar. He and Maya hint at possible feelings for each other before Gertie interrupts them. He holds her in his arms and says that they are staying in New Jersey because he decided to not take the job. She asks why he did so if he loved it so much. He then says that he thought he did, but he loves his new life more because being a father to her was the only thing that he was ever really good at.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Ollie Trink\u00e9, the single father of little Gertie who lost his wife after the birth of his daughter.\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Maya Harding, a graduate student at college who works at the video store, Ollie's new girlfriend and a mother figure to little Gertie.\n* [[Raquel Castro]] as Gertie Trink\u00e9, Ollie's daughter who is named after Ollie's late wife and Maya's friend.\n* [[George Carlin]] as Bart Trink\u00e9, Ollie's father, who helps Ollie with Gertie\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Greenie, Bart's friend\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Block, Bart's friend\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Gertie Steiney-Trink\u00e9, Ollie's first wife who died when she gave birth to baby Gertie.\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Arthur Brickman \n* [[Paulie Litt]] as Bryan (''as Paulie Litowsky'')\n* [[Harley Quinn Smith]] as Trace Colelli\n* [[Betty Aberlin]] as the emcee at the school talent show \n;Cameos\n* [[Will Smith]] as himself\n* [[Matt Damon]] as PR Exec.\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as PR Exec.\n* [[S.
