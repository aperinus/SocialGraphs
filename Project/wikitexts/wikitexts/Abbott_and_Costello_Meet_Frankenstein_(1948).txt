The film features [[Count Dracula]] ([[Bela Lugosi]]) who has become partners with Dr. Sandra Mornay ([[Lenore Aubert]]), as Dracula requires a \"simple, pliable\" brain to reactivate [[Frankenstein's monster]] ([[Glenn Strange]]). Dracula discovers that the \"ideal\" brain belongs to Wilbur Grey ([[Lou Costello]]) who is wooed by Mornay to the operating table, despite the warnings of [[Lawrence Talbot]] ([[Lon Chaney Jr.]]).\n\nThe film was developed and began being made against the wishes of Abbott and Costello, with Costello specifically not liking the script. The film was made under difficulty according to director Barton who found Abbott and Costello often absent or not working on the set. On the film's release, it was one of Universal-Internationals' biggest films of the year and led to several follow-up films involving Abbott and Costello meeting other horror film actors and creatures. The film was well received by trade papers and West Coast American critics on its release but received poor reviews in New York. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed this film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] and later placed in at number 56 on the list of the [[American Film Institute]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Funniest American Movies]]\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Larry Talbot]] makes an urgent phone call to a railway station in Florida, where Chick Young and Wilbur Grey work as baggage clerks. Talbot tries to warn Wilbur of a shipment due to arrive for \"McDougal's House of Horrors\". However, before he finishes, the moon rises and Talbot transforms into a [[werewolf]], causing Wilbur to think the call is a prank. Meanwhile, McDougal demands the crates be personally delivered to his [[wax museum]].\n\nChick and Wilbur deliver the crates after hours. They open the first one and find [[Dracula]]'s coffin. When Chick leaves the room to retrieve the second crate, Wilbur reads the Dracula legend, and the coffin suddenly opens, and Dracula sneaks out. Wilbur is so frightened he can barely articulate his call for help. When Chick returns, he refuses to believe the story. The boys open the second crate, and Chick goes to greet McDougal. Dracula hypnotizes Wilbur, finds [[Frankenstein's Monster]] in the second crate, and reanimates him. Both leave, and McDougal finds the crates empty and has Wilbur and Chick arrested.\n\nThat night, Dr. Sandra Mornay welcomes Dracula and the Monster to her island castle. Sandra has seduced Wilbur as part of Dracula's plan to give the monster a more obedient brain. Meanwhile, Wilbur and Chick are bailed out of jail by Joan Raymond, an undercover insurance investigator who feigns love for Wilbur, hoping to gain information. Wilbur invites Joan to a [[masquerade ball]] that evening. Talbot takes the apartment across the hall from Wilbur and Chick and asks them to help him find and destroy Dracula and the Monster. Wilbur agrees, but Chick remains skeptical.\n\nWilbur, Chick and Joan go to Sandra's castle to pick her up for the ball. Wilbur answers a telephone call from Talbot, who informs them that they are in fact in the \"House of Dracula\". Wilbur reluctantly agrees to search the castle and soon stumbles upon a basement staircase, where he has a few close encounters with the monsters. Meanwhile, Joan discovers Dr. Frankenstein's notebook in Sandra's desk, and Sandra finds an Insurance Investigator ID in Joan's purse.\n\nDracula, under the alias of Dr. Lejos, introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle and attending the ball is the na\u00efve Professor Stevens, who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur says that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells the others to attend the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that she feels they are not safe to conduct the experiment. Dracula then turns her into a vampire.\n\nAt the masquerade ball, Talbot accuses Lejos of being Dracula, but no one takes him seriously. Joan soon disappears. Sandra lures Wilbur into the woods and attempts to bite him, but fails. While looking for Joan, Talbot becomes the Wolfman and attacks McDougal. Since Chick's costume is a wolf, McDougal accuses Chick, who escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur, Stevens, and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot meet up in the bayou and set out to rescue Wilbur and Joan.\n\nWilbur is quickly freed, but Dracula uses hypnotism to call him back. As Sandra prepares to cut into Wilbur's brain, Talbot and Chick burst in. Chick knocks out Sandra with a chair, and Talbot tries to free Wilbur but turns into the Wolfman again. Frankenstein's Monster breaks free of his bonds\u2014Sandra tries to control him, but he throws her out the window. After a chase through the house between Chick, Wilbur and the Monster and a face-off between Dracula and The Wolf Man, Dracula transforms into a [[Bat (animal)|bat]] but is pounced on by the Wolfman, who drags the two of them to their deaths. Chick and Wilbur escape in boats; while Joan and Stevens set the pier ablaze while the Monster is standing on it, and he dies in the flames.\n\nWilbur scolds Chick for his earlier skepticism, and Chick remarks they have nothing to fear now. [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]] addresses them from the boat's [[thwart]], and they flee the boat in terror.\n\n==Cast==\nCast adapted from the [[American Film Institute]]:<ref name=\"afi\" />\n{{castlist|\n* [[Bud Abbott]] as Chick Young\n* [[Lou Costello]] as Wilbur Grey\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot / The Wolf Man]]\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] / Dr. Lejos\n* [[Glenn Strange]] as the [[Frankenstein's monster|Monster]]\n* [[Lenore Aubert]] as Sandra Mornay\n* [[Jane Randolph]] as Joan Raymond\n* [[Frank Ferguson]] as Mr. McDougal\n* Charles Bradstreet as Dr. Stevens\n}}\nThe following cast went uncredited in the film:<ref name=\"afi\" />\n{{castlist|\n* [[Vincent Price]] as the voice of the Invisible Man\n* Bobby Barber as waiter at masquerade ball\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background and development===\nOn November 28, 1945, [[Universal Pictures]] joined with British entrepreneur [[J. Arthur Rank]], who bought one-fourth interest in the studio.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=14}} In 1946, Universal reported a profit of only $4.6&nbsp;million. They responded by dropping many actors from their contract roster, including Chaney.{{sfn|Mank|2020|p=72}} On July 31, 1946, an official merger began. The company, now called Universal\u2013International, had only [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Maria Montez]], [[Bud Abbott]] and [[Lou Costello]] and a few other actors remaining on their payroll.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Mank|2020|p=72}} Since the February 1941 release of ''[[Buck Privates]]'' starring Abbott and Costello, the duo were among the powerful stars at Universal.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=156}} By 1945, the duo nearly split up as they were fighting each other and suffered from their own personal issues: Abbott suffered from severe [[epilepsy]] and Costello had nearly died of rheumatic heart disease in 1943.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=156}}\n\nIn their first year of operation, the studio nearly went bankrupt.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=155}} In 1948, [[William Goetz]] had been in charge of production since Universal merged with International Pictures.{{sfn|Mank|1981|pp=155\u2013156}} In the same year, Abbott and Costello's popularity was also waning.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}} According to director [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]], who was among the top comedy film directors at Universal between 1945 and 1952, Goetz did not want anything to do with Abbott and Costello after [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] had dropped their option for more films from the team and [[Camel Cigarettes]] dropped their radio show in 1947.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Robert Arthur (film producer)|Robert Arthur]], a former writer and associate producer of MGM musicals along with veteran Abbott and Costello writers Frederic Rinaldo and [[Robert Lees]] developed a script that involved [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[Count Dracula]] and the [[Larry Talbot|Wolf Man]]. Their original script also included Kharis the Mummy, Dracula's son Alucard, and The Invisible Man.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}} Their script involved the Monster becoming Dracula's slave and the Count's search for the brain of a simpleton to be placed into the Monster's body, eventually settling on Lou Costello's brain.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}} Kharis, and Alucard were dropped from the script and the Invisible Man was only included as a small gag at the end of the film.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}} On reading their script initially titled ''The Brain of Frankenstein'', Lou Costello responded negatively stating \"You don't think I'll do that crap do you? My 5-year-old daughter can write something better than that\".{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}} ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' made the first public announcement of ''The Brain of Frankenstein'' in July 1947.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2178}}\n\nArthur felt strongly about the project and offered Costello a $50,000 advance on his percentage if he agreed do the film.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=157}}  Among the cast was [[Glenn Strange]], who had previously played the Monster in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945).{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=158}} Strange had only been in a handful of roles since that film, including [[Monogram]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Bandit]]'' (1946), [[Eagle-Lion]]'s ''[[Frontier Fighters]]'' (1947) and two for Universal: ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947) and another Abbott and Costello film, ''[[The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap]]'' (1947).{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=158}} Other actors were called back to reprise roles from previous Universal horror films, including [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]].{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=158}} Chaney had been doing stage work on ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[Born Yesterday (play)|Born Yesterday]]''.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=158}} Returning as Dracula was [[Bela Lugosi]], who had not worked in a Hollywood studio since 1946 with ''[[Scared to Death]]''.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=158}} Universal-International had Lugosi, Chaney, and Strange sign their contracts for the film on January 16, 1948.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2213}} Lugosi spoke positively about the role during production, glad that the script was not \"unbecoming to Dracula's dignity\" and that \"all I have to do is frighten the boys, a perfectly appropriate activity.

But I stood my ground with them, and so did Bob Arthur\".{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=159}} Barton continued that both the comedians would leave home several times during shooting the film, not show up, or spend about three days playing cards on set.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=159}} Abbott and Costello improvised some dialogue in the film.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2236}} Other script alterations were made in the film, such as a week within shooting when producer Robert Arthur decided to change the ending of the film to include a cameo by the Invisible Man.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2236}}\n\nThe film had a new make-up department opposed to the old one headed by [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack Pierce]].{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=159}} Emile LaVigne tended to Chaney's make-up while Jack Kevan worked on Glenn Strange.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=159}} Both Chaney and Strange required one hour each in the make-up chair in the morning before each set with much of Strange's make-up now being a rubber mask.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=159}} This saved approximately 100 total hours of production time on the film.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2223}} Strange later recalled that the set was \"one of the most enjoyable pictures I ever worked on\".{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=160}}\n\nAn accident on set nearly led the production to be briefly halted. In one scene, Strange was supposed to throw Lenore Aubert through a window. An invisible wire would be attached to her to help Strange lift her. When she was thrown, she swung back into camera range, motivating Strange to attempt to catch her, falling and breaking his foot in the process. As Strange's injury was being treated, Chaney took to applying the make-up and portrayed the monster throwing Aubert through the window.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=161}} By the end of February, the film's title had changed to one closer resembling its final release title.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2223}} Filming completed production on March 20, 1948.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=161}} A new scene was filmed after production wrapped with Jane Randolph on April 9.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2282}}\n\nPost-production started immediately on the film.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=161}}  [[Frank Skinner (composer)|Frank Skinner]], who had previously scored ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) and worked on the score of ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', (1941) composed the original score for the film.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=161-162}} Some effect shots were filmed in late March.{{sfn|Rhodes|Kaffenberger|2016|loc=2282}} Special effects for the film were developed by David Horsley and Jerome Ash.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=162}}  Special effects in the film included the bats that could be seen in the eyes of Miss Aubert and the animation that transformed Lugosi into a bat.{{sfn|Mank|1981|p=162}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bud Abbott in a crop from a promotional photograph for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein in 1948.png|thumb|left|upright|Bud Abbott in the film]]\nContemporary sources vary on the first release of ''Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein''.
