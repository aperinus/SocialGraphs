It stars [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Brooke Shields]]. The film's plot is a dark take on the fairy tale \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/reese-witherspoon-is-a-badass-little-red-riding-ho,91504 |title=Reese Witherspoon is a badass Little Red Riding Hood in the sordid, sleazy Freeway|website=[[The A.V.

Her mother, Ramona, is arrested in a [[prostitution]] sting, and her stepfather, Larry, is taken in on drug and child abuse charges. Social worker Mrs. Sheets comes to take Vanessa away, but she handcuffs the social worker to a bed and runs away.\n\nTaking Mrs. Sheets' run-down car, Vanessa plans to go live with her grandmother in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]. Along the way, she stops to see her boyfriend Chopper Wood, a local gang member, to tell him about her trip. He gives her a gun to sell upon arriving at her destination. Minutes after Vanessa leaves, he is killed in a drive-by shooting. Later, Bob Wolverton, a counselor at a school for boys with emotional problems, picks her up on the side of the highway when the car breaks down. He offers to take her as far as L.A., where he is headed.\n\nOver the long drive, Vanessa comes to trust Bob, and confesses to him the details of her painfully dysfunctional life, including sexual abuse by her stepfather and foster parents. At one point, Vanessa shows Bob a photo she keeps in her wallet of her biological father (whose picture, unbeknownst to her, is of [[mass murder]]er [[Richard Speck]]).\n\nThat evening, Bob attacks Vanessa, revealing he is the \"I-5 Killer\". She turns the tables on him, however, and shoots him several times before escaping. Going to a local restaurant, her blood-stained appearance prompts the owners to call 9-1-1. As she leaves the restaurant, Vanessa is arrested and questioned by police detectives, Mike Breer and Garnet Wallace, who write her off as a carjacker, even though she insists Bob had tried to kill her and had told her about his crimes.\n\nBob survives, but the bullet wounds have left him severely handicapped and facially disfigured. Vanessa is put on trial; Bob is portrayed as an innocent victim with no criminal record, whereas Vanessa has a long string of prior offenses. Vanessa goes to prison, while Bob and his socialite wife Mimi, who knows nothing of his crimes, are treated like heroes.\n\nInitially scared, Vanessa makes friends in prison that include [[heroin]]-addicted [[lesbian]] Rhonda and Mesquita, a brutal [[Hispanic]] gang leader. Vanessa plots to escape to her grandmother's house and fashions a shiv from a toothbrush, a skill she had learned from her stepfather. During their transport to a new maximum security prison, Vanessa and Mesquita escape after killing a security guard, and they go their separate ways.\n\nRe-examining evidence, the detectives realize Vanessa was telling the truth. They search Bob's home and find violent [[child pornography]] and human remains in a storage shed. Horrified, Mimi commits suicide. Evading the police at his home, Bob travels to Vanessa's grandmother's trailer, using the address written on a picture Vanessa had showed him.\n\nPosing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a car from a prospective [[Client (prostitution)|john]], driving to the trailer. She finds Bob in bed wearing her grandmother's nightgown and nightcap with the covers pulled up to his nose. He reveals himself and Vanessa sees her grandmother's dead body on the floor. A struggle ensues, culminating in her strangling him. Breer and Wallace arrive, finding the bodies of Bob and Vanessa's grandmother. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair in a daze, then asks the detectives if they have a cigarette. They all smile and laugh.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Robert \u201cBob\u201d Wolverton\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Vanessa Julia Lutz\n* [[Wolfgang Bodison]] as Detective Mike Breer\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Detective Garnet Wallace\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Ramona Lutz\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as Mimi Wolverton\n* [[Michael T.
