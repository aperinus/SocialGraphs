Written by [[Richard Wenk]], it stars [[Denzel Washington]] in the lead role, [[Marton Csokas]], [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[David Harbour]], [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Melissa Leo]]. The film focuses on a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] turned [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] [[intelligence officer]] who reluctantly returns to action to protect a [[human trafficking#Sex trafficking|teenage prostitute]] from members of the [[Russian mafia]]. [[Principal photography]] began in June 2013 in [[Massachusetts]]. ''The Equalizer'' had its world premiere at [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2014, and was released worldwide on September 26, 2014, in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters. \n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and audience who praised the visual style, direction, acting, soundtrack, and action sequences but criticized its screenplay, depictions of violence and plot. Nonetheless, it became a commercial success with a worldwide gross of over $192 million on a production budget of $55\u201373 million. A [[The Equalizer 2|sequel]] was released on July 20, 2018, with Denzel Washington, Richard Wenk, and Antoine Fuqua returning. A [[The Equalizer 3|third film]] is filming, with Washington and Fuqua returning.\n\n==Plot==\nRobert McCall lives a quiet, routine life in [[Boston]], working at a Home Mart hardware store. He helps his coworker Ralphie train to become a security guard, and often spends late nights reading at a diner where he befriends Alina, a teenage prostitute [[Human trafficking#Sex trafficking|trafficked]] by the [[Russian mafia]]. When Alina is badly beaten by her [[pimp]], Slavi, Robert visits her in the hospital and questions her friend, Mandy. He goes to Slavi's restaurant and offers to buy Alina's freedom, but Slavi refuses, leading Robert to expertly kill him and his men in a matter of seconds. \n\nSlavi's boss, powerful kingpin Vladimir Pushkin, sends his enforcer Teddy Rensen to find and eliminate the culprit. Rensen is reluctantly assisted by Frank Masters, a police detective on Pushkin's payroll, and viciously beats a rival [[Irish mob]]ster to death as a message from Pushkin. After forcing Mandy to tell him about meeting Robert, Rensen kills her, and finds security footage of Robert entering the restaurant. \n\nMeanwhile, Robert continues to [[vigilantism|take the law into his own hands]], intimidating a pair of corrupt cops into returning the money they extorted from Ralphie's mother and other business owners. After he and his coworker Jenny are robbed at gunpoint, Robert dispenses his own justice to the thief and anonymously returns Jenny's stolen ring. Rensen tracks down Robert at his apartment, unsuccessfully posing as a police officer. He later tries to abduct him, but Robert escapes and leaves a fake paper trail for Rensen and Masters, watching on hidden cameras as they search his apartment. \n\nRobert's old friend and [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] colleague Susan Plummer informs him that Slavi's crew was the East Coast hub of Pushkin's criminal operations, and \"Teddy Rensen\" is Nicolai Itchenko, a [[Spetsnaz]]-trained former member of the Russian [[secret police]]. Robert tortures Masters for information with [[Vehicular suicide#Suffocation|exhaust from his own car]], and forces him to help shut down one of Pushkin's money-laundering warehouses, leaving him to be arrested with Pushkin's men and millions in illicit cash. \n\nRobert obtains Masters' [[flash drive]] loaded with information about Pushkin's  activities, which he emails to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He confronts Nicolai, revealing that he knows his troubled history. Pledging to bring down Pushkin's empire, Robert destroys two of his oil tankers. Nicolai sends his men to the Home Mart, taking Ralphie and other employees hostage. Robert kills the henchmen one by one with improvised weapons and traps, rescuing his coworkers, and kills Nicolai with a [[nail gun]]. \n\nThree days later, Robert confronts Pushkin at his [[Moscow]] mansion, killing his guards and tricking him into electrocuting himself. Returning home, Robert is thanked by Alina, who has started a new life with money he anonymously left her. Inspired to continue using his skills to help people in need, Robert posts an online advertisement as ''The Equalizer''.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Robert McCall\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Nicolai Itchenko, a.k.a.
