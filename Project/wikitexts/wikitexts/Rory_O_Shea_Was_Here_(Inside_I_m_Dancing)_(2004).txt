The film revolves around two [[Disability|disabled]] young men who pursue physical and emotional independence in direct defiance of \"protective\" institutional living and their society's prevailing standards and attitudes, especially [[pity]].\n\nThe production was filmed in [[Dublin]] and [[Wicklow]] and involved production companies [[Working Title Films]] and [[StudioCanal]] with assistance from the [[Irish Film Board]] (''Bord Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann'').\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Connolly is a 24-year-old with [[cerebral palsy]] who is a long-term resident of the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled run by the formidable Eileen. His life, mundane and schedule-driven by the institution's authorities, is transformed when the maverick Rory O'Shea, who suffers from [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], suddenly moves in. Michael is stunned to discover that fast talking Rory, prone to lewd and/or overt jokes at unpredictable intervals, and who can move only his right hand, can understand his almost unintelligible speech. Rory's dynamic and rebellious nature soon sparks a flame in Michael, introducing him to the wider world outside of Carrigmore.\n\nOn a day out in Dublin led by Carrigmore collecting for \"the needs of the disabled\", Rory leads Michael astray, sneaking off to a local pub with their donation bucket, charming a group of girls at a corner table at which sits Siobh\u00e1n; later they see Siobh\u00e1n again while traversing a neighbouring [[nightclub]], which they get into only by Michael citing Irish and EU Disability Discrimination Law text to the [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]].\n\nRory has meanwhile repeatedly failed in his application for the Independent Living Allowance; he is always denied that on the grounds of irresponsibility and poor judgement, but told to reapply in six months. Inspired by his example Michael applies for the allowance himself; with the help of Rory as his interpreter Michael gets the allowance but they struggle to find an apartment that is both [[wheelchair accessible]] and affordable. Rory convinces Michael to visit his estranged father who, out of guilt, gives them the money and property they need to set up on their own.\n\nThey interview for a care-giver with little success, but later they meet Siobh\u00e1n working in a local supermarket, and try to convince her to take on the job. Despite not having any professional experience she reluctantly accepts. Seeing that Michael and Siobh\u00e1n are platonically friendly to each other, Rory becomes jealous \u2013 culminating in a [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]] with local kids in a stolen car, crashing it, subsequently getting briefly detained by the police.\n\nSiobh\u00e1n invites Rory and Michael along to a costume party; but after Siobh\u00e1n rejects Michaels advances she decides to bring in Peter, a qualified Personal Assistant to replace herself. Michael is distraught over Siobh\u00e1n's departure from their lives, and considering suicide; Rory finds him on the edge of the [[James Joyce Bridge]]. Michael jokingly complains the edge is too high for him to throw himself off, and Rory talks him out of it, reminding him he has a future and to enjoy it.\n\nLater, Michael finds Rory in his bed struggling to breathe, and calls for an ambulance. His disease having progressed, Rory is given only a few days to live. Michael visits Siobh\u00e1n and with her help goes to the review board on behalf of Rory to argue his case, another chance having come up after six months. The board initially refuse, restating the same arguments, however Michael responds that ''\"the right must exist independently of its exercising\"'' and as a gesture the board approve Rory's independent living allowance in principle \u2013 but before they can get to the hospital to tell Rory the news, he has already died.\n\nMichael and Siobhan attend Rory's funeral. Michael hears in his mind Rory's words ''\"Well, then, are we going out?\"'' and after saying goodbye to Siobhan, Michael heads out on his own.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Rory Gerard O'Shea, a rebellious young man with [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]\n* [[Steven Robertson]] as Michael Connolly, a 24-year-old long-term resident with cerebral palsy\n* [[Romola Garai]] as Siobh\u00e1n, a young woman they employ as a caregiver\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as Eileen, a domineering care worker at Michael's care home\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Fergus Connolly, Michael's father who abandoned him at birth\n* [[Tom Hickey (actor)|Tom Hickey]] as Con O'Shea, Rory's father\n* Alan King as Tommy\n* Ruth McCabe as Annie\n* Anna Healy as Alice\n* [[Deirdre O'Kane]] (''[[Cameo appearance|cameo]]'') as a caregiver applicant\n\n== Production ==\nWriter Christian O'Reilly came up with the story after working with Martin Naughton, and Dermot Walsh, on a campaign for the Centre for Independent Living in Dublin.<ref name=\"guardian-story\">{{cite news | title = The wheelchair diaries.
