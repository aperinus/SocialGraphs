Gary Gray]] and written by [[Ice Cube]] and [[DJ Pooh]]. The first installment in the [[Friday (franchise)|''Friday'' franchise]], the film stars Ice Cube, [[Chris Tucker]], [[Nia Long]], [[Bernie Mac]], [[Tommy Lister Jr.|Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister Jr.]], [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]], [[Regina King]], and [[Anna Maria Horsford]]. Set in [[South Central Los Angeles]], it follows unemployed friends Craig Jones and Smokey, who face troubles after becoming indebted to a local [[drug dealer]].\n\nWhile developing the film, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh expressed discontent regarding the portrayal of the [[hood film|hood in film]], which they came to see as violent and menacing. As a result, they wished to counteract this, drawing on personal experiences when crafting the characters and plot points. Preparations for the film began after the pair were able to secure funding from [[New Line Cinema]], who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles; Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker during casting. The film was Gray's film directorial debut, who was previously known as a [[music video]] director.\n\n''Friday'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 1995. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the comedic sequences, writing, and acting performances. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $27 million worldwide. It then obtained a large [[cult following]], inspiring [[internet meme]]s and pop-culture references. It launched a [[Friday (franchise)|media franchise]] with the sequels ''[[Next Friday]]'' (2000) and ''[[Friday After Next]]'' (2002), which have also gained a cult following despite their negative reviews.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\n==Plot==\nCraig Jones, a recently fired and unemployed [[slacker]], living in [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]], spends Friday with his best friend Smokey, a small-time drug peddler. The pair smoke a brokered consignment of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], which Smokey was tasked to sell for Smokey's drug supplier Big Worm. \n\nBig Worm attempts to collect his money from Smokey, who accidentally involves Craig, subjecting both to Big Worm's ultimatum: if they don't repay him $200 by 10:00 PM that evening, Craig and Smokey will be killed.\n\nCraig attempts to borrow money from a number of people, including his mother Betty, his sister Dana, and [[Domestic violence|abusive]] girlfriend Joi, whom the latter refuses under the assumption that Craig is being unfaithful with local [[Addiction|drug addict]] and [[Begging|beggar]] Felisha. Craig retrieves a gun to walk Smokey home, but his father Willie tells him that he needs to use his fists instead of weapons to help himself.\n\nSmokey sells some drugs to Hector, a former smoking buddy, while Deebo, the neighborhood bully, forces Smokey to break into their neighbor Stanley's house to burglarize in which they manage to steal $200, that Deebo decides to keep for himself.\n\nSmokey attempts to retrieve the money from Deebo, who is asleep with Felisha at her house, but fails due to interference from the petty thief Ezal. Seeing Deebo awake, Craig and Smokey notice a car driving slowly and, suspecting a [[drive-by shooting]], they hide in Craig's room for the evening. After failing to contact Big Worm, and with 10:00 PM approaching, they return outside, but are forced to evade Big Worm's men as they're sitting in a black van with its headlights off, starting a shootout.\n\nAfter the shootout, the neighbors come out of their houses upon hearing the gunshots. Debbie confronts Deebo for beating Felisha, assuming Felisha was behind Smokey's attempted theft. As Craig and Smokey arrive, Deebo angrily punches Debbie, knocking her to the ground, leading to a physical altercation between him and Craig, with Craig being victorious. Smokey steals the $200 from the incapacitated Deebo. \n\nOther locals, such as Red and Ezal, retrieve their stolen items. Debbie tends to Craig's wounds, leading him to break up with Joi on the phone, while his father informs him his former supervisor called wanting to see him tomorrow.\n\nSmokey settles his debt with Big Worm, telling him he will no longer sell drugs and is set to enter [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]]. Smokey then smokes a joint and ends the movie by [[Fourth wall|looking at the camera]] and saying \"I was just bullshittin'! And you know this, man!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Craig Jones, a slacker.\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Smokey, Craig's friend who is a drug peddler.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 December 2021 |title=Ice Cube reveals the sobering reason Chris Tucker didn't appear in 'Friday' sequels |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-12-30/ice-cube-chris-tucker-friday-sequels |website=Los Angeles Times }}</ref>\n* [[Nia Long]] as Debbie, a neighborhood girl.\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Pastor Clever\n* [[Tommy Lister Jr.|Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister Jr.]] as Deebo, the neighborhood bully.\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Willie Jones, an animal control officer and Craig & Dana\u2019s tough but well meaning father.\n* [[Regina King]] as Dana Jones, the sister of Craig.\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Betty Jones, the wife of Willie and the mother of Craig and Dana.\n* [[Paula Jai Parker]] as Joi, the abusive girlfriend of Craig.\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Big Worm, a drug supplier that Smokey works for.\n* [[DJ Pooh]] as Red, one of Craig's neighbors whose bicycle was stolen by Deebo.\n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|Anthony Johnson]] as Ezal, a petty thief\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] as Mr. Parker\n* [[Kathleen Bradley]] as Mrs. Parker\n* [[Yvette Wilson]] as Rita\n* Angela Means as Felisha<!-- The character's name is Felisha, NOT Felicia, even though the meme is usually \"Bye Felicia!\" -->, a drug addict.\n* [[Vickilyn Reynolds]] as Joann, Smokey's mother.\n* [[Demetrius Navarro]] as Hector, Smokey's smoking buddy.\n* [[Reynaldo Rey]] as Red's father\n* Ronn Riser as Stanley, one of Craig's neighbors.\n* Justin Renover as Kid #1\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Kid #2\n* [[Terri J.

Ice Cube and DJ Pooh felt that these films did not portray the full picture of living in the hood, missing a more lighthearted element, with Ice Cube later saying, \"we had fun in the hood.

According to Means, \"by the time that spaghetti was gone, Chris was Smokey.\"<ref name=\"Oralhistory\" />\n\nIce Cube was granted license to select the film's director, and decided on [[F. Gary Gray]], who was a [[music video]] director. Gray had previously worked with Ice Cube on a number of occasions, and was also aiming to establish a foothold in Hollywood through a short film. Ice Cube instead offered him the role for ''Friday'', attracted to the fact that he and Gray had similar backgrounds, feeling the director would accurately capture the film's aesthetic.<ref name=\"Oralhistory\" />\n\nGray said that Ice Cube starring in a comedy \"scared the shit out of me,\" as he doubted whether audiences would buy into Cube portraying a role so different from his public persona.
