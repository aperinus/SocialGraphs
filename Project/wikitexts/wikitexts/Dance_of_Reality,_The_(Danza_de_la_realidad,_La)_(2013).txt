Jaime is a [[communist]] who worships [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and raises his son with great severity. Sara sings rather than talks throughout the film, and believes Alejandro to be the reincarnation of her father because of his long blonde hair. Irritated by his wife's delusional views of their son and angered by Alejandro's behavior, which he views as cowardly and effeminate, Jaime cuts off Alejandro's hair (which is depicted as a wig in what appears to be [[magic realism]]), demands he repudiate the existence of God, and puts him through tests of self-control and bravery which include withstanding being tickled, slapped, and finally undergoing a dental operation without anesthetic. Satisfied with his son's bravery, Jaime acknowledges that he respects Alejandro and arranges for him to be made the mascot of the Tocopilla fire brigade.\n\nAlejandro accompanies the fire brigade to the scene of a fire where one of the firemen becomes trapped in the house and burns to death. During the subsequent funeral procession, Alejandro imagines himself lying in the casket with the fireman\u2019s corpse, and collapses from fright. Jaime takes him home, but burns the mascot's uniform in front of Alejandro when he wakes up, again calling his son a coward and claiming he is ashamed of him. In an attempt to prove his own bravery to the other firefighters, who he fears look down on him because of his son's cowardice and his Jewish heritage, Jaime attempts to distribute water to plague victims quarantined outside the town, but they kill and eat his donkeys and he himself is infected. He walks back to his shop, visibly infected, and a stand-off with the army ensues. As Jaime goes into convulsions and the army threaten to burn the shop to contain the infection, Sara prays for Jaime's recovery and urinates on him, curing him.\n\nEnergized by his miraculous recovery, Jaime plans to assassinate the right-wing president [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]] (Bastian Bodenhofer). He agrees to work with another communist to assassinate Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez at a dog show, but the gun fails and Jaime passes himself off as a hero when he jumps between Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and the gunman. To get close to Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Jaime asks for a job as groom to the president's beloved horse [[Bucephalus]] as payment for his heroism. Jaime then poisons Bucephalus as part of his plot to kill Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, but when Jaime has Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez at gunpoint, his hands become [[paralysed]].\n\nThe story returns to Alejandro and Sara, and Sara begins teaching Alejandro how not to be afraid of darkness and how to make sure people don't notice him. She tells him that she knows in her heart that Jaime is alive and loves both of them. They tie a stone to a balloon and release it in the belief it will find its way to him. The rock is then shown falling on the roof of a shack which Jaime is living in. Jaime awakes to discover that he has lost his memory, that he is living with a diminutive peasant woman, and that his arms have been painted the colors of the Chilean flag.\n\nJaime begins a long journey home, but is captured by [[Nazis]] and tortured. Rebels free Jaime and return him to his family in Tocopilla. Jaime's hands are healed when Sara tells him \"You found in Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez all you admired in Stalin. You are the same as they are! You have lived in the guise of a tyrant.\" Alejandro, Jaime, and Sara board a ship and leave [[Tocopilla]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] (Alejandro Jodorowsky's eldest son of four) as Jaime Jodorowsky\n* Pamela Flores as Sara Jodorowsky\n* Jerem\u00edas Herskovits (Alejandro Jodorowsky's grandson) as Young Alejandro\n* [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] as Old Alejandro\n* [[Basti\u00e1n Bodenh\u00f6fer]] as Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez\n* Andr\u00e9s Cox as Don Aquiles\n* [[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]] (Alejandro Jodorowsky's youngest son) as Anarchist\n* [[Axel Jodorowsky|Crist\u00f3bal Jodorowsky]] (Alejandro Jodorowsky's son) as Theosophist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danceofrealitymovie.com/?p=118|title=About The Dance of Reality|work=The Dance of Reality|accessdate=August 8, 2014|archive-date=10 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810103044/http://danceofrealitymovie.com/?p=118|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Luz Jim\u00e9nez (actress)|Luz Jim\u00e9nez]] como Queen of cups\n* [[Marcelo Alonso]] as Nazi boss\n* Sebasti\u00e1n Layseca as Nazi speaker\n* Nicol\u00e1s Saavedra as policeman \n* Paulina Hunt\n* Andr\u00e9s Skoknic as torturer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter scouting for locations in Chile at his childhood village in early 2011, Alejandro Jodorowsky received permission from the local Chilean government to shoot in the coming spring.
