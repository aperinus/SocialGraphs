G. Daily|Elizabeth Daily]], [[Cameron Dye]] and [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]].\n\n''Valley Girl'' was released in the United States on April 29, 1983.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=filmsearch_exact&dept=Film&movieID=4112|title=Variety: Digital Editions|publisher=Variety.com|access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref> The plot is based loosely on Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/making_valleygirl.htm|title=Making of Valley Girl \u2013 Behind the Scenes|publisher=fast-rewind.com|access-date=2009-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJulie Richman is a [[Valley girl]] who seems to have it all: good looks, popularity, and a handsome Valley dude boyfriend, Tommy, but she is having second thoughts about her relationship with the arrogant and selfish Tommy. At the end of a shopping trip with her friends, Loryn, Stacey, and Suzi, Julie runs into Tommy and breaks up with him. Later that day at the beach, Julie trades shy glances with a young man in the distance.\n\nThat night, at a party at Suzi's house, Julie locks eyes with Randy, a Hollywood [[Punk subculture|punk]] who has crashed the party with his friend Fred. They hit it off, especially after Julie learns Randy was the young man at the beach. Tommy is jealous, and tries to bed Loryn. He fails and gets his cronies to eject Randy and Fred from the party. Undaunted, Randy sneaks back into the house and hides in an upstairs bathroom shower. Randy waits in the shower for Julie to enter the bathroom as various party goers come and go, talking about and trying to have sex, and doing drugs. When Julie enters, Randy convinces her to leave the party with him. Julie brings a reluctant Stacey for the ride with Randy and Fred. While at Randy's favorite Hollywood nightclub, Julie and Randy rapidly grow closer as Stacey continually rebuffs Fred's advances. Julie ignores Stacey's plight and the fact that she never wanted to be there or with Fred.\n\nJulie's friends, dismayed by her relationship with Randy, pressure her to get back together with Tommy. Julie asks her father for advice, and he kindly tells her she should follow her heart. Despite this, Julie reconciles with Tommy and later dumps Randy. A heartbroken Randy gets severely drunk, makes out with his ex-girlfriend, and nearly gets into a fight with a gang of [[lowrider#Description of the subculture|low riders]] before Fred saves him. Fred chides Randy for moping over Julie, but tells him he needs to fight if he truly wants her back. After Randy flits about the Valley for the next few days just so he can get a glimpse at Julie, Fred says he has a plan that will reunite Randy with Julie as well as get revenge against Tommy.\n\nA subplot involves Suzi and her stepmother Beth vying for the attention of a boy named Skip. At her party, Suzi tells Beth, who is chaperoning, about Skip, whom she likes and hopes will show up. When Skip arrives, Beth is attracted to him. Skip also is attracted to Beth and goes out of his way to see her without Suzi's finding out. One day, Skip enters Suzi's house, apparently looking for Beth. He goes upstairs and finds a woman in the shower in Beth's bedroom. Skip and this woman, whose face is not shown, are then shown making love. Another woman arrives home and goes upstairs. The bedroom door opens, Beth enters, and only then it is shown Suzi was in the shower and in bed with Skip. Skip and Suzi go to the prom together.\n\nAs the girls make prom decorations, Stacey and Loryn chat over their post-prom plans. Stacey reveals Tommy made a reservation at the Valley Sheraton Hotel as an after-prom \"surprise\" for Julie.\n\nTommy and Julie ride to the prom in a rented stretch limousine; Randy and Fred arrive shortly after and sneak backstage. Randy increasingly becomes annoyed with watching the Valley High kids dance, but Fred assures him all is going according to plan. Julie and Tommy are escorted backstage, waiting to be introduced as king and queen of the prom. Randy confronts Tommy, and the two begin to brawl. When the prom king and queen are announced, the curtain pulls back to reveal Randy's beating up Tommy. Randy knocks Tommy out, then escorts a thrilled Julie from the stage through the crowd. Tommy recovers and storms through the crowd toward Randy and Julie, who start a food fight to slow Tommy down and facilitate their escape from the venue in Tommy's rented limousine.\n\nAs the happy couple ride into the night toward the Valley Sheraton, Julie removes Tommy's ID bracelet, which had been a sign of the relationship between the two during the entire film, and throws it out the window.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Randy\n* [[Deborah Foreman]] as Julie\n* [[E.

The camera then pans over the Hollywood Hills and the iconic Hollywood Sign to a wide-angle shot of the San Fernando Valley, setting up a recurring compare and contrast theme between the San Fernando Valley culture of the eighties versus the grittier culture of Hollywood and central Los Angeles.\n\nCage and Foreman found it difficult to do the breakup scene at Julie's front door because it was shot late in the filming when Cage and Foreman were dating. It took several takes and some counseling by Martha Coolidge. She told Foreman to think of another guy she had broken up with.<ref>''Running Audio Commentary by Martha Coolidge'', on the DVD</ref>\n\nThe film reunites [[Colleen Camp]] and [[Frederic Forrest]], who appeared together in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s   \n''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), and had a memorable sex scene together in the 2001 re-edit, ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Valley Girl'' was released on April 29, 1983, and opened in 442 theaters. In the opening weekend, it grossed $1,856,780 at #4. The final domestic gross reached $17,343,596.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film garnered mostly positive reviews; Rotten Tomatoes currently reviews an 83% 'Fresh' rating based on 29 reviews, noting \"With engaging performances from its two leads, ''Valley Girl'' is a goofy yet amiable film that both subverts and celebrates the cheerful superficiality of teen comedies.\"<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes | id=m/1022473_valley_girl | title=Valley Girl}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 66 based on 10 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/valley-girl-1983|title= Valley Girl (1983) Reviews|website=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Valley Girl (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|1983}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     = \n| genre      = [[New wave music|New Wave]]\n| length     = \n| label      = Roadshow\n| producer   = \n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack features a host of [[New wave music|new wave]] recording artists including the [[Psychedelic Furs]] as well as [[the Plimsouls]] and [[Josie Cotton]], both of whom appeared in the film. Songs by [[Bonnie Hayes]], [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]], and [[Payolas]] also featured prominently.\n\nMany of the songs used were minor chart hits in 1982\u201383. Josie Cotton's \"[[Johnny Are You Queer?]]\" was a regional hit in Southern California in 1981, placing #5 on [[KROQ-FM]]'s Top 106 songs of the year and \"He Could Be the One\" from her album ''Convertible Music'' had reached #74 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1982. The song heard over the opening credits is \"Girls Like Me\" from [[Bonnie Hayes]]' 1982 album ''Good Clean Fun'', which \"bubbled under\" the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart at #206. [[The Plimsouls]]' \"A Million Miles Away\" and the Payolas' \"Eyes of a Stranger\" were moderate hits in 1982, reaching #11 and #22, respectively, on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Tracks]] chart. \"[[I Melt with You]]\" by [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]] reached #78 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1983.\n\nThe song \"I Melt with You\" occurred twice in the film: in the ending credits and in the love scene montage. Director Martha Coolidge heard it on the radio and decided it caught the spirit of the film. She had to call the staff at the station and sing it to them to find out what it was called because they didn't announce what songs were after they were played.<ref>Director's running commentary on the film in the DVD</ref>\n\nThe end credits show songs by [[the Clash]], [[Culture Club]], [[Bananarama]], and [[the Jam]], but these songs are not heard in the film. After the film was completed, problems arose in acquiring the music rights and substitute songs had to be dubbed. Altogether the music rights cost $250,000 on top of the film's original $350,000 budget.<ref>Occhiogrosso, Peter. \"Reelin' and Rockin'\" ''American Film'' April 1984: 48</ref><ref>''American Film'' September 1984: 6</ref>\n\nThe planned release of a soundtrack album on [[Epic Records]] (catalog number FE 38673) was cancelled due to the clearance problems with some of the songs. Instead, a different six-song [[mini-album]] was manufactured by Roadshow Records, a one-off subsidiary of [[Atlantic Releasing]]. The album never was released commercially, but a few copies were leaked and became highly valued collector's items. More common is a counterfeit copy which is distinguished by the misspelling of the title as \"Valley Girls\" on the spine of the album cover.<ref>Osborne, Jerry. \"Valley Girl Music Battle Was Awesome\" ''Chicago Sun-Times'' December 2, 1990</ref><ref>Barker, Lisa. \"Valley Girl: A Totally Bitchin' Soundtrack That's Worth Like A Lot\" ''Goldmine'' November 27, 1992: 66</ref>\n\nIn 1994, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released a compilation of songs from the film's soundtrack on CD, which peaked at #155 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. This was followed by a second volume titled ''More Music from the Valley Girl Soundtrack'' in 1995.\n\nThe film originally carried the song \"[[Who Can It Be Now?]]\" by [[Men at Work]] in the scene where Randy hides in the shower hoping Julie will come in, but in the special edition DVD release, the song \"Systematic Way\" ([[Josie Cotton]]) carries over into the next scene.\n\n===Track listing===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;US mini-LP ''Valley Girl (Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' (Roadshow, 1983)\n# \"Girls LIke Me\" - [[Bonnie Hayes]] With The Wild Combo\n# \"Angst In My Pants\" - [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]\n# \"School Is In\" - [[Josie Cotton]]\n# \"Everywhere At Once\" - [[The Plimsouls]]\n# \"[[Johnny Are You Queer?]]\" - Josie Cotton\n# \"Shelly's Boyfriend\" - Bonnie Hayes With The Wild Combo\n\n;UK LP ''Valley Girl (The Original Soundtrack Album)'' (Avatar Communications, 1984)\n# \"[[I Melt With You]]\" - [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]]\n# \"Girls LIke Me\" - Bonnie Hayes With The Wild Combo\n# \"[[Love My Way (song)|Love My Way]]\" - [[The Psychedelic Furs]]\n# \"School Is In\" - Josie Cotton\n# \"Everywhere At Once\" - The Plimsouls\n# \"[[Who Can It Be Now?]]\" - [[Men At Work]]\n# \"Shelly's Boyfriend\" - Bonnie Hayes With The Wild Combo\n# \"She Talks To Me In Stereo\" - [[Gary Myrick]]\n# \"Johnny Are You Queer?\" - Josie Cotton\n{{col-2}}\n;CD ''Valley Girl (Music From The Soundtrack)'' (Rhino, 1994)\n# \"A Million Miles Away\" - The Plimsouls - 3:44\n# \"Johnny, Are You Queer?\" - Josie Cotton - 2:46\n# \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" - [[Payolas|Payola$]] \u2013 3:33\n# \"Angst In My Pants\" - Sparks \u2013 3:30\n# \"Who Can It Be Now?\" - Men At Work \u2013 3:23\n# \"Everywhere At Once\" - The Plimsouls \u2013 3:19\n# \"I La La La Love You\" - [[Pat Travers]]' Black Pearl \u2013 3:37\n# \"He Could Be The One\" - Josie Cotton \u2013 2:48\n# \"Love My Way\" - The Psychedelic Furs \u2013 3:40\n# \"Jukebox (Don't Put Another Dime)\" - The Flirts \u2013 3:45\n# \"The Fanatic\" - [[Felony (band)|Felony]] \u2013 3:36\n# \"She Talks In Stereo\" - Gary Myrick & The Figures \u2013 4:00\n# \"Oldest Story In The World\" - The Plimsouls \u2013 3:22\n# \"School Is In\" - Josie Cotton \u2013 2:34\n# \"I Melt With You\" - Modern English \u2013 3:48\n\n;CD ''Valley Girl (More Music From The Soundtrack)'' (Rhino, 1995)\n# \"Girls Like Me\" - Bonnie Hayes with The Wild Combo \u2013 3:02\n# \"Eaten By The Monster Of Love\" - Sparks \u2013 3:01\n# \"[[Mickey (Toni Basil song)|Mickey]]\" - [[Toni Basil]] \u2013 3:28\n# \"Zero Hour (Original Version)\" - The Plimsouls \u2013 2:35\n# \"[[He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'#Bananarama version|He Was Really Sayin' Somethin']]\" - [[Bananarama]] \u2013 3:46\n# \"[[In the Name of Love (Thompson Twins song)|In The Name Of Love]]\" - [[Thompson Twins]] \u2013 3:20\n# \"The Earthquake Song\" - [[The Little Girls]] \u2013 2:33\n# \"[[Do You Really Want to Hurt Me]]\" - [[Culture Club]] \u2013 4:24\n# \"[[Cool Places]]\" - Sparks & [[Jane Wiedlin]] \u2013 3:25\n# \"[[Town Called Malice]]\" - [[The Jam]] \u2013 2:56\n# \"I Eat Cannibals\" - [[Total Coelo]] \u2013 3:33\n# \"Time To Win\" - Gary Myrick & The Figures \u2013 4:05\n# \"Voo Doo\" - [[Rachel Sweet]] \u2013 3:39\n# \"Marina Men\" - Valley Girls \u2013 4:26\n# \"Pocket Pool\" - [[Killer Pussy]] \u2013 4:18\n# \"Shelly's Boyfriend\" - Bonnie Hayes with The Wild Combo \u2013 3:38\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Home media==\n''Valley Girl'' is available on DVD. The special edition DVD contains many extras, including the option of a running commentary by director Martha Coolidge, and interviews with many of the cast and crew, including Cage, Bowen, Holicker, Case, and Daily. For whatever reason, Deborah Foreman (Julie) is noticeably absent from this. In the DVD documentary, Daily admits that she had no idea what Valley Girls were supposed to sound like and decided that Loryn would be from Malibu, California (and therefore not a true Valley Girl) in order to cover this up; she later provided the singing voice of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''{{'s}} [[List of Two and a Half Men characters#Main|Jake Harper]] who splits his time between his parents' homes in Malibu and the Valley.\n\n[[Shout Factory]] released ''Valley Girl'' on Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/valley-girl-1983-blu-ray-coming-from-shout-factory.357627/|title=Valley Girl (1983) (Blu-ray) coming from Shout Factory| website=hometheaterforum.com|access-date=13 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.shoutfactory.com/shop?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiI-prrbH2wIVA5N-Ch1vFgqTEAAYASAAEgLAlPD_BwE|title=Shout!
