The film stars [[Helen Slater]] as Supergirl, along with [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Peter Cook]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], and [[Peter O'Toole]], with [[Marc McClure]] reprising his role as [[Jimmy Olsen]] from the ''Superman'' films.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 1984 and in the United States on 21 November 1984, but failed to impress critics and audiences alike,<ref>{{cite news|author=Maslin, Janet|title=The Screen: Helen Slater as 'Supergirl'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=22 November 1984|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/22/movies/the-screen-helen-slater-as-supergirl.html|access-date=9 October 2010}}</ref> while also underperforming at the box-office. Dunaway and O'Toole earned [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]], respectively. However, Slater was nominated for a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]]. The film's failure ultimately led producers [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] to sell the Superman film rights to [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] in 1986.\n\nIts first [[DVD]] release was by the independent home video company [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 2000, under license from then-rights holder [[StudioCanal]]. [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] acquired the rights to the film and reissued it on DVD late in 2006 to coincide with the release of ''[[Superman Returns]]''. Although it is [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] with the [[Christopher Reeve]] ''Superman'' films, it is not included in any of the ''Superman'' DVD or [[Blu-ray]] box sets by Warner Bros.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Supergirl (1984 film character)|Kara Zor-El]], cousin of [[Superman|Kal-El/Superman]] and Jor-El's niece, lives in [[Argo City]], an isolated Kryptonian community that survived the planet's destruction by being transported into a pocket of trans-dimensional space, the Survival Zone. A man named Zaltar allows Kara to see a unique and immensely powerful item known as the Omegahedron, which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city government, and which powers the city. However, a mishap leads to the Omegahedron being rocketed into space. Taking a ship, Kara follows it to Earth (undergoing a transformation into \"Supergirl\" in the process) to recover it and save the city.\n\nOn Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena, a power-hungry would-be [[witch]] assisted by the feckless Bianca, seeking to free herself from a relationship with [[warlock]] Nigel. Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes the Omegahedron is powerful and can give her true magic. Supergirl arrives on Earth and is granted new powers by its environment and the radiation of its sun. While seeking the Omegahedron, she creates the cover identity Linda Lee, cousin of [[Clark Kent]], and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane, the younger sister of [[Lois Lane]] who happens to be studying there. Supergirl also meets and becomes enamored with Ethan, a school [[Groundskeeping|groundskeeper]].\n\nEthan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion which will make him fall in love with the first person he sees for a day. Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle to retrieve Ethan, causing chaos as it does so. Supergirl, in the guise of Linda, rescues Ethan, and he falls in love with her instead.\n\nSupergirl and Selena proceed to battle. Selena captures Ethan, then traps Supergirl and sends her to the [[Phantom Zone]], a prison dimension. Now powerless, Supergirl wanders the bleak landscape and nearly drowns in an oily bog. Eventually, she encounters Zaltar...who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron. Zaltar helps Kara to escape, sacrificing his life to do so. Back on Earth, Selena uses the Omegahedron to make herself a \"princess of Earth\" with Ethan as her lover and [[:wikt:consort|consort]].\n\nEmerging from the Phantom Zone through a mirror, Supergirl regains her powers and confronts Selena, who uses the Omegahedron to summon a gigantic shadow demon. The demon is on the verge of defeating Supergirl when she hears Zaltar's voice urging her to fight on. Supergirl breaks free and Nigel tells her the only way to defeat Selena is to turn the demon against her. Supergirl complies and creates a focused whirlwind that traps Selena, who is then attacked and incapacitated by the demon as the whirlwind pulls in Bianca as well. The three are sucked through the mirror portal, which promptly reforms, trapping them all forever. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda, knowing she and Supergirl are one and the same. He also understands she must save Argo City and that he may not see her again. The final scene shows Kara returning the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which then lights up again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Helen Slater]] as [[Supergirl (1984 film character)|Kara Zor-El / Linda Lee / Supergirl]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Pantozzi, Jill|title=Helen Slater is Still \"Super\"|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=7 December 2009|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23956|access-date=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Selena\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Zaltar \n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Ethan\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura In-Ze]]\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Bianca\n* [[Peter Cook]] as Nigel\n* [[Simon Ward]] as [[Zor-El]]\n* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]\n* [[Maureen Teefy]] as [[Lucy Lane]]\n* [[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]] as Mr. Danvers\n* [[Sandra Dickinson]] as Pretty Young Lady\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Eddie, The Truck Driver\n* [[Kelly Hunter]] as Argonian Citizen\n* [[Glory Annen]] as Midvale Protester\n* [[Bradley Lavelle]] as Lucy's Friend\n\n===Cast notes===\n[[Christopher Reeve]] was slated to have a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as [[Superman]] but bowed out early on.<ref>''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman (Redemption)'', Warner Home Video, 2006.</ref> His non-appearance in the film is explained via a news broadcast (overheard by Selena) stating that Superman has left Earth on a \"peace-seeking mission\" to a distant galaxy. In the Superman documentary ''You Will Believe...,'' Director Jeannot Szwarc said Reeve's involvement in this film would have given the feature higher credibility, and admitted he wished Reeve had made a contribution to the film's production. A publicity photo of him as Superman does appear as a poster in Lucy and Linda's shared dorm room.\n\n[[Marc McClure]] makes his fourth of five appearances in the ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]''-related films; he is the only actor to appear in all four films featuring Superman and this spin-off film.

The entire film was shot, edited and overseen under the supervision of Warner Bros. and originally scheduled to be released in July 1984.

By this time [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] had assumed the video rights, where it was re-issued on VHS in 1998 as the \"114-minute cut\" under the ''Anchor Bay Entertainment Family Movies'' label. For their DVD release on August 8, 2000, two versions were issued. The first of these was a 2-disc \"Limited Edition\" set (limited to 50,000 copies only) featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\" (never seen in the United States, which was digitally mastered by [[THX]] for this DVD release), along with a 138-minute \"director's cut\", which had been discovered in StudioCanal's archives. The second version was a single-disc version featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\", with many bonus features: a 16-page full color booklet; Audio Commentary with Director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Michael Bosco; \"The Making of Supergirl\" Featurette; U.S. & Foreign Theatrical Trailers; U.S. TV Spots; Original Storyboards; Still & Poster Galleries; and Talent Bios (these extra features were also available on the 2-disc \"Limited Edition\" set). Anchor Bay re-issued a new VHS release once again, this time the 124-minute \"International Version\" coinciding with the DVD release, both a separate fullscreen and [[widescreen]] editions (widescreen version labeled as the \"Collector's Edition\") under different packaging artwork and digitally mastered by [[THX]]. The \"Director's Cut\" DVD was made from the last print known to exist of the cut, which was apparently prepared for possible television broadcast before the film was edited into its various versions. This longer version was never broadcast on network television in the United States, though it is believed to have been distributed in [[television syndication|syndication]] worldwide.\n\nIn 2002, Anchor Bay re-issued the 138 minute \"Director's Cut\" separately.<ref>{{cite news|title=Supergirl Limited Edition|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|date=25 August 2000|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/972/supergirl-limited-edition/|access-date=12 October 2010}}</ref> In November 2006, coinciding with the home video release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'', [[Warner Home Video]], now owning the rights to the film through their parent company [[Warner Bros.]], released a single-disc DVD featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\" cut of the film, with only some extra material being carried over from the former out-of-print Anchor Bay releases, a commentary by director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Bosco, and the theatrical trailer. This Warner Bros. release includes an edited version of the audio commentary from the Anchor Bay release. All comments about Anchor Bay are edited out.\n\nIt was reissued on 17 July 2018, under the Warner Archive Collection label as a two\u2013disc set, with the International Cut on Blu-ray (in a new 1080p HD remaster), and the \"Director's Cut\" on DVD, mastered in SD as the only surviving element of the longer version is from the same StudioCanal print used for the previous Anchor Bay release. The commentary from the 2000 video release, \"The Making of Supergirl\" Featurette, and a theatrical trailer were carried over to WAC's latest issue.\n\n===Deleted material===\n[[File:SuperGirlAltCostume.jpg|thumb|right|[[Prototype]] costume based on the actual 1984 comic book costume at the time, used only for camera test shoots and lighting|alt=Prototype costume]]\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nMaterial that was cut for the 105-minute version of the film included the Argo City opening, which was originally longer.\n\nAnother cut scene from the US release is known as the \"flying ballet\", though included in the International Cut. As Supergirl arrives on Earth, she is surprised to find herself capable of almost anything, especially flying. She can use her super-strength to crack rocks into dust, and use her heat-ray vision to help flowers grow.\n\nScenes concerning Selena, Bianca, and Nigel were also trimmed. In the U.S. version, Selena's introduction was merely a few lines long when the Omegahedron lands on Earth, and Selena takes it for use of its magic. The full introduction establishes Selena as an impatient [[Witchcraft|witch]], who is sick of her mentor and lover, Nigel, who is himself, a [[warlock]]. Later scenes not seen before the 2000 DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment, include Selena using the Omegahedron for the first time, and realizing that she has no control of herself when under its influence, namely the \"Roast Chicken\" sequence. Selena later throws a party for all her followers, and deleted material shows Nigel insulting Selena after being dismissed. Nigel then gets friendly with another party member, on whom Selena pulls a vicious magical prank.\n\nOther scenes involve Linda Lee making a temporary home in the city of Midvale, Illinois, and an extended version of the tractor sequence in which the possessed machine runs amok on the Midvale streets and kills a civilian. This alleged death scene does not appear in either the International or the 2000 Director's Cut. Another cut scene shows Supergirl unable to find the Omegahedron because Selena keeps it in a [[lead]] box, demonstrating that Supergirl's limitations are similar to those of her cousin. The [[Phantom Zone]] scenes are also longer.\n\nThe 2006 DVD release and current Blu-Ray reissue by [[Warner Home Video]], whose parent company, Warner Bros., is the current rights holder to the Superman movies, contains the International Edition, also called the \"European Theatrical Edition\". The latter release also features the aforementioned \"director's cut\".\n\nMuch of the deleted material appeared in DC Comics's [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book adaptation of the film, primarily the scenes that fleshed out Selena's character.\n\n====Broadcast television version====\nThe American theatrical cut for ''Supergirl'' ran at 105 minutes. ''Supergirl'' originally ran at 124 minutes in its European version. When it aired on network television in 1987, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] added numerous scenes from the International theatrical version as well as sequences not contained in any other edit. Shown in a two-hour slot, this 92-minute version was essentially a cut-down version of the \"Director's Cut\", otherwise resembling the U.S. edit, with \"offensive\" dialogue dubbed over for TV. This same 92-minute version was also seen in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] on most stations (as well as [[superstation]]s such as [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[WGN-TV|WGN]]) by [[Viacom (1971\u20132005)|Viacom]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.supermancinema.co.uk/superman_cinema/faq.htm | title = Superman CINEMA > F.A.Q. | author = GandalfDC, Hiphats | publisher = Supermancinema | access-date = 21 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nSome broadcast television versions have a scene not seen in either [[laserdisc]] edition: After Selena's defeat, Nigel is standing on the street.
