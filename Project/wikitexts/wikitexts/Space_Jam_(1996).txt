Jordan Sr.|James]], about his dreams of playing in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. Twenty years later, following his father's death, Jordan announces his retirement from basketball and pursues a baseball career.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[outer space]], the [[amusement park]] Moron Mountain is in decline. Mr. Swackhammer, the park's proprietor, learns of the [[Looney Tunes]] from his minions, the Nerdlucks, and tasks them with abducting them to serve as attractions. Upon their arrival in the Looney Tunes' universe underground, the Nerdlucks hold them hostage before [[Bugs Bunny]] convinces them into allowing them to defend themselves. Noting the Nerdlucks' small stature, the Looney Tunes challenge them to a [[basketball]] game. After learning more of basketball, the Nerdlucks infiltrate various games, usurping the talents of [[Charles Barkley]], [[Shawn Bradley]], [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], and [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Nerdlucks use these talents to transform into gigantic, muscular creatures, whom [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]] refers to as Monstars. The Looney Tunes realize that they need professional help.\n\nThe Looney Tunes abduct Jordan into their universe as he golfs with [[Bill Murray]], [[Larry Bird]], and Jordan's [[Personal assistant|PA]], Stan Podolak. Bugs explains their situation to Jordan, who is initially reluctant to help. However, Jordan agrees after a confrontation with the Monstars, and forms the Tune Squad with the Looney Tunes; they are joined by [[Lola Bunny]], with whom Bugs is enamored. Initially unprepared, Jordan sends Bugs and [[Daffy Duck]] back to his house to obtain his basketball gear. Jordan's children aid them and agree to keep the game a secret, while Stan, who is searching for Jordan, notices Bugs and Daffy, follows them into their world, and joins the team. Meanwhile, the incapacity of the five NBA players results in national panic that culminates in the [[List of NBA seasons|season]]'s suspension. The players try to restore their skills through various methods, with no success.\n\nThe game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars commences, with Swackhammer arriving as a [[very important person|VIP]]. The Monstars dominate the first half, lowering the Tune Squad's morale. During halftime, Stan sneaks into the Monstars' locker room, learns how they obtained their talent, and informs the Tune Squad. Disguising a bottle of water as \"secret stuff,\" Bugs and Jordan motivate the Tune Squad, who improve in the second half using their cartoon physics. During a timeout, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer: if the Tune Squad wins, the Monstars must relinquish their stolen talent; if the Monstars win, Jordan will become a new Moron Mountain attraction. On Swackhammer's orders, the Monstars become increasingly violent, injuring most of the Tune Squad.\n\nWith ten seconds left in the game, the Tune Squad are down by one point and one player, with only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy still able to play. Murray unexpectedly arrives and joins the team. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray's assistance but is pulled back by the Monstars. On Bugs' advice, Jordan uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and achieve a [[slam dunk]], winning the match with a [[buzzer beater]]. After Swackhammer scolds the Monstars for their failure, Jordan helps them realize that they only served him because they were once smaller. They insert Swackhammer inside a missile that sends him to the [[Moon]]. After relinquishing their talent, the Nerdlucks join the Looney Tunes and return Jordan and Stan to Earth in their spaceship.\n\nJordan later returns the talent to the five players, whose remarks convince Jordan to return to the NBA.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action===\nSome of the film's live-action cast play fictional versions of themselves:<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news| first=Janet| last=Maslin| title=Icons Meet: Bugs, Daffy And Jordan| date=November 15, 1996| work=[[The New York Times]]| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/15/movies/icons-meet-bugs-daffy-and-jordan.html| access-date=September 12, 2010| archive-date=October 31, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031035842/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/15/movies/icons-meet-bugs-daffy-and-jordan.html| url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Jordan]] as himself\n** [[Brandon Hammond]] as Michael Jordan (10 years old)\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Stan Podolak, a publicist and assistant who aids Jordan\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Juanita Jordan, Jordan's wife\n* [[Bill Murray]] as himself; he dreams of joining the NBA and later briefly joins the Tune Squad\n* [[Larry Bird]] as himself\n* Manner Washington as [[Jeffrey Jordan]], Jordan's eldest son\n* Eric Gordon as [[Marcus Jordan]], Jordan's youngest son\n* Penny Bae Bridges as Jasmine Jordan, Jordan's daughter\n* [[Charles Barkley]] as himself\n* [[Shawn Bradley]] as himself\n* [[Patrick Ewing]] as himself\n* [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] as himself\n* [[Muggsy Bogues]] as himself\n* [[Thom Barry]] as [[James R.

this made the company prepared for ''Space Jam'', which consists of a bunch of moving camera shots with 3D backgrounds to be added.<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt2\"/> The CGI backgrounds moved around with the motion trackers via Cinesite's [[proprietary software]] Ball Buster, which identified the markers through algorithm.<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt2\"/> To avoid mistakes in the visuals as much as possible, Cinesite artists worked on the film by frame instead of viewing each shot as a whole; those, such as Jonathan Privett were dissatisfied with the method, primarily because it put them under much pressure: \"We much preferred the good old fashioned run-at-24-fps, just-as-the-viewer-sees-it approach.\"<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt2\"/>\n\n====Backgrounds====\nThe design of the stadium was heavily dictated by that of the film's many characters, and it was such a long process that it went through 94 revisions, explained Cinesite digital effects supervisor Carlos Arguello: \"Tasmanian Devil was brown so we couldn\u2019t have a wooden brown upper level, and there were so many colorful characters, and Michael Jordan and everybody had to look good in all the scenes.\"<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt3\"/>\n\nFor scenes that take place in the stadium, shortcuts were made. For [[crane shot]]s of the crowd of 15,000 people in the final basketball sequence, it was created with live-action extras, cloned animated crowd members, and a few computer-generated characters walking around the aisles in the stadium.<ref name = \"Lyonsp12\">{{cite magazine|last=Lyons|first=Mike|title=Space Jam: Special F/X |magazine=Cinefantastique|volume=28|number=6|date=December 1996|page=12}}</ref> When these shots involved camera movements, a few 2D extras were animated to reflect the angle of the camera, but much lighting was added to distract from the crowd, thus minimizing this work.<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt3\"/> The reflections of the floor on the gym were also \"fake[d]\" as [[ray tracing (graphics)|raytracing]] would've meant rendering it for four days per a few frames.<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt3\"/>\n\n====Characters====\nAbbate suggested the hurried workflow of the animators bled into the character animation, resulting in a quick-witted style the ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons are most known for.{{Sfn|Lyons|1996a|p=8}}\n\nAlthough the animators had to work with almost 100 characters, they were the most focused on Bugs and Daffy not only because they were principal characters, but also because they were the most recognizable Warner Bros. characters to general audiences.{{Sfn|Bittner|1996|p=55}} [[Digital sculpting|Sculpting]] was incorporated the most on Bugs and Lola, including in \"beauty shots\" or sequences where Bugs and Lola are together.<ref name = \"CartoonBrewpt3\"/> Perkins conceived the idea of the villains being secondary colors, as the main Looney Tunes were either primary colors, black, or brown.{{Sfn|Lyons|1996b|p=13}}\n\nThere was also a lot of experimentation with [[motion blur]] with the 2D characters, especially Tweety; as Simon Eves explained, \"The workflow was that an artist would track some specific points on the sequence of 2D character-on-black that came from the animation house, and I think it was able to take a basic roto shape as well, and then it would generate an interpolated motion vector field which could be applied as a variable directional blur.
