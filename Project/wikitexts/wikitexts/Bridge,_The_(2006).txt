The film shows a number of [[suicide]]s, and features interviews with family and friends of some of the identified people who had thrown themselves from the bridge that year and one person who had jumped previously and survived.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.flintoff.org/bridge-of-broken-dreams|title=Bridge of Broken Dreams|date=October 13, 2007|author=John-Paul Flintoff|website=flintoff.org}}</ref>\n\nThe film was inspired by a 2003 article titled \"Jumpers\", written by [[Tad Friend]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers|title=Jumpers|date=October 13, 2003|work=[[The New Yorker]]|author=Tad Friend|author-link=Tad Friend|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The film crew shot almost 10,000 hours of footage, recording 23 of the known 24 suicides off the bridge in 2004.<ref name=\"kottke\">{{cite web|url=http://kottke.org/06/05/controversy-over-the-bridge |title=Controversy over 'The Bridge'|author=Jason Kottke|website=kottke.org|date=May 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"abc\">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2592841&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |title=The Bridge of Death|work=[[ABC News]]|date=October 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge}}\nThe Golden Gate Bridge, which first opened in May 1937, was the most popular suicide site in the world during the documentary's filming, with approximately 1,200 deaths by 2003.<ref name=\"lethal\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lethal-Beauty-The-Allure-Beauty-and-an-easy-3302966.php |title=Lethal Beauty |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=Edward Guthmann |date=October 30, 2005 | accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref> Its death toll has since been surpassed only by the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] in China.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/a-voice-of-reason-on-yangtze-bridge|title=A voice of reason on Yangtze bridge|author=Paul Mooney|date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe four-second fall from the Golden Gate Bridge sends a person plunging {{convert|245|ft|m}} at {{convert|75|mph|km/h}} to hit the waters of the [[San Francisco Bay]] \"with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building.\" Jumping off the bridge holds a 98 percent fatality rate; some die instantly from internal injuries, while others drown or die of [[hypothermia]].<ref name=\"lethal\" />\n\nIn his article for ''The New Yorker'', Tad Friend wrote, \"Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before\", supported by survivor Ken Baldwin explaining, \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I'd thought was unfixable was totally fixable\u2014except for having just jumped.\"<ref name=\"jumpers\">{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers |title= Jumpers - The fatal grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge|author=Tad Friend|author-link=Tad Friend|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=October 13, 2003|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, the city's newspapers sparked \"countdowns\" as the death toll closed in on 500 recorded fatalities. Television crews covered the scene as bridge officials managed to stop 14 prospective jumpers, among them a man with a sign reading \"500\" pinned to his T-shirt. The media frenzy was even more intense in 1995 as the total drew close to 1,000. The body of the 1,000th victim, a 25-year-old who was seen jumping, remains unrecovered.<ref name=\"jumpers\" />\n\nSteel said he was shocked that, despite the Golden Gate Bridge's notoriety and history, nothing had been done to prevent people from attempting suicide there. \"Most bridges where, or high places, if it's high enough that it would be a fatal fall, have put up [[suicide barrier]]s precisely for this reason.\"<ref name=\"gma\">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1900628|title=Man Survives Suicide Jump From Golden Gate Bridge|work=[[Good Morning America]]|date=April 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Production and film==\nSteel steered clear of publicity about the project to avoid a situation where someone would \"get it into his or her head to go to the bridge and immortalize him or herself on film.\" The camera crew consisted of 10 to 12 people who filmed the bridge day and night in 2004, using telephoto and wide-angle cameras.<ref name=\"abc\" /><ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/id/12534606/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/golden-gate-suicides-film-opens-tribeca/#.VLFdEWTF9bs |title=Golden Gate suicides film opens at Tribeca |work=[[The Associated Press]]|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few months of filming, the crew captured only splashes in the water and only knew someone had jumped when the Coast Guard arrived. The first jumper caught with the telephoto lens was not behaving as filmmakers expected\u2014crying and weeping\u2014but, rather, was jogging, talking on his cellphone and laughing; he then suddenly put his things away and leaped to his death. During filming, on average, one person jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge every 15 days.<ref name=\"abc\" /><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[The Times]]|title=The bridge of suicide|author=Catherine Philip|date=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Morning Fog at GGB.JPG|thumb|\"The rail is so low, a 7 year old can climb over it\", director Eric Steel said.<ref name= \"IvwPt1\"/>]]\nThe film also shows many people being saved from jumping. In one case a woman traversed the upper railing to the lower railing only to be pulled by her collar back to safety by an unrelated photographer. Filmmakers tried in each case to intercede when they could, succeeding in preventing six jumps. The crew members were trained in suicide prevention prior to filming,<ref name=\"ap\" /> and had their phones programmed to call the bridge authority if they suspected someone was about to jump. \"All of us came to the same conclusion that we were human beings first and filmmakers second\", Steel said.<ref name=\"abc\" /> However, in most cases there was either no warning or no time to prevent the jump.<ref name= \"IvwPt1\">{{YouTube|ADxUFAD6eBU|The Bridge - Director Eric Steel interview pt 1}}</ref><ref name= \"IvwPt2\">{{YouTube|mwYKs6ssYQI|The Bridge - Director Eric Steel interview pt 2}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A19849251 The Bridge Interview (BBC)]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6365207.stm Director's year at suicide bridge (BBC)]</ref>\n\nThe documentary also features an interview with [[Kevin Hines]], who survived his suicide attempt at the bridge in 2000. As he fell toward the water, he decided that he wanted to live after all and positioned himself so he hit the water feet first. He suffered serious injuries to his spine, but his life was saved by a black seal swimming below him. He later attributed the seal's presence as a sign from God.<ref name=\"gma\" />\n\nSteel interviewed relatives and friends of the suicide victims, but did not inform them that he had footage of their loved ones' deaths. He claimed that, \"All the family members now, at this point, have seen the film, [and are] glad that they had participated in it.\"<ref name=\"abc\" /> He filmed 120 hours of interviews.<ref name= \"IvwPt1\"/><!-- His first name was not Eugene - see http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/gene_r_sprague_born_1969_10755875 --> Jumper Gene Sprague's life is shown throughout the film, ending with his jump into the water, shown as the last jump of the film from two opposite points. While the film crew was filming on May 11, 2004, Sprague appeared at the Golden Gate Bridge and walked back and forth over the bridge for 93 minutes. Eventually, he climbed the railing, sat for a few seconds, then stood with his back to the water and fell motionless into the water below.\nAccording to Steel, Sprague \"walked across the bridge from the south to the north side and then from north to south, which are typically tourists. I did not think he would jump, but it must have been something about him that caught my attention.\"<ref name= \"IvwPt1\"/><ref name= \"IvwPt2\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|''Why he chose the bridge? I don't know\u2026 Maybe he just wanted to fly one time.''|author=Caroline Pressley, Gene's friend}}\n\n==Controversy==\nThe documentary caused significant controversy when bridge officials charged Steel with misleading them about his intentions. In his permit application to the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], a government agency that does not have any jurisdiction over the bridge but that does manage nearby park areas, Steel wrote he intended \"to capture the powerful, spectacular intersection of monument and nature that takes place every day at the Golden Gate Bridge.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Film-captures-suicides-on-Golden-Gate-Bridge-3313450.php |title=Film captures suicides on Golden Gate Bridge |author1=Phillip Matier |author2=Andrew Ross |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=January 19, 2005}}</ref>\n\nSteel says he lied on his permit application because he believed he would be instantly rejected if the true scope of his project was known. He also wanted to keep the nature of the project secret in order to prevent anyone from jumping to have their deaths recorded in the documentary: \"To me, the worst-case scenario was if word got out that we were filming around the clock.\"<ref name=\"ap\" />\n\nCelia Kupersmith, CEO and general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District, said there was an increase in suicide attempts at the bridge when the documentary began appearing at film festivals and attracting publicity.<ref name=\"abc\" /> District spokeswoman Mary Currie called the film an \"invasion of privacy.\"<ref name=\"ap\" />\n\nKyle Gamboa, a high school student from [[Fair Oaks, California]], skipped school in September 2013 to jump off the bridge, yelling \"Yahoo!\" as he leaped to his death. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported he had watched the trailer for ''The Bridge'' repeatedly. His suicide note read, \"I'm happy.
