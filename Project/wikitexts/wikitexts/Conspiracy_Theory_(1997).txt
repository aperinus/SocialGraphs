The original screenplay by [[Brian Helgeland]] centers on an eccentric taxi driver ([[Mel Gibson]]) who believes many world events are triggered by [[conspiracy theory|government conspiracies]], and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] attorney ([[Julia Roberts]]) who becomes involved in his life. The film was a financial success,<ref name=\"mojo\" /> but critical reviews were mixed.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" />\n\n==Plot==\nConspiracy-theorist and New York City taxi driver Jerry Fletcher continually expounds his ideas to Alice Sutton, a lawyer at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. She humors him because he once saved her from a mugging, but is unaware he spies on her at her home. Her own work is to solve the mystery of her father's murder. Seeing suspicious activity everywhere, Jerry identifies some men as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] workers, follows them into a building, and is captured. The interrogator injects a wheelchair-bound Jerry with [[LSD]] and questions him using torture. Jerry experiences terrifying hallucinations and flashbacks, panics, and manages to escape by incapacitating the interrogator by biting his nose and kicking him.\n\nLater, after being captured again, Jerry is handcuffed to a hospital bed and forced into a drug-induced sleep. Alice visits, and Jerry persuades her to switch his chart with the criminal in the next bed or he will be dead by morning. When Alice returns the next day, the criminal is dead, allegedly from a heart attack. The CIA, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and other agencies are there, led by CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jonas, whose nose is bandaged. Meanwhile, Jerry fakes a heart attack and, with Alice's help, escapes again and later hides in Alice's car. While Alice and FBI Agent Lowry are examining Jerry's personal items, the CIA arrive and confiscate everything. She declines Lowry's offer to work with her, and later finds Jerry hiding in her car. They leave the hospital and, on the way to Jerry's apartment, Jerry explains someone is likely following her. On Jerry's instruction, Alice switches lanes and finds that that someone is Lowry, whom they manage to lose track of. They go inside Jerry's well secured apartment, where he tells her about the conspiracy newsletter he produces.\n\nJust when Alice has decided Jerry is crazy, a [[SWAT]] team breaks in. Jerry sets everything on fire and they leave through his elaborate secret trapdoor exit. In the room below, there is a large mural on the wall, which features both Alice on her horse and the triple [[smokestacks]] of the [[Ravenswood Generating Station]]. As Jerry's apartment is burning, Jerry and Alice escape, with Jerry disguised as a firefighter to avoid suspicion. The pair go to her apartment, where Jerry accidentally reveals he had been watching her. Upon hearing this, Alice kicks him out of her apartment. On the street below, Jerry confronts Lowry and his partner staking out her place, and he warns them at gunpoint not to hurt her. After being tracked to a bookstore, Jerry sees operatives rappelling down from black helicopters and hides in a theater, escaping by causing a panic by saying \"Bomb!\"\n\nAlice calls each person on Jerry's newsletter mailing list and finds that all have recently died, except one. Jerry uses a ruse to get her out of the office, and then immobilizes the operatives watching her. During their escape, he tells her that he fell in love with her [[Love at first sight|at first sight]], then flees on a subway train when she brushes off his feelings. She goes to see the last surviving person on the subscription list, and finds that it is Jonas. He tells her that Jerry was brainwashed using techniques developed by Dr. Jonas at [[Project MKUltra]] to become an assassin and was stolen by another party, which only Jerry can identify. He also claims that Jerry killed her father. She agrees to help find Jerry, who sends her a message to meet him. He ditches the agents following them with a pre-arranged car transfer, and he drives her to her father's private horse stables in Connecticut. Meanwhile, Alice secretly calls her office so that Jonas can track her phone. At the stables, Jerry remembers that he was sent to kill her father, but found that he could not and had become his friend instead. Jerry tells Alice that he had promised to watch over her before the judge was killed by another assassin. Jonas' men capture Jerry, kill her hierarchical superior and attempt to kill or capture her without success.\n\nHaving escaped, Alice brings Lowry to the offices where she met Jonas, which they find cleared out. She then forces him at gunpoint to admit that he is not from the FBI, but from a \"secret agency that watches the other agencies\". He says that they have been using the unwitting Jerry to uncover and stop Jonas. Alice goes to the site of the [[Ravenswood Generating Station]] smokestacks from Jerry's mural and sees a mental hospital next door. There she hears and talks to Jerry through a vent, and an attendant she had bribed shows her to an unused wing. She breaks in and finds Jerry. As Jonas catches them, Lowry arrives with his men and attacks Jonas' men. Jerry attempts to drown Jonas, but is shot by Jonas from underwater. Alice, who has regained consciousness after being knocked out, then shoots Jonas six times. After killing Jonas, Alice tells Jerry that she loves him before he is taken away in an ambulance. Some time later, a grieving Alice visits Jerry's grave and leaves a pin that he had given her. She returns to riding her horse that she had stopped riding after her father's murder. While watching Alice from a car with Lowry, Jerry keeps to his agreement to not contact her until all of Jonas' other subjects are caught. As they drive away singing \"[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]\", Alice finds the pin she had left at Jerry's \"grave\" attached to her saddle, and smiles as she continues riding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Jerry Fletcher\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Alice Sutton\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as Dr. Jonas\n* [[Cylk Cozart]] as Agent Lowry\n* [[Steve Kahan]] as Mr. Wilson\n* [[Terry Alexander (actor)|Terry Alexander]] as Flip\n* [[Pete Koch]] as Fire Captain\n* [[Dean Winters]] as Cleet\n* [[Alex McArthur]] as Cynic\n* [[Kenneth Tigar]] as Lawyer\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Surveillance Operator\n\n==Production==\nAll scenes filmed at the horse farm used Lionshare Farm in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Gibson, delivering one of the hearty, dynamic star turns that have made him the [[Peter Pan]] of the blockbuster set, makes Jerry much more boyishly likable than he deserves to be. The man who talks to himself and mails long, delusional screeds to strangers is not usually the dreamboat type ... After the story enjoys creating real intrigue  ... it becomes tied up in knots. As with too many high-concept escapades, ''Conspiracy Theory'' tacks on a final half-hour of hasty explanations and mock-sincere emotion.
