Jean is his sister, and they have a younger half-brother, Matthew. Danny is close to his daughter, Eliza, a freshman film student at [[Bard College|Bard]]. Eliza shows one of her sexually provocative films to the family, who try hard not to show their shock and instead compliment its energy and production value.\n\nSome of Harold's work has been selected as part of a faculty group show at Bard, but he refuses to be part of a group show. Danny and Harold attend the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] retrospective of a friend and contemporary of Harold's, the successful L.J. Shapiro. There neither father nor son feels comfortable; Harold feels the art world has forgotten him and chooses to literally run away down the street. Danny meets Shapiro's daughter, his childhood friend Loretta, but is forced to leave to chase after Harold.\n\nHarold's younger son Matthew, a successful financial advisor to rock stars on the west coast in Los Angeles, is in New York on business and meets Harold for lunch with an accountant friend. They try to convince Harold to sell his Manhattan home and its sculpture, as he can barely pay the townhouse's utilities. Harold tells them the decision to sell the house is a private family decision and stalks out. At a third restaurant he criticizes the prices, but orders lavishly once Matthew says he'll pay.\n\nDuring lunch at the restaurant, Harold feels offended by the arrogant manner of another patron, and gets Matthew to intervene in scene involving running, chasing and embarrassment. They bond slightly in self-righteous indignation. That evening they pay a visit to Matthew's mother, Harold's second wife Julia, who has since married a man named Cody, a wealthy philistine. She tells them she is sorry she was not a better mother to Harold's three children; her directness makes them very uncomfortable and they are anxious to leave. Matthew resents Harold for preferring a life of art over money. \"I beat you!\", he screams at his father's departing Volvo. But the audience is meant to understand that even Mathew's success is merely him repeating the pattern of attending to irresponsible, childish, selfish artsy types like his dad.\n\nHarold is diagnosed with a [[subdural hematoma|chronic subdural hematoma]]. He enters the hospital, where as the days pass his children learn to manage his care themselves, after first leaning on Harold's doctor and nurse to do it. Outside the hospital Jean tells her brothers the family friend who happens to be visiting Harold at the moment exposed himself and masturbated in front of her when she was a child. Matthew and Danny let her walk away from them, then attack the friend's car with mounting exhilaration.\n\nAt Bard to represent their father at the faculty group show, Matthew and Danny get into a fight, of sorts, on the quad; later, bloody and crying, each makes drug-addled remarks in Harold's place, mostly about themselves, and Matthew ends up breaking down emotionally during his speech. As Harold convalesces at Maureen's place in the country (the townhouse was sold, despite Matthew's change of heart), it dawns on Matthew and Harold that Harold's favorite sculpture \"Matthew\", a lifelong object of resentment for Danny and Jean, was likely based on his feelings for young Danny.\n\nDanny, who up to now has been solicitous toward his father, refuses to care for him while Maureen is away and accepts his brother's offer of a trip to California, but he forgives him for his past failures as a dad. On the way to the flight he meets Loretta, now single, and she suggests they go together to the screening of a film Eliza has made. In the basement of [[Whitney Museum of American Art|The Whitney]], Eliza uncovers her grandfather's sculpture, long believed to have been lost. The slow pullback of the final camera shot shows how the Whitney Museum warehouse is full of \"un-harolded\" works by obscure artists, and the audience is meant to understand this dynamic as similar to that of the Meyerowitz family.\n\n==  Cast  ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Danny Meyerowitz, Harold's son. Currently unemployed and separated from his wife but musically gifted.\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Matthew Meyerowitz, Danny's half-brother and Harold's son. A successful financier who lives across the country and is currently separated from his wife.\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Harold Meyerowitz, a moderately successful sculptor and retired college professor.

Harold's daughter. Works for Xerox. \n* [[Grace Van Patten]] as Eliza Meyerowitz, Danny's daughter.
