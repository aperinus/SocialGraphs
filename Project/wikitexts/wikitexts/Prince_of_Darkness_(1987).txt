The second installment in what Carpenter calls his \"Apocalypse Trilogy\"\u2014which began with ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and concludes with ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1994)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/2/3279482/the-classics-john-carpenter-apocalypse-trilogy|title=The Classics: John Carpenter's 'Apocalypse Trilogy'|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|date=2012-09-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\u2014the film follows a group of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] students in [[Los Angeles]] who are asked to assist a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] in investigating an ancient cylinder of liquid discovered in a [[monastery]], which they come to find is a sentient, liquid embodiment of [[Satan]].\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] invites [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physicist]] Professor Howard Birack and his students to join him in the basement of a [[Los Angeles]] [[monastery]] belonging to \"The Brotherhood of Sleep\", an old order who communicate through dreams. The priest requires their assistance in investigating a mysterious cylinder containing a swirling green liquid. Among the thirteen academics present are wise-cracking Walter Fong, demure Kelly, the highly-strung Susan Cabot, and lovers Brian Marsh and Catherine Danforth.\n\nThey decipher text found next to the cylinder which describes the liquid as the corporeal embodiment of [[Satan]]. The team also learns [[Jesus Christ]] was executed for [[heresy]] after trying to warn the people of Earth about the vessel in which Satan was trapped. The liquid is then discovered to be [[Sentience|sentient]]. The academics use a computer to analyze the books surrounding it, and find that they included [[differential equations]]. Over a period of two days, small jets of liquid escape from the cylinder. Members of the group exposed to the liquid become [[Spirit possession|possessed]] by the entity and attack the others. The first victim is Susan, who begins killing off the others one by one, after which they too become possessed. Anyone who attempts to flee the monastery is killed by the growing mass of enthralled [[Homelessness|homeless people]] who have surrounded the building.\n\nProfessor Birack and the priest theorize that Satan is actually the offspring of the \"Anti-God\", an even more powerful force of evil bound to the realm of [[anti-matter]]. The survivors find themselves sharing a recurring dream (a [[tachyon]] transmission sent as a warning from the future year \"one-nine-nine-nine\" also known as 1999) showing a shadowy figure emerging from the front of the church. The hazy transmission changes slightly with each occurrence of the dream, revealing progressively more detail. The narration of the transmission each time instructs the dreamer that they are witnessing an actual broadcast from the future.\n\nWalter, trapped in a closet, witnesses the possessed bringing the cylinder to a sleeping Kelly. It opens itself and the remaining liquid transfuses into Kelly\u2019s body, causing her to become the physical vessel of Satan: a gruesomely disfigured being, with powers of telekinesis and regeneration. Kelly attempts to summon the Anti-God through a dimensional portal using a mirror, but the mirror is too small and the effort fails.\n\nWhile the rest of the team is occupied fighting the possessed, Kelly finds a larger wall mirror and draws the Anti-God's hand through it. Catherine, the only one free to act, tackles Kelly, causing both of them to fall through the portal. The priest then shatters the mirror with an axe, trapping Kelly, the Anti-God, and Catherine in the other realm. Catherine is seen briefly on the other side of the mirror reaching out to the portal before it closes. Immediately, the possessed die, the street people wander away, and the survivors (Brian, Walter, Professor Birack, and the priest) are rescued.\n\nBrian has the recurring dream again, and now sees that Catherine (apparently possessed) is the figure emerging from the church. Brian awakens and finds Kelly, seemingly Satan's vessel, lying in bed with him. This is shown to be another dream, and he awakens screaming. Rising, he approaches his bedroom mirror, hand outstretched, the final scene going black just before he touches the mirror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Priest\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Professor Howard Birack\n* [[Jameson Parker]] as Brian Marsh\n* [[Lisa Blount]] as Catherine Danforth\n* [[Dennis Dun]] as Walter Fong\n* [[Susan Blanchard (actress)|Susan Blanchard]] as Kelly\n* Anne Howard as Susan Cabot \n* Ann Yen as Lisa\n* Ken Wright as Lomax\n* [[Dirk Blocker]] as Mullins\n* [[Jessie Lawrence Ferguson]] as Calder\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Dr. Leahy\n* Robert Grasmere as Frank Wyndham\n* [[Thom Bray]] as Etchinson\n* [[Alice Cooper]] as Street Schizo\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm critic [[John Kenneth Muir]] suggests that ''Prince of Darkness'' serves as a parable for the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]] that was at its peak during the time the film was made.{{sfn|Muir|2015|p=142}} Throughout the film, [[demonic possession]] is depicted as something that is transmitted like a [[communicable disease]], via fluid passed between people.{{sfn|Powell|2004|p=148}} Muir goes on to note a number of references to [[homosexuality]] in the film, namely regarding the character of Walter, who makes several statements implying that he is gay (although he briefly flirted with Lisa, one of the female characters).{{sfn|Muir|2015|p=142}} In particular, Muir notes a sequence in which Walter, attacked by a number of possessed women while trapped [[Coming out|inside a closet]], emerges and flees.{{sfn|Muir|2015|p=142}} In addition to this, Muir writes that the film \"pointedly asks some rather big questions about human nature, our existence, and the universe at large.\"{{sfn|Muir|2015|p=143}}\n\n==Production==\n''Prince of Darkness'' was shot in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 30 days. Carpenter became inspired while researching [[theoretical physics]] and [[atomic theory]]. He recalled, \"I thought it would be interesting to create some sort of ultimate evil and combine it with the notion of matter and anti-matter.\"<ref name=Boulenger-201/> This idea, which would eventually develop into the screenplay for ''Prince of Darkness'', was to be the first of a multi-picture deal with Alive Pictures, where Carpenter was allocated $3 million per picture and complete creative control.<ref name=Boulenger-201>Boulenger, pp. 201</ref>\n\nExecutive producer [[Shep Gordon]] was also manager to singer [[Alice Cooper]], and suggested Cooper record a song for the film. Carpenter also cast Cooper as one of the homeless zombies. Cooper allowed the \"impaling device\" from his stage show to be used in the film in the scene where Cooper's character kills Etchinson.<ref>Boulenger, pp. 204</ref> The song Cooper wrote for the film, also titled \"Prince of Darkness\", can be heard briefly in the same scene playing through Etchinson's headphones.\n\nCarpenter cast people that he had worked with previously, including Victor Wong, Dennis Dun and Donald Pleasence. It was Peter Jason's first film for Carpenter, and he would afterward become a Carpenter regular. The film was shot with [[wide-angle lens]]es, which combined with [[anamorphic format]] to create a lot of distortion.\n\nCarpenter wrote the screenplay but was credited as \"Martin Quatermass,\" which, along with the name of Professor Birack's institution (Kneale University), was an homage to [[United Kingdom|British]] film and television writer [[Nigel Kneale]] and his best-known character, [[Bernard Quatermass]]. The story features elements associated with Kneale, including a confrontation with ancient evil (''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' and ''[[Quatermass (TV serial)|The Quatermass Conclusion]]''), messages from the future (''[[The Road (1964 film)|The Road]]''), and the scientific investigation of the paranormal (''[[The Stone Tape]]''). Kneale was displeased with the homage, fearing that viewers might believe that he had something to do with the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\nThe poster for ''Prince of Darkness'' was created and designed by Henry Rosenthal, who worked for print production vendor [[Rod Dyer]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Murray| first=Andy | title=Into the Unknown: The Fantastic Life of Nigel Kneale |type=paperback|year=2006 | location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Headpress]] | isbn=1-900486-50-4 | pages=158}}</ref> According to Carpenter in the DVD audio commentary, the post-production was done at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]].\n\nIn an interview with Michael Doyle in the November 2012 issue of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'', John Carpenter revealed how he created the eerie dream sequences in ''Prince of Darkness'' that feature a shadowy figure emerging from a church doorway. Carpenter first shot the action of the figure (played by actor Jessie Ferguson) with a video camera and then \"re-photographed it on a television set\" in order to give the image a peculiar, dislocated feeling that also appeared as if it was being filmed live. Doyle also reminded Carpenter that the director himself provided the disembodied voice that narrates each dream.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Prince of Darkness (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Prince of Darkness'' holds an approval rating of 61%, based on 38 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10.
