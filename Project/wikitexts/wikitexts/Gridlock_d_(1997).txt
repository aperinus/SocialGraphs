It was the directorial debut of Curtis-Hall, who also has a small role in the film. The film's opening was relatively low, despite critical acclaim; its opening weekend netted only $2,678,372 and it finished with a little over $5.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gridlock'd|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gridlockd.htm|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film paid tribute to star [[Tupac Shakur]], who was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murdered]] four months prior to the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Detroit]], ''Gridlock'd'' centers around [[heroin]] [[Drug addiction|addicts]] Spoon ([[Tupac Shakur]]), Stretch ([[Tim Roth]]) and Cookie ([[Thandiwe Newton]]). They are in a band \u2013 in the [[spoken word]] genre \u2013 called [[Eight Mile Road]], with Cookie on vocals, Spoon on [[bass guitar]] (plus secondary vocals) and Stretch on [[piano]]. Spoon and Stretch decide to kick their habit after Cookie [[Drug overdose|overdoses]] on her first hit. Throughout a disastrous day, the two addicts dodge police and local criminals while struggling with an apathetic government [[bureaucracy]] that thwarts their entrance to a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation program]].\n\n==Background==\n{{blockquote|It's largely autobiographical, with a lot of it coming from the time when I was a teenager in [[Detroit]], playing guitar and singing in bands. Everybody was doing drugs. That was the way we thought we could play faster guitar, write better songs ... One day my best friend, the bassist, and I were sitting around and decided that maybe we could actually play better if we weren't stoned all the time.\n\nNext day, we went to try and get into rehab. We were doing a bit of everything and were both sixteen, living with our folks, so we couldn't give our address in case they got to know about what we were doing. So we ended up wandering around from place to place, no one giving us any help. I remembered that when it came to writing my first movie.|Vondie Curtis-Hall<ref name=\"select\">{{cite journal|first= Sam |last= Upton |title= Smack is a bit of a taboo subject over here|journal=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|date=July 1997|page=113}}</ref>}}\n\n==Production==\n{{blockquote|It wasn't that easy because it was about [[heroin|smack]], which is a bit of a taboo subject here. And people were expecting it to be a real depressing movie about a couple of dope fiends ... Then [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] had just put ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' out and were like, 'We can't do two movies about heroin.' I didn't know anything about ''Trainspotting''. It didn't mean shit to me ... It's like saying you can't do two romantic comedies. Then [[Interscope Records|Tupac's record company]] came up with the money and PolyGram turned around and said, 'Hey, we always liked this movie' (laughs).\n\nThat's the way it usually goes in Hollywood. Tim was doing ''[[Rob Roy (1995 film)|Rob Roy]]'' in Scotland when I sent him the script. He read it on the plane back and got on board straight away. It was either him or [[Gary Oldman]]. It took about another six months to get Tupac because he'd just got out of jail and nobody wanted to touch him.\n\nBut there was this one company that really wanted to do the film with Tupac and, once they okayed it, things got a little easier. But he wasn't the first choice ... [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]] wanted to do it, but we couldn't afford him. I can't see anybody else in the movie now apart from Tupac. He and Tim are so perfect together.|Vondie Curtis-Hall<ref name=\"select\"/>}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tupac Shakur]] as Ezekiel \"Spoon\" Whitmore\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Alexander \"Stretch\" Rawland\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as Cee Cee\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] as Barbara \"Cookie\" Cook (credited as Thandie Newton)\n* [[Charles Fleischer]] as Mr. Woodson\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Mud\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Blind Man\n* [[John Sayles]] as Cop\n* [[Tom Towles]] as D Reper's Henchman\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Koolaid\n* [[James Pickens Jr.]] as Supervisor \n* [[Debra Wilson]] as Medicaid Woman\n* [[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Medicaid Nurse\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Admissions Person\n* [[Kasi Lemmons]] as Madonna\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as D Reper\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{main|Gridlock'd (soundtrack)}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Album\n!colspan=\"1\"|Peak chart positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Certifications\n|-\n!width=40|<small>[[Billboard 200|U.S.]]</small>\n|-\n|1997\n|'''''[[Gridlock'd (soundtrack)|Gridlock'd]]''''' \n* Released: January 28, 1997\n* Label: [[Death Row Records]], [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|\n* [[Recording Industry Association of America|US]]: Gold\n|-\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical reception ===\n''[[The New York Times]]'' editor [[Janet Maslin]] praised Shakur's performance: \"He played this part with an appealing mix of presence, confidence and humor\".<ref name= \"maslin\">{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=And You Thought Recovery Was Serious Business|work=[[The New York Times]]| date = January 29, 1997| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/29/movies/and-you-thought-recovery-was-serious-business.html|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref> Desson Howe, for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', wrote, \"Shakur and Roth, who seem born for these roles, are allowed to take charge \u2013 and have fun doing it\".<ref name= \"howe\">{{cite news| last = Howe| first = Desson| title = 'Gridlock'd': Surprisingly Footloose|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 31, 1997|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/gridlockdhowe.htm|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars and felt that Hall had not \"latched onto a particularly original notion of city blight.
