While on a retreat on the island of St. Est\u00e8phe, he meets wealthy stranger Julian \"Jimmy\" Dell and attracts the interest of one of the company's new secretaries, Susan Ricci.\n\nJimmy wants to introduce Joe to his sister, an Olympic-class tennis player, in New York and asks him to deliver a package to her. Susan sits near Joe on the airplane back to New York, converses with him about how \"you never know who anybody is,\" and talks about unwitting [[drug mule]]s. Suddenly afraid the package might contain something illegal, he opens it on the plane, but finds only a 1939 edition of the book ''Budge on Tennis'', which he damages while opening. Once home, he buys an intact copy of the book, which he drops at Jimmy's sister\u2019s building, and keeps the original at his office.\n\nJimmy suggests that Joe's boss, Mr. Klein, might not give him fair compensation for his work. Jimmy invites Joe to dinner, and seemingly on a lark opens a [[Swiss bank account]] for him with the token balance of 15 [[Swiss franc]]s. Taking him to dinner at a club requiring membership, Jimmy has Joe sign a certificate to join. Over dinner, he advises Joe to consult legal counsel about his position in the company regarding the Process. He invites Joe to meet with his own lawyer, and tells him to bring along the only copy of the Process.\n\nWhen Joe learns that Jimmy's sister does not exist, he realizes Jimmy is a con artist attempting to steal the Process. Joe contacts Pat McCune, a woman he met on the island who Susan told him was an FBI agent, and whose business card Susan kept. McCune\u2019s FBI squad enlists him in a sting operation to catch Jimmy. While fitting Joe with a wire for his planned meeting with Jimmy, an FBI agent explains the [[Spanish Prisoner]] con, a version of which Jimmy has been running on Joe. When Jimmy never shows up for the meeting, Joe realizes McCune is actually part of Jimmy's con game, and that his Process has been stolen.\n\nJoe attempts to explain what happened to his employer and the police, but finds that Jimmy has made it appear that he has sold his Process to the Japanese. The Swiss bank account that Jimmy opened for him makes it look as though he is hiding assets, and the certificate he signed to join the club turns out to be a request for political asylum in Venezuela, which has no [[extradition treaty]] with the United States. The police show Joe that Jimmy's apartment is a fa\u00e7ade, and that the club's members-only room was a normal restaurant. Joe is also framed for the murder of the company lawyer, George Lang.\n\nOn the run, Joe reconnects with Susan, who says she believes his story. Joe remembers that the hotel on the island maintains video surveillance, which could prove that Jimmy was there. Susan takes him to the airport so he can fly back to the island. Seeing a police roadblock on the way to the airport, she convinces him to drive to Boston.\n\nAt the airport in Boston, Susan gives Joe a plane ticket, and a camera bag, which unbeknownst to him contains a gun. Before passing through security, he realizes that Jimmy left his fingerprints on the book Joe was to deliver. He leaves the airport with Susan, still not realizing she is working against him. They purchase ferry tickets to return home. While Susan leaves to call Klein to inform him about the book, Joe attempts to board the ferry with the plane ticket, only to realize the ticket is for Venezuela, and that he was being set up.\n\nOn the ferry, Jimmy suddenly appears and Susan turns on Joe; the final step of the con will be Joe's death, made to appear as a suicide. Jimmy reveals what he has done with the Process, and turns his gun on Joe, but is hit with a [[tranquilizer dart]] shot by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] pretending to be Japanese tourists. They reveal that they have been following Jimmy for months, and that Mr. Klein plotted the con to keep all the profits for himself. Susan asks Joe for mercy, but he nonchalantly tells her she must \"spend some time in [her] room\", meaning prison.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Joe Ross\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Jimmy Dell\n* [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] as Susan\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Mr. Klein\n* [[Ricky Jay]] as George Lang\n* [[Felicity Huffman]] as FBI Agent McCune\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as FBI Team Leader\n* Takeo Matsushita as United States Marshal\n* Keiko Seiko as United States Marshal\n* [[Jonathan Katz]] as Lawyer\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as FBI Sniper\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Dialogue ==\nDavid Mamet is famous for his dialogues, which are characterized by incomplete sentences, foul language, stutters, and interruptions; it is known as \"Mamet-speak\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Mark|last=Rubinstein|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-rubinstein/writertowriter-a-conversa_1_b_4267732.html |title= Writer-to-Writer: A Conversation With David Mamet |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|quote= Your dialogue has been called street-smart and edgy.

At first it might seem as if anyone could master Mamet speak just by spewing curse words, but Zachary Simonson, who plays Bobby, pointed out that the language in ''American Buffalo'' is actually very precise and measured. \"There's a term called 'profane poetry' which very well describes what's going on\", he said. He explained that many lines are written in iambic pentameter, the same verse meter that Shakespeare used.

By disdaining to look and sound like anything overly serious, Mr. Mamet's [[Harold Pinter|Pinteresque]] speech rhythms succeed as nothing since ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1984 on stage, 1992 on screen) in capturing something pervasively paranoid in contemporary life. ... To enjoy the twists and turns in Mr. Mamet's puzzle-like plot, one must remain detached from the nominal protagonist. This is accomplished by having the character share the faux-na\u00eff speech rhythms and materialistic values of his employers and his business associates. ...
