The story focuses on a group of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] attempting to survive after a training mission against warfare A.I. goes wrong.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a technologically advanced near future, Katherine Mills, a [[cyborg]] working for Harbinger Corporation, discovers a reprogramming anomaly regarding a warfare [[Artificial intelligence|A.I. system]] located at Harbinger I Training Facility, an undisclosed military training island. She meets with Captain Damien Bukes and his team consisting of Drifter, Robinson, Cutbill, Goodwin, Hackett, and Loftus \u2013 all of whom have been assigned to a two-day training mission at Harbinger I.\n\nUpon their arrival, the team notices global communications have been disabled, limiting them to local access only. They discover autonomously operating [[Surveillance aircraft|surveillance]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]] monitoring them. The team begins their mission of eliminating A.I. threats. The first encounter proves easy for the team as they eliminate A.I. drones from a vantage point. During the battle, Mills discovers an advanced S.A.R. (Study Analyze Reprogram) unit, S.A.R.-003, but is unable to access it.\n\nThat night, Drifter and Mills discuss their pasts and Bukes' disdain for her. Later that night, Loftus is killed by the S.A.R. unit. The next day, they discover Loftus's body at the location of the first encounter. The drones take the team's original vantage point and kill Hackett. They discover the A.I. is adapting and learning from them. Bukes flanks two drones, which immediately disperse. Later, the S.A.R. unit captures Cutbill and has him shot and killed by another drone. The drones attack the group again and Bukes and Mills are separated from Drifter, Robinson and Goodwin. That night, the S.A.R. unit discovers Bukes and an unconscious Mills; it \"connects\" with Mills and leaves.\n\nThe next day, the team attempts to exit the training area, but they are attacked by smoke and gunfire. Drifter is shot and pinned down by the S.A.R. unit. Bukes kills Drifter as a [[Coup de gr\u00e2ce|coup de grace]] before the S.A.R. unit is able to. The team escapes into the barrier complex and discovers that the A.I. has killed all of the employees. Mills activates another S.A.R. unit to learn that S.A.R-003 reprogrammed the A.I. to use lethal force to improve soldier motivation and has ordered the soldiers to Harbinger I on its own. S.A.R-003 and other units break through the barrier door as the remaining team escapes through the back. Mills discovers an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device which can be used to stop the original S.A.R. unit but could also kill her or wipe her mind clean.\n\nBukes, Mills, Robinson, and Goodwin place explosives to prepare for a siege. The following day, A.I. drones attack the facility. The team wipes out more than half of the drones, but Robinson is killed in the ensuing gunfight. As S.A.R-003 approaches the team, Mills detonates the EMP, incapacitating herself and the drone. The S.A.R. unit reawakens and attacks Bukes and Mills. Mills controls Robinson's sniper rifle gun in the building to destroy the S.A.R. unit; S.A.R. however uploads its program into Mills before it shuts down and Mills loses consciousness. Hours later, a [[tiltrotor]] arrives to rescue the survivors. As Bukes and Goodwin approach the aircraft, Mills reawakens with S.A.R-003's mission protocol.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Captain Damien Bukes\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]] as Katherine Mills\n* [[David Ajala]] as Drifter\n* Bentley Kalu as Sergeant Rory Robinson\n* Tom McKay as Corporal Robert Cutbill\n* Mike Noble as Lance Corporal Martin Goodwin\n* [[Kelly Gough]] as Corporal Daniella Hackett\n* Osi Okerafor as Corporal Sam Loftus\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on 13 May 2016 in the United Kingdom and received a limited screening in the US on 25 November 2016.\n\n== Filming ==\nThe forest scenes were filmed near the village of [[Coldharbour, Surrey|Coldharbour]] in the [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills]], with several interior scenes shot on sets in buildings at Royal Albert Docks with the finale filmed at the EMI Old Vinyl Factory in [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]], [[Middlesex]].\n\n== Reception ==\nKill Command received generally positive reviews, with a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rating of 75%, based on twelve reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_command/ |title=''Kill Command'' |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]/[[Flixster]] |accessdate=11 August 2016}}</ref> Peter Bradshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the film as a \"superior sci fi action thriller\".<ref name=\"theg_Kill\">{{cite web| title = Kill Command review \u2013 superior sci-fi action thriller| last = Bradshaw | first = Peter| work = [[The Guardian]]| date = 12 May 2016| accessdate = 9 July 2016| url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/kill-command-review-superior-sci-fi-action-thriller}}</ref> Alex Billington of ''First Showing'' called the film \"impressive\".<ref name=\"firs_Firs\">{{cite web| title = First Trailer for UK Sci-Fi Action Man vs Machine 'Kill Command' Movie| author = Alex Billington| publisher = FirstShowing.net| date = 25 February 2016| accessdate = 9 July 2016| url = http://www.firstshowing.net/2016/first-trailer-for-uk-sci-fi-action-man-vs-machine-kill-command-movie/}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of films featuring drones]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|2667380}}\n\n[[Category:2016 horror films]]\n[[Category:2010s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:2016 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:2016 independent films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:Cyborg films]]\n[[Category:Drone films]]\n[[Category:Dystopian films]]\n[[Category:British action horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about artificial intelligence]]\n[[Category:Films set on fictional islands]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Essex]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Suffolk]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Surrey]]\n[[Category:British robot films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:2016 horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
