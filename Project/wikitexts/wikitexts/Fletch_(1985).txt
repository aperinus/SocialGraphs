Retrieved April 4, 2013.</ref>\n| gross          = $59 million\n}}\n\n'''''Fletch''''' is a 1985 American [[neo-noir]] [[comedy thriller]] film directed by [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] and written by [[Andrew Bergman]]. Based on [[Gregory Mcdonald]]'s popular ''[[Fletch (novel)|Fletch]]'' novels, the film stars [[Chevy Chase]] as the eponymous character. It co-stars [[Tim Matheson]], [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]], [[Geena Davis]] and [[Joe Don Baker]].\n\nThe film revolves around ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter Irwin M. \"Fletch\" Fletcher, who is offered a large sum of money to kill a millionaire (by the millionaire himself) who supposedly has a terminal cancer prognosis. Fletch becomes suspicious when he discovers the man is not ill; when he continues to investigate, his life is threatened.\n\n''Fletch'' did well with critics and at the box office \u2013 it was among the top 50 grossing domestic films in its first year of release. It has since developed a [[cult following]] and was followed by a 1989 sequel, ''[[Fletch Lives]]''. Subsequent decades saw many unsuccessful attempts to restart or reboot the series; another ''Fletch'' film, ''[[Confess, Fletch]]'' starring [[Jon Hamm]], was finally produced in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' undercover reporter Irwin M. \"Fletch\" Fletcher (who writes as \"Jane Doe\") is writing an article exposing drug trafficking on the beaches of Los Angeles. While posing as an addict, he is approached by Boyd Aviation executive vice president Alan Stanwyk, who assumes Fletch is a real junkie. Stanwyk claims to have bone cancer with only months left to live, and wishes to avoid the suffering. Stanwyk offers $50,000 for Fletch to kill him at his mansion in a few days' time, stage the scene as a burglary, then flee to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nFletch, not completely convinced on the truth of Stanwyk's story, agrees to the plan. Along with his colleague Larry, he begins investigating Stanwyk instead of completing his drug expos\u00e9, much to the chagrin of his authoritarian editor Frank Walker. Disguised as a doctor, Fletch accesses Stanwyk's file at the hospital and learns he does not have cancer.\n\nFletch visits Stanwyk's wife Gail at her tennis club. Pretending to be a tennis instructor and Alan's friend, he flirts with her during a tennis lesson. Looking into Stanwyk's finances, Fletch finds that Gail recently converted $3 million of her personal stock in Boyd Aviation into cash for her husband, to buy a ranch in [[Provo, Utah]]. Fletch travels to Provo and breaks into the realtor's office and discovers the sale price was only $3,000.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Chief Jerry Karlin learns of Fletch's drug report. He warns Fletch that the article will jeopardize his undercover operation on the beach. Karlin threatens to kill Fletch unless he agrees to drop the investigation.\n\nAt the tennis club, Fletch witnesses arrogant club member Mr. Underhill shouting at a waiter, and decides as revenge to use Underhill's tab to treat Gail to an expensive lunch in her private cabana. Fletch reveals Alan's murder scheme to her and tells her the true price of the ranch.\n\nFletch watches Stanwyk making a suspicious briefcase exchange with Chief Karlin, but is unable to deduce the nature of their meeting. When he is chased by LAPD officers lying in wait at his apartment, Fletch goes into hiding, returning to Provo. Posing as an insurance investigator, he interviews Stanwyk's parents, learning that Stanwyk has been married to another woman for eight years; his bigamous marriage to Gail allowed him access to her vast wealth.\n\nFletch arrives at Stanwyk's mansion on the night of the planned murder, but finds Stanwyk waiting to kill him instead. Fletch reveals his discovery of Stanwyk's real plan to fake his own death by killing Fletch (whose skeletal build is similar to Stanwyk's) and burning his body beyond recognition, then escape to Brazil with his first wife and Gail's $3 million. Stanwyk was also using his private jet to smuggle drugs from South America to supply Chief Karlin, who blackmailed ex-convicts Fat Sam and Gummy to distribute it on the beaches. Karlin arrives unexpectedly; learning of Stanwyk's intention to flee with nearly $1 million of the Chief's drug money, he kills Stanwyk. Karlin and Fletch fight over the gun until Gail strikes Karlin from behind, rendering him unconscious.\n\nKarlin is indicted after Fletch's article, with testimony from Fat Sam and Gummy. Fletch begins dating Gail, taking her to Rio on Stanwyk's tickets and using Underhill's American Express Card.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast per closing credits order and roles -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Chief Jerry Karlin\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as Gail Stanwyk\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Frank Walker\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Alan Stanwyk\n* [[Beau Starr]] as Willy\n* [[M.

After multiple attempts to get cameras rolling at [[Columbia Pictures]], production on the film stalled and the rights were eventually acquired by producer [[Jonathan Burrows (producer)|Jonathan Burrows]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI Catalog - Fletch |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/57687 |website=afi.com |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=July 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter Columbia Pictures passed on the film, Burrows shopped the film around at every studio in Hollywood. Trying a new tactic, Burrows submitted the script with a different title and put it in a different colored binder. Despite these efforts, there were still no takers \u2013 even Universal Studios, the company who would eventually go on to produce and distribute it. Among the studios that rejected it between 1975 and 1981 were: [[New Line Cinema]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[United Artists]], [[Warner Bros]], [[American International Pictures|AIP]], [[General Cinema]], [[CBS]], [[EMI]], Allied artists, [[NBC]], Zanuck/Brown, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]], [[First Artists]], [[MGM]], [[Path\u00e9|Pathe]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Time Life Films]].  Burrows credits [[Michael Douglas]] (who much earlier was considered for the lead) for having the foresight and wherewithal to get the film made; his half-brother [[Peter Douglas]] ultimately co-produced the film through his film production company [[Vincent Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web|work=Los Angeles Times |title=Douglas at 67: Intense|date= August 2, 1984 |url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/404167463/|access-date=2021-06-23|via=Newspapers.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen Mcdonald's ''Fletch'' books were optioned, the author retained the right to veto casting choices. He rejected both [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Mick Jagger]] as Fletch.

[[George Segal]] was at one point considered  but turned it down. Burrows also wanted [[Richard Dreyfuss]], after Chase initially rejected the part. Years later, Chase told Burrows that he never knew about the original offer and that it was his then manager who rejected it. In a 2004 interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Chase confirmed this was his favorite and most successful part.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fierman|first=Daniel|title=Chase on Chase|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,677277,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=December 22, 2012|date=August 13, 2004}}</ref>\n\nChase did not officially agree to take the role until after producer Alan Greisman and screenwriter [[Andrew Bergman]] got involved.<ref name=\"Bygrave\">{{cite news | last=Bygrave | first=Mike | title=Chevy Chase | work=Movie Magazine | page=7 | date=Summer 1985}}</ref> Mcdonald sent Chase a telegram saying, \"I am delighted to abdicate the role of Fletch to you.\"<ref name=\"Collis\">{{cite news | last=Collis | first=Clark | title=The Curse of 'Fletch' | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=February 5, 2010 | url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20342679,00.html | access-date=2010-03-26}}</ref> Bergman remembers that he wrote the screenplay very fast. \"I did the first draft in four weeks&nbsp;...

Around this time, Smith mentioned [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] and [[Ben Affleck]] as possible choices to play Fletch.<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,475789,00.html\n| date = 2003-08-13\n| title = 'Fletch' Lives\n| author = Liane Bonin\n| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]\n| access-date = 2007-02-17\n| archive-date = 2008-01-10\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110044326/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,475789,00.html\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2003, it was reported that the film was set to start shooting in January, with Smith still at the helm. Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused to take a chance on Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30&nbsp;million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]].<ref name=\"ew\" /> Though Smith considered compromising and casting [[Zach Braff]] in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSmith was replaced as writer/director by ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], in what would have been his directorial debut.
