The film stars [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Ed O'Neill]] as Danny and Kevin O'Shea, two brothers living in a small [[Ohio]] town who coach rival [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pee-Wee Football]] teams.<ref>{{cite news|author=Judy Brennan |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-21-ca-29582-story.html|title=PEEWEES' PLAYHOUSE : New Quarterback Takes 'Little Giants' Toward Goal|work= Los Angeles Times|date=August 21, 1994 |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> The film was produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] under the [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label.\n\n==Plot==\nDanny O'Shea has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, Kevin, a [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and local football hero. They live in their hometown of [[Urbana, Ohio]]. Kevin coaches the local \"Pee-Wee Cowboys\" football team.  Despite being the best player, Danny's tomboy daughter, Becky, nicknamed Icebox, is cut during try outs solely because she is a girl. Also cut are her less-talented friends, Rashid Hanon (who can't catch anything), Tad Simpson (who is a poor runner), and Rudy Zolteck (who's overweight and quite [[flatulence|flatulent]]). After being ridiculed by the players who made the team, she convinces her dad to coach a new pee-wee team of their own.\n\nAt first, Danny is reluctant to do so, but later accepts in an attempt to show Urbana that Kevin is not invincible, and that there is another O'Shea in town capable of winning. Kevin mockingly reminds him of the \"one town, one team\" rule enforced by the pee-wee football League, and with the support of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbana. Alongside Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (an intelligent boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny also gathers other children that have never been given a chance and dubs the team the \"Little Giants.\" One such player is Junior Floyd, a strong-armed quarterback who turns out to be the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd. Becky slowly develops a crush on him and struggles with her newfound feelings as a young woman.\n\nTwo local old-timers, Orville and Wilbur, encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin, reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith, has just moved to Urbana. Danny succeeds at recruiting him by tricking his overzealous father, Mike, into believing he is the famous \"Coach O'Shea\", but Spike proves to be rude and arrogant, and he refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's more well-structured team. Kevin also encourages his daughter, Debbie, to become a cheerleader and later tells Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. Believing it is her best chance to win over Junior and feeling exploited as her father's best player, she decides to quit the Giants and pursue cheerleading.\n\nJust as Danny's team start to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]], [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]], and [[Steve Emtman]]. They teach the kids about football and inspire them to believe they can win.\n\nOn the day of the game, Kevin goads Danny into making an impulsive bet: If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants' spirits are lifted when Danny gives them a speech, inspiring them to each remember a time when they had a unique accomplishment. He reassures them that they only need to beat the Cowboys one time to prove themselves. With this, they begin to make a big comeback with a series of outstanding and unexpected plays. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to the Cowboys, Mike Hammersmith orders Spike to take Junior out of the game; Spike injures Junior by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle, an act which angers even Kevin who considers it a dirty and disgusting play, and tells Hammersmith that he will not tolerate such disgraceful conduct from his players.\n\nWitnessing the attack on Junior from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a jarring hit on Spike. Other Giants make touchdowns while overcoming personal demons, such as Hanon's fear of dropping passes and making a reception, or Johnny running towards the end zone in excitement when he sees his little-seen father has rushed back from a business trip to watch him play. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21, the Giants make a goal line stand when Becky stops Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a trick play Nubie calls \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico,\" inspired by [[Tom Osborne]]'s famous \u201c[[fumblerooski]]\u201d. Kevin shouts out its actual name as it occurs, shouting \"Fumblerooski, Fumblerooski!\" The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the [[hook and lateral]] from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.\n\nAfterwards, Danny suggests that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbana, they should merge with the Cowboys, so that both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the stipulation that the town water tower be changed from \"Home of Kevin O'Shea\" to \"Home of The O'Shea Brothers,\" reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Rick Moranis]] - Danny O'Shea\n** Justin Jon Ross as Young Danny \n*[[Ed O'Neill]] - Kevin O'Shea\n**Travis Robertson as Young Kevin \n*[[Shawna Waldron]] - Becky \"Icebox\" O'Shea\n*[[Susanna Thompson]] - Patty Floyd\n** [[Janna Michaels]] as Young Patty \n*[[Devon Sawa]] - Junior Floyd\n*[[Brian Haley]] - Mike Hammersmith\n*Sam Horrigan - Spike Hammersmith \n*Joe Bays - Coach Harold Butz\n** Austin Kottke as Young Butz \n*Frank Carl Fisher Jr. - Billy Patterson\n*[[Mary Ellen Trainor]] - Karen O'Shea\n*[[Courtney Peldon]] - Debbie O'Shea\n*[[Alexa Vega]] - Priscilla O'Shea\n*Danny Pritchett - Tad Simpson\n*[[Todd Bosley]] - Jake Berman\n*[[Mark Holton]] - Mr. Zolteck\n*Mathew McCurley - Nubie\n*Joey Simmirin - Sean Murphy\n*[[Jon Paul Steuer]] - Johnny \"Viper\" Vennaro\n*Troy Simmons - Rashid \"Hot Hands\" Hanon\n*[[Marcus Toji]] - Marcus \"The Toe\"\n*[[Pat Crawford Brown]] - Louise\n*[[Harry Shearer]] - Announcer Cliff Parsons\t\n*Mike Zwiener - Rudy Zolteck\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was inspired by a 1992 [[McDonald's]] [[Super Bowl]] commercial<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dM3A8sJE5U|title=McDonald's Super Bowl XXVI ad Pee Wee Football|accessdate=February 15, 2022|via=YouTube}}</ref> developed by Jim Ferguson and Bob Shallcross.
