It stars [[William Holden]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Jonathan Scott-Taylor]], [[Robert Foxworth]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[Sylvia Sidney]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Ian Hendry]] and [[Leo McKern]]. Set seven years after the first film, it follows a now-pubescent [[Damien Thorn]] (Scott-Taylor) as he begins to realize his destiny as the [[Antichrist]].\n\nFranchise producer [[Harvey Bernhard]] wrote the screen story, with a screenplay by [[Stanley Mann]] and [[Mike Hodges]]. Hodges was the original director, but was fired and replaced by Don Taylor early in production. Unlike the first film, which was shot in [[England]] and [[Italy]], filming of the sequel took place primarily in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; [[Wisconsin]], and [[Israel]].\n\nIt was released by [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] on June 9, 1978, and received mixed reviews from critics. A sequel, ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'', was released in 1981.\n\n== Plot ==\nA week after [[The Omen|the funeral of]] Robert and Katherine Thorn, archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen learns that their adopted son [[Damien Thorn|Damien]] is still alive. Confiding to his friend Michael Morgan that Damien is the [[Antichrist]], Bugenhagen wants him to give Damien's new guardian a box containing the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to a local ruin to see the mural of Yigael's Wall, which was said to have been drawn by a monk who saw the Devil and had visions of the Antichrist as he would appear from birth to adulthood. Though Morgan believes him upon seeing an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face, both he and Bugenhagen are trapped and buried alive as the tunnel collapses.\n\nSeven years later, the 12-year-old Damien is living in Chicago with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn and his wife, Ann. Damien gets along well with his cousin Mark, Richard's son from his first marriage, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, Damien is despised by Richard's aunt, Marion, who sees him as a bad influence on Mark and demands that they be separated. She dies of a [[heart attack]] after being visited by a raven in the dead of night.\n\nAt Thorn Industries, manager Paul Buher suggests expanding the company's operations into agriculture; however, the project is shelved by senior manager Bill Atherton, who calls Buher's intention of buying up land in the process unethical. At Mark's birthday party, Buher introduces himself to Damien, invites him to see the plant, and also speaks of his approaching initiation. Buher seemingly makes up with Atherton, who drowns after falling through the ice at a hockey game on a lake the following day.\n\nA photojournalist named Joan Hart, a friend of Thorn Museum curator Dr. Charles Warren, arrives in Chicago and attempts to interview Richard.  When she asks about his brother's involvement with Bugenhagen, Richard angrily ends the interview.  Having recently seen Yigael's Wall herself, Joan is horrified when she visits the academy and sees Damien in person. She drives away in a panic, but her car mysteriously [[Stall (engine)|stalls]]. The raven appears and attacks Joan by pecking out her eyes. She is killed by a [[semi-truck]] after wandering blindly into its path.\n\nMeanwhile, at the academy, Damien's new commander, Sergeant Neff, is revealed to be a secret [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]]. Damien learns his true nature, and flees the Academy grounds. Later, Dr. David Pasarian is killed when he and his assistant suffocate from toxic fumes during an industrial accident. The incident injures Damien's class, who were visiting the plant at the time. When Damien alone is found to be unharmed by the fumes, a doctor suggests keeping him in the hospital as a precaution. The doctor discovers that Damien's marrow cells resemble those of a jackal; before he can investigate any further or report his findings, however, he is killed by a falling elevator cable.\n\nMeanwhile, Bugenhagen's box has been found during an excavation of the ruins and delivered to the Thorn Museum. Dr. Warren opens it and finds the Seven Daggers of Megiddo, the only weapons able to kill Damien, along with a letter by Bugenhagen explaining that Damien is the Antichrist. Warren rushes to inform Richard. Mark overhears their conversation and confronts Damien. Reluctantly, and then proudly, admitting to being the Devil's son, Damien pleads with Mark to join him on his rise to power, but Mark's steadfast refusal \"forces\" Damien to kill Mark by causing an [[aneurysm]] in his cousin's brain.\n\nShaken by his son's death, Richard goes to New York City to see a half-crazed Warren before being taken to the train station where Yigael's Wall is being stored in a cargo carrier. As he sees Damien's image, a switching locomotive impales Warren and crushes him against the carriage, destroying the wall and convincing Richard beyond doubt that Damien is the Antichrist. Upon his return, Richard has Damien picked up from his graduation at the academy while taking Ann to the museum. When they find the daggers in Warren's office in the Thorn Museum, Ann uses them to kill Richard, revealing herself to be a Satanist who \"[[Whore of Babylon|always belonged to him]]\". Having heard the altercation from an outside corridor, Damien wills a nearby boiler room to explode, setting fire to the building; Ann is consumed in the flames, as was her prophesied fate. Damien then leaves the burning museum and is picked up by the family driver, Murray, as the fire department arrives.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Holden]] as Richard Thorn\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Ann Thorn\n* [[Jonathan Scott-Taylor]] as [[Damien Thorn]]\n* [[Robert Foxworth]] as Paul Buher\n* [[Lew Ayres]] as Bill Atherton\n* [[Sylvia Sidney]] as Aunt Marion\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Dr. Charles Warren\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Sergeant Daniel Neff\n* [[Elizabeth Shepherd|Elizabeth Shephard]] as Joan Hart\n* [[Leo McKern]] (''uncredited'') as Carl Bugenhagen\n* [[Ian Hendry]] (''uncredited'') as Michael Morgan\n* [[Lucas Donat]] as Mark Thorn\n* [[Allan Arbus]] as David Pasarian\n* [[Meshach Taylor]] as Dr. J. Kayne\n* Fritz Ford as Murray\n* Owen Sullivan as Byron\n}}\n== Development and pre-production ==\n\n=== Writing ===\n[[David Seltzer]], who wrote the first film's screenplay, was asked by the producers to write the second. Seltzer refused, for he had no interest in writing sequels. Years later he commented that had he written the story for the second ''Omen'', he would have set it the day after the first movie, with Damien a child living in the [[White House]]. With Seltzer turning down ''Omen II'', producer [[Harvey Bernhard]] duly outlined the story himself, and [[Stanley Mann]] was hired to write the screenplay.\n\nThe earliest drafts presented Damien as a teenager and featured a female love interest. The love interest was deleted in the final film.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Academy Award]]-winning veteran actor William Holden was considered to star as Robert Thorn in the first ''Omen'', but turned it down as he did not want to star in a picture about the devil. [[Gregory Peck]] was selected as his replacement. ''The Omen'' went on to become a huge hit, and Holden made sure he did not turn down the part of protagonist Richard Thorn in the sequel.<ref>[https://www.amc.com/talk/2008/06/for-omen-2-will For Omen 2, William Holden Changed His Mind About Working With the Devil]</ref> Lee Grant, another [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner, was a fan of the first ''Omen'', and accepted enthusiastically the role of Ann Thorn.\n\nRay Berwick (1914\u20131990) trained and handled the crows used for several scenes in the film. Live birds and a crow-puppet were used for the attack on photojournalist Joan Hart. Berwick also trained the avian actors in Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).\n\n[[Leo McKern]] reprises his role as Carl Bugenhagen from the original film. McKern is the only cast member of the series to appear as the same character in more than one installment, although actor Tommy Duggan appears in the first and third installments of the series as different characters.\n\n''Damien: Omen II'' was the film debut of [[Meshach Taylor]] (Dr. Kayne).\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Under Mike Hodges ===\n[[Richard Donner]], director of the first ''Omen'' movie, was not available to direct the second; he was busy working on ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. British director [[Mike Hodges]] was hired to helm the movie. Four weeks into principal photography, the producers fired Hodges, claiming his working methods were too slow and placing the film behind schedule. \n\nHarvey Bernhard cited a demonstrative instance where Hodges spent half a day's filming setting up a single shot of Damien arriving at the military academy in order to place a [[bonfire]] in the foreground. Hodges maintained a screenwriter's credit on the finished film.\n\nIn later interviews, Hodges commented sanguinely on his experiences working on ''Omen II''.\n\n=== Under Don Taylor ===\nBernhard replaced Hodges with [[Don Taylor (actor)|Don Taylor]], who had a reputation for finishing films on time and under budget. Taylor reshot several of Hodges scenes, though several of the earlier director's takes remain in the final film, including:\n\n* The entire opening sequence in Jerusalem.\n* Some of the footage at the factory and at the military academy.\n* The dinner where Aunt Marion shows her concern about Damien\n\n[[Lance Henriksen]] expressed frustration that Taylor cut most of his role and character development.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gambin |first=Lee |title=Lance Henriksen and Elizabeth Shepherd remember Damien: Omen 2 |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=9781370881420}}</ref> \n\nTaylor also added the twist ending of Ann Thorn being a secret disciple of Damien who kills Richard in the climax.\n\n=== Filming locations ===\nUnlike the first film, which was shot primarily in [[England]], ''Damien'' was filmed almost entirely in the United States.\n\nThe film was mainly set in Chicago and was largely filmed in that city's downtown. The Thorn Industries building was actually [[Chicago City Hall]]. Another scene took place at [[Graceland Cemetery]]. Scenes that were supposedly at a New York City railroad freight yard, with the [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT Tower]] and the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] clearly visible in the background, were actually filmed at the Rock Island Railroad's 12th Street intermodel yard in Chicago, IL.\n\nOther locations included [[Lake Forest Academy]]'s campus, which was used as the Thorn Mansion, the [[Northwestern Military and Naval Academy]]'s [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] campus, which was used for the military academy, with real Lake Geneva students portraying most of the academy cadets, and the Murphy Estate on Catfish Lake in [[Eagle River, Wisconsin]] for the skating scene, with local children playing the skaters. The [[Field Museum of Natural History]], depicting the Thorn Museum, was also used in several scenes throughout the film, including some of its final minutes.<ref>See motion picture credits from Twentieth-Century Fox.</ref>\n\nThe opening scenes were filmed in [[Acre, Israel]], as well as the ruins of the crusader city Akko.\n\nThe interiors were shot at [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] soundstages in Los Angeles.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews, but was deemed as a worthy sequel. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 46% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"''Damien'' dishes out ghoulish scares and a Biblical body count to generate some morbid fun, but this repetitious sequel lacks the sophistication of its predecessor.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/damien_omen_ii/ |title=Damien---Omen II (1978) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=December 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Perhaps my resistance has given out but ''Damien\u2014Omen II'', though it's as foolish as the first film, is rather more fun to watch and sometimes very stylish-looking.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |date=June 9, 1978 |title=Screen: Damien Back in 'Omen II' |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=C6}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Damien is obviously wearing out his welcome, but presold interest and a couple of gruesome, ghastly death scenes should shore up business for the summer.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |date=June 7, 1978 |title=Damien \u2014 Omen II |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=28}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' found it inferior to the original because \"there's nothing particularly surprising or horrifying about a teen-ager in league with the devil.

Bernhard also felt that Goldsmith's music for ''The Omen'' was the highest point of that movie, and that without Goldsmith's music, the [[sequel]] would not be successful. \n\nGoldsmith's ''Omen II'' score uses similar motifs to his original ''Omen'' score, but for the most part he avoided re-using the same musical cues. In fact, the first movie's famous \"Ave Satani\" theme is reprised only partially, just before the closing credits begin. Goldsmith composed a largely different main title theme for ''Omen II'', albeit one that utilises Latin phrases as \"Ave Satani\" had done. Goldsmith's ''Omen II'' score allows eerie choral effects and unusual electronic sound designs to take precedence over the piano and gothic chanting.\n\nUnlike ''[[The Omen]]'' (and ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict|The Final Conflict]]''), [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s score was recorded in the US, with the soundtrack album re-recorded in Britain for financial reasons. [[Lionel Newman]] conducted both the film and album versions; [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] later released an expanded CD including both, the liner notes of which explain the reasons behind the re-recording (a short-lived union rule meant that musicians had to be paid the full amount for the film and album use if the soundtrack was released on LP, doubling their fee. It was cheaper, therefore, to re-record in the UK than pay the orchestra double in the US). The liner notes also explain that some of the soundtrack's pieces have been re-written slightly or even merged for the album re-recording. The audio quality of these UK-recorded album tracks also sounds noticeably more dynamic. Some sections of the film's soundtrack \u2013 the tapes of which were thought lost for many years \u2013 were discovered to have warped in storage and have noticeable and uncorrectable flaws. (The film soundtrack is listed from track 11 onwards).\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film was released on [[videocassette]] during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, it was part of ''The Omen Quadrilogy'' DVD set released in the US and UK, and was not available separately until 2005. In 2006, to coincide with the DVD release of the remake of the original film, ''The Omen'' and its sequels were released individually and together in an ultimate Pentalogy boxset digitally remastered and with more bonus features. In 2008, it was released on [[Blu-ray]] with its predecessor and 1981 sequel, ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]''. It is the only film in its series not currently available for [[online]] [[downloading]], although [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had it on its 'Add to Watchlist' and is available through them for download as well as [[streaming video]] with a [[Cinemax]] subscription, alongside its predecessor, sequels and remake, all of which are downloadable through Amazon, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iTunes]] and [[Vudu]]. It is now available for download with its original predecessor and sequels in an Omen 4-pack \"bundle\" set through Apple's iTunes and [[Vudu]]. It is also available alongside ''The Final Conflict'' for streaming on [[Disney+]] via the international brand [[Star (Disney+)|Star]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0077394}}\n* {{tcmdb title|72114|Damien: Omen II}}\n* {{Amg movie|12008}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|damien_omen_ii}}\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/15/edinburghfilmfestival2003.edinburghfilmfestival interview with Mike Hodges]\n\n{{The Omen}}\n{{Don Taylor}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:The Omen (franchise)]]\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1978 horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s mystery films]]\n[[Category:1970s supernatural films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:British horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of the Antichrist]]\n[[Category:The Devil in film]]\n[[Category:Films about Satanism]]\n[[Category:Films about telekinesis]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Don Taylor]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Lake Forest Academy]]\n[[Category:Films set in Israel]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Israel]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Stanley Mann]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
