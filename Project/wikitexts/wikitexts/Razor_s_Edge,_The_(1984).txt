The film is an adaptation of [[W. Somerset Maugham|W. Somerset Maugham's]] 1944 novel ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''.\n\nThis marked Murray's first starring role in a dramatic film, though he did inject some of his dry wit into the script. The book's [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] is dramatized as advice from the [[Katha Upanishad]]: \"The path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as a razor's edge.\"\n\n==Plot==\nIn Illinois in 1917, just before the United States joins World War I, a fair has been planned to raise money to support Gray Maturin and Larry Darrell, who are joining the war in Europe as [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|ambulance drivers]]. Larry looks forward to returning home to marry his longtime sweetheart Isabel. Larry shares a final night with Isabel watching the fireworks along with Gray, their close friend Sophie, and her husband Bob.\n\nAt the front, commanding officer Piedmont schools his new men on the harsh reality of war. For example, he has both of them armed, because in spite of it being an ambulance unit and America's neutrality, the enemy can and will kill those helping the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]]. He also destroys the headlights and windows of a fellow ambulance truck because the lights will signal enemies to their unit. Larry adapts quickly, shooting the headlights and windows of his own truck.\n\nLarry witnesses the deaths of soldiers and fellow ambulance drivers, and is in constant danger. By the time America is deeply in the war, Larry's unit is down to a few men. During an unexpected encounter with German soldiers, Piedmont is fatally stabbed trying to block a German soldier from shooting a wounded Larry. The war ends not long after, and when  Gray and he return to America, Larry suffers survivor's guilt and realizes that his life has changed. His plans to join Gray in working for Gray's father as a stockbroker will not make him happy, so he puts off his engagement to Isabel and travels to Paris in an effort to find meaning in his life. Isabel's uncle, Elliott Templeton, assures her that some time in Paris will help clear Larry's mind and take away any jitters he has about marriage.\n\nInstead of following Elliott's suggestions of staying at first-class hotels and wining and dining with the aristocracy, Larry lives a simple life, reading philosophy books in a cheap hotel. He finds work, first as a fish packer, then as a coal miner. After saving the life of a coworker by pushing him out of the way of an out-of-control mine car, he has a conversation about books with the elder miner. The miner discusses a Russian magician's book, lends a copy of the [[Upanishads]], and suggests that Larry travel to India to gain a different perspective.\n\nIn India, Larry joins a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery. As an exercise, he hikes to the top of a snow-covered mountain and meditates alone. After running out of firewood, he starts to burn books that he brought along. He finds his sense of inner peace. A monk lets him know that his journey is not over, that \"the path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as a razor's edge.\"\n\nReturning to Paris, Larry first re-encounters Elliott, who lets him know that many things have changed, notably that Isabel has married Gray. (She had ended her relationship with Larry after a disastrous reunion in Paris not long after he first arrived.)  They have had two children. Gray and Isabel were forced to move to Elliot's house in Paris after the [[Great Depression]] bankrupted Gray's livelihood. His spirit was also shattered when his father committed suicide after the crash. Larry learns that, while he was gone, Sophie lost both Bob and her child in a car accident and turned to alcohol, opium, and prostitution.\n\nLarry immediately attempts to reform Sophie, and after a period of time, they become engaged. Isabel insists that she will buy Sophie a wedding dress as a gift. During their conversation, Isabel admits she still loves Larry and condemns Sophie, labeling her a burden on Larry. She is interrupted by a phone call and leaves Sophie alone with a bottle of liquor.\n\nLarry searches for Sophie and finds her at an opium den with her former pimp. After a confrontation, Larry is left bleeding in the street with a black eye, while Sophie stays in the establishment. The next morning, Larry is awakened by two men at the door and brought to the morgue to identify Sophie's body. Her throat had been slashed by a razor. Larry then goes to Elliott's house to try to figure out what went wrong the previous day. Elliott has had a stroke and has been given his last rites. Larry confronts Isabel about what happened and forces her to admit her role in driving Sophie back to the bottle. She tells Larry what she did is no different from Larry ruining their relationship by running off to find the meaning of his \"goddammed life\",  but she admits that she still loves him and did not want anyone (including Sophie) to hurt him the way she, Isabel, had been hurt when Larry left her for the war.\n\nBefore Larry can respond, they are interrupted by the final moments of Elliott's life. Larry does a good deed for Elliott by convincing him that the Parisian aristocrats have not forgotten about him. (He had been waiting for an invitation to a costume party thrown by a French princess.) After Elliott dies, Larry comforts the grief-stricken Isabel. He admits that his journey was about trying to lead a good life that would make him worthy of Piedmont's sacrifice. Isabel and he part on reasonable terms, and he says his goodbyes to her and to Gray. He states his intention to depart for home, which prompts the question \"Where is home?\" He replies, \"America\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bill Murray]] as Larry Darrell\n*[[Theresa Russell]] as Sophie MacDonald\n*[[Catherine Hicks]] as Isabel Bradley\n*[[Denholm Elliott]] as Elliott Templeton\n*[[James Keach]] as Gray Maturin\n*[[Peter Vaughan]] as Mackenzie\n*[[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Piedmont\n*[[Faith Brook]] as Louisa Bradley\n*[[Saeed Jaffrey]] as Raaz\n*[[Richard Oldfield]] as Doug Van Allen\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Maranne]] as Joseph, the Butler\n*[[Bruce Boa]] as Maturin\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to an interview with director John Byrum published on August 8, 2006 in the ''San Francisco Bay Guardian'', he had wanted to film an adaptation of Maugham's book in the early 1980s. The director brought a copy of the book to his friend Margaret \"Mickey\" Kelley, who was in the hospital after giving birth. Byrum remembers getting a call the next day at 4:00 am, \"and it was Mickey's husband, Bill [Murray]. He said, 'This is Larry, Larry Darrell.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbg.com/disambiguation/|title=San Francisco Bay Guardian - Looking for a Guardian article?|website=sfbg.com|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nByrum and Murray drove across America while writing the screenplay. What they had written did not resemble the previous film version. Murray included a farewell speech to his recently deceased friend [[John Belushi]] in the script; this appears as Larry Darrell's farewell speech to Piedmont, a fellow ambulance driver in World War I.\n\nWhile Murray was attached to the project, Byrum had trouble finding a studio to finance it. At one stage, 20th Century Fox planned to make it.<ref>PEOPLETALK/BY LIZ SMITH\nSmith, Liz. Philadelphia Inquirer 8 Apr 1983: C.2.</ref> Murray wanted to play the part because \"it was a different kind of character, calmer, more self-aware.\"<ref>GETTING US READY FOR 'GHOSTBUSTERS'\nLyman, Rick. Philadelphia Inquirer;8 June 1984: D.1.</ref>\n\n[[Dan Aykroyd]] suggested that Murray could appear in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' for [[Columbia Pictures]] in exchange for the studio's approving to make ''The Razor's Edge.'' Murray agreed and a deal was made with Columbia.\n\n===Filming===\nFor the next year and a half, cast and crew shot on location in France, Switzerland, and India with a $12 million budget. The Indian locations were primarily in the [[Indian Himalayas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087980/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=The Razor's Edge|date=19 October 1984|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2017|via=IMDb}}</ref> After the last day of principal photography, Murray left to make ''Ghostbusters.''\n\nExecutive Producer [[Rob Cohen]] said, \"It's a timeless story about someone looking for values in this world. It's about a transition. Well, who can make a more extreme transition, somebody like Bill Hurt, who looks pensive to begin with, and will wind up simply a little more spiritual than he was in the first place, or a Bill Murray, who can begin as the class clown, go to war, come back, and having had traumatic experiences, start to question?\"<ref>AT THE MOVIES: [REVIEW]\nChase, Chris.
