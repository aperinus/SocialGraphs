It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $60 million against a $40 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring news producer Becky Fuller ([[Rachel McAdams]]) has dreamed since childhood of working for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show, but her dedication to her career puts off potential suitors. Laid off from her job at ''Good Morning New Jersey'', her mother advises her to give up her dream before it becomes an embarrassment. Becky perseveres, and receives a call from IBS News, which is seeking a producer for its struggling national [[Breakfast television|morning show]], ''DayBreak''.\n\nAfter a discouraging job interview with executive Jerry Barnes ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), who dismisses both her and ''DayBreak'' as also-rans, Becky is brushed off in the elevator by one of her heroes, veteran television journalist Mike Pomeroy ([[Harrison Ford]]). Seemingly against his better judgement, Jerry hires Becky as ''DayBreak'''s executive producer, and she moves to [[New York City]].\n\nOn her first day, Becky realizes she has signed on to a show in turmoil, lacking in direction and money. After meeting acerbic, long-suffering co-host Colleen Peck ([[Diane Keaton]]), Becky fires the lecherous co-host Paul McVee ([[Ty Burrell]]), to her co-workers\u2019 delight. She chooses an unwilling Mike as Colleen's new co-host; under contract to IBS, he has escaped being utilized while still getting paid. Becky finds a clause in his contract requiring him to accept an official job offer or lose his salary, forcing him to comply.\n\nBecky meets Adam Bennett ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]), a fellow IBS producer who worked with the difficult Mike. They begin dating, and he is initially supportive of her dedication to her job. Contemptuous of morning television, Mike tries to sabotage his ''DayBreak'' debut by getting drunk. He refuses to banter, rejects segments he feels are beneath him, and antagonizes Colleen.\n\nJerry informs Becky that IBS wants to cancel ''DayBreak'', blaming her for the ratings\u2019 further slump. After a heated confrontation with Mike, Becky snaps and decides on a radical approach to save the show. Persuading Jerry to give her the show's remaining six weeks to vastly improve ratings, Becky sends Ernie ([[Matt Malloy]]), ''DayBreak'''s weatherman, on stunts such as riding roller coasters and skydiving. \n\nColleen joins Becky's campaign to rejuvenate the show, appearing in colorful segments that help the show's ratings, but Jerry remains unconvinced. Adam, not realizing what is on the line, teases Becky about how caught up she is in improving the ratings; seeing this as a criticism she has heard from other men, Becky walks out.\n\nWith the six-week deadline approaching, Mike shows interest in doing a story on a [[sauerkraut]] festival, surprising his colleagues. Becky accompanies him, but realizes he is going to the Governor's summer house instead, and informs him that the show will be cancelled. Undeterred, Mike confronts the Governor on charges of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], breaking the story of his arrest on live television. Mike tells Becky that he was similarly over-committed to his job, at the expense of his family and personal life.\n\nThe live arrest increases ''DayBreak''{{'s}} ratings enough to secure another year for the show, and Becky receives a job offer from the \u201c[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]\u201d show. She reconnects with Adam, and lashes out at Mike for his stubbornness. Becky accepts the job interview, with ''DayBreak'' on in the background. When Colleen tells Mike that his refusal to adapt has driven Becky away, he walks off air and storms the kitchen. Becky watches in shock as Mike presents a cooking segment, expertly showing viewers how to make a [[frittata]]. Becky runs back to the studio, deciding to remain at ''DayBreak''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Becky Fuller, the new [[executive producer]] of ''DayBreak'', the fourteenth in eleven years, challenged with improving the show's ratings.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Mike Pomeroy, a serious news journalist and anchor who has worked in television for over forty years. He is unhappy at having to co-host a show that does not deal with real news stories.\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Colleen Peck, the host of ''DayBreak'' for the past eleven years, in which time she has gone through several co-hosts and executive producers.\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Adam Bennett, another producer at IBS, who begins dating Becky.\n* [[John Pankow]] as Lenny Bergman, the long-term senior producer of the show.\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Jerry Barnes, a network executive, he tasks Becky with turning the show's ratings around.\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as Ernie Appleby, the ''DayBreak'' weatherperson.\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Paul McVee, the co-host of the show at the beginning of the film. Becky immediately fires him because of his negative effect on staff morale.\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Mrs. Fuller, Becky's mother.\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as IBS Lobby Guard\n* [[50 Cent|Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson]], [[Lloyd Banks]], and [[Tony Yayo]] as themselves.\n* [[Chris Matthews]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Bob Schieffer]], [[Jonathan Bennett (actor)|Jonathan Bennett]], and [[Elaine Kaufman]] make [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Writing|Development}}\nThe premise of the film was partially inspired by [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Sunshine Boys]]'', where Harrison Ford's role was akin to Clark while Diane Keaton's role was akin to Lewis and Rachel McAdams' role was akin to Clark's nephew Ben.
