His old friend, high school principal Cletus Summers, has hired him as the civics and history teacher and as head basketball coach.\n\nThe townspeople, passionate about basketball, are disappointed that Hickory's best player, Jimmy Chitwood, has left the team following the death of the previous coach, who had been a surrogate father to Jimmy. At a meet-and-greet, Dale tells the townspeople he used to coach college basketball. The next day, fellow teacher Myra Fleener warns Dale not to recruit Jimmy. She is encouraging Jimmy to focus solely on his studies so that he will have a future away from Hickory.\n\nThe small school has only seven players. At the first practice, Dale dismisses Buddy Walker for rudeness, causing another player, Whit Butcher, to walk out in protest. Dale begins drilling the others (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and equipment manager Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the Huskers' dismay. Whit later apologizes to Dale and rejoins the team.\n\nDale instructs the Huskers to pass four times before shooting. During the season opener, Rade disobeys and repeatedly makes baskets without passing first. Dale benches him for the rest of the game, even when Merle fouls out, leaving only four Huskers on the floor. In a subsequent game, when a rival player jabs Dale in the chest during an on-court argument, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player. During the altercation, Principal Summers, acting as assistant coach, suffers a mild heart attack. Dale further erodes community support by employing a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results. Dale also loses his temper on court and gets [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from two games.\n\nWith Summers laid up, Dale asks former Husker Wilbur \"Shooter\" Flatch, Everett's alcoholic father, to be his assistant coach, with the requirement that Shooter be sober during all games and practices. Shooter agrees, on the condition that Dale not get ejected from any more games. Dale's choice of Shooter confounds the town and embarrasses Everett.\n\nMid-season, disgruntled townspeople decide to vote on dismissing Dale. Before the meeting, Fleener, sensing something amiss regarding Dale's past, uncovers years-old information about his hitting a player and being banned from coaching. However, Fleener chooses not to reveal this fact to the townspeople, instead telling them at the meeting to give Dale another chance. Nevertheless, they vote to fire the coach. Then Jimmy Chitwood arrives and announces he will rejoin the team, but only if Dale remains as coach. A new vote is taken, and the residents overwhelmingly choose to keep Dale. \n\nAfter Jimmy's return, the reinvigorated Huskers rack up a series of wins. To prove to the townspeople (and to Shooter himself) Shooter's value to the team, Dale intentionally gets ejected from a game. This forces Shooter to devise a play that helps Hickory win on a last-second shot.\n\nDespite a setback when Shooter relapses, the team advances through the state tournament with Jimmy's strong performance. Unsung players, such as short Ollie and devoutly religious Strap, also contribute. Hickory reaches the championship game in [[Indianapolis]].\n\nAt [[Butler Fieldhouse]], and before the largest crowd they have ever seen, the Huskers face long odds to defeat the heavily favored [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] Central Bears, who have taller and more athletic players. After falling behind, Hickory fights their way back and ties the game with just a few seconds left. Dale calls his team's final timeout and sets up a play for Jimmy to put up the last shot. He scores as the game buzzer sounds, and Hickory wins the 1952 Indiana state championship. Sometime after the game, a large black-and-white photograph of Coach Dale and the team with their state championship trophy is seen hanging in the Hickory High School gymnasium, with a voiceover from Dale stating, \"I love you guys.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Norman Dale\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Myra Fleener\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Shooter Flatch\n* [[Sheb Wooley]] as Cletus Summers\n* [[Maris Valainis]] as Jimmy Chitwood\n* David Neidorf as Everett Flatch\n* [[Brad Long (actor)|Brad Long]] as Buddy Walker\n* [[Steve Hollar]] as Rade Butcher\n* Brad Boyle as Whit Butcher\n* Wade Schenck as Ollie McLellan\n* Kent Poole as Merle Webb\n* Scott Summers as Strap Purl\n* [[Fern Persons]] as Opal Fleener\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as George Walker\n* Michael Sassone as Preacher Purl\n* Gloria Dorson as Millie\n* [[Hilliard Gates]] as Radio Announcer\n* Michael O'Guinne as Rooster\n* Wil Dewitt as Reverend Doty\n* John Robert Thompson as Sheriff Finley\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Basis==\n[[File:Milan1954.jpg|thumb|right|[[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] Basketball Team, 1954.]] The film is inspired in part by the story of the [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|1954 Indiana state champions]], [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|a\u026a|l|\u0259n}} {{respell|MY|l\u0259n}}). The phrase \"inspired by a true story\" is more appropriate than \"based on a true story\" because the two teams have little in common.<ref name=reallife>{{cite web|title= 'Hoosiers' in reel life|url= http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020327.html|work= [[ESPN.com]]|access-date= June 11, 2010|first= Jeff|last= Merron|archive-date= April 2, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402205506/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020327.html|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. In 1954, Indiana conducted a single state basketball tournament for all its high schools. This practice continued until 1997.<ref name=reallife/>\n\nSome plot points are similar to Milan's real story. Like the film's fictional Hickory High School, Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by 2 points: Hickory won 42\u201340, and Milan won 32\u201330. The last seconds of the ''Hoosiers'' state final are fairly close to the details of Milan's 1954 final; the last basket in the film was made from virtually the same spot on the floor as [[Bobby Plump]]'s actual game-winner. The movie's final game was filmed in the same gymnasium that hosted the 1954 Indiana state championship game, [[Butler University]]'s [[Hinkle Fieldhouse]] (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in [[Indianapolis]].<ref name=reallife/>\n\nUnlike the film's plot, the 1954 Milan Indians came into the season as heavy favorites and finished the '53\u2013'54 regular season at 19\u20132. In addition, the 1952\u20131953 team went to the state semifinals, and they were considered a powerhouse going into the championship season despite the school's small enrollment.<ref name=reallife/>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Gymnasium in Knightstown.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hoosier Gym|Hickory's gymnasium]]]]\nDuring filming in the autumn of 1985, on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse, directors were unable to secure enough extras for shooting the final scenes even after casting calls through the Indianapolis media. To help fill the stands, they invited two local high schools to move a game to the Fieldhouse. [[Broad Ripple High School|Broad Ripple]] and [[Bishop Chatard High School|Chatard]], the alma mater of [[Maris Valainis]] who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe film's producers chose [[New Richmond, Indiana]] to serve as the fictional town of Hickory and recorded most of the film's location shots in and around the community. Signs on the roads into New Richmond still recall its role in the film. In addition, the old schoolhouse in [[Nineveh, Indiana|Nineveh]] was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hoosiersarchive.com/behind-the-scenes-2/filming-locations-and-schedule/sites/|title=Sites {{!}} The Hoosiers Archive|website=hoosiersarchive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-13|archive-date=September 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913092225/http://hoosiersarchive.com/behind-the-scenes-2/filming-locations-and-schedule/sites/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe home court of Hickory is located in [[Knightstown, Indiana|Knightstown]] and is now known as the \"[[Hoosier Gym]].\"\n\nPizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers approved a production budget of only $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the film would be a \"career killer.\" Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor [[Orion Pictures]], ''Hoosiers'' grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=5813889 |title=ESPN the Magazine Movie Spectacular - An oral history of \"Hoosiers,\" an iconic sports movie - ESPN<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=December 20, 2010 |archive-date=November 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125145147/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=5813889 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nShortly after the film's release, five of the actors who portrayed basketball players in the film were suspended by the [[NCAA]] from their real-life college basketball teams for three games.

Goldsmith used a hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements in juxtaposition to the 1950s setting to score the film.

He knows all about high school politics and how the school board and the parents' groups always think they know more about basketball than the coach does. He knows about gossip, scandal and vengeance. And he knows a lot about human nature. All of his knowledge, however, would be pointless without Hackman's great performance at the center of this movie. Hackman is gifted at combining likability with complexity \u2014 two qualities that usually don't go together in the movies. He projects all of the single-mindedness of any good coach, but then he contains other dimensions, and we learn about the scandal in his past that led him to this one-horse town.
