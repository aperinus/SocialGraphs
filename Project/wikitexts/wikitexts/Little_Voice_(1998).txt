She is known as LV (short for Little Voice) because of her soft, shy, and childlike speaking voice. She flees reality, hiding away in her bedroom, listening to records and impersonating the voices of American and British artists such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Gracie Fields]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Shirley Bassey]]; her love of songs is her only source of strength since her beloved father's death. Her mother, a [[promiscuous]] woman with countless affairs, dumps a man when her passion wanes.\n\nBilly, a telephone engineer who installs their new telephone, approaches LV on the pretense of giving her information pamphlets. Things improve when Mari is seeing Ray Say, who manages third-rate acts; he hears the girl sing, spots her gift, and vows to make her a star, while Mari, who dislikes singing, still doubts her. Ray arranges for LV to sing at a club owned by Mr. Boo. But her performance is a failure as she is overcome by stage fright and only sings a few lines. Ray sees that LV needs encouragement on stage and works with Mr. Boo to organize a big band, lights, and a new dress to give her confidence.\n\nRay gives her a pep talk, persuading her to perform by portraying her act as a tribute to her father. LV agrees to sing again, but only as a one-off.  LV envisions her father sitting in the club as she performs; she brings the house down and is a storming success. Ray thinks she is his ticket to the big time and arranges for a London agent to come and see LV perform the following night. As Ray, Mari and Mr. Boo toast their future success, LV murmurs that she agreed to sing only one time and slumps to the floor.\n\nThe following night LV passively remains in her bed while the selfish natures of Ray and Mari are very much revealed: Ray's futile attempts to goad LV are dashed, and Mari still scorns and prods her. At the cabaret club, the London agent finally loses patience after several third-rate acts fill the time in LV's absence and leave. Ray storms into the club and sings [[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|\"It's Over\"]] on stage, as his career, disappears before everyone's eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, the faulty wiring at LV's home finally starts a fire, trapping LV in her upper room where she is rescued by Billy. In a final showdown with her mother, after being wrongly accused by her mother of arson, LV responds by screaming in her mother's face. Blaming her for her father's death and blaming her own meek nature on Mari's domineering attitude, she walks away saying her name isn't Little Voice, it's Laura.\n\nMari is left by everyone, Ray is facing his debt collectors, and Laura is saved by her discovery of self-confidence.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Mari\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Ray Say\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Mr. Boo\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Billy\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as LV (Little Voice / Laura)\n* [[Annette Badland]] as Sadie\n* [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as George\n}}\n\nIn addition, Graham Turner portrays LV\u2019s father, in photos and in her imagination.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 79% rating based on 48 reviews with the consensus: \"''Little Voice'' brings its award-winning source material to the screen in style, elevated by a commanding lead performance from Jane Horrocks.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|little_voice|Little Voice}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2014-02-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] wrote in her ''[[New York Times]]'' review, \"Horrocks's phenomenal mimicry of musical grande dames from [[Marlene Dietrich]] to Marilyn Monroe, lavishing special loving care on Judy Garland, makes a splendid centerpiece for the otherwise more ordinary film built around it.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=December 4, 1998 |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |title='Little Voice': She's Wispy and Painfully Shy, but Onstage Her Mimicry Is Near Perfect |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/120498voice-film-review.html |website=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' felt the story was \"amusing but uneven\" and that the film \"seems to have all the pieces in place for another one of those whimsical, comic British slices of life. But the movie doesn't quite deliver the way we think it will. One problem is that the Michael Caine character, sympathetic and funny in the opening and middle scenes, turns mean at the end for no good reason. Another is that the romance, and a manufactured crisis, distract from the true climax of the movie. That would be Jane Horrocks' vocal performance ... she is amazing. Absolutely fabulous.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=December 4, 1998 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Little Voice |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/little-voice-1998 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }} {{Rating|3|4}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Derek Elley called the film \"a small picture with a big heart\", adding, \"The film has almost everything going for it, with the exceptions of a somewhat lopsided structure in which the climax comes two-thirds of the way through and a romantic subplot that plays like an afterthought. Nevertheless, smooth direction by Mark Herman and juicy performances by a host of Brit character actors ... ensure an entertaining ride ... Horrocks, whose combo of gamin physique and big vocal talent make the title role seem unthinkable for any other actress, is a revelation, handling moments of solo emotion and onstage strutting with equal, moving panache.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=6 October 1998 |last=Elley |first=Derek |title=Little Voice |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117477939 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!
