Rosenthal (director)|David M. Rosenthal]], produced by [[Tommy Oliver (producer)|Tommy Oliver]] and written by [[Alan B. McElroy]] and Tyger Williams and stars [[Sanaa Lathan]], [[Morris Chestnut]] and [[Michael Ealy]]. Ealy and Lathan also served as executive producers on the film.<ref>http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/entry/view/id/1002863 {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> The film centers on a single woman who falls in love with a man who harbors an obsession after she breaks up with him. ''The Perfect Guy'' was released in North America on September 11, 2015 and garnered negative reviews from critics, praising the filmmaking and performances but criticized the script for being underwritten and lacking in thriller moments. The film was a box-office success, grossing $60.3 million against its $12 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSuccessful lobbyist Leah Vaughn breaks up with her boyfriend, Dave King, because he refuses to commit to her wishes of starting a family. Two months later, she meets Carter Duncan, a charming man who works in IT for another company. They quickly grow close and he works his way into the hearts of her friends and family. On their way home from a trip to San Francisco to meet her parents, a stranger at a gas station asks Leah about Carter's Dodge Charger. Carter viciously attacks the man, and Carter and Leah drive off when the station's owner orders them to leave. Distraught over his actions, Leah decides to break up with him that night.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Carter stalks Leah at her job, and makes numerous phone calls, even after she changes her phone number. Unbeknownst to Leah, Carter also gets into her house with her spare key. He goes through her belongings, hacks into her computer, and abducts her cat. She finally decides to go to the police, meeting with Detective Hansen, who advises her to keep records of any further attempts Carter makes to contact her. Leah later finds a threatening note and a single red rose attached to her car and files a [[restraining order]] against Carter, causing him to lose his job.\n\nLater, Dave contacts Leah about rekindling their relationship and Leah eagerly agrees. One night, Leah and Dave find Carter watching them at a restaurant, and Dave grimly warns him to stay away. They notify the police and, after Hansen interrogates Carter over the violation, Carter feigns innocence, stating  he had no idea she was there and that Dave was aggressive towards him. Hansen lets him go.\n\nOne night, Leah's neighbor, Mrs. McCarthy, discovers Carter inside Leah's house, and he pushes her down the stairs, killing her.  Carter secretly videotapes Leah and Dave as they sleep and make love and uses Leah's work email account to send the video to her co-workers and her business's clients, causing her to be suspended from her job. Carter also sabotages Dave's car, causing it to crash, and suffocates the injured Dave.\n\nBoth Leah and Hansen are certain that Carter is involved in Dave's death, though they lack the evidence necessary to incriminate him. After investigating further, Hansen learns that Carter's real name is Robert Adams, and that he changed his identity after a similar series of harassment. With the situation escalating, a concerned Hansen relays a story to Leah of a friend of his that bought a 12-gauge Remington [[shotgun]] that he loaded with two [[bean bag round]]s and five live shells. Hansen explains that the bean bag rounds, if fired first as warning shots, would give justification in the event of an intruder and implies that Leah should take such action, leading to Leah buying a shotgun.\n\nLeah discovers Robert, with a new identity, with another woman. She frightens her off and files another restraining order against him in front of his new employers, once again getting him fired. She then manages to find his hideout,  where he monitors her, as well as finding her cat. She destroys his numerous computers and leaves, daring him to come after her again.\n\nThat night, Robert breaks into Leah's home, and, after luring him to an empty room, she aims her gun at him. After managing to knock the gun out of her hand, a struggle ensues. Leah manages to recover her shotgun and, per Hansen's story, shoots Robert twice with bean bag rounds as a warning to make killing him justified, while claiming that the bean bag rounds are all that she has in the shotgun. When Robert persists in attacking, believing that Leah cannot kill him, Leah shoots him with a live shell from the shotgun; a fatally wounded and stunned Robert only has enough time to hear Leah confess that she lied about having no live shells before dying. A now-relieved Leah reports Robert to Hansen as an intruder, and the police cart his corpse out of her house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Leah Vaughn\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as David \"Dave\" King\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Carter Duncan/Robert Adams\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Mrs. McCarthy\n* [[Charles S.
