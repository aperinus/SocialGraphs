The screenplay was written by Gillian Houghton, who was then head writer of the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', using the [[pen name]] Gabrielle Upton. This would be Upton's sole contribution to the Gidget canon. The story was based on Kohner's 1957 novel ''[[Gidget|Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas]]''.\n\nThe film, which received one award nomination, not only inspired various sequel films, a television series, and [[television film]]s, but is also considered the beginning of the entire \"[[beach party film]]\" genre. ''Gidget'' is credited by numerous sources (''Stoked! A History of Surf Culture'' by Drew Kampion; ''The Encyclopedia of Surfing'' by [[Matt Warshaw]]; and ''[[Riding Giants]]'' a documentary film by [[Stacy Peralta]]\u2014to name just three) as the single biggest factor in the mainstreaming of surfing culture in the United States.<ref>[http://jeffspurrier.com/Writings/gidget.pdf \"A Generation of Gidgets\"], by Jeff Spurrier, ''The Atlantic Monthly'', April 2002 Retrieved 4 August 2009.</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/17/entertainment/et-gidget17 \"Surfer Girl, Forever\"] by Hugo Martin, ''Los Angeles Times'', June 17, 2006.

She resists the pressure to go \"man-hunting\" with her girlfriends and laments the days when the girls had fun together without boys. Francine also rejects her parents wishing to fix her up on a date with the son of a friend of the family, Jeffrey Matthews ([[James Darren]]).\n\nOn a jaunt to the beach with her well developed girlfriends, flat-chested tomboy Francine meets surfer [[Moondoggie]]. She quickly becomes infatuated with him, but he shows no romantic interest; at any rate, Francine is more attracted to surfing than man-hunting.\n\nAt home, Francine importunes her parents for $25 for a used [[surfboard]]. Russ ([[Arthur O'Connell]]) and Dorothy Lawrence ([[Mary LaRoche]]) grant their daughter's request as an early birthday present and the excited youngster returns to the beach to surf. The gang dubs their female associate \"Gidget\", a [[portmanteau word|combination]] of \"girl\" and \"midget\".\n\nGidget associates with an all-male surfer gang led by the worldly [[Beachcombing|beach bum]], [[Kahoona|The Big Kahuna]] ([[Cliff Robertson]]). Kahuna is a [[Korean War]] Air Force veteran twice the age of Gidget who is fed up with all the rules he had to live by when he flew combat missions, and dropped out of normal society. He travels the hemisphere surfing with his pet bird. Moondoggie admires Kahuna and wants to emulate him by joining Kahuna in working his way on a [[cargo ship|freighter]] to go [[surfing in Peru]] at summer's end, instead of going to university as his self-made father plans. Kahuna and Gidget enjoy each other's company, with Gidget questioning how he can survive an aimless and lonely existence without a job. She questions whether if Kahuna knew then what he knew now would he still make the same lifestyle choice after leaving the Air Force. Kahuna later reflects on Gidget's words after the death of his only friend, the pet bird.\n\nHoping to make Moondoggie jealous, Gidget hires one of the other surfers in the gang to be her date to a [[luau]] party on the beach. Her plan backfires when the surfer she hired pawns the job off on none other than Moondoggie, unaware that he was the one Gidget wanted to make jealous. Gidget lies and tells Moondoggie that it is Kahuna that she wants to make jealous, and they have a romantic evening at the luau. Eventually, Moondoggie says something that upsets Gidget and, as she flees the luau, she runs into Kahuna and agrees to take him to a nearby beach house. Alone with Kahuna, Gidget tries to make Kahuna take her [[virginity]]. Amused, Kahuna attempts to call Gidget's bluff by pretending to take her up on her offer, but finds himself falling under her spell. Realizing what he was about to do and angry at the situation he's been put in, Kahuna throws her out of the beach house just as Moondoggie arrives. Gidget is mortified and escapes out of the back of the beach house as Moondoggie confronts Kahuna. The cops are called to break up the fight between Kahuna and Moondoggie and, after leaving the beach house, they find Gidget stranded with a flat tire and without her driver's license. They take her in to the police station. Gidget's father, having heard about the incident, decides to take over control of her social life, and orders her not to see the surfer gang again. Gidget feels devastated at her failure, at which point her mother points out the needlepoint sampler from her grandmother, on her own bedroom wall. She rereads it: \"To Be A Real Woman / Is To Bring Out The / Best In A Man\".\n\nIn the end, her father arranges a date for Gidget with Jeffrey Matthews that she grudgingly accepts. To her surprise, Matthews turns out to be Moondoggie. The two return to the beach to find Kahuna tearing down his beach shack and find out that he has taken a job as an airline pilot. Moondoggie and Gidget realize how they feel about each other and, as an act of romantic devotion, Moondoggie asks Gidget to wear his class pin. Kahuna cheerfully warns Moondoggie that Gidget is quite a woman.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sandra Dee]] as [[Gidget|Francine \"Gidget\" Lawrence]]\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as [[Kahoona|Burt \"The Big Kahuna\" Vail]]\n* [[James Darren]] as [[Moondoggie|Jeffrey \"Moondoggie\" Matthews]]\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Russell Lawrence\n* [[The Four Preps]] as Band at Beach\n* [[Mary LaRoche]] as Dorothy Lawrence\n* [[Joby Baker]] as Stinky\n* [[Tom Laughlin]] as Lover Boy\n* Sue George<!--- not Susan George ---> as Betty \"B.

Great art it definitely isn't, but as frivolous, lighthearted entertainment, it more than fits the bill. Those who know it only by reputation will probably be surprised to find that it does attempt to deal with the problems of life as seen by a teenager\u2014and that, while some of those attempts are silly, many of them come off quite well. It also paints a very convincing picture of the beach-bum lifestyle, much more so than the [[Frankie Avalon]]&ndash;[[Annette Funicello]] beach party movies.\"<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/gidget-v19727 ''Allmovie'' review] Retrieved 15 October 2022.</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nOn November 10, 2017, [https://www.twilighttimemovies.com/gidget-blu-ray/ Twilight Time Movies] released Gidget (1959) on high-definition Blu-ray as a limited edition (3000 copies) release.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film received a 1960 Golden [[Laurel Award]] nomination for Top Female Comedy Performance for actress Sandra Dee.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1959]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n\n{{Gidget}}\n{{Paul Wendkos}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gidget (Film)}}\n[[Category:1959 films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1959 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s teen films]]\n[[Category:American teen romance films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Wendkos]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Gidget films]]\n[[Category:American surfing films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
