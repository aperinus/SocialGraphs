It stars [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Tara Reid]] and [[Ron Livingston]]. It tells the story of eight singles whose night of drunken debauchery goes terribly wrong.\n\n==Premise==\nA group of twenty-somethings are planning on going to a club for a night of fun.  The following morning, Sara ([[Tara Reid]]) accuses fellow clubber Mike ([[Jerry O'Connell]]) of date rape. The story of the previous evening is then told through two different points of view, one being how Sara remembers it, and the other how Mike remembers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as Rick Hamilton\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Michael Penorisi\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Jane Bannister\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Sara Olswang\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Trent\n* [[Emily Procter]] as Whitney Bryant\n* [[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]] as Shawn Denigan\n* [[Sybil Temtchine]] as Emma Cooper\n\n==Production==\n[[Tara Reid]] said the only reason she did a nude scene in this movie was because her character was getting raped: \"I'd never do a scene where my character takes off her shirt for no reason, for just a little T&A. That's stupid. That's exploiting yourself. I pass on a lot of movies where they want me to do nude stuff where it's not necessary for the role. It makes a film cheesy.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Starlet Wars |work=www.nydailynews.com |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/starlet-wars-article-1.878972 |access-date=2022-01-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was critically panned.
