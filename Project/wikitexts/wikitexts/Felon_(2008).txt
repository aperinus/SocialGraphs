The film stars [[Stephen Dorff]], [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Harold Perrineau]]. The film tells the story of the family man who ends up in [[Lists of United States state prisons|state prison]] after he kills an intruder. The story is based on events that took place in the 1990s at the notorious [[California State Prison, Corcoran]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=July 18, 2008|title=The Nightmare Disbelief of a Prisoner Under Siege|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/movies/18felo.html|access-date=August 20, 2021|authorlink=Stephen Holden}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on July 18, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nWade Porter is a blue-collar worker living with his fiance\u00e9 Laura and their son Michael. One night, they hear a burglar in the house while they're sleeping. Wade chases him out of the house and hits him in the head with a baseball bat, unintentionally killing him on his lawn. For attacking an unarmed intruder after he exited the house, he is arrested and charged with murder. At the urging of his [[public defender]], he enters a plea of [[no contest]] in exchange for a reduced sentence of three years for [[involuntary manslaughter]].\n\nDuring the bus ride to prison, Danny Sampson ([[Chris Browning]]), leader of the local [[Aryan Brotherhood]], stabs a man and hides the knife with a young Aryan member named Snowman who is sitting behind Wade. In a moment's panic, Snowman hides the knife under Wade's seat and forces him to deny knowledge of it. As a result, Wade is sent to solitary confinement until the stabbing can be investigated. Lieutenant Jackson interrogates Wade about the stabbing but he doesn't cooperate with the investigation. Jackson decides to send Wade to the Security Housing Unit (SHU) where he is the commanding officer.\n\nJohn Smith is serving a life sentence at [[San Quentin State Prison]] and is transferred to Wade's prison, becoming his cellmate in the [[Security Housing Unit|Security Housing Unit (SHU)]]. Inmates in the SHU are under 23-hour lock-down and not permitted to have visitors for the first three months. Wade realizes that the daily hour of yard time consists of inmate fights, on which the officers bet. At different points throughout the film, it's shown that not all of the officers are in favor of Jackson's methods.\n\nIn addition to the prison violence, Wade's regular visits with Laura start to take their toll on their relationship. Michael has nightmares after one of his visits, and the family's finances are running low. After Wade refuses to identify Sampson as the perpetrator of the murder on the bus, Jackson [[Perjury|falsely testifies]] that he was an accessory to the murder, resulting in an additional three years being added to his existing sentence. Laura, at the encouragement of her mother, breaks off the relationship with Wade through a letter. Broken and enraged, Wade resorts to fighting the prisoners in exchange for protection from Sampson and the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nAfter talking to John, Wade devises a plan that can reveal the truth about the violence in the prison, and possibly get him released. During the next yard time, Wade refuses to kill an inmate after defeating him in a fight. A furious Jackson enters the yard and prepares to attack Wade, but Smith kills him by severing his [[femoral artery]] and throat with a concealed [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]]. Another yard officer then shoots Smith, who dies from his wounds. With the help of a retired correctional officer at Smith's former prison, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and Laura, the corruption of the prison officers is exposed and Wade's additional sentence is [[Commutation (law)|commuted]]. He is released after 15 months in prison and reunited with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Stephen Dorff]] as Wade Porter\n*[[Marisol Nichols]] as Laura Porter\n*Vincent Miller as Michael Porter\n*[[Val Kilmer]] as John Smith\n*[[Harold Perrineau]] as Lieutenant Bill Jackson\n*[[Greg Serano]] as Officer Diaz\n*[[Johnny Lewis]] as Jake 'Snowman'\n*[[Nate Parker]] as Officer James Collins\n*[[Nick Chinlund]] as Sergeant Roberts\n*[[Anne Archer]] as Maggie\n*[[Sam Shepard]] as Gordon\n*[[Chris Browning]] as Danny Sampson\n*Jake Walker as Warden Frank Harris\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIt is set and filmed in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in 24 days on October 9 and November 2, 2007.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.45/10.
