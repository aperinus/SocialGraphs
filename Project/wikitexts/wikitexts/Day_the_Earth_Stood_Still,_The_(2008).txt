He loses consciousness and when he wakes, the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken.\n\nIn the present day, a rapidly moving object is detected beyond [[Jupiter]]'s orbit and forecast to impact [[Manhattan]]. It is moving at 30,000 kilometers per second, fast enough that its impact would destroy all life on [[Earth]]. The [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] hastily assembles a group of scientists, including Helen Benson and her friend Michael Granier, to develop a survival plan.\n\nThe scientists travel to [[New York City]] to await the object's collision with Earth. As it nears the planet, the object slows down just before impact. Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship, it lands gently in [[Central Park]] and is quickly surrounded by [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] and heavily armed [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] forces. An [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it; but amidst the confusion, the alien is shot. A gigantic humanoid robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity by emitting a high-pitched noise before the wounded alien voices the command \"[[Klaatu barada nikto]]\" to shut down the robot's defensive response.\n\nThe alien's exterior is found to be a [[bioengineered]] space suit, composed of [[placenta]]-like material covering a human-like being. After the bullet is extracted during surgery, the being quickly ages into [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]], who looks like the mountaineer from 1928. Klaatu informs [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations, sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet. When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated, Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson, Jacob, telling them that he must finish his mission to \"save the Earth\".\n\nThe presence of the sphere and other smaller spheres that begin to appear all over the world cause widespread panic. The military launches a [[drone attack]] on the Central Park sphere, but is thwarted by the robot. The military takes a weapons-free approach, cautiously enclosing the robot, soon nicknamed \"[[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|GORT]]\" (for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology), and transporting it to the [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|Mount Weather]] underground facility in Virginia.\n\nKlaatu meets with another alien, Mr. Wu, who has lived on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive, stubborn, and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind. When a [[New Jersey State Police|New Jersey State Trooper]] attempts to take them into custody, Klaatu kills him and then promptly revives the officer, telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.\n\nHoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity, Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt, a [[Nobel Prize]] winner. They discuss how Klaatu's race went through drastic, collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their planet. Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice, and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change. While the adults are talking, Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu.\n\nWhile the military is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of winged insect-like [[Nanorobotics|nano-machines]] that self-replicate as they [[Grey goo|consume every man-made object in their path]]. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.\n\nThe military captures Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot. As they travel, Klaatu learns more about humanity through Jacob. When Jacob contacts Helen and arranges to meet at his father's grave, the Secretary sends her to try to change Klaatu's mind. At the grave, Jacob is heartbroken that Klaatu cannot resurrect his long-dead father. As Helen and Jacob have a tear-filled reunion, Klaatu's cumulative observations of humans convince him to stop the swarm.\n\nGranier drives them to the Central Park sphere, but the swarm has reached massive proportions. Klaatu trudges through the swarm to the sphere, touching it moments before his own body is consumed. The sphere deactivates the swarm, saving humanity, but at the expense of electrical activity on Earth, per Klaatu's warning that there will be \"a price to the [human] way of life.\"<!-- It is not possible to say whether or not steam power would still work, nor winches and other mechanical apparatus.

The script had specified the inside of the orbs as a \"white limbo-y thing\", but visual-effects consultant Jeff Okun explained this was deleted for being too \"cheesy\".<ref name=setvisit/> Derrickson felt not showing the inside of the ship, unlike the original, would make the audience more curious.<ref name=notes/> As well as computer-generated spheres\u2014such as Klaatu's {{convert|300|ft|adj=on}} ship, or a {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} orb that rises from the sea\u2014{{convert|700|lb|adj=on}} spheres, {{convert|9|ft}} in diameter, were sculpted by Custom Plastics, which built spheres for Disney theme parks. The spheres were split in two to make transportation easier. It was difficult placing lights inside them without making them melt. The visual-effects team looked at natural objects, including water droplets and the surfaces of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] for the spheres' texture.<ref name=notes/>\n\nDerrickson emphasized a [[Trinity]]-like relationship between the sphere, Klaatu, and Gort.<ref name=setqaa/> Klaatu is initially depicted as a radiant focus of sentient light. He is then depicted as a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} gray \"walking womb\" shape which finally takes on a completely human appearance. The filmmakers conceived the transitional form because they pondered the idea of humans mistaking space suits for alien skin. Computer-generated imagery and practical effects achieved the transformation.<ref name=notes/> Todd Masters (''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'') directed the creation of the alien form, using thermal plastic and silicone.<ref name=setvisit/>\n\nThe script described Gort as [[nanotechnology]] by the time the director signed on, although it did not specify Gort's appearance.<ref>\n{{cite news|author=Heather Newgen|title=Making the Earth Stand Still|work=ComingSoon.net|date=December 10, 2008|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=50987|access-date=December 10, 2008}}\n</ref> The 15th draft of the script<ref name=tf/> had depicted the robot as a four-legged \"[[Totem pole|Totem]]\" that stands upright after firing its weapon beam.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/36336|title=No Gort!!

He cited the [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]] from the 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as an inspiration for Gort's texture, noting \"it's a simple shape, it has no emotion [...] it just simply is\",<ref name=empire/> which makes Gort more frightening because the audience cannot tell what he is thinking. The animators estimated the computer-generated robot as {{convert|28|ft}} tall, whereas in the original he was played by the {{convert|7|ft|7|in|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[Lock Martin]].<ref name=notes/> Gort's computer model was programmed to reflect light, and the filmmakers spent time on [[motion-capture]] sessions to guide the performance. An actor wore weights on his hands and feet, allowing the animators to bring a sense of weight and power to Gort.<ref name=notes/> His destructive capabilities were based on [[locust]] swarms, although the idea of metal-eating insects goes back to [[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]]'s 1933 poem \"Metropolitan Nightmare\".<ref name=tf/>\n\n==Music==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\n{{Further|The Day the Earth Stood Still (soundtrack)#Remake soundtrack}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[Tyler Bates]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2008|12|16}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 52:43\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n'''''The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was orchestrated and conducted by [[Timothy Williams (Composer)|Timothy Williams]]. [[Tyler Bates]] was brought in to compose the score for ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' after Derrickson heard his work on ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'' (2006). Instead of imitating the [[The Day the Earth Stood Still (soundtrack)|original score]] by [[Bernard Herrmann]], Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Bates said,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} \"People revere an original property and feel that it's sacred, but frankly, there's a good story to be retold, as it applies to the climate of the world now. If that's something beyond the scope of a person's ability to take in, on a new level, without necessarily using the original as a criterion for whether or not they're going to enjoy it, then they probably shouldn't bother themselves with it.\" The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When he got back to [[Los Angeles]], he created a sound loop on his [[GuitarViol]] to which Derrickson responded, \"I think that's the score!\", when it was played for him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/12/31/at-the-precipace-we-change-tyler-bates-music-to-make-the-earth-stand-still |title=Tyler Bates on Score Day the Earth Stood Still |author=Larson, Randall |date=December 31, 2008 |work=Cinefantastique |access-date=May 7, 2009}}</ref> Bates utilized the [[theremin]], which Herrmann heavily used for the original film's score.
