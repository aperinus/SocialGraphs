[[Laurie Zimmer]], [[Tony Burton]], [[Martin West (actor)|Martin West]], and [[Nancy Kyes]] co-star as other defenders of the precinct.\n\nCarpenter was approached by producer J. Stein Kaplan to make a low-budget [[exploitation film]] for under $100,000, on the condition that Carpenter would have total creative control. Carpenter's script, originally titled ''The Anderson Alamo'', was inspired by the [[Howard Hawks]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' and the [[George A. Romero]] horror film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''. Despite controversy with the [[MPAA]] over a scene involving the violent killing of a young girl, the film received an R rating and opened in the United States on November 5, 1976.\n\n''Assault on Precinct 13'' was initially met with mixed reviews and unimpressive box-office returns in the United States, but when the film premiered in the 1977 [[London Film Festival]], it received an ecstatic review by festival director Ken Wlaschin that led to critical acclaim first in Britain and then throughout Europe. It has garnered a [[cult following]] and reappraisal from critics, with many evaluating the film as one of the best action films of its era and of Carpenter's career. A [[Assault on Precinct 13 (2005 film)|remake]] was released in 2005, directed by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet]] and starring [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[South Los Angeles|South-Central Los Angeles]], a local gang, Street Thunder, steals a cache of assault rifles and pistols. At 3:00 am on a Saturday in Anderson, a crime-infested ghetto, a team of heavily-armed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers ambush and kill six members of the gang. Later, the gang's four warlords swear a blood oath of revenge against the police and the citizens of Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the day, three sequences of events occur parallel to one another: First, Lieutenant Ethan Bishop, a newly promoted [[California Highway Patrol|highway patrol]] officer, is assigned to take charge of the decommissioned Anderson police precinct during the last few hours before it is permanently closed. Only a skeleton staff remains, composed of Sergeant Chaney and the station's two secretaries, Leigh and Julie. Across town, two of the Street Thunder warlords, along with two other gang members, drive around the neighborhood looking for people to kill. One of the warlords shoots and kills a little girl, Kathy, and the driver of an ice-cream truck. Kathy's father, Lawson, pursues and kills the warlord and the other gang members chase him into the Anderson precinct. In shock, Lawson is unable to communicate to Bishop or Chaney what has happened to him.\n\nJust before this, a prison bus commanded by Starker stops at the station to find medical help for one of three prisoners being transported to the state prison. The prisoners are Napoleon Wilson, Wells, and Caudell, who is sick. As the prisoners are put into cells, the telephone lines go dead, and when Starker prepares to put the prisoners back on the bus, the gang opens fire on the precinct, using weapons fitted with silencers. In seconds, they kill Chaney, the bus driver, Caudell, Starker, and the two officers accompanying Starker. Bishop unchains Wilson from Starker's body and puts Wilson and Wells back into the cells. When the gang members cut the station's electricity and begin a second wave of shooting, Bishop sends Leigh to release Wells and Wilson, and they help Bishop and Leigh repel an attempted invasion, though Julie is killed in the firefight and Leigh is shot in one arm.\n\nMeanwhile, the gang members remove all evidence of the skirmish to avoid attracting outside attention. Bishop hopes that someone has heard the police weapons firing, but the neighborhood is too sparsely populated for nearby residents to pinpoint the location of the noise. Wells is chosen to sneak out of the precinct through the sewer line and hot-wire a car, but is killed by a gang member hiding in the back seat. However, two police officers responding to reports of gunfire find the dead body of a telephone repairman hanging from a pole near the police station and call for backup.\n\nAs the gang rallies for an all-out final assault, Wilson, Leigh, and Bishop retreat to the basement, taking the still-catatonic Lawson with them. The gang then storms the building and rushes the survivors, who protect themselves with a large, durable sign. Bishop shoots a tank full of acetylene gas, which explodes and kills all the gang members in the basement. The remainder of the gang flees as more police support arrives to secure the station. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of dead and badly-burned gang members strewn about the hallway; the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and Lawson. Lawson is wheeled out on a stretcher, while Leigh refuses medical help for the gunshot wound in her arm and walks off. An officer tries to cuff Wilson, but Bishop angrily stops him and asks Wilson to walk out of the station with him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Austin Stoker]] as Lieutenant Ethan Bishop\n* [[Darwin Joston]] as Napoleon Wilson\n* [[Laurie Zimmer]] as Leigh\n* [[Martin West (actor)|Martin West]] as Mr. Lawson\n* [[Tony Burton]] as Wells\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Special Officer Starker\n* [[Nancy Kyes|Nancy Loomis]] as Julie\n* Peter Bruni as Ice Cream Man\n* John J.

Stein Kaplan. After reviewing the first draft of ''Assault'' and following the sale of the script ''Eyes'' to [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Jon Peters]], later renamed ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'', Kaplan and Kaufman concentrated on just ''Assault''. \"J. Stein Kaplan was a friend of mine from [[University of Southern California|USC]],\" said Carpenter. \"He knew Joseph Kaufman from his days in Philadelphia \u2026 Basically their fathers were funding ''Assault on Precinct 13''\". The two families of the producers formed the CKK Corporation to finance the film.{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=85}}{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=89}}<ref name=stills>Kaufman, Joseph (2003).

The score consists of two main themes: the main title theme, with its familiar synthesizer melody, and a slower contemplative theme used in the film's more subdued scenes. Besides these two themes, the soundtrack also features a series of ominous drones and primal drum patterns, which often represent the anonymous gang gathering in the shadows. --> Carpenter, assisted by [[Dan Wyman]], had several banks of synthesizers that would each have to be reset when another sound had to be created, taking a great deal of time.<ref name=Carpenter/>{{sfn|Muir|2000|p=11}} \"When I did my original themes for [''Assault''] \u2026 it was done with very old technology,\" replied Carpenter. \"It was very difficult to get the sounds, and it took very long to get something simple.\"{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=56}} Carpenter made roughly three to five separate pieces of music and edited them to the film as appropriate.<ref name=Q&A/>\n\nThe main title theme, partially inspired by both [[Lalo Schifrin]]'s score to ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Immigrant Song]]\",<ref name=NME/> is composed of a pop synthesizer riff with a drum machine underneath that \"builds only in texture, but not thematically,\" according to David Burnand and Miguel Mera. A held, high synthesizer note, with no other changes except inner frequency modulations, becomes the musical motif of the gang members, and reoccurs during certain violent acts in the film. In the film, synthesizers and drum machines represent the city and the gang.<ref name=CW-56/><ref name=CW-57>Conrich; Woods, 2004, p. 57.</ref>\n\nCarpenter also uses a plaintive electric piano theme when Lt. Bishop first enters the abandoned precinct. It reoccurs in the film during the quiet moments of the siege, becoming in effect a musical articulation of rhythm of the siege itself.<ref name=CW-55>Conrich; Woods, 2004, p. 55.</ref> Bishop is heard whistling the tune of this particular theme at the beginning and end of the film, making the electric piano theme \"a non-diegetic realization of a diegetic source.\"<ref name=CW-56>Conrich; Woods, 2004, p. 56.</ref> Burnand and Mera have noted that \"there is some attempt to show the common denominators of human behavior regardless of 'tribal' affiliations, and there is a clear attempt to represent this through simple musical devices.\"<ref name=CW-58>Conrich; Woods, 2004, p. 58.</ref>\n\nMany film critics who praised the film also praised the musical score by Carpenter. As John Kenneth Muir noted, \"Carpenter wrote the riveting musical score for ''Assault''... The final result was a unique, synthetic sound that is still quite catchy, even after 20 years \u2026 Delightfully, it even serves as a counterpoint in one important scene.\"{{sfn|Muir|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Muir|2000|p=70}} Dave Goldner of ''SFX'' wrote that ''Assault'' had \"one of the most catchy theme tunes in film history.\"<ref name=Goldner-1996/> In early 2004, Piers Martin of [[NME]] wrote that Carpenter's minimalist synthesizer score accounted for much of the film's tense and menacing atmosphere and its \"impact, 27 years on, is still being felt.\"<ref name=NME>Martin, Piers (January 10, 2004). \"John Carpenter ''Assault on Precinct 13'' Soundtrack\".

Beyond its use in the film, the score is often cited as an influence on various [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists with its main title theme being sampled by artists including [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[Dead Prez]], and [[Bomb the Bass]].<ref name=stills/>{{rp|192}}<ref name=RM/><ref>[[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Chang, Jeff]] (January 27, 2005).

Chance, the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo''; his frequent collaborator [[Debra Hill]] served as assistant editor.<ref name=stills/>{{rp|49}} According to Carpenter, the editing process was a bare-bones process. One mistake Carpenter was not proud of was one shot \"cut out of frame\", which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it. ''Assault'' was shot on [[Panavision]], which takes up the entire negative, and edited on [[Moviola]], which cannot show the whole image, so if a cut was made improperly (i.e., frame line not lined up properly), then one would cut a half of a sprocket into the film and \"cut out of frame,\" as happened to Carpenter. In the end, it did not matter because he said, \"It was so dark, no one could see it, thank God!\"<ref name=Q&A/>\n\n[[Tommy Lee Wallace]], the film's art director, spoke admiringly about Carpenter during post. \"[Carpenter] asked if I could cut sound effects. The answer, of course, was 'Sure!' Once again, here I was, a perfectly green recruit, yet John made a leap of faith \u2026 he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary [[MGM]] color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best post-production sound money could buy, which was [[Samuel Goldwyn]] Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting people to pay for processing\u2014 and it was true.\"{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=17}}\n\n==Release==\nAlthough the film's title is ''Assault on Precinct 13'', the action mainly takes place in a police station referred to as Precinct 9, Division 13, by Bishop's staff sergeant over the radio. The film's distributor was responsible for the misnomer. Carpenter originally called the film ''The Anderson Alamo''<ref name=stills/> before briefly changing the title to ''The Siege'' to shop to distributors.{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=85}}{{#tag:ref|''[[The Siege]]'' was later used as the title of another controversial film, a 1998 drama about terrorist attacks in the U.S. starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Denzel Washington]].|group=\"a\"}} The film was acquired by [[Irwin Yablans]].{{sfn|Boulenger|2003|p=85}} During post-production, however, the distributor rejected Carpenter's title in favor of the film's present name.
