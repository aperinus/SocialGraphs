The film is the [[sequel]] to 2007's ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', as well as the second installment in the [[live action|live-action]] [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]. Taking place two years after the first film, the story revolves around [[Optimus Prime]] (voiced by [[Peter Cullen]]), leader of the Autobots, and [[Sam Witwicky]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), who is caught once again in the war between the [[Autobot]]s and the [[Decepticon]]s, led by [[Megatron]] (voiced by [[Hugo Weaving]]). Sam begins having strange visions of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named [[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]] (voiced by [[Tony Todd]]), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Megatron, Starscream, and Scorponok.\n\nWith deadlines jeopardized by possible strikes by the [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]], Bay managed to finish the production on time with the help of [[previsualization]] and a [[scriptment]] by his writers [[Roberto Orci]], [[Alex Kurtzman]], and series newcomer [[Ehren Kruger]]. Shooting took place between May and September 2008, with locations in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and [[California]], as well as [[Military air base|air bases]] in [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]. It is the last film in the series to star [[Megan Fox]], and is also the last film in the series to be co-produced by [[DreamWorks Pictures]], leaving [[Paramount Pictures]] as the sole distributor of its future sequels.\n\n''Revenge of the Fallen'' premiered on June 8, 2009 in [[Tokyo]] and was released on June 24, 2009 in the United States. Critical reception was negative, with critics considering it to be inferior to the first film. Criticism aimed at the film's plot, screenplay, crude humor, offensive racial stereotypes, characters, and runtime, but the visual effects and sound design received praise. The film won three [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] at the [[30th Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] award. The film surpassed its predecessor at the box office, grossing a total of $402.1 million in the US and Canada and $434.2 million in other territories, for a total of $836.3 million worldwide, making it the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|37th highest-grossing domestic film]] and [[2009 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest of the year]] worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the [[List of best-selling films in the United States|top-selling film of the year in the United States]]. It was followed by ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 17,000 B.C., the Primes (the original Autobots) got their energy from sun harvesters, machines that consume stars to harness their energy. The Primes vowed never to deplete a star that sustains life. One Prime attempted to violate this rule by building a sun harvester on Earth, for which he was imprisoned by the other six Primes, becoming \"The Fallen\", the original Decepticon.\n\nIn 2009, two years after the battle of [[Transformers (film)|Mission City]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' (2007).}} the [[Autobots]] and the humans have formed NEST (Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty), a classified international task force to eliminate the remaining [[Decepticons]]. Two of them, Sideways and Demolisher, are defeated in [[Shanghai]], but the latter declares \"The Fallen shall rise again.\" before being killed. Meanwhile, the Decepticon Soundwave hacks a military satellite. The Decepticons steal the last known piece of the AllSpark shard from a [[United States Navy|Navy]] base and use it to resurrect Megatron while killing one of their own to provide parts for his body. The Fallen sends Megatron and his second-in-command, [[Starscream]], to capture [[Sam Witwicky]] alive and kill Optimus.\n\nSam, now a college student, has been seeing Cybertronian symbols since holding a smaller AllSpark shard; Megatron believes the symbols will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source. The shard brings many of the kitchen appliances to life and they try to kill Sam and his parents but [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] rescues them. Sam gives the shard to his girlfriend [[List of Transformers film series characters|Mikaela Banes]], who later captures the Decepticon [[Lists of Transformers characters|Wheelie]] as he attempts to steal it. After being attacked by Alice, a Decepticon Pretender posing as a college student (whom they manage to kill), Sam, his roommate Leo and Mikaela are captured by the Decepticon Grindor before Optimus and Bumblebee save them. Megatron then kills Optimus (but not before he kills Grindor) and the Decepticons launch devastating, simultaneous attacks around the world, while Megatron and Soundwave hijack Earth's [[telecommunication]]s systems, which allows The Fallen to send a message to the humans, demanding that Sam be handed over to him.\n\nSam, Mikaela and Leo then find alien expert and former Sector Seven agent, \"Robo-Warrior\" Seymour Simmons, who reveals the Transformers [[Ancient astronauts|visited]] Earth [[Aeon|eons]] ago and the most ancient, known as [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seekers]], remained hidden on Earth. With help from Wheelie, they track down an elderly Decepticon turned Autobot Seeker named [[Jetfire#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Jetfire]] at the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]]. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to [[Egypt]]. Along with Jetfire, Wheelie sides with the Autobots, and Jetfire sends them to locate the [[Matrix of Leadership]], the sun harvester's key, which could also be used to revive Optimus. The group finds the Matrix, whom the Primes sacrificed themselves to hide, in [[Petra]], but it disintegrates into dust.\n \nMeanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and are attacked by the Decepticons. The Constructicons combine to form [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters|Devastator]], who reveals the sun harvester hidden inside a pyramid before he is destroyed. A majority of the Decepticons are annihilated, mostly with multiple [[Carpet bombing|airstrikes]] from the Navy and the Air Force, but Megatron badly injures Sam. Near-death, the Primes speak to Sam, saying that the Matrix must be earned, not found and that he has the right to bear it by fighting for Optimus. They revive Sam and grant him the Matrix, which he uses to restore Optimus. The Fallen steals the Matrix from a weakened Optimus and uses it to activate the sun harvester. After Jetfire (who was wounded by Scorponok, but was able to kill his attacker) sacrifices himself to allow his parts to be used for additional power and flight, Optimus destroys the harvester and kills The Fallen. Heavily damaged and distraught by his master's death, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The Autobots and their allies then return to the [[United States]], and Sam and Leo return to college.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Transformers film series cast and characters}}\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Sam Witwicky: A recent high school graduate who is unwittingly drawn again into the Autobot cause to unravel an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed Allspark.\n* [[Megan Fox]] as Mikaela Banes: Sam's girlfriend whom he trusts as the Allspark fragments begin to unravel.\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as William Lennox: A [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|U.S. Army]] Special Forces [[Major]] who establishes NEST to help the Autobots in their battle against the remaining Decepticons.\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Robert Epps: A [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] Master Sergeant and Combat Controller in Lennox's team who leads NEST's SWAT unit.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Seymour Simmons: A former agent of the recently terminated Sector 7 who now runs a meat shop in [[New York City]] with his mother, Tova Simmons.\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ramon Rodriguez]] as Leo Spitz: A college roommate of Sam's who runs an online conspiracy blog and is obsessed with the Transformers.\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Ron Witwicky: Sam's father.\n* [[Julie White]] as Judith Witwicky: Sam's mother.\n* [[Isabel Lucas]] as Alice: A female [[Pretenders (Transformers)|pretender]] sent to spy on Sam in college.\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Theodore Galloway: A national security adviser who often chastises NEST and the Autobots for their destructive tactics.\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as General Morshower: The supervisor of NEST.\n* [[Matthew Marsden]] as Graham: a [[British Army]] NEST officer.\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Professor R.A.
