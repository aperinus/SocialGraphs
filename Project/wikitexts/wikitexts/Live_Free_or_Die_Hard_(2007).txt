It is based on the 1997 article \"A Farewell to Arms\" written for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine by [[John Carlin (journalist)|John Carlin]]. The film's name is adapted from [[New Hampshire]]'s [[state motto]], \"[[Live Free or Die]]\".\n\nIn the film, NYPD Detective [[John McClane]] ([[Bruce Willis]]) attempts to stop a cyber-terrorist ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) who hacks into government and commercial computers across the United States with the goal of starting a \"[[Fire sale (disambiguation)|fire sale]]\" that would disable key elements of the nation's infrastructure. [[Justin Long]], [[Cliff Curtis]], and [[Maggie Q]] also star.\n\n''Live Free or Die Hard'' was released in the United States on June 27, 2007. The film grossed $388 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing installment in the ''Die Hard'' series. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who called the film a return to form for the series. It is the only ''Die Hard'' film to be theatrically released with a PG-13 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]], although an unrated edition would later be made available on home media. A fifth film, ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', was released in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nResponding to a brief computer outage at its Cyber-Security Division by tracking down top [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], led by Deputy Director Miguel Bowman, asks [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective [[John McClane]] to go to [[New Jersey]] to bring in hacker Matthew Farrell. McClane arrives just in time to save him from assassins sent by Mai Linh, who is the lover and accomplice of Thomas Gabriel, a hacker and leader of the terrorists.\n\nOn the way to [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]], Farrell tells McClane he had written an [[algorithm]] for Linh to crack a specific security system for [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] purposes. Meanwhile, Gabriel orders his crew of hackers to take over transportation grids and the stock market, while nationally broadcasting a threatening message to the U.S. government. Farrell realizes this is the start of a \"[[fire sale (disambiguation)|fire sale]]\", a [[Cyberwarfare|cyber attack]] designed to disable the nation's [[infrastructure]]. As McClane and Farrell are driven to [[Homeland security|DHS]] headquarters, Linh, posing as a dispatcher, reroutes them into a helicopter ambush. McClane fends off the attackers, destroying the helicopter and all but one of the terrorists.\n\nDesperate, McClane asks Farrell what would be Gabriel's next move. He deduces Gabriel's next target is the power grid, so they drive to a utility superstation in [[West Virginia]]. They find the superstation under control by a team led by Linh. McClane kills all but Linh. After an intense, violent struggle between the two, Linh, trapped in a car, is killed when the vehicle falls down an elevator shaft.\n\nWhile Farrell is working on the hub computer to slow down the damage done, he is able to trace Gabriel and uploads his picture. He then sends it to Bowman at the FBI. McClane is shocked to learn that Bowman and Gabriel once worked together at the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Gabriel was the chief programmer for infrastructural security. He warned the department of weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to [[cyberwarfare]], but he was ignored and his unorthodox methods got him fired, and he is out for revenge. Enraged over Linh's death, Gabriel redirects large amounts of natural gas to the superstation to kill McClane and Farrell, but they barely escape.\n\nMcClane and Farrell then travel by helicopter to the home of super hacker, Frederick \"Warlock\" Kaludis in [[Baltimore]]. Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote for Linh as a means to access data at a [[Social Security Administration]] building at [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn, Maryland]]. He confirms Gabriel's former ties as a government employee. Doing a [[traceroute]], Warlock locates Gabriel.\n\nThe Woodlawn building is actually an [[National Security Agency|NSA]] facility intended to back up the nation's personal and financial records in the event of a cyber attack and designed by Gabriel himself. The attack on the FBI triggered a download of financial data to Woodlawn, data which Gabriel plans to steal. Meanwhile, ordered by Gabriel, one of his top men kills all but one of his computer hackers after they've outlived their usefulness. Gabriel then taps into the connection they made, which reveals the location of McClane's estranged daughter Lucy, whom he kidnaps. McClane and Gabriel then meet - virtually - McClane telling him he will lose.\n\nMcClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility. Farrell finds the facility's main server and encrypts the data Gabriel's men downloaded before getting captured. Gabriel then takes Farrell and Lucy with him as he flees. McClane pursues them, hijacking their [[Semi-trailer truck|semi]] mobile base. Accessing the communication system of an [[F-35B|F-35B Lightning II]], Gabriel orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving, but the jet is destroyed by falling debris. McClane barely survives and sees Gabriel's vehicle pull into a nearby hangar. He contacts the FBI and orders the director to storm the facility where Gabriel is situated and rescue his daughter if he doesn't make it out alive.\n\nThere, Gabriel demands that Farrell decrypt the financial data. When he refuses, Gabriel shoots him in the knee and threatens to kill Lucy. McClane arrives, killing two of Gabriel's men, but he is shot in the shoulder by Gabriel's last man, Emerson. Gabriel positions himself behind McClane, putting the barrel of the gun in his shoulder wound. McClane then pulls the trigger. The bullet travels through McClane's shoulder and hits Gabriel in the chest, killing him instantly. Farrell then grabs a pistol and kills Emerson as the FBI arrives. Afterwards, McClane thanks Farrell for saving Lucy's life, who takes a romantic interest in him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Detective [[John McClane]] of the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]].  He becomes involved in stopping Thomas Gabriel after being tasked with transporting Matt Farrell to the FBI for questioning.

As they did with original scripts for the previous three films, Fox and Willis decided to pick a script which was not written as a ''Die Hard'' film and then have it changed into the next sequel. In 1997, they picked up a script titled ''Tears of the Sun'', an action-adventure written by [[Alan B. McElroy]], which Willis really liked and wanted to turn into ''Die Hard 4''. The script was about a group of people who go to set up a radio relay station deep inside the Amazon jungle; due to a severe storm, they land in a small mining town where they hire a guide. However, they are soon captured by a drug lord and his gang, who force them to work as slaves in his mine. They manage to escape and have to survive both the jungle and drug dealers who are chasing them.<ref>''[[Starlog]]'' #242, September 1997, Page 31</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/34650/willis-to-die-hard-for-25-million |title=Willis to \"Die Hard\" for $25 Million |first=Ken |last=Neville |date=June 6, 1997 |quote=Word on the street is that the film will be set in the jungle and be based on a script called Tears of the Sun written by Chris Gerolmo, who wrote and directed the 1995 HBO flick Citizen X.

It's really weird how all this stuff happens.\" |website=[[eonline.com]]}}</ref>\n\nAt the time Fox decided to rework the story into ''Die Hard 4'', ''Tears of the Sun'' had been in development since the early 1990s. Around 1994, it was one of several projects to which [[John Woo]] was attached as a director, but which never got made. Besides McElroy, some of the other writers who worked on the ''Tears of the Sun'' script over the years included [[Ronald Bass]], [[Chris Gerolmo]], [[Larry Ferguson]], [[Robert Mark Kamen]] and Joel Gross. It was also at one point considered to be re-written into a new modern adaptation of ''Tarzan'', before Fox got the script.<ref>''Starlog'' #177, April 1992, Page 33</ref><ref>''Starlog'' #242, September 1997, Page 31</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://variety.com/1993/film/news/fox-mulls-playing-pat-hand-tristar-woos-woo-102864/ | title=Fox mulls playing 'Pat' hand; TriStar woos Woo | date=12 January 1993 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/11/02/Fox-signs-Woo-to-production-deal/1981783752400/ | title=Fox signs Woo to production deal }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/foreign-films-4-99124305/ | title=Foreign Films | date=6 March 1995 }}</ref>\n\nInterestingly, one of the first rejected scripts for the third ''Die Hard'' film, written by [[John Milius]], also took place in the jungle. As with that script, the ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'' version of ''Die Hard 4'' was never made.\n\nWillis liked the ''Tears of the Sun'' title so much that he requested that one of his films, made in 2002, be re-titled ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'' (instead of ''Hostile Rescue'' or ''Man of War'') in exchange for starring in another ''Die Hard'' film. This is why it is often mistakenly reported that ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'' was originally going to be the fourth ''[[Die Hard]]'' film.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/1039 | title=Tidbits from all over }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/44006/willis-ready-to-die-hardest |title=Willis Ready to \"Die Hardest\" |first=Josh |last=Grossberg |date=October 11, 2002 |quote=Willis' next project, an action drama directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), was originally called Tears of the Sun. In the film, the former barkeep and Moonlighting vet stars as a special-ops commander charged with rescuing a doctor (Italian babe Monica Bellucci) in the jungles of Nigeria. But apparently feeling that Tears of the Sun sounds a bit too much like some three-hanky melodrama, the suits at Revolution Studios and the film's producers decided to change the title to Hostile Rescue and then to Man of War. Enter Fox, which owns the rights to a property with the Man of War moniker. The studio reportedly offered to fork over the War title. In return, producer Arnold Rifkin's Cheyenne Enterprises would have to agree to devise yet another Die Hard scenario for Willis. |website=eonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Confessions of a Hollywood Nobody |first=Dan |last=Bronson |at=Chapters 85 and 86}}</ref>\n\n===Script and title===\nThe film's plot is based on an earlier script entitled ''WW3.com'' by [[David Marconi]], screenwriter of the 1998 film ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]''.<ref name=\"VarietyTentpole\">{{cite news|last=Petrikin |first=Chris |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467113.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Fox eyes 'WW3.com' as tentpole for 1999 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 27, 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220610113504/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467113 |archive-date=June 10, 2022 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Using John Carlin's ''Wired'' magazine article entitled \"A Farewell to Arms\", Marconi crafted a screenplay about a cyber-terrorist attack on the United States.<ref name=\"SciFiNews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue175/news.html|title=Besson To Develop WW3.com|publisher=[[Syfy]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605194811/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue175/news.html|archive-date=June 5, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"FarewellArms\">{{cite magazine|author-link=John Carlin (journalist) |last=Carlin |first=John |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/netizen.html |title=A Farewell to Arms |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=May 1997 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629021309/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/netizen.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The attack procedure is known as a \"fire sale\", depicting a three-stage coordinated attack on a country's transportation, telecommunications, financial, and utilities infrastructure systems.
