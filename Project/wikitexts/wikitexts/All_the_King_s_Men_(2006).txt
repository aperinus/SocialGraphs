''All the King's Men'' had previously been adapted into a [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]]\u2013winning [[All the King's Men (1949 film)|film]] by writer-director [[Robert Rossen]] in 1949. The film narrates the rise to power and dramatic demise of the ruthless Governor Willie Stark (played by [[Sean Penn]]), taking his office in the [[American South]]. The fictional character is loosely based on the life of [[Governor of Louisiana|Louisiana governor]] [[Huey Long]], in office between 1928 through 1932. Elected as a U.S. senator, he was assassinated in 1935. The film co-stars [[Jude Law]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[James Gandolfini]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Patricia Clarkson]] and [[Jackie Earle Haley]].\n\n==Plot==\nJack Burden, a [[Louisiana]] news reporter, takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer and [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]] treasurer. Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for [[Governor (U.S.)|governor]]. Burden's upbringing makes him familiar with the undercurrent of politics \u2013 he was raised by his loving [[Godparent|godfather]] Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while his good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and his sister Anne Stanton\u2014also Burden's former lover\u2014are the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy's advice and travels as a reporter on Stark's campaign for governor.\n\nThe politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split his party's vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to him by Duffy. His vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for his \"fellow ignorant hicks\", resulting in Stark winning the election. He manages Duffy by making him his lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for him as an adviser.\n\nStark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of his new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible [[Graft (politics)|graft]] in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite's word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells his crowds that his \"crooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty\" compared to the elite's. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while he begins having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke's jealousy and Burden's disappointment.\n\nIrwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a [[bribe]] that Irwin used to get his appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin himself commits suicide. Burden's mother then tells him that Irwin treated him with such love because he was his biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden.\n\nStark utilizes many methods of [[corruption]] to consolidate his power, including [[patronage]] and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing him in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when he learns of Stark's affair with his sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor's bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:All the kings men image.jpg|thumb|Jude Law (left) and Sean Penn in the film]]\n{{cast list|\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Willie Stark\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jack Burden\n** Joshua Davis as young Jack\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Anne Stanton\n** Carrie Christmann as young Anne\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Judge Irwin\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Tiny Duffy\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Sadie Burke\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Adam Stanton\n** Montgomery John as young Adam \n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Rachel Burden\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Roderick \"Sugar Boy\" Ellis\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Lucy Stark\n* Travis Champagne as Tom Stark\n* [[Frederic Forrest]] as Donald Stark\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Alex Fauntleroy\n* [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]] as Mr. Henley \n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Commissioner Sherman \n* [[Jay Patterson]] as Senator Kruczemark \n* [[Michael Cavanaugh (actor)|Michael Cavanaugh]] as Mr. Payton\n* [[Caroline Lagerfelt]] as Mrs. Payton\n* [[Eileen Ryan]] as Lily Littlepaugh\n* [[Gary Grubbs]] as Sheriff Boyle\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[New Orleans]], [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]], [[Donaldsonville]], at the [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in [[Baton Rouge]] and many other places in [[Louisiana]].\n\nThe film garnered strong [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] \"buzz\" and was considered a contender by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' even before its initial opening.<ref name=\"tomatoes\"/><ref>[https://ew.com/article/2006/05/12/what-happened-remake-all-kings-men/ What happened to the remake of \"All the King's Men\"?|EW.com]</ref>\n\nThe world premiere was held at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/home/default.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217091011/http://archives.torontointernationalfilmfestival.ca/home/default.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-17 |title=2006 TIFF Archive }}</ref> on September 11, 2006, where the film was first screened to the press.
