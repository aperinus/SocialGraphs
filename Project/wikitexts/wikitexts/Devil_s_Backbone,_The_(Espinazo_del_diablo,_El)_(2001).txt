It was released to positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nCasares, a doctor, and his friend's wife Carmen operate a small orphanage in a remote part of Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Helping the couple are Jacinto, the groundskeeper, and his fianc\u00e9e Conchita, a teacher. Casares and Carmen support the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican loyalists]], and are hiding a large cache of gold being used to back the Republican treasury; the orphanage has also been subject to attacks from [[Francisco Franco]]'s troops, and an inert bomb sits in the courtyard.\n\nOne day, an orphan named Carlos arrives with Ayala and Dom\u00ednguez, two loyalists. Casares and Carmen take Carlos in, and he soon strikes up a friendship with Jaime, the orphanage bully, as well as Galvez and Owl. However, Carlos soon begins having visions of a mysterious entity, and hears stories about a child named Santi who went missing on the day the bomb was dropped in the courtyard. On his first night at the orphanage, Carlos is dared by Jaime to sneak to the kitchen for water after curfew. The boys reach the kitchen, but Jaime sneaks back to the dormitory, leaving Carlos alone. Carlos hears a whisper telling him that \"many of you will die.\" Frightened, Carlos rushes outside, but is caught by Jacinto. The next morning, Casares asks who snuck out after curfew but Carlos claims he went alone. This, as well as Carlos saving Jaime from falling in a [[cistern]], earns him Jaime's friendship.\n\nJacinto knows of the gold hidden at the orphanage, and uses his affair with Carmen as an opportunity to take her keys and search for the treasure. That night, the boys hear strange noises and Carlos decides to investigate. He sneaks out, and encounters a pale figure of a young boy with a bleeding wound on his head, which causes him to run back into the building. Later, after flipping through Jaime's sketchbook, Carlos finds a drawing of a ghostly figure labeled \"Santi,\" leading him to suspect that Jaime knows more than the other boys.\n\nCasares sees that Ayala has been captured by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalists]]. Fearing Ayala will soon be tortured into revealing the gold\u2019s location at the orphanage, he convinces Carmen that they must evacuate the children immediately. Jacinto overhears the conversation and confronts Carmen, demanding the stash of gold and crassly bringing up their affair in front of Casares. Enraged, Casares points a gun at Jacinto and forces him to leave.\n\nAs the orphans and faculty prepare to leave, Conchita discovers Jacinto pouring gasoline around the kitchen. She shoots him in the arm after he mocks her, causing a furious Jacinto to start a fire before fleeing the building. Carmen and fellow teacher Alma attempt to put out the fire, but fail to prevent an explosion; Alma is killed by the blast, as are several of the children. Casares finds a mortally wounded Carmen inside the building, and tearfully stays with her as she dies. Casares decides to remain in the charred orphanage with the surviving children, arming himself for Jacinto's return.\n\nThe following night, Jaime reveals to Carlos the details of Santi's disappearance: Jaime and Santi had been collecting slugs at the cistern, when they spotted Jacinto attempting to open the safe where the gold was kept. Jaime managed to escape, but Jacinto cornered Santi and attempted to threaten him into keeping silent. In anger, Jacinto shoved Santi against a stone wall, giving him a severe head injury and sending him into shock. A panicked Jacinto then tied stones to Santi before sinking his body in the cistern. A terrified Jaime then ran into the courtyard, only to have the bomb land several feet from him moments later.\n\nJaime insists that he is no longer scared of Jacinto, and will kill him if he returns. Conchita attempts to walk to the nearest town for help when she encounters Jacinto and two associates driving back to the orphanage to claim the gold. Jacinto threatens her with a knife, telling her to apologize for shooting him, but she insults him instead, and he stabs her to death.\n\nCarlos has a final encounter with Santi's ghost, who he is no longer afraid of after hearing the circumstances of his death. The ghost quietly demands that Carlos bring Jacinto to him.\n\nCasares dies of his injuries as Jacinto and his associates reach the orphanage and imprison the orphans while they search for the gold. The two other men eventually grow impatient and leave, but Jacinto finds and takes the stash. Meanwhile, Jaime encourages the children to fight back. They fashion weapons from sharpened sticks and broken glass and attack Jacinto in the cellar, finally pushing him into the cistern where he had dumped Santi's body. Weighed down by the gold he was carrying, Jacinto struggles to resurface, but Santi's ghost appears from the depths and drags him to his death.\n\nAs the remaining children leave the orphanage and head to town, Casares' ghost watches them from the doorway.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernando Tielve]] as Carlos, an orphan. He is described by del Toro in the DVD commentary as a force of [[innocence]]. Tielve had originally auditioned as an extra before [[Guillermo del Toro|del Toro]] decided to cast him as the lead. This was his film debut.
