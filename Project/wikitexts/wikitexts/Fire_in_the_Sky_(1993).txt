It is based on [[Travis Walton UFO incident|Travis Walton's]] book ''The Walton Experience'',<ref>{{cite book|title=The Walton Experience|first=Travis|last=Walton|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|location=[[Boston]]|year=1997|orig-year=1978|edition=3rd|isbn=978-1569247105}}</ref> which describes an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] abduction. The film stars [[D. B. Sweeney]] as Walton, and [[Robert Patrick]] as his best friend and future brother-in-law, Mike Rogers. [[James Garner]], [[Craig Sheffer]], [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]], [[Henry Thomas]] and [[Peter Berg]] also star.\n\n''Fire in the Sky'' grossed $19.9 million domestically on a $15 million budget and received mixed reviews. It was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn November 5, 1975 in [[Snowflake, Arizona]], [[lumberjack|logger]] [[Travis Walton UFO incident|Travis Walton]], and his co-workers \u2014 Mike Rogers, Allan Dallis, David Whitlock, Greg Hayes and Bobby Cogdill \u2014 head to work in the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]].\n\nDriving home from work, the loggers come across an [[unidentified flying object]]. Curious, Walton gets out of the truck and is struck by a bright beam of light from the object and is sent flying several feet backwards as if pushed by an unseen force. Fearing Walton has been killed, the others escape from the scene. Rogers decides to go back to the spot to retrieve Walton, but he is nowhere to be found. Making their way back to town to report the incident, the loggers are met with skepticism by investigators Sheriff Blake Davis and Lieutenant Frank Watters. Watters, realizing that there was a great deal of tension between Dallis and Walton and that Dallis has a criminal record, suspects [[wikt:foul play|foul play]], a belief that quickly spreads to the rest of the town, leaving the loggers as social pariahs.\n\nAfter a large search party turns up no sign of Travis, the loggers are offered the chance to take a [[polygraph|lie detector]] test. Though Dallis is initially hesitant, the loggers ultimately take the test in the hopes of proving their innocence. However, Watters declares that the tests were inconclusive and that they will have to return the next day to retake it. Rogers is outraged and he angrily declines, the other loggers following suit. The test's administrator reveals to Watters and Davis that, with the exception of Dallis (whose test results were inconclusive), the loggers seem to be telling the truth.\n\n[[File:Travis Walton 2019.jpg|alt=Travis Walton at the 2019 International UFO Congress.|left|thumb|Travis Walton at the 2019 International UFO Congress.]]\nFive days later, Rogers receives a call from someone claiming to be Walton. He is found at a [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]] gas station, alive but naked, [[dehydration|dehydrated]] and incoherent. A [[ufology|ufologist]] questions Walton but he is thrown out and Walton is taken to a hospital. Rogers visits Walton while in the emergency room and ends up telling Walton that he left him after he was struck by the light but came back to get him. Walton appears enraged by this and turns away from Rogers who blames the whole incident on Walton for getting out of the truck. During a welcome home party, Walton suffers from a mental breakdown and [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of the abduction by the extraterrestrials.\n\nIn his flashback, he awakens inside a slimy cocoon. Breaking out of its membrane, he finds himself in a zero-gravity environment inside a cylindrical enclosure whose walls contain other similar cocoons and he is horrified to inadvertently discover that one contains the decomposing remains of a human body. As he makes his way to a neighboring area featuring what appear to be several humanoid space suits, he is apprehended by two extraterrestrial creatures. He is unwillingly hauled down corridors full of terrestrial detritus such as shoes and keys before arriving in a bizarre examination room. The aliens strip him of his clothes and cover him with an elastic material that pins him to a raised platform under an array of equipment and lights in the middle of the room. Despite Walton's terrified screams, the aliens pitilessly subject him to an experiment in which a gelatinous substance is shoved into his mouth, his jaw is clamped open, a device is inserted into his neck and he is forced to endure an ocular probe while fully conscious during the experience. Afterwards, Walton loses consciousness until finding himself back on [[Earth]] disoriented and severely traumatized.\n \nWhile interviewing Walton, Lieutenant Watters expresses his doubts about the abduction, dismissing it as merely a hoax. He notes Walton's newfound celebrity because of the tabloids' attempts to profit from his tale, believing that he had faked the abduction to become a celebrity. However, with the investigation closed, Watters is forced to abandon his pursuit and leaves town. Two and a half years later, Walton visits Rogers, now a recluse, and the two reconcile. The closing titles inform that in 1993, Walton, Rogers, and Dallis were resubmitted to additional polygraph examinations, which they passed, corroborating their innocence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[D.

In the book, Walton tells of how he was abducted by a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]. Walton's original book was later re-released as ''Fire in the Sky'' ({{ISBN|1-56924-710-2}}) to promote the book's connection to the film. The real Travis Walton and his wife, Dana Walton, have a brief cameo in the film.\n\nThe film's alien abduction scenes bear almost no resemblance to Walton's actual claims. Scriptwriter [[Tracy Torm\u00e9]] reported that executives found Walton's account boring, and insisted on the changes.<ref>[[Jerome Clark|Clark, Jerome]]. ''The UFO Book'', Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 1998.</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}} Director [[Robert Lieberman]] suspected Travis Walton's account was a hoax, saying: \"My gut feeling had it that Travis was so much smarter than those other guys, that it started out as a gag. They probably laced their beer at the end of the day with a little acid or something and then they put on a show for these guys and they believed it.\"<ref name=\"Falk\">{{Cite web |last=Falk |first=Ben |date=2022-07-29 |title=Fire in the Sky {{!}} How We Made the 1993 Alien Abduction Thriller |url=https://www.thecompanion.app/2022/07/29/fire-in-the-sky-x-files/ |access-date=2022-07-31 |website=The Companion |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nCast members [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]], who played Dan Walton, and [[Robert Patrick]], who played Mike Rogers, spent time with their counterparts. Patrick, who felt typecast in villainous roles following [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]], gained weight and grew a beard for the audition.<ref name=\"Falk\"/> He later found out that he was related to his character: \"Lo and behold, when I contacted the Mormons in my family, I found out through marriage, I am related to Mike Rogers. And I was like, \u2018I am?!\u2019 I called him, we spoke, I asked him specifically about how he was feeling during all this. I wanted to know his emotions. And he said to me during the abduction and the subsequent conversations afterward, that he could not control his emotion. And I tried to utilize that during the film.\"<ref name=\"Falk\"/>\n\nThe [[special effects]] in the film were coordinated by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], and the [[cinematography]] was handled by [[Bill Pope]]. The original music score was composed and arranged by [[Mark Isham]]. The audio soundtrack was released in [[compact disc]] format on March 30, 1993 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]. An expanded limited edition CD set of the soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records on March 11, 2022, followed by a cassette release by Terror Vision Records on August 19.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://lalalandrecords.com/fire-in-the-sky-limited-edition/|title= FIRE IN THE SKY: LIMITED EDITION|access-date= October 25, 2022|work= La-La Land Records}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.terror-vision.com/store/fire-in-the-sky-1993-ost-cassette|title= Fire in the Sky (1993) OST Cassette|access-date= October 25, 2022|work= Terror Vision Records}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Fire in the Sky'' met with generally favorable reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/fire-in-the-sky-still-a-frightening-flick-at-25|title=Fire In The Sky still a frightening flick at 25|last=Spry|first=Jeff|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Syfy]]|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> John Ferguson of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' wrote, \"Lieberman wisely concentrates on the emotional impact of the event on a close-knit circle of friends and family, although the eventual revelation of the abduction is genuinely scary.
