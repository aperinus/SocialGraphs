The film stars [[Stephen Dorff]], [[Brad Renfro]], [[James Franco]], [[Matt Dillon]], and [[Fairuza Balk]].\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] was originally the executive producer (as a favor to Paul Kimatian), but he eventually removed his name from this film. It was the final film of [[cinematographer]] [[John A. Alonzo]] before his death in 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nLeon and Bobby Anthony are brothers and members of the Deuces, a Brooklyn street gang who protect their neighborhood of Sunset Park. Ever since the death of their youngest brother Alphonse \"Allie Boy\" from a drug overdose at the hands of Marco, the leader of the Vipers, a neighboring rival street gang, they fiercely keep drugs off their turf. This puts them in strong opposition to the Vipers, who want to continue to sell drugs in the neighborhood. On the eve of Marco's return from a three-year stint in prison, a gang war seems imminent, as the Deuces violently retaliate with suspicion against Vipers muscleman and bookie Philly, who ekes out a vacant nightclub to establish business down the block. Marco, along with hoping to re-establish his drug pushing enterprise, plans revenge against Leon, whom he believes ratted him out to the police for selling the killing \"hot shot\" to Alphonse.\n\nBobby falls for a new girl who moves in across the street, Annie, the uninvolved younger sister of Jimmy \"Pockets\", a Vipers member and heroin dealer, who takes care of their elderly dementia ailing mother. Their attraction for each other complicates the gang rivalry, especially with Leon, who mistakenly fears, feels Annie may be using Bobby. After jumping Deuces member Jackie in kind for the earlier attack, causing more gang fights in the neighborhood, Marco begins his activities again and allows the Vipers to rampage and terrorize residents across the block to establish his return for good. Later, Marco and the Vipers intimidate Bobby while on a date at the beach with Annie, before beating and raping Betsy (Leon's girlfriend) to push him over the edge.\n\nAfter Leon runs a car through the Viper's main hangout, neighborhood Mafioso Fritzy orders Leon and Marco to make amends; unopposed to Marco's drug dealing, knowing he can profit off of his racket and without appeal to Leon's cause to keep the neighborhood safe, Leon and Marco agree to a gang war, much to Fritzy's disappointment. Annie defends her mother from another one of Jimmy's outbursts with a kitchen knife and having enough of their troubled life in Brooklyn, wishes to run away with Bobby and her mother. As the Deuces and the Vipers meet at the docks for their confrontation, battle ensues. Marco is killed by Leon in a duel, being saved by tag-along kid Scooch, while Jimmy Pockets is shot and killed by Philly, who accuses him of stealing the gang's stash of money. Leon is shot and killed by one of Fritzy's men in retaliation for ignoring his orders.\n\nAt Leon's funeral, Bobby and the gang, along with his and Annie's mother, pay their last respects to Leon. In a small epilogue, Bobby explains that his mother will go to live with their uncle in Long Island, he and Annie are free to take her mother to Los Angeles to start anew, gives Scooch and Father Aldo of the nearby Catholic church part of the stolen stash of money to invest and that after the funeral, this would be the last time he would see the Deuces again, as gangs throughout Brooklyn would eventually disappear. Before leaving, Bobby drops a wheelbarrow full of cinder blocks on Fritzy's car, presumably killing him, to uphold Leon's word that \"there would be no more junk on the streets\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Leon Anthony\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as Bobby Anthony\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Annie \"The Ice Cube\" Pockets\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Father Aldo\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as \"Scooch\"\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Jimmy \"Pockets\"\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as \"Fritzy\"\n* [[Norman Reedus]] as Marco Vendetti\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Freddie\n* [[Drea de Matteo]] as Betsy\n* [[Louis Lombardi]] as Philly \"Babe\"\n* [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] as Wendy\n* [[James Franco]] as Tino Verona\n* [[Joshua Leonard|Josh Leonard]] as \"Punchy\"\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Vinnie \"Fish\"\n* George Georgiadis as Willie\n* [[Jackie Tohn]] as Mary Ann\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews and currently holds a 3% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deuces_wild/ |title=Deuces Wild |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend the film grossed $1,020,000 million in 1,480 theaters in the United States and Canada, debuting number 6 of box office.
