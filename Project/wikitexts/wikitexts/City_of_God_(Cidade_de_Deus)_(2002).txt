Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani adapted the story from the [[City of God (Lins novel)|1997 novel of the same name]] written by [[Paulo Lins]], but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of [[organized crime]] in the [[Cidade de Deus (Rio de Janeiro)|Cidade de Deus]] suburb of [[Rio de Janeiro]], between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the film's closure depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l Z\u00e9 and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. The tagline is \"If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you.\"\n\nThe cast includes [[Alexandre Rodrigues (actor)|Alexandre Rodrigues]], [[Leandro Firmino da Hora]], [[Phellipe Haagensen]], [[Douglas Silva]], [[Alice Braga]], and [[Seu Jorge]]. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of [[favela]]s such as [[Vidigal (favela)|Vidigal]] and the Cidade de Deus itself.\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] in 2004: [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[C\u00e9sar Charlone (cinematographer)|C\u00e9sar Charlone]]), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Meirelles), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (Daniel Rezende), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)]] (Mantovani). In 2003, it was Brazil's entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], but it did not end up being nominated as one of the five finalists. It is frequently listed by many critics and audiences as one of the greatest films of the 21st century and [[List of films considered the best|one of the best films of all time]].\n\nMeirelles and Lund went on to create the ''[[City of Men]]'' TV series and film ''[[City of Men (film)|City of Men]]'' (2007), which share some of the actors (notably leads Silva and [[Darlan Cunha]]) and their setting with ''City of God''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins ''[[in medias res]]'' with an armed gang chasing after an escaped chicken in a ''[[favela]]'' called the ''Cidade de Deus'' (\"City of God\"). The chicken stops between the gang and the narrator, a young man nicknamed Rocket (\"Buscap\u00e9\").\n\nThe film flashes back to the 1960s where the favela is shown as a newly built housing project with few resources. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \"Tender Trio\" \u2013 Shaggy (\"Cabeleira\"), Clipper (\"Alicate\"), and Rocket's older brother, Goose (\"Marreco\") \u2013 rob business owners and share the money with the community who, in turn, hide them from the police. \n\nLi'l Dice (Dadinho), a young boy, convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as a lookout. Instead, Li'l Dice guns down the motel occupants after falsely warning the trio that the police are coming. The massacre attracts so much police attention that the trio is forced to split up: Clipper joins the Church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the ''favela'', and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking his money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (Ben\u00e9), Shaggy's brother, watches.\n\nIn the 1970s, the favela has been transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young [[hippie]]s. He enjoys [[photography]] and likes one girl, Ang\u00e9lica, but his attempt to get close to her is ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as \"The Runts\". Li'l Dice, who now calls himself \"Li'l Z\u00e9\" (\"Z\u00e9 Pequeno\"), has established a drug empire with Benny by eliminating all of the competition, except for Carrot, who is a good friend of Benny's.\n\nLi'l Z\u00e9 takes over 'the apartment', a known drug distribution center, and forces Carrot's manager Blacky (\"Neguinho\"), to work for him instead. Coincidentally, Rocket visits the apartment to get some drugs off Blacky for Ang\u00e9lica during the apartment raid. Through narration, Rocket momentarily considers attempting to kill Li'l Z\u00e9 to avenge his brother but decides against it. He is let go after Benny tells Li'l Z\u00e9 that Rocket is Goose's brother.\n\nLater, a relative peace comes over the City of God under the reign of Li'l Z\u00e9, who manages to avoid police attention. Benny decides to branch out of the drug dealer crowd and befriends Tiago, Ang\u00e9lica's ex-boyfriend, who introduces him to his (and Rocket's) friend group. Benny and Ang\u00e9lica begin dating. Together, they decide to leave the City and the drug trade.\n\nDuring Benny's farewell party, Z\u00e9 and Benny get into an argument. Blacky accidentally kills Benny while trying to shoot Li'l Z\u00e9. Benny's death leaves Li'l Z\u00e9 unchecked. Carrot kills Blacky for endangering his life. Li'l Z\u00e9 and a group of his soldiers start to make their way to Carrot's hideout to kill him.\n\nOn the way, Z\u00e9 follows a girl who dismissed his advances at Benny's party. He beats up her boyfriend, a peaceful man named Knockout Ned (Man\u00e9 Galinha), and rapes her. After Ned's brother stabs Li'l Z\u00e9, his gang retaliates by shooting into his house, killing his brother and uncle in the process. A gang war breaks out between Carrot and Li'l Z\u00e9. A vengeful Ned sides with Carrot.\n\nThe war is still ongoing a year later, in 1981, the origin forgotten. Both sides enlist more \"soldiers\" and Li'l Z\u00e9 gives the Runts weapons. One day, Li'l Z\u00e9 has Rocket take photos of him and his gang. A reporter publishes the photos, a significant scoop since no outsiders can safely enter the City of God anymore. Rocket believes his life is endangered, as he thinks Li'l Z\u00e9 will kill him for publishing the photo of him and his gang. The reporter takes Rocket in for the night, and he loses his virginity to her. Unbeknownst to him, Li'l Z\u00e9, jealous of Ned's media fame, is pleased with the photos and with his own increased notoriety.\n\nRocket returns to the City for more photographs, bringing the film back to its opening scene. Rocket finds himself caught between Z\u00e9's gang and the arriving police, who quickly withdraw when they realize they are outnumbered and outgunned. Rocket is surprised that Z\u00e9 asks him to take pictures, but as he prepares to take the photo, Carrot's gang arrives. In the ensuing gunfight, Ned is killed by a boy \u2013 revealed as the same one who wounded him earlier \u2013 who has infiltrated his gang to avenge his father, a policeman whom Ned has shot. The police capture Li'l Z\u00e9 and Carrot and plan to show Carrot off to the media. Since Li'l Z\u00e9 has been bribing the police, they take all of Li'l Z\u00e9's money and let him go, but Rocket secretly photographs the scene. The Runts murder Z\u00e9 to avenge the Runt murdered at the behest of Z\u00e9; they intend to run his criminal enterprise themselves.\n\nRocket contemplates whether to publish the cops' photo, expose corruption, and become famous, or the picture of Li'l Z\u00e9's dead body, which will get him an internship at the newspaper. He decides on the latter, fearing a violent response from the cops, as well as seeing the opportunity to pursue his dream. The film ends with the Runts walking around the City of God, making a hit list of the dealers they plan to kill to take over the drug business, including the ''[[Comando Vermelho|Red Brigade]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandre Rodrigues (actor)|Alexandre Rodrigues]] as Rocket:<br / >The narrator, who dreams of becoming a photographer.

According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: \"Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil, there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity.\"<ref name=\"Bessa/iG\">{{cite web|last=Bessa|first=Priscila|date=4 June 2012|title=Dez anos depois, diretor de Cidade de Deus diz ter preju\u00edzo de R$4 milh\u00f5es|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/cultura/cinema/2012-06-04/dez-anos-depois-diretor-de-cidade-de-deus-diz-ter-prejuizo-de-r.html|url-status=live|access-date=9 December 2012|work=\u00daltimo Segundo|publisher=[[Internet Group]]|archive-date=7 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607210447/http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/cultura/cinema/2012-06-04/dez-anos-depois-diretor-de-cidade-de-deus-diz-ter-prejuizo-de-r.html}}</ref>\n\nBeginning around 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an \"actors' workshop\" for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theatre and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, scuffle, and shoot-out. A lot came from [[improvisation]], as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally. After filming, the crew could not leave the cast to return to their old lives in the favelas. Help groups were set up to help those involved in the production to build more promising futures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Vieira|first=Else Ribeiro Pires|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62368025|title=City of God in Several Voices: Brazilian Social Cinema as Action|date=2005|publisher=Critical, Cultural and Communication Press|others=Else Ribeiro Pires Vieira|isbn=1-905510-00-4|location=Nottingham, England|oclc=62368025}}</ref>{{rp|135\u2013139}}\n\nMeirelles went into the film with the intention of staying true to the \"casual nature\" of the violence in [[City of God (Lins novel)|the novel by Lins]]. Critic Jean Oppenheimer wrote on the production of the film saying that: \"A second guiding principle was to avoid glamorising the violence\" and that \"many of the killings are either shown indistinctly or kept out of frame.\"<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|26\u201332}}\n\nBecause the real Cidade de Deus favela was in conflict, a large majority of the film was shot in Cidade Alta, a different favela within Rio.
