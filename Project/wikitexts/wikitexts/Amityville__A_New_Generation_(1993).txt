It is the [[The Amityville Horror (franchise)|seventh film based on ''The Amityville Horror'']].\n\n== Plot ==\nBefore the [[Ronald DeFeo Jr.|DeFeos]] moved into 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, the Bronners occupied the house. In 1966, the Bronner family's eldest son, Franklin, killed his parents and two siblings during [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. Bronner, who had a long history of mental illness, claimed to have committed the familicide at the behest of otherworldly forces within the house and was committed to Danamore State Hospital. Years later, his wife and their young son, Keyes Terry, visited Bronner. Despite being sedated, Bronner killed his wife in front of Keyes. Keyes repressed the memory of visiting Danamore and never received any notification about his father being discharged from it in 1986.\n\nIn 1993, Keyes, now a photographer, lives in an inner-city [[boarding house]] with his girlfriend, Llanie. Dick Cutler owns the boarding house, and its other tenants include a painter named Suki and a sculptor named Pauli. Bronner tracks down Keyes and gives him a mirror that he took from the house in Amityville. The mirror is demonic, and it kills Suki and her ex-boyfriend, Raymond. After Bronner is found dead, Keyes begins looking into his past and realizes that Bronner was his father after visiting Danamore.\n\nThe demon in the mirror assumes Suki's form to kill Dick and afterward begins tormenting Keyes by turning into Bronner. Keyes gets sucked into the mirror, which brings him to a Hellish version of Danamore, where he encounters undead versions of Raymond, Suki, Dick, and Bronner. The demon then returns Keyes to the real world and makes it clear that it wants Keyes to reenact the massacre of the Bronner family by shooting Llanie, Pauli, and Dick's wife at the boarding house's Thanksgiving art show. Keyes resists the demon's influence and breaks the mirror, prompting the assigned Detective Clark to sardonically quip, \"Seven years bad luck.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ross Partridge]] as Keyes Terry\n* [[Julia Nickson-Soul]] as Suki\n* [[Lala Sloatman]] as Llanie (credited as Lala)\n* [[David Naughton]] as Dick Cutler\n* [[Barbara Howard (actress)|Barbara Howard]] as Janet Cutler\n* Jack Orend as Franklin Bronner (as Jack R.
