Instead of waiting for her controlling and unfaithful husband, she hitchhikes her way home, only to impulsively detour to [[Venice]]. In the lagoon city, the woman, who soon runs out of money, finds accommodations with a restaurant [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]], Fernando Girasole, an elderly man from Iceland who speaks a refined and literary Italian. Rosalba finds herself enjoying her new life: she strikes up an affectionate friendship with the holistic masseuse Grazia, Fernando's neighbour, and finds a job at a small flower shop run by Fermo, an elderly and ill-tempered anarchist who is won over by the woman's polite ways.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband sent Costantino, a bumbling plumber who has come for the interview to his company, as a private detective to find her. Rosalba is increasingly attracted by the delicate, romantic and mysterious personality of the discreet waiter, and a relationship of small daily gestures develops between them. On the other hand, during his search Costantino meets Grazia and instantly falls in love with her. He calls Rosalba's husband and quits his detective job, claiming that he no longer intends to look for his wife.\n\nHowever, Rosalba is eventually joined by her husband's lover, a family friend, who induces her to return home, making her believe that her son has taken to drugs during her absence. She abandons her Venice life to return to her parental duties and daily routine, finding that nothing has changed at all and her son is not really in danger.\n\nLeft in Venice all by himself, Fernando borrows Fermo's van to undertake a journey to Pescara, where he finally declares his love to Rosalba. The woman thus returns to Venice for good with her youngest son.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Licia Maglietta]] as Rosalba Barletta\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Fernando Girasole\n* [[Giuseppe Battiston]] as Costantino Caponangeli\n* [[Antonio Catania]] as Mimmo Barletta, Rosalba's husband\n* [[Marina Massironi]] as Grazia Reginella\n* [[Felice Andreasi]] as Fermo\n* Vitalba Andrea as Ketty, Mimmo's lover\n* Ludovico Paladin as Eliseo Girasole, Fernando's nephew\n* Tatiana Lepore as Adele, Eliseo's mother\n* [[Silvana Bosi]] as Costantino's mother\n* Tiziano Cucchiarelli as Nicola Barletta (\"Nic\")\n* [[Don Backy]] as the singer in the dance hall\n* Daniela Piperno as the woman giving a lift to Rosalba\n* Fausto Russo Alesi as the man giving a lift to Rosalba\n\n== Music ==\n* \"Moro\" by [[Lars Hollmer]]\n* \"Franska Valsen\" by [[Lars Hollmer]]\n* Theme from \"La Gazza Ladra\" by [[Gioachino Rossini]]\n* \"Il Valzer di Vera Zasulich\" by Giovanni Venosta\n* \"Disco Man\" by [[Ranee Lee]], [[Alain Leroux]], [[Jacques Lafleche]], sung by Ranee Lee\n* \"Eclisse Twist\" by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], performed by [[Tuscolano Brothers]]\n* \"Frasi d'amori\" by [[Aldo Caponi]] and [[Detto Mariano]], sung by [[Don Backy]]\n* \"Tu Solamente Tu\" (1939) by [[Pasquale Frustaci]] and [[Michele Galdieri]], sung by [[Tiola Silenzi]]\n* \"Rosa y Clavel\" by B.
