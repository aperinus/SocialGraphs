Its score was composed by [[Joe Hisaishi]]. The film was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/kikujiro|title=Festival de Cannes: Kikujiro|work=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=2021-03-10}}</ref>\n\n''Kikujiro'' tells the story of a young boy searching for his mother during his summer vacation. The film is mostly divided into smaller chapters, listed as entries in the boy's summer vacation diary. Kitano's inspiration for the character (not the film) was his own father, Kikujiro Kitano, a [[gambler]] who struggled to feed his family and pay the rent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What I Did Last Summer: Close-Up on Takeshi Kitano\u2019s \"Kikujiro\"|url=https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/what-i-did-last-summer-close-up-on-takeshi-kitano-s-kikujiro|access-date=2021-08-24|website=MUBI|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to his earlier works ''[[Getting Any?]]'' and ''[[A Scene at the Sea]]'', Kitano references the [[yakuza]] only tangentially in ''Kikujiro'', a departure from his work in crime dramas such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' and ''[[Hana-bi]]''. Aimed at the whole family, the film was allegedly inspired by ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with the basic premise being a road trip. Kitano's familiar elements and locales are present: drawings, vignettes, the seaside, and [[angel]]s. Although the plot is composed largely of sad events, the film often has a light-hearted atmosphere, achieved mostly through Kitano's character and his somewhat bizarre encounters.\n\n==Plot==\nMasao, who lives alone with his grandmother in an old [[Shitamachi]] area of [[Tokyo]], receives a package, and in looking for a seal finds a photo of his long lost mother. He finds her address in [[Toyohashi]], several hundred miles to the west. Leaving home to see his mother, he meets his grandmother's neighbors, Kikujiro and his wife. Kikujiro's wife forces Kikujiro to accompany Masao on a journey to see his mother, telling Masao's grandmother that they are going to the beach.\n\nAt the start of their journey, Kikujiro is not serious about reaching Toyohashi. He gets absorbed in [[track cycling]] races and gambles away their winnings. Later, left outside a [[yakitori]] restaurant, Masao encounters a molester. After a narrow escape, Kikujiro promises to keep to the journey and take Masao to his mother.\nWhen the [[Taxicab|taxi]] Kikujiro steals breaks down, they are forced to [[hitchhike]] to Toyohashi, meeting various people along the way. They get lifts from a [[juggler]] and her boyfriend on a date, and a travelling poet who delivers them to [[Toyohashi]]. When they finally reach the address of Masao's mother, Kikujiro finds her living as a [[housewife]] with another man and their daughter. Masao's mother lives a completely different life from what he expected. It is almost as if she has forgotten him. Kikujiro tells Masao that she has just moved away, pretending not to have seen her. He tries to comfort Masao with a small blue bell shaped like an [[angel]] bullied from two bikers whom he happens to come across.\n\nMasao is so disappointed that Kikujiro cannot help but try to brighten up their return trip to Tokyo. He tells him an angel will come at the sound of the bell.\n\nThey visit a summer [[matsuri]] held in a local [[Shinto shrine]]. While Kikujiro gets into trouble with some yakuza over a fixed shooting game, Masao dreams of dancing ''[[tengu]]''.\n\nBack on the road, they meet the poet and the two bikers again. They decide to camp a few days together. Masao enjoys playing some traditional games with them.\n\nKikujiro is reminded of his own mother (it is implied that she, like Masao's mother, also left him as a child). Kikujiro gets one of the bikers to take him from their camp to his mother's [[nursing home]] in [[Daito, Shizuoka|Daito-cho]], a small country town,  but he eventually decides not to see her and returns to the camp.\n\nThe men continue to do their best to entertain Masao by larking about for a few more days. Before they are to return to [[Tokyo]], Masao dreams about them appearing over the [[Milky Way]]. In the morning, the bikers say goodbye to them and leave the camp. Masao and Kikujiro get a lift in the poet's car to Tokyo. After dropping them off at a bridge, the poet continues on his way to [[Osaka]] and [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]].\n\nBefore Masao and Kikujiro part, Kikujiro says, \"Let's do it again sometime,\" and Masao thanks him. Kikujiro tells Masao to take care of his grandmother. Masao asks Kikujiro's name and Kikujiro answers, \"Kikujiro! Now scram!\"  Masao passes a small bridge with the angel bell ringing.\n\n==Themes==\nThe film explores alienation and inclusion in Japanese society. The main characters, and those who help them along the way, are all considered outcasts from accepted social norms, not being part of a traditional family or group structure. Characters who maintain a more accepted lifestyle are frequently at odds with the protagonists.\n\nEarly in the film, the protagonists react to their alienation with anger (Kikujiro) and sadness (Masao). Along their journey, they start to discover how alike they are and the events in Toyohashi act as a turning point from which the characters begin to find comfort in their shared isolation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takeshi Kitano|Beat Takeshi]] as Kikujiro Takeda \n* [[Kayoko Kishimoto]] as Kikujiro's Wife \n* [[Yusuke Sekiguchi]] as Masao Sugiyama\n* [[Y\u016bko Daike]] as Satoko Sugiyama \n* [[Kazuko Yoshiyuki]] as Masao's Grandmother \n* [[Beat Kiyoshi]] as Man at the bus stop \n* [[Great Gidayu]] as Biker\n* [[Rakkyo Ide]] as Biker's Friend\n* [[Nezumi Imamura]] as Travelling Man \n* [[Fumie Hosokawa]] as Juggler \n* [[Akaji Maro]] as Scary Man \n* [[Daigaku Sekine]] as [[Yakuza]] Boss\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n|name       = Kikujiro's Summer\n|type       = soundtrack\n|artist     = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n|cover      = Kikujiro summer - album cover.jpg\n|border     = yes\n|alt        =\n|caption    = <small>Milan Records cover</small>\n|released   = 26 May 1999\n|recorded   =\n|venue      =\n|studio     =\n|genre      = Stage & screen\n|length     =\n|label      = [[Milan Records]] <small>73138 35911-2</small><br /> [[Polydor]] <small>POCH 1788</small>\n|producer   = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n|prev_title =\n|prev_year  =\n|next_title =\n|next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe album includes \"Summer\", one of the most famous compositions by Hisaishi; it was also re-arranged and used for [[Toyota Corolla]] commercials, for instance.
