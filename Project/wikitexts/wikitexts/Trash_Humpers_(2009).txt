They interact with a young boy, both mocking him for failing to shoot baskets and encouraging his own violent and disturbing tendencies. The characters participate in a variety of depraved and unpleasant activities, like making two men (wearing hospital gowns and adjoining hats) eat pancakes covered in dish soap. All their activities involve elements of peer pressure or ritualistic antics. There is very little dialogue throughout, and much of it is incoherent. A recurring chant is, \"Make it! Make it! Don't fake it!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rachel Korine]] as Momma\n* Brian Kotzur as Buddy\n* [[Travis Nicholson]] as Travis\n* [[Harmony Korine]] as Herv\u00e9\n\n==Production==\nWalking his dog late at night in the back alleys of his hometown of [[Nashville]], Korine encountered trash bins strewn across the ground in what he imagined as a war zone. Overhead lights beamed down upon the trash in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style that Korine found very dramatic. They began to resemble human form, beaten, abused and \"very humpable.\"<ref name=\"nymag\">Ebiri, Bilge.

Everything needs to be so [[high-definition video|high-definition]]. There was a strange beauty in the [[Analog television|analog]]. You almost have to squint to see things through the grain and the mist. There's something sinister about it.\"<ref name=\"nymag\"/>\n\nUpset over the bureaucracy in producing his previous and still most expensive feature, ''[[Mister Lonely]]'', Korine aimed to make his next film as fast as he could, analogous to the free-form immediacy of painter and canvas.<ref name=\"nymag\"/> As a self-proclaimed \"mistakist artist\", Korine encouraged spontaneity. Like ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'', the script was merely a collection of written down ideas. Before filming, Korine shot [[lo-fi]] images of people in costumes late at night to help find his aesthetic.<ref>[http://www.hammertonail.com/interviews/a-conversation-with-harmony-korine-trash-humpers]/</ref>\n\nFilming lasted only a couple of weeks. \"Once everyone was in their character and their costume, and I had figured out the structure of it, the randomness, the anti-aesthetic, it was really the performers, the Trash Humpers, walking around at night, videotaping each other doing these things,\"<ref name=\"hammer\">Tully, Michael (2009-09-16). \"[http://www.hammertonail.com/dialogues/harmony-korine-trash-humpers-interview/ A Conversation With Harmony Korine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923011111/http://www.hammertonail.com/dialogues/harmony-korine-trash-humpers-interview/ |date=September 23, 2009 }}.\" Hammer to Nail.

We'd get these big tractor tires and make a nest to sleep in.\"<ref name=\"nymag\"/> Korine adds, \"it was pretty intense because there were no breaks. It was just constant.<ref name=\"hammer\"/> Korine says that he didn't think traditionally about scenes, sounds, or color during filming, but more about being true to a feeling. \"If it feels right to me. If there is some strong, palpable, raw quality in the moment then I won't question it.\"<ref name=\"krispy\"/> Korine himself plays as one of the Trash Humpers.\n\nKorine cut the film on two [[VCR]]s to instill an approximate randomness. \"I wanted a kind of incidental awkwardness, like maybe the guy taping it had turned it off and on.\"<ref name=\"nymag\"/> Korine often cites that in creation of the film he aimed to mimic a found object or artifact. He even flirted with the idea of \"leaving the film on a sidewalk somewhere\"<ref name=\"nymag\"/> or place various parts of the film at different flea markets to be unearthed at random and eventually put together as a whole, but ultimately decided he would claim ownership when he realized the copyright could not hold that way.\n\nAt the film's premiere in [[Toronto]], Korine informed the audience that the title was to be taken literally and those likely to walk out were given due warning. In an interview, he state, \"That's why I named it Trash Humpers, because I didn't want to fool anyone.\"<ref name=\"eyeweekly\"/> There were only four months between filming started and the world premiere.<ref name=\"hammer\"/>\n\nFor Korine, ''Trash Humpers'' is an elaborate portrait of the \"American Landscape\": a series of \"park garages, back alleyways, and beautiful lamp posts that light up the gutter.\" Korine has repeatedly emphasized his use of street lamps and how they are for him deeply representative of America.<ref name=\"krispy\"/>\n\nKorine sees the film as an ode to vandalism. \"I have a real deep love and admiration for these characters. Not for what they do, but for the way they do it.\"<ref name=\"nymag\"/> \"There can be a creative beauty in their mayhem and destruction.
