The screenplay focuses on a cheerful and optimistic primary school teacher and her relationships with those around her. The film was well received by critics and resulted in a number of awards for [[Mike Leigh]]'s direction and screenplay, lead actress [[Sally Hawkins]]'s performance, and [[Eddie Marsan]]'s performance in a supporting role.\n\n==Plot==\nThirty years old and single, Pauline \"Poppy\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive.\n\nWhen Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless.\n\nPoppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her pupil, she comes to the correct conclusion that he is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case. Through Tim and the pupil's interactions, the latter reveals that his mother's boyfriend has been beating him. Tim and Poppy begin dating.\n\nPoppy, Zoe, and Poppy's younger sister, Suzy, go to visit another sister, Helen, who lives with her husband in [[Southend-on-Sea]] and is pregnant. Helen proves to be a very judgmental person and tells Poppy she needs to \"take life seriously\", \"not get drunk every night\" and plan for the future. Poppy responds that she is happy with her life as it is. Helen tries to convince Poppy to be more responsible condescendingly telling her she is too childish, but Poppy insists that she is happy and ignores her advice.\n\nReturning home, Poppy sees Scott standing across the street from her flat, and when she calls his name, he runs away. When she confronts him he insists he had been visiting his mother in [[Stevenage]] at the time she saw him. Scott later sees Poppy with her new boyfriend, Tim, and he becomes angry. During Poppy's subsequent driving lesson, Scott drives erratically while ranting about other drivers and society. When he gives Poppy the keys to his car, she tells him he is in no condition to give a driving lesson, and she will drive him home. Scott tries to get his keys back and physically attacks Poppy. She manages to escape his grasp, then in a long, rambling diatribe Scott accuses Poppy of trying to seduce him, revealing his romantic feelings for her. Using patience and understanding to teach him a lesson, Poppy waits until he has calmed down then gives the keys back, telling him this lesson will be their last.\n\nThe film ends with Poppy and Zoe together manoeuvering a rowing boat in [[Regent's Park]], as Zoe advises Poppy she \"can't make everyone happy.\" Poppy cheerfully dismisses the advice, then takes a mobile call from Tim and asks him, \"Missing me already?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Pauline \"Poppy\" Cross\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Scott\n* [[Alexis Zegerman]] as Zoe\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Dawn\n* [[Sinead Matthews]] as Alice\n* [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]] as Heather\n* [[Kate O'Flynn]] as Suzy\n* [[Joseph Kloska]] as Suzy's boyfriend\n* [[Samuel Roukin]] as Tim\n* Caroline Martin as Helen\n* [[Oliver Maltman]] as Jamie\n* [[Nonso Anozie]] as Ezra\n* [[Karina Fernandez]] as Flamenco teacher\n\n==Production==\nThe film is Mike Leigh's first film shot in the 2.35 aspect ratio [[anamorphic format]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/17/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank.mikeleigh1|title=Mike Leigh, part 2|first=Sarfraz|last=Manzoor|date=17 April 2008|access-date=23 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> It was made and distributed with the assistance of [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding through the [[UK Film Council]], with \u00a31.2 million awarded to the production company, and a further \u00a3210,000 awarded to the film's UK distributor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/awards |title=UK Film Council - Awards database |access-date=2009-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423014810/http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/awards |archive-date=23 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }} UK Film Council Awards Database</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Camden Lock]], [[Camden Market]], Regent's Park, [[Stroud Green]], [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], [[Lambeth]], and [[Tufnell Park]] in London and [[Southend-on-Sea]] in Essex.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nIn ''Behind the Wheel of Happy-Go-Lucky'', a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, director Leigh, cinematographer Dick Pope, and stars Sally Hawkins and Eddie Marsan discuss the logistics of filming the lengthy scenes in which Poppy is learning how to drive. Five miniature cameras were hidden throughout the vehicle, and at times Leigh was wedged on the floor behind the front seats. Although the actors were required to adhere to basic plot premises, a large percentage of their dialogue was improvised, forcing them to react to stimuli outside the car and interact in character while concentrating on their driving.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nIn ''Happy-in-Character'', another DVD bonus feature, Leigh and the actors discuss how the director works with his cast one-on-one to help them fully create their characters before actual filming begins. Because Scott is such a troubled individual, Eddie Marsan thought he was preparing for a heavy drama, and it was not until he started working with Sally Hawkins that he realised how funny the film actually was.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Dublin Film Festival]] before going into theatrical release in the UK on 18 April 2008.

The critical consensus states that \"Mike Leigh's latest partially-improvised film is a light-hearted comedy with moments that bite, and features a brilliant star turn by Sally Hawkins.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1195103_happy_go_lucky/|title=Happy-Go-Lucky (2008)|website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[weighted average]] score of 84, based on 34 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/happy-go-lucky|title=Happy-Go-Lucky Reviews|website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' rated the film four out of five stars and said, \"Mike Leigh's trademarked cartoony dialogue, as ever lending a neo-[[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] compression and intensity to the proceedings, is an acquired taste and I have gladly acquired it, though some haven't. I am not quite sure what I think about the big, final confrontation between Poppy and Scott. It is well-acted and composed, and Marsan is ferociously convincing, yet the episode is closed off a little too neatly, and Poppy seems eerily unaffected by this or anything else. The effect is a kind of odd and steely invulnerability: not unattractive exactly, but disconcerting. Hawkins plays it superbly though: exactly right for the part and utterly at ease with a role that is uniquely demanding. In the factory-farmed blandness of the movies, ''Happy-Go-Lucky'' has a strong, real taste.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/18/mikeleigh.drama|title=''Happy-Go-Lucky''|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Bradshaw|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 April 2008|access-date=19 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Philip French]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' called the film \"as funny, serious, life-affirming and beautifully performed as anything Leigh has done, but with a lightness of touch only previously found in his [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] movie, ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/20/culture.mikeleigh|title=Philip French's film of the week: Happy-Go-Lucky|last=French|first=Philip|author-link=Philip French|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=20 April 2008|access-date=19 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Manohla Dargis]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the film \"so closely tuned to the pulse of communal life, to the rhythms of how people work, play and struggle together, it captures the larger picture along with the smaller.

Her bubbly personality may be too much for some. She's like a walking, talking smiley face.

During a lesson, Scott explains to Poppy that \"En-ra-ha\" is a [[fallen angel]] and refers to \"the all-seeing eye\" at the top of a \"golden triangle\" formed by a car's rearview mirror and side mirrors.  Scott tells Poppy, \"You see. You remember. You will remember Enraha till the day you die and I would have done my job.\"  The name \"En-ra-ha\" was invented by Marsan during his improvisational preparation for the film, inspired by a recording of the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Romney|first=Jonathan|title=Nobody's mug: How did Eddie Marsan become Hollywood's go-to man for great British character acting?|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/nobodys-mug-how-did-eddie-marsan-become-hollywoods-goto-man-for-great-british-character-acting-1957176.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220509/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/nobodys-mug-how-did-eddie-marsan-become-hollywoods-goto-man-for-great-british-character-acting-1957176.html |archive-date=9 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Markel|first=J.
