It is about a man named Henry Limpet who turns into a talking fish and helps the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] locate and destroy Nazi submarines. [[Don Knotts]] plays the title character. The live action was directed by [[Arthur Lubin]], while the animation was directed by [[Bill Tytla]], [[Robert McKimson]], [[Hawley Pratt]], and [[Gerry Chiniquy]] at [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. Music includes songs by [[Sammy Fain]], in collaboration with [[Harold Adamson]], including \"I Wish I Were a Fish\", \"Be Careful How You Wish\" and \"Deep Rapture\". The film received mixed reviews. It was the final project for Warner Bros. Cartoons prior to its temporary closure in December 1963.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins in 1963, where George Stickle (a naval officer) and Admiral Harlock discuss how porpoises in the ocean are displaying unique characteristics and suspect that a former top-secret asset, Henry Limpet, may be teaching the creatures these abilities.\n\nThe story flashes back to September 1941 just before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Henry Limpet, a shy bookkeeper, loves fish with a passion and wishes he could be one. His friend George Stickle is a machinist in the [[United States Navy]]. Limpet's wife Bessie is fiercely patriotic and Limpet tries to enlist but he is rejected, classified as [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4F]] because of his poor eyesight and other reasons.\n\nWhile Stickle is on leave, he visits Limpet and Bessie, and they go to [[Coney Island]], where Limpet deliberately falls into the water and turns into a fish for unexplained reasons. Since he never resurfaces nor can he swim, Bessie and George assume he has drowned.\n\nThe fish Limpet, complete with his signature [[pince-nez]] spectacles, discovers a new-found ability during some of his initial misadventures: a powerful underwater roar, his \"[[wiktionary:thrum|thrum]]\". He makes friends with Crusty, a misanthropic [[hermit crab]]. After saving a female fish he names Ladyfish (the concept of names being unknown to her), he falls in love with her despite already being married.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, Limpet directs a Navy convoy to a nearby German [[U-boat]]. Determined to help the Navy on an ongoing basis, Limpet contacts the convoy and requests to see George. With George's help, Limpet gets himself commissioned by the Navy, complete with an advanced rank and a salary, which he sends to Bessie. He helps the Navy locate Nazi U-boats by signaling with his \"thrum\", and plays a large part in the Allied victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. In his final mission, he is nearly killed when the Nazis develop a \"thrum\"-seeking torpedo and is further handicapped by the loss of his spectacles. He manages to survive using Crusty as his \"navigator\", and sinks U-boats by redirecting their torpedoes. After the battle, he swims to Coney Island to say goodbye to Bessie, who gives him a replacement set of glasses. He then swims off with Ladyfish.\n\nIn the film's coda, back in 1963, George and the Admiral travel out to sea to contact Limpet about whether he is training the porpoises.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Henry Limpet\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Bessie Limpet\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Machinist's Mate 2nd Class (PO2) George Stickle\n* [[Andrew Duggan]] as Harlock\n* [[Larry Keating]] as Admiral P.P. Spewter\n* [[Oscar Beregi, Jr.]] as Nazi admiral\n* [[Charles Meredith (actor)|Charles Meredith]] as Fleet Admiral\n* [[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Ladyfish (voice)\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Crusty (voice)\n* [[Phil Arnold]] as Short Fishman (uncredited)\n\nThis was the last film of Larry Keating and Charles Meredith; both died not long after it was finished.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a novel by Theodore Pratt which was published in 1942.<ref>Of Fish and Men: MR. LIMPET. By Theodore Pratt. Drawings by Garrett Price. 144 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $2.\nB S. New York Times 18 Jan 1942: BR19.</ref>\n\nJon Rose and Jonathan Brewer wrote the script, with Rose producing through Warners. Don Knotts signed in March 1962. He planned on making the film on hiatus from ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. It was his first lead role in a film.<ref>Don Knotts to Star in Cinema Fantasy: Comic Will Turn Into Fish and War Hero in 'Mr. Limpet' Hopper, Hedda.

Studios, Burbank|Warner backlot]] later that same month.<ref>Knotts Gets Watered-Down Role\nThomas, Bob. Chicago Daily Tribune 22 July 1962: h16.</ref>\n\nBoth Don Knotts and [[Elizabeth MacRae]] (Limpet and Ladyfish) were employed in [[Andy Griffith]]'s [[Mayberry]] franchises, respectively as deputy [[Barney Fife]] and Lou-Ann Poovie, [[Gomer Pyle]]'s girlfriend in the later seasons of ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]''.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], there was a mine known as a limpet, a type of naval mine attached to a target by magnets named because of their superficial similarity to the limpet, a type of mollusk. \"Das Limpet\" was the German Navy's identification of Don Knott's character.\n\nThe destroyer {{USS|Alfred A. Cunningham|DD-752|6}} was the naval ship featured in this film. Another ship used in filming was the cruiser {{USS|Galveston|CLG-3|6}}, which was referred to as {{USS|Los Angeles}} in the film. The cruiser {{USS|Los Angeles|CA-135|6}} was offered for use at the time of pre-production planning, but was decommissioned late 1963, before principal filming began. Here lies a double anachronism, in that ''Los Angeles'' was not commissioned until late 1945, and ''Galveston'' had been converted to a guided missile cruiser, and clearly shows her 1960s configuration with large radars and missile launchers in place of her removed gun turrets.\n\nThe animated sequences were handled by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] under the supervision of [[Robert McKimson]], and it was the final project for the studio prior to its temporary closure in December 1963, as well as one of the few non-''[[Looney Tunes]]'' productions they worked on.<ref name=\"endofstudio\">Barrier, Michael (1999).
