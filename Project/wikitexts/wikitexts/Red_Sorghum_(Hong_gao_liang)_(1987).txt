It is based on the first two parts of the novel ''[[Red Sorghum (novel)|Red Sorghum]]'' by Nobel laureate [[Mo Yan]].\n\nThe film marked the directorial debut of internationally acclaimed filmmaker [[Zhang Yimou]], and the acting debut of film star [[Gong Li]].  With its lush and lusty portrayal of peasant life, it immediately vaulted Zhang to the forefront of the [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] directors. The film won the Golden Bear Award at Berlin Film Festival.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film takes place in a rural village in China's eastern province of [[Shandong]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It is narrated from the point of view of the protagonist\u2019s grandson, who reminisces about his grandmother, Jiu'er. She was a poor girl who was sent by her parents into a pre-arranged marriage with an old man, Li Datou, who owned a sorghum wine distillery and who had leprosy.\n\nAs Jiu'er's wedding party crosses a field of sorghum, they are attacked by a bandit. One of the men hired to carry Jiu'er's sedan chair manages to fight off the assailant. After Jiu'er safely reaches the distillery, her rescuer, whom she has been eyeing during the trip, disappears. During Jiu'er's trip back to her parents' village, a bandit with a mask jumps out of the sorghum field and, after chasing down Jiu'er, carries her off into the sorghum stalks. Jiu'er runs away at first, but when the bandit takes off his mask and reveals himself to be her chair man and rescuer, she stops resisting his pursuit and has sex with him.\n\nUpon Jiu'er's return to the distillery, it is discovered that Li Datou has died of mysterious causes, leading many of the distillery's workers to suspect murder. Nothing is proven, however, and since Jiu'er's late husband was without heir, it is she who takes ownership of the distillery, which has recently fallen on hard times. She inspires the workers to take new pride in their wine. One day, Jiu'er's lover and the narrator's grandfather becomes drunk and loudly insists to the group of men accompanying him that he is going to share her bed. When he enters the bedroom, however, she, embarrassed, tosses him out. The other men on the scene carry him away, sticking him in an empty wine vat where he remains for the next three days. Meanwhile, a group of bandits kidnap Jiu'er, forcing the distillery workers to pay a ransom for her freedom.\n\nAfter emerging from the vat, the narrator's grandfather witnesses the worn down Jiu'er. The narrator's grandfather goes to confront the leader of the bandits, demanding to know whether the leader raped Jiu'er. The leader said he did not rape Jiu'er, because Jiu'er told the leader that she already slept with the disease-ridden old man Li Datou. The narrator's grandfather returns, but takes out his anger on the workers by urinating into four vats of liquor. To the clan's surprise, the urine somehow makes the liquor taste better than ever. Its product newly improved, the distillery begins to see financial success.\n\nThe War begins and Imperial Japanese Army troops invade the area. The Japanese soldiers then torture and kill Jiu'er's friend Luohan, a respected distillery worker. Jiu'er incites the workers to avenge his death. In the early dawn, they hide themselves in the sorghum field, prepared to ambush the Japanese military vehicles the moment they pass by. While waiting, however, the workers become distracted by hunger. When Jiu'er is informed of this by her young child (the narrator's father), she brings out some lunch for the workers. Arriving just as the Japanese soldiers do, Jiu'er is shot and killed in the chaotic skirmish that ensues, and the explosive traps meant for the Japanese trucks end up killing almost everyone at the scene. Only the narrator's grandfather and father manage to survive the encounter.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gong Li]] as \"My Grandma\"\n*[[Jiang Wen]] as \"My Grandpa\"\n*[[Ji Chunhua]] as Sanbao the bandit chieftain\n*[[Teng Rujun]] as Uncle Luohan\n\n==Style==\nLike Zhang's later film, ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' (1999), ''Red Sorghum'' is narrated by the main characters' grandson, but ''Red Sorghum'' lacks the flashback framing device of ''The Road Home'' (the viewer never sees the narrator).\n\nThe cinematography by cinematographer [[Gu Changwei]] makes use of rich, intense colors. Zhang himself was a cinematographer prior to his directorial debut, and worked closely with Gu. The use of red showcases the rich vitality of the sorghum fields, as well as the director's personal style.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ng |first=Yvonne |date=1995-04-10 |title=Imagery and Sound in Red Sorghum |url=https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/kinema/article/view/777 |journal=Kinema: A Journal for Film and Audiovisual Media |language=en |doi=10.15353/kinema.vi.777 |s2cid=202856150 |issn=2562-5764}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release, ''Red Sorghum'' garnered international acclaim, most notably winning the coveted [[Golden Bear]] at the 1988 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] said, in his review and synopsis in ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', \"There is a strength in the simplicity of this story, in the almost fairy-tale quality of its images and the shocking suddenness of its violence, that Hollywood in its sophistication has lost.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Red Sorghum|journal=Chicago Sun-Times|date=February 28, 1989|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890228/REVIEWS/902280301/1023}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n*[[38th Berlin International Film Festival]], [[1988 in film|1988]]\n**[[Golden Bear]] Award<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1988/03_preistr_ger_1988/03_Preistraeger_1988.html |title=Berlinale: 1988 Prize Winners |access-date=2011-03-06 |work=berlinale.de |archive-date=2014-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101063851/http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1988/03_preistr_ger_1988/03_Preistraeger_1988.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*[[Hundred Flowers Awards]], [[1988 in film|1988]]\n**Best Feature\n*[[Golden Rooster Awards]], [[1988 in film|1988]]\n**Best Feature\n**Best Cinematography - [[Gu Changwei]]\n**Best Sound\n**Best Music - [[Zhao Jiping]]\n**Best Director - Zhang Yimou (nominated)\n**Best Actor - [[Jiang Wen]] (nominated)\n**Best Art Direction - [[Yang Gang (filmmaker)|Yang Gang]] (nominated)\n*[[Zimbabwe International Film Festival]], [[1988 in film|1988]]\n**Best Picture\n**Best Director - Zhang Yimou\n**Best Artistic Achievement\n*[[Sydney Film Festival]], [[1988 in film|1988]]\n**Film Critics Award\n*[[Brussels Film Festival (BRFF)|Brussels International Film Festival]], [[1989 in film|1989]]\n**Belgian French Radio Young Jury Award for Best Picture\n*[[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[1989 in film|1989]]\n**Silver Panda\n*[[Hong Kong International Film Festival]], [[1989 in film|1989]]\n**Top Ten Chinese Language Films\n*[[German Democratic Republic Filmmakers Award]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Annual Award\n*[[Cuba Film Festival]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Best Feature Film\n\n=== Accolades ===\n*''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' 100 Best Chinese Mainland Films \u2013 #12<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/10/20-11.html|title=100 Best Chinese Mainland Films|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Film|1980s}}\n* [[List of submissions to the 61st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Chinese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Mo Yan]].
