It stars [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Charles Grodin]] and [[Donna Dixon]]. It is loosely based on the 1971 novel ''The Couch Trip'', by Ken Kolb.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=May 2015}}\nAlleged mental patient John Burns (Dan Aykroyd)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/couch_trip/|title=The Couch Trip|publisher=The Tomatometer|accessdate=2016-04-19}}</ref> is sent to Dr Lawrence Baird's office (David Clennon) after causing a riot in the hospital cafeteria. Dr Baird receives a message from his secretary that a patient was in need of him. As Dr Baird leaves his office, coincidentally Burns intercepts a [[telephone]] call from lawyer Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), requesting if Dr. Baird could fill in for Dr. George Maitlin (Charles Grodin) on his popular radio talk show.  Burns assumes Dr. Baird's identity and jumps at the chance to escape the hospital. With the help of Dr. Baird's [[secretary]], he breaks out and picks up a waiting ticket at the [[Chicago]] airport.\n\nBurns arrives in [[Los Angeles]], where he is met by Dr. Maitlin's radio show assistant Dr. Laura Rollins (Donna Dixon) and escorted to the waiting [[limousine]]. He crosses paths with Donald Becker (Walter Matthau), a crazy faux priest who is collecting money to save plants. Becker recognizes the trousers Burns is wearing to be prison issue.\n\nWhen the time comes to do the radio talk show, Burns is a huge hit, offering people free consultations and using profanity on the air. He even arranges for listeners to go to a baseball game at [[Dodger Stadium]] for free (where he also sings the National Anthem).\n\nAll goes well until Dr. Maitlin meets the real Dr. Baird in [[London]], when they both attend the same seminar. They fly back to L.A. to try to find what is going on behind their backs.\n\nBurns has been paid for the show (in cash) and is ready to leave town when he sees on the in-flight TV that Becker is on top of the [[Hollywood sign]] shouting Baird's name. Burns decides to go back and help to resolve the situation, where he is arrested only to be rescued on the way to the [[Prison|penitentiary]] by Becker and Dr. Rollins.\n\nIn the last few scenes of the movie, Burns gives his inmate number \"7474505B\" which is the same number that [[Jake Blues]] had in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and [[Louis Winthorpe III]] in ''[[Trading Places]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as John W.
