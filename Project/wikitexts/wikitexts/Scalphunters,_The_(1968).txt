He encounters a group of [[Kiowa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] led by Two Crows ([[Armando Silvestre]]), who take his furs. In exchange, they give a disgusted Bass a slave, Joseph Lee ([[Ossie Davis]]), whom they had previously taken from a group of [[Comanche]]s.\n\nLee is a well-educated and refined house slave, unfamiliar with the ways of the wilderness. Bass sets out to recover the furs from the Kiowa. Lee makes an unsuccessful attempt to escape, then follows along.\n\nAs Lee and Bass catch up to the Kiowa, they watch them being ambushed by a group of scalphunters, after the bounty offered by the government for each Native American scalp they bring in. The scalphunters, led by Jim Howie ([[Telly Savalas]]), kill the Kiowas and take Bass's furs. Bass and Lee trail the new group.\n\nLee stumbles over a cliff and is captured by the scalphunters. Howie decides to sell him in [[Galveston, Texas]]. As they travel southwards, Jim Howie's girlfriend, Kate ([[Shelley Winters]]), reveals to Lee that they are heading for [[Mexico]]. He begins to win her favor, by doing her hair and telling her fortune, hoping she will persuade Howie to take him with them to Mexico (where slavery is illegal), rather than sell him.\n\nBass pins them down with sniper fire, forcing them to let loose the packhorse carrying the furs. He is ambushed, however, and the scalphunters recover the furs and proceed on their way. Approaching their camp at night, Bass tries to persuade Lee to help him, but the slave is now set on going to Mexico and refuses him assistance.\n\nBass kills several of the scalphunters by starting a rock slide in the mountains. Then he contaminates the water of a nearby creek with [[locoweed]], a toxic plant that causes the scalphunters' horses to run and buck wildly after they drink the water. They send Lee as a go-between to Bass, telling him he can keep the furs. A wary Bass comes down to collect the lone packhorse, but is ambushed by Howie. In an ensuing struggle, Howie is shot dead by Lee. The bickering Bass and Lee then fight, but neither can beat the other.\n\nMeanwhile, Kiowas attack and overrun the scalphunters. Two Crows, who had survived the earlier massacre, has fetched reinforcements. He takes back the furs. Bass and Lee, now friends, prepare to follow the Kiowas to take back the furs.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] \u2013 Joe Bass\n* [[Shelley Winters]] \u2013 Kate\n* [[Telly Savalas]] \u2013 Jim Howie\n* [[Ossie Davis]] \u2013 Joseph Lee\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] \u2013 Jed\n* [[Paul Picerni]] \u2013 Frank\n* [[Dan Vadis]] \u2013 Yuma\n* [[Armando Silvestre]] \u2013 Two Crows\n* [[Nick Cravat]] \u2013 Yancy\n\n==Novelization==\nShortly before the release of the film, per the timing custom of the era, [[Gold Medal Books]] published a novelization of the screenplay by veteran pulpsmith [[Richard Wormser]] as \"Ed Friend\" (a pseudonym he employed for most of his media tie-in work). It qualifies as an \"inferred novelization\" as the source screenplay is not directly credited as the basis, though the copyright is assigned to Norland Productions and Bristol Pictures\u2014and the film is referenced on the front and back covers of the first edition. ''The Scalp-Hunters'' was not the only Gold Medal novelization of the era to tacitly disguise itself as a novel original to its author, and thus the basis for the film\u2014and in this case, the strategy seems to have paid off; the book stayed in print well beyond the theatrical run of the movie: Future editions of the book (there was a second printing and a re-release about a decade later) eschewed mention of the film altogether.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0063557}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|scalphunters}}\n* {{TCMDb title|17755}}\n* {{AllMovie title|43051}}\n\n{{Sydney Pollack|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scalphunters, The}}\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:1968 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sydney Pollack]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Burt Lancaster]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Mexico]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
