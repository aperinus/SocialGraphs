One day, the king leaves to fight a great evil that has invaded the land, but never returns. Clementianna becomes Queen and rules in his absence, while confining her young stepdaughter, Snow White, to the palace.\n\nTen years later, Snow White, now a young lady, desires to explore the kingdom and sneaks out. Walking through the forest, she meets the visiting Prince Andrew Alcott, a prince from the Kingdom of Valencia, who has been robbed by a band of [[seven dwarfs|Dwarves]]; she and the prince are instantly smitten with each other. Snow White arrives in the town, and finds the people are destitute due to the Queen's heavy taxation.\n\nMeanwhile, Clementianna is introduced to Alcott and plans to marry him for his wealth. Clementianna throws a ball to woo the Prince, and Snow White secretly attends, planning to ask the prince to help her restore the kingdom. Clementianna notices Snow White and the prince dancing and orders her manservant Brighton to take the princess into the forest and feed her to the beast. Brighton leaves Snow White in the forest, but she runs away from the beast, collapsing at the door to the dwarves' hideout.  The dwarves take her in and introduce themselves as Grimm, Butcher, Wolf, Napoleon, Half Pint, Grub, and Chuck. When Brighton collects more taxes levied by the queen to pay for her expensive parties, the dwarves rob him. Snow White takes the money and returns it to the townspeople, crediting the dwarves, whom the people hail as heroes.\n\nClementianna informs Alcott that Snow White is dead. When the prince finds out that the bandits have robbed Brighton, he goes after them. In the forest, Alcott discovers that Snow White is alive and in league with the dwarves, who have trained her in combat. Each believing the other to be in the wrong, Snow White and Alcott duel. Alcott returns to the palace defeated and informs the queen that Snow White is alive.\n\nClementianna enters her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Mirror House]], within which lives her reflection, the Mirror Queen. Clementianna has the Mirror Queen temporarily turn Brighton into a cockroach, and requests a love potion so she can make the prince fall in love with her. The potion turns out to be a 'puppy love' potion and the prince becomes devoted to her like a puppy dog. Under this spell, the prince agrees to marry her. Using [[Black magic|dark magic]], the queen attacks Snow White and the dwarves with two giant [[marionettes]]; but Snow White defeats them by finding and cutting their strings.\n\nOn the day of her wedding, Clementianna arrives to find that Snow White and the dwarves have robbed the party and abducted the Prince; for her inability to handle bandits and for lying about Snow White's death, the aristocrats demand the queen be deposed. Back in the forest, Snow White manages to break the spell on Alcott with true love's kiss.\n\nSnow White encounters Clementianna, who sends the beast after her. Prince Alcott tries to save Snow White, but the Beast captures her. However, the beast hesitates in killing her and Snow White sees that it wears a necklace with a moon charm on it similar to the one the queen wears. Snow White cuts the necklace off, breaking Clementianna\u2019s spell, and restoring the beast to its true form: Snow White\u2019s father. Clementianna begins to age rapidly and the Mirror Queen explains this is her punishment for using dark magic.\n\nGrateful to Alcott for his assistance, the king agrees to let him marry Snow White. At the wedding, an old hag appears and offers Snow White an apple as a wedding gift. At first, Snow White accepts the apple; but, as she is about to bite it, she realizes that the old hag is Clementianna. Snow White cuts a piece from the apple with her father's dagger and gives it to Clementianna, who reluctantly accepts it. The Mirror House shatters declaring it Snow White's story after all. Snow White, Prince Alcott, the King and the dwarves live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lily Collins]] as [[Snow White|Princess Snow White]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Clementianna]], Snow White's evil stepmother.\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Prince Andrew Alcott, the Prince of Valencia.\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Brighton, the Queen's executive bootlicker.\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Margaret, the royal [[baker]] who was Snow White's friend since childhood.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as [[Baron|the Baron]], an elite member of the kingdom who is often recommended for Queen Clementianna to get engaged to.\n* [[Sean Bean]] as [[King (Snow White)|the King]], the father of Snow White, who went missing.\n* [[Danny Woodburn]] as Will Grimm, the leader of the Seven Dwarfs.

He stated that in the film, the queen is not evil, but rather insecure.

The site's general consensus is that \"Like most of Tarsem Singh's films, ''Mirror Mirror'' is undeniably beautiful \u2013 but its treatment of the age-old Snow White fable lacks enough depth or originality to set it apart from the countless other adaptations of the tale.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mirror_mirror_2012/|title=Mirror Mirror (2012)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|access-date=February 7, 2022}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, it has an average score of 46 from the 34 reviews, which indicates \"Mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mirror-mirror|title=Mirror Mirror |work=Metacritic |publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRobbie Collin from British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the film four stars describing it as \"an exuberantly charming fairy story that owes as much to the gnarled folk tale illustrations of [[Arthur Rackham]] as the stagey, saturated lunacy of that half-loved, half-feared East German fantasy ''[[The Singing Ringing Tree]]''. It's a Grimm piece of work, but far from a grim one: without rehashing the seminal Disney animated version, it radiates gorgeousness and good humour with a near-nuclear intensity.\" Collin praised costume designer [[Eiko Ishioka]]'s work, saying \"every outfit in ''Mirror Mirror'' is a masterpiece\". He concluded the film is \"the opposite of [[Tim Burton]]'s brash, chaotic, dispiritingly popular ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'': here, the artistry of the cast and crew leaps off the screen, not 3D computer graphics.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Mirror, Mirror \u2013 review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/9175658/Mirror-Mirror-review.html|work=[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|access-date=March 30, 2012|date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nOn its opening day, ''Mirror Mirror'' made $5.8 million, coming in at the No. 3 spot behind ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Subers|first=Ray|title=Friday Report: 'Hunger Games' Easily Tops 'Wrath,' 'Mirror'|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3405|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=April 2, 2012|date=March 31, 2012}}</ref> For its opening weekend, the film earned $18.1 million while holding onto the No. 3 spot at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ray|last=Subers|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3406&p=.htm |title=Weekend Report: 'Wrath,' 'Mirror' No Match for 'Hunger Games'|website=Box Office Mojo|date=April 1, 2012|access-date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> During its theatrical run, ''Mirror Mirror'' grossed $64.9 million in North America and $118.1 million internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $183 million.<ref name=BoxOfficeMojo />\n\n===Home media===\n''Mirror Mirror'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] on June 26, 2012.<ref name=\"Mirror Mirror @ ETA\" />\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
