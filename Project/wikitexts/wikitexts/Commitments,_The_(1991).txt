It was directed by [[Alan Parker]] from a screenplay written by Doyle, [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]]. Set in the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside of Dublin]], the film tells the story of Jimmy Rabbitte ([[Robert Arkins]]), a young music fanatic who assembles a group of working-class youths to form a [[soul music|soul]] band named \"The Commitments\". The film is the first in a series known as ''[[The Barrytown Trilogy]]'', followed by ''[[The Snapper (film)|The Snapper]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Van (1996 film)|The Van]]'' (1996).\n\nProducers [[Lynda Myles (British producer)|Lynda Myles]] and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights to the novel in 1988, and commissioned Doyle, a first-time screenwriter, to write an adaptation. Doyle spent one year working on the script before Myles brought in veteran screenwriters Clement and La Frenais to help complete it. Upon reading the novel, Parker signed on as the film's director in 1989. An [[Co-production (media)|international co-production]] between [[Ireland]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], ''The Commitments'' was the first film produced by [[Beacon Pictures]], which provided an estimated [[production budget|budget]] of $12\u201315 million. The film's young lead actors were mostly inexperienced, and were cast because of their musical backgrounds and resemblance to the characters in the novel. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Dublin]], from late August to October, 1990.\n\n''The Commitments'' underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $14.9 million during its theatrical run. Reviewers praised the music, performances and humour, while criticism was occasionally aimed at the pacing and Parker's direction. The film resulted in two soundtrack albums released by [[MCA Records]]; the first reached #8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|album chart]] and achieved [[British Phonographic Industry#Certifications|triple-platinum status]], while the second album achieved gold sales status. At the [[45th British Academy Film Awards|1992 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won four of six [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]]. It also received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film has since gained [[cult film|cult status]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] of [[Dublin]], Ireland, Jimmy Rabbitte is a young music fanatic who aspires to manage an Irish [[Soul music|soul]] band in the tradition of 1960s African-American recording artists. He places an advert in the local newspaper and holds auditions in his parents' home. After being deluged by several unsuitable performers, Jimmy decides to put together a band consisting of friends and people he encounters\u2014lead singer Deco Cuffe, guitarist Outspan Foster, keyboardist Steven Clifford, alto saxophonist Dean Fay, bassist Derek Scully, drummer Billy Mooney, and female backup singers Bernie McGloughlin, Natalie Murphy and Imelda Quirke. Jimmy then meets trumpeter Joey \"The Lips\" Fagan, a veteran musician who offers his services, and has unlikely stories about meeting and working with famous musicians. Joey names the band \"The Commitments\".\n\nAfter purchasing a drum set and acquiring a piano from Steven's Grandmother, Jimmy secures the remainder of the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a [[black market]] dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a [[snooker]] hall, and after much practice, they convince a local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-[[heroin]] campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.\n\nTensions run high among the band members, as Joey seduces Natalie, then Bernie, then Imelda, all while Deco grows increasingly obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue where, at the end of one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his [[hi-hat]] cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear of going to jail if he beats up Deco{{snd}}much to Jimmy's frustration{{snd}}and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a [[roller disco]], Jimmy is confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.\n\nAfter the band secures another gig, Joey promises Jimmy that he can get his friend, [[Wilson Pickett]], to sing alongside them. On this promise, Jimmy convinces several journalists to attend the band's next performance. At the venue, the band draws a large crowd, but its members begin arguing with each other offstage, and become doubtful when it appears that Pickett will not show. They go back on stage, where Deco denounces Jimmy for misleading the audience about Pickett's appearance; the band's performance of one of Pickett's songs, \"[[In the Midnight Hour]]\", silences the crowd's protests. After the performance, the fighting continues; during a heated argument, Mickah beats up Deco outside the club, and Jimmy storms off in frustration, claiming that the band is finished. Joey follows Jimmy, who berates him for misleading the band about Pickett. Just as Joey leaves, Pickett's limousine pulls up next to Jimmy, and his driver asks for directions to the club. In a closing monologue, Jimmy explains that the band's members have since gone their separate ways, with many of them continuing to pursue musical careers, and implies that he and Natalie are in a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits, four-per-page and five-per-page scroll (17 credits) -->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Arkins]] as Jimmy Rabbitte \u2013 manager\n* Michael Aherne as Steven Clifford \u2013 piano, keyboards\n* [[Angeline Ball]] as Imelda Quirke \u2013 vocals\n* [[Maria Doyle Kennedy|Maria Doyle]] as Natalie Murphy \u2013 vocals\n* Dave Finnegan as Mickah Wallace \u2013 drums\n* [[Bronagh Gallagher]] as Bernie McGloughlin \u2013 vocals\n* F\u00e9lim Gormley as Dean Fay \u2013 alto saxophone \n* [[Glen Hansard]] as Outspan Foster \u2013 guitars\n* Dick Massey as Billy Mooney \u2013 drums\n* Johnny Murphy as Joey \"The Lips\" Fagan \u2013 trumpet\n* Kenneth McCluskey as Derek Scully \u2013 bass\n* [[Andrew Strong]] as Deco Cuffe \u2013 lead vocals\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Mr. Rabbitte\n* Anne Kent as Mrs. Rabbitte\n* Caroline Gardiner as Madame Rabbitte\n* [[Andrea Corr]] as Sharon Rabbitte\n* Gerard Cassoni as Darren Rabbitte\n* Oliver Crocombe as Mr Bunny Rabbitte Esquire\n* Ruth&Lindsay Fairclough as the Rabbitte Twins<!-- credited as Ruth&Lindsay, a single word -->\n}}\n\nIn addition, comedian [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]] played Dave from Eejit Records while Maura O'Malley played Joey's mother.
