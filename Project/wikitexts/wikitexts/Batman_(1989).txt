Produced by [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], it is the first installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Tim Burton]] and stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Robert Wuhl]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Michael Gough]], and [[Jack Palance]]. The film takes place early in [[Batman (1989 film series character)|the title character]]'s war on crime and depicts his conflict with his [[archenemy]] [[Joker (Jack Napier)|The Joker]].\n\nAfter Burton was hired as director in 1986, [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Julie Hickson]] wrote [[film treatment]]s before [[Sam Hamm]] wrote the first screenplay. ''Batman'' was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). The tone and themes of the film were partly influenced by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Brian Bolland]]'s ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' and [[Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''. The film primarily adapts and diverts from the \"[[The Man Behind the Red Hood!|Red Hood]]\" [[origin story]] for the Joker, having Batman inadvertently cause [[gangster]] Jack Napier to fall into Axis Chemical acid, triggering his transformation into the [[psychotic]] Joker. Additionally, Batman creator [[Bob Kane]] worked as consultant for the film.\n\nNumerous [[A-list]] actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast. Keaton's casting was controversial since, by 1988, he had become [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role.<ref name=\"Elfman\" /> Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated top [[Billing (filmmaking)|billing]], a portion of the film's earnings (including associated merchandise), and his own shooting schedule.\n\nFilming took place at [[Pinewood Studios]] from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30&nbsp;million to $48&nbsp;million, while the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced Hamm to drop out. [[Warren Skaaren]] did rewrites, with additional uncredited drafts done by [[Charles McKeown]] and [[Jonathan Gems]].\n\n''Batman'' was both critically and financially successful, earning over $400&nbsp;million in box office totals. Critics and audiences particularly praised Nicholson and Keaton's performances, Burton's direction, the production design, and Elfman's score. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several [[Saturn Award]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Nicholson's performance, and won the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]]. It also inspired the equally successful ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', paving the way for the [[DC Animated Universe]], and has influenced [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre. The film was followed by three sequels: ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), with both Burton and Keaton returning; ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), which featured [[Val Kilmer]] in the lead role; and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), which featured [[George Clooney]] in the role.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Gotham City]] approaches its [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]], Mayor Borg orders district attorney [[Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)|Harvey Dent]] and police [[Jim Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]] to make the city safer by incarcerating mob boss Carl Grissom. Meanwhile, reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist [[Vicki Vale (1989 film series character)|Vicki Vale]] investigate sightings of a masked vigilante called \"[[Batman (1989 film series character)|Batman]]\" who is targeting the city's criminals. Both attend a fundraiser hosted by billionaire industrialist [[Bruce Wayne (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne]], who is secretly Batman, having chosen this path after witnessing a mugger murder his parents when he was a child. During the event, Wayne becomes infatuated with Vale, but interrupts their meeting to secretly pursue Gordon when he leaves on police business.\n\nGrissom sends his sociopathic second-in-command [[Joker (Jack Napier)|Jack Napier]] to raid Axis Chemicals to retrieve incriminating evidence, though it is a cover to have Napier murdered for sleeping with his mistress Alicia Hunt. Although corrupt police lieutenant Max Eckhardt arranges the hit on Napier by conducting an unauthorized police operation, Gordon arrives, takes command, and orders officers to capture Napier alive as a potential witness. Batman also arrives to catch Napier, who kills Eckhardt as revenge for double-crossing him. During a scuffle with Batman, Napier topples off a catwalk and falls into a vat of acidic chemicals. Although presumed dead, Napier survives with various disfigurements including chalk white skin and emerald green hair and nails. He undergoes surgery to repair the damage, but ends up with a [[Risus sardonicus|rictus grin]]. Driven insane by his new appearance, Napier, now calling himself \"[[Joker (Jack Napier)|the Joker]]\", kills Grissom at his estate, massacres Grissom's associates, and takes over his operations.\n\nBatman researches a way to stop the Joker from terrorizing Gotham with hygiene products laced with \"Smylex\" \u2013 a deadly chemical that causes victims to [[Death from laughter|die laughing]]. The Joker soon becomes obsessed with Vicki and lures her to the Gotham Museum of Art, where his henchmen [[Vandalism|destroy the works of art]] within. Batman arrives and rescues Vicki before taking her to his [[Batcave]], providing her with all of his research on Smylex that will allow the city's residents to escape the toxin. Conflicted with his love for her, Wayne visits her apartment intending to reveal his secret identity, only for the Joker to interrupt the meeting. The Joker asks Wayne, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\", which Wayne recognizes as the catchphrase used by the mugger who killed his parents. The Joker shoots Wayne, but he survives thanks to a serving tray hidden underneath his shirt. Wayne escapes while the Joker is distracted. At the Batcave, Wayne reminisces on his parents' murder and realizes that the Joker killed them.\n\nVicki is taken to the Batcave by Wayne's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]], who had been coaxing the relationship between the pair to bring out Wayne's human side. After exposing his secret to Vicki, Wayne reveals he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker on the loose and departs to destroy the Axis plant used to create Smylex. Meanwhile, the Joker lures Gotham's citizens to a parade with the promise of free money, in order to dose them with Smylex gas held within giant parade balloons. Batman foils his plan by using his [[Batplane|Batwing]] to remove the balloons, but the Joker shoots him down. The Batwing crashes in front of a cathedral, and the Joker takes Vicki hostage within it. Batman pursues the Joker to the top of the cathedral, and in the ensuing fight, he reveals that he knows Napier killed his parents and thus, indirectly created Batman before the latter created the Joker, leading the Joker to realize Batman is Bruce Wayne. The Joker eventually pulls Batman and Vicki over the balcony of the cathedral, leaving them hanging while he attempts to escape by calling in a helicopter piloted by his goons, who throw down a ladder for him to climb. However, Batman uses a grappling hook to attach the Joker's leg to a [[gargoyle]]. The crumbling gargoyle falls off the roof and drags the Joker down. Unable to bear its immense weight, the Joker falls to his death while Batman and Vicki make it to safety.\n\nSometime later, Gordon announces that the police have arrested all of the Joker's men and unveils the [[Bat-Signal]]. Dent reads a note from Batman, promising that he will defend Gotham should crime strike again, and asks them to use the Bat-Signal to summon him in times of need. Alfred takes Vicki to [[Wayne Manor]], explaining that Wayne will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (Jack Napier)|Jack Napier/the Joker]]\n** [[Hugo Blick|Hugo E.

The success of ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and the [[graphic novel]] ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''The Killing Joke''.<ref name=\"Elfman\" /> Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986.<ref name=\"Steve\">{{cite web | title = Batman | work = [[Steve Englehart]].com | url = http://www.steveenglehart.com/Film/Batman%20movie.html | access-date = November 25, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214111803/http://www.steveenglehart.com/Film/Batman%20movie.html| archive-date= December 14, 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref> Like Mankiewicz's script, it was based on his own ''Strange Apparitions'' and included Silver St. Cloud, Dick Grayson, the Joker, and Rupert Thorne, as well as a [[cameo appearance]] by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]].
