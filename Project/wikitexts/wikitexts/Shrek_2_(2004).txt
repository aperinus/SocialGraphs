The sequel to [[Shrek (film)|''Shrek'']] (2001) and the second installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]], the film was directed by [[Andrew Adamson]], [[Kelly Asbury]], and [[Conrad Vernon]] from a screenplay written by Adamson, [[Joe Stillman]], J. David Stem, and [[David N. Weiss]]. It stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Julie Andrews]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[John Cleese]], [[Rupert Everett]], and [[Jennifer Saunders]]. In the film, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (Myers) and [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (Murphy) team up with the swashbuckling cat [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] (Banderas) to foil plans by [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]]'s (Diaz) [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]] (Saunders) to destroy Shrek and Fiona's marriage.\n\nDevelopment began in 2001, and following disagreements with producers, the first film's screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] were replaced with Adamson. The story was inspired by ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), and new animation tools were utilized to improve the visual appearance of each character, particularly Puss in Boots. The lead actors also received a significant bump in salary to $10 million, which at the time was among the highest contracts in their respective careers.

See WP:FILMPLOT for more details. -->\nNewlyweds [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Princess Fiona|Fiona]] return from their [[honeymoon]] to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek initially refuses to attend, but Fiona convinces him, and along with [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, [[King Harold (Shrek)|King Harold]] and [[Queen Lillian (Shrek)|Queen Lillian]], who are shocked to see the ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument and Fiona, disgusted at their behavior, locks herself away in her room. Shrek worries that he is losing Fiona, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with [[Prince Charming (Shrek)|Prince Charming]].\n\nHarold is reprimanded by the [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]], as her son, Prince Charming, was to marry Fiona in exchange for Harold's own happy ending. She orders him to get rid of Shrek, so Harold arranges for [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] to assassinate him under the guise of a hunting trip. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to be an ally. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss sneak into the Fairy Godmother's factory and steal a \"Happily Ever After\" potion that Shrek thinks will make him good enough for Fiona. Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion but nothing happens. Shrek laments before he and Donkey both suddenly fall asleep. Meanwhile, in Far Far Away, Fiona prepares to find Shrek so they can return home, but she too falls asleep.\n\nThe following morning, the potion's effects are clear: Shrek and Fiona are human, and Donkey is a white [[stallion]]. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the theft, has sent Charming to pose as Shrek and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.\n\nFiona does not reciprocate Charming's advances, so to ensure she falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal [[knight]]s. While the royal ball begins, the [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingerbread Man]], [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]], the [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]], the [[Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|Three Little Pigs]], and the [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Three Blind Mice]] rescue the trio and they storm the castle with the help of the [[Muffin Man]]'s monster-sized [[gingerbread man]].\n\nShrek fails to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love, Fiona knocks him out; Harold reveals that he didn't give Fiona the love potion. The now-enraged Fairy Godmother tries to kill Shrek with her [[magic wand]], but Harold jumps in front of it; the spell ricochets off his armor and disintegrates her. With the Fairy Godmother gone, Harold reverts back into the [[The Frog Prince|Frog Prince]]. Harold apologizes, admitting to using the \"Happily Ever After\" potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love, and approves Shrek and Fiona's marriage. Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him.\n\nAs the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain human, and they revert into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal. In the [[mid-credits scene]], [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]], who had previously married Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] babies.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Shrek characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Queen Lillian]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[List of Shrek characters|King Harold]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[Prince Charming (Shrek)|Prince Charming]]\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]]\n* [[Joan Rivers]] as [[List of characters in the Shrek series|Red Carpet Announcer]]\n**[[Kate Thornton]] provides the voice for the UK version\n* [[Larry King]] as [[Doris and Mabel (Shrek)|Doris the Ugly Stepsister]]\n**[[Jonathan Ross]] provides the voice for the UK version\n* [[Aron Warner]] as [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]]\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as:\n** [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]]\n** [[The Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|The Three Little Pigs]]\n* [[Christopher Knights]] and [[Simon J.
