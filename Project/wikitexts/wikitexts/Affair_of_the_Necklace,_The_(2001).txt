The screenplay by John Sweet is based on what became known as the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]], an incident that helped fuel the French populace's disillusionment with the [[monarchy]] and, among other causes, eventually led to the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/161488/Affair-of-the-Diamond-Necklace |title = Affair of the Diamond Necklace &#124; Summary & Facts}}</ref> The film received negative reviews from critics, but the sets, music and costume design were praised.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242252/awards?ref_=tt_awd |title = The Affair of the Necklace}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Comtesse de la Motte|Jeanne de Saint-R\u00e9my de Valois]], orphaned at an early age, is determined to reclaim her noble title and the home taken from her family when she was a child. When she is rebuffed by [[Marie Antoinette]] and fails to achieve her goal through legal channels, she joins forces with the arrogant, well-connected [[gigolo]] [[R\u00e9taux de Villette]] and her own wayward, womanizing husband [[Nicholas de Lamotte|Nicholas]]. They concoct a plan to earn her enough money to purchase the property.\n\nIn 1772, [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] had commissioned [[Paris]]ian [[jewellers]] Boehmer & Bassenge to create an opulent {{convert|2800|carat|g|adj = on}}, 647-diamond necklace to present to his mistress [[Madame du Barry]], but the king died before it was completed. Hoping to recover the high cost of the necklace, its creators try to persuade Queen Marie Antoinette to purchase it. Knowing its history, she declines.\n\nJeanne approaches debauched libertine [[Louis Ren\u00e9 \u00c9douard|Cardinal Louis de Rohan]] and introduces herself as a [[confidante]] of the Queen. For years the Cardinal has yearned to regain the Queen's favor and acquire the position of [[Prime Minister of France]], and when he is reassured by [[occultist]] [[Alessandro Cagliostro|Count Cagliostro]] that Jeanne is legitimate, he allows himself to be seduced by her promise to intervene on his behalf. He begins to correspond with the Queen and is unaware that his letters to her are intercepted and the Queen's responses are [[forgery|forgeries]] intended to manipulate him.  The tone of the letters becomes very intimate. The cardinal becomes more and more convinced that Marie Antoinette is in love with him, and he becomes ardently enamored of her.\n\nJeanne allegedly arranges a meeting between the two in the gardens of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Portraying the Queen is Nicole Leguay d'Oliva, a prostitute bearing some resemblance to her. Heavily cloaked, with her face in the shadows, she agrees to forget their past disagreements. The Cardinal believes his indiscretions have been forgiven and he once again is in the Queen's good favor.\n\nJeanne advises the Cardinal the Queen has decided to purchase the necklace but, not wanting to offend the populace by openly buying such an expensive trinket, she wishes him to do so on her behalf, with a promise to reimburse him for the cost by the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]]. The Cardinal gladly agrees and presents the necklace to R\u00e9taux de Villette, believing him to be an emissary from the Queen. Nicholas de Lamotte sells some of the diamonds, and Jeanne uses the profits to buy her family home.\n\nThe Cardinal begins to panic when Jeanne disappears and his correspondence with the Queen comes to an abrupt end. Nicholas is almost arrested for selling without proper certification, but he escapes. Jeanne advises him to not sell anymore diamonds in Paris. She sends correspondence to the jewelers, saying that Antoinette is no longer interested in the necklace and they must ask the Cardinal for reimbursement. However, Minister Breteuil comes upon an anxious Boehmer on his way to the Cardinal's estate. The Cardinal is invited to visit the palace on the Feast of the Assumption, at which time he assumes he will be repaid in full and named Prime Minister. Instead, [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], who has been made aware of his machinations by Minister Breteuil, has him imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. Soon to follow are everyone else involved in the plot, excluding Nicholas who fled to the border and into Austria. A trial finds the Cardinal, Count Cagliostro, and Nicole Leguay d'Oliva innocent of all charges. R\u00e9taux de Villette is found guilty and banished from France. Jeanne is found guilty and [[flagellation|whipped]] and [[Branding persons|branded]] before being imprisoned; she later escapes to [[London]] where she publishes her [[memoir]]s and regales the locals with her tales. Eventually, Marie Antoinette, assumed to be a key player in the affair by an increasingly angry and restless populace, meets her fate on the [[guillotine]]. Via an [[epilogue]], Breteuil explains that Jeanne never returned to France as she died after falling from her hotel room window and was rumored to have been killed by [[House of Bourbon|Royalists]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R\u00e9my|Jeanne de Saint-R\u00e9my de Valois]]\n** [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Young Jeanne de Saint-R\u00e9my de Valois\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[Louis Ren\u00e9 \u00c9douard, cardinal de Rohan|Cardinal Louis de Rohan]]\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Alessandro Cagliostro|Count Cagliostro]]\n* [[Simon Baker]] as [[R\u00e9taux de Villette]]\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as [[Nicholas de Lamotte]]\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as [[Marie Antoinette]]\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|Baron de Breteuil]]/[[Narrator]]\n* Simon Shackleton as [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]]\n* [[Hermione Gulliford]] as [[Nicole d'Oliva|Nicole Leguay d'Oliva]]\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nFilming locations included the Palace of Versailles, [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], [[Alincourt]], [[Compi\u00e8gne]], and Paris in [[France]], and [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutn\u00e1 Hora|St. Barbara Church]], [[Lednice]], and [[Valtice]] in the [[Czech Republic]].

In reality, she was a member of an illegitimate branch of the family, the house of Valois-Saint-Remy, descended from Henry de Saint R\u00e9my, an illegitimate son of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.audcent.com/audcent4/StRemy.htm | title=St Remy}}</ref><ref name=\"auto5\"/> \n* Jeanne had two siblings; an older brother, Jacques, and a younger sister Marie-Anne.

Her father was deep in debt and sold off the family property when Jeanne was young. There is no mention of him being a reformist, as portrayed in the film. He tried to regain his wealth when the family moved to Paris, but he died later and Jeanne's mother ran away, leaving her children to beg on the streets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=de la Motte de Valois|first1=Jeanne|title=The life of Jeanne de la Motte de Valois|date=1791|publisher=J.Bew}}</ref> Jeanne and her family was seen as no threat to the current monarchy. \n* In the film, [[Marie Antoinette]] explains that [[Madame du Barry]], Louis XV's mistress was recently banished from the French court. In fact, du Barry was banished from Versailles in 1774 shortly before the king died from [[smallpox]], and the necklace was presented to Antoinette in 1778, and again in 1781, she refused the necklace both times.<ref name=\"auto\">Marie Antoniette, by Stefan Zweig, originally published in 1932</ref><ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n* Jeanne was in fact a con-artist, who sought to use the necklace to gain wealth, power, and possibly royal patronage.

He did not sell any in Paris.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> \n* Jeanne did escape to London, disguised as a boy, where she died from falling from a hotel window in 1791. Some speculate that she was trying to hide from tax collectors, while others say it was an act of revenge from French royalists.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  \n* Count Cagliostro left France for England after he was acquitted. He later went to Rome, where he was accused and imprisoned for being a forger. He died at the [[Forte di San Leo|Fortress of San Leo]] in 1795.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/> \n* Cardinal de Rohan actually kept the forged letters. When he was arrested, he presented the letters and the sales contract to the king, the queen, the Minister of the Court, and the Keeper of the Seals. The king furiously pointed out the forged signature \"Marie Antoniette de France\" and stated that royalty do not use surnames.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Julia|title=Women in France during the Eighteenth Century, Volume 2|date=1893|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons}}</ref> In the film, de Rohan had the letters burned.\n* Cardinal de Rohan's acquittal received popular enthusiasm as a victory over the royal court, particularly the Queen. He was expelled from his position as grand almoner and he exiled himself to his abbey of [[La Chaise-Dieu|Chaise-Dieu]]. After the revolution, he left for [[List of bishops, prince-bishops and archbishops of Strasbourg|his bishopric]] at [[Strasbourg]] in [[Alsace]]. He died in [[Ettenheim]] in 1803.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''The Affair of the Necklace'' earned negative reviews from critics, with most of the criticism focusing on the casting of Hilary Swank as Jeanne, whom they felt didn't seem comfortable within the film's period setting and refined dialogue. The costume design and stylized period setting were praised. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 15% rating based on 62 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"A film about court intrigue, ''The Affair of the Necklace'' turns out to be more dull than juicy. Swank seems flat and miscast in the central role of Jeanne.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/affair_of_the_necklace |title=The Affair of the Necklace (2001) |access-date=Jun 3, 2021 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 42% based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" .<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-affair-of-the-necklace |title = The Affair of the Necklace |work=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] gave it 2 out of 4 and wrote: \"The storytelling is hopelessly compromised by the movie's decision to sympathize with Jeanne.
