The film grossed $77.5 million on a $28 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile [[Christmas and holiday season#Shopping|Christmas shopping]] at [[Bloomingdale's]] in [[New York City]], Jonathan Trager meets Sara Thomas when both try to buy the same pair of black [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] gloves. Despite both being in relationships, a mutual attraction leads them to have dessert at [[Serendipity 3]] where Sara explains that she lets fate's \"little signals\" determine many of her life decisions. After separating, they meet again when each returns to the restaurant to retrieve something they forgot. After ice skating, Jonathan convinces Sara to give him her number, but when the wind blows it out of his grasp, Sara thinks it is fate telling them to back off. After Jonathan disagrees, Sara decides to let fate reunite them: she has Jonathan write his number on a five [[United States dollar|dollar]] bill then uses it to buy breath mints and promises to sell her copy of ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' in which she will write her name and number. As one last experiment, Sara tosses Jonathan one of the gloves, they board separate elevators in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria]] and agree that if they arrive on the same floor, they are meant to be together. They each pick the same floor, but Jonathan is delayed finding Sara, leading her to believe that the experiment failed. Disappointed, they separate.\n\nYears later, Jonathan is an [[ESPN]] producer engaged to Halley and Sara is a therapist living in [[San Francisco]], engaged to internationally-renowned musician Lars. Jonathan runs across his cashmere glove, so he embarks on a search of the city with his best friend, Dean, to find Sara. Meanwhile, Sara, stressed by the wedding planning and Lars\u2019 focus on an upcoming world tour, travels to New York with her best friend Eve to find Jonathan. After nearly crossing paths with Jonathan throughout the day, Eve and Sara have dessert at Serendipity where Eve convinces Sara to give up her search. As Eve leaves, she picks up the 5 dollar bill with Jonathan's number on it that was left as their change. They catch the same cab that Jonathan and Dean exited while searching for Sara. After finding that a bridal shop next to Serendipity now occupies the address of a roommate finder service Sara once used, Jonathan sees it as a sign that he should marry Halley.\n\nAt the Waldorf Astoria, Eve and Sara encounter Halley headed to the wedding rehearsal. Halley invites Eve to join her since they were friends in college, but Sara declines. Outside their room, she finds an apologetic Lars.\n\nAt the rehearsal, Jonathan\u2019s distracted demeanor frustrates Halley. She tearfully pleads with him to focus on the wedding and he reassures her that his reservations have let go of him. Halley then gives him Sara's old book containing her phone number as a wedding gift. Jonathan and Dean get her address and fly to San Francisco. Once there, they see Sara's sister and her boyfriend having sex and assume it is Sara in a happy relationship. Dean helps Jonathan realize that he shouldn\u2019t marry Halley while Sara decides to end her engagement to Lars.\n\nThe next day, Sara finds the 5 dollar bill with Jonathan's number on it, having gotten hers and Eve's wallets mixed up. After getting his address and being told by the building superintendent of his wedding at the Waldorf, Sara hurries there and is relieved to find the ceremony has been cancelled.\n\nDean reassures Jonathan that he did the right thing and vows to be more spontaneous in his own marriage, which has been on the rocks. Jonathan wanders to the same ice skating rink where he spent part of his evening with Sara ten years earlier and finds a leather jacket on a bench. As it begins to snow, he lays on his back in the middle of the rink with the jacket as a pillow and one of the pair of cashmere gloves on his chest. When the matching glove lands next to him, he sits up and finds Sara watching him, having come to claim her jacket. They introduce themselves and finally share a kiss.\n\nLater they celebrate their anniversary at Bloomingdale\u2019s in front of the display of cashmere gloves where they met.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Jonathan Trager\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Sara Thomas\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Eve\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Halley Buchanan\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Dean Kansky\n* [[John Corbett]] as Lars Hammond\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Bloomingdale's salesman (Macall Polay)\n* Marcia Bennett as Mrs. Trager\n* Eve Crawford as Mrs. Buchanan\n* Evan Neuman as Kenny\n* [[Buck Henry]] (''uncredited'') as himself\n* [[Lucy Gordon (actress)|Lucy Gordon]] as Caroline Mitchell (Sara's sister)\n* [[Kevin Rice]] as Kip Mitchell\n* Gary Gerbrandt as Josh\n{{end div col}}\n\n==Production==\n''Serendipity'' was shot in [[New Jersey]], [[New York City]], [[Ontario]], and [[San Francisco, California]] in the summer of 2000.
