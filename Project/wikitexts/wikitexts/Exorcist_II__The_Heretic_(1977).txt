It is a [[sequel]] to [[William Friedkin]]'s 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist]]'' based on the 1971 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]] and the second installment of ''[[The Exorcist (film series)|The Exorcist]]'' series. The film is set four years after the original film and centers on the now 16-year-old [[Regan MacNeil]], who is still recovering from her previous [[demonic possession]].\n\nA critical failure at the time of its release, ''Exorcist II'' is often considered to be the [[List of films considered the worst#Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977)|one of the worst films ever made]]. It was the last film to feature veteran actor [[Paul Henreid]]. Despite a good return at the box office, the negative reception meant that the next film in the Exorcist series would not come until ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' (written and directed by Blatty) in 1990, which ignored the events of the second film.\n\n== Plot ==\nPhilip Lamont, a priest struggling with his faith, attempts to [[exorcism|exorcise]] a possessed girl in [[Rio de Janeiro]] who claims to \"heal the sick\". However, the exorcism goes wrong and a lit candle sets fire to the girl's dress, killing her. Afterward, Lamont is assigned by the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin, who had been killed four years earlier in the course of exorcising the [[Assyria]]n demon [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]] from [[Regan MacNeil]]. The Cardinal informs Lamont that Merrin is facing posthumous [[heresy]] charges because of his controversial writings, as Church authorities are trying to modernize and do not want to acknowledge that [[Satan]] exists.\n\nRegan, although now seemingly normal and staying with her guardian Sharon Spencer in New York City, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin. Regan claims that she remembers nothing about her ordeal in [[Washington, D.C.]], but Tuskin believes that her memories are [[Repressed memory|repressed]].\n\nFather Lamont visits the institute, but his attempts to question Regan about the circumstances of Merrin's death are rebuffed by Tuskin, who believes that Lamont's approach would do Regan more harm than good. In an attempt to plumb her memories of the exorcism, and specifically the circumstances in which Merrin died, Tuskin hypnotizes Regan, to whom she is linked by a \"synchronizer\", a revolutionary [[biofeedback]] device used by two people to synchronize their [[Neural oscillation|brainwaves]]. After a guided tour by Sharon of the [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] house where the [[exorcism]] took place, Lamont returns to be coupled with Regan by the synchronizer. The priest is spirited to the past by Pazuzu to observe Merrin exorcising a young boy, Kokumo, in Africa. Learning that the boy developed special powers to fight Pazuzu, who appears as a swarm of locusts, Lamont journeys to Africa, defying his superior, to seek help from the adult Kokumo.\n\nKokumo has become a scientist studying how to prevent [[locust]] swarms. Lamont learns that Pazuzu attacks people who have psychic healing abilities. Regan is able to reach telepathically inside the minds of others; she uses this to help an autistic girl to speak as she waits to see Tuskin. Tuskin and her staff are shocked, but the girl's mother is too overjoyed to care, and despite Tuskin's attempt to keep them in the office to figure out what happened, insists on going home so the girl's father can hear her as well. Father Merrin, who belonged to a group of theologians that believed psychic powers were a spiritual gift that would one day be shared by all people, thought people like Kokumo and Regan were forerunners of this new type of humanity. In a vision, Merrin asks Lamont to watch over Regan.\n\nLamont and Regan return to the old house in Georgetown. The pair are followed in a taxi by Tuskin and Sharon, who are concerned about Regan's safety.  En route, Pazuzu tempts Lamont by offering him unlimited power, appearing as a [[succubus]] who is a ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' of Regan. The taxi crashes into the Georgetown house, killing the driver, but his passengers survive and enter the house, where Sharon sets herself on fire. Although Lamont initially succumbs to the succubus, he is brought back by Regan and attacks her ''doppelg\u00e4nger'' while a swarm of locusts deluges the house, which begins to crumble around them. However, Lamont manages to kill the ''doppelg\u00e4nger'' by beating open its chest and pulling out its heart. In the end, Regan banishes the locusts (and Pazuzu) by enacting the same [[bullroarer]] ritual attempted by Kokumo to get rid of [[locusts]] in Africa (although he failed and was himself possessed). Outside the house, Sharon dies from her injuries and Tuskin tells Lamont to watch over Regan. Regan and Lamont leave while Tuskin stays to answer police questions.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Linda Blair]] as [[Regan MacNeil]]\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Father Philip Lamont\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Dr. Gene Tuskin\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Father Lankester Merrin]]\n* [[Kitty Winn]] as Sharon Spencer\n* [[Paul Henreid]] as The Cardinal\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Kokumo\n** Joey Green as Young Kokumo\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Edwards\n* Karen Knapp as The Voice of Pazuzu\n* [[Dana Plato]] as Sandra Phalor (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nNeither [[William Peter Blatty]] nor [[William Friedkin]], the writer/producer and the director, respectively, of the original ''[[The Exorcist]]'', had any desire to involve themselves in an ''Exorcist'' sequel.{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=156}} This was because they had filed lawsuits against both the studio and each other over profits, credits, and Blatty being barred from post-production during the first film.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Exorcist II: The Heretic |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/55889-EXORCIST-IITHEHERETIC?sid=5ef62dbf-4bf5-4bf5-9474-a81fb51a5265&sr=0.4241317&cp=1&pos=0 |access-date=2022-06-09 |website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Exorcist |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/54970-THE-EXORCIST?cxt=filmography |access-date=2022-06-09 |website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> According to the film's co-producer Richard Lederer, ''Exorcist II'' was conceived as a relatively low-budget affair: \"What we essentially wanted to do with the sequel was to redo the first movie ... Have the central figure, an investigative priest, interview everyone involved with the exorcism, then fade out to unused footage, unused angles from the first film. A low-budget rehash \u2014 about $3 million \u2014 of ''The Exorcist'', a rather cynical approach to movie-making, I'll admit. But that was the start\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=156}}\n\nPlaywright William Goodhart was commissioned to write the screenplay, titled ''The Heretic''; he based it around the theories of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (the [[Jesuit]] paleontologist/archaeologist who had inspired the character of Father Merrin in Blatty's novel ''The Exorcist''). Goodhart's screenplay took a more metaphysical and intellectual approach compared with the original film. Here, the battle between [[good and evil]] would center on [[Consciousness|human consciousness]]\u2014with the specific idea that, within the framework of [[Catholic theology]], human consciousnesses could be brought together as one through technology, although this would also result in conflict between those who sought good and evil. {{Sfn|Pallenberg|1977|p=72}}\n\n[[Sam O'Steen]] initially agreed to direct the film, but never officially attached himself to the production.<ref name=\":0\" /> British filmmaker [[John Boorman]] signed on to direct, stating that \"the idea of making a metaphysical thriller greatly appealed to my psyche\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=158}} Years earlier, Boorman had been considered by [[Warner Bros.]] as a possible director for the first ''Exorcist'' movie, but he turned the opportunity down because he found the story \"rather repulsive\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=158}} However, he was intrigued with the idea of directing a sequel, explaining that \"every film has to struggle to find a connection with its audience. Here I saw the chance to make an extremely ambitious film without having to spend the time developing this connection. I could make assumptions and then take the audience on a very adventurous cinematic journey\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=158}}\n\n===Casting===\nLinda Blair agreed to reprise her role of Regan MacNeil for ''Exorcist II'', but refused to wear demon make-up (a double was used for the brief flashback scenes depicting a demonic Regan). [[Max von Sydow]] was persuaded by Boorman to reprise the role of Father Merrin; he was initially reluctant to return because of his concerns over the negative impact of the first ''Exorcist'' film. [[Kitty Winn]] signed on to reprise the role of Sharon Spencer for ''Exorcist II'' after [[Ellen Burstyn]] flatly refused to return as Chris MacNeil.\n\nBoorman contacted [[William O'Malley (Jesuit)|William O'Malley]] to reprise his role as Father Joseph Dyer from the first film. However, O'Malley was busy and could not take up the part, and the character of Father Dyer was changed to Father Philip Lamont. [[Jon Voight]], [[David Carradine]], [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Christopher Walken]] all were considered for or offered the part of Father Lamont, who John Boorman initially conceived as a younger priest in awe of Father Merrin's writings. As mentioned in ''Variety'', Voight initially signed on for the role but left in April 1976 when \"differences about the role could not be resolved\".<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Burton replaces Jon Voight in Warner Bros.' \"The Heretic: Exorcist II\" |url=https://varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-04-21-1976-1 |magazine=Variety |publisher=Variety |date=1976-04-21 |access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref> He was replaced with [[Richard Burton]] signing on for the role.\n\nThe role of Dr. Gene Tuskin was originally written for a man, with [[Chris Sarandon]] and [[George Segal]] both considered. When the sex of the character was changed, both [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Jane Fonda]] were under consideration. [[Louise Fletcher]], who had just won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), accepted the part.\n\n===Screenplay and filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in May 24, 1976, at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Burbank Studios]] with a budget of $8 million (the film ultimately cost $11 million to make). Although Boorman wanted to film the majority of the film on location (including Ethiopia and [[Vatican City|The Vatican]]), many of his plans proved to be impossible, resulting in key exterior scenes having to be filmed set-bound at the Warner Bros. backlot. Even the MacNeil house in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] had to be replicated in the studio because the filmmakers were refused permission to film at the original house. The filmmakers also had to replicate the infamous \"Hitchcock Steps\" adjacent to the MacNeil house, as they were refused permission by Washington city officials to shoot scenes by the real steps.<ref>Bob McCabe, ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999), pp. 160\u2013162</ref> There were also two weeks of filming in the [[New York metropolitan area]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A key scene of a sleepwalking Regan about to wander off a rooftop was filmed in New York City, atop [[666 Fifth Avenue]] (where Warner Bros. offices were then located). With no stunt person and no special effects, the shot showed actress Linda Blair's feet on the edge of the building with [[Fifth Avenue]] down below.<ref>[http://www.littlereview.com/goddesslouise/articles/makexorc.htm Pallenberg, Barbara.

Goodhart refused, and so the script was subsequently rewritten by Pallenberg and Boorman. Goodhart's script was being constantly rewritten as the film was shooting, with the filmmakers uncertain as to how the story should end. Linda Blair recalled: \"It was a really good script at first. Then after everybody signed on they rewrote it five times and it ended up nothing like the same movie\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=165}}\n\n''Exorcist II'' was beset by numerous problems during production. Boorman himself contracted a case of [[San Joaquin Valley Fever]] (a respiratory fungal infection), which canceled production for over a month (a costly delay). Other problems included footage being oversaturated and necessitating reshoots; the rapid deaths of locusts imported from England for the film's climactic scenes (2500 locusts were shipped in and died at a rate of 100 a day); original film editor John Merritt quitting the production (he was replaced by [[Tom Priestley]]), and stars Kitty Winn and Louise Fletcher both suffering from gall bladder infections.<ref>Bob McCabe, ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999), pp. 160\u2013163</ref>\n\nBlair said in one interview that Pallenberg directed a lot of the film as well as did rewrites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://captainhowdy.com/2010/07/linda-blair-reflects-on-the-devil-inside|title=Linda Blair reflects on the Devil inside in a new interview|date=July 16, 2010}}</ref> Pallenberg was credited as the second unit director and a \"creative associate\".\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''The Heretic'' was Warner's largest day and date launch, opening in 725 theatres in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=725 Get 'Heretic'|date=June 8, 1977|page=3}}</ref> and set an opening weekend record for Warner's<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Biggest Grossing Week-end in Warner Bros.

Reports indicated that the film inspired derisive audience laughter at its premiere in New York City.{{Sfn|Muir|2002|p=475}} William Peter Blatty claimed to have been the first person to start laughing at the theater in which he saw the film, only to be followed by the other patrons (\"You'd think we were watching ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]''\").{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=163}} William Friedkin, director of ''The Exorcist'', recalled hearing a story in which angry audience members at ''Exorcist II'''s first public performance began chasing Warner Bros. executives down the street within the first ten minutes of the screening.<ref>Interview with William Friedkin at the Chicago Critics Film Festival, April 14, 2013.</ref> Friedkin saw half an hour of the film: \"I was at Technicolor and a guy said 'We just finished a print of ''Exorcist II'', do you wanna have a look at it?' And I looked at half an hour of it and I thought it was as bad as seeing a traffic accident in the street. It was horrible. It's just a stupid mess made by a dumb guy \u2013 John Boorman by name, somebody who should be nameless, but in this case should be named. Scurrilous. A horrible picture\".{{Sfn|McCabe|2000|p=165}} Friedkin later said that this sequel diminished the value of the original and called it \"the worst piece of crap I've ever seen\" and \"a freaking disgrace\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464836/original-exorcist-director-says-the-sequel-was-the-worst-movie-hes-ever-seen|title=Original Exorcist Director Says The Sequel Was The Worst Movie He's Ever Seen |publisher=CinemaBlend|date=January 9, 2019|access-date=January 20, 2019|last=Libbey|first=Dirk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blastr.com/2013-4-15/exorcist-director-says-sequel-one-worst-films-ive-ever-seen |title= Exorcist director says sequel is 'one of the worst films I've ever seen' |access-date=2013-12-01 |author=Don Kaye |publisher=[[Blastr]]}}</ref> He later added: \"That film was made by a demented mind\".\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"''Exorcist II'' is not as good as ''The Exorcist''.

It took the greatest film ever made and trashed it in a way that was on one level farcically stupid and on another level absolutely unforgivable. Everyone involved in this, apart from Linda Blair, should be ashamed for all eternity\". [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', was similarly dismissive:\n\n<blockquote>Given the huge box-office success of the William Peter Blatty\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2013\u2060\u200a\u2060William Friedkin production of ''The Exorcist'', there had to be a sequel, but did it have to be this desperate concoction, the main thrust of which is that [the] original exorcism wasn't all it was cracked up to be? It's one thing to carry a story further along, but it's another to deny the original, no matter what you thought of it. I thought it was something even less than good, but this new film, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, is of such spectacular fatuousness that it makes the first seem virtually an axiom of screen art.<ref>Canby, Vincent (June&nbsp;18, 1977). \"Film: 'Exorcist II\" The Heretic' Is Heavy Stuff\".
