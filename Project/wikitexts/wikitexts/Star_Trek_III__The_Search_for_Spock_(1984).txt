It is the third film in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, and is the second part of a three-film [[story arc]] that begins with ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' (1982) and concludes with ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' (1986). After the death of [[Spock]] (Nimoy), the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] returns to Earth. When [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) learns that Spock's spirit, or [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Katra|katra]], is held in the mind of Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy]] ([[DeForest Kelley]]), Kirk and company steal the decommissioned USS ''Enterprise'' to return Spock's body to his homeworld. The crew must also contend with hostile [[Klingon]]s led by Kruge ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) who are bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful [[terraforming]] device.\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] commissioned the film after the positive critical and commercial reaction to ''The Wrath of Khan''. Nimoy directed the film, becoming the first ''Star Trek'' cast member to do so. Producer [[Harve Bennett]] wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the ''Enterprise'' to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film's many special effects sequences. Aside from a single day of location shooting, the film was shot entirely on Paramount and ILM soundstages. Composer [[James Horner]] returned to expand his themes from the previous film.\n\n''The Search for Spock'' opened on June 1, 1984. In its first week of release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office, with a total of $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to ''The Search for Spock'' was generally positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast, Nimoy's direction and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. [[Roger Ebert]] called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second ''Star Trek'' films.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Federation [[starship]] {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}} returns to Earth following [[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|a battle with]] the superhuman [[Khan Noonien Singh]], who tried to destroy the ''Enterprise'' by detonating an experimental [[terraforming]] device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral [[James T. Kirk]]'s [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] friend, [[Spock]], whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. Upon arriving at [[Earth Spacedock]], Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]] begins to act strangely and is detained. The commander of [[Starfleet]], Admiral Morrow, visits the ''Enterprise'' and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is instructed not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device.\n\nDavid Marcus ([[Merritt Butrick]])\u2014Kirk's son and a key scientist in Genesis's development\u2014and Lieutenant [[Saavik]] ([[Robin Curtis]]) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel ''Grissom''. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \"protomatter\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge ([[Christopher Lloyd]]), the commander of a [[Klingon]] Bird of Prey, intercepts information about Genesis. Recognizing the device's potential as a weapon, he takes his [[cloaking device|cloaked]] ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the ''Grissom'', and searches the planet for survivors.\n\nSpock's father, [[Sarek]] ([[Mark Lenard]]), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his ''katra'', or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's ''katra'' and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying it. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the USS ''Excelsior'', and steal the ''Enterprise'' from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet to retrieve Spock's body.\n\nOn Genesis, the Klingons capture Marcus, Saavik, and Spock, and before Kruge can interrogate them, their ship signals that the ''Enterprise'' has arrived. Kruge beams back to the Bird of Prey.\n\nIn orbit, the undermanned ''Enterprise'' initially gains the upper hand in battle, but the Klingons return fire and disable the ship. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders that one of the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate the ''Enterprise''{{'s}} [[self-destruct#Use in fiction|self-destruct sequence]], killing the Klingon boarding party while the ''Enterprise'' crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has Kruge [[transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] Kirk's crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a [[lava]] flow. Kirk and his officers take control of the Klingon ship and head to Vulcan.\n\nThere, Spock's ''katra'' is reunited with his body in a dangerous procedure called ''fal-tor-pan''. The ceremony is successful and Spock is resurrected, alive and well, though his memories are fragmented. At Kirk's prompting, Spock recalls he would refer to Kirk as \"Jim\" and recognizes the crew as well. His friends joyfully gather around him.<ref name=\"rioux-257\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Shatner]] as Admiral [[James T.

Lenard had previously played the role in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[Journey to Babel]]\" and the ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"[[Yesteryear (Star Trek: The Animated Series)|Yesteryear]]\". \n[[Merritt Butrick]] reprises his role as [[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#M|David Marcus]], Kirk's son and a scientist who had helped develop the Genesis Device, from ''The Wrath of Khan''.\nLeonard Nimoy, in addition to his directing duties, appears towards the end of the film as [[Spock]], but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found that the most difficult scene to direct was one in which [[Leonard McCoy]] talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only was he in the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: \"It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids.\" Nimoy was thankful that the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes.<ref name=\"dillard-80\" /> The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by [[Carl Steven]], Vadia Potenza, [[Stephen Manley]], and Joe W. Davis. [[Frank Welker]] provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.<ref name=\"okuda\" />\n\nOther roles include [[Robert Hooks]] as Admiral Morrow, the commander of Starfleet; [[James Sikking|James B.

[[John Larroquette]] plays Maltz, a member of Kruge's bridge crew whom Nimoy describes as \"the thoughtful Klingon\".<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> [[Catherine Shirriff]] plays Valkris, Kruge's doomed lover. [[Grace Lee Whitney]], who played [[Janice Rand]] in the original ''Star Trek'' series, made a [[cameo appearance]] (wearing a wig) as \"Woman in Cafeteria\".

Effects cameraman Don Dow reasoned that since the ship was destroyed so quickly it did not make sense to spend a large amount of time building it.<ref name=\"munson-44\"/> The USS ''Grissom'' was named for astronaut [[Gus Grissom|Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom]]; the same model would be used to depict other science vessels in the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nThe ''Excelsior'' was a new design that ILM felt was a better rendition of a [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship\u2014sleeker and more modern than the ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"munson-51\"/> The art department created concept sketches to show to Paramount, and at an art director's urging model maker William George submitted another design, based on what he thought the ''Enterprise'' would look like if designed by the Japanese. Nimoy picked George's angular and simplified take for production.<ref name=\"star trek universe\"/> While in the film, the ''Excelsior'' is supposed to be larger than its predecessor, the physical model was {{convert|12|in|cm}} smaller than the ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"munson-51\"/>\n\nThe Earth Spacedock was a design intended to expand the scope of ''Star Trek''. After approving a small three-dimensional [[maquette]] of the final design, the effects team created an exterior Spacedock model measuring {{convert|6|ft}} tall. Rather than painstakingly wiring thousands of small lights, ILM made the model out of clear Plexiglass and painted it; scratching off the finish created windows,<ref name=\"star trek universe\"/> and an inner core of neon lights illuminated the resulting holes.<ref name=\"lee-63\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=63|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> The inside of the dock was simulated by an additional model, {{convert|20|ft}} long, with a removable center section.<ref name=\"lee-60\"/> The interior illumination was generated by outside fiber optics and 2,000- to 5,000-watt lights.<ref name=\"munson-51\"/>\n\n[[File:S03-The Search for Spock-Bird of Prey decloaks.png|thumb|The Klingon Bird of Prey, its wings downstretched in an attack posture.

George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated on many of the prop designs, creating updated and sleeker versions of the original series communicators and [[List of weapons in Star Trek#Phasers|phasers]]. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation [[tricorder]] was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.<ref name=\"star trek universe\"/>\n\n===Costumes and makeup===\n[[Robert Fletcher (costume designer)|Robert Fletcher]], costume designer for the previous ''Star Trek'' films, was responsible for ''The Search for Spock''{{'}}s wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the [[Starfleet uniforms]] had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes.<ref name=\"anderson-54\">{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|date=January 1987|title=Star Trek III|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=17|issue=3/4|pages=54\u201355|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness.<ref name=\"anderson-58\">{{cite journal|author=Anderson, Kay|date=January 1987|title=Star Trek III|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=17|issue=3/4|pages=58|issn=0145-6032}}</ref> The costumer had the advantage of access to Paramount's store rooms, which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.<ref name=\"anderson-62\"/>\n\nThe designer and production staff were satisfied with the Klingon costume designs inspired by feudal Japanese dress, made by Fletcher for ''The Motion Picture'', but they had to make new versions;<ref name=\"reeves-226\"/> of 12 original costumes, half had been destroyed during publicity tours. The remaining six were loaned out for an episode of ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' and badly damaged; Fletcher spent three months salvaging what remained.<ref name=\"anderson-58\"/> Additions to established clothing included an officer's vest for Kruge, and jewelry.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nIn addition to his costume chores, Fletcher designed the Klingon and Vulcan makeup. Makeup artist [[Thomas R. Burman]] suggested that Fletcher was asked to help because the studio neglected to contract the work out; Burman received a contract only three weeks before the start of photography. Burman's bid of $160,000 was much higher than Paramount's $50,000 budget, but he secured the job when his competitor dropped out close to the start of production. \"It didn't come down to money in the end but to who could do it quickly [...] we had a [reputation] for working fast and doing quality work,\" Burman explained.<ref name=\"anderson-60\"/> Fletcher and Burman agreed that the cragged foreheads of the Klingons in ''The Motion Picture'' were too prominent, obscuring the individuals' faces. \"It was just too cartoonish, and I didn't want a ''Star Wars'' look in [the] movie. There had never been a good marriage between the forehead appliance and the actor's faces. We tried to keep them in character rather than have these obtrusive things on their heads,\" Burman said. The resulting Klingon makeup took two hours to apply.<ref name=\"anderson-60\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nTo guard against leaks that had prefigured Spock's death during production of ''The Wrath of Khan'',{{#tag:ref|In early drafts of ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s script, Spock's death was intended to be a shocking twist in the first third of the film (\u00e0 la [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''), but leaked word resulted in an angry fan letter-writing campaign.

The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of [[Film speed|exposure indexes]]. Since ''The Search for Spock'' was shot with [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm prints]], Correll needed to produce a crisp [[depth of field]], a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50&nbsp;[[foot-candle]]s.<ref name=\"fisher-38\"/>\n\nMany of ''The Search for Spock''{{'}}s dialogue sequences feature tight close-up shots. During Kirk and Sarek's mind meld, Nimoy chose cuts that focused on accentuating the dialogue; \"Instead of watching people's faces, all you see is the mouth or the eyes and you have the tendency to hear better,\" Correll explained.<ref name=\"lee-60\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=60|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> Correll was unhappy that every scene save one was filmed on a soundstage.

He preferred to treat these as actual locations inside the ships; although the sets' ceilings were designed to be removed so that lights could be rigged in the rafters, Correll used other lighting methods. In the Bird of Prey, he used fluorescent tubes to pick up the walls' metallic paints, and kept the set smoky to convey a dirty atmosphere.<ref name=\"lee-62\"/>\n\nBefore McCoy is arrested by security, he attempts to charter a spaceflight to Genesis in a bar. The scene opens with two officers playing a [[World War I]]-era dogfight video game. The wireframe biplanes were created using black lines on clear paper printouts placed on an overlay cell. \"It was really just a gag shot\", effects artist Charlie Mullen explained, \"the idea that people in the future would be playing an old war game.\"<ref name=\"munson-60\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=60|issn=0198-1056}}</ref> To accommodate the effect, Correll had to use a large amount of exposure without making the bar appear overlit. Much of the lighting was provided by tables rigged with fluorescent tubes to provide an effect different from other parts of the film. Correll could not add smoke to the scene to enhance the bar \"feel\", because the disturbed atmosphere would have made ILM's game hard to insert. The scene was intended to end in a barroom brawl when security tried to take McCoy into custody; Nimoy decided that \"it didn't feel right\" and there was not enough time or money to achieve the scene successfully.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/>\n\nThe Genesis planet was produced via matte paintings and soundstages on Paramount lots under art director [[John Edward Chilberg II]]. Much of the planet occupied Stage 15, known as the [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille stage]] in honor of the director's [[Crossing the Red Sea|Parting of the Red Sea]] on the stage during filming of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''&nbsp;(1956).

The hundreds of 10,000-watt lights in the rafters were covered in silk for day scenes to soften the light, and fitted with blue filters for night; dimmers eased the transition between periods. Since the doomed planet was no longer a paradise, the art director, Nimoy, Bennett and Correll considered constant changes to the colors on the scenes, but decided not to get \"fancy photographically\".<ref name=\"lee-56\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=56|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> While many of the scenes appeared lit with minimal light sources such as flickering fires, Correll tried to use as much light as possible.

The creatures start as small, slimy crawlers, then grow to lengths of {{convert|8|ft}}. The small worms were created by injecting molten \"Hot-Melt\" vinyl into [[epoxy]] polymer molds that were immediately put into cold water to create a translucent product. The resulting hundred or so creatures were painted and coated with methacyl,<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref name=\"munson-55\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=55|issn=0198-1056}}</ref> a slippery, slimy coating. Each worm was attached to an elevated platform by a piece of fishing line; the lines were tied to rods underneath the set. Offscreen helpers pushed the rods or pulled fishing line to create motion; the scene required many takes because the fishing line would periodically flash at the camera. The larger worms proved more problematic, with filming taking place at ILM and Paramount Stage 15. Similar to ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s parasitic Ceti eels, the worms featured cobra-like cowls and a ringed mouth of teeth. ILM built one of the worms with more articulation than the others; Ralston operated the creature through a hole in the set floor with his hand stuck inside the creature. The other worms were animated using [[pneumatic bladder]]s that caused air to pass through hoses in sequence, creating an undulating motion. During the scene, the worms attack Kruge, who kills one of them. The usual method for achieving the effect of the creature wrapping itself around Kruge would have been to film the sequence in reverse, but this posed problems: the slime coating Kruge would have been out of place with reverse filming, and multiple takes would ruin the Klingon makeup Lloyd wore. ILM's solution involved rigging the worm with fishing lines that were pulled in a choreographed fashion by multiple off-screen helpers to simulate the wrapping movement.<ref name=\"munson-55\"/> When small pieces of the Klingon uniforms caught or snapped the fishing lines, Ralston resorted to steel cables.<ref name=\"munson-56\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=56|issn=0198-1056}}</ref>\n\nThe fiery breakup of the Genesis planet involved fire, smoke, and earth upheaval. \"The main part of the floor was rigged so that rocks would shoot up out of the ground [on catapults]. Trees were rigged to fall and start fires,\" Correll explained. Producing the shots required meticulous direction and between 20 and 30&nbsp;helpers were on hand the day of shooting.<ref name=\"lee-56\"/> Correll shot simultaneously on nine cameras; the hope was to get as many usable shots as possible in one take, in case all the trapdoors and pyrotechnics had to be reset for another round of filming. This entire sequence was completed in three weeks.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/>\n\nThe Vulcan stairs were filmed at [[Occidental College]]\u2014the production's only location shooting.<ref name=\"captain's log\"/> To create the orange atmosphere, Correll used a large {{convert|15|by|15|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} floodlight, created for the 1983 [[Peter Hyams]] film ''[[The Star Chamber]]'', placed on the top of a {{convert|110|ft|sp=us|adj=on}} crane.

Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes in the side of the building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.<ref name=\"captain's log\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\nAs with previous ''Star Trek'' films, time and money were major constraints for special effects. The effects artists were concerned about producing the right look no matter the time involved. While effects cameraman [[Scott Farrar]] and his assistants constantly traversed the {{convert|400|mi}} separating ILM from Paramount, teams at the effects house organized post-production effects and photography. The constant travel took a toll on Ralston, who began to forget which airlines he was taking and what city he was in. As a pause in work meant wasted time, effects editors Bill Kimberlin and Jay Ignaszewski produced usable effects shots for the live-action editors at Paramount; these half-finished, monochromatic composites gave the editors an idea of scene pacing.<ref name=\"munson-44\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=44|issn=0198-1056}}</ref> ILM contributed 120&nbsp;shots to the film.<ref name=\"anderson-62\"/><ref name=\"fisher-38\">Fisher, 38.</ref> Like Correll, Ralston used Eastman&nbsp;94 for all shots that did not require [[Chroma key|bluescreen]].<ref name=\"lee-59\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=59|issn=0002-7928}}</ref>\n\nILM filmed starships using [[motion control]] for timed and computer-assisted model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because different parts of the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The ''Excelsior'' required eight passes to supplement the main \"beauty pass\", the ''Enterprise'' six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; \"If anything got out of synch, or somehow we dropped a frame, we would have to reshoot\u2014and then you're stuck. You've ruined two pieces, two elements,\" Farrar said.<ref name=\"munson-51\"/>\n\nThe Klingon Bird of Prey's [[cloaking device]] required a new effect. The original concept featured the layers of the ship forming up from the inside out, requiring a series of overlaid elements filmed with an Oxberry animation camera. ILM decided the effect appeared too \"animated-looking\", and defied common sense: \"if there was a fanfare to decloaking, everyone would know the Klingons were coming and blow them out of the sky before they could even finish materializing,\" Ralston said. The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing [[Color printing#Color separation process|color separations]] out of sync to create a blurry ripple effect. While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=\"munson-44\"/> Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.<ref name=\"munson-47\"/>\n\nThe most laborious effects sequences took place inside Spacedock; months were spent completing the station's interior shots. The effects crew tested different looks to make sure the dock interior seemed appropriately vast. \"We found the interior demanded some degree of atmospheric haze, even though there probably wouldn't be any in space,\" Farrar said. To create a slightly degraded look, the crew used blue [[color gel]]s for lights and shot through smoke for [[Fill light|fill]] shots. They switched to diffusion filters for light passes, as using smoke for longer shots would have required time-consuming smoke level monitoring. Due to difference in the scales of the dock and ship models, it was impossible to film the ''Excelsior'' and ''Enterprise'' inside the set.<ref name=\"munson-48\"/> Opening the dock's space doors was problematic because the lights illuminating the inside of the dock from the exterior had to be hidden from the camera to prevent [[lens flare]]s. Massive fans were used to keep equipment cool and prevent the lights from melting or warping the dock's interior artwork. The realism of the dock scenes was heightened by live action footage of a cafeteria, with windows overlooking the dock interior.<ref name=\"munson-51\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=51|issn=0198-1056}}.</ref> The cafeteria was a set built at ILM and filled with 40&nbsp;extras in front of a bluescreen so that the dock and ''Enterprise'' could be composited in later; matte paintings extended the ceiling of the set.<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref name=\"munson-52\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=52|issn=0198-1056}}</ref>\n\n[[File:S03-The Search For Spock-Enterprise destructs.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16|220px|The ''Enterprise'' destruction sequence combined footage culled from multiple models, since destroying the original would have been very costly.|alt=Video of the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Enterprise<nowiki>''</nowiki> destruction. The first shot shows the domed bridge of the ship explode. Large explosions eat away at the flat saucer section, revealing burning decks. The front portion of the saucer violently explodes, and the rest of the damaged ship lurches forward.]]\nRalston, who considered the ''Enterprise'' ugly and the model hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston would have preferred to take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity)<ref name=\"star trek universe\"/> were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by [[acetone]] dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print.<ref name=\"lee-61\"/> Burning steel wool on the inside of the saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed.<ref name=\"anderson-62\"/> The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a [[Baby powder|talcum powder]]-covered plaster dish.<ref name=\"lee-61\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=61|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> Two- and four-ounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.<ref name=\"anderson-75\"/>\n\nFor the final destruction of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage.<ref name=\"munson-60\"/> ILM built scale miniatures<ref name=\"okuda\"/> cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis's upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate.<ref name=\"anderson-75\"/> One of the largest miniatures, measuring {{convert|20|by|16|ft}}, had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and [[solenoid]]-triggered rockfalls.<ref name=\"munson-60\"/> For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting.<ref name=\"lee-57\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=57|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, [[vermiculite]] and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, with the help of a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lightning flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance.<ref name=\"lee-58\">{{cite journal|author=Lee, Nora|date=August 1984|title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|journal=[[American Cinematographer]]|volume=65|issue=8|pages=58|issn=0002-7928}}</ref> Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time.<ref name=\"munson-59\">{{cite journal|author=Munson, Brad|date=August 1984|title=The Last Voyage of the Starship 'Enterprise'|journal=[[Cinefex]]|volume=1|issue=18|pages=59|issn=0198-1056}}</ref> The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live-action crew.<ref name=\"lee-57\"/>\n\nAmong the other effects ILM had to produce were the transporter beam and the warp speed effect. Mullen noted that the effects' look changed depending on who was directing the film; \"everyone wants something distinctive, but nobody wants to get far enough away from the TV series to startle the [[Trekkie]]s\". The effect was produced by cutting out or [[Rotoscoping|rotomatting]] the individual to be transported, then making a vertical slot through which a high-intensity light was positioned. A computer-controlled move would cause the light to spread from the center and fade away, then reset its position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Handmade acetate filters and gels were applied to give the transporter beam color and patterns, followed by small flickering animated highlights called \"bugs\" which appeared after the character had dematerialized.<ref name=\"munson-56\"/> The Klingons' transporters were given a harsh red look to differentiate them from the smooth blue Federation effect. Whereas many of the multicolored rainbow warp trail shots from ''The Wrath of Khan'' were stock footage taken from the first film, the producers of the third film wanted something new. A streak effect, in which a beauty pass of the ship was combined with blurred passes for each light intensity, was tried first. The result was disappointing; as the ''Enterprise'' grew larger the streaks became distorted and out of place. Mullen rejected a straight animation of the warp drive as too bouncy, but the footage was cut in for editing while ILM went through six more approaches to the problem. The final effect, a \"vaporous, colorful trail\", came together only weeks before the film's release.<ref name=\"munson-59\"/>\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[James Horner]] returned to score ''The Search for Spock'', fulfilling a promise he had made to Bennett on ''The Wrath of Khan''.<ref name=\"cinemascore-simak\"/> While Nimoy considered hiring his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]] for the score, he was persuaded that Horner's return would grant continuity between ''The Wrath of Khan'' and the new film.<ref name=\"bond2010-7\">{{cite AV media notes |title= Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|others=[[James Horner]] |year= 2010|first=Jeff|last=Bond|author2=Lukas Kendall |pages=7 |type=Compact Disc |publisher=Retrograde Records}}</ref> Much like the content of the film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film.
