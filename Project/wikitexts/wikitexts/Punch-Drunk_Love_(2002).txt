It follows an entrepreneur with social anxiety who falls in love with his sister's co-worker.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[New Line Cinema]], and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It features the video art of [[Jeremy Blake]] in the form of visual interludes. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Sandler's performance receiving widespread acclaim. However, the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], failing to recoup its $25 million production budget at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nBarry Egan is a bachelor who owns a company that markets themed toilet plungers and other novelty items. He has seven overbearing sisters who regularly ridicule and emotionally abuse him, so he leads a lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and social anxiety. One day, he witnesses an inexplicable car accident, picks up an abandoned [[pump organ|harmonium]] from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard (a coworker of Elizabeth, one of his sisters). Lena had orchestrated the meeting after seeing him in Elizabeth's family picture at work.\n\nBarry goes to his sister's birthday party, where they tease him about his sexuality, leading to a serious outburst in which he breaks his sister's sliding glass door. Afterwards, he asks his brother-in-law to refer him to a therapist. Instead, Barry calls a [[phone sex line]] to cope with his loneliness. The phone sex operator tries to extort money from him and then sends four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a [[Healthy Choice]] promotion and amass a million [[Frequent flyer program|frequent-flyer miles]] by purchasing large quantities of pudding.\n\nWhen Lena leaves for [[Hawaii]] on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her, using his sister to find Lena, who is overjoyed to see him. As the two spend time together, Barry's sister calls Lena, complicating matters, but Lena lies about having contact with Barry. The romance develops further, leading to Barry's relief from his emotional isolation.\n\nOn the return trip, the four brothers ram Barry's car, mildly injuring Lena. After fighting all four brothers off with a [[tire iron]], Barry leaves Lena at the hospital and sets out to end the harassment. He calls the phone-sex line back and finds out the \"supervisor\" is the owner of a mattress store. Barry drives all the way to [[Provo, Utah]], to confront the owner, Dean, face to face. At first, trying to intimidate Barry, Dean finds him more intimidating once he learns that Barry has come all the way from California. They both agree \"that's that\".\n\nBarry returns home and goes to see Lena to explain why the accident happened. He begs for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flier miles to accompany her on all future business trips after his pudding miles are processed.  Lena confesses she was more upset at being left at the hospital but forgives him and they embrace happily.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Barry Egan, an unmarried entrepreneur with social anxiety\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Lena Leonard, Barry's love interest and Elizabeth's friend and coworker\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Dean Trumbell, the owner of the mattress store\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Elizabeth Egan, Barry's overbearing sister\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Lance, Barry's coworker\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Walter, a dentist and Barry's brother-in-law\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sandler-Anderson-Watson-Hoffman(Cannes2002).jpg|thumb|right|(L to R) [[Adam Sandler]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Emily Watson]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival]]\nAfter the success of ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), writer-director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] stated that he was determined to make his next film ninety minutes long, and stated that he wanted to cast [[Adam Sandler]] in a future film.<ref name=\"patterson\">{{cite news |last=Patterson |first=John |date=March 10, 2000 |title=''Magnolia'' Maniac |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features |access-date=April 12, 2010 |archive-date=August 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827044550/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features |url-status=live }}</ref> After establishing his style with his previous films, he wanted to challenge himself within the parameters of a ninety-minute-long romantic comedy.<ref name=\"CrazyLA\">{{Cite web |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |date=May 20, 2002 |title=Crazy for Love |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-may-20-et-turan20-story.html |access-date=April 25, 2022 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Anderson is a fan of Sandler's films, describing his love for his movies as \"obsession-level,\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barfield |first=Charles |date=May 3, 2018 |title=Throwback Thursday: Paul Thomas Anderson Has An \"Obsession\" With Adam Sandler\u2019s \u2018Big Daddy\u2019 |url=https://theplaylist.net/tbt-paul-thomas-anderson-sandler-20180503/ |access-date=April 13, 2022 |website=The Playlist}}</ref><ref name=\"EbertInterview\" /> and was determined to make a film with Sandler as a lead, saying, \"He's always just made me laugh, he gets me, I wanted a piece of him.\"<ref name=\"CrazyLA\" /> He specifically wrote ''Punch-Drunk Love'' with Sandler and [[Emily Watson]] in mind.

It has behind-the-scenes featurette about a recording session for the film's soundtrack, a Cannes press conference and deleted scenes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punch-Drunk Love |website=The Criterion Collection |url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27916-punch-drunk-love |access-date=2018-10-11 |archive-date=2018-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011214613/https://www.criterion.com/films/27916-punch-drunk-love |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Punch-Drunk Love (soundtrack)}}\nThe score to ''Punch-Drunk Love'' was composed by [[Jon Brion]]. As with ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', Brion and Anderson collaborated heavily for the production of the film's score. However, rather than scoring the film after rough footage had been shot, Brion made compositions while making the film. During the scoring process, Brion would experiment with tones and sounds, carefully making note of what Anderson would respond to. Anderson himself would create the vocal tempos he would envision in the score and use them on set, even to the extent of inspiring the pace of Sandler's performance.\n\nThe film's score features heavy use of the [[harmonium]]. Brion had introduced Anderson to it on ''Magnolia'', and Anderson knew he wanted it to feature heavily in the score.<ref>Chapman, Glen (February 21, 2011).

Retrieved January 24, 2016.</ref> Many scenes between Sandler's character and the instrument were inspired by Brion. For instance, Brion once found a harmonium with a hole in its bellows before going on tour with [[Aimee Mann]]. To fix the problem, he covered the hole with duct tape. The situation is mirrored in the film.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"TheNumbers\">{{cite web |title=Punch-Drunk Love |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Punch-Drunk-Love |access-date=March 8, 2015 |quote=Production Budget: $25,000,000 |archive-date=July 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711174902/https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Punch-Drunk-Love |url-status=live }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q580716|c=Category:Punch-Drunk Love|wikt=no|s=no|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no}}\n* {{IMDb title|0272338}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|punchdrunk_love}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Punch-Drunk_Love.html Early draft screenplay  for ''Punch-Drunk Love''] from dailyscript.com\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4302-punch-drunk-love-a-delegate-speaks ''Punch-Drunk Love: A Delegate Speaks''] an essay by [[Miranda July]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Paul Thomas Anderson}}\n{{Mark Kermode's Best Film of the Year}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Punch-Drunk Love}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jon Brion]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Thomas Anderson]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Revolution Studios films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the San Fernando Valley]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
