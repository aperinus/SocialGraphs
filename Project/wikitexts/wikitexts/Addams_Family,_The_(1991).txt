The film focuses on a bizarre, macabre, aristocratic family who reconnect with what they believe to be a long-lost relative, Gomez's brother Fester Addams.\n\nThe film was noted for its troubled production; originally developed at [[Orion Pictures|Orion]], the film went $5&nbsp;million over budget due to constant rewrites throughout shooting; health problems of people involved in the filming and an overall stressful filming for Sonnenfeld himself, which caused multiple delays. The rise in production costs from the film's $25&nbsp;million budget to $30&nbsp;million led Orion,  financially struggling and fearful of another big-budget flop, to sell the film to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who completed the film and handled the film's domestic distribution, while Orion distributed the film internationally. The film was commercially successful, making back several times its production costs, and was followed by a sequel, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', two years later.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gomez Addams]] laments the 25-year absence of his brother [[Fester Addams|Fester]], who disappeared after the two had a falling-out. Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark/[[confidence trick|con artist]] Abigail Craven, and notices that her adopted son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a [[s\u00e9ance]] at the Addams home led by [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as a German psychiatrist named Dr. Greta Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] for the past 25 years until she found him in some tuna nets.\n\nGomez, overjoyed to have \"Fester\" back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the [[conjoined twins]] Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \"Fester\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife [[Morticia Addams|Morticia]] reminds \"Fester\" of the importance of family among the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]].\n\nGordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] and [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]], whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. Abigail had insisted that Gordon not attend the play, but after feeling deeply saddened by this, he attends anyway. After the play, Dr. Pinder-Schloss insists that \"Fester\" must once again leave, so the Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault. Wednesday overhears Abigail and Gordon discussing the plan, and escapes them by hiding in the family cemetery. Tully learns that as the elder brother, Fester is the executor of the Addams estate and therefore technically owns the entire property. With help from the Addamses' neighbor Judge George Womack, whom Gomez has repeatedly infuriated by hitting golf balls into his house, Tully procures a [[restraining order]] against the family, banning them from the estate. Gomez attempts to fight the order in court, but Judge Womack rules against him out of spite.\n\nWhile Abigail, Gordon, and Tully try repeatedly and unsuccessfully to get past the booby trap blocking access to the vault, the Addamses are forced to move into a motel and find jobs. Morticia tries to be a preschool teacher, Wednesday and Pugsley sell toxic lemonade, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]\u2014the family's animated disembodied hand\u2014becomes a courier. Despondent, Gomez sinks into depression and lethargy.\n\nMorticia returns to the Addams home to confront Gordon and is captured by Abigail and Tully, who torture her in an attempt to learn how to access the vault. Thing observes this and informs Gomez, using [[Morse code]], who then rushes to Morticia's rescue. Abigail threatens Morticia's life if Gomez does not surrender the family fortune. Fed up with his mother's behavior and constant berating, Gordon turns against her. Using a magical book which projects its contents into reality, he unleashes a hurricane into the house, which strikes his own head with lightning and launches Tully and Abigail out of a window and into open graves dug for them by Wednesday and Pugsley.\n\nThe movie ends with a coda, taking place seven months later at [[Halloween]]. The family states that Gordon was really Fester all along, and that the previously made-up story about Fester being found in the tuna nets after being lost in the Bermuda Triangle is true. They further state that Fester had suffered from [[amnesia]] the whole time and only recovered his memories after being struck by lightning. With the family whole again as they play \"Wake the Dead\", Morticia informs Gomez that [[Addams Family Values|she is pregnant]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Morticia Addams]]\n* [[Raul Julia]] as [[Gomez Addams]]\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as [[Uncle Fester|Uncle Fester Addams / Gordon Craven]]\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as [[Wednesday Addams]]\n* [[Jimmy Workman]] as [[Pugsley Addams]]\n* [[Judith Malina]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]]\n* [[Carel Struycken]] as [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]\n* [[Christopher Hart (actor)|Christopher Hart]] as [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]\n* [[John Franklin (actor)|John Franklin]] as [[Cousin Itt]]\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Abigail Craven\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Tully Alford\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Margaret Alford\n* [[Paul Benedict]] as Judge George Womack\n* [[Mercedes McNab]] as Girl Scout\n* [[Sally Jessy Raphael]] as Herself\n\n[[Barry Sonnenfeld]] makes an uncredited cameo as a passenger on Gomez's train.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[Scott Rudin]], a development executive at [[20th Century Fox]], pitched to the studio an adaptation of [[Charles Addams]]' ''[[The Addams Family]]'' cartoons, and the studio enthusiastically agreed that the cartoons would make a good film, and set out to purchase the rights. However, Fox would ultimately not make the film, as [[Orion Pictures]], who owned the film rights to ''The Addams Family'', would not sell the property, as they were planning on producing a rebooted TV series. Further crucial property rights were owned by Charles Addams' widow.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\" /> Another difficulty in getting the film produced was the relative obscurity of [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'' 1964 TV series]], as compared to the better-known (due to syndication) series, ''[[The Munsters]]''. The production finally moved forward when Addams' widow sold the remaining rights to Orion, who put the film in production with Rudin producing.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Anjelica Huston]] said she based aspects of her performance on her friend [[Jerry Hall]] to give the character more warmth.

Filming resumed, but within weeks Tattersall was rushed to the hospital, halting production while Sonnenfeld took over cinematography, while simultaneously directing the film.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\" /> Further delays occurred when a blood vessel in actor [[Raul Julia]]'s eye burst, leading the production to film around Julia until he recovered, and Sonnenfeld's wife became sick, halting production.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\" />\n\nIn her 2014 memoir ''Watch Me'', Anjelica Huston described the filming of the ''Addams Family'' as \"long and arduous\".<ref name=\"Huston\" /> It was decided that the character of Morticia should have eyes which slanted upwards at the sides, an effect which was achieved by attaching an elastic strap to the back of Huston's head via fabric tabs glued at her temples, which pulled the corners of her eyes upwards.<ref name=\"Huston\">{{cite book |title=Watch Me |url=https://archive.org/details/watchmememoir0000hust |url-access=registration |first=Anjelica |last=Huston| publisher=Scribner's |year=2014 |page=[https://archive.org/details/watchmememoir0000hust/page/241 241-242]|isbn=9781476760346}}</ref> A second strap was added to balance the appearance of the lower part of her face with the upper. The bands caused extended discomfort to Huston, and, unless she removed them at lunchtime, she would suffer severe headaches and rashes later in the day. Removing the bands for a break entailed hours of extra work in both removing and then re-applying her makeup and wig. On top of this, the bands would snap at the slightest turn of Huston's head, causing yet more grueling repair time. Eventually, she learned to pivot and turn on her feet without moving her upper body or head.<ref name=\"Huston\" /> According to Huston, actress Judith Malina's way of enduring being \"embedded in latex for over twelve hours a day\" was to \"smoke an endless series of [[Joint (cannabis)|joints]] in her trailer throughout filming\".<ref name=\"Huston\" />\n\nAnother production difficulty was the financial decline of original production studio Orion Pictures, who, while having recently made the big hits ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', had also produced several major flops which ate up the studios' funds, leading Orion to sell ''The Addams Family'', while still in production, to [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{cite web |last=Brew |first=Simon |date=September 29, 2014 |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/addams-family/32261/the-huge-behind-the-scenes-problems-on-the-addams-family |title=The huge behind the scenes problems on The Addams Family |work=Den of Geek! |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |access-date=April 12, 2019 |archive-date=April 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412125926/https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/addams-family/32261/the-huge-behind-the-scenes-problems-on-the-addams-family |url-status=live}}</ref> In exchange, Paramount would own the domestic rights, as Orion had pre-sold the foreign rights to [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]].<ref name=\"addamsony\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58747|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2020-02-03|archive-date=2020-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921132136/http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58747|url-status=live}}</ref> Part of Orion's motivation to sell the film was that the film, originally budgeted at $25&nbsp;million, had gone $5&nbsp;million over budget due to newly added material as a result of the film's numerous rewrites. With the projected release date competing with [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', Orion feared that ''The Addams Family'' would be another expensive flop, and decided to cut its losses. Ultimately, ''The Addams Family'' was a box-office hit. As the sale occurred late in production, the filmmakers were unaware that Paramount had taken over production, learning of the sale from a journalist rather than either of the studios.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nThe film was further shaped by test screenings.
