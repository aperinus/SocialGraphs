The film stars [[Kristy Swanson]] as a \"peasant girl\" named Jessie who is enchanted by an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]'s magic necklace, freezing her in the form of a wooden mannequin. She is to remain frozen for one thousand years, or until the necklace is removed by the person who will be her true love. In modern day Philadelphia, she is freed by Jason Williamson ([[William Ragsdale]]), a new employee of the Prince & Company department store and the descendant of Jesse's original love. The two fall in love while avoiding Count Spretzle ([[Terry Kiser]]), the descendant of the evil sorcerer.\n\nThe original film's theme song \"[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]\" by [[Starship (band)|Starship]], written by [[Diane Warren]] and [[Albert Hammond]], was featured in this film. The original music score was composed by David McHugh. Though the sequel takes place in the same Philadelphia department store Prince & Company as the original film, only actors [[Meshach Taylor|Mesach Taylor]] and Andrew Hill Newman returned from the original film. While Taylor reprises the role of Hollywood Montrose and briefly references having witnessed a similar romance during the first film, it is unclear if Newman plays the same character as he did in the first film or is portraying a new character.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1391, Prince William of the small Germanic kingdom of Hauptmann-Koenig falls in love with a peasant girl named Jessie. Not approving of the romance, the queen plots with her court sorcerer Spretzel, who enchants a necklace intended for Jessie. Putting on the necklace, she is transformed into a wooden statue and the magic prevents William from freeing her. He is told Jessie will be frozen for a thousand years and can only wake earlier if a true love from another land removes the necklace. Angry, William declares the kingdom will then also be cursed for a thousand years. Perpetual rainfall begins.\n\n\"Almost\" one thousand years later, Hauptmann-Koenig is a poor country enduring endless rain and financial hardship. Jessie stands as a museum piece in the castle, where a tour guide recites the fairy tale of the \"Enchanted Peasant Girl.\" To boost tourism, Count Gunther Spretzle sends the statue to be displayed at the Prince & Company department store in [[Philadelphia]]. The store will do a dramatic stage presentation celebrating the Hauptman-Koenig's history and culture. Secretly, Count Spretzle is the descendant of the sorcerer and knows the fairy tale is true. When Jessie awakens in a few days, he plans to make her his bride and then escape to Bermuda with his henchmen, using stolen crown jewels to fund his retirement.\n\nIn the [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown section of Northwest Philadelphia]], Jason Williamson, a descendant of Prince William, lives with his mother who runs a matchmaking service. He begins work at Prince & Company where store manager Mr. James makes him assistant to visual merchandising head Hollywood Montrose, who is directing the Enchanted Peasant Girl presentation. When the delivery truck with the Hauptmann-Koenig artifacts crashes over the Schuylkill River, Hollywood and James arrive on the scene. Seeing a female figure falls into the river, Jason saves her, only then realizing it's the statue from Europe. Jessie is briefly restored to life when Jason touches her necklace.\n\nBack at Prince & Company, Jason is romantically drawn to Jessie. Removing her necklace with ease, he is shocked when she comes to life. Learning she is in the future, Jessie concludes Jason is William reincarnated. Jason shows Jessie the modern world and they have a whirlwind romance, sharing their feelings, dreams, and cultures with each other. The next morning, unaware of its magic, Jessie puts on her necklace and is frozen again. Heartbroken and unsure what to do, Jason returns the statue to Prince & Company.\n\nAdmiring Jessie's necklace, Hollywood tries it on, becoming a statue and restoring her to life. Jessie leaves to explore the mall. Spretzle's henchmen find Hollywood, remove the necklace, then rush to find Jessie. The Queen of Hauptman-Koenig then calls Spretzle, warning him she knows the crown jewels are missing. Jason finds Hollywood and explains Jessie came to life. Hollywood believes him, remarking, [[Mannequin (1987 film)|\"This has happened before.\"]]\n\nRecognizing Jason is William reincarnated, Spretzel tries to kill him.  Seeing Spretzel's henchmen, Jessie takes a go-kart and escapes to Jason's home.  Spretzle and the authorities follow Jason to his home.  The count confronts Jessie alone and puts the necklace on her.  Seeing her frozen again, Jason realizes the necklace is cursed and demands it be removed.  The cops (Hollywood calls them \"The Heat\"), believing he is unhealthily fixated on a mannequin, arrest him for theft.  Spretzle wants to leave with Jessie but Mr. James reminds the count they have a contract and a show happening tomorrow.\n\nThe next day, Hollywood dresses in his former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] uniform and bluffs a policeman into releasing Jason into his custody. At the Enchanted Peasant Girl presentation, Jason removes Jessie's necklace on stage, restoring her to life in front of spectators who assume it is part of the show. Enraged, Spretzle takes Jessie and forces her into his hot air balloon. Jason follows and they struggle. Jessie puts the necklace on Spretzle, repeating the ancient curse. The now-frozen Spretzle is knocked out of the balloon and smashes into pieces on the street.\n\nLater in Hauptmann-Koenig, the glued together statue of Count Spretzle is the castle centerpiece and inspires his own fairy tale. Meanwhile, the newly married Jason and Jessie pick up a new necklace at Prince & Company before leaving on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Jessie\n* [[William Ragsdale]] as Jason Williamson/Prince William\n* [[Meshach Taylor]] as Hollywood Montrose/Club Doorman\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as Count Gunther Spretzle/Sorcerer\n* [[Stuart Pankin]] as Mr. James\n* [[Cynthia Harris]] as Mrs. Williamson/Queen\n* Andrew Hill Newman as Andy Ackerman\n* Robert Pilarski as Bob\n\n==Production==\nThe first film had been financially successful and the production company wanted a sequel.
