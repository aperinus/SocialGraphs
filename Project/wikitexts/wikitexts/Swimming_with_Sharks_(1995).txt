Guy, who has just graduated from [[film school]], believes that his new job is a golden opportunity. Despite warnings from Rex (del Toro), the outgoing assistant who has become hardened under Buddy's reign, Guy remains optimistic.\n\nBuddy turns out to be the boss from hell; he treats Guy like a slave, subjects him to [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] (and public) [[verbal abuse]], and has him bending over backward to do meaningless errands that go beyond just his work life. Guy is humiliated and forced to bear the brunt of his insults. His only solace is his new girlfriend Dawn (Forbes), a [[film producer|producer]] at Buddy's firm. When Buddy apparently fires Guy in a phone call, Guy finally snaps and takes Buddy hostage in order to exact revenge. He ties Buddy up and subjects him to severe beatings, torture and [[mind games]]. It is later revealed that due to a botched [[call waiting]] function on Buddy's home phone, Guy heard Buddy and Dawn arranging a rendezvous at Buddy's house.\n\nOnce in Guy's power, Buddy reveals for the first time a human, vulnerable side. He tells Guy that his wife had been raped and murdered on Christmas Eve twelve years prior, and reveals that he, too, was once a bullied assistant to powerful, tyrannical men and spent a decade putting up with such abuse to become successful himself. He also reveals that abusing Guy was his way of teaching Guy that he must earn his success. Dawn arrives at the scene to find Guy aiming a gun at Buddy's face and insists that she had only agreed to see Buddy as a way of helping Guy's career. Dawn pleads with Guy to put down the gun, whereupon Buddy tells Guy that he has to pull the trigger in order to get ahead in the business. After a moment's indecision, Buddy screams at Guy to shoot, which Guy does.\n\nThe climax of the film reveals that Guy killed Dawn (who is blamed for [[kidnapping]] and torturing Buddy) and was subsequently promoted. In the final scene, Guy coldly tells a former colleague to find out what he really wants and then do anything to get it, echoing the numerous times Buddy told Guy. The movie ends with a beaten-up Buddy passing by Guy's office, making eye contact with him and silently gesturing to call him into his office for a meeting. Guy excuses himself and goes into Buddy's office, ignoring his ringing telephone. Buddy shuts his office doors as other employees walk by.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Buddy Ackerman\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Guy\n* [[Michelle Forbes]] as Dawn Lockard\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Rex\n* T.E. Russell as Foster Kane\n* [[Roy Dotrice]] as Cyrus Miles\n* Matthew Flynt as Manny\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Moe\n* [[Jerry Levine]] as Jack\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Background|Development}}\n[[George Huang (director)|George Huang]] decided to write the script after having a conversation with [[Robert Rodriguez]]. Rodriguez was in [[Los Angeles]] after his film ''[[El Mariachi]]'' brought him to the attention of [[Sony Pictures]], where he befriended Huang. Huang told Rodriguez of his frustrations with filmmaking when the director encouraged him to quit his post at Sony and pursue writing full-time so Huang could produce a script to direct himself.\n\nHuang's resultant script, \"Reel Life\", was picked up by [[Cineville]] executive [[Frank Evers (NYPH)|Frank Evers]], who brought in financing from independent investors, and significant production support from Sony Pictures Entertainment. The film was subsequently sold to [[Trimark Pictures]] (later assumed by [[Lionsgate]] in 2000). [[Cineville]] produced the film with [[Carl Colpaert]], chairman of [[Cineville]] and Steve Alexander overseeing production.\n\nAlthough writer George Huang himself worked as an assistant for Barry Josephson, who was the Senior Vice President of Development at Sony Pictures at the time, some have suggested that Buddy's character was inspired by real life movie mogul [[Scott Rudin]], while others suggest he is based on producer [[Joel Silver]] with Guy being based on [[Alan Schechter (film producer)|Alan Schechter]], Silver's assistant in the early 1990s.\n\nThe director Buddy hires in the film, Foster Kane, is named after [[Orson Welles]]' character in the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', [[Charles Foster Kane]].\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 38 critics.
