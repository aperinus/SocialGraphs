It premiered at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 15, 2010, in an out-of-competition slot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/11019455/year/2010.html |title=Cannes Film Festival - Selection List |publisher=Festival-cannes.com |access-date=2010-10-02 |archive-date=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211071958/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/11019455/year/2010.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAlfie and Helena divorce. Helena begins seeing a [[fortune teller]], Cristal, for spiritual advice. Their daughter Sally has a troubled marriage with author Roy, who once wrote a successful book and is now anxiously waiting for a response from his publisher about the manuscript of his newest one. Helena helps pay their rent.\n\nAlfie marries a prostitute, Charmaine. Roy falls for Dia, a musicologist he sees through a window near his and Sally's flat, who is engaged to another man. Sally considers having an affair with Greg, her new boss at an art gallery. Greg confesses he is having trouble at home and eventually it turns out he is having an affair with Iris, Sally's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]]. Helena begins a friendship with Jonathan, the proprietor of an occult bookshop, which develops into romance.\n\nRoy's book is rejected. He hears that Henry, a friend who is also a writer, has died in an accident. Henry had just finished a brilliant manuscript he had shown only to Roy, and Roy decides to steal it and claim it as his work. It is well received. After a string of lunch dates with Dia, he convinces her to break off her engagement (much to the devastation of her fianc\u00e9 and their families) and moves in with her.\n\nAlfie gets into a fight with Charmaine over her high expenses. He asks Helena to make a new start with him, but she refuses. Charmaine has sex with another man and gets pregnant. Alfie wants a DNA test to discover whether he is the father, but Charmaine argues that his paternity is irrelevant.\n\nSally quits her job and asks Helena for a loan she promised, for setting up her own art gallery, but Helena refuses because according to Cristal it is astrologically a bad time. Sally is furious. Roy is informed that there was a mix-up of the people killed in the accident and is shocked to hear that Henry is actually in a coma and recovering.\n\nIn the end, all are dissatisfied with their choices, except for Helena. She has acquired from Cristal a belief in [[reincarnation]] and sees her life now as only one episode in her series of lives. Jonathan shares her beliefs, and they receive his deceased wife's blessing for the new relationship via a [[s\u00e9ance]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Greg Clemente\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Roy Channing\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Alfie Shepridge\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Helena Shepridge\n* [[Freida Pinto]] as Dia\n* [[Lucy Punch]] as Charmaine Foxx\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Sally Channing\n* [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Jonathan Wunch\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Henry Strangler\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as Allen\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Enid Wicklow\n* [[Pauline Collins]] as Cristal D'Argenis\n* [[Anna Friel]] as Iris\n* [[Alex Macqueen]] as Malcolm Dodds\n* [[Meera Syal]] as Dia's mother\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dia's father\n* [[Natalie Walter]] as Allen's sister\n* [[Christian McKay]] as poker friend\n* [[Philip Glenister]] as poker friend\n* [[Theo James]] as Ray Richards\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAllen wrote the script because he was \"interested in the concept of [[faith]] in something. This sounds so bleak when I say it, but we need some [[delusion]]s to keep us going. And the people who successfully delude themselves seem happier than the people who can't. I've known people who have put their faith in religion and in fortune tellers. So it occurred to me that that was a good character for a movie: a woman who everything had failed for her, and all of a sudden, it turned out that a woman telling her fortune was helping her. The problem is, eventually, she's in for a rude awakening.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/movies/15woody.html |title=Woody Allen on Faith, Fortune Tellers and New York |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2010 |access-date=2010-10-29 |archive-date=2010-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916044858/http://www.nytimes.com//2010/09/15/movies/15woody.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film is the fourth Allen film shot in London, following ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005), ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'' (2006), and ''[[Cassandra's Dream]]'' (2007).\n\nOriginally, [[Nicole Kidman]] was cast in one of the lead roles.
