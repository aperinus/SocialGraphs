It is a loose remake of ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'', a 1967 film about a black man marrying a white woman. This film instead focuses on a black woman marrying a white man. The film stars [[Bernie Mac]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], and [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a]].\n\nThe majority of the film was filmed in [[Cranford, New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rennamedia.com/cranford-chosen-for-hbo-mini-series/|title=Renna Media &#124; Cranford Chosen for HBO Series - The Plot Against America|date=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nTheresa Jones takes her boyfriend, Simon Green, to her parents' home to meet them on their 25th wedding anniversary, planning to reveal that the couple are engaged. However, Theresa has neglected to mention that Simon is [[White people|white]]. Theresa's father, Percy, dislikes Simon almost immediately because of his race. Wishing to impress Percy, Simon lies to him about being on the [[NASCAR]] pit crew for [[Jeff Gordon]], not realizing that Percy is one of Gordon's biggest fans. After catching Theresa and Simon in a compromising position, Percy tries to force Simon into a hotel, but all the hotels in town are booked. Instead, Percy allows Simon to sleep in his basement on the couch, where Percy also sleeps.\n\nWith the help of his personal assistant Reggie, Percy tries to learn as much information about Simon as he can as well as creating the ideal black boyfriend for Theresa instead of revealing her boyfriend is white. Reggie manages to convince Simon to reveal that he lied about being a NASCAR pit crew member and also that he needs a $50,000 loan. Simon discovers Percy's lies just as Reggie reveals that Simon quit his job. Immediately, Percy goes to tell Theresa this new information; however, Simon claims he was not fired and instead quit. Furious that he did not tell her the truth, Theresa leaves while Percy's spying and plagiarism of his vows temporarily strains his relationship with his wife, Marilyn.\n\nThe next morning, Percy and Simon find Marilyn and Theresa to apologize. While Marilyn and Percy reconcile, Simon and Theresa break up and he leaves. On the day of his anniversary, Theresa tells her father that she and Simon were intending to marry. After wondering why a man intending to get married would quit his job, Percy realizes that Simon quit his job due to his boss' disapproval of interracial relationships. Percy pursues Simon and brings him back to Theresa, and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Percy Jones\n* [[Judith Scott (American actress)|Judith Scott]] as Marilyn Jones, Percy's wife\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a]] as Theresa Jones, Percy & Marilyn's daughter and Simon's girlfriend\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Simon Green, Theresa's boyfriend\n* [[Hal Williams]] as Howard Jones, Percy's father\n* [[Kellee Stewart]] as Keisha Jones, Percy & Marilyn's daughter\n* [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]] as Joseph Jones\n* [[Sherri Shepherd]] as Sydney\n* [[Robert Curtis Brown]] as Dante\n* [[RonReaco Lee]] as Reggie\n* [[Phil Reeves]] as Fred\n* [[Nicole Sullivan]] as Liz Klein\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Polly\n* [[Niecy Nash]] as Naomi\n* [[Kimberly Scott]] as Kimdra\n* [[Denise Dowse]] as Lisa\n* [[Richard Lawson (actor)|Richard Lawson]] as Marcus\n\n== Production ==\nThe film's working title was ''The Dinner Party''.
