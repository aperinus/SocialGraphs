[[Joseph Mortimer Granville|Dr. Mortimer Granville]] ([[Hugh Dancy]]) is a young physician who has difficulty with his occupation due to constant arguments over modern medicine. He gets a job assisting Dr. Dalrymple ([[Jonathan Pryce]]), whose practice specializes in the treatment of \"hysteria\", a popular diagnosis for women of that time. [[Medical practitioner]]s like Dr. Dalrymple tried to manage hysteria by massaging the genital area, decently covered under a curtain, to elicit \"[[paroxysm]]al convulsions\", without recognizing that they were inducing [[orgasm]]s. Granville meets Dr. Dalrymple's daughters, Emily ([[Felicity Jones]]), and her older sister Charlotte ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a [[suffragette|premodern feminist]] who runs a [[settlement movement|settlement house]] in a poor section of London.\n\nGranville seems to be good at massaging, getting a sizeable following, while at the same time Dr. Dalrymple suggests he might eventually take over the business and marry Emily. One night after work, Charlotte comes in with her friend Fannie ([[Ashley Jensen]]), who has broken her ankle. After he helps treat her, Dalrymple forbids Granville from offering any future assistance to Charlotte, hoping to dissuade her from her work in the slums. Meanwhile, the increased clientele at the practice is hard on Granville, and his hand musculature is unable to keep up with the task; an attack of cramp results in his dismissal. Fortunately, his friend, Lord Edmund St. John-Smythe ([[Rupert Everett]]), has developed an electrical [[feather duster]], and its vibrations give Dr. Granville the idea of modifying the gadget for use as an electric massager. After successfully using it on the Dalrymple's maid Molly ([[Sheridan Smith]]), he persuades Dr. Dalrymple to try the device on his patients, resulting in massive success. Mortimer and Emily then become engaged, while Charlotte struggles with supporting the welfare house.\n\nAt the engagement party, Charlotte is arrested while protecting Fannie from a police officer. Emily and Dr. Dalrymple urge Granville to testify at her trial that she is hysterical in order to prevent her from being sent to prison. During the trial, the prosecutor recommends that Charlotte be sent to a sanatorium and be forced to undergo a [[hysterectomy]]. As Mortimer speaks, he explains that the symptoms for hysteria are too common to be regarded as a mental illness, and that he himself believes that Charlotte is the most generous and caring person he knows. The judge agrees with Mortimer's argument, and Charlotte is sentenced to just thirty days in prison for her assault on the policeman.\n\nEmily decides to end her engagement to Granville, after realising her only motive was to please her father. The vibrator now enters the stage as a medical device for the treatment of the condition, reducing treatment time while greatly increasing customer satisfaction. The royalties from its sale result in independent wealth for Granville, who has fallen in love with Charlotte. Pledging to use some of his wealth to establish a clinic at her settlement house, he proposes marriage to Charlotte and she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as [[Joseph Mortimer Granville|Dr. Mortimer Granville]]\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Charlotte Dalrymple\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Dr. Robert Dalrymple\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as Emily Dalrymple\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Lord Edmund St. John-Smythe\n* [[Ashley Jensen]] as Fanny\n* [[Sheridan Smith]] as Molly\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Lady St. John-Smythe\n* [[Malcolm Rennie]] as Lord St. John-Smythe\n* [[Kim Criswell]] as Mrs. Castellari\n* [[Georgie Glen]] as Mrs. Parsons\n* Elisabet Johannesdottir as Mrs. Pearce\n* Linda Woodhall as Nurse Smalley\n* Kim Selby as Lady Wheaton\n* Ann Overstall Comfort as Mrs. Huddleston\n* Jonathan Rhodes as PC Fugate\n* Leila Ana\u00efs Schaus as Tess\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mrs. Bellamy\n* [[Tobias Menzies]] as Mr. Squyers\n* Sylvia Strange as Queen Victoria\n\n==Historical background==\nThe film is based on historian [[Rachel Maines]]'s 1999 book ''The Technology of Orgasm'', which includes the claim that manual [[pelvic massage|genital massage]] of women had been a common medical remedy since antiquity.<ref name=\"maines\">{{cite book |chapter-url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/maines-technology.html |author = Maines, Rachel P. |title = The Technology of Orgasm: \"Hysteria,\" the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction | chapter=The Job Nobody Wanted |publisher =Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn = 0-8018-5941-7 | year=1999 }}</ref> In 2010, however, Maine\u2019s thesis was rebutted by [[Helen King (classicist)|Helen King]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1=King |first1=Helen | year=2011 | title=Galen and the widow: Towards a history of therapeutic masturbation in ancient gynaecology | journal=Journal on Gender Studies in Antiquity | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=205\u2013235 | url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/30726/ | issn=2156-2253 }}</ref> and a 2018 paper by [[Hallie Lieberman]] and Eric Schatzberg dismisses this idea as false, with no more than \"circumstantial evidence that a few physicians and midwives may have practiced genital massage before the 20th century\".<ref name=\"ls\"/>\n\nHysteria was a recognized malady until the [[American Psychiatric Association]] discontinued this term in 1952.<ref name=\"maines\" /> Dr. [[Joseph Mortimer Granville]] filed the first patent for an electromechanical vibrator termed ''Granville's Hammer'' in about 1883.<ref name=\"nnb\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nndb.com/people/143/000167639/ |publisher = NNBD |title = Joseph Mortimer Granville}}</ref> Granville, however, did not apply his invention in the treatment of hysteria; rather, he used it to treat muscular disorders.
