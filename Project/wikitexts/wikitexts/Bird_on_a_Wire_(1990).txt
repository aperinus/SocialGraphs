It was shot mainly in [[British Columbia]], Canada.<ref>[http://www.thompson-nicolafilmcommission.com/past_productions.php Thompson-Nicola Film Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707071444/http://www.thompson-nicolafilmcommission.com/past_productions.php |date=2007-07-07 }}</ref> The title refers to the [[Leonard Cohen]] song \"[[Bird on the Wire]]\". The alley motorcycle chase scene was filmed in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]'s [[Chinatown (Victoria)|Chinatown]], in [[Fan Tan Alley]].\n\n==Plot==\nMarianne \"Muffie\" Graves ([[Goldie Hawn]]), a former [[hippie]], is a successful lawyer completing a business deal in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. At a [[gas station]], she crosses paths with a man that looks and sounds exactly like her hippie ex-fianc\u00e9, Rick Jarmin ([[Mel Gibson]]), who disappeared in a plane crash 15 years previously and is presumed dead.  \n\nThe man pretends to be a [[Vietnam War]] veteran and Marianne apologizes, says that Rick would never have served in that war, and then leaves. The terrified man then makes a call saying that he has been recognized and needs to be moved.\n\nFifteen years earlier, Rick testified against a murderous drug-smuggling [[DEA]] agent named Eugene Sorenson ([[David Carradine]]) and has been in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]] ever since. Unfortunately, his old handler has retired and his new handler, [[FBI agent]] Joe Weyburn ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), is being blackmailed into colluding with Sorenson. Promising to have Rick moved immediately, Weyburn writes down the gas station's address and leaks it to Sorenson.\n\nMeanwhile, Sorenson has been released on parole; his partner, Albert \"Diggs\" Diggins ([[Bill Duke]]), picks him up and they set out to kill Rick for revenge and to smooth the passage of their new dealings with the [[Colombian drug cartels]].\n\nMarianne returns to confront Rick just as Diggs and Sorenson show up at the gas station with shotguns blazing. During the gunfight, Rick gets buckshot in his buttocks and his kindly old boss is killed. Marianne escapes with Rick, but Sorenson and Diggs pin the gas station owner's murder on Rick. They are forced to go on the run as Weyburn wipes out Rick's file and sends police to catch them.\n\nTo clear their names, Rick needs to reach his old handler. They use contacts from Rick's former life-in-hiding, including at a beauty salon where he was pretending to be an effeminate gay man and was the star hair dresser, and an old flame, a veterinarian who removes the buckshot.\n\nDuring a night spent in a hotel room, Rick tells Marianne everything that happened 15 years ago. They share their feelings and have passionate sex.\n\nThey reach the home of his old handler and find out he has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and thus doesn't remember Rick. Sorenson, Diggs and Weyburn show up, so Rick and Marianne retreat to a nearby zoo where Rick once worked. He releases animals from their cages to assist in their defense, and Diggs is mauled to death by a [[lion]], while Weyburn is eaten by [[piranhas]]. \n\nSorenson winds up electrocuted. Wounded, Rick winds up suspended over a [[tiger]] in a pit, requiring Marianne to save him. When she is not quite able to reach him, he offers her the extra incentive of marriage and children, which does the trick. They are then seen boating into the sunset in the Caribbean.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Richard \"Rick\" Jarmin\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Marianne Graves\n* [[David Carradine]] as Eugene Sorenson\n* [[Bill Duke]] as Albert \"Diggs\" Diggins\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Joe Weyburn\n* [[Joan Severance]] as Rachel Varney\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Lou Baird\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\n''Bird on a Wire'' gained a mixed to negative reception.<ref name=varrev>{{cite magazine|title= Film Reviews: Bird on a Wire |magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 16, 1990|page=26|author=Lor.|url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789282?refcatid=31|access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Bird on a Wire |work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1990-05-18|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/birdonawirepg13howe_a0b27b.htm|access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Bird on a Wire |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1990-05-18|url= https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317396,00.html|access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Bird on a Wire |work= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900518/REVIEWS/5180301|access-date=2010-11-16}}</ref> Of 47 reviews that ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' considered in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C., only 1 was favorable and 38 were unfavorable.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Critics Opinions|magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 23, 1990|pages=28\u201330}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=L.A.
