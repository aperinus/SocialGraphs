The stone is capable of turning base metals into gold or silver and granting eternal life. Scarlett finds the \"Rose Key\" artifact in a cave slated for demolition, but after she sees a vision of a hanged man, the demolition begins and she narrowly escapes.\n\nScarlett travels to Paris. She enlists her former lover George and her cameraman Benji. Using codes from the key, they solve a riddle on Flamel's headstone and get coordinates pointing to the [[Catacombs of Paris]]. Scarlett tries to reach the location on an official tour, but it is off-limits. A stranger tells them a guide called Papillon will help them if they find him at a nearby party. Scarlett enlists Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie and his friend Zed.\n\nPapillon takes the group to an off-limits entrance. George initially refuses to enter, but when a policeman confronts them, the group escapes into the caves. They encounter singing female cultists, including a woman they saw at the party. As the group crawls through a narrow tunnel, it collapses, trapping them and forcing them onward. The group finds a blocked tunnel, but Papillion explains people who go through that tunnel disappear. His friend La Taupe (i.e. \"The Mole\") is among the missing. He tries to take a different path, but the group somehow loops back to the blocked tunnel, and they decide to break through.\n\nInside, the group encounters La Taupe. He tells them going further down is the only way out. They eventually find a tomb with a preserved [[Templar Knight]], a mound of treasure, and the Flamel Stone. After they take the stone, attempting to take the treasure triggers a trap and collapses the room. La Taupe seems lost under the rubble.\n\nUsing the Flamel Stone, Scarlett magically heals a wound on Souxie's arm. They find a drawing of a door on the ceiling along with a [[Gnostic]] Star of David, symbolizing \"As above, so below\", which reveals a hidden opening in the floor. Going through, they find a tunnel marked with the phrase \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\" in Greek, identical to the script on the entrance to Hell in [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]].\n\nOn the other side of the tunnel, the group finds an upside-down reflection of the room they just left, where somehow La Taupe is waiting. He kills Souxie and disappears. Deeper in, the cultist from the party pushes Benji to his death. Papillon is then sucked into a burning car with an apparition of his brother inside, who looks just like the stranger who told Scarlett to find Papillon. The car implodes and buries Papillon in the floor. Scarlett, George, and Zed move on and see apparitions of terrifying spirits and demons. Statues in the wall come to life, and one rips open George's throat. Scarlett tries to heal the wound with the Flamel Stone, but cannot. She realizes she stole a false stone, and she must return it to its original place to find the real stone and heal George.\n\nScarlett races back, finding the terrain is now flooded with blood and covered in biting faces. When she returns the stone, she sees a mirror and realizes the true power of the Flamel Stone is within her. As she returns to George and Zed, she sees the same hanged man that she saw in Iran, and recognizes him as her father. She apologizes for ignoring his phone call shortly before he committed suicide, and her father vanishes. Scarlett then returns to George, healing him with a kiss. Chased by demons, the three survivors are cornered in front of a dark hole. Scarlett explains that they must jump in and confess their past sins to escape alive. George confesses that he failed to save his brother from drowning, and Zed confesses that he is refusing to claim his child. They jump into the hole and miraculously survive. They find a manhole at the bottom, which delivers them right side up to the streets of Paris. Scarlett and George hold each other while Zed walks away, finally safe. In an ending log, Scarlett says that she never sought treasure, only the truth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as Scarlett Marlowe, an accomplished scholar in search of the philosopher's stone.

There was very little use of props, as the actors had to use the environment around them. Production in the actual catacombs was difficult for the cast and especially the crew as there was no electricity or cell phone service in the centuries-old tunnels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecredits.org/2014/08/filming-in-the-paris-catacombs-for-as-above-so-below/|title=Filming in the Paris Catacombs |access-date=September 29, 2014}}</ref> As [[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]] suffered from claustrophobia, he had to keep taking breaks to cope.\n\n==Marketing and distribution==\nThe first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] of the film was revealed on April 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|title=Explorers Find the Gate to Hell in 'As Above, So Below' Horror Trailer|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2014/explorers-find-the-gate-to-hell-in-as-above-so-below-horror-trailer/|access-date=April 25, 2014|newspaper=Firstshowing.net|date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> [[YouTuber]] [[PewDiePie]] and his wife [[Marzia Bisognin]] promoted the film by embarking on a quest into the catacombs, where they would be scared in a variety of ways.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/social-media-buzz-november-man-labors-to-overcome-as-above-so-below-1201294050/ | title=Social Media Buzz: 'November Man' Labors to Overcome 'As Above, So Below' | publisher=Variety Media, LLC | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=29 August 2014 | access-date=16 March 2015 | last=Bauckhage | first= Tobias}}</ref>\n\n''As Above, So Below'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 2, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/6905/as-above,-so-below|title=As Above, So Below DVD Release Date December 2, 2014|website=DVDs Release Dates}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 27% based on 79 reviews, and an average rating of 4.70/10.
