The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[John Belushi]], [[John Candy]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Tim Matheson]], [[Toshiro Mifune]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], and [[Mickey Rourke]] in his film debut. The story involves a panic in the Los Angeles area after the December 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].\n\nCo-writer Gale stated the plot is loosely based on what has come to be known as the [[Battle of Los Angeles|Great Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942]], as well as the [[Bombardment of Ellwood|bombardment of the Ellwood oil refinery]], near [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], by a Japanese submarine. Many other events in the film were based on real incidents, including the [[Zoot Suit Riots]] and an incident in which the U.S. Army placed an anti-aircraft gun in a homeowner's yard on the Maine coast.<ref name=\"Making of 1941\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNyLRIfJ2jA| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201206015858/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNyLRIfJ2jA| archive-date=2020-12-06 | url-status=dead|title=The Making of 1941|year=1996|publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]]|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nAlthough ''1941'' was not as financially nor critically successful as many of Spielberg's other films, it received belated popularity after an expanded version aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], with subsequent television broadcasts and home video reissues, raising it to [[cult film|cult status]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.for68.com/new/2006/1/li45614246131160024-1.htm|title=What is Cult Film?|work=for68.com Beijing ICP|date=January 13, 2006|access-date=April 10, 2009|archive-date=February 19, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219103910/http://www.for68.com/new/2006/1/li45614246131160024-1.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nOn Saturday, December 13, 1941, at 7:01&nbsp;a.m. (six days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]), an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[submarine]] surfaces off the [[Coastal California|Californian coast]]. A naked woman swimming in the water is trapped atop the submarine, which is commanded by Akiro Mitamura and carrying Nazi [[Kriegsmarine]] officer Wolfgang von Kleinschmidt. Wanting to destroy something \"honorable\" in Los Angeles, Mitamura decides to target [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], but a Japanese soldier notices the woman and exclaims that she is \"Hollywood\" before the submarine dives and the woman swims away unharmed.\n\nLater that morning, a [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th Armored Division]] [[M3 Lee]] tank crew, consisting of Sergeant Frank Tree, Corporal Chuck Sitarski, and Privates Foley, Reese, and Henshaw, are having breakfast at a cafe where dishwasher Wally Stephens and his friend Dennis DeSoto both work. Wally is planning to enter a dance contest at a club that evening with his girlfriend, Betty Douglas. Sitarski instantly dislikes Wally, particularly his civilian attire, and trips him, causing a fight.\n\nIn [[Death Valley]], crazed cigar-chomping [[United States Army Air Forces]] Captain Wild Bill Kelso lands his [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] fighter near a roadside store and gas station, which he accidentally blows up while refueling. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Major General [[Joseph W. Stilwell]] attempts to calm the public, who believe Japan will attack California.\n\nDuring a press conference at [[Daugherty Field]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], Captain Loomis Birkhead, Stilwell's aide, meets his old flame Donna Stratton, who is General Stilwell's new secretary. Aware that Donna is sexually aroused by airplanes, Birkhead lures her into the cockpit of a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber to seduce her. When his amatory attempts fail, Donna punches him out; as he falls, Birkhead accidentally releases a bomb, sending it rolling towards the podium just as the General promises, \"There will be no bombs dropped here.\" The assembled reporters and audience panic and scatter as the bomb strikes the grandstand and explodes, though Stilwell and the crowd are unhurt.\n\nAt the [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] oceanside home of her father Ward Douglas and his wife Joan, Betty and her friend Maxine Dexheimer, who have both just become [[USO]] hostesses, tell Wally that they are only allowed to dance with servicemen as they are now the only male patrons allowed in the club. Wally is forced to hide in the garage when Ward, who disapproves of Wally, appears. Sgt. Tree and his tank crew arrive and inform Ward and Joan that the army wants to install an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft battery]] in their yard; Sitarski begins flirting with Betty when Wally falls from the loft where he was hiding. Wally and Sitarski recognize each other from the cafe, and Ward and the soldiers pick up Wally and dump him into a passing garbage truck.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese submarine has become lost trying to find Los Angeles after the ship's compass malfunctions. A landing party goes ashore searching for \"Hollywood\" and instead discovers lumberjack Hollis \"Holly\" Wood, who is selling [[Christmas tree]]s. After being taken prisoner aboard the sub, Hollis is searched and the crew is excited to find a small compass which was the toy surprise inside a box of \"Popper Jacks\". Hollis snatches the compass and swallows it. After the crew attempts to make Hollis pass the compass by forcing him to drink [[prune juice]], he manages to escape from the submarine and swim to shore.\n\nLater that evening, Ward's neighbor, Angelo Scioli of the [[Ground Observer Corps]], installs Claude and Herb in the [[Ferris wheel]] at the Ocean Front Amusement Park where they have volunteered to spot and report enemy aircraft. Herb has brought his [[ventriloquist's dummy]] along, greatly annoying Claude. Meanwhile, General Stilwell attends a showing of the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Dumbo]]'' at a theater on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. Determined to get Donna up in an airplane, Birkhead drives her to the 501st Bomb Disbursement Unit in [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], where the mentally unstable Colonel \"Mad Man\" Maddox shows them the unit's aircraft. Convinced the Japanese have a secret airbase hidden in the alfalfa fields of [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], Maddox lets Birkhead and Donna borrow a plane, after Birkhead offers to go on a reconnaissance flight in an attempt to locate the fictional Pomona airfield. Donna, aroused by at last being up in an airplane, eagerly begins to ravish the nervous Birkhead during the flight.\n\nOutside the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] club, Sitarski literally kicks aside Wally and drags Betty into the dance. Wally eventually sneaks in by knocking out a member of the [[Shore patrol|Shore Patrol]] and stealing his uniform. He snatches Betty from Sitarski, and they end up winning the dance contest whilst evading Sitarski, whom Maxine is relentlessly pursuing. As the contest ends, Sitarski finally punches Wally, setting off a brawl between soldiers, sailors and [[zoot suit riots|zoot suiters]]. The free-for-all spills into the street and becomes a riot.\n\nSgt. Tree arrives with his crew and breaks up the melee, just as L.A. goes to Red Alert with unknown aircraft sighted over the city. At the Douglas' home, Ward spots the surfaced submarine offshore. Birkhead and Donna, still in the throes of passion, fly over L.A., where anti-aircraft batteries open fire. Kelso pursues Birkhead's plane and shoots it down, causing it to crash into the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. He then spots the submarine near the amusement park, but before he can return to attack, Claude and Herb, who are still in the Ferris wheel, shoot down his P-40, mistaking it for a Japanese \"[[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]]\".\n\nBack on Hollywood Boulevard, Sitarski is dragging away Betty, when Wally arrives, rescues her and knocks him out cold. Kelso, who has crash landed his plane on the street, informs them of the sub near the amusement park. Sergeant Tree, knocked silly during the melee, instructs Wally to go after the submarine. Wearing an Army uniform, Wally commandeers Tree's tank and heads toward the amusement park. Back at the Douglas home, Ward begins firing the anti-aircraft gun at the submarine, almost consequently destroying his house. The sub returns fire, hitting the Ferris wheel, which causes it to roll down a pier and into the ocean, sending Claude, Herb and the dummy into the water. The tank fires at the sub and then sinks when the pier collapses and Wally, Dennis, Tree and the crew jump into the ocean. Kelso has stolen a motorcycle which he drives off the pier. He swims to the submarine, where he is captured by the Japanese; undaunted, he declares, \"Turn this tub around! You're takin' me to [[Tokyo]]!\"\n\nOn Sunday morning, December 14, 1941, Stilwell and soldiers arrive at the remains of the Douglas home, where the other protagonists have gathered and spent the night. Ward delivers an inspirational speech to everyone present, vowing that their Christmas will not be ruined by the enemy; to symbolize his point, he nails a Christmas wreath to his front door, jarring the unstable house so that it collapses down the hillside. Stilwell, observing the motley disheveled crowd who have begun arguing and fighting, tells Sgt. Tree, \"It's going to be a ''long'' war\", and he walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Motor Sergeant Frank Tree\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Ward Douglas\n* [[John Belushi]] as Captain Wild Bill Kelso\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Joan Douglas\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Claude Crumn\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Captain Wolfgang Von Kleinschmidt\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Captain Loomis Birkhead\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as Commander Akiro Mitamura\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Colonel \"Madman\" Maddox\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Major General [[Joseph W.

The chaos of the events following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack in 1941]] is summarized by Dan Aykroyd's character, Sgt. Tree, who states \"he cannot stand Americans fighting Americans.\"<ref name=\"Making of 1941\"/>\n\nRobert Zemeckis originally pitched the concept to John Milius as a serious depiction of the real-life 1942 [[Bombardment of Ellwood|Japanese bombardment of Ellwood, California]]; the subsequent [[Battle of Los Angeles|false alarm of a Japanese air raid on Los Angeles]]; and the [[Zoot Suit Riots|1943 Zoot Suit Riots]], titled ''The Night the Japs Attacked''. After development of the film transferred from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to Universal Pictures, executives insisted that the title be changed to ''Rising Sun'' to avoid the use of the derogatory term \"[[Jap]].\" The story became a comedy after Steven Spielberg became involved as director, and the script was rewritten during the production of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' in 1977. The characters of Claude Crumm and Herb Kaziminsky were originally written with ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' co-stars [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Art Carney]] in mind. Hollis P. \"Holly\" Wood and \"Wild Bill\" Kelso were originally minor characters before Belushi and Pickens were cast.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=1941|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/67171|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-12|website=AFI Catalog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721231818/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67171 |archive-date=July 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n''1941'' is also notable as one of the few American films featuring [[Toshiro Mifune]], a popular [[Japanese people|Japanese]] actor.

Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it.
