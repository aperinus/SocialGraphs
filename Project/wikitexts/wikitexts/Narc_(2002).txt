The plot revolves around the efforts of two police detectives in search of the murderer of an [[undercover]] police officer. As they investigate, they engage in unethical behavior and uncover dark secrets that will challenge their fragile relationship.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] calls for film plots to be 400-700 words; the word count for this article is currently 859. -->\n[[Undercover police|Undercover]] narcotics officer Nick Tellis chases a drug dealer through the streets of [[Detroit]]. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer when he holds a child hostage, but a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to [[miscarriage|miscarry]]. Eighteen months later, Tellis is tasked with investigating the murder of an undercover officer, Michael Calvess. Tellis reluctantly agrees to take the case on two conditions: that he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction, and that he is partnered with Detective Henry Oak, whom Tellis has read about in the Calvess case file. The police chief accepts Tellis' conditions, but warns him about Oak's instability.\n\nDuring their first meeting, Oak reveals to Tellis his belief that the department wants the Calvess case buried and it is all about politics. The detectives visit the scene where a drug dealer has been shot dead in his bathtub; Tellis surmises the death was accidental and self-inflicted. Tellis notes that the shotgun at the scene is a [[SWAT]] weapon with the serial number filed off.\n\nWhile the partners have a discussion about family, Oak recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a ten-year-old girl who was being sold into [[prostitution]] by her stepfather, resulting in Oak beating the man; he sees parallels with the current case. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her relationship with her husband while he was on the street. Oak, who is protective of Calvess' family, turns up at the house and angrily confronts Tellis.\n\nThe detectives next visit the home of a man involved in Tellis' shooting. Although they find no evidence to suggest he murdered Calvess, they find another officer's badge on the premises. The man pulls a gun and wounds Tellis before Oak kills him in [[self-defense]]. The case assailant is determined to be Calvess' killer and the case is closed. However, Tellis and Oak are furious as they believe the killer has yet to be found and continue to investigate independently.\n\nWhen the detectives visit an auto body shop, Oak attempts to force a confession out of a pair of suspects. Tellis is increasingly suspicious of Oak's tactics. Tellis finds police-issue guns in a car belonging to one of the suspects, including one that belonged to Calvess. Oak beats both men until Tellis tells him to get [[forensic science|CSI tools]] from the car.\n\nWhen Oak leaves the room, Tellis locks the door and asks for the truth from the suspects. They explain that Calvess, who had fallen into drug addiction, blew Tellis' cover eighteen months before and caused the shooting. On the day of the murder, Calvess tried to deal with the two dealers, but it went badly.\n\nAccording to their story, Oak arrived, having trailed Calvess to confirm rumors that he was an addict. Calvess went for his weapon, which was the dealers' justification for attacking him. The two men ran off as Oak shot at them. Tellis confronts Oak and accuses him of murdering Calvess, which Oak denies. Tellis then raises the issue of Oaks' relationship with Calvess' wife, Kathryn.\n\nKathryn was the ten-year-old girl who was pimped out by her stepfather. Oak considers her the daughter he never had and has remained close. He has been protecting her by covering crimes she committed in her teenage years. Tellis tells Oak he will make the arrest and Oak beats him with the shotgun and resumes brutalizing the dealers.\n\nOak turns the tape recorder on and attempts to beat a confession out of the men, threatening to shoot them. Tellis breaks into their car, retrieves a gun, calls for back-up, and re-enters the building. He shoots Oak when Oak refuses to put his gun down. Tellis moves to aid Oak and, realizing he's dying, pleads for the truth of what happened the night Calvess died.\n\nOak explains that Calvess shot at the dealers as they fled from Oak, leaving the shoulder wound. Oak argued with him, explaining that he had had enough of defending Calvess and would turn him in to the department. In despair, Calvess shot himself. Oak had been protecting his name and family so Calvess' wife could receive his pension. Oak's motive was to convict the dealers, whom he felt had made Mike a junkie. Oak dies in Tellis' arms, leaving the confession on tape and Tellis with only moments to decide what to do with it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Detective Nick Tellis\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Lieutenant Henry Oak\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Captain Cheevers\n* A.C.

The script was pitched as \"a raw [[Police procedural|cop drama]] in the tradition of the 70's films of [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[William Friedkin]].\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=2002-11-03 |title=The Way We Live Now: 11-3-02: Process; The Insiders' Indie |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/03/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-11-3-02-process-the-insiders-indie.html |access-date=2022-10-18 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The script failed to generate interest, with Carnahan saying financiers told him, <nowiki>''This is an ''</nowiki>''[[NYPD Blue|N.Y.P.D.
