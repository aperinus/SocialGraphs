His latest film ends with a surreal sequence in which a character (played by Bates) is trapped on a train carriage surrounded by grotesque and unhappy figures. The character looks out the carriage window and sees another train filled with beautiful and happy people. Convinced he is on the wrong train, he tries unsuccessfully to get off the train before it speeds away. In the next scene, all the characters from the train wander aimlessly through an immense garbage dump. Bates\u2019 character sees that the passengers from the other train have also ended up at the dump. Studio executives, having watched Bates\u2019 film, complain that it is uncommercial and depressing. When this is conveyed to Bates, he insists that he no longer wants to make shallow comedy films, as this no longer feels honest to him.\n\nBates' managers remind him that he is scheduled to appear at a weekend-long retrospective of his films at the Stardust Hotel on the Jersey Shore. He is reluctant but agrees to attend. Through the weekend, Bates is haunted by memories of Dorrie, a former lover with mental illness issues. He recalls his first meeting with Dorrie on the set of one of his films, the blossoming of their relationship, and its later deterioration through a combination of her insecurities and his philandering. His last meeting with Dorrie takes place in a psychiatric hospital, where she is depressed and heavily medicated.\n\nArriving at the Stardust Hotel, Bates is swamped by fans, who often make bizarre or comical requests from him. He attends screenings of his films, and then submits to question and answer sessions. After the first session, he is invited to a nearby club by a young couple, Jack and Daisy, and he eagerly agrees. At the nightclub, Bates uses an instance of Jack\u2019s absence to openly flirt with Daisy.\n\nThe following day, Bates\u2019 current lover Isobel, a married mother of two, arrives at the hotel to join him. She announces that she has left her husband. Bates responds ambivalently to this news, but considers taking their relationship to the next level. Bates also meets with executives from his film studio, who have reshot the ending of his film, with the characters ending up in \u201cjazz heaven\u201d, instead of the garbage dump. Bates declares the idea to be idiotic, and refuses to accept it.\n\nWhile talking with his agent on a public phone, Bates overhears Daisy talking about her sexual ambivalence towards Jack. Later, Bates organises an outing alone with Daisy. While the two are together, Bates' car breaks down and they are forced to continue on foot. They arrive at a large field, where they encounter a congregation of locals awaiting the appearance of flying saucers. During this encounter, Bates begins losing touch with reality, imagining or hallucinating various figures from his life and films, as well as a group of extraterrestrials (who advise him to continue making comedies). He finally imagines a psychotic fan who shoots him dead.\n\nActually having fainted in a panic attack, Bates fantasizes that he is given a posthumous award for his life\u2019s work. He accepts the award in person, and tells the audience that the one moment in his life where he felt truly happy and fulfilled was on a sunny morning in his New York apartment, passing the time with Dorrie, reading and listening to [[Louis Armstrong]]\u2019s version of \u201c[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\u201d. As Bates awakes from his fainting spell, he speaks Dorrie\u2019s name, which angers Isobel, who has been waiting by his bedside. She attempts to break up with him, prompting him to abandon the retrospective and follow her onto her train. He passionately persuades her to forgive him, and they kiss as the train departs.\n\nThese events are observed by a film audience, which includes many figures who appear as characters in the film itself. As this film ends, they discuss its merits and flaws, and share their experiences of making it. As the audience departs the theater, a figure resembling Bates enters, retrieves his iconic sunglasses from a seat, and then exits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Sandy Bates\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Dorrie\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Daisy\n* [[Marie-Christine Barrault]] as Isobel\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Tony\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Actor\n* [[Amy Wright]] as Shelley\n* [[Helen Hanft]] as Vivian Orkin\n* [[John Rothman]] as Jack Abel\n* Anne De Salvo as Sandy's Sister\n* [[Leonardo Cimino]] as Sandy's Analyst\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Pretty Girl on Train (Of the train window through which she blows a kiss during the opening sequence, Stone remarked, \"I gave it my best shot to melt that sucker\".<ref name=\"Fox1996\">{{cite book|author=Julian Fox|title=Woody: Movies from Manhattan|url=https://archive.org/details/woodymoviesfromm0000foxj|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Overlook Press|isbn=978-0-87951-692-5}}</ref>)\n* Allen's long-time manager and producer [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]] as a Studio Executive (Rollins and his partner [[Charles H.

Like many of Allen's films, ''Stardust Memories'' incorporates several [[jazz]] recordings including those by such notables as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Django Reinhardt]], and [[Chick Webb]]. The film's title alludes to the famous take of \"[[Stardust (1927 song)|Stardust]]\" recorded in 1931 by Armstrong, wherein the trumpeter sings \"oh, memory\" three times in succession. However, it is the master take that plays in the movie during the sequence where Sandy is remembering the best moment of his life: looking at Dorrie while listening to Armstrong's recording of the song.\n\nThe film deals with issues regarding religion, God, and philosophy; especially existentialism, psychology, symbolism, wars and politics.  It is also about realism, relationships, and death.  It refers to many questions about the meaning of life. It also ruminates on the role that luck plays in life, a theme Allen would revisit in ''Match Point''.\n\n==Production==\nFilming locations include:\n* [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]], USA\n* [[Belmar, New Jersey]], USA\n* [[Deal, New Jersey]], USA\n* [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], USA\n* [[Neptune City, New Jersey]], USA\n* [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey]], USA<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web |title=Filming locations for Stardust Memories |website=[[Internet Movie Database]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081554/locations |access-date=April 26, 2012 |archive-date=July 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729140546/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081554/locations |url-status=live }} {{better source needed|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the sleevenotes of MGM's 2000 DVD release: \"Shot on location in the fall of 1979, ''Stardust Memories'' may look as though it takes place in a Victorian-style seaside hotel, but it was actually shot at the [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey|Ocean Grove]] Great Auditorium and the Methodist Episcopal Conference Center and Concert Hall in New Jersey.
