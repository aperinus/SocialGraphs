The film addressed rebuilding the program and the healing that the community undergoes. Dr. H. Keith Spears was the Marshall University consultant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758794/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl|title=We Are Marshall (2006) - IMDb|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the evening of November 14, 1970, [[Southern Airways Flight 932]], a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] chartered by [[Marshall University]] to transport the Thundering Herd football team back to [[Huntington, West Virginia]] following their 17\u201314 defeat to the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina University Pirates]], clips trees on a ridge just one mile short of the runway at [[Tri-State Airport]] in [[Ceredo, West Virginia]], and crashes into a nearby gully, killing all 75 people on board.\n\nThe deceased include the 37 players; head coach [[Rick Tolley]] and five members of his coaching staff; Charles E. Kautz, Marshall's athletic director; team athletic trainer Jim Schroer and his assistant, Donald Tackett; sports information director and radio play-by-play announcer Gene Morehouse; 25 [[booster club|boosters]]; and five crew members.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, University President [[Donald Dedmon]] leans towards indefinitely suspending the football program, but he is ultimately persuaded to reconsider by the pleas of the Marshall students and Huntington residents, and especially the few football players who didn't make the flight, led by Nate Ruffin. Dedmon hires [[Jack Lengyel]] as head coach who, with the help of [[William \"Red\" Dawson|Red Dawson]] (one of two surviving members of the previous coaching staff) manages to rebuild the team in a relatively short time, despite losing many of their prospects to the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University Mountaineers]]. Dedmon travels to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where he pleads with the [[NCAA]] to waive their rule prohibiting freshmen from playing varsity football (a rule which had been abolished in 1968 for all sports except for football and basketball, and would be permanently abolished for those sports in 1972). Dedmon returns victorious.\n\nThe new team is composed mostly of the 18 returning players (three varsity, 15 sophomores) and walk-on athletes from other Marshall sports programs. Due to their lack of experience, the \"Young Thundering Herd\" ends up losing its first game, 29\u20136, to the [[Morehead State University|Morehead State]] Eagles. The loss weighs heavily on Dawson and Ruffin, who had been hurt on the first play of the game. The Herd's first post-crash victory is a 15\u201313 win against [[Xavier University]] in the first home game of the season. Hours after the victory a grief-stricken Coach Dawson remains in the team's locker room, in disbelief over the Herd's first win since the crash. He walks out to a still-full stadium of Marshall fans who share his astonishment and don't want to leave the stadium either.\n\nIn the film's closing credits, we learn of the futures of each of the film's main characters: Coach Jack Lengyel, Coach Dawson, Nate Ruffin, Reggie Oliver, President Dedmon, Keith Morehouse, and others; and of the eventual success of Marshall football in the decades following the tragedy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Jack Lengyel]]\n*[[Matthew Fox]] as [[William \"Red\" Dawson]]\n*[[Anthony Mackie]] as Nate Ruffin\n*[[Arlen Escarpeta]] as [[Reggie Oliver (American football)|Reggie Oliver]]\n*[[David Strathairn]] as [[Donald Dedmon]]\n*[[Ian McShane]] as Paul Griffen\n*[[Kate Mara]] as Annie Cantrell\n*[[January Jones]] as Carole Dawson\n*[[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]] as Sandy Lengyel\n*[[Brian Geraghty]] as Tom Bogdan\n*[[Mike Pniewski]] as [[Bobby Bowden]]\n*[[Robert Patrick]] as Coach [[Rick Tolley]] (uncredited)\n*[[Sonny Perdue|Georgia Gov.

The premiere for the film was held at the [[Keith-Albee Theatre]] on December 12, 2006, in Huntington; other special screenings were held at [[Pullman Square]]. The movie was released nationwide on December 22, 2006.\n\n==Home media==\n''We Are Marshall'' was released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray]] in the United States on September 18, 2007.\n\n==Closing credits==\n\nDuring the final moments of the movie, a voiceover from Annie explains where the program went after that first season, the highs and lows. Actual game footage serves as a backdrop, including a regular season game against the [[Akron Zips football#Gordon Larson era (1961\u20131972)|Akron Zips]] in which offensive linemen carried an injured [[Byron Leftwich]] back to the huddle after each play. As the final credits roll, actual footage from the 1970 season is shown, featuring players who perished in the crash. Also shown is news footage from the crash. As the cast credits roll, each actor is shown standing with the real-life person who they portrayed in the film.\nThe film fades out with scenes of Marshall's rise to becoming an NCAA Division 1-AA power in the 1980s and 1990s, and their subsequent jump to Division 1-A (FBS).\n\n==Lawsuit==\nDeborah Novak and John Witek, who produced the 2000 documentary ''[[Marshall University: Ashes to Glory]]'', filed a $100 million lawsuit in federal court in [[California]] accusing [[Warner Bros.]] and others associated with the ''We Are Marshall'' film of [[fraud]], [[copyright infringement]], and [[breach of contract]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-cacdce/case_no-2:2007cv04000/case_id-390831/|title=Deborah Novak et al v.

Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 49% out of 127 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10 and the site's consensus stating: \"Matthew McConaughey almost runs ''We Are Marshall'' to the end zone, but can't stop it from taking the easy, feel-good route in memorializing this historic event in American sports.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_are_marshall/|title=We Are Marshall|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film's directing was criticized by many reviewers. Peter Hartlaub, from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', blamed director McG for \"half of the movie problems\" and went further on saying that \"He has a kinetic and kitschy style that could make next year's \"Hot Wheels\" movie a surprise hit, but he's completely out of place here.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Marshall-fumbles-in-telling-moving-true-story-2483313.php|title='Marshall' fumbles in telling moving true story|work=SFGate|date=December 22, 2006|access-date=November 5, 2014}}</ref> Peter Howell from the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' said the film lacked genuine drama or conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/164241|title='We Are Marshall': Predictable pigskin tale|last=Howell|first=Peter|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]|access-date=November 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603070400/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/164241|archive-date=June 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nMcConaughey's performance was, according to some critics, one of the film's highlights. Roger Moore from the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave it 4 stars out of 5 and said in his review that \"''We Are Marshall'' (it's the rally cry of the team) doesn't always have a handle on the grief, but it does keep emotions close to the surface. That allows McConaughey to be the most refreshing, funny and believable he ever has been.\"<ref>http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-db-moviereviews-searchresults,0,3279701,results.formprofile?turbine_cdb_lib__cdb_01_txt=We%20Are%20Marshall&Find+it%21=Submit+Query {{dead link|date=November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://wearemarshall-themovie.warnerbros.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Mojo title|wearemarshall}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.marshall.edu/movie/ ''We Are Marshall'' at Marshall University]\n\n{{McG}}\n{{Marshall Thundering Herd football navbox}}\n{{Marshall University}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2006 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American football films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by McG]]\n[[Category:Films produced by McG]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in West Virginia]]\n[[Category:Legendary Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Marshall Thundering Herd football]]\n[[Category:Sports films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Wonderland Sound and Vision films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christophe Beck]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about sportspeople]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of players of American football]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Basil Iwanyk]]\n[[Category:Thunder Road Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
