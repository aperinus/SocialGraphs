The film is written by the creators of ''[[MADtv]]'', Fax Bahr and Adam Small, who also serve as producers. The character of \"B-Rad\" (a spoof of [[Eminem]]'s character \"B-Rabbit\" in the film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'') originally appeared in Jamie Kennedy's hidden-camera show ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]'',  but started in his stand-up routine when he was starting out; here, \"B-Rad\" is Brad, the son of Senator Bill Gluckman who is running for governor of California and fears his son is a distraction on the campaign trail, with Brad's aspirations of becoming a rapper and his glamorization of gang life. To that end, Gluckman hires two actors to stage an abduction to bring Brad to an inner city neighborhood where he will learn to behave himself.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centers on the family life of Bill Gluckman, a wealthy [[Jewish]] [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[Malibu, California]] who is running for the office of [[governor of California]]. His son Brad is a wannabe \"[[Eminem]]\", preferring to go by the nickname \"B-Rad\" despite leading a rich, sheltered life. As a result, members of Mr. Gluckman's political campaign become concerned that Brad's idiotic, outlandish behavior will ruin his father's chances at being elected.\n\nThe campaign team members hire two actors, Sean and PJ, who don't know any more about inner-city life than B-Rad, to act as gang members. They [[kidnapping|kidnap]] him, and take him to [[South Los Angeles|South]] [[Los Angeles]], where PJ's cousin Shondra lives, and they hope B-Rad will be \"scared white\" after witnessing what inner city life is really like. The trio engages in mildly dangerous activities such as petty theft in order to convince B-Rad that he should return home.\n\nThe three involuntarily become mixed up between rival gangs, unfortunately crossing paths with the leader of one of the gangs, Tec, after bumping into him at a club, and who also happens to be Shondra\u2019s ex. In the meantime, B-Rad develops feelings for Shondra, who at first is unimpressed and annoyed, but slowly begins to enjoy B-Rad's company, and eventually admire him for who he truly is.\n\nB-Rad comes to find out that the entire excursion to head to South Central was a ruse in order for him to be scared out of his mannerisms, and soon takes matters into his own hands, turning the tables on his would-be captors. His recklessness leads to the trio becoming actually kidnapped by Tec and his crew, unbeknownst to B-Rad, who just assumes this is part of the act. Tec soon becomes impressed at intimidation tactics portrayed by B-Rad as a result of playing ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''. Unfortunately, during a house party, B-Rad almost gets shot by Tec for a misunderstanding with Shondra (he accidentally shot himself in the foot, yet it barely grazed him due to his poor aim). When Bill Gluckman realizes that his son is in actual danger, he rushes over, and uses his trademark negotiating skills in order to ease the situation. In doing so, he realizes that he should just accept B-Rad for who he is, and decides that he will support his son unconditionally. The two reconcile, and when the family returns to Malibu, the film closes with Bill and B-Rad celebrating a Gluckman win in the governors' race.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Brad \"B-Rad G\" Gluckman\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Sean \"Bloodbath\"\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as P.J. \"Tree\"\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Shondra\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Tom Gibbons\n* [[Damien Dante Wayans]] as \"Tec\"\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Bill Gluckman\n* [[Bo Derek]] as Bess Gluckman\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Dr. Feldman\n* [[Kal Penn]] as Hadji\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as Ronnie Rizzat (voice)\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as \"Mocha\"\n* Keili Lefkovitz as \"Monster\"\n* [[Kellie Martin]] as Jen\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Brett\n* [[J.

Not only are these themes explored explicitly by the actions of B-Rad, but also by Sean and PJ. There is an expectation of how black people are portrayed in Hollywood that is explored in depth in the manner in which Sean and PJ practice acting \"gangsta\" in order to prove their blackness. In an interview conducted by Brian Balchack from Movieweb.com, Taye Diggs notes that \"the interesting thing, being an African-American actor, is that we're constantly challenged with the duality of acting stereotypically \u201cblack,\u201d and just acting. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck don't have to read for a role and ask themselves, \u2018Okay, do they want me to say this word like this, or can I just be myself?' I know tons of black actors that didn't grow up in the \u2018hood, and don't have their \u201cgangster lingo\u201d down, who take it to another level when they go in for a gangster role. I think that that's very interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/exclusive-jamie-kennedy-taye-diggs-anthony-anderson-on-malibus-most-wanted/ |title=Jamie Kennedy, Taye Diggs, & Anthony Anderson on MALIBU'S MOST WANTED! |work= [[movieweb.com]]|date=11 April 2003 }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Malibu's Most Wanted'' was released on VHS and DVD on September 9, 2003. \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/1454/Malibu's-Most-Wanted-(2003).html|title = Malibu's Most Wanted DVD Release Date}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malibu's Most Wanted (soundtrack)|''Malibu's Most Wanted'' (soundtrack)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0328099}}\n\n{{John Whitesell}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2000s hip hop films]]\n[[Category:2000s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:2003 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American gang films]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Whitesell]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Malibu, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Nick Swardson]]\n[[Category:Hood comedy films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
