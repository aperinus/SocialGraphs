The film's plot concerns four teenagers who become trapped in a [[dark ride]] at a local carnival in Iowa and are stalked by a deformed murderous carnie.\n\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]], the film was director Hooper's first major studio production after ''[[Eaten Alive]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974). Upon its release on March 13, 1981, it grossed $7.8 million and received mixed to positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn small-town [[Iowa]], a masked intruder attacks teenager Amy as she showers. The attacker turns out to be her younger brother Joey, a [[horror film]] fan, and his weapon is a fake rubber prop knife.\n\nAgainst her father's wishes, Amy visits a sleazy [[traveling carnival]] with her new boyfriend Buzz, her best friend Liz, and Liz's irresponsible boyfriend Richie. At the carnival, the four teens smoke [[marijuana]], peep into a 21-and-over [[strip show]], heckle [[fortune teller]] Madame Zena, visit the [[freak show|freaks-of-nature]] exhibit, and view a [[illusionist|magic show]].\n\nRichie dares the group to spend the night in \"The Funhouse\", which is actually a [[dark ride]]. After the park closes, the teenagers settle down inside the funhouse. Through a grate to a room below the attraction, the teenagers witness the ride assistant, a silent man in a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] mask, engage Zena as a [[prostitute]]. He experiences [[premature ejaculation]], but despite his request, Zena will not return her $100 fee. He murders her in a violent rage.\n\nThe teenagers try to leave, but find themselves locked inside the funhouse. As they attempt to escape, Richie secretly steals the money from the [[safe]] from which the masked assistant took Zena's fee. The funhouse's [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], Conrad Straker, discovers what his son Gunther Twibunt (the masked assistant) has done to Zena. Conrad also realizes that the money is missing. Thinking Gunther took it, he attacks him. Gunther's face is revealed to be gruesomely deformed via Albinism and Frontonasal Dysplasia with sharp protruding teeth, long white thinning hair, red eyes, and a cleft running up the bridge up his nose.\n\nThe teens see this, and Conrad realizes someone is watching after Richie's lighter falls on the floor from the ceiling he and the others were hiding in. Buzz concludes that Richie has the money. Richie insists that he would have split the money with the others. Despite Liz wanting to return the money, Buzz knows it is too late since they are now in danger. Conrad stalks the funhouse to eliminate any witnesses and heckles Gunther into a murderous rage. The teens arm themselves with the various funhouse props as weapons.\n\nRichie is [[hanging|hanged]] with a rope by Conrad, and the remaining three witness his corpse riding through on a cart. Liz, hysterical, falls through a [[trap door]] and is confronted by Gunther. She stabs him with a dagger, and he kills her by pushing her head through an [[industrial fan|industrial exhaust fan]]. Buzz stabs Conrad to death when he confronts him and Amy, but is then killed by Gunther. During a showdown between [[final girl]] Amy and Gunther in the funhouse's maintenance area, Gunther is electrocuted and crushed to death between two spinning gears.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the traumatized [[final girl|sole survivor]] Amy emerges from the funhouse and heads home as the [[animatronics|animatronic]] fat lady perched atop the entrance laughs mockingly at her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Elizabeth Berridge (actress)|Elizabeth Berridge]] as Amy Harper\n* [[Cooper Huckabee]] as Buzz\n* [[Largo Woodruff]] as Liz Duncan\n* [[Miles Chapin]] as Richie\n* [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Freak Show Barker / Strip Show Barker / Conrad Straker (The Funhouse Barker)\n* Wayne Doba as Gunther Twibunt (The Monster)\n* [[Sylvia Miles]] as Madame Zena\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Marco the Magnificent\n* Shawn Carson as Joey Harper\n* Rebuka Hoye as Strip Show Dancer\n* Jack McDermott as Mr. Paul Harper\n* Jeanne Austin as Mrs. Ellen Harper\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn the 2021 book ''American Twilight: The Cinema of Tobe Hooper'', writers Kristopher Woofter and Will Dodson note a recurring theme throughout ''The Funhouse'' of a world in which adults mistreat and look down upon teenagers, characterizing them as \"a corrupt [[cabal]] disenfranchising the young.\"{{sfn|Woofter|Dodson|2021|p=33}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Funhouse'' was written by Larry Block, and the script was purchased by [[Universal Pictures]], who were looking to produce a teen-aimed horror film after the success of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980).{{Sfn|Nowell |2010 |p=174}}\n\n===Filming===\nThough set in the [[Midwestern United States|American Midwest]] in Iowa,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2014/04/21/ultimate-list-of-iowa-movies/7913481/|work=[[Des Moines Register]]|title=The ultimate list of Iowa movies|date=April 24, 2014|last=West|first=Adam|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/oPsiY|archive-date=September 18, 2022}}</ref> ''The Funhouse'' was shot on the backlots of Norin Studios in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2016/02/16/slashback-something-not-quite-human-is-waiting-in-the-funhouse-1981/|publisher=[[Blumhouse Productions]]|title=Slashback!
