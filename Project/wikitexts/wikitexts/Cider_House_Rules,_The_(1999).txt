He is returned twice by [[Foster Care|foster parents]]: the first felt he was too quiet (due to orphanage babies soon learning crying is pointless) and the second beat him. Dr. Larch is addicted to [[Diethyl ether|ether]] and also secretly performs [[abortions]]. Conditions at the orphanage are sparse, but the children have love, are given respect, and are like an extended family. With older kids like Buster looking out for the younger ones and in particular care for those who are sickly like Fuzzy Stone who was born [[Premature birth|prematurely]] to an [[alcoholic]] mother suffering from [[bronchitis]] and as such spends most of his time beneath a plastic tent ventilated with a breathing apparatus. Each night before sleeping, Dr. Larch says to them, \"Goodnight you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England\", as both an encouragement and a kind of blessing.\n\nHomer, the oldest of the orphans, is very bright, helpful and even-tempered, so Larch trains him in [[obstetrics]] and abortions as an [[apprentice]]; despite Homer's never having attended high school. He disapproves of abortions, and, although he has been trained by Larch, he refuses to perform them. After several years, Homer is very skillful and confident in performing obstetrical duties. Larch wants him to take over after he retires, but Homer feels it's impossible, as he lacks formal medical education and he wants to see the outside world beyond the orphanage. Homer leaves with Candy Kendall and her boyfriend Wally Worthington, a young couple who came to the clinic for an abortion.  Wally is a pilot on leave from the service. Wally's mother, Olive, owns the Worthington family apple orchard where Homer settles as a worker. He lives on the Worthington estate in Cider House, the bunkhouse. Wally returns to [[World War II]]. Homer is exempt from this as Dr. Larch has diagnosed him with a heart condition.\n\nWhile Wally is away, Candy starts flirting with Homer and they have an affair. He picks apples with Arthur Rose's team of migrant workers, employed seasonally at the orchard by the Worthingtons, and illiterate. Homer reads them the posted rules of the Cider House, the workers observe the rules have been made without the occupants' consent by people who do not live there and so do not face their problems.  Consequently, they feel that they can ignore them.  Homer and Candy become much closer during harvest and spend more time together while Wally is fighting in Burma. During this time while watching a private screening of [[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]] Fuzzy Stone succumbs to his bronchitis with his death covered up by Larch, Buster and the other staff who falsely claim to all the orphans that Fuzzy was just adopted to keep up morale but their loss hits everyone hard none so more than Larch.\n\nAfter Arthur and his team come back to work the following season, Homer discovers that Rose, Arthur's daughter, is pregnant. Candy finds out that the baby's father is Arthur. Homer decides he must help Rose, and performs an abortion with Arthur's assistance. A few days later, as Rose tries to run away, her father goes to say goodbye; she stabs him and flees. He then makes the injury worse, and as a last request, asks Homer and another worker to tell the police his death was a suicide.\n\nWally returns from Burma a paraplegic, and although she loves Homer, Candy decides to take care of Wally. Immediately after this, Homer learns Dr. Larch accidentally overdosed on ether. Homer decides he is most needed in the orphanage, where he is greeted joyously by both the children and staff. He learns not only did Larch fake his medical record to keep him out of the war, but also faked college credentials and also used [[reverse psychology]] to convince the orphanage board to appoint Homer as the next director. He fills the paternal role that Larch previously held for the children of the orphanage, telling them, \"Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Homer Wells\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Wilbur Larch\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Candy Kendall\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Lt.
