The film was a [[Box-office bomb|financial failure]], grossing $40 million on a budget of $62 million, and was panned by both [[film criticism|critics]] and audiences. It also won 3 [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Awards]] including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]].\n\nThe [[Guru]] Pitka ([[Mike Myers]]) is tasked with revitalizing the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team. The team has been plagued with losses and their star player suffers a marital tragedy that throws him off his game. In order for Pitka to become the next [[Deepak Chopra]], he must help the team actualize their potential to win the [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nGuru Pitka is the self proclaimed \"number-two guru in the world\", after [[Deepak Chopra]]. A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka asks if he can still [[masturbate]] but is warned if he attempts to he  will become blind with [[strabismus]] like Tugginmypudha. \n\nPitka's dream is to become the number-one guru and appear on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Mariska Hargitay]] (whose name he uses as a greeting, even to Hargitay themselves). His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] [[slide show]]s.\n\nIn Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for [[Los Angeles Kings]] goaltender Jacques \"L\u00e8 Coq\" Grand\u00e9. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him $2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the [[Stanley Cup]]. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] will have him on her show. Pitka meets the team coach Cherkoff who is there with Jane for his seminar, Pitka mocks his [[dwarfism]].\n\nPitka and Jane bond on the plane ride. Jane became a fan of Pitka's work due to the death of her father. Jane admits she has a crush on him and Pitka asks if she has a husband or a boyfriend, to which she says no. Pitka asks if she is a lesbian, she chuckles but admits to experimenting once in college which causes Pitka to get an erection and his chastity belt loudly clanks. \nHe grimaces in discomfort and crosses his leg over his lap.\n\nPitka is surprised she is single. Jane asks why, first he compliments her intelligence and friendliness but quickly his comments get more libidinous as he mentions her bedroom eyes, pouty lips and great rack.\nJane reveals the \"Bullard Curse.\" Canadian hockey fans dislike her very much and throw food at her when they see her.\n\nPitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up L\u00e8 Coq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck.\n\nLater, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He has his assistant Rajneesh prepare a dish called \u201cnuts in a sling\u201c which is two lychee nuts in a dough pouch resembling a scrotum, the first step is whacking it with a mallet, Pitka moans and groans in pain until he stops Rajneesh by shouting his safe word. Next it is dipped in hot oily water. Pitka groans in pain but then he moans and chuckles orgasmically. Pitka tries to kiss Jane, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games due to Pitka\u2019s odd methods and antics plus mistreatment of him Coach Cherkov berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt shaking his fist but the belt does not protect Pitka as his [[Testicle|testicles]] are stretched apart in the [[chastity belt]] and he is already suffering from thirty three years of [[blue balls]]. Pitka groans and grabs his crotch hunching over.  He shouts [[Omar Sharif]]'s name in vain and drops to the ground. He throws a [[tantrum]] about the pain in his [[balls (slang)|balls]], he tearfully grumbles and calls Cherkoff a prick. Cherkoff tells him \"stay down bitch\", fearing another [[groin attack]] Pitka responds \"okay\" submissively.  Pitka chases after Jane as she says Cherkoff is right and Pitka tries to [[gaslighting|gaslight]] her into [[optimism bias]] but she yells at him to do his job with fixing Darren.\n\nDick Pants warns Pitka to hurry up the process or he will lose his spot on ''Oprah'' again to Deepak Chopra. Pitka is adamant that Darren is not ready. Pitka and Darren attempt a confrontation, but her invective ends up scaring both of them away. Pitka helps Darren realise that since his mother only showed him love when he succeeded he had grown to believe Prudence would only love him as long as he won. Pitka then drives himself and Darren to Niagara Falls for a \"Heart to Heart\".\n\nWith time running out, Pitka distracts L\u00e8 Coq with his idol, [[Celine Dion]], then tells Prudence that Darren stood up to his mom, encouraging her to return to her husband. During the lead up to the final game, L\u00e8 Coq, having heard that Darren cannot play with his mother in the audience, gets her to sing the national anthem, causing Darren to flee. At the airport on his way to guest on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|''Oprah'']], Pitka sees the news on television and defies his agent by going back to help Darren. Pitka reveals to Jane his chastity belt to explain why he pulled away from her, and Jane reveals that she is understanding of his spiritual vow. \n\nAfter smoothing things over with his mother, Darren recovers until L\u00e8 Coq brags that Prudence prefers him in bed. Darren freezes and Pitka realizes he needs another distraction, which he provides by getting two elephants to have sex in the middle of the rink, in front of the live television audience (which Pitka claimed would distract anybody). Darren wakes up from his stupor and scores the winning goal. After the game, Coach Cherkov apologizes for the [[groin attack]], Pitka offers a hug but as Cherkoff obliges he punches him in the face and threatens to beat him up if he ever attacks him again. They then make up and  become friends.\n\nHe then meets Deepak Chopra and decides that he is fine with being the first Guru Pitka instead of the next Deepak Chopra.\n\nBack in India, Tugginmypudha tells Pitka that he has finally learned to love himself and removes Pitka's chastity belt, revealing there was a hook in the back. The film ends with Jane and Pitka dancing together in a [[Bollywood]]-style number to a rendition of \"[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]\".\n\nIn the deleted/extended ending, Pitka and Jane consummate their relationship and Jane says \"damn\" after being impressed with Pitka\u2019s love making skills. She lifts up the covers and asks about his pubic tattoo of [[Daffy Duck]] pushing a lawn mower through his pubes (a [[Callback (comedy)|callback]] to the Niagara Falls bonding chat with Darren) and they have sex again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Guru Maurice Pitka / Himself \u2013 Pitka is the 2nd top guru behind [[Deepak Chopra]].
