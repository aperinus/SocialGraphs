It is based on the 1992 [[Dolores Claiborne|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]]. The plot focuses on the strained relationship between a mother and her daughter, largely told through [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, after her daughter arrives to her remote hometown on a [[Maine]] island where her mother has been accused of murdering the elderly woman for whom she had long been a care-provider and companion.{{sfn|McCaughey|King|2001|p=149}}\n\n''Dolores Claiborne'' was the second major King film adaptation to star Bates in a leading role after ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990) five years earlier. The screenplay for was adapted by [[Tony Gilroy]], and the film was shot in [[Nova Scotia]] in 1994. It was a sleeper hit, grossing close to $50 million worldwide on a $13 million budget and little promotion. The film was well-received by critics, with the performances of Bates and Leigh being especially praised. Kathy Bates stated in a retrospective interview that her performance as the titular Dolores was her favorite performance she had ever given.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/26/133247321/Kathy-Bates-Hangs-Out-A-Shingle-On-Harrys-Law|work=NPR|title=Kathy Bates: Storefront Lawyer On 'Harry's Law'|date=January 26, 2011|access-date=October 31, 2015|author=Conan, Neal}}</ref> In 2013, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named the film among the top 10 greatest [[List of adaptations of works by Stephen King#Film|Stephen King film adaptations]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/21/the-big-chills-10-greatest-stephen-king-movies/slide/dolores-claiborne/|magazine=Time|title=The Big Chills: 10 Greatest Stephen King Movies|author=Susman, Gary|date=October 18, 2013|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1995, Dolores Claiborne works as a domestic servant on Little Tall Island in [[Maine]]. Dolores has a struggle with her elderly, partially paralyzed employer, Vera Donovan, in her mansion. Vera falls down the staircase and Dolores ransacks the kitchen. She is caught by a mailman, who sees her standing over Vera with a [[rolling pin]], apparently intending to kill her. Vera dies and the police begin a murder investigation.\n\nDolores' daughter, Selena St. George, is a successful journalist, living in New York City, who battles depression and substance abuse. Selena arrives in town to support her mother, despite her own doubts about Dolores' innocence. Dolores insists she did not kill her employer. Selena finds little sympathy for Dolores, as the entire town believes she murdered her husband, Joe St. George, 18 years earlier. Some of the town's inhabitants harass her by vandalizing her home, taunting her in the street, and driving by her house and screaming at her. Detective John Mackey, who was the chief detective in her husband's murder case, is determined to put Dolores away for life.\n\nSelena also believes Dolores killed her father and has not seen her mother in 15 years. In 1975, Joe was an [[domestic violence|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and one night Dolores had threatened to kill him with a [[hatchet]] if he ever harmed her again. Selena, then 13 years old, was unaware her mother was being abused. Dolores went to work as a housemaid for millionaire Vera Donovan to save money to pay for Selena's education. Dolores went to the bank to withdraw her money so Selena and she could flee Joe's abuse. The plan was abandoned, however, when Dolores discovered that Joe had stolen the money from Selena's savings account.\n\nDolores says Vera threw herself down the staircase and begged Dolores to [[Assisted suicide|put her out of her misery]]. Mackey refuses to believe her, and reveals that Vera has left her entire fortune to Dolores. Mackey informs them the will is eight years old, which nearly convinces Selena her mother is guilty. Dolores eventually tells Selena that before he died, Dolores realized Joe was sexually abusing Selena when he gave her an heirloom locket. Selena has always furiously denied any abuse, and after a fierce argument, she storms out, leaving Dolores to fend for herself.\n\nBack in 1975, Dolores broke down and confessed Joe's abuses to Vera, who remained characteristically cold until Dolores mentioned that he was molesting Selena. Turning unusually sympathetic, Vera implied she killed her own late husband, Jack, who had died in a car accident in [[Maryland]], and engineered it to look like an accident. She said, \"Sometimes Dolores, sometimes you have to be a high-riding bitch to survive. Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold on to.\" Vera's confession formed a bond between the two women and convinced Dolores to take control of her situation. As a total [[solar eclipse]] approached, Dolores  was pointedly given the rest of the day off by Vera, who insinuates that she expects Dolores to use the free time to dispose of Joe, repeating her earlier statement, \"Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hang on to.\"\n\nDolores and Selena had an argument about Dolores' suspicions regarding Joe's sexual abuse. Selena fled home for the weekend to work at a hotel, where guests had flocked for the eclipse. Joe soon returned from working on a fishing boat, and Dolores offered him a bottle of Scotch to celebrate the eclipse. After Joe got drunk, Dolores revealed she knew he stole from Selena's account and molested his own daughter, then provoked him into attacking her and falling down an old well, leaving him to die as he plunges to the stone bottom.\n\nSelena hears this entire story on a tape left for her by Dolores, who had foreseen her departure. While on the ferry, Selena suddenly uncovers a [[repressed memory]] of her father forcing her to give him a [[handjob]]. Realizing everything, Selena rushes back to Dolores as she is attending the coroner's inquest. As Mackey makes a case to be sent to a [[grand jury]] in an attempt to indict Dolores for murder, Selena arrives and tells him he has no admissible evidence, he is only doing this because of his personal vendetta against Dolores, and that despite an often stormy relationship, Vera and Dolores loved each other. Realizing that the case would likely end with either a dismissal or acquittal, Mackey reluctantly drops the charges. Dolores and Selena reconcile on the ferry wharf before Selena returns to New York.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Dolores Claiborne\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Selena St. George\n** [[Ellen Muth]] as Young Selena\n** Taffara Jessica Stella Murray as 5-year-old Selena \n* [[Judy Parfitt]] as Vera Donovan\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Detective John Mackey\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Joe St. George\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Peter\n* [[John C.
