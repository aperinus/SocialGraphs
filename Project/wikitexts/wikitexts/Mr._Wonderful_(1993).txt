The problem is that he still pays [[alimony]] to his ex-wife, Leonora. Gus realizes that if Leonora remarries, he can stop paying alimony, and attempts to match Leonora with various men.\n\nLenora has several would-be suitors, including one who upsets her because he is pushy, so she goes to complain to Gus about it. Afterwards, she has him to dinner. As he is leaving, her professor boyfriend Tom shows up directly after, upsetting Gus.\n\nIn the course of his match-making, Gus' girlfriend, Rita breaks up with him on the day they were meant to move in together. She feels he's still in love with his ex. One day, his workmate describes to him how being in love makes him feel. It inspires him to find Leonora but, seeing her in the botanical garden with Dominic stops him in his tracks.\n\nA while later, on a job, Gus gets electrocuted while saving a workmate. Leonora, similarly to him, realizes she still has feelings for him when she sees him in the hospital. Rita, as she works there, is at his sleeping side, so Leonora leaves without talking to him. Once he's out, she visits him at his apartment. She had ended things with the professor, and she lets  him know Dominic asked her to marry him.\n\nIn the end, Gus and Leonora discover that they still care about each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Gus DeMarco\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Leonora DeMarco\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Rita Calley\n* [[William Hurt]] as Tom\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Dominic\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Harvey\n* [[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] as Dante\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n|Luis Guzman]] as Juice\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Kevin Klassic\n* [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Jan\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Mr. Wonderful\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Mike Crosby\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Funny Face\n* Vanessa Aspillaga as Marie, Dante's fianc\u00e9e\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title= Mr Wonderful|work= [[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 15, 1993|last=Travers|first=Peter|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/mr-wonderful-19931015|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A Story of Electricity: Men, Women and Con Ed|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=October 15, 1993|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/movies/a-story-of-electricity-men-women-and-con-ed.html|accessdate=June 9, 2012|last=Maslin|first=Janet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'Mr. Wonderful' Understands the Mating Game|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 15, 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-15/entertainment/ca-45840_1_romantic-comedy|accessdate=June 9, 2012|last=Rainer|first=Peter}}</ref> It holds a 52% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_wonderful/ |title=Mr. Wonderful (1993) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home - Cinemascore |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |website=Cinemascore |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was not a box office success.<ref>{{cite news| title=Weekend Box Office : 'Demolition Man' Fends Off 'Hillbillies'| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-19/entertainment/ca-47287_1_demolition-man| accessdate=December 30, 2010|date=October 19, 1993|last=Fox|first=David J.}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0107613|Mr. Wonderful}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|mr_wonderful|Mr. Wonderful}}\n* {{Mojo title|mrwonderful}}\n\n{{Anthony Minghella}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Anthony Minghella]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
