Astle and Matt Ember, and stars the voices of [[Jim Parsons]], [[Rihanna]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]. The story follows the shared adventures of a friendly alien who is shunned by the rest of his kind, and a teenage girl searching for her mother after they are separated during an invasion of Earth.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Boulder International Film Festival]] on March 7, 2015, and was released in theaters on March 27, 2015.<ref name=Slate2016 /> ''Home'' was promoted with the release of a four-minute short film titled ''Almost Home'', which was shown in theaters before DreamWorks Animation's ''[[Mr. Peabody & Sherman]]'' and [[Blue Sky Studios]]' ''[[Rio 2]]'' in 2014. [[Rihanna]] created a concept album [[Home (soundtrack)|of the same name]]. The soundtrack also includes guest vocals from Jennifer Lopez, among others, and was supported by two singles, \"[[Towards the Sun (song)|Towards the Sun]]\" and \"[[Feel the Light]]\". ''Home'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $386 million worldwide.\n\nA [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] [[Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh|Netflix original series]] was released on July 29, 2016, with the elements of its plot taking place after the events of the film. Of the original cast, only Matt Jones reprised his role for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--According to [[WP:FILMPLOT]], we do not make film summaries any longer than 700 words. This article is at 696. Please add nothing without removing something first.--->\nA cowardly alien race known as the Boov, led by Captain Smek, commence their \"friendly\" invasion of the planet Earth. Relocating the humans, whom the Boov deem as simple and backwards, to the [[Australian Outback]], the Boov inhabit their homes. Oh, an accident-prone, free-thinking Boov, decides to invite the other Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party, but no one comes. Meanwhile, 14-year-old<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/home-tim-johnson_n_6951448.html|title='Home' Director Tim Johnson On The Film's Immigrant Theme And Animating 'Realistic' Bodies|date=March 27, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=April 17, 2020|archive-date=May 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510082611/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/home-tim-johnson_n_6951448.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gratuity \"Tip\" Tucci and her [[Japanese Bobtail]] cat Pig drive around the city searching for Tip's mom Lucy, who was taken during the invasion.\n\nOh visits grumpy Boov [[traffic officer]] Kyle, to invite him to the party; however, Oh accidentally sends the invitation email to every alien race in the galaxy. This includes the hostile Gorg, who have been the Boov's longtime enemy ever since a failed peace meeting, during which Captain Smek stole an artifact the Boov call \"the Shusher\". Furious with Oh for revealing their new home to the Gorg, the Boov declare him a fugitive. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide, just as Tip crashes the car and enters the store in search of supplies. Tip attacks Oh on sight, and locks him in a freezer, until he promises to fix her car. He turns it into a flying craft named \"Slushious\".\n\nTo hide from the Boov, Oh promises to help Tip find Lucy. However, Oh secretly plans to abandon Tip and take himself to [[Antarctica]], the only place on Earth with no Boovs. His attempt to leave Tip in a public restroom \nis thwarted by Kyle, who arrives to force Oh to give him his email password so Smek can cancel the invitation.\n\nEscaping Kyle, Oh and Tip reach [[Paris, France|Paris]] and sneak into the Boov Command Centre. Oh cancels the invite before it reaches the Gorg; he then looks for Lucy, and the computer confirms she is in Australia. Trying to return to Slushious, Oh and Tip are cornered by Smek and many other Boov at the Great Antenna ([[Eiffel Tower]]). Smek orders Oh's execution, despite the invitation being stopped. Tip uses a Boov gravity device to turn the tower upside down, and she and Oh escape. \n\nOh informs Tip that he now believes Smek's propaganda about humans being simple and backward is wrong, and apologizes to her. They fly to Australia, but are suddenly surrounded by hundreds of Boov fleeing from Gorg [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], sent to search for them. Slushious is wrecked, but Oh finds a Gorg [[microchip|SuperChip]] in a crashed drone, and uses it to repair the car.\n\nWhen they reach the human relocation camp, Oh realizes the other Boov are evacuating, and fears that the Gorg will take vengeance on Earth when they cannot find the Boov. He tries to convince Tip to flee with them, but she refuses. Oh joins the Boov, but runs back towards the Gorg to use the SuperChip to power the Boov mothership, which then easily outpaces the Gorg. Impressed at his bravery, the other Boov listen as Oh berates Captain Smek for his lies, and the other Boov for their cowardice. Moved, Kyle takes the Shusher from a horrified Smek and decrees that Oh should be the new captain. Oh reluctantly accepts, turns the ship around, and returns to Earth. He helps Tip reunite with Lucy, fulfilling his promise.\n\nRealizing from a chance remark of Tip's that the Gorg are actually chasing the Shusher and not the Boov, Oh locks Tip and Lucy inside Slushious, and faces the approaching Gorg ship alone. Tip and Lucy escape and try to stop him. The Gorg ship hits the brakes, only just avoiding crushing Oh. He returns the Shusher, revealed to be an egg containing the entire next generation of Gorg. The lone Gorg inside the ship happily accepts the egg; being the last of his kind, he had been desperately searching for his children.\n\nAfter the Gorg leave, the Boov relocate their colony to the moon. Many Boov visit Earth and mingle with the humans, who are restored to their original homes. Oh moves in with Tip and Lucy; many other aliens, invited by Oh, come to visit earth and attend his parties.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jim Parsons]] as Oh, a Boov fugitive.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n* [[Rihanna]] as Gratuity \"Tip\" Tucci, a [[teenage]] [[girl]] who befriends Oh.<ref name=ComingSoonRihanna /><ref name=DWAHome>{{cite web|title=Home - Characters|url=http://www.dreamworks.com/home/|publisher=DreamWorks Animation|access-date=November 29, 2014|archive-date=April 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408093549/http://www.dreamworks.com/home/tw/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Captain Smek, the leader of the Boov race.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Lucy Tucci, Tip's mother.<ref name=DWAHome /><ref name=\"Martin & Lopez\">{{cite web|last=Dickey|first=Josh|title=Jennifer Lopez, Steve Martin Board DreamWorks Animation's 'Home' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.thewrap.com/steve-martin-jennifer-lopez-board-dreamworks-animations-home-exclusive/|publisher=The Wrap News Inc|access-date=October 4, 2013|date=October 3, 2013|archive-date=October 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004020938/http://www.thewrap.com/steve-martin-jennifer-lopez-board-dreamworks-animations-home-exclusive/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]] as Kyle, a Boov [[police officer]].\n* [[Brian Stepanek]] as the Gorg Commander, the leader and father of the Gorg races.\n** Stepanek also voices some Boov.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Pig, Tip's pet [[Japanese Bobtail]] (Uncredited)\nAdditionally, April Lawrence and Nigel W.
