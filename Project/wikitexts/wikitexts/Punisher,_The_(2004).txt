''The Punisher'' was shot on location in [[Tampa, Florida]] and environs in mid to late 2003. It was distributed by [[Lionsgate Films|Lions Gate Films]] in North America, although [[Artisan Entertainment]], which released a [[The Punisher (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of the same name]] on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], financed and co-distributed the film with eventual Artisan owner Lionsgate, while [[Columbia Pictures]] distributed the film in non-North American territories.<ref name=\"variety=sonypunisher\"/> Screenwriter [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] agreed to helm the film during its development stage despite a dispute with [[Marvel Studios]], marking his [[directorial debut]].\n\nThe film was released on April 16, 2004, by Lions Gate Films and [[Columbia Pictures]], grossing $13 million in the United States over its opening weekend, and reached a total gross of $54 million against a budget of $33 million. It has a 29% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1131721_punisher|title=The Punisher (2004)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=August 28, 2020}}</ref> [[Marvel Comics]] and Lionsgate began development on a sequel, ''The Punisher 2'', which instead became the 2008 reboot ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'' after Jane and Hensleigh left the project due to creative differences. This was the final film produced by Artisan Entertainment for theatrical distribution.\n\n==Plot==\nAn [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] bust of smuggling operation in [[Tampa Bay]] results in the deaths of Bobby Saint, the son of [[boss (crime)|mafia boss]] Howard Saint, and Otto Krieg, an arms dealer. However, Krieg's death was faked, and he is revealed to be undercover FBI agent Frank Castle on his final mission before retirement. Enraged at the death of his son, Saint orders his men to learn everything they can about Krieg, and acquires access by bribing [[Police corruption|corrupt federal law enforcement officers]] for his federal service history. He orders Castle killed at a [[family reunion]], though Saint's wife Livia insists that Castle's family be killed as well. At the reunion, Saint's men, including Saint's best friend Quentin Glass, and Bobby's identical twin John, kill Castle's entire family. Though Frank Castle Sr. takes down some of the attackers, John then shoots Castle, leaving him for dead. However, Castle survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman.\n\nWith the police and FBI unwilling to pursue the killers due to Saint's power and influence, Castle moves into an abandoned apartment occupied by three outcasts\u2014Joan, Bumpo, and [[Spacker Dave]]\u2014and begins his mission to bring the Saints down. With the help of information provided by [[Mickey Fondozzi|Mickey Duka]], Saint's less malevolent henchman, Castle studies the Saint family and learns their every move, during which he discovers Glass to be a [[closeted]] homosexual. He openly attacks Saint's business and sabotages his partnership with his Cuban partners.\n\nSaint discovers Castle is alive and sends assassins to kill him. The first, Harry Heck, ambushes Castle on a bridge, but is killed when Castle fires a [[ballistic knife]] into his throat. The second, a [[Russian (comics)|Russian]] behemoth, nearly beats Castle to death in his own apartment, but Castle manages to kill him as well. The tenants treat Castle's wounds and hide him in his hidden elevator as Saint's men arrive for him. When Dave and Bumpo refuse to reveal Castle's hideout, Glass tortures Dave by plucking each of his piercings with pliers. They leave one of their men to intercept Castle, but Castle kills him after they leave.\n\nWith Mickey's help, Castle poses as an anonymous blackmailer and arranges for Glass to be at certain places while planting Livia's car in the same location, and ultimately placing one of Livia's earrings in Glass's bed. When Saint finds the earrings, he stabs Glass to death and, despite her protest that Glass was gay, accuses Livia of having an affair with his best friend. He throws Livia off an overpass onto a railroad track, where she is run over by a train.\n\nWith Saint despondent, Castle assaults Saint's club and kills every member of his mob, including his remaining son John. Saint escapes the building, albeit wounded. Castle pursues him and shoots him in a duel. As Saint lies dying, Castle reveals his schemes that led Saint to kill his friend and wife. He ties Saint to a car and sends it into the club's parking lot, which is rigged with explosives, prompting a set of explosions that kills Saint, and which forms the shape of a skull when viewed from the air.\n\nCastle returns home and prepares to kill himself with his mission fulfilled, but changes his mind after seeing a vision of his wife, instead deciding to continue to fight crime. He leaves some of Saint's money as a farewell gift to the tenants for protecting him. He is then seen standing alone on the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]] at sunset, where, in a voice-over, he vows to kill all killers, rapists, psychopaths, sadists, and anyone else who harms innocent people in any way in his new identity, the [[Punisher]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as [[Punisher|Frank Castle / Punisher]]\n* [[John Travolta]] as Howard Saint\n* [[Will Patton]] as Quentin Glass\n* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as Joan\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as [[Spacker Dave]]\n* [[John Pinette]] as [[List of Punisher supporting characters#Nathaniel Bumpo|Nathaniel Bumpo]]\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as Maria Castle\n* Marcus Johns as Will Castle\n* Russell Andrews as Agent James Weeks\n* [[James Carpinello]] as Bobby Saint and John Saint\n* [[Laura Harring]] as Livia Saint\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as [[Mickey Fondozzi|Mickey Duka]]\n* [[Eduardo Y\u00e1\u00f1ez]] as Mike Toro\n* [[Omar Avila]] as Joe Toro\n* [[Kevin Nash]] as [[Russian (comics)|The Russian]]\n* [[Mark Collie]] as Harry Heck\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Frank Castle Sr.\n* Tom Nowicki as Lincoln\n* Veryl Jones as Candelaria\n* [[Marco St. John]] as Chief Morris\n* Hank Stone as Cutter\n* Rick Elmhurst as Bay News 9 Newscaster<ref name=\"bay9\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.baynews9.com/newsstory.cfm?storyid=22181|title=BayNews9.com - News|date=August 11, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811132340/http://www.baynews9.com/newsstory.cfm?storyid=22181|archive-date=August 11, 2003}}</ref>\n* [[Carleth Keys]] as Bay News 9 Newscaster<ref name=\"bay9\"/>\n}}\n\nHensleigh and Arad have said in many interviews that Jane was the first and only actor to be asked to play the title role.<ref name=slash/> Arad had previously pursued Jane for other roles in Marvel Studios films.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Brian Hiatt|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,612227,00.html|title=Jane Says|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 17, 2004|access-date= October 11, 2014}}</ref> He turned down the Punisher twice, as he did not see himself as a superhero actor.<ref name=slash>{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/punisher.HTML|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420234145/http://www.slasherama.com/features/punisher.HTML|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 20, 2016|title=Capital Punishment: The Punisher's Tom Jane tells Slasherama about his \"balls-to-the-wall, punk rock action movie\"...|publisher=Slasherama|access-date=December 18, 2008}}</ref> Jane said, when asked the second time to play the Punisher, that he became interested when Arad sent [[Tim Bradstreet]]'s artwork of the character.
