The film tells the story of a young New York City business student, Brian Flanagan, who takes up [[bartending]] in order to make ends meet. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Bryan Brown]], and [[Elisabeth Shue]].\n\nReleased on July 29, 1988, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (under its adult film label [[Touchstone Pictures]]), ''Cocktail'' features an original music score composed by [[J. Peter Robinson]]. Despite earning overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, and winning the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]], the film was a huge box office success, grossing more than $170 million worldwide against a budget of $20 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nCocky Brian Flanagan, just finished with his stint in the army, heads back to [[New York City|NYC]] and is eager to land a high-powered job in the business world. When he fails, he settles for work as a [[bartender]] while attending business school during the day. \n\nDoug Coughlin, an older and experienced bartender, takes Brian under his wing and teaches him how to [[flair bartending|flair]]. They become friends, with Doug giving Brian the idea for a nationwide chain of bars called Cocktails and Dreams. Brian drops out of business school and they become popular bartenders at a trendy nightclub. \n\nEventually, their [[flair bartending|flairing]] act catches the eye of Coral, a wealthy photographer and she and Brian begin dating. Doug bets Brian that the relationship won't last and, unbeknownst to Brian, tricks Coral into sleeping with him. After Coral breaks up with Brian, he has a nasty fight with Doug in front of a full bar and dissolves their partnership.\n\nTwo years later, Brian is working at a beachside bar in [[Jamaica]], hoping to save enough money for his own bar. He meets beautiful artist Jordan Mooney and they begin a passionate relationship. Out of the blue, Doug shows up, now married to the wealthy, flirtatious and much younger Kerry, and bets Brian that he can't attract Bonnie, a wealthy older woman. Brian accepts his challenge and wins Bonnie over. Jordan is devastated when she spots Brian and Bonnie drunkenly walking to Bonnie's hotel room. The next morning, Brian regrets the fling and seeks out Jordan, only to find she has left for the United States.\n  \nBrian returns to New York with Bonnie, hoping she will get him the corporate job he wants, but soon feels marginalized and resents her lifestyle. While attending an [[art exhibition|art exhibit]], Brian has an altercation with the artist in front of Bonnie's friends, leading them to break up. \n\nBrian tries to reconcile with Jordan, but she angrily refuses. When calmer, she reveals she is pregnant with his child and does not want him in her life because she does not want to be hurt again. After he tries again to talk to Jordan, a neighbor tells him she has moved into her parents\u2019 upscale [[Park Avenue]] apartment. Jordan's father, Richard, tries to pay Brian off, but he refuses. Jordan explains that she hid her wealth because she wanted him to love her for who she was. To illustrate how little he cares about her money, he tears up her father's check and leaves.\n\nBrian finds Doug on his new yacht and thinks he has finally achieved the financial success they both wanted. However, Doug tells him that when his business began to fail, he invested all of Kerry's money in [[Commodity market|commodities]] and lost her entire wealth.  \n\nWhen Brian takes Kerry to her apartment, she says she is bored with marriage and tries to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. He goes back to Doug's boat and finds him dead from [[suicide]]. Doug mailed in Brian\u2019s suicide note and told him that his life was a fraud.\n\nDistraught, but determined to win Jordan over, Brian tries to visit her, but is stopped by security who has been told by Jordan's father not to admit him. He fights his way up to the apartment, tells her of Doug's death and says he doesn't want to make the same mistake by being too proud to ask for help. He says his Uncle Pat has given him a loan to start his own bar and confidently predicts that he will be successful. \n\nWhen Jordan still hesitates, Brian declares his love for her, that he wants to marry her and take care of her and their child. She agrees to take him back, but Richard interferes, leading to a fight where a security guard assaults Jordan. As they leave, Richard tells them they are on their own and Brian answers that he prefers it that way.\n\nBrian and Jordan marry and he finally lives out his dream, opening his own bar, Flanagan's Cocktails and Dreams, with hopes of starting [[franchising|franchises]] across the country. At the grand opening, Jordan whispers that she is pregnant with twins. In his happiness and much to his Uncle's chagrin, he proclaims that drinks are \u201con the house\u201d and the bar is open.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Brian Flanagan\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Doug Coughlin\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Jordan Mooney\n* [[Lisa Banes]] as Bonnie\n* [[Laurence Luckinbill]] as Richard Mooney\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Kerry Coughlin\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Coral\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Uncle Pat\n* [[Ellen Foley]] as Eleanor\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Tourist\n* [[Paul Benedict]] as Finance Teacher\n* Kenneth John McGregor as Sculptor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Script===\nThe film was based on [[Heywood Gould]]'s semi-autobiographical<ref>{{cite web |first=Derek |last=Brown |title=Cocktail at 25: Heywood Gould on Tom Cruise, flair, and barman poets |url=http://tablematters.com/2013/07/05/cocktails-and-dreams/ |website=Table Matters |date=5 July 2013 | access-date=20 August 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820074802/http://tablematters.com/2013/07/05/cocktails-and-dreams/ | archive-date=20 August 2017 | url-status=dead}}</ref> novel published in 1984. Gould had worked as a bartender in New York from 1969 to 1981 to support his writing career. Gould said he \"met a lot of interesting people behind the bar and very rarely was it someone who started out wanting to be a bartender. They all had ambitions, some smoldering and some completely forgotten or suppressed.\"<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite news |first=Nina |last=Metz |title=Toss up a bottle for the author of 'Cocktail' |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-21/entertainment/ct-mov-0322-chicago-closeup-20130322_1_tom-cruise-cocktail-moral-compass |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nGould says the lead character \"is a composite of a lot of people I met, including myself in those days. I was in my late 30s, and I was drinking pretty good, and I was starting to feel like I was missing the boat. The character in the book is an older guy who has been around and starting to feel that he's pretty washed-up.\"<ref name=\"chicago\" />\n\nUniversal bought the film rights and Gould wrote the script, changing it from his novel. He says the studio put the project in turnaround \"because I wasn't making the character likable enough.\"<ref name=\"chicago\" /> Disney picked up the project \"and I went through the same process with them. I would fight them at every turn, and there was a huge battle over making the lead younger, which I eventually did.\"<ref name=\"chicago\" />\n\nGould later admitted that the people who wanted him to make changes \"were correct. They wanted movie characters. Characters who were upbeat and who were going to have a happy ending and a possible future in their lives. That's what you want for a big commercial Hollywood movie. So I tried to walk that thin line between giving them what they wanted and not completely betraying the whole arena of saloons in general.\"<ref name=\"chicago\" />\n\n[[Tom Cruise]] expressed interest in playing the role, which helped get it financed.\n\n\"There were a lot of bartenders around like Tom Cruise, younger guys who came on and were doing this for a while\u2014and then 10 years later, still doing it,\" said Gould. \"It wasn't as if I was betraying the character. It was a matter of making the character more idealistic, more hopeful\u2014he's got his life ahead of him. He turns on the charm, without the cynical bitter edge of the older guys.\"<ref name=\"chicago\" />\n\nBryan Brown later said the original script \"was one of the very best screenplays I had ever read. Very dark... about the cult of celebrity and everything about it.... Tom Cruise is a very sweet man, he was then and still is. But when Tom came in, the movie had to change. The studio made the changes to protect the star and it became a much slighter movie because of it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houseofparadox.com.au/filmblog/film-an-interview-with-bryan-brown.html |title=Film: AN INTERVIEW WITH BRYAN BROWN |access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317020458/http://www.houseofparadox.com.au/filmblog/film-an-interview-with-bryan-brown.html|archive-date=17 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nBryan Brown was cast on the strength of his performance in ''[[F/X (film)|F/X]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviefanatic.com/2012/06/cocktail-exclusive-director-roger-donaldson-on-blu-ray-debut/#ixzz2aMnSBgDf |title=Cocktail Exclusive: Director Roger Donaldson on Blu-Ray Debut |date=5 June 2012 |access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nGould says the tricks involving throwing bottles was not in the book, but something he showed Cruise and Bryan Brown.
