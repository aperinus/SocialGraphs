Retrieved on August 26, 2020.</ref> future, [[Detroit]] is close to bankruptcy after failing to pay off its debts to conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP). The OCP chairman intends to have the city [[Default (finance)|default]] on its debt, then [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on all public property, effectively taking over its government and allowing for OCP's on-going, radical urban-redevelopment plan (as established in the first film). To rally public opinion behind the project, OCP sparks an increase in street crime by terminating the privatized [[Detroit Police Department]]'s pension plans and cutting salaries, triggering a police strike.\n\n[[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] remains on duty with his partner, Anne Lewis. They raid a manufacturing plant of Nuke, a new [[designer drug]] plaguing Detroit. The cartel's leader Cain and his prepubescent accomplice Hob escape. RoboCop has flashbacks to his previous life as Alex Murphy, and has begun watching his wife and son outside their home. Still grieving over the death of her husband, his wife brings litigation against OCP, complaining of harassment. After his handlers dress him down, RoboCop tells his wife that Murphy is dead.\n\nOCP struggles to develop RoboCop 2, a police droid fitted with the brains of [[Legal death|legally-dead]] police officers, intended for mass production to replace the striking police force. The resurrected cops keep committing suicide upon activation. Morally-warped psychologist Dr. Juliette Faxx theorizes that Murphy's strong moral code and strict Catholic upbringing were critical in his initial success; she convinces the Chairman to let her lead the project to recover their 90-million dollar [[research and development]] investment. The research staff are later horrified to learn that she seeks to use [[death row]] inmates, who desire power and immortality, rather than police officers.\n\nCain fears losing his grip after the Delta City project, and uses corrupt police officer Duffy to undermine OCP and RoboCop's enforcement efforts. RoboCop tracks down Duffy and violently confronts him, revealing Cain's hideout. He confronts Cain's gang at an abandoned construction site, but he walks into a trap and is overwhelmed. The criminals cut apart RoboCop's body and dump the pieces in front of his precinct. Cain has Duffy [[Vivisection|vivisected]] for revealing their location and encourages Hob to watch.\n\nRoboCop is repaired, but Faxx intentionally reprograms him with new and softer directives with the approval of the OCP Board of Directors that severely impede his ability to perform his duties so that her project can be selected. RoboCop eventually clears these by shocking himself with a high voltage transformer and rebooting his system. Murphy motivates the striking officers to aid him in raiding Cain's hideout. As Cain tries to escape, RoboCop wounds and apprehends him. Hob escapes and takes control of Cain's drug empire. Believing she can control Cain via his Nuke addiction, Faxx selects him for the RoboCop 2 project and disconnects his life support. Surgeons place his brain in a heavily armed robotic body, similar to [[ED-209]], and reactivate him.\n\nAfter failing to pay the city's debts via voluntary [[fundraising]], the Mayor is contacted by Hob, who offers to retire the city's entire debt in exchange for a \"hands off\" policy towards Nuke, thereby nullifying OCP's scheme and preventing Delta City's construction. Threatened by this move, OCP sends Cain to the meeting. Cain slaughters everyone but the mayor, who escapes. RoboCop arrives to find a wounded Hob, who identifies the attacker before dying.\n\nThe chairman presents an unveiling ceremony for Cain and Delta City, their redevelopment plan. When he presents a canister of Nuke, Cain's uncontrollable addiction causes him to disobey his programming and murder many civilians and police officers. RoboCop arrives and fights Cain, and their battle extends to the street. RoboCop recovers the Nuke canister and Lewis uses it to distract Cain. RoboCop leaps onto his back, shoots through his armor, rips out his brain and smashes it onto the ground, ending Cain's rampage. The Chairman and Johnson decide to use Dr. Faxx as the scapegoat for Cain's attack. As Lewis complains that OCP is going to avoid accountability again, RoboCop insists they must be patient because \"we're only human\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Peter Weller]] as [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy / RoboCop]]\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Officer Anne Lewis\n* [[Belinda Bauer (actress)|Belinda Bauer]] as Dr. Juliette Faxx\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as \"The Old Man\" OCP President\n* [[Felton Perry]] as Donald Johnson\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as Cain\n* [[Willard E.

As a result of a five-month Writer's Guild strike and a difficulty to agree with Orion on a story, he and Michael Miner were fired from the project.]]\n''RoboCop'' screenwriters [[Edward Neumeier]] and Michael Miner started drafting a sequel in September 1987 per strong demand by Orion which imposed a deadline of December 31, 1987.{{sfn|Persons|1990|pp=20, 24}} Neumeir and Miner rushed the screenplay as they were also simultaneously writing for another Orion project, ''Company Man''; a film about the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s involvement in the [[Contras]], it was planned to be directed by [[Oliver Stone]], star [[Paul Newman]], and released before the [[1988 United States presidential election|next United States election]].{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=24\u201325}}\n\nNeumeier and Miner's draft, ''RoboCop 2: The Corporate Wars'', is set 25 years after RoboCop, trying to stop a bank-robbery, is blown up by a thief. The titular protagonist wakes up in a new United States named AmeriPlex, consisting of upper-class \"plexes\" made out of former cities (i.e. NewYorkPlex, RioPlex, DelhiPlex) and many more [[shantytown]]s with residents named OutPlexers.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=20}} He is revived in a now-abandoned building for the defunct Omni-Consumer Products by two goons of a \"super-entrepreneur\" named Ted Flicker,{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}} who plans to make the national government a private corporate entity he owns.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}} Flicker also currently has a lot of control over the country, despite another person (who was a former comedian) being the president.{{sfn|Persons|1990|pp=20\u201321}} RoboCop's new system is also the central computer system of AmeriPlex, NeuroBrain.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}}\n\n''RoboCop 2'' follows numerous subplots, such as Flicker's plan for domination, a violence-spreading narcotic named Smudge, the Internal Grid Security commander trying to commit genocide against the OutPlexers, and RoboCop's code being played with by an American scientist and a Chinese hacker.{{sfn|Persons|1990|pp=20\u201321}} The script expands upon the first film's consumerist aspects; those in the high-class city plexes eat at LeisureGold where ServiceDroids serve them and make love with SexBots at various brothels; while the environment's media landscape is filled with \"NewsBlips,\" mood-enhancing drugs ads, and MoonDog, a rapper from space, changing public opinion.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}}\n\nOn March 7, 1988, a five-month [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike began]], and its length resulted in Neumeier and Miner being fired from the project for breach of contract.{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} Additionally, the writers and Orion struggled to agree on a story, with the studio turned off by the gritty parts of Neumeier and Miner's draft.{{sfn|Persons|1990|pp=19\u201320}} Stone also stopped ''Company Man'' to work on ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'' (1988), making Neumeier and Miner no longer involved at Orion.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=25}}\n\n=== 1988\u20131989: Frank Miller's ''RoboCop 2'' ===\n[[File:Frank Miller.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Frank Miller]] in 1982. His script for ''RoboCop 2'' went through four drafts, and he later used an early treatment for a comic book series.]]\n\nIn order for a sequel to still be possible, Orion had to sign a [[waiver]] to develop other ''RoboCop'' scripts, and, before he was fired, Neumeier recommended two popular comic book authors and artists to write them: [[Alan Moore]] and [[Frank Miller]].{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} Although Moore rejected the offer under the reason of \"I don't do movies,\" Miller accepted and started writing his own script,{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} which went through four drafts.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=20}} Davison hired Miller through his company Tobor Pictures initially to write ''RoboCop 3'', only for the comic book author to write ''RoboCop 2'' after Miner and Neumeier's firing.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=25}} Miller, a year before the original film's release, became popular for his [[The Dark Knight Returns|edgy, \"tragic hero\" take on the]] [[Batman]] character, a style also suited for [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]].{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}}\n\nThough there are no reports of Miller taking influence from ''The Corporate Wars'', both drafts share multiple traits: they begin their plots during the holiday season, follow a battle between corporations and poor citizens, depict an entrepreneur trying to buy governments (for Miller's screenplay, a city's government instead of a country's), have Asian hackers as RoboCop's sidekick (in Miller's case, a Japanese teenager named Keiko McFarland), and have a violence-causing drug selling throughout society.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=20}}\n\nMiller's first draft was less comic and had a bigger emphasis on [[corporate fascism]] than the final film, with the last showdown pitting RoboCop against OCP forces instead of RoboCop 2.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}} It was enjoyed by Davison for its grittiness, \"inventive action,\" humor, and politics; however, Orion rejected it as \"unfilmable\" and brought in a screenwriter of the violent western film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), [[Walon Green]], to re-write it.{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} Cut material included backstories for Anne Lewis and the marriage between Alex Murphy and his wife Ellen.{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=122}} Miller later used his treatment as the story of [[Frank Miller's RoboCop|his own series of ''RoboCop'' comics published in the 2000s]].{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}}\n\n=== Development ===\n''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987) producer [[Jon Davison (film producer)|Jon Davison]] was skeptical about doing a sequel to ''RoboCop''. He had a negative opinion on sequel films, finding most of them worse than their predecessors and disliking not being able to make a different movie in order to produce another product audiences of the first film were used to.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=22}}  Additionally, he was in a dilemma between producing a second ''RoboCop'' film and [[Warren Beatty]]'s [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|screen adaptation of the]] ''[[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]]'' comics; he chose to do ''RoboCop 2'', as \"''RoboCop'' is my movie and ''Dick Tracy'' is more Warren's movie\".{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21\u201322}} [[Paul Verhoeven]] did not return as he was working on ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990).{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} [[RoboCop#Development|As with the first film]], multiple directors rejected offers from Davison to direct ''RoboCop 2'', although for different reasons; Davison reported potentials either concerned about following up Verhoeven's directing or not wanting to direct a sequel film.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=22}} [[Alex Cox]], for one week, was interested in the project, only to have a viewing of [[Exorcist II: The Heretic|the sequel to]] ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) change his decision.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=22}}\n\nDavison first hired his friend [[Tim Hunter (director)|Tim Hunter]], most known for ''[[River's Edge]]'' (1986), to direct ''RoboCop 2'', citing his \"realistic tone with actors\" and \"real dark sensibility\" as reasons.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=22}} However, Hunter's vision of an entirely dark product like the first film was at odds with Miller's intention of a dark yet humorous film, leading to a tonally unfocused script{{Sfn|Johnson|1990b|p=46}} by June 1989, 11 weeks before filming started and when Hunter left the project.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=23}}{{Sfn|Johnson|1990b|p=46}}{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} He was replaced by [[Irvin Kershner]], who previously experienced taking over the director's chair in a film series with the ''[[Star Wars]]'' sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=119}} Kershner luckily had the same goals as Miller, but Davison, earlier in development, made a requirement for a replacement director to not change the screenplay once shooting started; however, given the very close deadline to begin filming and the messy state of the script, Kershner had no choice but to work with Miller during filming, as well as editing, to tidy up the screenplay.{{Sfn|Johnson|1990b|pp=46\u201347}} Miller rejected other work offers to do this.{{Sfn|Johnson|1990b|p=47}} Kershner's biggest addition was dialogue, as it was part of Miller's writing to be sparse with it;{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=21}} and he also threw out additional scenes written by Green for reasons of Kershner and Miller already re-working the script.{{Sfn|Johnson|1990b|p=47}}\n\n[[Orion Pictures]] was far more dictatorial with ''RoboCop 2'' than the [[RoboCop|1987 first film]], strongly going against input from Miller, Kershner, and the actors; and scheduling a release date before the story was completed, resulting in a rushed production.{{sfn|Kelly|2014|p=122}}{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=19}}{{sfn|Johnson|1990b|p=46}} Neumeir and Miner reported this activity going on, claiming Orion controlled the material based on business decisions rather than creativity.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=22}} According to Weller, the film did not have a proper [[third act]] as Orion thought \"the monster's going to be enough.\"{{sfn|Kelly|2014|pp=122\u2013123}} The planned released date was originally Christmas 1989 before being moved to an early summer date.{{sfn|Persons|1990|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nInitially, Orion was skeptical of casting Weller, under the reasoning that the audience would find RoboCop the same if another actor was under the helmet, similar to the titular character of Universal's ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]''.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=19}} Weller himself was also skeptical coming back; he disliked Neumeier and Miner's draft as a \"cartoon\" and lacking in tension, felt not \"complete with the character\" thinking \"there was something else to say with it,\" and wondered if he should do months of training for acting in a RoboCop suit or get paid for filming in the Caribbean for ten weeks.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=19}} Ultimately, Weller returned for Miller and Green's new screenplay,{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=19}} and the fact that he would again work with mime Moni Yakim, who [[RoboCop#Casting|developed RoboCop movements for Weller in the first film]]; he praised him as the \"magic element\" to solve all of a crew's problems.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=18}} Additionally, Russell Towery returned as Weller's stunt double, with Weller more dependent on him than the first movie.{{sfn|Persons|1990|p=19}}\n\nAllen, despite already having played a cop character in the first RoboCop, still made preparations for shooting ''RoboCop 2''; she learned martial arts and spent two months of training at a Los Angeles police academy.{{Sfn|Johnson|1990a|p=48}} Although Cain was originally planned to be a typical professionally-suited drug dealer, his actor, Tom Noonan, came up with the character being a former hippie, with the actor using his experience as one in the 1960s.{{Sfn|Counts|1990|p=45}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n''RoboCop 2'' was chiefly filmed in [[Houston]].<ref name=\"Westbrook\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_711337 |title='RoboCop 2' creators give city rave reviews |last=Westbrook |first=Bruce |date=1990-06-22 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |access-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021011102/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_711337 |archive-date=2012-10-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_750447 |title='Gremlins' sequel better than the original film |last=Westbrook |first=Bruce |date=1990-12-14 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |access-date=2011-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021011109/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_750447 |archive-date=2012-10-21 }}</ref> Kershner mentioned that Houston was an ideal location due to the relative calmness of [[Downtown Houston]] at night.
