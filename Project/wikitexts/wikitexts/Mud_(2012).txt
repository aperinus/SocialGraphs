In the film [[Tye Sheridan]] and [[Jacob Lofland]] portray a pair of teenagers who encounter the eponymous Mud ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), a fugitive hiding on a small island, and agree to help him evade his pursuers. [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] also star.\n\n''Mud'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and was also shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2013. It opened on April 26, 2013 with a [[limited release]] in select theaters, before having a wide release on May 10. ''Mud'' performed well at the box office, grossing $32.6 million on a $10 million budget, and received critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nEllis and Neckbone, two teenage boys living in the [[DeWitt, Arkansas|DeWitt]], [[Arkansas]] area, find a boat stuck on a small island in the [[Mississippi River]]. They meet the occupant, a man named Mud, who claims to have grown up nearby. Mud tells the boys that he needs food. Mud promises that in exchange for their help, they can have the boat after he's gone.\n\nReturning with food, the boys ask Mud why he is hiding out. Mud is waiting for his girlfriend Juniper, whom he describes as beautiful with [[nightingale]] tattoos on her hands. They later spot Juniper in town. Ellis falls for a high-school girl named May Pearl.\n\nEllis learns that his parents are heading for divorce. This threatens their old river [[houseboat]]: if no longer used as a residence by the owner, it will be removed by the River Authority. Later, at a roadblock, Ellis finds out Mud is a fugitive but denies having seen him.\n\nEllis and Neckbone confront Mud over the discovery. Mud explains that he killed a man who had gotten Juniper pregnant and pushed her down a flight of stairs, causing her to lose the child. The boys decide to help Mud in exchange for his pistol.\n\nMud sends Ellis to Tom Blankenship,<ref>In his autobiography, Mark Twain identifies his childhood friend Tom Blankenship as the inspiration for his character Huckleberry Finn.</ref> an older father figure from his childhood, for help. Tom agrees to come talk to Mud; however, upon learning Mud is in trouble over Juniper again, he refuses to help. Mud gives the boys a note for Juniper. They find her motel room where Carver - the brother of the man Mud killed - is abusing her. Ellis charges at the man but is quickly overpowered. Neckbone and Ellis tell Mud about the man. Mud realizes that the family of the man he killed is here for revenge.\n\nCarver, his father King, and a handful of bounty hunters stake out Juniper's motel. They have paid off officers in local and state police.\n\nStealing machine parts and an outboard motor from junkyards, the boys help Mud repair the boat. They plan to reunite Juniper with Mud. They relay the plan to Juniper, who agrees to it. However, she instead heads to a bar and flirts with other men. Ellis and Neckbone tell Mud.\n\nEllis brings a note from Mud to Juniper, telling her it's over between them. Juniper tells Ellis that Mud is a born liar and she's sick of running away with him. Ellis is dejected, not only because he thought he was helping a couple in love, but furthered by May Pearl's rejection of him in front of her friends and not returning his calls.\n\nEllis confronts Mud and calls him a liar and a coward, and that he turned them into thieves. Running away, Ellis falls into a pit containing [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouths]] and is bitten. Mud jumps in and rescues Ellis. Mud races to get the unconscious Ellis to a clinic on the mainland. Recognizing Mud, one of the hospital employees calls the police, who tip off Carver.\n\nEvading his pursuers, Mud gets back to the island where he and Neckbone get the repaired boat into the water. As they agreed before, Mud gives Neckbone a [[M1911 pistol|pistol]] but without ammunition. Mud wants to say good-bye to Ellis, so Neckbone takes him to the houseboat where he is recovering. While Mud is in Ellis' room, Carver and his posse arrive and start shooting. Tom fires from his boat using his old [[sniper rifle]], killing several attackers from across the river. Mud saves Ellis and tries to get away but is shot as he dives into the river. The police arrive and find all the posse members dead. One trooper calls King to tell him that his other son is now dead. The morning after the shootout, Tom disappears.\n\nEllis's parents separate. He and his mother move to an apartment in town and their houseboat is demolished, while his father gets a new job far away. He tells Ellis to take care of his mother as he departs, showing a more mature & changed attitude toward their situation. Before he leaves, he tells Ellis, \"I love you\" to which Ellis replies, \"I love you too.\" Ellis sees some attractive older teenage girls in his new neighborhood and smiles. He is uncertain of Mud's fate, but still believes he was protecting Juniper.\n\nMud is revealed to be alive and recovering on the repaired boat driven by Tom. Many days have passed, and the film ends with them looking ahead at the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], and south of that, the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Mud\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Juniper\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Ellis\n* [[Jacob Lofland]] as Neckbone\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Tom Blankenship\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Senior\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Mary Lee\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Galen\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as King\n* [[Paul Sparks]] as Carver\n* Bonnie Sturdivant as May Pearl\n* [[Stuart Greer]] as Miller\n\n==Production==\n[[Jeff Nichols]] wrote and directed ''Mud'', which was fully financed by Everest Entertainment and produced by Everest and FilmNation Entertainment.<ref name=\"mcnary\">{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | title=Lionsgate, Roadside warm 'Mud' for U.S. | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 16, 2012 }}</ref> Nichols came up with the concept for the film in the 1990s.
