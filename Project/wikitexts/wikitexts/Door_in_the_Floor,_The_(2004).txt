The screenplay is based on the first third of the 1998 novel ''[[A Widow for One Year]]'' by [[John Irving]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in an exclusive beach community on [[Long Island]], where children's book author and artist Ted Cole lives with his wife Marion and their young daughter Ruth, usually supervised by her nanny Alice. Their walls are covered with photographs of the couple's teenage sons, who were killed in an automobile accident, which left Marion deeply depressed and the marriage in a shambles. The one shared experience that holds them together is Ruth's ritualistic daily viewing of a home gallery of the deceased sons.\n \nTed and Marion temporarily separate, each alternately living in the house and in a rented apartment in town. Ted hires Eddie O'Hare to work as his summer assistant and driver, since his own license was suspended for drunk driving.\n\nAn aspiring writer, Eddie admires Ted, but he soon finds the older man to be a self-absorbed womanizer with an erratic work schedule, leaving the young assistant to fill his time as best he can. Eddie and Marion soon get involved, which seems not to bother Ted, who enjoys trysts of his own with local resident Evelyn Vaughn ([[Mimi Rogers]]) while sketching her. When Ruth catches Eddie and her mother having sex, Ted becomes upset and advises Eddie he may have to testify about the incident if Ted needs to fight for [[Child custody|custody]].\n\nMarion eventually leaves Ted and their daughter, taking with her all the photographs and negatives of their dead sons, except for the one being reframed after it was broken, injuring Ruth. Eddie takes the initiative to retrieve the picture so that Ruth can have at least one partial image of her brothers.\n\nTed tells Eddie the story of the car accident that killed his sons. He suggests his and Marion's drunkenness and Ted's failure to remove snow from the tail and turn signal lights likely contributed to their sons' deaths. He gives vivid detail, to help Eddie understand Marion's intense despair. Ted does not fully comprehend why Marion left, repeating, \"What kind of mother leaves her daughter?\"\n\nAt the end of the story, while playing squash alone on his court, Ted stops, looks into the camera with resignation, then lifts the door in the floor and descends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Ted Cole \n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Marion Cole \n* [[Jon Foster]] as Eddie O'Hare\n* [[Bijou Phillips]] as Alice\n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Ruth Cole \n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Evelyn Vaughn\n* [[Robert LuPone]] as Mendelssohn\n* [[Donna Murphy]] as Frame Shop Owner\n* [[John Rothman]] as Minty O'Hare \n* Harvey Loomis as Dr. Loomis\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn reference to her sex scene with 18-year-old [[Jon Foster]], [[Kim Basinger]] said she was concerned because of the actor's age. \"I'm so fond of him and protective of him which is just the opposite to most of these situations because usually I've worked with men who are very protective of me. So this was quite the reverse. But Jon was a trooper, just a lovely guy,\" Basinger said.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 21, 2004 |title=Basinger bares all for sake of Floor |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/486940843/ |url-access=registration |access-date=9 February 2022 |work=[[Calgary Herald]] |via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nTalking about her full frontal nude scene at 48, Mimi Rogers admitted it was \"a little scary,\" but once she worked out all the particulars with helmer Tod Williams, the clothes came right off.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mimi Rogers 'Full on Starkers' in New Movie |url=https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/mimi-rogers-full-starkers-new-movie-15949/ |access-date=5 August 2022 |work=www.backstage.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 144 reviews, and an average rating of 6.46/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though uneven in tone, this is one of the better adaptations of John Irving's novels, with Jeff Bridges giving one of his best performances.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/door_in_the_floor|title=The Door in the Floor (2004)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=May 21, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-door-in-the-floor |title=The Door in the Floor Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"surely the best movie yet made from Mr. Irving's fiction\" and added, \"It may even belong in the rarefied company of movies that are better than the books on which they are based . . . If you examine the story closely, you can find soft spots of implausibility and clich\u00e9. But the shakiness of some of the film's central ideas . . . matters far less than it might . . . ''The Door in the Floor'' nimbly shifts between [[melodrama]] and comedy, with a delightful and perfectly executed excursion into high [[farce]] near the end, and it seems perpetually to be discovering new possibilities for its characters . . . Mr. Foster and Ms. Basinger are both very good, but the film is dominated by Mr. Bridges' performance . . . [He] not only dominates the movie, he animates it. He is heroically life-size.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = Film Review; Coming to Terms With an Idol Who's Deeply in Love With His Own Feet of Clay |first = A. O. |last = Scott |author-link = A. O.

But Williams is a talent to watch and a wonder with the actors. Basinger's haunted beauty burns in the memory \u2013 this is her finest work.

There are no obvious ructions yet it bristles with small riddles and puzzling inconsistencies . . . The chemistry is absurd and tragic.
