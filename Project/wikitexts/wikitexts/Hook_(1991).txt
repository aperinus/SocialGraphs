Hart]] and [[Malia Scotch Marmo]]. It stars [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain Hook]], [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]], [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee]], and [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]]. It acts as a sequel of sorts to [[J. M. Barrie]]'s  1911 novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''  focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten all about his childhood. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but unimaginative and workaholic lawyer with a wife (Wendy's granddaughter) and two children. However, when Captain Hook, the enemy of his past, kidnaps his children, he returns to [[Neverland]] to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and becomes a better person.\n\nSpielberg began developing ''Hook'' in the early 1980s with [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], which would have followed the Peter Pan storyline seen in the 1924 [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|silent film]] and 1953 [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|animated Disney film]]. It entered [[pre-production]] in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. Hart developed the script with director [[Nick Castle]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on [[sound stage]]s at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]].\n\nReleased on December 11, 1991, ''Hook'' received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances (particularly those of Robin Williams and Hoffman), John Williams' musical score, and production values, but criticized the screenplay and tone. Although it was a commercial success, its box office take was lower than expected. Despite its five nominations at the [[64th Academy Awards]], Spielberg came to be disappointed with ''Hook''. Nevertheless, it has gained a strong [[cult following]] since its release, and spawned merchandise, including [[#Video games|video games]], [[action figures]], and comic book adaptations.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nSuccessful [[San Francisco]] [[corporate lawyer]] Peter Banning is a [[workaholic]], straining his relationship with his wife Moira and their children Jack and Maggie. After promising to attend at least one of Jack's baseball games, but missing the last game of the season, Peter flies with his disappointed family to [[London]] to visit Moira's grandmother, [[Wendy Darling]]. In London, Peter, Moira and Wendy attend a charity dinner in Wendy's honor at the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], leaving the children with Wendy's old friend [[Tootles]] and housekeeper Liza. After returning, they find the house burglarized and the children missing, along with a ransom note signed by [[Captain Hook|Captain James Hook]]. Peter involves the authorities, but they are unable to help, and Wendy insists that only he can save Jack and Maggie, as he is really [[Peter Pan]]; Peter refuses to believe her. \n\nLater, in the nursery, he encounters [[Tinker Bell]], who brings him to [[Neverland]]. She drops Peter into Hook's pirate haven, where he reveals himself to [[Mr. Smee|Smee]] and Hook. Surprised to see how weak and old Peter has become, Hook challenges him to fly and rescue his children, preparing to execute him when he fails. Tinker Bell intervenes and persuades Hook to release Peter instead, promising to train him for battle over the next three days and give him the fight he desires. Peter is then taken to the hideout of the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]], now led by Rufio. The boys mock Peter, but eventually recognize and train him, encouraging him to use the power of imagination to help restore his memory and abilities. One boy, Thud Butt, gives Peter an old bag of marbles belonging to former Lost Boy Tootles.\n\nMeanwhile, Hook laments that he will not have true revenge on Peter, until Smee suggests they manipulate the Banning children into switching sides. This plan fails with Maggie, but Jack is swayed due to Peter's repeated broken promises. Dismayed to see Jack treating Hook as a father figure, Peter returns to the Lost Boys' camp with renewed determination. After seeing his shadow move independently, Peter follows it and discovers the original treehouse where Wendy and her brothers once stayed. Inside, Tinker Bell helps Peter remember how he was lost as an infant in the early 1900s, brought by her to Neverland, had many adventures, and first met the Darlings. He also recalls frequently visiting Wendy after the Darlings returned to London, until Wendy grew too old to go back. Although heartbroken, Peter then fell in love with Wendy's granddaughter Moira and chose to stay, due to his desire to become a father. He became adopted by the Bannings, but at the cost of his memories.\n\nRecalling Jack's birth is the strong, happy thought that restores Peter's ability to fly, bringing him back as Peter Pan. Rufio turns his sword over to Peter in reverence and the Lost Boys celebrate. That night, Tinker Bell professes her love for Peter with a kiss. However, Peter still chooses his family and professes his love for Moira. Although heartbroken by his rejection, Tinker Bell accepts this and encourages him to go save his children.\n\nThe next day, Peter and the Lost Boys fight Hook and his pirates while Jack watches. Hook's crew eventually surrenders, but Rufio duels Hook and is fatally wounded. With his dying breath, Rufio wishes he could have had a father like Peter. Jack comes to his senses and reconciles with his father. In the ensuing fight, Peter defeats Hook, who is devoured by the reanimated corpse of the [[Taxidermy|taxidermied]] [[Characters of Peter Pan#Other characters|Crocodile]]. Tinker Bell takes Jack and Maggie back to London, and Peter appoints Thud Butt as his successor.\n\nPeter awakens in [[Kensington Gardens]]. Tinker Bell appears and bids a tearful farewell to Peter before departing. Reuniting with his family at Wendy's house, Peter decides to devote more time to them. He also returns Tootles' bag of marbles; Tootles joyfully sprinkles himself with pixie dust from it and flies away. As Peter and his family watch Tootles return to Neverland, Wendy remarks that their adventures are truly over; Peter counters that \"to live would be an awfully big adventure\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Peter Pan|Peter Banning / Peter Pan]]\n** Ryan Francis as preteen Peter Pan\n** Max Hoffman as young Peter Pan\n** Matthew Van Ginkel as baby Peter Pan\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Captain Hook]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Tinker Bell]]\n** [[Lisa Wilhoit]] as Tinker Bell in a flashback in which Peter is a baby\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Mr. Smee|Smee]] / Sweeper in Kensington Gardens\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Wendy Darling|Granny Wendy]] \n** [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as teenage Wendy Darling\n*[[Charlie Korsmo]] as Jack Banning, Peter and Moira's son\n*Amber Scott as Maggie Banning, Peter and Moira's daughter\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Moira Banning, Peter's wife and Jack and Maggie's mother\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Rufio\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Ace\n* Raushan Hammond as Thud Butt\n* Isaiah Robinson as Pockets\n* [[James Madio]] as Don't Ask\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Tootles\n* [[Laurel Cronin]] as Liza, Granny Wendy's maid\n* [[Phil Collins]] as Inspector Good\n* Thomas Tulak as Too Small\n* Alex Zuckerman as Latchboy\n* Ahmad Stoner as No Nap\n\nIn addition, a number of celebrities and family members made brief credited and uncredited cameos in the film:<ref name=Cameos>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/the-boy-who-inspired-hook-and-19-more-facts-as-film-turns-25-photos/ |title=The Boy Who Inspired 'Hook' and 19 Other Little-Known Facts as Film Turns 25 (Photos) |last=Doty |first=Meriah |date=December 11, 2016 |website=[[TheWrap]] |access-date=October 12, 2018 |archive-date=October 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011214502/https://www.thewrap.com/the-boy-who-inspired-hook-and-19-more-facts-as-film-turns-25-photos/ |url-status=live }}</ref> musicians [[David Crosby]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominated]] actress [[Glenn Close]], and former boxer [[Tony Burton]] appear as members of Hook's pirate crew; [[Star Wars]] director [[George Lucas]] and actress [[Carrie Fisher]], play the kissing couple sprinkled with [[pixie dust]]; two of Hoffman's children, [[Jake Hoffman (actor)|Jacob]] and Rebecca, both under 10-years-old during filming, briefly appeared in scenes in the \"normal\" world; and screenwriter [[James V. Hart|Jim Hart]]'s 11-year-old son Jake (who years earlier inspired his father with the question, \"What if Peter Pan grew up?\") plays one of Pan's Lost Boys.\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration===\nSpielberg found a close personal connection to Peter Pan's story from his own childhood. The troubled relationship between Peter and Jack in the film echoed Spielberg's relationship with his own father. Previous Spielberg films that explored a dysfunctional father-son relationship included ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Peter's \"quest for success\" paralleled Spielberg starting out as a [[film director]] and transforming into a Hollywood [[business magnate]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=413}} \"I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work-driven. They are so self-involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental. I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I've not seen my kids except on weekends. They ask for my time and I can't give it to them because I'm working.\"<ref name=beetle/> Like Peter at the beginning of the film, Spielberg has a [[fear of flying]]. He feels that Peter's \"enduring quality\" in the storyline is simply to fly. \"Anytime anything flies, whether it's [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or E.T., it's got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan,\" Spielberg reflected in a 1992 interview. \"''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' was the first time I saw anybody fly. Before I saw Superman, before I saw Batman, and of course before I saw any [[superhero]]es, my first memory of anybody flying is in ''Peter Pan''.\"<ref name=beetle/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe genesis of the film started when Spielberg's mother often read him ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' as a [[bedtime story]]. He explained in 1985 \"When I was 11 years old I actually directed the story during a school production. I have always felt like Peter Pan. I still feel like Peter Pan. It has been very hard for me to grow up, I'm a victim of the [[The Peter Pan Syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]].\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=42\u20133}}\n\nIn the early 1980s, Spielberg began to develop a film with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] that would have closely followed the storyline of the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|1924 silent film]] and [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|1953 animated film]].<ref name=beetle>{{cite interview|interviewer=Ana Maria Bahiana|subject=Steven Spielberg|url=https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1992marno087|publication-date=March\u2013April 1992|title=Hook: Steven Spielberg|issue=87|magazine=[[Cinema Papers]]|pages=12\u201316|via=[[issuu]]|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-date=2021-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210512031236/https://issuu.com/libuow/docs/cinemapaper1992marno087|url-status=live}}</ref> He also considered directing it as a musical with [[Michael Jackson]] in the lead.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=409}} Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|title=Michael Jackson Was Steven Spielberg's First Choice To Play Peter Pan In 'Hook'|website=Starpulse.com|access-date=March 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143650/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/12/04/michael_jackson_was_steven_spielbergs_|archive-date=February 8, 2012}}</ref> The project was taken to [[Paramount Pictures]],<ref>{{cite web |date=December 11, 2019 |title=Steven Spielberg's Hook: What Went Wrong? |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/steven-spielbergs-hook-what-went-wrong/ |url-status=live |access-date=December 21, 2021 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |language=en-US}}</ref> where [[James V.

Hart began to work on a new storyline when his son, Jake, showed his family a drawing. \"We asked Jake what it was and he said it was a crocodile eating Captain Hook, but that the crocodile really didn't eat him, he got away,\" Hart reflected. \"As it happens, I had been trying to crack ''Peter Pan'' for years, but I didn't just want to do a remake. So I went, 'Wow. Hook is not dead. The crocodile is. We've all been fooled'. In 1986 our family was having dinner and Jake said, 'Daddy, did Peter Pan ever grow up?' My immediate response was, 'No, of course not'. And Jake said, 'But what if he did?' I realized that Peter did grow up, just like all of us [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boomers]] who are now in our forties.
