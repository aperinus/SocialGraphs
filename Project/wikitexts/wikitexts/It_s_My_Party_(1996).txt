Stein's actual farewell party was held in 1992.\n\nThe cast includes [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Bronson Pinchot]], [[Devon Gummersall]], [[George Segal]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Marlee Matlin]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Steve Antin]], [[Bruce Davison]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Lou Liberatore]], [[Nina Foch]], [[Eric Roberts]] as Nick Stark and [[Gregory Harrison]] as Brandon, Stark's estranged lover who returns to attend the party and say goodbye. Kleiser directed Newton-John in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' almost 20 years earlier.\n\n==Plot==\n''It's My Party'' chronicles a two-day party hosted by Nick Stark ([[Eric Roberts]]) a gay [[architect]] who, having been diagnosed with [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]], will fall into a state of [[persistent vegetative state|mental lapse]] lasting for months until his death. He decides to host a party for his family and friends, at the end of which he will commit [[suicide]] by taking [[Seconal]].\n\n\"You won't leave me, will you?\" Nick asks his estranged lover, Brandon Theis ([[Gregory Harrison]]) a [[B movie]] director, shortly after revealing to him the results of his last blood test for HIV. \"I don't want to die alone.\" In spite of Brandon's protestations, the two soon find the love they had shared for many years in ruins. One year after their breakup, Nick is confronted with a ravaged immune system and a CT Scan and lab values which, along with his worsening forgetfulness, clinches the diagnosis of [[Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) -- a condition he has seen claim his friends and one which he vows will not take him. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, he has only a few days of conscious life remaining. His plan, he announces to family and \"extended family,\" is to voluntarily end his life himself before the disease renders him unrecognizable to those he loves and he, in turn, is unable to recognize them. Uninvited to the farewell party, Brandon's presence is greeted with jeers from those who see him as having abandoned Nick in his time of greatest need.\n\n== Cast ==<!-- for guidelines plz see WP:FILMCAST -->\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Nick Stark\n* [[Margaret Cho]] as Charlene Lee\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Amalia Stark\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Rodney Bingham\n* [[Olivia Newton-John]] as Lina Bingham\n* [[Devon Gummersall]] as Andrew Bingham\n* [[George Segal]] as Paul Stark\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Daphne Stark\n* [[Gregory Harrison]] as Brandon Theis\n* [[Bronson Pinchot]] as Monty Tipton\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Damian Knowles\n* [[Steve Antin]] as Zack Phillips\n* [[Sally Kellerman]] as Sara Hart\n* [[Lou Liberatore]] as Joel Ferris\n* [[Nina Foch]] as Mrs. Theis\n* [[Christopher Atkins]] as Jack Allen\n* [[Dennis Christopher]] as Douglas Reedy\n* [[Ron Glass]] as Dr. David Wahl\n* [[Paul Regina]] as Tony Zamara\n* [[Dimitra Arliss]] as Fanny Kondons\n* [[Cassandra Peterson]] (''uncredited'') as Party guest\n* [[Joey Cramer]] (''uncredited'') as Party guest\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10.<ref>{{cite web |date=22 March 1996 |title=It's My Party |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/its_my_party |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-11-05 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |author1-link=Roger Ebert |title=It's My Party movie review & film summary (1996) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/its-my-party-1996 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=March 22, 1996}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''It's My Party'' opened in 28 theaters on March 22, 1996 with $148,532.
