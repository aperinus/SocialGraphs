In 1999, Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate the skeleton of a monster similar to Godzilla in a cavern unearthed by a collapsed uranium mine in the [[Philippines]]. They also find two giant spores, one dormant and one hatched, along with a trail leading to the sea. In Japan, the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant experiences unusual seismic activity as supervisor Joe Brody sends his wife Sandra to lead a team of technicians into the reactor. A tremor breaches the reactor, forcing Joe to close the reactor door before Sandra and her team can escape while the plant collapses.\n\nFifteen years later, Joe and Sandra's son Ford, a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] officer, returns from a tour of duty to his wife Elle and son Sam in [[San Francisco]], but must immediately depart for Japan after Joe is detained for trespassing in Janjira's quarantine zone. Joe is determined to find out the cause of the meltdown and persuades Ford to accompany him to retrieve vital data from their old home. They learn that the zone is uncontaminated and retrieve the data, but are discovered and taken to a facility in the plant's ruins. The facility harbors a massive [[chrysalis]] that had been feeding off the plant's reactors for 15 years and emitting intense electromagnetic pulses over time. A giant winged insect-like creature emerges from the chrysalis and escapes, destroying the facility. Joe is severely injured and later dies. The incident is reported publicly as an earthquake.\n\nSerizawa and Graham join a U.S. Navy task force led by Admiral William Stenz to search for the creature, dubbed a \"[[MUTO]]\" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Serizawa and Graham reveal to Ford that a 1954 deep-sea expedition awakened Godzilla. Nuclear tests in the 1950s were attempts to kill him; when this did not work, Project Monarch was established to study Godzilla and similar monsters secretly. They also explain that the MUTO caused the Janjira meltdown. Ford reveals Joe had monitored [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] signals indicating the MUTO was communicating with something, presumably Godzilla.\n\nThe MUTO attacks a [[Russian Navy|Russian]] submarine and drops it in [[O'ahu]] to eat its nuclear material. Godzilla arrives, causing a [[tsunami]] in [[Honolulu]], and briefly engages the MUTO in battle until it flees. Serizawa deduces Godzilla was only listening as the MUTO was communicating with something else, prompting the military to investigate the other spore stored in the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in [[Nevada]]. However, a second, bigger, wingless MUTO has already emerged and attacks [[Las Vegas]]. The scientists deduce that it is female and was what the male was communicating with, their signals being a mating call.\n\nOver the scientists' objections, Stenz approves a plan of using nuclear warheads to lure all three monsters out into the open ocean and destroy them. Returning to the U.S., Ford joins the team delivering the warheads by train, but the female MUTO intercepts them and devours most of the warheads. The remaining warhead is airlifted with Ford to San Francisco, where the monsters are converging, and activated after Godzilla appears at the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], only for the male MUTO to snatch it and take it to the female, who forms a nest around it in the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] area.\n\nWhile Godzilla and the MUTOs battle, Ford and a strike team enter the city via [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO jump]] to find and disarm the warhead before it detonates. Unable to access the timer, the team gets the warhead onto a boat for disposal at sea while Ford destroys the nest. Godzilla defeats the MUTOs and collapses on the shore from exhaustion. Ford gets the boat out to the open sea, is rescued before the warhead explodes, and reunites with his family at an emergency shelter the following morning. Godzilla reawakens and returns to the sea, while the media dubs him the \"King of the Monsters\" and speculate whether he might be a savior.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = Taylor-Johnson, Olsen, and Cranston promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Aaron Taylor-Johnson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1    = 190\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Elizabeth Olsen by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width2    = 190\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Bryan Cranston by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| width3    = 190\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as U.S. Navy [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]] Ford Brody:<ref name=\"Production Notes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/05/02/godzilla-production-notes-and-images/|title=Godzilla Production Notes and Images|work=Scifi Japan|date=May 2, 2014|access-date=July 18, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013612/http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2014/05/02/godzilla-production-notes-and-images/}}</ref><br>The son of Joe and Sandra Brody.

We would say 'Imagine it was a news story, or a sports event, cameramen would put cameras where they could in a hurry, and get any shot they could.' This is what we wanted [Godzilla] to feel like, as if people were filming glimpses at any chance they could.\" He also found himself \"Doing things [I] think are cliche; panning up just as a roar happens, or getting the perfect shot, things I shake my head at when watching other people's films.

However, Godzilla illustrator Yuji Kaida called the film \"a real [[kaiju|kaij\u016b eiga]] (monster movie) that honored the original in that Godzilla was presented as a force beyond human understanding that maintained the Earth\u2019s natural balance\".<ref name=\"jtimes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/08/09/national/media-national/critics-get-frank-comes-godzilla/|title=Critics get frank when it comes to Godzilla|last=Brasor|first=Philip|work=Japan Times|date=August 9, 2014|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nWilliam Tsutsui, author of ''Godzilla on My Mind,'' discussed the new film in an article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine. \"This latest reboot brings to the screen a Godzilla that remains true to the spirit of the Japanese series while creating a very American, very twenty-first-century monster.\" He noted that the film \"depicts gluttony for food and sex in ways that were never a feature of Japanese productions. There are far more overt displays of affection in the first 15 minutes of the 2014 ''Godzilla'' than in the entire Japanese franchise, which totaled one very chaste kiss over 50 years.\" He also noted that the film is more violent than the Japanese series, showing more carnage. The Godzilla character, in its heroism, is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s Japanese Godzilla, but not anthropomorphized like those. Also, the identity of the character as Japanese is lost: \"In the 28 films made by Toho, Godzilla is unmistakably identified as one of ''wareware Nihonjin'' (we Japanese).

Rather than offering caution about nuclear energy, the new film almost gives you the idea that nuclear weapons are actually the answer to everything\". Godziszewski did iterate that he did enjoy the film and praised the monster battles for being choreographed closer to the original Toho films than how ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' was choreographed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/interviews/ed_godziszewski_01-2016.html|title=Interview: Ed Godziszewski|last=Galvan|first=Patrick|work=Toho Kingdom|date=January 12, 2016|access-date=September 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDavid Kalat (author of ''A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series'') felt that Edwards figured out a successful \"modern American context\" for the film in supporting American troops, stating, \"Edwards' Godzilla (2014) takes that concept and weaponizes it: we're used to seeing Godzilla movies where the military fails because they're stupid, but seeing them fail but be heroic while failing is new. It's also something the culture needs\u2014and it's the kind of heretical idea that's otherwise hard to dramatize in pop culture, just like the original Godzilla's anti-American stance was so potent in 1954.\" However, Kalat criticized the film for giving Godzilla \"almost no screen-time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tohokingdom.com/interviews/david-kalat_08-2016.html|title=Interview: David Kalat|last=Galvan|first=Patrick|work=Toho Kingdom|date=August 7, 2016|access-date=September 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSteve Ryfle (author of ''Japan's Favorite Mon-Star'') felt that \"America is incapable of making an honest Godzilla.\" Ryfle criticized how the film \"contorts and distorts history in order to avoid confronting the uncomfortable facts of American culpability in the monster\u2019s origin.\" He accused the film of \"whitewashing\" the source material to \"negate the monster\u2019s politics for American consumption\" and concluded by stating, \"Edwards has claimed that his film\u2019s disaster pornography\u2014digitally realistic images resembling Fukushima, the Indian Ocean tsunami, Katrina, 9/11\u2014contextualizes the story for our dangerous modern world.
