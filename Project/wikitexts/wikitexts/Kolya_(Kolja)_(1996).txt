Franti\u0161ek Louka, a middle-aged Czech man dedicated to bachelorhood and the pursuit of women, is a concert [[cello|cellist]] struggling to eke out a living by playing funerals at the [[Prague]] [[crematorium]]s. He has lost his previous job at the [[Czech Philharmonic]], having been half-accidentally blacklisted as \"politically unreliable\" by the authorities. A friend offers him a chance to earn a great deal of money through a [[sham marriage]] to a [[Soviet]] woman to enable her to stay in Czechoslovakia. The woman then uses her new citizenship to emigrate to [[West Germany]], where her boyfriend lives.\n\nDue to a concurrence of circumstances, she has to leave behind her 5-year-old son, Kolya, for the disgruntled Czech musician to look after. At first Louka and Kolya have communication difficulties, as they don't speak each other's languages and the many [[false friend]] words that exist in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] add to the confusion. Gradually, though, a bond forms between Louka and Kolya. The child suffers from suspected [[meningitis]] and has to be placed on a course of carefully monitored [[antibiotic]]s. Louka is threatened with imprisonment for his suspect marriage and the child may be placed in a Soviet children's home. The [[Velvet Revolution]] intervenes though, and Kolya is reunited with his mother. Louka and Kolya say their goodbyes.\n\nLouka returns to the Czech Philharmonic and plays ''[[M\u00e1 Vlast]]'' with the orchestra under the conductor [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]] at the [[Old Town Square]] in 1990, while his pregnant girlfriend Kl\u00e1ra watches from the crowd.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* Andrey Khalimon as Kolya\n* [[Zden\u011bk Sv\u011br\u00e1k]] as  Franti\u0161ek Louka\n* [[Libu\u0161e \u0160afr\u00e1nkov\u00e1]] as Kl\u00e1ra\n* [[Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd]] as Mr. Bro\u017e\n* [[Stella Z\u00e1zvorkov\u00e1]] as Louka's mother\n* [[Lillian Malkina]] as Tamara\n* [[Irina Bezrukova]] as Kolya's mother\n* [[Ladislav Smoljak]] as Houdek \n* [[Karel He\u0159m\u00e1nek]] as Musil\n* [[Petra \u0160palkov\u00e1]] as Pa\u0161a\n* [[Ren\u00e9 P\u0159ibyl]] as Pokorn\u00fd\n* [[Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd]] as Novotn\u00fd\n* [[Sl\u00e1vka Bud\u00ednov\u00e1]] as Bu\u0161t\u00edkov\u00e1\n* [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Sov\u00e1k]] as R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka\n}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on July 2, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hive4media.com/insidevsm/scripts/new_videos.cfm?nextstart=21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020703134323/http://www.hive4media.com/insidevsm/scripts/new_videos.cfm?nextstart=21|title=News|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=July 3, 2002|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film gained positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title= What a Difference a Boy Makes|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=1997-01-24|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06EFDF173AF937A15752C0A961958260|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Kolya|publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|date=1997-01-27|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970127/REVIEWS/701270301/1023|access-date=2012-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= FILM REVIEW \u2013 Charming 'Kolya' Has Magic Touch|publisher= [[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1997-09-12|url=  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/09/12/DD54597.DTL#ixzz1wpxracEP|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Edward|last=Guthmann}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= A Heart-Tugger With a Czech Twist|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1997-01-24|url=  http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-24/entertainment/ca-21479_1_zdenek-sverak|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref> It received Honorable Mention at [[53rd Venice International Film Festival]].\n\n===Box office===\nIn the Czech Republic, the movie's country of origin, over 1.34 million visitors made the movie one of the most successful movies ever.
