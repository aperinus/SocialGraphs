Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate warning about a beast that feeds off the moon but they don't believe her. That same night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on [[Mulholland Drive]] by his older sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke.\n\nDriving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half. When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a [[List of fatal bear attacks in North America|bear]] or [[List of fatal cougar attacks in North America|cougar]].\n\nThe next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood, but she dismisses it. At a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a wolf-like creature. Jimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns, she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.\n\nJimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing]] his own [[homosexuality]].\n\nEllie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela. Zela warns about the effect the coming full moon will have and tells her that the only way to cure herself is to end the line of the werewolf who cursed her. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. The siblings dog Zipper, who has become increasingly afraid of his owners, bites Jimmy, becoming infected with the curse, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy. Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.\n\nEllie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf and he confirms it. However, he reveals that he didn't attack her and Jimmy as he was born a werewolf and can control his transformations. When another werewolf attacks the two, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake and committed all of the previous murders. She now wants to kill all potential rivals so Jake will be hers.\n\nWhen Jake offers to let Joanie kill him to protect Ellie, she refuses as she knows killing him would break her curse. After knocking him out she turns into her werewolf form and starts attacking Ellie and Jimmy. The siblings fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire eventually killing her when policeman shoots her in the head. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.\n\nJimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jimmy and Ellie begin transforming. Jake arrives, revealing that as he caused Joanie's curse, the only way to cure Ellie is to kill him. He wants to be with her, but also kill Jimmy so only he is the alpha male. She and Jake fight, but he dominates the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body [[Spontaneous combustion|bursts into flames]].\n\nBo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Bo and Jimmy are now friends; Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo. Ellie is stuck with the clean-up of the messy house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Ellie Myers\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jimmy Myers\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Joanie\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Bo\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Brooke\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Zela\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Becky Morton\n* [[M\u00fda]] as Jenny Tate\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Kyle\n* [[Eric Ladin]] as Louie\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as nosebleed co-worker\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as police officer\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Werewolf\n* [[Scott Baio]] as himself\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as himself\n* [[Lance Bass]] as himself\n* [[Bowling for Soup]] as themselves\n* Solar as Zipper, Ellie and Jimmy's dog\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe first draft of the script was written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] in August 2000 and followed the exploits of a New York City serial killer who discovers that his lethal tendencies are due to his lycanthrope nature.<ref name=\"Gregg Preview\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808451659&intl=us |title=Gregg's Preview: 'Cursed' 2004 |work=[[Yahoo Movies]] |first=Greg Dean |last=Schmitz |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204170604/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808451659&intl=us |access-date=February 3, 2022|archive-date=December 4, 2003 }}</ref>\nBoth screenwriters [[Sean Hood]] and [[Tony Gayton]] did rewrites of Williamson\u2019s original script during the development process.<ref name=\"Gregg Preview\"/>\nDimension Films co-founder [[Bob Weinstein]] announced in October 2002 that ''Cursed'' would \"reinvent the werewolf genre,\" and [[Wes Craven]] would direct, with the movie being officially released on August 8, 2003.<ref name=\"Gregg Preview\"/> Craven was in the final stages of pre-production with the movie ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' when Weinstein abruptly pulled the movie from the schedule ten days before shooting and cut through all the slow lanes, getting ''Cursed'' off and running.<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/> Craven was reportedly not pleased so Weinstein doubled his pay in order for him to do the werewolf film.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The director deemed the script too tonally similar to his film ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', but felt pressured by the studio, leading him to ultimately sign on.<ref name=\"Lussier\">{{cite AV media|host=Pizowell|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gum1tB2D4Eo|title=''Patrick Lussier on'' Cursed ''(2005) - The Disastrous Production, The Many Cuts & Will We Ever See Them''|date=July 14, 2021|via=Youtube|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\"Wes and Kevin are a dynamic team, and we are confident that their collaboration will prove to be a winner,\" Weinstein stated.<ref name=\"Variety Ricci\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/cursed-casts-ricci-1117882244/ |title='Cursed' casts Ricci |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=David |last=Rooney |date=March 13, 2003 |access-date=February 3, 2022}}</ref>\nIn December 2002, a press release for the project described ''Cursed'' as a \"modern, hip twist on the classic werewolf tale\" and Dimension Films also announced that [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner [[Prosthetic makeup|makeup effects]] designer [[Rick Baker]] would be in charge of the overall design of the werewolves.

According to Lussier, the unfinished original version of the film ran about 90 minutes long, and the only thing it was missing, besides the ending, was the score and all the visual effects.<ref name=\"Lussier\"/> \nThe movie was put back into a development phase during which all parties discussed on the final outcome. Several options were considered, including shooting the final confrontation as it was originally written or transform the script into something different, saving as much filmed footage as possible. One alternative was to turn the characters of Jesse Eisenberg and John C. McGinley into werewolf hunters.<ref name=\"Lussier\"/>\nUltimately, the originally screenplay went under a major rewrite that turned Ellie and Jimmy into estranged siblings and morphed Vince into Ellie\u2019s mysterious boyfriend Jake. From those 90 minutes, the new version only included about 12 minutes of the original footage.<ref name=\"Lussier\"/>\n\nAfter a tentative September restart, the movie officially went back into production on November 17, 2003. \"Quite an extraordinary amount of new material is going to be shot, and a lot of material is going to be thrown away,\" Craven said at the time.<ref name=\"syfy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-film.html?2003-09/10/13.00.film |title=Cursed Reshoots; Baker Quits |work=[[Syfy]] |first= |last= |date=September 3, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211210705/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-film.html?2003-09/10/13.00.film |access-date=February 3, 2022|archive-date=December 11, 2003 }}</ref> [[Rick Baker]], who had created the original werewolf design, left the project because of scheduling conflicts<ref name=\"Baker\"/> and [[KNB EFX Group]] came on board to oversee all the new makeup effects.<ref name=\"syfy\"/>\nThe exteriors for Jake\u2019s new club Tinsel were shot in Vine Street, next to [[Capitol Records Building|The Capitol Records Tower]], [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and Jimmy and Ellie\u2019s house was built on the [[Universal Studios Lot|Universal Studios backlot]].<ref name=\"Location\"/>\nIn the film, Ellie works among the crew of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', with Kilborn making a [[cameo appearance]] and [[Scott Baio]], as himself, being booked to appear on the show. Kilborn left the show a few months after shooting wrapped, in August 2004, before the film\u2019s release, and was replaced by [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\nOn January 17, 2004, the extensive reshoot wrapped. The new ending of the film was much more emotional and tragic, and featured Jackson's character begging his girlfriend Ellie to kill him to end the curse. An article about the film in ''Fangoria'' #241 included pictures of a head prop for Jake's original death scene. From all versions of the film which were test screened to audiences (excluding the original version, which was never test screened), this one scored the highest, but Dimension Films was dissatisfied with it and demanded a new one. Actor Jesse Eisenberg, who, along with Christina Ricci, was one of the few actors to work in all the different versions, stated: \u201cThe crazy part is that after we filmed the whole second version of the film, we had to go back for a third re-shoot which lasted about 20 days.

The second version was definitely cutting corners in a lot of different ways. And the plot? I thought it was so stupid. I thought the plot was so clich\u00e9. They made us brother and sister? The things that they kept [from the original film] were little snippets. Like a car rolling down a hill. They kept that shot.\"<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nEditor Patrick Lussier was supposed to work on the film for only six weeks in summer 2003, but ended up working on it for 19 months. He also worked as a second unit director during the extensive reshoots.\nAll Rick Baker\u2019s designs were cut and most of KNB practical effects were replaced by CGI, including Judy Greer\u2019s transformation. Nevertheless, Rick Baker\u2019s name was displayed in the opening credits as the sole special makeup effects designer and creator.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Dimension Films cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Craven commented, \"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/> Jenny's death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, although not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a ''Fangoria'' article published before the film's release covering the infamously troubled production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smg.photobucket.com/user/marcobeltrami/media/scream/cursedmya.jpg.html|title=Photo by marcobeltrami|access-date=September 2, 2017|via=[[Photobucket]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163145/http://smg.photobucket.com/user/marcobeltrami/media/scream/cursedmya.jpg.html|archive-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref> Craven and Lussier would move on to ''[[Red Eye (2005 American film)|Red Eye]]'', and during that film's post-production they would learn that ''Cursed'' would be edited down to accommodate a PG-13 rating. A nightmare sequence featuring Jake's throat getting ripped out by Ellie was redone without Craven, instead with [[Joel Soisson]] serving as director.<ref name=\"Samuelson 2022\"/> In 2008, Craven was quoted saying, \"...the ''Cursed'' experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a-half years of my life for a film that wasn't anything close to what it should have been. [\u2026] I did learn from the ''Cursed'' experience not to do something for money. They said, 'We know you want to do another film, we'll pay you double.' And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it's not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn't rung is that that story is pretty well known.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn July 2021, Brian Collins from Screamfest blog did a review and comparison between the final film and both the Craven's original unfinished cut and first reshot version, which were surfaced from VHS workprints, and both versions were praised as superior to the final film. This is not the first time when news about alternate versions of ''Cursed'' existing were reported. Some years ago when he was asked by fans about the film, Patrick Lussier mentioned how he still has copies of three unreleased versions of the film (Craven's unfinished cut, first reshot version, and fully uncut reshot version with all the deleted gore and practical effects by KNB from before most of their work was cut as well), and in October 2018, former Dimension COO Cary Blanat confirmed that all original and deleted footage from ''Cursed'' still exists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screamfestla.com/blog/thoughts-original-version-cursed|title=Thoughts On The Original (!)
