It stars [[Julia Roberts]], [[Jude Law]], [[Natalie Portman]], and [[Clive Owen]]. The film, like the play on which it is based, has been seen by some as a modern and tragic version of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', with references to the opera in both the plot and the soundtrack.<ref name=Felsenfeld>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbillarts.com/features/article/5558.html|title=Cos\u00ec fan tutte and the Shock of the Now|date=November 8, 2006|last=Felsenfeld|first=Daniel|access-date=June 8, 2009}}</ref> Owen starred in the play as Dan, the role played by Law in the film.\n\nThe film received positive reviews and grossed $115 million at the box office. It was recognized with a number of [[#Awards and nominations|awards and nominations]], including [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and [[Golden Globes|Golden Globe]] wins for both Portman and Owen for their performances in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a busy morning in London, writer Dan Woolf meets a beautiful American woman after she is hit by a car, not used to the direction of traffic in England. On their walk back from the hospital, they stop by [[Postman's Park]]. Dan asks her name, which she gives as Alice Ayres. They soon become lovers.\n\nA year later, Dan has written a novel based on Alice's life. While being photographed to publicise it, he flirts with the American photographer Anna Cameron. They share a kiss before Alice arrives. While she uses the bathroom, Dan tries to persuade Anna to have an affair with him but their conversation is cut short by Alice's return. Alice then asks Anna if she can have her portrait taken as well. Anna agrees, and Alice asks Dan to leave them alone during the photoshoot. While being photographed, she reveals to Anna that she overheard them, and she is photographed while crying. Alice doesn't tell Dan what she heard and their relationship continues, but Dan spends a year brooding over his interest in Anna.\n\nAnother year later, Dan enters a cybersex chat room and converses with Larry Gray, a British dermatologist. With Anna still on his mind, Dan pretends to be her, and invites Larry to meet at the aquarium, where Anna told Dan she often went. Larry goes to the rendezvous, where he by chance meets Anna and learns that he is the victim of a prank. Anna tells Larry that Dan was most likely to blame for the setup. Soon, Anna and Larry become a couple.\n\nFour months later at Anna's photo exhibition, Larry meets Alice, whom he recognises from the photograph of her in tears, which is being exhibited. Larry knows that Alice and Dan are a couple from talking to Anna. Dan persuades Anna to become involved with him. They cheat on their respective lovers for a year, even though Anna and Larry marry halfway through the year. Eventually Anna and Dan each confess the affair to their respective partners, leaving their relationships for one another.\n\nHeartbroken by her loss, Alice becomes a stripper once again. One day, Larry runs into her accidentally at the strip club. He asks her real name, and she tells him it is Jane Jones. He asks her to have sex with him, but she refuses. Later, Larry and Anna meet for coffee. She asks him to sign their divorce papers, and he bargains with her- she agrees to sleep with him so that he will sign the documents and thereafter leave her alone. Anna and Dan later meet and, after she reveals to him that the divorce papers have been signed, Dan realizes she has had sex with Larry. She claims she did it so he would leave them alone, but Dan is furious and does not trust her.\n\nA distraught Dan later confronts Larry to try to get Anna back. Larry tells him Anna never filed the signed divorce papers and suggests that he return to Alice. Alice takes Dan back and they plan a visit to the United States for a vacation. While in a hotel room at [[Gatwick Airport]] celebrating being back together, they talk about the way they met. After bringing up Larry, Dan asks her whether she had sex with him. She initially denies it but a short while later, she says she doesn't love him anymore and that she did sleep with Larry. Dan forgives her but Alice insists that it's over and tells him to leave. The argument culminates in Dan slapping Alice.\n\n[[Image:AliceAyres.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Alice Ayres]] tile in the [[Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice]], [[Postman's Park]], London]]\nAt the conclusion of the film, Larry and Anna are together, and Alice returns to New York City alone. As she passes through the immigration checkpoint on her way back into the States, a shot of her passport shows her real name to be Jane Jones, revealing she had lied about her name during her entire four-year relationship with Dan but had told the truth to Larry, even though he didn't believe her.  Back in London, Dan returns to Postman's Park and notices the name [[Alice Ayres]] on the tiles of the [[Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice]]. The Ayres dedication is to a young woman, \"who by intrepid conduct\" and \"at the cost of her own young life,\" rescued three children from a fire.\n\nThe final scene, which resembles the first, shows Jane walking on a New York street alone being stared at by several of the men around her. She crosses a crosswalk that appears to have a \"Don't Walk\" signal up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Anna Cameron\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Alice Ayres / Jane Jones\n* [[Jude Law]] as Daniel \"Dan\" Woolf\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Larry Gray\n* Nick Hobbs as Taxi Driver\n* [[Colin Stinton]] as Customs Officer\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\n''Closer'' was filmed at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Film and Television Studios]] and on location in [[London]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Elstree Studios |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b950c9b55 |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=BFI |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Closer Locations |url=https://www.latlong.net/location/closer-locations-752 |access-date=2022-10-21 |website=www.latlong.net |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe main theme of the film follows [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]'', with references to that opera in both the plot and the soundtrack.<ref name=Felsenfeld/> One of the pivotal scenes develops to the background of the overture to Rossini's opera ''La Cenerentola'' (\"Cinderella\").
