They happen upon Brigadoon, a miraculously blessed village that rises out of the mists every hundred years for only a day. (This was done so that the village would never be changed or destroyed by the outside world.)  Tommy falls in love with village lass Fiona Campbell ([[Cyd Charisse]]), whose younger sister Jean ([[Virginia Bosler]]), is about to be married to Charlie Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson). When Tommy and Jeff happen upon clues about the village and its people that make no sense, Fiona takes them to see Mr. Lundie ([[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]]), the village schoolmaster, who tells them the story of Brigadoon and the miracle. If any villager ever leaves Brigadoon, the spell will be broken and the village will vanish forever. Furthermore, Lundie tells them, any outsider who wishes to stay must love someone in the village strongly enough to accept the loss of everything he or she knew in the outside world. That evening, Mr. Lundie officiates at the wedding of Jean and Charlie, which Tommy and Fiona attend. Interrupting the wedding, the jealous Harry Beaton ([[Hugh Laing]]) announces he is leaving Brigadoon to make everything disappear, since the girl he loves, Jean, is marrying another man.   Harry's words cause mass chaos among the townspeople and they all rush to stop him. Harry almost crosses the bridge but is stopped short by Tommy. They scuffle and Tommy is knocked unconscious. With men closing in on him, Harry climbs up a tree to hide but is accidentally gunned down by Jeff, who skipped the wedding to go hunting. Harry falls dead to the ground and is soon found by the men. Fiona frantically searches for and finds Tommy.  Confessing their love for each other, they decide to marry, allowing Tommy to stay in Brigadoon for good. But while Fiona goes off to find Mr. Lundie, Tommy tells Jeff about his plan. Jeff, drunk and remorseful of accidentally killing Harry, tells Tommy he can't just leave everything in the real world behind for this girl he's only known a day. Fiona returns with Mr. Lundie, but Tommy confesses that he cannot stay. Fiona says she understands but is heartbroken and they say good-bye before Brigadoon completely disappears. Tommy and Jeff cross the bridge and walk away.\n\nBack in New York City, Tommy can think only of Fiona.  Unable even to talk with his fianc\u00e9e, Tommy ends his relationship with her and calls Jeff, telling him to get the first flight back to Scotland. He and Jeff return to the same spot where they were lost, though Jeff reminds him again the village will not be there.  But suddenly Tommy sees lights start to appear through the mist and runs toward them.  Brigadoon reappears and Tommy gets to the foot of the bridge to see Mr. Lundie half-awake on the other side saying: \"Tommy, lad, you! My, my, you must really love her. You woke me up.\" Tommy seems stunned that Brigadoon has been brought back, but Mr. Lundie reminds him: \"I told ye, if you love someone deeply enough, anything is possible ... even miracles.\"\n\nTommy then runs across the bridge and reunites with Fiona as the village fades back into the mist.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Tommy Albright\n* [[Van Johnson]] as Jeff Douglas\n* [[Cyd Charisse]] as Fiona Campbell\n* [[Elaine Stewart]] as Jane Ashton\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as Mr. Lundie\n* [[Hugh Laing]] as Harry Beaton\n* [[Albert Sharpe]] as Andrew Campbell\n* [[Virginia Bosler]] as Jean Campbell\n* [[Eddie Quillan]] as Sandy\n* Jimmy Thompson as Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple\n* [[Tudor Owen (actor)|Tudor Owen]] as Archie Beaton\n* Owen McGiveney as Angus\n* Dee Turnell as Ann\n* [[Dodie Heath]] as Meg Brockie (as Dody Heath)\n* Michael Dugan as Townsman (uncredited)\n* [[Barrie Chase]] as Dancer (uncredited)\n* [[George Chakiris]] as Dancer (uncredited)\n* [[Madge Blake]] as Mrs. McIntosh (uncredited)\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as New York Club Patron (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[J.

Unfortunately, an unpredictable climate and higher location production costs (the latter not compatible with MGM President [[Dore Schary]]'s thriftiness), forced them to change course.<ref name=\"notes\" /> Kelly and producer [[Arthur Freed]] traveled to Scotland to confirm for themselves if the weather was too unreliable, and they agreed with the studio.<ref name=\"notes\" /> In Kelly's biography it was stated that \"the weather was so bad that we had to agree with the studio. So we came back to the United States and started looking for locations here. We found some highlands above Monterey [in Big Sur] that looked like Scotland. But then the studio had an economy wave, and they clamped the lid on that idea.\"<ref name=\"notes\" /> Much to the disappointment of the cast and crew and the delight of [[Dore Schary]], filming had to take place on the sound stages at MGM instead.\n\nDancer-actor [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]] had originated the part of Harry Beaton in the original 1947 Broadway production of ''Brigadoon'' and scored a great success. When the film began shooting in 1953, Mitchell was already under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and had just completed work on the [[Fred Astaire]] musical film ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' which was directed by Vincente Minnelli and co-starred Cyd Charisse. However, rather than have Mitchell reprise his stage role, the studio instead cast [[New York City Ballet]] dancer Hugh Laing as Harry Beaton. In December 1954, a few months after the release of ''Brigadoon'', Mitchell and Charisse made a cameo appearance dancing with each other to the song \"[[One Alone]]\" in the M-G-M Sigmund Romberg musical biography film ''[[Deep in My Heart (1954 film)|Deep in My Heart]]''.\n\nIn addition, rather than being filmed in the expensive original three-strip [[Technicolor]] process with the 1.33:1 square-frame aspect ratio, the film was shot in single-strip [[Metrocolor]] and utilized [[CinemaScope]], the newly patented [[20th Century Fox]] 2.55:1 [[anamorphic format|anamorphic widescreen]] process.<ref name=\"article\" />\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"Once in the Highlands/Brigadoon/Down on MacConnachy Square\"&nbsp;\u2013 Eddie Quillan, Villagers, and Offscreen M-G-M Chorus\n# \"Waiting for My Dearie\"&nbsp;\u2013 Cyd Charisse (dubbed by [[Carol Richards]]) and Dee Turnell (dubbed by Bonnie Murray)\n# \"I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean\"&nbsp;\u2013 Jimmy Thompson (dubbed by John Gustafson), Gene Kelly, Van Johnson and Chorus\n# \"The Heather on the Hill\"&nbsp;\u2013 Gene Kelly, Danced by Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse\n# \"[[Almost Like Being in Love]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 Sung and Danced by Gene Kelly\n# \"The Wedding Dance\"&nbsp;\u2013 Danced by Jimmy Thompson and Virginia Bosler\n# \"The Chase\"&nbsp;\u2013 Sung by men pursuing Hugh Laing\n# \"The Heather on the Hill\"&nbsp;\u2013 Danced by Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse\n# \"I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean\" (reprise)&nbsp;\u2013 Sung offscreen by Jimmy Thompson, Carol Richards and Chorus\n# \"The Heather on the Hill\" (reprise) &nbsp;\u2013 Sung offscreen by Jimmy Thompson, Carol Richards and Chorus\n# \"Waitin' for My Dearie\" (reprise)&nbsp;\u2013 Sung offscreen by Jimmy Thompson, Carol Richards and Chorus\n# \"Finale: Brigadoon\" &nbsp;\u2013  M-G-M Chorus\n:''<small>Source:[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046807/soundtrack IMDB]</small>''\n\nComplete sound and picture footage of three of the deleted musical numbers has survived, and it is included in the latest DVD release of the film.\n\nThe 1954 original motion picture soundtrack was originally incomplete, but was re-released with deleted songs, alternative takes, and undubbed vocals.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of September 17, 1954, described the film as \"curiously flat and out-of-joint, rambling all over creation and seldom generating warmth or charm.\"  Crowther admired the costumes, sets, and decor but deplored the omission of several musical numbers.  He found fault with the film's two stars and its director: \"the personable Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse have the lead dancing roles. Even so, their several individual numbers are done too slickly, too mechanistically. What should be wistful and lyric smack strongly of trickery and style&nbsp;... Mr. Kelly's [performance] is as thin and metallic as a nail; Miss Charisse's is solemn and posey&nbsp;... Vincente Minnelli's direction lacks his usual vitality and flow.\" He concluded by noting the film was \"pretty weak synthetic Scotch.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E6DB1E31E53BBC4F52DFBF66838F649EDE ''The New York Times'' Review] {{Registration required}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' posted a lukewarm review, calling the dance staging \"not particularly arresting, although a few of the numbers will have a desired effect on the audience, and the vocals fail to give the tunes the tonal impact needed to put them over.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 11, 1954 |title=Brigadoon |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote of the film: \"It has much to recommend it from the viewpoint of the production values, and there are individual musical sequences that are nimble, gay, and cheery, but some of the other production numbers are long drawn out and tedious, and on the whole the picture's fantasy theme misfires.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 14, 1954 |title='Brigadoon' with Gene Kelly, Van Johnson and Cyd Charisse |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=130 }}</ref> [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: \"There are times in this version of 'Brigadoon' when one is seized by the wild hope that the exposition of the town's dilemma will be quickly boiled down to an essence, so that Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse can get on with their dancing.
