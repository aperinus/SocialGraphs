It is based on [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]]' [[social experiment]] [[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave]] and [[Todd Strasser]]'s novel ''[[The Wave (novel)|The Wave]]''. The film was produced by [[Christian Becker]] for [[Rat Pack Filmproduktion]]. The movie was successful in German cinemas, and 2.3 million people watched it in the first ten weeks after its release.\n\n==Plot==\nA history teacher, Rainer Wenger, is forced to teach a class on [[autocracy]], despite being an [[Anarchy|anarchist]] and wanting to teach the class on anarchy. When his students, the third generation after the [[World War II|Second World War]],<ref>Jeff Dawson ''...salutes a hit German film ...'' ''[[Sunday Times]]'' 31 Aug 2008</ref> do not believe that a dictatorship could be established in modern Germany, he starts an experiment to demonstrate how easily the masses can be manipulated. He begins by demanding that all students address him as \"Herr Wenger\", as opposed to Rainer,<ref>Note: This is actually the usual way for German students to address teachers. In itself, it is not specifically authoritarian; in this case, it means that Rainer Wenger had ''before'' been a highly unusually informal teacher who changes that policy now.</ref> and places students with poor grades beside students with good grades \u2014 purportedly so they can learn from one another and become better as a whole. When speaking, they must stand and give short, direct answers. Wenger shows his students the effect of marching together in the same rhythm, motivating them by suggesting that they are superior to the anarchy class, which is below them. Wenger suggests a uniform of a white shirt and jeans, to remove class distinction and further unite the group. A student in the class named Mona argues it will remove individuality, but she is dismissed. Another student in the class named Karo shows up to class without the uniform and is ostracized. The students decide among themselves they need a name, deciding on \"Die Welle\" (The Wave). Karo suggests another name, but she is the only person in the class who votes for it.\n\nThe group is shown to grow closer together, and former bullies Sinan and Bomber are shown to reform, protecting Tim, the class outcast, from a pair of anarchists demanding he sell them drugs. Sinan also creates a distinctive logo for the group, while Bomber creates a salute. Tim becomes very attached to the group, having finally become an accepted member of a social group. He burns all of his brand-name clothes, after a discussion about how large corporations do not take responsibility for their actions. Karo and Mona protest the actions of the group, and Mona, disgusted with how her classmates are embracing [[fascism]], leaves the project group. Her other classmates do not see the connection with fascism and continue attending the class. The members of The Wave begin spray-painting their logo around town at night, having parties where only Wave members are allowed to attend, and ostracizing and tormenting anyone not in their group.\n\nWhen Tim and his group of new friends are confronted by a group of angry punks (including those that Tim faced previously), Tim pulls a [[Walther PP]] pistol, causing them to back down. Tim explains to his shocked friends that the pistol only fires blanks. Tim later shows up at Wenger's house, offering to be his bodyguard. Although he declines his offer, Wenger still invites Tim in for dinner; this puts further strain on his already tense relationship with his wife, Anke, who thinks his experiment has gone too far. Wenger finally asks Tim to leave his house, only to find the next morning that Tim had slept outside on his doorstep. Anke, upset upon learning this, tells Wenger to stop the experiment immediately. Wenger accuses her of being jealous and insults her dependency on pills. Shocked, Anke leaves him, saying the Wave has made him into a terrible person.\n\nKaro continues her opposition to the Wave, earning the anger of many in the group, who ask her boyfriend, Marco, to do something about it. A water polo competition is due to happen later that day, and Wenger asks the Wave to show up in support of the team. Karo and Mona, denied entry to the competition by members of The Wave, sneak in another way in order to distribute anti-Wave fliers. Members of the Wave notice this and scramble to retrieve the papers before anybody reads them. In the chaos, Sinan starts a fight with an opposing team member, the two almost drowning each other. Members of the Wave in the stands begin to violently shove one another. After the match, Marco confronts Karo and accuses her of causing the fight. She replies that the Wave has brainwashed him completely. He slaps Karo, causing her to get a nosebleed. Unsettled by his own behaviour, Marco approaches Wenger and asks him to stop the project. Wenger seemingly agrees and calls a rally for the Wave members for the following day in the school's auditorium.\n\nOnce in the rally, Wenger has the doors locked and begins whipping the students into a fervour. When Marco protests, Wenger calls him a traitor and orders the students to bring him to the stage for punishment. However, Wenger turns out to have been acting and was using this meeting to test the students and to see how extreme the Wave has become. Wenger declares that he is disbanding the Wave, but Dennis argues that they should try to salvage the good parts of the movement. Wenger points out there is no way to remove the negative elements of fascism. Seeing the movement falling apart right in front of his very eyes, Tim suffers a mental breakdown and pulls out a gun, refusing to accept the Wave is over as he does not want to lose all that he's gained. When Bomber says the gun only fires blanks and tries to take it, Tim shoots him, revealing it has live rounds. When Tim asks why he shouldn't shoot Wenger too, Wenger says that without him, there would be no one to lead the Wave and it would just die anyway. Utterly consumed by despair, Tim abruptly shoots himself in the head, preferring to commit suicide than go on living without the movement.\n\nHorrified, Wenger cradles his corpse and looks on helplessly at how his own vanity and foolishness have resulted in his whole class being scarred for the rest of their lives. The film ends with Wenger being arrested by the police and driven away, Bomber being taken away to the hospital, and Marco and Karo being re-united; the final shot shows Wenger in the back of a police car, staring blankly into the camera, a look of distress on his face.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]] as Rainer Wenger, the main character and teacher who started the experiment with his class.\n* [[Frederick Lau]] as Tim, an [[emotional insecurity|insecure]] and mentally unstable boy having problems with his family.

The [[Stanford prison experiment]] of 1971 was adapted for the 2001 production ''[[Das Experiment]]'' by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and the 2015 production directed by [[Kyle Patrick Alvarez]], ''[[The Stanford Prison Experiment (film)|The Stanford Prison Experiment]]''. Gansel's Wave is based on teacher Ron Jones's [[The Third Wave (experiment)|\"Third Wave\" experiment]], which took place at a Californian school in 1967. Because his students did not understand how something like [[Nazism|national socialism]] could even happen, he founded a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], strictly-organized \"movement\" with harsh punishments that was led by him autocratically. The intricate sense of community led to a wave of enthusiasm not only from his own students, but also from students from other classes who joined the program later. Jones later admitted to having enjoyed having his students as followers. To eliminate the upcoming momentum, Jones aborted the project on the fifth day and showed the students the parallels towards the Nazi youth movements.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\">Christa Hanetseder: ''Lehrer gegen Vorurteile.

In: ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 3</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Jones published a narrative based on those experiences titled \"[[The Third Wave (experiment)|The Third Wave]]\", which was made into a television movie of the same title in 1981. In the same year, author [[Todd Strasser]], writing under the pen-name \"Morton Rhue\", published his book \"The Wave\" (a novelization of the television movie), which was published in Germany in 1984 and has since enjoyed great success as a school literature text. It has sold a total of over 2.5 million copies.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\" /><ref name=\"StZ\">Ina Hochreuther: ''Die Schule und die Diktatur'' In: ''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 13.

M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 15</ref> The story has also influenced many plays and role plays worldwide.<ref name=\"Hanetseder\"/><ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nThe [[screenplay]] is based on an article written by Ron Jones in which he talks about the experiment and how he remembers it. The rights to the story which belonged to [[Sony]] were given over to Dennis Gansel for the production of a German movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit dem ''Hamburger Abendblatt'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 3: ''\u201eAn den psychologischen Mechanismen hat sich nichts ge\u00e4ndert\u201c''</ref> As a consequence, Todd Strasser, whose novel popularized the material in Germany, and the publisher Ravensburg, did not receive direct revenues from the film project.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\">Daniel Kothenschulte: ''Der freie Wille'' In: ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 33</ref> Gansel was working on the book for one year until he asked [[:de:Peter Thorwarth|Peter Thorwarth]] to join him as a co-author. The screenplay moves the experiment, which was carried out in [[California]] in the 1960s, to present day Germany. The specific location is never mentioned explicitly as it stands for [[Germany]] as a whole. Gansel explained that he did not intend to reenact Jones\u2019 experiment, but rather show how it would be carried out in present-day Germany. He said the movie is not an adaption and that he changed characters, dialogues as well as the beginning and ending of the movie.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> This also includes subsidiary aspects such as the [[football team]] which was turned into a water polo team in the German version whose coach, as opposed to the original, is the teacher himself. The major difference, however, concerns the physical violence and the bloody end which became part of the movie. Nonetheless, Gansel claimed in an interview that it was extremely important to him to ensure that his movie would not differ as much from the experiment as Strasser's book. Thereby he described Jones, who supported the film project as a counselor, as a \"living certificate\" of authenticity and that the ending was inspired by the [[Emsdetten school shooting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoutsiderarg.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/dennis-gansel-riding-on-the-crest-of-the-wave/|title=Dennis Gansel riding on the crest of the wave|date=4 February 2013}}</ref> He claimed that Jones does not like the way the characters in Strasser's novel are depicted.<ref name=\"DG_Cinema\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Cinema'', Nr.&nbsp;4/2008, S. 36</ref> The former teacher commented that Gansel's movie gave an \"incredibly convincing\" account of the actual experiment.<ref name=\"Jung\"/>\n\nAccording to Gansel, representatives of the [[Bavaria]]n film-funding agency which were initially inquired to fund the film project declined because they compared it to Strasser's novel. Furthermore, they criticized that the teacher lacked a clear anti-authoritarian position in the submitted script. The entire project was jeopardized and the first film-funding agency to grant financial aid was the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. Afterwards, the [[:de:Filmf\u00f6rderungsanstalt|German Federal Film Board]] (FFA) and the [[:de:Deutscher Filmf\u00f6rderfonds|German Federal Film Fund]] (DFFF) as well as other co-producers decided to subsidize the project. [[Constantin Film]] also became one of the sponsors and further managed the film's distribution. The overall budget of the movie amounts to 4.5 million euros and the movie was shot within 38 days.\n\n==Themes and Concepts==\n\n===Gansel\u2019s concept===\nAccording to [[Dennis Gansel]], German students have grown tired of the topic concerning the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Gansel himself had felt an oversaturation during his schooldays and had developed an emotional connection to this chapter of German history only after watching the film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> One difference between the experiment conducted at the time in the [[United States]] and today's [[Germany]] he saw in the fact that the American students had asked themselves quite horrified how there could even exist something like the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. His film, however, was made on the premise that people felt immune to the possibility of a repetition of history as a result of the intensive study of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and its mechanisms. \u201cTherein lies the great danger. It is an interesting fact that we always believe that what happens to others would never happen to us. We blame others, for example the less educated or the [[East Germany|East Germans]] etc. However, in the Third Reich the house caretaker was just as fascinated by the movement as was the intellectual.\u201d<ref name=\"DG_Standard\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit ''Der Standard'', 11. Februar 2008, S. 28: ''Faschismus ist f\u00fcr alle anziehend''</ref>\n\nThe small town the movie is set in is prosperous and does not show any salient social or economic problems and the teacher practices a liberal lifestyle. [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] is convinced that the plot gains a broader psychological validity by the choice of such a location.  \u201cEveryone thinks they would have been [[Anne Frank]]s and [[Sophie Scholl]]s in [[Nazi Germany]]. In my opinion this is complete nonsense. I would say that biographies of resistance rather originate in coincidences,\u201d claims Gansel. He then explains that, for example, Karo's political awareness and opposition arise out of vanity: she does not like the white shirt.<ref name=\"DG_StN\">Dennis Gansel im Gespr\u00e4ch mit den ''Stuttgarter Nachrichten'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 12: ''\u201eWiderstandsbiografien entstehen aus Zuf\u00e4llen\u201c''</ref> In the past Gansel had been sure that he would have been part of the resistance but while working on The Wave he realized how \u201cnon-politically\u201d the conversion of people took place.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/> He remarks that every human being has the need for belonging to a group.\n\nHe says he does not believe that films are capable of having a greater political impact on the viewers and that a film can only influence people who were already sensitized to the topic presented. In his opinion films can at best stimulate discussions, but to be able to do that they have to be really entertaining. \u201cIn Germany there has always existed the great misunderstanding that politics in the world of cinema were synonymous with boredom,\u201d says Gansel. He claims that in between high-brow cinema, as films by [[Christian Petzold (director)|Christian Petzold]], and the entertaining comedies by [[Til Schweiger]] there was a vast gap in Germany, which urgently had to be filled.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He made the film in a way that should have a \u201cseductive effect\u201d on the viewers to make them interested in The Wave and by doing so show the powerful attraction such a movement can have.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/><ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> He chose J\u00fcrgen Vogel as the leading actor because he wanted someone he himself would have liked to have as a teacher, for Vogel brought with him real life experience and a certain kind of authority. In Gansel's own schooldays it had been these kind of teachers whom he had trusted the most. Gansel, whose grandfather had been a Wehrmacht officer, also announced that this film would be the first and last one concerning the topic of the Third Reich in his career as a director.<ref name=\"DG_HA\"/>\n\n===Formal realisation===\nTeacher Wenger's casual manner at the beginning of the film contributes to the expectation of a [[Comedy film|comedy]].<ref name=\"Steller\">Ulrich Steller: Kapitel ''Filmische Mittel'' in: ''Die Welle.

M\u00e4rz 2008</ref> or U.S. high school films that assign a particular adolescent type to every character.<ref name=\"FR_13-3-08\"/> [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] focuses less on mental [[motivation]] processes of the individual characters but rather on the resulting sense of community.<ref name=\"Focus\">Harald Pauli: ''Lass den Nazi raus!'' In: ''Focus'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 68</ref> His script co-author Thorwarth emphasized that it is necessary to define the characters very clearly in order to retain the common thread despite the variety. The film is structured by five days of the project week. At this, the beginning of every new day of the week is marked by an insert.<ref name=\"Steller\"/>\n\nThe narrative style doesn't keep the audience at distance, so that it can reflect on the things that happened, but rather lets them experience the occurrences; so the plot is narrated linearly. Similar experiences of various characters, for instance, scenes in which students tell their parents about their day at school, are realized as cross-cutting and thus demonstrate the range of different perceptions of the day. The film is narrated from the perspective of a third person, although particular scenes provide individual characters' subjective points of view. An example for this is the scene in which Karo is in the schoolhouse at night, or the scene at the end when Wenger is arrested by the police and driven away.  While on the one hand Wenger is filmed in low angle shot and sings rock music in the opening sequence, on the other hand he seems depressed in this last scene. \"Slow motion shots reflect [his] tormenting self-reproaches.\" The change to the subjective view of the thoughtful character corresponds to the dramatic composition throughout the film. This change is meant to initiate reflections on the part of the audience.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Gansel justifies the drastic end with the necessity of shocking the audience after the length of the film, of providing a counter-statement and of taking up a stance.<ref name=\"DG_StN\"/> A critic assumed that in this country you can't say Adolf without having consequences. So triggering off fascism involves a couple of dead persons.<ref name=\"SZ_12-3-08\"/>\n\nThroughout the film high and low angle shots are used in order to express the balance of power, those at the \u201ctop\u201d and those at the \u201cbottom\u201d. At some parts, the film utilizes stylistic devices of the Nazi weekly reviews, which recorded [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s speeches. An example for this is the closing speech of Wenger. In this scene the camera is placed close behind him, at the level of his nape, and so offers a view of the geometrically arranged crowd of students.<ref name=\"Steller\"/> Other scenes are based on pop culture. Especially the film clip in which the Wave-supporters spray their logo on buildings, is staged in the style of a [[music video]].<ref name=\"Steller\"/><ref name=\"SpO\">Christoph Cadenbach: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/kino/0,1518,538623,00.html Wie Sch\u00fcler sich freudestrahlend in Faschisten verwandeln]'' In: ''Spiegel Online'', 10. M\u00e4rz 2008</ref> This logo is designed as \"a jagged [[tsunami]] wave in a similar way to [[Manga]] comics.\"<ref name=\"SpO\"/> There is a high frequency and abrupt manner of film editing. There is fast, even rapid camera work and the rock music, that accompanies many of the scenes, is often characterized as impulsive.<ref name=\"StZ\"/><ref name=\"epd_3-08\">Ulrich Sonnenschein: ''Die Welle'' In: ''epd Film'', M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 46</ref><ref name=\"Cinema_4-08\">Heiko Rosner: ''Das Ende der Unschuld'' In: ''Cinema'', Nr.&nbsp;4/2008, S. 34\u201336</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nGerman criticism of ''Die Welle'' was extremely divided. Solely the opinions on the actors were always the same. \u201cFrom the first scene on, the sympathetic guy tears the audience on his side\u201d,<ref name=\"SpO\"/> it was reported about [[J\u00fcrgen Vogel]], he was transforming the moral ambiguity of his figure into a \u201cmercurial energy\u201d.<ref name=\"FAZ_13-3-08\">Andreas Kilb: ''Auf Wiedersehen, Kinder'' In: ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008, S. 36</ref> He played his role realistically,<ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/> was \u201ccredible\u201d<ref name=\"StZ\"/> or the ideal cast.<ref name=\"Zeit_13-3-08\"/> For the young actors the most frequently used word was \u201cconvincing\u201d,<ref name=\"StZ\"/><ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/><ref name=\"StN\">Eva Maria Schlosser: ''Das Experiment entgleist'' In: ''Stuttgarter Nachrichten'', 13.

They criticized that the psychological developments are missed out, Wenger and the other figures are partially constructed by cliches,<ref name=\"epd_3-08\"/> or defined by \u201csomething model-like\u201d,<ref name=\"StZ\"/> they also argued that the figures are \u201cslightly oversubscribed stereotypes\u201d<ref name=\"BZ\">Julia Teichmann: ''Macht, Gemeinschaft, Disziplin'' In: ''Berliner Zeitung'', 12.

The movie, according to the critics, therefore often seems \u201cvery pedagogically prescribing: you know, what is meant, but you don\u2019t really believe it.\u201d<ref name=\"Tgs_13-3-08\">Sebastian Handke: ''Die Wei\u00dfw\u00e4scher'' In: ''Der Tagesspiegel'', 13.

Because [[Dennis Gansel|Gansel]] attributes a position as a left-winger and former squatter to him, he involuntarily provides further evidence for the [[G\u00f6tz Aly]]'s thesis, that the [[German student movement|68er Bewegung]] have further developed the authoritarian body of thought of the Nazis of 1933, they argued critically.<ref name=\"Focus\"/> But the character\u2018s composition was also defended: \u201cThe categorization is rather necessary here, because it shows the vulnerability of entirely different people for one and the same idea.\u201c<ref>Gebhard H\u00f6lzl: ''Die Welle''. In: ''Fr\u00e4nkische Nachrichten'', 13. M\u00e4rz 2008.</ref>\n\nThere was also disagreement about the staging. The movie was exciting, disturbing and fascinating,<ref name=\"Cinema_4-08\"/> and deals with a difficult plot as exciting entertainment, some critics pointed out.<ref name=\"fd_6-08\">Mike Beilfu\u00df: ''Die Welle'' In: ''film-dienst'' Nr.&nbsp;6/2008, S. 53</ref> For a mainstream movie \"The Wave\u201c was often \"pleasantly rough and snotty\u201c, they reported.<ref name=\"SpO\"/> Other critics accused the movie of being conventionally staged, similar to a ''[[Tatort]]''-police procedural TV series,<ref name=\"Tgs_13-3-08\"/> or let off steam about the \"graffiti-scenes and a nearly never-ending escalating party scene.\"<ref name=\"StN\"/>\n\nJones was complimentary of the film, praising its accuracy to the real-life events (despite the changed ending) that he felt the television film and Strasser's book missed. He noted that although the ending deviates from what happened, its depiction of a \"what-if\" scenario for the Wave getting out of the teacher's control was closer to what he felt would happen to a true fascist movement even if its leader renounced it.<ref>{{cite web |title=DIE WELLE - Interview: Ron Jones (Original Lehrer) eng / ger sub |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elK5FOfWJ2k |website=YouTube |access-date=12 February 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack of the film was released on 25 May 2008 through [[EMI|EMI Germany]], and contains tracks by [[The Subways]], [[Kilians]], [[Johnossi]], [[Digitalism (band)|Digitalism]] and [[The Hives]], as well as a cover version of the classic [[Ramones]]' track \"[[Rock 'n' Roll High School (song)|Rock 'n' Roll High School]]\" made for the film by the German punk band [[:de:EL*KE|EL*KE]]. [[:de:Jan Plewka|Jan Plewka]] wrote and recorded a song for the film, ''Was Dich So Ver\u00e4ndert Hat'', in both a German and English version. The German version ended up in the film but the English version is available on an international version of the soundtrack. The title-song \"Garden Of Growing Hearts\" was performed by Berlin band Empty Trash. The original film score was composed by [[Heiko Maile]], a member of the band [[Camouflage (band)|Camouflage]].\n\n#\"Intro\" - J\u00fcrgen Vogel & Tim Oliver Schultz\n#\"Rock'n'Roll Highschool\" - EL*KE\n#\"[[Rock & Roll Queen]]\" (Album Version) - [[The Subways]]\n#\"Execution Song\" - [[Johnossi]]\n#\"Fight The Start\" - [[Kilians]]\n#\"Garden Of Growing Hearts\" (Radio Edit) - Empty Trash\n#\"Spending My Time\" - Orange But Green\n#\"Short Life Of Margott\" - Kilians\n#\"Everything Is Under Control\" - Coldcut\n#\"Bored\" - Ronda Ray featuring&nbsp;Markie J\n#\"Homzone\" - [[Digitalism (band)|Digitalism]]\n#\"Move It!\" - Ronda Ray Featuring [[Trevor Jackson (musician)|Trevor Jackson]]\n#\"Nightlite\" (feat.

The names were changed to sound German, but the characters are similar. For example, Rainer Wenger, Karo, Marco, Mona, and Tim correspond to Ben Ross, Laurie Saunders, David Collins, Andrea, and Robert Billings. The outsider theme was expanded by introducing three new characters: Sinan who is [[Turkish people|Turkish]], Kevin the aggressive bully, and Dennis from [[East Germany]] who is mocked as \"[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossi]]\". The 1981 film's ending, where there is no violence and the teacher is not arrested, is much tamer than the ending of ''Die Welle'' and is more accurate to the real-world events that inspired both films.\n\n==Box-office success and awards==\n\nWhen the movie was released the publisher Die Brosch\u00fcre provided schools with material to help teachers \"to prepare the visit to the movie theater\u201c as well as \"reviewing it afterwards\u201c. Furthermore, an official novel corresponding to the movie, written by Kerstin Winter, was published. The Wave was released with 279<ref>''Spiegel Online'', 17.

One day later it was first screened in Austrian movie theaters. Overall the movie attracted 2.5 million German viewers. [46]\n\nThe Wave received an award for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role ([[Frederick Lau]]) and the [[Deutscher Filmpreis|Bronze Lola]] in the category Best Feature Film at the German Film Awards in 2008 ([[Deutscher Filmpreis]]). Furthermore, Ueli Christen was nominated in the category Best Editing. In the same minute lead actor J\u00fcrgen Vogel was nominated in the category Best Actor at the European Film Awards 2008. Moreover, The Wave was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema - Dramatic section without receiving an award. The movie was also shortlisted for the seating contest of a German airbender for the Oscar in the category Best Foreign Language Film, but lost out to ''[[The Baader Meinhof Complex]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Wave (TV special)]]\n* [[We Are the Wave]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1063669|The Wave}}\n* {{Amg movie|426715|The Wave}}\n* [http://www.thewavehome.com The Wave Home] Website with story history, FAQ, links, etc. by original Wave students\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/16/schoolsworldwide.film/ guardian.co.uk Article]\n\n{{Dennis Gansel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wave, The}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s German-language films]]\n[[Category:German thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dennis Gansel]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
