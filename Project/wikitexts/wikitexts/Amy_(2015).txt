He has distanced himself from the documentary, stating the film is \"misleading\" and \"contains some basic untruths\", according to his spokesman.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/27/amy-winehouse-documentary-family-cannes-film-festival |title=Amy Winehouse documentary is 'misleading', says family |date=27 April 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> On 7 May 2015, Winehouse's father Mitch appeared on ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' and described the film as \"preposterous\". He further stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The film is representing me in a not very good way. There is no balance, there's nothing about the [[Amy Winehouse Foundation|foundation]].

He then added: \"Half of me wants to say don't go see it.  But then the other part of me is saying maybe go see the videos, put your headphones in and listen to Amy's music while they're watching the videos.  It's the narrative that's the problem.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/amy-winehouses-father-mitch-winehouse-5652185 |title=Amy Winehouse's father Mitch Winehouse tells fans NOT to go see biopic made about her life |first=Natalie |last=Corner |date=7 May 2015 |newspaper=The Daily Mirror}}</ref>\n\n[[Universal Music]] instigated the documentary but they only secured the cooperation of the singer's parents, Mitch and Janis Winehouse, when they signed up Kapadia as the director for the film. Winehouse's father, who was a fan of the director's previous documentary film ''[[Senna (film)|Senna]]'' (2010), wanted the same treatment to be given to his late daughter's documentary. However, upon watching the completed film about Winehouse, Mitch was unhappy with how the film portrayed him. Feeling he had been portrayed as the villain, Mitch threatened legal action until limited changes were made to the film. However, he has still publicly condemned the final cut of the film, claiming that Kapadia had an agenda to make him the anti-hero from the start.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nMitch requested that he wants the film to be further edited, but the film crew have declined his wish, adding: \"When we were approached to make the film, we came on board with the full backing of the Winehouse family, and we approached the project with total objectivity.\" They said the film reflects findings from around \"100 interviews with people that knew Amy\". On 3 July 2015 (the day ''Amy'' was initially released), the singer's father, Mitch appeared on ''[[Loose Women]]'' to defend his place against the film and announced that he and Winehouse's former boyfriend, [[Reg Traviss]], are making an alternative film, entitled ''A Letter To Amy'', so it's a \"more accurate\" project, to \"correct all the wrongs and omissions\" that were in Kapadia's film.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/amy-winehouses-dad-ex-boyfriend-5985040 |title=Amy Winehouse's dad and ex boyfriend want to make their own film of her life |newspaper=The Daily Mirror |date=1 July 2015 |access-date=1 July 2015}}</ref> On 24 February 2016, Winehouse's father, Mitch reappeared on ''This Morning'' once again and stated that he would prefer [[Adele]] to win the award that his late daughter was posthumously nominated for at the [[2016 BRIT Awards]].<ref name=\"''Metro\">{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/24/amy-winehouses-dad-doesnt-want-his-late-daughter-to-win-at-the-brits-5714988/ |title=Amy Winehouse's dad wants Adele to win the BRIT over his late daughter |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |first=Tamara |last=Hardingham-Gill |date=24 February 2016 |access-date=24 February 2016}}</ref> This was because the nomination for \"British Female Solo Artist\" was as a result of the film's success, which he seemed to be unhappy about.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
