Produced in [[CinemaScope]], the film depicts a group of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners of war ([[POW]]s) who conduct a daring escape by hijacking the freight train carrying the POWs and fleeing through [[Italian Social Republic|German-occupied Italy]] to [[Switzerland]]. Based on the 1964 novel by [[David Westheimer]], the film changes several aspects of the novel, most notably the ending, which is considerably more upbeat in the book. Financially, it became one of Sinatra's most successful films.\n\n==Plot==\nColonel Joseph Ryan, a [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[P-38]] pilot, is shot down over Italy and taken to a POW camp. Ryan insists that the camp commander, Major Basilio Battaglia salute him as a superior officer, which the sympathetic second-in-command, Captain Vittorio Oriani, translates. Most prisoners are British from the 9th [[Fusilier#United Kingdom|Fusiliers]]. Their previous commanding officer recently died due to being placed in the \"sweat box\" as punishment for hitting Battaglia. Major Eric Fincham is the senior British officer until Ryan, being senior, arrives and assumes command.\n\nItaly is close to surrender, and Ryan declines to support Fincham's escape attempts. When Fincham captures American prisoners stealing medical supplies from a British secret hoard, Ryan orders Fincham to distribute the medicines to the seriously ill prisoners.\n\nHe infuriates Fincham by revealing an escape plan to Battaglia in exchange for prisoners being treated better. When Battaglia refuses to issue new clothing, Ryan orders prisoners to strip and burn their filthy uniforms. Battaglia throws Ryan into the sweat box as punishment.\n\nWhen Italy [[Armistice of Cassibile|surrenders]], the guards flee; the British promptly try Battaglia as a [[war criminal]]. He portrays himself as a broken man who has repudiated fascism. Rather than executing him, Ryan sentences him to the sweat box.\n\nA German fighter plane overflies the camp, forcing Ryan and the men to flee into the Italian countryside with Oriani's help. They hide out in some ruins while Ryan attempts to contact Allied forces. The next morning, the Germans recapture the prisoners and load them onto a northbound train. Fincham assumes Oriani betrayed them until he is found severely battered aboard the train's prisoner carriage. The Germans then shoot all ill prisoners. Fincham blames Ryan for letting Battaglia live, and derogatively calls him \"''[[von]]'' Ryan\". The train travels to Rome, where a German officer, Major von Klemment, takes command.\n\nRyan pries up the railcar floorboards. That night, when the train stops, Ryan, Fincham, and Lt. Orde sneak out and kill several guards. They free a boxcar load of POWs, who help them kill the remaining guards whose uniforms they then don as a disguise. Ryan and Fincham capture von Klemment and his mistress, Gabriella. As the train moves out, another train follows. Von Klemment reveals that the second train is carrying German troops and is on the same schedule. Further, von Klemment is to receive orders at each railway station. A German-speaking American chaplain, Captain Costanzo, impersonates the German commander to ensure their passage through the next station in [[Florence]].\n\nThrough documents received in Florence, they learn that both trains are headed towards [[Innsbruck]], Austria. Through trickery and a quickly forged typewritten order, the prisoners switch their train onto a different line at [[Bologna]]. The troop train continues on toward Innsbruck. Von Klemment and Gabriella are kept bound and gagged, but they escape at a stop, killing Orde. Both are shot by Ryan and the train proceeds.\n\nLater, German commanders learn of the train's diversion and begin queries. That night the train stops at what is thought to be a clearing and the men get off to head for safety; aircraft, which Ryan identifies as [[Lancaster bombers]] appear overhead and begin bombing the area. Ryan orders everyone back on the train. The train restarts and passes an [[Oil terminal|oil storage]] yard being bombed by the Allied aircraft. Several cars catch fire, and the train must stop to aid wounded and release burning boxcars.\n\nWith three dead and some sixty wounded, Oriani and the train's Italian engineer tell Ryan and Finchum that the only option is to reroute the train at [[Milan]] to neutral Switzerland. [[Waffen-SS]] troops, led by Colonel Gortz, have discovered the earlier ruse and await the train, but are slowed when Oriani and the men disable a signal box at Milan, knocking out the track diagrams inside the control center. The prisoners reroute the train northwest through manual switching and drive straight through without stopping.\n\nWhen the train diagrams are finally reactivated, Gortz realizes he has been outmaneuvered and leads troops in pursuit. As the [[Alps]] appear, the prisoner train is attacked by German aircraft, rocket fire collapsing boulders onto a section of track. The POWs replace the damaged rail and then pry loose more rail behind them in hopes of overturning the approaching German train, but the Germans see the sabotage and stop in time.  As the Germans race up from behind, Ryan, Fincham, and others stay behind to hold them off, but many are killed in the battle, including Bostick. The prisoner train moves out as the men run for the moving rear platform with the Germans in pursuit. Most make it onto the train, but Ryan is killed by gunfire still running for the train as it approaches Switzerland.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Col. Joseph L.

The novelist David Westheimer had been a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] during World War II. He witnessed the bombing of [[Bolzano]] in 1943 from a box car.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Books and Authors: Military Held a Culprit Projected Challenges Derring-Do Movie Book Reissued|date=Dec 20, 1963|work=New York Times|page=27}}</ref> Martin Levin, reviewing the book for the ''[[New York Times]]'', said the novel \"has everything for the screen but the camera directions.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=A Reader's Report|author=MARTIN LEVIN.|date=Jan 12, 1964|work=New York Times|page=BR24}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe novel was a best seller and film rights were bought by 20th Century Fox for a reported $125,000.<ref>{{Cite news|title='Von Ryan's Express' Will Star Sinatra: Robson to Produce War Story; Taylor as 'Young Cassidy'|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=Apr 16, 1964|work=Los Angeles Times|page=C8}}</ref> The studio assigned Saul David to produce and [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] to direct.

Fox, in a bid to prove that they were still able to make films on an epic scale, shot extensively on location in Europe and built a full-scale prison camp as opposed to shooting on a [[backlot]]. It was producer [[Saul David (producer)|Saul David]]'s first film for Fox. He followed it with ''[[Our Man Flint]]'', ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', and ''[[In Like Flint]]''.\n\n===Shooting===\nRumours of a [[personality clash]] between star [[Frank Sinatra]], who was flown by helicopter to the set, and director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] were not enough to cause problems as the film was shot with relatively little trouble. However, Sinatra did insist that the ending of the film be altered, ending any chance of a sequel. Sinatra also insisted the film be shot in [[Panavision]] rather than Fox's [[CinemaScope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/Widescreen/wingcs8.htm |title=The CinemaScope Wing 8 |website=The American WideScreen Museum |access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe film score was written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].<ref>Clemmensen, Christian.

Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pasarelas sobre la v\u00eda del tren.jpg|thumb|The railway bridge in 2015.]]\n''Von Ryan's Express'' achieved [[Verisimilitude (narrative)|reality]] using aircraft, trains and wheeled vehicles photographed on location along with the occasional model. The aircraft alluded to as ''Messerschmitts'' were indeed  [[Messerschmitt Bf 108]]s. A majority of the film was shot on location around [[Northern Italy]] in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] and [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station]] in [[Florence]] (in reality is [[Roma Ostiense railway station]]<ref>[http://www.reelstreets.com/films/von-ryans-express/ Reelstreets \u2013 Von Ryan's Express]</ref>). The [[Ferrovie dello Stato]]/Italian State Railway closely cooperated on the production, as reflected in the film's closing acknowledgment credit, providing a complete train headed by the specially-bulled up [[FS Class 735]].236. The train which the Nazis commandeer to pursue the escaping POWs is headed by a [[Franco-Crosti boiler]]-fitted Class 743.\n\nThe railway sequence at the film's conclusion, however, was shot in the [[Caminito del Rey]] walkway in the limestone gorge of [[El Chorro]] and in the adjacent railway bridge, near [[M\u00e1laga]] in [[Andaluc\u00eda]], Spain.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GnaTOvs0Ek0C&lpg=PT596&dq=von%20ryan's%20express%20spain&pg=PT596#v=onepage&q&f=false Travel Andalusia, Spain]</ref><ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/cjcZGvytKaU Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170208161241/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjcZGvytKaU Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjcZGvytKaU&t=3m26s| title = Historia del Caminito del Rey | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> This switch from filming in Italy was probably done as the bridge looked more suitably attractive for presenting the final set piece than anything that could be found on the Italian rail network. The train featuring in these sequences was laid on by the '''RENFE'''/Spanish National Railways and altered to resemble the Italy-based train. Interiors were completed at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles. The POW camp (Campo Concentramento Prigioneri di Guerra 202) was also built in the front lot of the Studios.<ref>Saul, David.
