Michael Straczynski]] and directed by [[Mike Vejar]]. Though shot as a pilot for a possible new series, it aired opposite NFL playoffs and the subsequent poor ratings led to it not being picked up.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nAs the [[Shadow War]] ended, hundreds of civilizations were devastated. It is up to the Interstellar Alliance, with the help of the [[Ranger (Babylon 5)|Rangers]], to rebuild what the great war had destroyed and to hold peace among the worlds of the ISA.\n\nIn the year 2265, David Martel ([[Dylan Neal]]), a Ranger, is given the command of a twenty-year-old Ranger starship, ''Liandra'', and is asked to escort a ''Valen''-class cruiser to a secret location carrying several diplomats, including Ambassador [[G'Kar]] ([[Andreas Katsulas]]). Upon arrival, the two craft are attacked on behalf of an unknown, mysterious, and ancient force known only as [[The Hand (Babylon 5)|The Hand]] whose lethal power is far greater than any previously known to [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth]] or any other world in the Interstellar Alliance.\n\n{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}<!-- full plot needed -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dylan Neal]] as David Martell\n* [[Andreas Katsulas]] as [[G'Kar]]\n* [[Alex Zahara]] as Dulann\n* [[Myriam Sirois]] as Sarah Cantrell\n* [[Dean Marshall]] as Malcolm Bridges\n* Warren Takeuchi as Kitaro \"Kit\" Sasaki\n* Jennie Rebecca Hogan as Na'Feel\n* [[Mackenzie Gray]] as Kafta\n* David Storch as Tafeek\n* Enid-Raye Adams as Firell\n* Gus Lynch as Tirk\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020408231234/http://www.scifi.com/b5rangers/index.html ''Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers''] official site ([[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]).
