It stars [[Campbell Scott]], [[Jesse Eisenberg]] (in his feature film debut), [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]] and [[Jennifer Beals]]. The film follows Roger Swanson, a womanizing ad executive who takes his nephew Nick out for a night in the city after the young man asks him for advice on experience with women.\n\nThe film debuted at the inaugural [[Tribeca Festival]] to critical acclaim and won the award for Best Narrative Feature for Kidd. It went on to win the FIRESCI Prize and award for Best Debut Film at the [[59th Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]]. ''Roger Dodger'' was given a limited release by [[Artisan Entertainment]] on October 25, 2002. Both Scott and Eisenberg received awards notices, with Scott winning a [[National Board of Review|National Board of Review Award]] for Best Male Lead and Eisenberg earning a [[Gotham Awards|Gotham Award]] nomination for Breakthrough Actor.  \n\n==Plot==\nAfter cynical [[New York City]] advertising copywriter Roger Swanson is dumped by his on-again/off-again girlfriend, Joyce, who is also his boss. His painful workday is further complicated by the unexpected arrival of his 16-year-old nephew, Nick. After asking to spend the night at Roger's, Nick reveals that he has come to ask for help in hopes of ditching his virginal status, Nick begs Roger for a lesson in the art of seduction. Embittered Roger then takes on the role of a nocturnal drill sergeant in an imaginary war between the sexes, starting Nick's training at an upscale singles bar. There they meet two beautiful women who turn out to be less malleable than Roger expects.\n\nAlthough this first attempt to seduce women is unsuccessful, Nick chooses to continue the quest, which takes them to a party at Joyce's. There they find Joyce's secretary drunk and consider taking advantage of her vulnerable state. Once in the bedroom, Nick's conscience gets the better of him and he allows her to fall asleep untouched.\n\nWith Roger spinning out of control and Nick's window of opportunity closing rapidly, they agree to go with the \"Fail Safe\" plan. This turns out to be an underground brothel. At the underground location Roger finds he cannot let Nick lose his virginity in such an emotionally barren atmosphere, and drags him back to his apartment to sleep things off. The following day, Roger hears his sister's message from his answering machine saying that no one has seen her son Nick for two days, so Roger tells Nick to call Nick's mom. Nick travels back to [[Ohio]], but a while later, Roger shows up unexpectedly to tutor Nick and his classmates on their home turf, bonding with the younger men in a more potent way in an atmosphere populated by adolescent peers.\n\nAt the closing, it is left open which way Nick will go.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Roger Swanson\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Nick\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Joyce\n* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Andrea\n* [[Jennifer Beals]] as Sophie\n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Donovan\n* Mina Badie as Donna\n* [[Chris Stack]] as Chris\n\n== Production ==\nDylan Kidd said his idea for the film \"started with the idea of a guy who feels like he can tell everyone else what they're thinking. It was based on a friend of mine, who in college had this strange ability to go up to strangers and take their psychology apart in minute detail. It struck me as disturbing but also very compelling.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=September 22, 2021 |title=Dylan Kidd on writing & directing \"Roger Dodger\" |url=https://www.fastcheapfilm.com/fast-cheap-interview-blog/dylan-kiddnbsp-on-writing-amp-directing-roger-dodger-crlsz |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=fastcheapfilm.com |language=en-US}}</ref> Kidd decided to make the lead character work in advertising because Roger \"actually ends up bringing that kind of rhetoric into the singles arena.

While Nick is funny and earnest, and generates many laughs, the movie is really about Roger--about his attempts to tutor his nephew in a lifestyle that has left the older man lonely and single. The film is not just a lot of one-liners but has a buried agenda, as the funny early dialogue slides down into confusion and sadness. There is a lesson here for Nick, but not the one Roger is teaching.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Accolades ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n!Award\n!Category\n!Nominee\n!Result\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2002|Chicago Film Critics Awards]]\n|Most Promising Filmmaker\n|[[Dylan Kidd]]\n|{{won}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Susman |first=Gary |date=January 10, 2003 |title='Heaven' Sent |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,406841,00.html |url-status=dead |access-date=2022-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020182338/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,406841,00.html |archive-date=October 20, 2012}}</ref>}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Gotham Independent Film Awards 2003|Gotham Independent Film Awards]]\n|[[Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Performer|Breakthrough Actor]]\n|[[Jesse Eisenberg]]\n|{{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oei |first=Lily |date=2003-07-29 |title=IFP eyes 6 thesps for breakthrough kudos |url=https://variety.com/2003/film/news/ifp-eyes-6-thesps-for-breakthrough-kudos-1117890043/ |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Director|Breakthrough Director Award]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Dylan Kidd\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[18th Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Awards]]\n|[[Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]\n|{{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite news |date=2002-12-12 |title=Independent Spirit Awards nominees announced |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/search/mmx-19599_lgcy,0,1314957.story?page=1 |url-status=dead |access-date=2022-10-05 |archive-url=https://archive.ph/20130127143315/http://www.latimes.com/search/mmx-19599_lgcy,0,1314957.story?page=1 |archive-date=2013-01-27}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature|Best First Feature]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead|Best Male Lead]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Campbell Scott]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[National Board of Review Awards 2002|National Board of Review Awards]]\n|[[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n|{{won}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |title=2002 Archives |url=https://nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2002/ |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=National Board of Review |language=en-US}}</ref>}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[2002 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|New York Film Critics Circle Awards]]\n|[[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best First Film|Best First Film]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Dylan Kidd\n|{{won}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scott |first=A.
