It is the seventh installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[Cary Elwes]]. It also featured the final film appearance of [[Chester Bennington]] before his death in 2017. The plot follows a man who, after falsely claiming to be a survivor of one of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s games in order to become a local celebrity, finds himself part of a real game where he must save his wife. Meanwhile, John Kramer's ex-wife Jill Tuck informs the [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] that rogue detective [[Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.\n\nA sequel<!-- Not the same eighth installment as \"Jigsaw\" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on October 22, 2010, by Lionsgate, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]] has survived his test after [[Saw (2004 film)|sawing off his foot]] to escape the bathroom, using a steam pipe to [[Cauterization|cauterize]] his ankle stump. Five years later, another game takes place in a [[Home improvement center|home improvement storefront]] at a shopping center. [[List of Saw characters#Brad, Dina, and Ryan|Brad and Ryan]] are bound to opposite sides of a worktable secured to a sliding carriage with buzzsaws while their mutual lover Dina is suspended above a third saw. The men have 60 seconds to shove the saws into their opponent to save Dina, who had manipulated both of them into fulfilling her needs by committing crimes. Realizing her betrayal, Ryan and Brad reach a truce and allow Dina to be cut in half by the third saw.\n\nAfter witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival from his trap, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] seeks help from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] detective [[List of Saw characters#Matt Gibson|Matt Gibson]] and offers to incriminate Hoffman in exchange for protection and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. Gibson initially places Jill in a safehouse, but moves her to a holding cell in the police station after Hoffman makes contact with her. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a gang of [[skinhead]] [[white supremacists]] and places them in a trap at an abandoned junkyard that kills all four of them. He also captures [[List of Saw characters#Bobby Dagen|Bobby Dagen]], a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival from a [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] trap. Bobby awakens in an abandoned [[psychiatric hospital]] and is informed that he has one hour to save his wife [[List of Saw characters#Joyce Dagen|Joyce]], who is chained to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Bobby's progress. After escaping his cage hanging over a floor of spikes, Bobby navigates his way through the asylum, attempting to complete his other tests and to rescue [[List of Saw characters#Nina|Nina]], his publicist; [[List of Saw characters#Suzanne|Suzanne]], his lawyer; and [[List of Saw characters#Cale|Cale]], his best friend, all who knew of Bobby's lies and aided him in fabricating his story. Despite his efforts, all of them are killed in their respective traps. Bobby reunites with his wife after pulling out two of his own teeth to obtain the combination for the lock on the door to her room. \n\nGibson discovers the location of Bobby's game and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Finding Hoffman's command center, Gibson realizes that he gained access to the police station during the games, having been brought into the morgue in a body bag with the intent of hunting down Jill. Before Gibson can warn the station, he and the officers accompanying him are killed by an automatic [[turret gun]]. Meanwhile, Bobby is forced to re-enact his supposed escape from the trap he claimed to have survived, by driving two hooks through his [[pectoral muscles]] and hoisting himself above the ceiling to deactivate Joyce's trap. However, before Bobby is able close the circuit, the hooks tear through his skin and he falls, unable to continue. As the timer expires, a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her. Elsewhere, Hoffman infiltrates the police station, killing everyone in his path before reaching Jill, and executing her with the original reverse bear trap.\n\nHoffman then destroys his workshop and begins to leave town but is subdued by three pig-masked figures; the leader reveals himself to be Dr. Gordon, having acted as Jigsaw's secret accomplice. Fulfilling a final request from John to take immediate action in protecting Jill, Gordon shackles Hoffman in the same bathroom where he was tested. He throws away the hacksaw he had used to sever his foot and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jill Tuck\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Lawrence Gordon\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as Bobby Dagen\n* [[Chad Donella]] as Detective Matt Gibson\n* [[Gina Holden]] as Joyce Dagen\n* Laurence Anthony as Officer Rogers\n* [[Dean Armstrong]] as Cale\n* [[Naomi Snieckus]] as Nina\n* Rebecca Marshall as Suzanne\n* James Van Patten as Dr. Adam Heffner\n* [[Sebastian Pigott]] as Brad\n* [[Jon Cor]] as Ryan\n* Anne Greene as Dina\n* [[Chester Bennington]] as Evan\n* Dru Viergever as Dan\n* [[Gabby West]] as Kara\n* Benjamin Clost as Jake\n* Kevin McGarry as Charlie\n* [[Kim Schraner]] as Officer Palmer\n* [[Olunik\u00e9 Adeliyi]] as Sidney\n* [[Ishan Morris|Ish Morris]] as Alex\n* [[Carlos Patricio D\u00edaz|Carlos D\u00edaz]] as Coroner Worker\n* Elizabeth Rowin as Sara\n* [[Christine Simpson]] as Donna Evans\n* [[Rachel Wilson]] as Mother\n* [[Tanedra Howard]] as Simone\n* [[Shauna MacDonald (Canadian actress)|Shauna MacDonald]] as Tara Abbott\n* [[Joanna Douglas (actress)|Joanna Douglas]] as Joan\n* Janelle Hutchison as Addy\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Mallick Scott\n* Larissa Gomes as Emily\n* Kevin Rushton as Trevor\n}}\nArchival footage of [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Bahar Soomekh]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Franky G]], [[Leigh Whannell]], and [[Michael Emerson]], as [[Amanda Young]], Lynn Denlon, Daniel Matthews, Xavier Chavez, Adam Stanheight, and Zep Hindle respectively are seen in the film as well.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Saw VII filming Metro Hall Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A scene being constructed at the [[Metro Hall]] of Toronto in April 2010]]\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in July 2009 that [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Saw VII'' and announced [[David Hackl]] would return to direct, his last film being ''[[Saw V]]''.

The storyline for a ''Saw VIII'' was combined into ''Saw VII''; this decision was primarily due to [[Saw VI#Box office|''Saw VI''{{'s}} below average box office performance]].<ref name=\"SawVIII\"/><ref name=\"QA With Patrick Melton\"/>  On July&nbsp;22, 2010, in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' the producers confirmed that ''Saw VII'' would officially end the film series.<ref name=\"usatoday\"/> Burg told [[Reuters]] that, \"In every ''Saw'' movie, we left questions open and in ''Saw VII'' we answer every question the audience has ever had\".

Melton explained that, \"He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the ''Saw'' films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things a whole bunch right in the middle of it\".<ref name=\"Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2\"/>\n\n''Saw 3D'' was originally intended to be two separate films. According to Melton and Dunstan, \"It was our original intention to make the final ''Saw'' in two parts, but when ''[Saw] VI'' didn't do so well, the studio got nervous and we were only allowed to make one more.\"<ref name=\"2Parts\">{{Cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404119/previous-saw-entry-supposed-split-two-exclusive/|title=The Previous 'SAW' Entry Was Supposed to be Split in Two!

Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name=\"IGN Interview about 3D\"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, \"If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name=\"budget\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name=\"bd7\"/><ref name=\"Saw VII Wraps\"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/>\n\n[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010]]\nWhen determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name=\"Collider\"/> Dunstan added that \"It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an \"interesting experience\".<ref name= \"Tobin\" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot \"more tedious and longer\".<ref name=\"pressUK\"/> Flannery described (inaccurately, as the final production includes many to-viewer shock shots) the 3D aspect as being \"[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that.

She told [[VH1]], \"They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary!

This is not the ninth film in the ''Saw'' franchise. There easily could be a ''Saw IX'' that follows ''Jigsaw''.
