It consists of four episodes, each by one of the directors, all about a different aspect of morality and love in modern times in the style of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].\n\n==Plot==\n===''Renzo e Luciana''===\nDirected by [[Mario Monicelli]]. Written by [[Giovanni Arpino]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Suso Cecchi d'Amico]] and Mario Monicelli. Music by [[Piero Umiliani]]. With [[Marisa Solinas]] and Germano Giglioli.\n\nIn ''Renzo e Luciana'' (''Renzo and Luciana''), a young couple tries to hide their marriage and the wife\u2019s supposed pregnancy from the draconian rules at their place of employment, which has banned female employees from getting married and having children. Their efforts \u2013 both at their shared home (having temporarily moved into her family's crowded apartment), and at work (where they go so far as to pretend not to know each other) \u2013 causes pressure to mount on the couple. Their hope is to make it through until they have managed to save some money to move out, and are dependent on Renzo going to night school to become an accountant. Finally their life together has some privacy, but they are increasingly separated by their respective shifts: he returns home from work just when she has to leave to go there.\n\nThis first episode was only included in the Italian distribution of the film. Out of solidarity toward Monicelli, the other three directors did not go to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for the presentation of the film.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===''Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio''===\nDirected by [[Federico Fellini]]. Written by Fellini, [[Ennio Flaiano]] and [[Tullio Pinelli]]. Music by [[Nino Rota]]. With [[Peppino De Filippo]] and [[Anita Ekberg]].\n\nIn ''Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio'' (''The Temptation of Dr Antonio''), Dr Antonio Mazzuolo, a middle-aged man, has taken it upon himself to be the protector of Rome's morality and law and order from what he sees as vice, crime and immorality throughout the city. The doctor (in his tiny Fiat equipped with a police spotlight) wages his one-man crusade \u2013 shining the spotlight at lovers in parked cars, or bounding on stage of a cabaret, ordering the stage crew (which includes a smiling police officer) to shut the lights, as he closes the curtain behind a line of bewildered chorus girls. He admonishes the audience to 'go home, and spend (their) money' in a 'better way instead of seeing this filth.' His anger knows no bounds when a provocative billboard of Anita Ekberg with the tag line \"drink more milk\" is put up in a park near his residence. Little does he know how the billboard will impact his life. Throughout the film, children are heard singing the jingle \"Bevete pi\u00f9 latte, bevete pi\u00f9 latte!\" (\"Drink more milk!\"). The image begins to haunt him with hallucinations in which Ekberg appears as a temptress. After his delirium culminates in throwing a spear at Ekberg's image, he is found collapsed on top of the billboard and transported away in an ambulance to the children's song.\n\n===''Il Lavoro''===\nDirected by [[Luchino Visconti]]. Written by Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Visconti. Music by Nino Rota. With [[Romy Schneider]], [[Tomas Milian]], and [[Romolo Valli]].\n\n''Il Lavoro'' (''The Job''), is about an aristocratic couple. The husband is caught by the press visiting prostitutes. After saying she intends from then on to work for her income, the wife demands payment from her husband for her sexual services, to which he agrees.\n\n===''La Riffa''===\nDirected by [[Vittorio De Sica]]. Written by [[Cesare Zavattini]]. Music by [[Armando Trovajoli]]. With [[Sophia Loren]].\n\nIn ''La Riffa'' (''The Raffle''), a timid lottery winner is entitled to one night with the attractive Zoe (Sophia Loren). Zoe, however, has other plans.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marisa Solinas]] as Luciana\n* Germano Giglioli as Renzo\n* [[Peppino De Filippo]] as Dr. Antonio Mazzuolo\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as herself\n* [[Romy Schneider]] as Pupe\n* [[Tomas Milian]] as Ottavio\n* [[Romolo Valli]] as Zacchi\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Zoe\n\n==Artistic legacy==\nAn orchestrated version of the song \"Bevete pi\u00f9 latte\", from ''Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio'', was one of 13 tracks, recorded by Italian band [[Piccola Orchestra Avion Travel]] and arranged by Fabrizio France, for their 2009 album \"Nino Rota, L'Amico Magico,\" released to mark the 30th anniversary of the 1979 death of composer [[Nino Rota]].{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\n\"Bevete pi\u00f9 latte\" was also used in the song \"Milk Sheik\" by singer [[Lizzy Mercier Descloux]] on her album ''[[Mambo Nassau]]'' from 1981.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0055805}}\n* {{AllMovie title|6460}}\n\n{{Federico Fellini}}\n{{Luchino Visconti}}\n{{Vittorio De Sica}}\n{{Mario Monicelli}}\n{{Nino Rota}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1962 films]]\n[[Category:1962 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Federico Fellini]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Luchino Visconti]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mario Monicelli]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vittorio De Sica]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Carlo Ponti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Armando Trovajoli]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nino Rota]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Piero Umiliani]]\n[[Category:Films set in Milan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Cesare Zavattini]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Federico Fellini]]\n[[Category:French anthology films]]\n[[Category:Giovanni Boccaccio]]\n[[Category:Italian anthology films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
