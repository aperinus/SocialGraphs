The film stars [[Christian Bale]] and is based on the true story of [[German Americans|German-American]] pilot [[Dieter Dengler]], who was shot down and captured by villagers sympathetic to the [[Pathet Lao]] during an American military campaign in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Steve Zahn]], [[Jeremy Davies]], Pat Healy, and [[Toby Huss]] also have principal roles. The film project, which had initially come together during 2004, began shooting in [[Thailand]] in August 2005. Despite critical acclaim, the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn February 1966, while on a combat mission, Lt. [[Dieter Dengler]], a German-born [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] pilot in squadron [[VA-145 (U.S. Navy)|VA-145]], flying from the carrier [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger'']], is shot down in his [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]] over Laos. He survives the crash, only to be captured by the [[Pathet Lao]]. Dengler is offered leniency by the province governor, if he will sign a document condemning America, but he refuses. Dengler is tortured and taken to a prison camp. There he meets his fellow prisoners: American pilots [[Eugene DeBruin|Gene DeBruin]] and [[Duane W. Martin]], Hong Kong Chinese radio operator Y.C. To, Procet and Thai Air America freight employee [[Phisit Intharathat|Pisidhi Indradat]], some of whom have been captives for years.\n\nDengler immediately plans to escape, but receives only grudging approval from the others. All are suffering from malnutrition, unhygienic conditions and abuse by the guards. After some months the food supply worsens further, and they learn that the starving guards are planning to kill them and return to their village, so the prisoners agree to put the long-prepared plan into action. This involves escaping through a weakened place in the perimeter fence, dividing into two groups, circling the perimeter fence in opposite directions, converging on the guard hut during the lunch hour to overwhelm the guards, and contacting the American forces for rescue.\n\nDue to one party of prisoners disobeying Dengler's orders, the escape does not go according to the plan and nearly all the guards end up being shot. With insufficient equipment and supplies, the prisoners disperse in the jungle. Dengler and Martin form one group, while Gene and To leave together to an uncertain fate.\n\nDengler and Martin try to reach the [[Mekong River]] to cross over into Thailand, fashioning a crude raft, but are caught in rapids and a waterfall. After losing their raft, Dengler and Martin are soon found by a mob of angry villagers, who kill Martin. Dengler escapes and flees back into the jungle, hiding from the pursuing villagers. A few days later, he is rescued by an American helicopter. Back at the U.S. compound he is taken to, Dengler is kept isolated in a hospital for debriefing due to the classified nature of his mission. He is visited by some of the men from his squadron, who covertly take him back to his ship, where he is welcomed as a hero by the crew.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Christian Bale 2009.jpg\n| width1 = 177\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  Zahn, Steve (2008).jpg\n| width2 = 190\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Christian Bale (left) and Steve Zahn (right) starred in the film\n}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Lt.

A few months after being captured in 1966, Dengler and other POWs who were being held captive targeted July 4 for their mass escape. The prisoners had overheard the guards in mid-June planning to kill all of them and return to their villages because a drought had caused a severe shortage of food and water. The POWs decided they could not wait any longer to make their escape.<ref name=Historynet>Henderson, Bruce. [http://www.historynet.com/dieter-denglers-great-escape-from-laotian-pow-camp.htm \"Dieter Dengler's great escape from Laotian POW Camp.\"] ''HistoryNet.com'', July 12, 2010. Retrieved: December 13, 2015.</ref>\n\nDengler and fellow POW Duane W. Martin made their eventual run from their prisoner camp into dense jungle. Martin was killed by an enraged Laotian villager, but Dengler was able to continue on. Two rescue helicopters were scrambled to rescue Dengler, dropping a cable down to the human figure they spotted below. They winched him on board, but fearful that he could be a Viet Cong suicide bomber, the crew pinned the man to the helicopter floor and searched him. His backpack turned out to contain only a half-eaten snake. Dengler, exhausted by his ordeal, whispered: \"I am an American pilot. Please take me home.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nDirector Herzog's fascination with the cruelties of man and nature led his interest in the 1997 documentary ''[[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]]'' about Dengler's experiences in captivity. He chose to revisit the story in a cinematic theatrical version with Christian Bale portraying Dengler. Compared to ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'', ''Rescue Dawn'' understates the suffering of the prisoners, including omitting some of the worst torture experienced by Dengler. Herzog did not want to glorify the prisoners' woes, as the film is rated PG-13.<ref name=Slate>Winter, Jessica.

In preparation for the roles, the actors playing the prisoners spent several months losing weight. Since weight gain is accomplished more quickly than weight loss, the film was shot in reverse, with Bale fully regaining his weight during the course of the shoot. The film includes the first major use of digital visual effects in Herzog's career; the shots of Dengler's flight while airborne were created digitally. The crash itself, however, is live action.<ref name=\"DVD\">[[Werner Herzog|Herzog, Werner]] (Director). (2007). ''Rescue Dawn'' [Motion picture].

Herzog says that he found the writing to be difficult with seven characters, and that six was a more manageable number.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nJerry DeBruin, brother of Gene DeBruin, created a website critical of Herzog and the film, claiming that several characters and events have been falsely portrayed. On the same website, [[Phisit Intharathat|Pisidhi Indradat]], the other survivor of the group, has also stated that the film contains inaccuracies. The website claims that during his imprisonment, DeBruin taught his cellmates English, shared his food, and even returned after escaping to help an injured cellmate. In the film, Dengler formulates the entire escape plan, along with uncuffing the handcuffs with the nail. According to Jerry DeBruin, the prisoners waited for two weeks before telling him of the plan, which had been devised before his arrival.<ref name=\"rescuedawnthetruth\">[http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com \"Family, friends of Gene DeBruin critical of Herzog film.\"] ''Rescue Dawn: The Truth''.
