Filming began in [[South Africa]] in September 2014.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 11 September 2015. [[Bleecker Street (company)|Bleecker Street]] distributed the film in cinemas in the United States with a [[limited release]] on {{nowrap|11 March}} 2016 and then a wide release on 1 April.\n\nIt is the last live-action film to feature [[Alan Rickman]], who died in January 2016 (his last film overall, ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'', features his voice acting only). The film was dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], where Alia Mo'Allim, a young girl, twirls a [[hula hoop]] in her backyard.\n\n[[British Army]] Colonel Katherine Powell wakes up and hears that an undercover British/Kenyan agent has been murdered by the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] group. From [[Northwood Headquarters]] she takes command of a mission to capture three of the ten highest-level Al-Shabaab leaders, who are meeting in a safehouse in Nairobi.\n\nA multinational team works on the capture mission, linked together by video and voice systems. [[Aerial surveillance]] is provided by a [[USAF]] [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] controlled from [[Creech Air Force Base]] in [[Nevada]] by Second Lieutenant Steve Watts. Undercover Kenyan field agents, including Jama Farah, use short-range [[ornithopter]] and [[insectothopter]] cameras to link in ground intelligence. Kenyan [[Special Operations Regiment (Kenya)|special forces]] are positioned nearby to make the arrest. Facial recognition to identify human targets is done at [[Joint Intelligence Center Pacific]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii. The mission is supervised in the United Kingdom by a [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room|COBRA]] meeting that includes British Lieutenant General Frank Benson, two full government ministers and a ministerial under-secretary.\n\nFarah discovers that the three high-level targets are now arming two [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] for what is presumed to be an attack on a civilian target. Powell decides that the imminent bombing changes the mission objective from \"capture\" to \"kill\". She requests Watts to prepare a precision [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missile]] attack on the building, and solicits the opinion of her British Army legal counsel. To her frustration, her counsel advises her to seek approval from superiors. Benson asks permission from the COBRA members, who fail to reach a decision and refer the question up to the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|UK Foreign Secretary]], presently on a trade mission to [[Singapore]]. He does not offer a definite answer and defers to the [[United States Secretary of State]], who immediately declares the American suicide bomber an enemy of the state. The Foreign Secretary then insists that COBRA take [[due diligence]] to minimise [[collateral damage]].\n\nAlia, who lives next door, is now near the target building selling her mother's bread.  The senior military personnel stress the risk of letting would-be suicide bombers leave the house. The lawyers and politicians involved in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] argue the personal, political and legal merits of and justification for launching a Hellfire missile attack in a friendly country not at war with the US or UK, with the significant risk of collateral damage. Watts can see the more direct risk of little Alia selling bread outside the targeted building, and they seek to delay firing the missile until she moves.\n\nFarah is directed to try and buy all of Alia's bread so she will leave, but after paying her his cover is blown and he is forced to flee without collecting it. Seeking authorisation to execute the strike, Powell orders her risk-assessment officer to find parameters that will let him quote a lower 45% risk of civilian deaths. He re-evaluates the strike point and assesses the probability of Alia's death at 45\u201365%. She makes him confirm only the lower figure, and then reports this up the chain of command. The strike is authorised, and Watts fires a missile. The explosion destroys the building and injures Alia, but one conspirator survives. Watts is ordered to fire a second missile, which strikes the site just as Alia's parents reach her. They rush Alia to a hospital, where she is pronounced dead.\n\nIn the London situation room, the under-secretary berates Benson for killing from the safety of his chair. Benson counters that he has been on the ground at five suicide bombings and adds as he is leaving, provoking her to tears: \"Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n'''United Kingdom'''\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] Katherine Powell, a UK military intelligence officer<ref name=\"white\">{{cite journal | last=White | first=James | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=42545 | title=Exclusive First Look At Helen Mirren In Eye In The Sky | journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=22 October 2014 | access-date=23 October 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] Frank Benson, [[Royal Marines]].
