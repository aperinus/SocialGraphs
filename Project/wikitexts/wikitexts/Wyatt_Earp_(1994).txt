Corral gunfight. Starring [[Kevin Costner]] in the title role, it features an [[ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] that includes [[Gene Hackman]], [[Mark Harmon]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[JoBeth Williams]], [[Mare Winningham]] and [[Jim Caviezel]] in one of his earliest roles.\n\nThe film was released a mere six months after the similar ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', and received mixed to negative reviews, critical of the film's length and plot but praising its production values.<ref name=\"Wyatt Earp\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1052698-wyatt_earp/ |title=Wyatt Earp |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=November 9, 2017 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |archive-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205004942/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1052698-wyatt_earp |url-status=live }}</ref> Unlike ''Tombstone'', it was a [[box-office bomb|box office failure]].<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], teenaged [[Wyatt Earp]] lives on his family farm in [[Pella, Iowa]], while his older brothers [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[James Earp|James]] serve with the [[Union Army]]. Wyatt attempts to run away, intending to lie about his age and join the war, but his father catches him. His brothers return home at the war's end, with James gravely wounded, and the family moves west. Wyatt sees a man killed during a gunfight, and vomits at the sight.\n\nYears later, Wyatt works out west as a wagon driver, also serving as a referee for fights, and finds himself at odds with a bully. Wyatt and the bully come to the point of fighting, with the bully intending to shoot him, but Wyatt disarms and defeats him, taking his gun.\n\nReturning home to [[Missouri]], Wyatt marries his childhood sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland. They move into their own house, and he begins working as a policeman. Months later, his pregnant wife dies from [[typhoid fever]]. After staying by her side through the illness, Wyatt becomes deeply depressed. Burning their home and possessions, he begins drinking and drifts from town to town, landing in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. He robs a man and steals his horse, but is captured. With Wyatt facing certain hanging, his father bails him out of jail, telling him to never return to Arkansas.\n\nWorking as a buffalo hunter, Wyatt befriends [[Bat Masterson]] and his brother [[Ed Masterson]]. Years pass, and Wyatt becomes a deputy marshal in [[Wichita, Kansas]], building a reputation as a good lawman. He is recruited to work as a deputy in [[Dodge City]], with a lower salary but earning extra money for every arrest. Wyatt becomes romantically involved with a prostitute, [[Mattie Blaylock]], and the Mastersons join him as deputies. Wyatt believes Ed is too passive, but the Dodge City council fires Wyatt for his [[excessive force]], appointing Ed to take his place. Wyatt begins working for the railroad, capturing outlaws.\n\nPursuing outlaw [[Dave Rudabaugh]], Wyatt is introduced to gunman and gambler [[Doc Holliday]] in [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], and the two become friends. Holliday assists Earp in locating Rudabaugh, whom he dislikes tremendously. Wyatt receives word that Ed has been killed, having shot and killed both his assailants before dying in the street. Wyatt returns to Dodge City to help bring law and order, during which time Wyatt kills his first man, witnessed by actress [[Josephine Marcus|Josie Marcus]]. Despite his brothers' wives\u2019 and Mattie's protests, Wyatt moves the family to [[Tombstone, Arizona]] and immediately finds himself at odds with the outlaw Cowboy gang. He becomes romantically involved with Josie Marcus, angering her boyfriend [[Johnny Behan|Sheriff Behan]] and stressing his relationship with Mattie, and becomes the subject of rumor about town.\n\nWyatt and his brothers [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] and Virgil arrest several Cowboys, and Virgil takes over as marshal following the murder of [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]]. Tension builds between the brothers and the gang as Wyatt breaks up several altercations involving the Cowboys, particularly [[Ike Clanton]], and Holliday swears his loyalty to Wyatt, whom he considers his only real friend. The [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] makes the brothers very unpopular in town. Virgil is ambushed and wounded, and Morgan is killed. In the [[Earp Vendetta Ride|Vendetta Ride]], Wyatt and his friends take revenge against the remaining Cowboys.\n\nMany years later, Wyatt and Josie mine for gold in [[Alaska]]. A young man on the same boat recognizes Wyatt, and recounts a story in which Wyatt had saved the boy's uncle, \"[[Michael O'Rourke (gambler)|Tommy Behind-The-Deuce]]\". Wyatt says to Josie, \"Some people say it didn't happen that way\", to which she responds, \"Never mind them, Wyatt. It happened that way.\"\n\nAn [[epilogue]] states that Holliday died six years later in a hospital in [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]]. Members of the Clanton gang continued to die mysteriously for years after Morgan's murder. Josie and Wyatt's marriage lasted 47 years until Wyatt died at age 80 in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Wyatt Earp]]\n** [[Ian Bohen]] as teenage Wyatt\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Doc Holliday]]\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Nicholas Porter Earp]]\n* [[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]] as [[James Earp]]\n* [[Linden Ashby]] as [[Morgan Earp]]\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Warren Earp]]\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as [[Michael O'Rourke (gambler)|Tommy 'Behind-The-Deuce' O'Rourke]]\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as [[Ike Clanton]]\n* [[Joanna Going]] as [[Josephine Earp|Josie Marcus]]\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as [[Johnny Behan]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Virgil Earp]]\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Allie Earp\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as [[Ed Masterson]]\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as [[Big Nose Kate]]\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as [[Bat Masterson]]\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Bessie Earp\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as [[Mattie Blaylock]]\n* [[James Gammon]] as Mr. Sutherland\n* [[Karen Grassle]] as Mrs. Sutherland\n* [[Rex Linn]] as [[Frank McLaury]]\n* Gabriel Folse as [[Billy Clanton]]\n* [[Mackenzie Astin]] as Francis O'Rourke\n* Randle Mell as [[John Clum]]\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as [[Tom McLaury]]\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Urilla Sutherland\n* [[Lewis Smith (actor)|Lewis Smith]] as [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Virginia Earp\n* [[Alison Elliott]] as Lou Earp\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Sally\n* [[Martin Kove]] as Ed Ross\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCostner was originally involved with the film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', another film about Wyatt Earp, written by [[Kevin Jarre]] of ''[[Glory film|Glory]]''. However, Costner disagreed with Jarre over the focus of the film (he believed that the emphasis should have been on Wyatt Earp rather than the many characters in Jarre's script) and left the project, eventually teaming up with Kasdan to produce his own Wyatt Earp project. The film was also originally meant to be a six-hour miniseries until Kevin Costner joined the cast. Costner proceeded to use his then-considerable clout to convince most of the major studios to refuse to distribute the competing film, which affected casting on the rival project.<ref>Beck, Henry Cabot. \"[http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/images/column/93006/russell.pdf The \"Western\" ''Godfather''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162648/http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/images/column/93006/russell.pdf |date=July 5, 2008 }}\".

It involves many of the same characters and much of the same story, but little of the tension and drama. It's a rambling, unfocused biography of Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner), starting when he's a kid and following his development from an awkward would-be lawyer into a slick gunslinger. This is a long journey, in a three-hour film that needs better pacing.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wyatt-earp-1994 |title=Wyatt Earp Movie Review & Film Summary (1994) |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=24 June 1994 |access-date=16 November 2016 |archive-date=February 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207194437/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wyatt-earp-1994 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the cast and production values, but remarked, \"If you're going to ask an audience to sit through a three-hour, nine-minute rendition of an oft-told story, it would help to have a strong point of view on your material and an urgent reason to relate it.
