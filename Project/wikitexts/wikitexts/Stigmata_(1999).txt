While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals a rosary from the father's hand. The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her daughter, Frankie Paige, living in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nShortly afterward, Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated, doctors cannot find the cause. Frankie asks a priest if he is Andrew Kiernan, the scientist, priest and investigator. When the priest says he is Father Derning, the lights in the train flash and Frankie is whipped from behind by an unseen force. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and Andrew is sent to investigate.\n\nAndrew interviews Frankie, believing her wounds may also be stigmata. When she tells him she is an [[atheist]], Andrew tells her that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]] that Jesus received during the crucifixion. Frankie begins to research on her own what the cause could be. Her head begins to bleed, the third stigmata wound caused by the [[Crown of Thorns]]. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, and then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language.\n\nAndrew takes Frankie to Father Derning's church, and the Vatican translates what she was yelling in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The next morning, Andrew returns to her apartment to find her writing on the wall, now covered in Aramaic. Frankie talks in a male voice, speaking [[Italian language|Italian]]. Wounds appear in her feet, the fourth wound of stigmata. Andrew emails photographs of Frankie's apartment wall to the Vatican, where Brother Delmonico recognizes the words and deletes the pictures. He tells Andrew the words are from a document the church found that looked to be an entirely new [[gospel]]. Father Dario shows the pictures to Cardinal Daniel Houseman, who also recognizes them. Delmonico phones Marion Petrocelli and tells him the missing gospel has been found in Pittsburgh.\n\nAndrew goes to Frankie's apartment to find the wall she wrote on painted over, and Frankie attempts to seduce him. When Andrew rejects her, she attacks him and denounces his beliefs in a male voice, ending with Frankie [[levitating]] off the bed, crying tears of blood. Houseman and Dario arrive with Derning and take Frankie to another church, sending Andrew to Derning's. At Derning's church, Andrew meets Petrocelli, who tells him the words Frankie has been writing are part of a document found outside [[Jerusalem]] they believed to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus. Petrocelli, Delmonico and Alameida were assigned to translate it, but Houseman ordered them to stop. Alameida refused and stole the document to continue translating it alone, having been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by Houseman.\n\nPetrocelli tells Andrew that the document was Jesus telling his disciples that the [[Kingdom of God]] is in all of us and not confined to churches. Petrocelli tells Andrew that Alameida suffered from stigmata. Andrew races to the church where Frankie is, while Houseman and Dario attempt to perform an [[exorcism]] on Frankie. Frankie shouts at them in a male voice, and Houseman attempts to strangle her. Andrew stops him, and the room is set on fire. Now believing Frankie is possessed by Alameida's spirit, Andrew offers to be Alameida's messenger instead. He walks unharmed through the fire to retrieve Frankie, bidding Alameida's spirit to depart in peace. Some time later, Andrew returns to Belo Quinto and finds the original documents for the lost gospel in Alameida's church.\n\nText just before the end credits describes the discovery of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], stating that the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the document as a gospel and considers it [[heresy]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Frankie Paige\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Father Andrew Kiernan\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Cardinal Daniel Houseman\n* [[Nia Long]] as Donna Chadway\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Marion Petrocelli\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as Father Dario\n* [[Jack Donner]] as Father Paulo Alameida\n* [[Thomas Kopache]] as Father Durning\n* [[Dick Latessa]] as Father Gianni Delmonico\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Jennifer Kelliho\n* [[Patrick Muldoon]] as Steven\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Dr. Reston\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDevelopment was first announced in January 1998, when Frank Mancuso Jr. announced his intention to produce a supernatural thriller helmed by Rupert Wainwright <ref name=\"MacusoJrReupsMGM\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/mancuso-jr-reups-at-mgm-for-5-years-1117466948/|title=       Mancuso Jr. reups at MGM for 5 years |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Stigmata'', produced on a $29 million budget, premi\u00e8red at the box office in the number one position, earning $18.3 million in its first weekend, becoming the first film in five weekends to outgross ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' at the box office.
