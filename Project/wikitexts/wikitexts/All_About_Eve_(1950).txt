Mankiewicz]], and produced by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. It is based on the 1946 short story \"The Wisdom of Eve\" by [[Mary Orr]], although Orr does not receive a screen credit.\n\nThe film stars [[Bette Davis]] as Margo Channing, a highly regarded but aging [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star, and [[Anne Baxter]] as Eve Harrington, an ambitious young [[fan (aficionado)|fan]] who maneuvers herself into Channing's life, ultimately threatening Channing's career and her personal relationships. The film co-stars [[George Sanders]], [[Celeste Holm]], [[Gary Merrill]], and [[Hugh Marlowe]], and features [[Thelma Ritter]], [[Marilyn Monroe]] in one of her earliest roles, [[Gregory Ratoff]], [[Barbara Bates]] and [[Walter Hampden]].\n\n''All About Eve'' held its world premiere in New York City on October 13, 1950.<ref name=\"AFI Catalog\">{{AFI film|26204}}</ref> Praised by critics at the time of its release, ''All About Eve'' received a record 14 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.<ref group=\"notes\">This feat was only matched by the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and the 2016 film ''[[La La Land]].''</ref> and won six, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

After a performance of Margo's latest play ''Aged in Wood,'' Margo's close friend Karen Richards ([[Celeste Holm]]), wife of the play's author Lloyd Richards ([[Hugh Marlowe]]), brings in besotted fan Eve Harrington ([[Anne Baxter]]) to meet Margo. Eve tells the group gathered in Margo's dressing room{{snd}}Karen, Lloyd, and Margo's maid Birdie Coonan ([[Thelma Ritter]]){{snd}}that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to [[New York City]] after seeing her perform in [[San Francisco]]. She tells an engrossing story of growing up poor in [[Wisconsin]] and losing her young husband Eddie in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|South Pacific]] during [[World War II]]. Margo is moved and befriends Eve, takes her into her home and hires her as her assistant, upsetting Birdie.\n\n[[File:Anne Baxter in All About Eve trailer.jpg|thumb|right|187px|[[Anne Baxter]] in wig and costume as Eve Harrington]]\n\nEve quickly manipulates her way into Margo's life, acting as her secretary and adoring fan. She places a long-distance phone call to Margo's boyfriend Bill Sampson ([[Gary Merrill]]) when Margo forgets his birthday. Margo becomes increasingly distrustful and bitter toward Eve, particularly after she catches Eve taking a bow to an empty theater while pretending to wear Margo's costume. Margo asks her producer Max Fabian ([[Gregory Ratoff]]) to hire Eve at his office, but instead, Eve manages to become Margo's [[understudy]] without Margo's knowledge.\n\nAs Margo's irritation grows, Karen feels sorry for Eve. In hopes of humbling Margo, Karen arranges for her to miss a performance so that Eve may perform in her place. Eve invites the city's theater critics to attend the performance &ndash; including the acerbic Addison DeWitt ([[George Sanders]]) &ndash; which is a triumph for her. Later that night, Eve tries to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Instead, Addison takes her under his wing and interviews her for a column harshly criticizing Margo for resisting younger talent.\n\nMargo and Bill announce their engagement at dinner with the Richardses. Eve summons Karen to the ladies' room and, after first appearing regretful, delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd for the lead role of Cora in Lloyd's next play or she will reveal Karen's role in Margo's missed performance. Before Karen can talk with Lloyd, Margo announces to everyone's surprise that she does not wish to play Cora, as she is too old for the role''.''\n\nEve is cast as Cora. Just before the premiere of the new play in [[New Haven]], Eve presents Addison with her next plan: to marry Lloyd, whom she claims is in love with her, so that he can write plays in which she can be the star''.'' Angered with Eve's antics, Addison reveals that he knows that her backstory is a lie; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she was never married, and she had been paid to leave town over an affair with her boss. With this information, Addison blackmails Eve, whom he says now \"belongs\" to him.\n\nMonths later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. At an awards banquet, she thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen, while all four stare back at her coldly. Eve skips a party in her own honor and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe ([[Barbara Bates]]), a teenage fan who has slipped into her apartment and fallen asleep. Phoebe (her chosen name as she admits, not her real name) professes her adoration and tries to insinuate herself into Eve's life, offering to pack Eve's trunk for Hollywood. Eve invites her to stay the night rather than take the long trip back to Brooklyn by subway. While Eve rests, Addison brings Eve's award to the door. He sees that Phoebe will play the same role in Eve's life that Eve had played in so many others' lives. After Addison leaves, Eve asks who was at the door, Phoebe lies and says that it was a taxi driver.  Phoebe, then out of sight of Eve, wears the elegant robe that Eve wore to the banquet and poses in front of a three-paned mirror, holding the award and bowing.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:EveEveMargotCasswellWitt.jpg|right|thumb|275px|A young and unknown [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Miss Casswell in a scene with [[Anne Baxter]], [[Bette Davis]] and [[George Sanders]]]]\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Margo Channing\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Eve Harrington\n* [[George Sanders]] as Addison DeWitt\n* [[Celeste Holm]] as Karen Richards\n* [[Gary Merrill]] as Bill Sampson\n* [[Hugh Marlowe]] as Lloyd Richards\n* [[Thelma Ritter]] as Birdie Coonan\n* [[Gregory Ratoff]] as Max Fabian\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Claudia Casswell\n* [[Barbara Bates]] as Phoebe\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Aged Actor ([[Sarah Siddons]] Award presenter)\n* [[Randy Stuart]] as Girl<ref name=\"ctmt110350\">{{cite news |last=Tin\u00e9e |first=Mae |title=Scintillating, Sharp - That's 'All About Eve' |work=Chicago Tribune |date=November 3, 1950 |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=39 |via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n* [[Craig Hill (actor)|Craig Hill]] as Leading Man<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* Leland Harris as Doorman<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* Barbara White as Autograph Seeker<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* Eddie Fisher as Stage Manager<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* William Pullen as Clerk<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* Claude Stroud as Pianist (at party)\n* [[Eugene Borden]] as Frenchman<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* [[Helen Mowery]] as Reporter<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n* [[Steven Geray]] as Captain of Waiters<ref name=\"ctmt110350\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe story of ''All About Eve'' originated in an anecdote related to [[Mary Orr]] by actress [[Elisabeth Bergner]]. While performing in ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' during 1943 and 1944, Bergner allowed a young fan to become part of her household and employed her as an assistant, but later regretted her generosity when the woman attempted to undermine her. Referring to her only as \"the terrible girl\", Bergner related the events to Orr, who used it as the basis for her short story \"[[The Wisdom of Eve]]\" (1946). In the story, Orr gives the girl an even more ruthless character and allows her to succeed in stealing the older actress's career and the husband of the unnamed female narrator. Bergner later confirmed the basis of the story in her autobiography ''Bewundert viel, und viel gescholten'' (''Greatly Admired and Greatly Scolded'').\n\n[[File:Joseph L. Mankiewicz (1950).jpg|thumb|[[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] in 1950]]\n\nIn 1949, Joseph Mankiewicz was considering a story about an aging actress and, upon reading \"The Wisdom of Eve,\" felt that the conniving girl would be a useful element. He sent a memo to [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] saying it \"fits in with an original idea [of mine] and can be combined. Superb starring role for [[Susan Hayward]].\" Mankiewicz presented a [[film treatment]] of the combined stories under the title ''Best Performance.'' He changed the main character's name from Margola Cranston to Margo Channing and retained several of Orr's characters \u2013 Eve Harrington, Lloyd and Karen Richards and Miss Casswell \u2013 while removing Margo's husband completely and replacing him with a new character, Bill Sampson. The intention was to depict Margo in a new relationship and allow Eve to threaten Margo's professional and personal lives. Mankiewicz also added the characters Addison DeWitt, Birdie Coonan, Max Fabian and Phoebe.\n\nZanuck was enthusiastic and provided numerous suggestions for improving the screenplay. In some sections, he felt that Mankiewicz's writing lacked subtlety or provided excessive detail. He suggested diluting Birdie Coonan's mistrust of Eve so the audience would not recognize Eve as a villainess until much later in the story. Zanuck reduced the screenplay by about 50 pages and chose the title ''All About Eve'' from the opening scene in which Addison DeWitt says that he will soon tell \"more of Eve ... All about Eve, in fact.\"<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs, Sam (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xUFplyZZAZsC&pg=PA224 ''All About \"All About Eve\"''].

Margo had been originally conceived as genteel and knowingly humorous, but with the casting of Davis, Mankiewicz revised the character to introduce abrasive qualities. Mankiewicz praised Davis for her professionalism and for the caliber of her performance.\n\n[[Anne Baxter]] had spent a decade in supporting roles and had won the 1946 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]].'' She won the role of Eve after [[Jeanne Crain]], the first choice, became pregnant. Crain was at the height of her popularity and had established a career playing likable heroines; Zanuck believed that she lacked the \"bitch virtuosity\" required by the part and that audiences would not accept her as a deceitful character.\n\nMankiewicz greatly admired [[Thelma Ritter]] and wrote the character of Birdie Coonan for her after working with her on ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' in 1949. As Coonan is the only character immediately suspicious of Eve Harrington, Mankiewicz was confident that Ritter would contribute a shrewd characterization that cast doubt on Eve and provided a counterpoint to the more theatrical personalities of the other characters. [[Marilyn Monroe]], relatively unknown at the time, was cast as Miss Casswell, referred to by DeWitt as a \"graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art\". Monroe won the part after a lobbying campaign by her agent,<ref name=miller>{{cite web| last=Miller| first=Frank| url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67044/all-about-eve#articles-reviews?articleId=189049| title=All About Eve| website=Turner Classic Movies| access-date=April 24, 2022}}</ref> despite Zanuck's initial antipathy and belief that she was better suited to comedy.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}<ref name=miller /> The inexperienced Monroe was cowed by Davis, and it took 11 takes to complete the scene in the theater lobby; when Davis barked at her, Monroe left the set to vomit.<ref name=miller /> Smaller roles were filled by [[Gregory Ratoff]] as the producer Max Fabian, [[Barbara Bates]] as Phoebe and [[Walter Hampden]] as the host of the award ceremony.<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Hampden was the president of the prestigious [[The Players (New York City)|Players Club]] in New York, a club for actors that gives a lifetime achievement award.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Bette Davis and Gary Merrill in All About Eve.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]]  ]]\n\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $3.1&nbsp;million in receipts in the United States during its release,<ref name=\"1950DomesticRevenue\">{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficereport.com/database/1950.shtml| title=Top 20 Films of 1950 by Domestic Revenue| website=Box Office Report| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615023703/http://www.boxofficereport.com/database/1950.shtml| archive-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref> more than double its original budget of $1.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book| last=Solomon| first=Aubrey| year=1988| title=Twentieth Century Fox: A Corporate and Financial History| location=Lanham, Maryland| publisher=Scarecrow Press| page=245| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIZwZOz8LHsC&q=all+about+eve| isbn=978-0810842441}}, {{OCLC|856785920}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=Rudy| last=Behlmer| title=Behind the Scenes: The Making Of...| publisher=Samuel French| year=1990| page=208| isbn=978-0573606007}}</ref>  To date the film has a cumulative gross of $8.4&nbsp;million,<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1950/0AAE.php Box Office Information for ''All About Eve''].

The fair amount of subtlety employed in ''All About Eve'' is seen as primarily being due to [[Production Code]] restrictions on the depiction of homosexuals in the media during this time.<ref name=\"Culture\"/><ref name=\"Cold War Femme\">Corber, Robert. [http://glq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/11/1/1 \"Cold War Femme: Lesbian Visibility In ... All About Eve\"]. ''GLQ Journal'' [[Duke University]], 2005 11(1):1\u201322; {{doi|10.1215/10642684-11-1-1}}</ref> However, notwithstanding those restrictions, Corber cites the film as but one example of a recurrent theme within American film of the homosexual as an emotionally bereft predator.<ref name=\"Culture\" /> The documentary ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' also affirms this theme to which Corber refers, including citing numerous other film examples from the same Production Code time period in which ''All About Eve'' was made.<ref name=\"Culture\"/><ref name=\"The Celluloid Closet\">Russo, Vito (1987). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DH1ZAAAAMAAJ&q=all+about+eve&pgis=1 ''The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies'']. New York: Harper & Row. {{ISBN|978-0-0609-6132-9}}, {{OCLC|15630614}}</ref>\n\nAnother important theme of the film, in terms of war politics and sexuality, involves the post-[[World War II]] pressure placed upon women to resume \"traditional\" female roles. This is illustrated in the contrast between Margo's mockery of Karen Richards for being a \"happy little housewife\" and her lengthy and inspired monologue, as a reformed woman later, about the virtuousness of marriage, including how a woman is not truly a woman without having a man beside her. This submissive and feminine Margo is contrasted with the theatricality, combativeness, and egotism of the earlier career woman Margo, and the film's two homosexual characters. Margo quips that Eve should place her award \"where her heart should be\", and Eve is shown bereft at the end of the film. At dinner, the two married couples see Eve and Addison in a similarly negative light, with Margo wondering aloud what schemes Eve was constructing in her \"feverish little brain\". Additionally, Eve's utility as a personal assistant to Margo early in the film, which is a subtle construct of a same-sex intimate relationship, is decried by Birdie, the same working-class character who immediately detected the theatricality in Eve's story about her \"husband\". Birdie sees such agency as being unnatural, and the film contrasts its predatory nature (\"studying you like a blueprint\") with the love and warmth of her later reliance upon Bill. The pressure to acquiesce agency and more highly value patriarchy, following the return of men from the war, after having been shown propaganda promoting agency such as [[Rosie the Riveter]] and after having occupied traditionally male roles such as bomb-building factory worker, was deemed \"the problem that has no name\" by well-known [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]].<ref name=Rosie>Hunt, Heather (1999).
