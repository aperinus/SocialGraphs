The film stars [[Abigail Breslin]] as Casey Welson, a teenage girl kidnapped by a [[serial killer]] and [[Halle Berry]] as Jordan Turner, a [[9-1-1]] operator, still suffering emotionally from a prior botched 9-1-1 call, who receives Casey's call. [[Morris Chestnut]], [[Michael Eklund]], [[Michael Imperioli]], and [[David Otunga]] also star. The story was originally envisioned as a television series, but D'Ovidio later rewrote it as a film. Filming began in July 2012 and spanned a period of 25 days, with all scenes being shot in [[California]], mainly [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]].\n\nA screening of ''The Call'' was held at the Women's International Film Festival hosted at the Regal South Beach theater on February 26, 2013. [[TriStar Pictures]] released it to theatres on March 15, 2013. Considered to be [[high-concept]] by many reviewers, the film proved a commercial success, grossing over $68 million against budget of $13 million. Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and Best Actress at the [[BET Awards]] while Michael Eklund won Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Motion Picture at the [[Leo Awards]].  Critics gave the film mixed reviews, but praised Berry and Breslin's performances and the film's suspense. It is currently the most successful WWE produced film.\n\n==Plot==\nSeasoned [[LAPD]] [[9-1-1]] operator Jordan Turner receives a call from 15-year-old Leah Templeton, fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home. Calmly advising her to hide, when the call is disconnected, Jordan calls back. The ring gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him, but he responds, \"It's already done,\" and hangs up.\n\nThe next day, a television report confirms that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected, Jordan decides she can no longer handle field calls.\n\nSix months later, she trains 9-1-1 operators. Teenager Casey Welson is kidnapped from a mall parking garage by a man named Michael, forced into the trunk of a car. Using a [[TracFone|disposable phone]] she calls 9-1-1. Brooke, a rookie operator, receives the call but can't handle it, so Jordan takes over. However, since Casey is using a 'burner' phone, her exact location cannot be determined by GPS.\n\nAs Michael drives, Jordan gets Casey to knock out a [[tail light]] and signal people nearby. A woman who sees Casey's arm calls 9-1-1 on a phone with GPS, allowing the police to narrow the search, but Michael notices the caller and quickly loses her. When Casey discovers paint in the trunk, Jordan has her pour the paint out of the taillight hole. This attracts the attention of another driver, Alan Denado, but Michael knocks him out with a shovel, and assuming him to be dead, stuffs him into the trunk of his black [[Lincoln Town Car]] with Casey.\n\nOn the road again, Alan awakens in his trunk, screaming uncontrollably, so Michael pulls over and stabs him to death. When he stops for gas, Casey tries to crawl out of the trunk and scream for help. When the gas attendant tries to open the car door, Michael douses him with gasoline and burns him alive. Meanwhile, the police find Michael's [[Toyota Camry]] abandoned in a parking lot, and discover his identity through his fingerprints.\n\nArriving at their destination, Michael removes Casey from the trunk. He finds the phone in her pocket, connected to 9-1-1. Jordan informs him that his identity, Michael Foster, is uncovered, advising him to surrender and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, \"It's already done\", making Jordan realize Michael also killed Leah.\n\nMeanwhile, her boyfriend, officer Paul Phillips, and others raid Michael's home, finding only his wife and children. Seeing a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, Paul recognizes Casey's resemblance. Additionally, the house in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael's wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody.\n\nMichael begins to torture Casey slowly, strapping her to a foldable wheelchair, cutting her shirt off to her bra, and forcing her to take nitrous oxide. Determined to rescue her, Jordan drives to the cottage where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his [[leukemia]]-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor [[flagpole]]\u2014exactly what she'd heard in the background at the end of the 9-1-1 call. Next to the flagpole, she also finds a trap door where the primary house once stood. Jordan accidentally drops her cell phone down the cellar and climbs down to get it.\n\nJordan hides from Michael in the cellar. At one glance, his story is clear. He had [[incest]]uous feelings towards his sister Melinda and was distraught when she fell ill and died. Michael has a prop head he keeps there which he treats like his sister. He has been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sister's hair, which she lost from [[chemotherapy]].\n\nJordan soon finds Casey strapped to the wheelchair and attacks Michael as he begins to scalp her. She frees her and they try to escape, during which Casey stabs Michael in the back with scissors. He pursues them and they injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While knocked out, they tie him to a chair. When Michael regains consciousness, the women reveal they intend to leave him there to die. They will claim Casey had escaped and Jordan found her in the woods. People will believe that Michael simply disappeared. He first insults, then pleads, saying they cannot do this to him. Jordan replies with his own words, \"It's already done,\" and locks the door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{divcol}}\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Jordan Turner, a 9-1-1 operator\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Casey Welson, a kidnapped teenager\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Officer Paul Phillips, Jordan's boyfriend\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Michael Foster, Casey's kidnapper and Leah Templeton's killer\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Alan Denado, Michael's victim\n* [[David Otunga]] as Officer Jake Devan\n* [[Justina Machado]] as Rachel\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Marco\n* [[Roma Maffia]] as Maddy\n* Evie Thompson as Leah Templeton\n* [[Denise Dowse]] as Flora\n* [[Ella Rae Peck]] as Autumn\n* [[Jenna Lamia]] as Brooke\n* Ross Gallo as Josh\n* Shawnee Badger as Melinda Foster\n* [[Tara Platt]] as Female Trainee\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n{{quote box\n|width = 30em\n|border = 1px\n|align=right\n|bgcolor=#c6dbf7\n|fontsize = 85%\n|title_bg =\n|title_fnt =\n|title =\n|quote = \"I thought, 'That's a world we've never seen before in a film.'

He began to research the subject and visited the Los Angeles Metropolitan Communications Dispatch Center (MCDC). Finding the center, which has backup generators, bulletproof windows, and a moat surrounding the building, to be \"pretty amazing,\" he decided to shed light on what he viewed as a previously overlooked occupation. The story was originally conceptualized as a television series titled ''The Hive'' (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that \"the operators couldn't be the ones kicking in doors and going out into the field\" all the time. As a result, what was planned to be the pilot episode was expanded and revised as a movie.<ref name=\"Decker\">{{cite web |url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/62781/call-set-visit-report-part-one-writer-richard-dovidio-his-inspiration-research-and-more |author= Decker, Sean |date= January 14, 2013 |title= The Call Set Visit Report - Part One: Writer Richard D'Ovidio on His Inspiration, Research, and More! |publisher= Dread Central |access-date= March 17, 2013 |archive-date= March 11, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130311023647/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/62781/call-set-visit-report-part-one-writer-richard-dovidio-his-inspiration-research-and-more |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dwight-brown/the-call_b_2875451.html?ir=Entertainment |author= Brown, Dwight |date= March 15, 2013 |title= The Call |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |quote= Jordan (Berry) works in the L.A. 911 call center.

D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, \"I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" /> Berry remarked, \"I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite news |last= Grant |first= Kimberly |title= Berry, Chestnut Expound on ''The Call'' Roles - and more |work= South Florida Times |location= Fort Lauderdale |date= March 13, 2013 |url= http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12684&Itemid=187 |access-date= March 17, 2013 |archive-date= April 11, 2013 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130411195045/http://www.sfltimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12684&Itemid=187 |url-status= live }}</ref> D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters\u2014the operator and the caller\u2014believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: \"Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen.\"<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nChestnut, who plays Phillips, a police officer and Turner's boyfriend, prepared by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe what it is like to be an officer in a squad car<ref name=\"Grant\" /> and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work.<ref name=\"Decker\" /> She told a ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' interviewer, \"You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing.

With a low budget of $13 million, they settled on [[Ottawa, Ontario]], where director Anderson had just finished another project. However, the [[California Film Commission]] (CFC) called back nine months later and informed them that the waiting list had been largely cleared and that they now qualified for $1.9 million in tax deduction. According to Producer Michael Helfant, they were \"literally days from starting to put down a deposit.\" Berry was reportedly pleased with the news, wanting to stay in Los Angeles and the CFC helped secure film locations for the project.<ref name=\"Verrier\">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Verrier|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/20/business/la-fi-ct-onlocation-20130320|title=A Fateful Call Keeps Filming of 'The Call' in L.A.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 20, 2013|access-date=August 17, 2013|archive-date=June 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623145848/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/20/business/la-fi-ct-onlocation-20130320|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith a crew of roughly 120 persons, filming took a total of 25 days, spanning from July to August 2012. Car chase scenes were shot at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and a [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] office building was modeled as the emergency dispatch center. The latter was also used for the scenes in which Welson is locked in the trunk of a car. Other filming locations include the [[Burbank Town Center]] on Magnolia Boulevard in [[Burbank, California]], [[Santa Clarita, California]] and the 170 Highway.<ref name=\"Verrier\" /> At one point, Berry was rushed to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] after falling headfirst on concrete while shooting a fight sequence. A spokesperson for Berry confirmed that she suffered a minor head injury and was taken to the hospital as a precaution, but she checked out healthy and was released.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nBerry told interviewer Kimberly Grant, \"The hard part for me was to try to stay connected to Phillips and Welson.\" This was because, Grant writes, \"she had to spend an entire day reading 21 pages of dialogue, rattling off in quick succession 911-operator jargon, that would be cut and edited to fit the film... In film terms, that means Berry performed for 21 minutes straight with no breaks, not an easy feat for any actor.\" Though she enjoyed working with Chestnut,<ref name=\"Zwecker\" /> Berry told Grant that it was difficult being unable to see her co-stars for most of the film: \"That was my constant challenge; to stay on such an emotional level [as Jordan], so that I would be on the same level as they [i.e., Casey and Officer Phillips] were. I used that feeling of frustration and of being stuck to fuel my character.\"<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe score of the film is composed by John Debney.
