Considered the quintessential work of [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist ([[Werner Krauss]]) who uses a [[Sleepwalking|somnambulist]] ([[Conrad Veidt]]) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.\n\nThe script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during [[World War I]]. The film makes use of a [[frame story]], with a prologue and epilogue combined with a [[Plot twist|twist ending]]. Janowitz has said this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film's design was handled by [[Hermann Warm]], [[Walter Reimann]] and [[Walter R\u00f6hrig]], who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one.\n\nThe film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany's obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill.  Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature.\n\n''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. The film was voted number 12 on the prestigious [[Expo 58#International film poll|Brussels 12]] list at the 1958 World Expo. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it arguably \"[[List of first horror films by country|the first true horror film]]\",<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> and film reviewer [[Danny Peary]] called it cinema's first [[cult film]] and a precursor for [[Art film|arthouse films]]. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and [[film noir]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn what appears to be a park, Francis sits on a bench with an older man and complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home. When a dazed woman passes them, Francis explains she is his \"fianc\u00e9e\" Jane and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of Francis's story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan, who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features Cesare, a [[Sleepwalking|somnambulist]]. The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is stabbed to death in his bed.\n\nThe next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari's sideshow attraction, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari's order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis's protests, Alan asks, \"How long shall I live?\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die at dawn!\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen, who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olsen, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame away from himself.\n\nAt night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis confirms that the criminal who confessed to the elderly woman's murder is still locked away and could not have been Jane's attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari's sideshow and discover that the \"Cesare\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows him and sees Caligari go into an insane asylum.\n\nUpon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The asylum director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a [[straitjacket]], and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.\n\nThe narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a [[Plot twist|twist ending]], Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes that she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as \"Dr. Caligari\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis's story. The asylum director announces that, now that he understands Francis's delusion, he is confident that he can cure him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Werner Krauss]] as Dr. Caligari\n* [[Conrad Veidt]] as Cesare\n* [[Friedrich Feh\u00e9r]] as Francis\n* [[Lil Dagover]] as Jane\n* [[Hans Heinz v.

This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked ''Caligari'' back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation.<ref name=\"Robinson46\" /> On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later.

Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the [[iris shot]] has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor.<ref name=\"Kracauer76\" />\n\n''Caligari'' continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic.<ref name=\"Brockmann60\" /> Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's ''From Caligari to Hitler'' (1947) and Lotte Eisner's ''The Haunted Screen'' (1974).<ref name=\"Budd1\" /><ref name=\"Scheunemann125\" /><ref name=\"Robinson56\">{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=56}}</ref> ''From Caligari to Hitler'' based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called ''Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story'',<ref name=\"Kracauer61\" /> which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of ''Caligari''.<ref name=\"Janowitz222\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=8}}</ref> Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: \"Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has ''Caligari'', and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social-psychological approach\".<ref name=\"Budd2\">{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=2}}</ref> Prior to the publication of ''From Caligari to Hitler'', few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer's argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler drastically changed attitudes about ''Caligari''. Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced,<ref name=\"Scheunemann126\" /><ref name=\"Robinson32\" /><ref name=\"Robinson56\" /><ref name=\"Budd2\" /> even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise,<ref name=\"Scheunemann126\" /><ref name=\"Budd2\" /> and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story.<ref name=\"Robinson56\" /> Eisner's book, meanwhile, placed ''Caligari'' into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s.<ref name=\"Scheunemann125\" /><ref name=\"Robinson56\" />\n\nFilm historian David Robinson claimed Wiene, despite being the director of ''Caligari'', is often given the least amount of credit for its production.<ref name=\"Robinson24\" /> He believes this is in part because Wiene died in 1938, closer to the release of the film than any other major collaborators, and was therefore unable to defend his involvement in the work while others took credit.<ref name=\"Robinson7\" /> In fact, Robinson argues ''Caligari'' ultimately hurt Wiene's reputation because his subsequent films did not match its success, so he is often wrongly considered \"a one-film director\" for whom ''Caligari'' was \"a lucky fluke\".<ref name=\"Robinson24\" />\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n===Authority and conformity===\n''Caligari'', like a number of [[Weimar culture|Weimar films]] that followed it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist.<ref name=\"Brockmann64\" /><ref name=\"Budd1\">{{Harvnb|Budd|1990a|p=1}}</ref> Kracauer said Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character \"stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|pp=64\u201365}}</ref> Likewise, John D.

Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight at the end of long, forbidding stairways.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=50}}</ref> Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft-harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical \"little men in white suits\".<ref name=\"Barlow43\" /> Only Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles, instead serving as, in Barlow's words, \"abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others\".<ref name=\"Barlow43-45\">{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=43\u201345}}</ref> Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds of people at the fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|pp=73\u201374}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=67}}</ref> Kracauer writes: \"''Caligari'' exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion\".<ref name=\"Kracauer74\">{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=74}}</ref>\n\nCaligari is not the only symbol of arrogant authority in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork.<ref name=\"Brockmann64\" /><ref name=\"Elsaesser63\" /> Film historian [[Thomas Elsaesser]] argues that Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare can be seen as a rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Elsaesser|2003|pp=63\u201364}}</ref> The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Caligari.<ref name=\"Brockmann64\" /><ref name=\"Kracauer72\">{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=72}}</ref> The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Elsaesser63\">{{Harvnb|Elsaesser|2003|p=63}}</ref> Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Caligari in the asylum.<ref name=\"Kracauer72\" />\n\nFrancis expresses resentment of all forms of authority, particularly during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him.<ref name=\"Barlow50-51\">{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority.<ref name=\"Barlow32\" /><ref name=\"Eisner18\" /> But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film:<ref name=\"Kracauer67\" /><ref name=\"Barlow32\" /><ref name=\"Peary51\" /><ref name=\"Brockmann65-66\" /> \"The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman.\"<ref name=\"Robinson32\" /> Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an \"instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen\" because commercial films had to \"answer to mass desires\".<ref name=\"Kracauer67\" /> Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracauer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less.<ref name=\"Barlow33\" /> David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.<ref name=\"Robinson33\">{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=33}}</ref>\n\n===Point of view and perception of reality===\nAnother major theme of ''Caligari'' is, Stephen Brockmann writes, \"the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity and hence the destabilization of the very notion of sanity itself\".<ref name=\"Brockmann64\" /> By the end of the film, according to Brockman, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman.<ref name=\"Brockmann61-62\">{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world.<ref name=\"LoBrutto62\" /> John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that \"the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|p=35}}</ref> The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story from the perspective of the narrator.<ref name=\"Kaes54\" /> At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems, to Barlow, to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Caligari takes on the role of persecutor.<ref name=\"Barlow50-51\" />\n\nHowever, the Expressionistic visual elements of the film are present not only in the main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality.<ref name=\"LoBrutto62\" /><ref name=\"Peary50\" /><ref name=\"Kracauer70\" /><ref name=\"Brockmann61-62\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=29}}</ref> For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative.<ref name=\"Barlow45-46\">{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either.<ref name=\"LoBrutto62\" /><ref name=\"Brockmann62\" /><ref name=\"Barlow45-46\" /> Instead, the film offers no true or normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis.<ref name=\"Hirsch54\">{{Harvnb|Hirsch|1981|p=54}}</ref> As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane.<ref name=\"Brockmann62\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=52\u201353}}</ref><ref name=\"Budd30\">{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=30}}</ref> Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy.<ref name=\"Budd30\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|pp=63\u201364}}</ref> In Brockman's words, \"In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance\".<ref name=\"Brockmann62\" /> Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a \"dream logic of repetition\" that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.<ref name=\"Budd30\" />\n\nBeyond Francis's individual circumstances, the use of the narrator's perspective in ''Dr. Caligari'' can be seen as reflective of a [[worldview]] of the screenwriters. Mayer and Janowitz were pacifists opposed to what Eisner described as the willingness of Germans to commit themselves to the dark forces, such as demoniac magic and supernatural powers, that led to death on the battlefield.<ref name=\"Eisner9\">{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|p=9}}</ref> Although he does not think it possible to reduce the narrative or the film to the beliefs of its makers, Eisner claims Francis can be seen as embodying the politics of Expressionism's anti-naturalism, through which a protagonist does not see the world objectively, but has \"visions\" that are abstracted from individuality and psychology.<ref name=\"Eisner11\u201312\">{{Harvnb|Eisner|1974|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> The framing device of an insane asylum, for Eisner, has a broader connotation as a statement on social reality in the context of the \"[[state of exception]]\". Here, Eisner claims, the militarist and imperialist tendency of [[monopoly capitalism]] is combined with what [[Sigmund Freud]] would later refer to as the longing for protection by a tyrannical father figure, or what Kracauer characterized as \"asocial authority\".<ref name=\"Eisner19\"/>\n\n===Double life===\nDuality is another common theme in ''Caligari''. Caligari is portrayed in the main narrative as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As a result of this duality, it is possible for the viewer to suspect a malevolent aspect of him at the conclusion of the film, even despite evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man.<ref name=\"Barlow49\" /> Even within the main narrative alone, Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kracauer|1947|p=248}}</ref> Additionally, the character is actually a double of the \"real\" Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and \"become Caligari\".<ref name=\"Kaes52\">{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|p=52}}</ref> Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of [[transference]] with his psychiatrist, as well as a [[Psychological projection|projection]] of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Caligari.<ref name=\"Kaes52\" /> The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master.<ref name=\"Barlow49\" /><ref name=\"Elsaesser63\" />\n\nSiegfried Kracauer said by coupling a fantasy in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority with a reality in which authority triumphs over Francis, ''Caligari'' reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it.<ref name=\"Kracauer67\" /> A contrast between levels of reality exists not only in the characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well.<ref name=\"Barlow48-49\">{{Harvnb|Barlow|1982|pp=48\u201349}}</ref> This, Barlow writes, \"reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos\".<ref name=\"Barlow48-49\" /> For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Caligari and Cesare.<ref name=\"Barlow48-49\" /> The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is especially prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes.<ref name=\"Barlow49\" />\n\n===Reflection on post-World War 1 Germany===\nCritics have suggested that ''Caligari'' highlights some of the neuroses prevalent in Germany and the Weimar Republic when the film was made,<ref name=\"Barlow51\" /><ref name=\"Brockmann63\">{{Harvnb|Brockmann|2010|p=63}}</ref> particularly in the shadow of World War I,<ref>{{Harvnb|Towlson|2014|p=7}}</ref> at a time when extremism was rampant, reactionaries still controlled German institutions, and citizens feared the harm the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would have on the economy.<ref name=\"Barlow51\" /> Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the paranoia and fear portrayed in the film were signs of things to come in Germany,<ref name=\"Kracauer67\" /><ref name=\"Brockmann63\" /> and that the film reflected a tendency in Germans to \"retreat into themselves\" and away from political engagement following the war.<ref name=\"Kracauer67\" /><ref name=\"LoBrutto63\" /> Vincent LoBrutto wrote that the film can be seen as a social or political analogy of \"the moral and physical breakdown of Germany at the time, with a madman on the loose wreaking havoc on a distorted and off-balanced society, a metaphor for a country in chaos\".<ref name=\"LoBrutto63\" />\n\nAnton Kaes, who called ''Caligari'' \"an aggressive statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception\", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, \"How long have I to live?\" reflected the trauma German citizens experienced during the war, as that question was often on the minds of soldiers and of family members back home concerned about their loved ones in the military. Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaes|2006|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an \"outstanding example of how 'fantastic' representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them\".<ref name=\"Elsaesser63\" />\n\n==Sequels, remakes and musical works==\n===Film===\nSeveral unsuccessful attempts were made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following ''Caligari''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to ''Caligari'' from [[Universum Film AG]] in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast [[Jean Cocteau]] as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style.<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|pp=57\u201358}}</ref> In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each separately attempted to obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake.<ref name=\"Budd32\" /><ref name=\"Robinson58\">{{Harvnb|Robinson|1997|p=58}}</ref> Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but \"in the revolutionary way the picture was produced\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=35}}</ref> However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films.<ref name=\"Budd32\" /><ref name=\"Robinson58\"/> Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by [[Fritz Lang]], but the project never came to fruition.<ref name=\"Robinson58\" /><ref name=\"Budd33\">{{Harvnb|Budd|1990b|p=33}}</ref> Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called ''Caligari II'', and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000.<ref name=\"Budd33\" />\n\nAround 1947, Hollywood agent [[Paul Kohner]] and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also planned a ''Caligari'' sequel; Matray and his wife [[Maria Solveg]] wrote a screenplay called ''The Return of Caligari''.<ref name=\"Budd33\" /> That script would have reimagined Caligari as a former Nazi officer and war criminal, but the film was never produced.<ref name=\"Robinson58\" /><ref name=\"Budd33\" /> In 1960, independent Hollywood producer [[Robert Lippert]] acquired the rights to ''Caligari'' from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called ''[[The Cabinet of Caligari]]'', which was released in 1962.<ref name=\"Budd33\" /> Screenwriter [[Robert Bloch]] did not intend to write a ''Caligari'' remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay.<ref name=\"Newman461\">{{Harvnb|Newman|2011|p=461}}</ref> The film had few similarities to the original ''Caligari'' except for its title and a plot twist at the end,<ref name=\"Robinson58\" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06EEDC103EE43BBC4E51DFB3668389679EDE |title=The Cabinet of Caligari (1962) |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |work=The New York Times |date=26 May 1962 |access-date=30 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531123940/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06EEDC103EE43BBC4E51DFB3668389679EDE |archive-date=31 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari.
