The screenplay was adapted by [[James Dickey]] from his 1970 [[Deliverance (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film was a critical and box office success, earning three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.\n\nWidely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted for a music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men playing \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\" on guitar with a banjo-picking country boy. It is also notorious for its brutal depiction of a sodomous rape, before which the victim is compelled to \"squeal like a pig\" by his attacker. In 2008, ''Deliverance'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFour [[Atlanta]] businessmen\u2014Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe and Drew Ballinger\u2014decide to canoe down a river in the remote [[Appalachia|northern Georgia wilderness]] before it is dammed. Lewis, an experienced outdoorsman, is the leader; his close friend Ed has been on several trips but lacks Lewis's machismo, while Bobby and Drew are novices. En route to their launch site, the men (Bobby in particular) are condescending towards the locals, who are unimpressed by the \"city boys\". At a local gas station, Drew, with his guitar, engages a young banjo-playing boy in a musical duel (\"[[Dueling Banjos]]\"). The duel is mutually enjoyable, and some of the locals break into dance at the sound of it. However, the boy does not acknowledge Drew when prompted for a celebratory handshake.\n\nThe four friends travel in pairs and their two canoes become separated. Ed and Bobby encounter a pair of [[mountain men]] emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun and missing two front teeth. Following a verbal altercation, Bobby is forced by the men to undress and the unarmed man [[Sodomy|sodomizes]] him, demanding he \"squeal like a pig\", while Ed is bound to a tree and held at gunpoint. Just as Ed is about to be raped, Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist using his [[bow and arrow]]; Ed retrieves the gun and the remaining mountain man flees into the woods. After a brief but hotheaded debate between Lewis and Drew, Ed and Bobby vote to side with Lewis's plan to bury the body and continue on as if nothing had happened. The four continue downriver but the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew shakes his head and falls headlong into the water \u2014 it is unclear why.\n\nThe canoes collide on the rocks, spilling the three remaining men into the river. One of the canoes is smashed. Lewis breaks his [[femur]] and the others are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge. Lewis, who believes Drew has been shot, encourages Ed to climb to the top of the gorge and dispatch the other mountain man, whom they believe to be stalking them from above. Ed reaches an overhang and hides out until morning, when a man appears above him with a rifle; Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill him, but falls backwards, stabbing himself with one of his own arrows in the process. The dead man seemingly has all his teeth, but on closer inspection, is revealed to be wearing dentures. Ed and Bobby weigh down the body in the river to ensure it will never be found, and when they encounter Drew's body downriver, they do the same.\n\nUpon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, they take Lewis to the hospital. The men carefully concoct a cover story for the authorities about Drew's death, lying about their ordeal to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. The sheriff does not believe them, but has no evidence to arrest them and tells the men to not do this kind of thing again and to never come back. The trio vow to keep their story of death and survival a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene, Ed awakens, startled by a nightmare in which a bloated hand rises from the lake.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus two named in synopsis, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Ed Gentry\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Lewis Medlock\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Bobby Trippe\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Drew Ballinger\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Mountain Man\n* [[Herbert \"Cowboy\" Coward]] as Toothless Man\n* [[James Dickey]] as Sheriff Bullard\n* [[Billy Redden]] as Lonnie, the banjo boy\n* [[Macon McCalman]] as Deputy Queen, whose brother-in-law is missing\n\nNed Beatty's wife, Belinda Beatty, and director John Boorman's son, [[Charley Boorman]], have brief appearances as the wife and young child of Jon Voight's character.\n\n==Production==\n\n''Deliverance'' was shot primarily in [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]] in northeastern Georgia. The canoe scenes were filmed in the [[Tallulah Gorge]] southeast of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]] and on the [[Chattooga River]]. This river divides the northeastern corner of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from the northwestern corner of [[South Carolina]]. Additional scenes were shot in [[Salem, South Carolina]].\n\nA scene was also shot at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church cemetery.

The two reconciled and became good friends, and Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff at the end of the film.\n\nThe inspiration for the Cahulawassee River was the [[Coosawattee River]], which was dammed in the 1970s and contained several dangerous whitewater rapids before being flooded by [[Carters Lake (Blue Ridge Mountains)|Carters Lake]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roper|first1=Daniel M.|title=The Story of the Coosawattee River Gorge|journal=North Georgia Journal|issue=Summer 1995|url=http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222063750/http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge |archive-date=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nCasting was by [[Lynn Stalmaster]].

I've never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk\".\n\n===\"Squeal like a pig\"===\nSeveral people have been credited with the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", the now-famous line spoken during the graphic rape scene. Ned Beatty said he thought of it while he and actor Bill McKinney (who played Beatty's rapist) were improvising the scene.<ref>Burger, Mark. (2006, March 19). \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/journalnow/access/1005939731.html?dids=1005939731:1005939731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+19%2C+2006&author=Mark+Burger+JOURNAL+ARTS+REPORTER&pub=Winston+-+Salem+Journal&edition=&startpage=1&desc=BEATTY+GIVEN+MASTER+OF+CINEMA+AWARD+%3B+CHARACTER+ACTOR+IS+A+VETERAN+OF+MORE+THAN+200+FILM+AND+TELEVISION+PRODUCTIONS BEATTY GIVEN MASTER OF CINEMA AWARD; CHARACTER ACTOR IS A VETERAN OF MORE THAN 200 FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS]\", ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'', Page B1<br />\"Regarding his debut film, ''Deliverance'' (1972), in which his character undergoes an unforgettably vivid sexual assault, Beatty said: 'The whole \"squeal like a pig\" thing ... came from guess who.'

As Boorman did not want to do that, he decided that the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", suggested by Rabun County liaison Frank Rickman, was a good replacement for the original dialogue in the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rabunhistory.org/history-sketches/frank-rickman-red-clay-michelangelo/|title= Rabun County Historical Society|publisher=www.rabunhistory.org|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref> Reynolds later recalled the scene as so uncomfortable cameramen avoided watching, and Reynolds opted to interrupt the filming. Reynolds said, \"I asked John Boorman, the director, 'Why did you let it go that long?' He said, 'I wanted to take it as far as I could with the audience, and I figured you'd run in when it got too far.'\"<ref name=\"ContactMusic2008\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack and copyright dispute==\nThe film's soundtrack brought new attention to the musical work \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\", which had been recorded numerous times since 1955. Only [[Eric Weissberg]] and Steve Mandel were originally credited for the piece. The onscreen credits state that the song is an arrangement of the song \"Feudin' Banjos\", showing Combine Music Corp as the copyright owner. Songwriter and producer [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]], who had written \"Feudin' Banjos\" in 1955, and recorded it with five-string banjo player [[Don Reno]], filed a lawsuit for songwriting credit and a percentage of royalties. He was awarded both in a landmark copyright infringement case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Country guitarist Arthur Smith dies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26885910 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref> Smith asked Warner Bros. to include his name on the official soundtrack listing, but reportedly asked to be omitted from the film credits because he found the film offensive.<ref>{{cite news |first=Terence |last=McArdle |title=Arthur Smith, guitarist who wrote 'Guitar Boogie' and 'Duelin' Banjos,' dies at 93 |url=http://wapo.st/1ihceud |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=15 April 2015 |date=6 April 2014 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nNo credit was given for the [[film score]]. The film has a number of sparse, brooding passages of music scattered throughout, including several played on a [[synthesizer]]. Some prints of the movie omit much of this extra music.\n\nBoorman was given a gold record for the \"Dueling Banjos\" hit single; this was later stolen from his house by the Dublin gangster [[Martin Cahill]].
