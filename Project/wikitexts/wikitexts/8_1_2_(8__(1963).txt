Stalled on his new [[science fiction]] film that includes thinly veiled autobiographical references, he has lost interest amidst artistic and marital difficulties. While attempting to recover from his anxieties at a luxurious spa, Guido hires a well-known critic to review his ideas for his film, but the critic blasts them. Guido has recurring visions of an Ideal Woman, which he sees as key to his story. His mistress Carla comes to visit him, but Guido puts her in a separate hotel. The film production crew relocates to Guido's hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to work on the film.\n\nGuido admits to a Cardinal that he is not happy. The Cardinal offers little insight. Guido invites his estranged wife Luisa and her friends to join him. They dance, but Guido abandons her for his production crew. Guido confesses to his wife's best friend Rosella that he wanted to make a film that was pure and honest, but he is struggling with something honest to say. Carla surprises Guido, Luisa, and Rosella outside the hotel, and Guido claims that he and Carla ended their affair years ago. Luisa and Rosella call him on the lie, and Guido slips into a fantasy world where he lords over a harem of women from his life, but a rejected showgirl starts a rebellion. The fantasy women attack Guido with harsh truths about himself and his sex life.\n\nWhen Luisa sees how bitterly Guido represents her in the film, she declares that their marriage is over. Guido's Ideal Woman arrives in the form of an actress named Claudia. Guido explains that his film is about a burned-out man who finds salvation in this Ideal Woman. Claudia concludes that the protagonist is unsympathetic because he is incapable of love. Broken, Guido calls off the film, but the producer and the film's staff announce a press conference. Guido attempts to escape from the journalists and eventually imagines shooting himself in the head. Guido realizes he was attempting to solve his personal confusion by creating a film to help others, when instead he needs to accept his life for what it is. He asks Luisa for her assistance in doing so. Carla tells him that she figured out what he was trying to say: that Guido can't do without the people in his life. The men and women hold hands and run around the circle, Guido and Luisa joining them last.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Guido Anselmi, a film director\n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Claudia, a film star Guido casts as his Ideal Woman\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Luisa Anselmi, Guido's estranged wife\n* [[Sandra Milo]] as Carla, Guido's mistress\n* [[Rossella Falk]] as Rossella, Luisa's best friend and Guido's confidante\n* [[Barbara Steele]] as Gloria Morin, Mezzabotta's new young girlfriend\n* [[Madeleine Lebeau]] as Madeleine, a French actress\n* [[Caterina Boratto]] as a mysterious lady in the hotel\n* [[Eddra Gale]] as La Saraghina, a prostitute\n* [[Guido Alberti]] as Pace, a film producer\n* [[Giuditta Rissone]] as Guido's mother\n* [[Annibale Ninchi]] as Guido's father\n* {{ill|Mario Conocchia|it|Mario Conocchia}} as a fictionalized version of himself, Guido's production assistant\n* Bruno Agostini as a fictionalized version of himself, the production director\n* Cesarino Miceli Picardi as a fictionalized version of himself, the production supervisor\n* {{ill|Jean Rougeul|fr|}} as Carini Daumier, a film critic\n* [[Mario Pisu]] as Mario Mezzabotta, Guido's friend\n* Yvonne Casadei as Jacqueline Bonbon, a former cabaret dancer\n* Mary Indovino as Maya, the clairvoyant\n* [[Abdalqadir as-Sufi|Ian Dallas]] as Maurice, Maya's assistant\n* [[Mino Doro]] as Alberto, Claudia's agent\n* Nadia Sanders as Nadine\n* [[Olimpia Cavalli]] as Olimpia\n* [[Eugene Walter]] as an American journalist\n* [[Edy Vessel]] as a mannequin\n* Simonetta Simeoni as young girl\n* [[Ferdinand Guillaume]] as the clown\n* [[Maria Antonietta Beluzzi]] as a prostitute\n}}\n\n== Themes ==\n''{{frac|8|1|2}}'' is about the struggles involved in the creative process, both technical and personal, and the problems artists face when expected to deliver something personal and profound with intense public scrutiny, on a constricted schedule, while simultaneously having to deal with their own personal relationships. It is, in a larger sense, about finding true personal happiness within a difficult, fragmented life. Like several Italian films of the period (most evident in the films of Fellini's contemporary, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]), ''{{frac|8|1|2}}'' also is about the alienating effects of [[Modernization theory|modernization]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Screening the Past|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/reviews/rev0703/gmolbr15.html|access-date=9 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915134131/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/reviews/rev0703/gmolbr15.html|archive-date=15 September 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe title is in keeping with Fellini's self-reflexive theme: the making of his eighth-and-a-half film.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 175</ref> His previous six feature films included ''[[The White Sheik|Lo sceicco bianco]]'' (1952), ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953), ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), ''[[Il bidone]]'' (1955), ''[[Nights of Cabiria|Le notti di Cabiria]]'' (1957), and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960). With [[Alberto Lattuada]], he co-directed ''[[Variety Lights|Luci del variet\u00e0]]'' (''Variety Lights'') (1950). His two short segments included ''Un'Agenzia Matrimoniale'' (''A Marriage Agency'') in the [[Anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Love in the City (1953 film)|L'amore in citt\u00e0]]'' (''Love in the City'') (1953) and ''Le Tentazioni del Dottor Antonio'' from the omnibus film ''[[Boccaccio '70]]'' (1962). The working title for ''{{frac|8|1|2}}'' was ''La bella confusione'' (''The Beautiful Confusion'') proposed by co-screenwriter, [[Ennio Flaiano]], but Fellini then \"had the simpler idea (which proved entirely wrong) to call it ''Comedy''\".<ref>Quoted in Kezich, 234</ref>\n\nAccording to Italian writer [[Alberto Arbasino]], Fellini's film used similar artistic procedures and had parallels with Musil's novel ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' (1930).<ref>Gabriele Pedull\u00e0, [[Alberto Arbasino]] [2000] [http://www.libraweb.net/articoli3.php?chiave=543&rivista=23&articolo=200302301011 \"Interviste&nbsp;\u2013Sull'albero di ciliegie\" (\"On the Cherry Tree\")] in ''CONTEMPORANEA Rivista di studi sulla letteratura e sulla comunicazione'', Volume 1, 2003. Q: In some of your texts written during the 60{{snd}}I'm thinking above all of ''Certi romanzi''{{snd}}critical reflections on questions of the novel [...] are always interlaced in both an implicit and explicit way with reflections on cinema. In particular, it seems to me that your affinity with Fellini is especially significant: for example, your review of ''Otto e mezzo'' in ''Il Giorno''. A: Reading Musil, we discovered parallels and similar procedures. But without being able to establish, either then or today, how much there was of Flaiano and how much, on the other hand, was of [Fellini's] own intuition.</ref>\n\nThe film is unusual in that it is a film about making a film, and the film that is being made is the film that the audience is viewing. An example is the dream sequence of \"Guido's Harem\" where Guido is bathed and carried in white linen by all the women from the film, only to have the women protest for being sent to live upstairs in the house when they turn 30, and \"Jacquilene Bonbon\" does her last dance.  The Guido's Harem scene is immediately followed by the \"Screen Test\" depicting the same actors in a theater, each taking the stage for a screen test, being chosen to act for the very scene the audience just watched. This mirror of mirrors, is further emphasized at the end where the director Guido sits at the table of the press conference, where the entire table is a mirror reflecting the director in it.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Marcello Mastroianni in 8\u00bd.jpg|thumb|[[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Guido Anselmi]]\nIn an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering from a creative block: \"Well then\u2014a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It's a warning bell: something is blocking up his system.\"<ref>Affron, 227</ref> Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist's profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy \"looking for the film\"<ref>Alpert, 159</ref> in the hope of resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested ''La bella confusione'' (literally ''The Beautiful Confusion'') as the film's title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on ''{{frac|8|1|2}}'', a [[Self-reference|self-referential]] title referring principally (but not exclusively)<ref>Kezich, 234 and Affron, 3-4</ref> to the number of films he had directed up to that time.\n\nGiving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], and [[Sandra Milo]] in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired [[cinematographer]] [[Gianni Di Venanzo]], among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living.<ref>Alpert, 160</ref> The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecitt\u00e0 office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had \"lost his film\" and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of ''{{frac|8|1|2}}'', Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he \"felt overwhelmed by shame\u2026 I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight to the heart of the film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make\".<ref>Fellini, ''Comments on Film'', 161-62</ref>\n\nWhen shooting began on 9 May 1962, [[Eugene Walter]] recalled Fellini taking \"a little piece of brown paper tape\" and sticking it near the [[viewfinder]] of the [[Movie camera|camera]]. Written on it was ''Ricordati che \u00e8 un film comico'' (\"Remember that this is a comic film\").<ref>Eugene Walter, \"Dinner with Fellini\", ''The Transatlantic Review'', Autumn 1964. Quoted in Affron, 267</ref> Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director's American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale. Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels \"on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional - the realm of fantasy\".<ref>Alpert, 170</ref>\n\n''{{frac|8|1|2}}'' was filmed in the spherical cinematographic process, using 35-millimeter film, and exhibited with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.85:1. As with most Italian films of this period, the sound was entirely dubbed in afterwards; following a technique dear to Fellini, many lines of the dialogue were written only during post production, while the actors on the set mouthed random lines. ''Otto e mezzo'' marks the first time that actress [[Claudia Cardinale]] was allowed to dub her own dialogue; previously her voice was thought to be too throaty and, coupled with her [[Tunisia]]n accent, was considered undesirable.<ref>''{{frac|8|1|2}}'', Criterion Collection DVD, featured commentary track.</ref> This is Fellini's last black-and-white film.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Newton |first1=Michael |title=Fellini's 8\u00bd \u2013 a masterpiece by cinema's ultimate dreamer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/fellinis-eight-and-a-half-masterpiece-cinemas-dreamer |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1962, Fellini shot the end of the film as initially written: Guido and his wife sit together in the restaurant car of a train bound for [[Rome]]. Lost in thought, Guido looks up to see all the characters of his film smiling ambiguously at him as the train enters a tunnel. Fellini then shot an alternative ending set around the spaceship on the beach at dusk but with the intention of using the scenes as a trailer for promotional purposes only. In the documentary ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'', co-scriptwriter [[Tullio Pinelli]] explains how he warned Fellini to abandon the train sequence with its implicit theme of [[suicide]] for an upbeat ending.<ref>\"The suicide theme is so overwhelming,\" Pinelli told Fellini, \"that you'll crush your film.\" Cited in ''Fellini: I'm a Born Liar'' (2002), directed by [[Damian Pettigrew]].</ref> Fellini accepted the advice, using the alternative beach sequence as a more harmonious and exuberant finale.<ref>Alpert, 174-175, and Kezich, 245. The documentary ''L'Ultima sequenza'' (2003) also discusses the lost sequence.</ref>\n\nAfter shooting wrapped on 14 October, [[Nino Rota]] composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro's cinema.<ref name=\"Kezich, 245\">Kezich, 245</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.!!Title!!Composer\n|-\n|1.|| '''La Passerella di Otto e Mezzo'''||[[Nino Rota]]\n|-\n|2a.||'''Cimitero'''||Nino Rota\n|-\n|2b.||'''Gigolette'''||[[Franz Leh\u00e1r]]\n|-\n|2c.||'''Cadillac''' / '''Carlotta's Galop'''||Nino Rota\n|-\n|3.||'''E Poi (Walzer)'''||Nino Rota\n|-\n|4.|| '''L'Illusionista'''||Nino Rota\n|-\n|5.|| '''Concertino Alle Terme||[[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Piotr I.

He's afraid of life and wants to return to his mother's womb ... In some respects, he resembles [[Leopold Bloom]], the hero of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', and we have the impression that Fellini has read and contemplated this book. The film is introverted, a sort of private monologue interspersed with glimpses of reality&nbsp;.... Fellini's dreams are always surprising and, in a figurative sense, original, but his memories are pervaded by a deeper, more delicate sentiment. This is why the two episodes concerning the hero's childhood at the old country house in [[Romagna]] and his meeting with the woman on the beach in [[Rimini]] are the best of the film, and among the best of all Fellini's works to date\".<ref>Moravia's review first published in ''L'Espresso'' (Rome) on 17 February 1963. Quoted in Fava and Vigano, 115\u2013116</ref>\n\nReviewing for ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', Giovanni Grazzini underlined that \"the beauty of the film lies in its 'confusion'... a mixture of error and truth, reality and dream, stylistic and human values, and in the complete harmony between Fellini's cinematographic language and Guido's rambling imagination. It is impossible to distinguish Fellini from his fictional director and so Fellini's faults coincide with Guido's spiritual doubts. The [[osmosis]] between art and life is amazing. It will be difficult to repeat this achievement.<ref>Grazzini's review first published in ''Corriere della Sera'' (Milan) on 16 February 1963. Quoted in Fava and Vigano, 116</ref> Fellini's genius shines in everything here, as it has rarely shone in the movies. There isn't a set, a character or a situation that doesn't have a precise meaning on the great stage that is ''{{frac|8|1|2}}''\".<ref>This translation of Grazzini's review quoted in Affron, 255</ref> Mario Verdone of ''Bianco e Nero'' insisted the film was \"like a brilliant improvisation&nbsp;... The film became the most difficult feat the director ever tried to pull off. It is like a series of acrobats [sic] that a tightrope walker tries to execute high above the crowd,&nbsp;... always on the verge of falling and being smashed on the ground. But at just the right moment, the acrobat knows how to perform the right somersault: with a push he straightens up, saves himself and wins\".<ref>Affron, 255</ref>\n\n''{{frac|8|1|2}}'' screened at the [[1963 Cannes Film Festival]] in April to \"almost universal acclaim\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 180\">Alpert, 180</ref> and was Italy's official entry in the later [[3rd Moscow International Film Festival]] where it won the Grand Prize. French film director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] wrote: \"Fellini's film is complete, simple, beautiful, honest, like the one Guido wants to make in ''{{frac|8|1|2}}''\".<ref>Truffaut's review first published in ''Lui'' (Paris), 1 July 1963. Affron, 257</ref> ''Premier Plan'' critics Andr\u00e9 Bouissy and Raymond Borde argued that the film \"has the importance, magnitude, and technical mastery of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. It has aged twenty years of the avant-garde in one fell swoop because it both integrates and surpasses all the discoveries of experimental cinema\".<ref>First published in ''Premier Plan'' (Paris), 30 November 1963. Affron, 257</ref> Pierre Kast of ''Les [[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'' explained that \"my admiration for Fellini is not without limits. For instance, I did not enjoy ''[[La Strada]]'' but I did ''[[I Vitelloni]]''. But I think we must all admit that ''{{frac|8|1|2}}'', leaving aside for the moment all prejudice and reserve, is prodigious. Fantastic liberality, a total absence of precaution and hypocrisy, absolute dispassionate sincerity, artistic and financial courage these are the characteristics of this incredible undertaking\".<ref>First published in ''Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma'' (Paris), July 1963.
