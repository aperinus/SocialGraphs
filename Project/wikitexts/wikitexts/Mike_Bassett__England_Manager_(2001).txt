However, the [[kickstarter]] project that was essential for raising funds for the film did not meet its target.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/18/mike-bassett-interim-manager-least-essential-sequel|title=Mike Bassett: Interim Manager \u2013 is this the least essential sequel ever?|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nWith the film narrated by [[Martin Bashir]] in a documentary form, we are told that [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] manager Mike Bassett ([[Ricky Tomlinson]]) is victorious as his side win the Mr Clutch Cup at [[Wembley Stadium]]. The team later take part in an open-top bus parade but the driver accidentally takes them the wrong way and they end up going down a [[motorway]] leaving the entire team windswept before returning to the city centre to finish the parade. Away from Norwich, it is reported in the papers that [[England national football team|England]] manager Phil Cope has suffered a heart attack during qualification for the [[World Cup]], which started out well but has since gone badly wrong.\n\nThe heads of the [[Football Association]] meet to decide who should be the new England manager. After phoning around [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] they conclude that nobody wants the job and are forced to look for a new coach in England but cannot decide on who should take the role. The most successful [[Premier League]] manager is Scottish (based on [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]), while the second-most successful is a former England captain who is interested in the job, but the FA decide that he is too much of a \"loudmouth\" and refuse to consider him (a reference to the numerous times [[Brian Clough]] was passed over for the England job). None of the other English managers in the Premier League are interested, forcing the FA to look to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] for a new manager, with the press speculating that Mike Bassett may be the new man for the job. Mike lives at home with his wife Karine and son, Jason. He is described as a former professional footballer who played for [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].\n\nWhen the press turn up at Mike's house to question him about the job he initially denies the speculation until his son Jason appears with a phone to tell him he's got the job. Bassett takes over the England team and moves to appoint his coaching staff, namely assistant manager turned car salesman Lonnie Urquart ([[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]]) who is not interested unless Mike buys a car from him, and coach Dave Dodds ([[Bradley Walsh]]) who is a sycophantic [[Sycophant|yes man]] who once managed with Mike at [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] (a reference to [[Phil Neal]] under the [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] era). The team need one win from three World Cup qualifiers to get to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Finals]] in [[Brazil]]. Bassett travels north to meet Kevin Tonkinson ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]), who he believes will win England the world cup, but on arrival at the pub he finds Tonkinson laying drunk on a pool table with people pouring beer into his mouth. Once calmed down, Bassett tells him to clean up his act and if he can promise to do it then he will recall him to the squad.\n\nBassett takes his first training session at [[Bisham Abbey]] ahead of his first game at [[Wembley Stadium]] against [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. He selects an old-fashioned 4-4-2 formation and writes his team sheets on the back of an old [[cigarette]] packet. During the game, Tonkinson opens the scoring with a dink shot over the keeper, but Poland soon begin to put pressure on and eventually equalise before going on to win the game 2\u20131. Bassett is criticised by the media for the formation he played and the tactics used. Meanwhile, some of his players anonymously state to an interviewer that they have doubts about Bassett's credibility to lead the team. Bassett sits his coaching staff down to review the game but Doddsy's wife has taped ''[[Ground Force]]'' over the recording. In an attempt to improve the team's mental and psychological wellbeing, they visit a sports science institute but half the team are injured in the process, leaving Bassett with selection issues over his next game against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. In a mix-up, his secretary accidentally calls up to the squad two players called Benson and Hedges, aging players who are playing in the [[EFL League Two|Third Division]]. When querying who they are, Mike realises she has mistaken the brand of cigarettes [[Benson and Hedges]] as the names of players. Bassett is mocked in a press conference but claims he called them up intentionally. England lose the game 3\u20130, leading to pressure being placed on his family by angry supporters.\n\nFor the last qualification game, England need to beat [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] in order to qualify and with Tonkinson missing due to a drunken car crash, they struggle to a 0\u20130 draw in which captain Gary Wackett ([[Geoffrey Bell|Geoff Bell]]) is sent off and Rufus Smalls ([[Robbie Gee]]) misses a penalty. After the game, they learn that [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] have beaten [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] 2-0 which sees them go through on goal difference. The team head off to record the official England World Cup song with girl group [[Atomic Kitten]] and \"hellraiser\" [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]].\n\nEngland travel to [[Brazil]] for the finals but on arriving at the airport they start brawling with the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish]] teams. A difficult group stage sees them on the verge of heading home after they can only manage a goalless draw with unfancied [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] before losing 4\u20130 to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. To make matters worse, Bassett receives a phone call from Karine at home in England, informing him that Jason was bullied at school for the Egypt draw, resulting in his eyebrows being shaved off. One of England's training sessions is ruined after Urquart locks the footballs in his [[Opel]] and goes shopping. Wackett is then sent home for taking part in hooliganism and Tonkinson accidentally gets involved in a drunken tryst with a transsexual and is also booted from the team. During a team meeting the next morning, Urquart begins to praise the Mexicans by getting the English players to cheer \"three cheers for Ramirez\"; this angers Mike, who proclaims \"We're England\", saying that the country hates him and that his wife is about to leave him. Urquart, unhappy with Mike's tone, asks him to get more off his chest, which leads to Mike calling him a small-minded bigot and criticising the car he bought from him. Urquart reacts by punching him in the nose and is effectively sacked from the team instantly. Later that night, Tonkinson is reconciled with Bassett and the two share a drink, which leads to them dancing drunkenly on a bar top. When Lightfoot gets on the bar to coerce Mike down, the pair both fall off in full view of the local press.\n\nThe morning after his drunken incident, Bassett is involved in a press conference at which he is expected to step down from the managerial position. When he announces that he is carrying on, the press begin to get hostile and Bassett responds by reciting of \"[[If\u2014]]\" by [[Rudyard Kipling]], which he finishes by saying that \"England will be playing [[4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u2013fucking\u20132]]\" and storms out. Following this, England need to beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] to get through to the second round. Reporter Tommo ([[Phill Jupitus]]) proclaims that if England win he will quit his job and become a bin man. In a close game in which England are the better team, they eventually succeed when Tonkinson dribbles past the Argentinian defence and blasts a shot that deflects off the crossbar. Tonkinson then punches the ball into the net \u2013 a reference to [[the hand of God]] goal from Argentina's [[Diego Maradona]] which helped to knock England out of the [[1986 World Cup]]. As the full-time whistle sounds and the England team celebrate, Bassett heads down the tunnel telling Doddsy he's going to call his wife.\n\nIt is later seen in a series of newspaper articles that England advanced to the knock-out stages, where they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[France national football team|France]], with Rufus Smalls breaking his goal drought and scoring a hat-trick against Romania to become England's top goalscorer, with 52 international goals. They eventually lost to host nation Brazil in the semi-finals. Tommo Thompson is also seen briefly working as a binman following his statement during the final press conference. On their plane journey back to Britain, Bashir says to Bassett that England had equalled their best performance since they won in 1966 (in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]], England finished fourth). Bassett replies that he is ready to move aside and let somebody else take the job. As the plane doors open at the airport, the team depart to a cheering crowd, where a surprised but happy Bassett confirms to the waiting press that he will remain as manager.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Ricky Tomlinson]] as Mike Bassett, a former player turned manager from the [[English Football League|lower leagues]] who leads [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] to the Mr. Clutch Cup.

Bassett subsequently guided [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to two consecutive relegations, before unsuccessful returns to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]] and [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]] lead to him taking over at his father's former club, Wirral County.\n\n==Alternative ending==\nAn alternative ending was shot for the film, in which Mike rejects a four-year extension to stay on as manager with England choosing to appoint a foreign manager as his replacement. Gary Wackett has now retired and is now on television as a [[Gladiators (1992 British TV series)|Gladiator]], whilst Rufus Smalls is given his captaincy back on [[BBC]]'s ''[[A Question of Sport]]''. Kevin Tonkinson has also retired and now is the manager of his local pub where as Mike is seen coaching players on a sandy field and is now the new manager of [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]]. The film ends with Mike jumping on board a red jeep and driving off with Karine and Jason.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjKzbo8zb3M|title = Mike Bassett - England Manager (Alternate Ending)|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n== Sequel ==\nFollowing the success of the film, numerous talks over the years about a possible sequel. In late 2004 it announced that Mike Bassett 2 was in the works, with the story being continued on from the first movie which sees this time Bassett leading his country to the European Championships in [[Portugal]] in 2004. This project was later abandoned and instead the producers reverted to the idea of a television series for ITV ''[[Mike Bassett: Manager]]''.\n\nIn 2016 a Kick Starter campaign was started, which saw both [[Ricky Tomlinson]] and [[Bradley Walsh]] reprise their roles for a promotional trailer, asking fans to fund to a sequel called ''Mike Bassett: Interim Manager''. The movie needed to hit a certain financial target by a specific date in order for it to be made. The campaign did not hit its target and the project was shelved. It was understood the script centred round Bassett coming out of retirement in order to help assist the current England manager, who is German and\nstruggling to engage his players. Before too long Bassett finds himself back in the hotseat and possibly leading his country to another World Cup.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe movie received a mixed reception from critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/56-Films/3057-how-it-wasnt|title=How it wasn't|first=David|last=Stubbs|website=When Saturday Comes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=7282 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021125919/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=7282 |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 October 2012 |title=Empire's Mike Bassett: England Manager Movie Review |work=Empire Online|date=5 December 2006|access-date=5 July 2012|publisher=Bauer Media Group}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/28/culture.peterbradshaw2|work=The Guardian|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw| title=Mike Bassett: England Manager|date=28 September 2001}}</ref><ref name=BBCRev/><ref name=VarRev/> When the film was released in the [[United Kingdom]], it originally opened at number 3, behind ''[[Artificial Intelligence: AI]]'' and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' in the top two spots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20010928|title=Historical UK Weekend Box Office - 28th September 2001 - 30th September 2001|work=25th Frame|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince its release, ''Mike Bassett: England Manager'' has gained popularity as a [[cult film]] among English football fans.<ref name=\"Fennessy\"/> Rugby coach [[Brendan Venter]] gave a press interview in 2010 that parodied one given by \"Doddsie\" in the film, in which he simply agrees with everything the questioner says, even if that contradicts previous answers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/brendan-venter-in-mike-bassett-england-269210|title=Brendan Venter in Mike Bassett: England Manager-style TV outburst|first=Alex|last=Spink|date=13 December 2010|work=Mirror Online|access-date=18 May 2020|publisher=MGN}}</ref>\n\nSprackling observed in 2018 that \"when the film actually came out in 2001, [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] was in charge and he was at the height of his pomp.
