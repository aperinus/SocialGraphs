The film stars [[Robin Tunney]], [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Neve Campbell]], and [[Rachel True]]. It follows four outcast teenage girls at a [[Los Angeles]] [[Parochial school|parochial high school]] who pursue [[witchcraft]] for their own gain and subsequently experience negative repercussions.\n\n''The Craft'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 3, 1996, by [[Columbia Pictures]].

A\u00a0sequel, ''[[The Craft: Legacy]]'', was released on October 28, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nSarah Bailey, a beautiful but troubled teenage girl with unusual abilities, has just moved from [[San Francisco]] to [[Los Angeles]] with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls who are outcasts for various reasons and are rumored to be [[Witchcraft|witches]]. Bonnie Harper bears burn scars from an auto accident, Nancy Downs lives in a trailer with her mother and abusive stepfather, and Rochelle Zimmerman is a black student who is subjected to racist bullying by a group of popular white girls. The girls worship a powerful deity they call \"Manon\".\n\nSarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris Hooker. When Bonnie observes Sarah levitating a pencil in class, she and the other outcast girls are convinced that she can complete their coven as \"the fourth\", completing a wind-water-earth-fire circle and making them all powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car. The girls believe their combined will caused it to happen, which strengthens their bond. It is also revealed that Sarah once attempted suicide.\n\nAfter a date with Chris, Sarah is upset that he spread a false rumor that they had sex and she was terrible in bed. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell on him. Rochelle then casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie. Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy a spell for power. The spells are successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, Bonnie's scars on her back miraculously heal. Rochelle's bully, Laura, begins losing her hair. Nancy causes her stepfather to have a fatal heart attack, probably using pleurisy root as foreshadowed by open book in previous scene, enabling her and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move into a luxurious high-rise apartment.\n\nNancy becomes power hungry and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit,\" despite being warned against the spell by Lirio, the owner of a local occult shop and practicing witch. Upon completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning. The following morning, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, with beached [[shark]]s and other dead animals littering the shore. In the days that follow, Nancy becomes increasingly devoid of empathy and engages in risky behavior that endangers her life and those of others.\n\nThe spells the girls cast eventually lead to negative consequences, as Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatized by her baldness and sobbing hysterically, and the obsessed Chris attempts to rape Sarah after she rejects his continual advances. In supposed retaliation, Nancy uses a glamour spell to make herself look like Sarah and attempts to fool Chris into having sex with her at a party. She is interrupted by the real Sarah, who tells Nancy to leave with her, but it becomes obvious that Nancy's desire to control Chris is mixed with unrequited feelings. Upset at being fooled, Chris says Nancy must be jealous, angering her, and she uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window.\n\nSarah attempts a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, but it does not work and the coven turns on Sarah. Sarah seeks out Lirio, but changes her mind and leaves before Lirio can offer help. They invade her dreams, torment her with visions of swarms of [[snake]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[insect]]s, and make her believe that her family has died in a plane crash.  The rest of the coven then try to induce Sarah to commit suicide, and Nancy cuts Sarah's wrists herself. Although initially terrified, Sarah successfully invokes the spirit and is able to heal herself and fight back. She scares off Bonnie and Rochelle by showing them glamours in a mirror of Bonnie with her face scarred and Rochelle losing her hair like Laura. Sarah then defeats Nancy and binds her, preventing her from causing harm forever.\n\nBonnie and Rochelle, finding their powers gone, visit Sarah to attempt reconciliation, only to find that she wants nothing to do with them and that Manon took their powers because they abused them. They scornfully mutter that Sarah must have lost her powers too but Sarah then makes a tree branch nearly fall on them. She warns them to be careful not to end up like Nancy, who has been committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]], delusional and stripped of her powers, and strapped to her bed as she desperately insists she can fly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Sarah Bailey\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Nancy Downs \n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Bonnie Harper \n* [[Rachel True]] as Rochelle Zimmerman\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Chris Hooker\n* [[Cliff DeYoung]] as Mr. Bailey\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Laura Lizzie\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Mitt\n* [[Nathaniel Marston]] as Trey\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Grace Downs\n* [[Assumpta Serna]] as Lirio\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Street Preacher\n* [[Brenda Strong]] as Doctor\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept for ''The Craft'' came from a collaboration between producer [[Douglas Wick]], who wanted to create a film about the high school experience blended with witchcraft, and screenwriter Peter Filardi, who extensively researched the topic and wrote the initial draft.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> [[Andrew Fleming]] was hired to direct and produce the final version of the screenplay.\n\nEighty-five other actresses screen-tested for the four main roles, including [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]].<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> [[Rachel True]] and [[Fairuza Balk]] were the first to be cast in their respective roles. The character of Rochelle was re-written to be black when True was cast, incorporating racism [[subplot]] as the character's major conflict. [[Robin Tunney]] was initially cast in the role of Bonnie, but the producers decided she would be better in the starring role of Sarah, which she was persuaded to accept despite preferring the former. [[Neve Campbell]], the most well known of the four actresses for her role on ''[[Party of Five]]'', was then cast as Bonnie. Tunney had shaved her head for her role in ''[[Empire Records]]'' and had to wear a wig throughout filming.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/>\n\nProduction enlisted a real-life Wiccan named Pat Devin to act as an on-set advisor for the film. She wrote the incantations used and ensured that the treatment of the [[Wicca]]n subject-matter was as accurate and respectful as possible.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/>\n\nThe shooting took place throughout Los Angeles, including the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], [[Sunset Boulevard]], and [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]]. [[Verdugo Hills High School]] was the setting for the fictional Catholic school, St. Benedict's Academy; production designer Marek Dobrowolski added different religious statues throughout the building and the grounds. Sarah's home in the film was a two-story Spanish mansion and the interiors were built on a soundstage at Culver City Studios. The occult bookstore was shot at the El Adobe Marketplace in [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The room was repainted and enhanced and occult icons such as candles, stigmas, religious statues, masks, and tribal dolls were added for effect. Jensen's Recreation Center in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] was chosen to avoid overuse of frequently seen Los Angeles locations. During filming, an unrelated accident occurred in which a child was injured; the production's medic saw this and called paramedics. The makeshift altar was set in Wood Ranch, a location that Dobrowolski called the hardest to find. Dobrowolski wanted to avoid manicured parks like [[Griffith Park]]. The beach summoning took place at [[Leo Carrillo State Park]], which was chosen because its crest made it seem less visually boring.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowan |first=Jared |date=May 2, 2016 |title=Revisiting the L.A.

The soundtrack contains a collection of songs, to suit the theme of the movie, from various artists including [[Heather Nova]], [[Letters to Cleo]], and [[Spacehog]]. Nova's version of \"[[I Have the Touch]]\", originally performed by [[Peter Gabriel]], which featured during the end credits of the film, was exclusively included on the soundtrack, and is not available as a single, or on any of Nova's albums, nor does she perform the song in concert. The tracks in film, titled \"Sick Child\", \"[[Fallin' (Connie Francis song)|Fallin']]\" and \"Scorn\", performed by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Connie Francis]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], respectively, were omitted from the soundtrack due to copyright issues from their record labels. However, they were only included in the film as part of an arrangement with [[PolyGram|PolyGram Film & Television Licensing]]. An uncredited bonus track, \"Bells, Books, and Candles\", composed by [[Graeme Revell]] for the film's score, was included on the soundtrack. A follow-up soundtrack, ''The Original Motion Picture Score'', was released on June 18, 1996 from [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and contained the film's score which was entirely composed and produced by Graeme Revell.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1437122/a/craft.htm| title=''Craft'' Soundtrack CD| publisher=[[CD Universe]]| access-date=February 21, 2017| archive-date=August 19, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819003727/http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1437122/a/craft.htm| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n| title1          = [[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\n| extra1          = [[Our Lady Peace]]\n| writer1         = [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]]\n| length1         = 4:14\n| title2          = [[I Have the Touch]] \n| extra2          = [[Heather Nova]]\n| writer2         = [[Peter Gabriel]]\n| length2         = 4:17\n| title3          = All This and Nothing\n| extra3          = [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]]\n| writer3         = [[Vinnie Dombroski]]\n| length3         = 4:19\n| title4          = [[Dangerous Type]]\n| extra4          = [[Letters to Cleo]]\n| writer4         = [[Ric Ocasek]]\n| length4         = 3:39\n| title5          = [[How Soon Is Now?#Love Spit Love|How Soon Is Now?]]\n| extra5          = [[Love Spit Love]]\n| writer5         = [[Morrissey|Steven Morrissey]], [[Johnny Marr|John Marr]]\n| length5         = 4:25\n| title6          = Dark Secret\n| extra6          = [[Matthew Sweet]]\n| writer6         = Matthew Sweet\n| length6         = 4:04\n| title7          = Witches Song\n| extra7          = [[Juliana Hatfield]]\n| writer7         = {{hlist|[[Marianne Faithfull]]|Joe Mavety|[[Barry Reynolds]]|[[Terry Stannard]]|Steve York}}\n| length7         = 4:35\n| title8          = Jump Into the Fire\n| extra8          = [[Tripping Daisy]]\n| writer8         = [[Harry Nilsson]]\n| length8         = 5:45\n| title9          = Under the Water\n| extra9          = [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]\n| writer9         = [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel Kilcher]], [[Ralph Sall]]\n| length9         = 4:58\n| title10         = Warning\n| extra10         = [[All Too Much]]\n| writer10        = [[Tim DeLaughter]], Ralph Sall\n| length10        = 4:44\n| title11         = Spastica\n| extra11         = [[Elastica]]\n| writer11        = [[Justine Frischmann]]\n| length11        = 2:31\n| title12         = The Horror\n| extra12         = [[Spacehog]]\n| writer12        = [[Bryce Goggin]]\n| length12        = 4:49\n| title13         = Bells, Books and Candles \n| extra13         = [[Graeme Revell]]\n| writer13        = Revell\n| length13        = 4:47\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Craft'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 3, 1996, by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n===Home Media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on July 22, 1997 and rereleased on a special edition [[DVD]] on September 12, 2000.
