She lives in a [[Tama New Town|Tokyo suburb]] with her parents Asako, Seiya and older sister Shiho, and is keen on reading books, particularly fairy tales. One summer evening, she looks through the checkout cards in her library books and discovers they were all checked out previously by someone named Seiji Amasawa.\n\nShizuku meets Y\u016bko at the school and reveals \"Concrete Roads,\" her \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" parody written for the school graduation and criticizing the deforestation of [[Tama New Town]]. Y\u016bko reveals that she has a crush on a boy named Sugimura, who happens to be Shizuku's friend. Y\u016bko and Shizuku walk home when she realizes she left her book at the school. She runs back to discover a boy reading her book which he returns, but not without teasing her and slighting her lyrics, which leaves her feeling irritable for the rest of the evening. On the next day, while on her way to the library to deliver her father's lunch to him, Shizuku encounters a peculiar cat commuting on the train, and follows it to discover an [[antique shop]] run by Shir\u014d Nishi. In the shop there is a cat statuette nicknamed The Baron as well as a centuries old [[Clock|antique clock]]. Realizing she's late for the library, Shizuku runs out feeling ecstatic about finding \"a place where stories begin\", only to run into the boy she had met the previous day, who returns the lunchbox she left behind. He comments on how much food is in the box and rides away, singing her song, leaving Shizuku in another foul mood.\n\nWhen school restarts, Y\u016bko is devastated when Sugimura asks her to reply to a love letter his teammate sent. Shizuku confronts Sugimura and scolds him for his actions, only for him to reveal he had a crush on her. However, she rejects him in order to not hurt Y\u016bko. Shizuku leaves feeling leveled. Feeling disconsolate, Shizuku decides to head to the antique shop, meeting the boy once more. He shows her the workshop, where she discovers that he is learning to make violins to pursue his dream of becoming a master [[luthier]]. She begs him to play the violin for her, but he agrees on the condition that she sings along. The pair perform \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" as it was adapted by Shizuku for her graduation. The boy is revealed to be Seiji, Nishi's grandson, and Shizuku and Seiji finally befriend each other.\n\nSeiji admits that he admires Shizuku\u2019s talents, and reveals his dream to become a [[luthier]], as well as his efforts of checking out a large number of books in the hopes that she would eventually notice him. Days after, Seiji leaves for [[Cremona|Cremona, Italy]] for a two-month study with a master violin-maker. Inspired by Seiji, Shizuku decides to pursue her skill for writing seriously in the same two months. She asks Nishi if she can write a story featuring the Baron, to which Nishi grants his consent in exchange for being the first to read her story.\n\nShizuku concocts a fantasy story called \"Whisper of the Heart\", featuring herself as the protagonist, the Baron as the male hero looking for his lost love, Louise, and the cat from the train (a neighborhood stray who is, among other names, known as \"Moon\" and \"Muta\") as the antagonist. Devoting her time to her writing, Shizuku stays up until early in the morning, and her school grades drop. She argues with Shiho over her grades and future, but their parents tell Shizuku to continue her dream but that the path will be difficult. As she continues to push herself and Shiho tells her that she is moving out, her anxiety mounts.\n\nWhen her story is complete, Nishi reads it and gives his honest assessment, which is that Shizuku is talented, but requires refinement through practice. Shizuku bursts into tears as the stress of the last two months turns into relief. Nishi consoles her and tells her the real-life story of the Baron. When he studied in Germany in his youth, he found his first love, a woman named Louise. Nishi discovered the twin statuettes of the Baron and his female companion in a cafe, but as the female one was away for repairs, the shopkeeper would only allow Nishi to buy the Baron if Louise agreed to hold onto its companion so they could be reunited. However, the two lovers and their cat statues were separated during [[World War II]], and could not find each other after the war ended. Nishi then thanks Shizuku for bringing life to what used to be just a memory for him. In the original Japanese script, Shizuku never knew of the truth of the Baron's origin or of Louise, and Seiji earlier tells her that his grandfather refuses to speak of it. This makes Shizuku's inclusion of Louise in the story a tremendous coincidence, or something else. In the English dub, Seiji's dialogue is changed and he briefly tells her about Louise.\n\nDeciding she needs to learn more about writing, and that she wants to attend high school, Shizuku announces to her mother that she will resume studying for her high school entrance exams. Shizuku wakes up early in the morning and sees Seiji outside on his bicycle, having returned a day earlier. In the English dub, Seiji tells Shizuku he decided to finish high school before returning to Cremona to become a luthier, differing from the Japanese dialogue, in which he says he will return to Cremona after junior high school graduation as planned.\n\nSeiji takes Shizuku on his bike to his hidden lookout, where they watch the sunrise. Seiji professes his love for Shizuku and proposes that they marry in the future; she happily accepts.\n\nShizuku's \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" plays over the ending credits while daily life in her [[Tama New Town|hometown]] is observed, including Y\u016bko and Sugimura meeting up on the way home from school.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
