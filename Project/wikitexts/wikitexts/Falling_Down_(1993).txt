The film centers on Foster as he treks on foot across the city of [[Los Angeles]], trying to reach the house of his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday. Along the way, a series of encounters, both trivial and provocative, causes him to react with increasing violence and make sardonic observations on life, poverty, the economy, and commercialism. [[Robert Duvall]] co-stars as Martin Prendergast, an aging [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant on the day of his retirement, who faces his own frustrations even as he tracks down Foster.\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam Foster is stuck in traffic on a hot day. After his air conditioning fails, he abandons his car and begins walking home across Los Angeles, carrying his briefcase.\n\nAt a convenience store, the Korean owner refuses to give change for a telephone call. Foster begins ranting about the high prices. The owner grabs a baseball bat and demands Foster leave. Foster takes the bat and destroys much of the merchandise before leaving. Later, while resting on a hill, he is accosted by two gang members, who threaten him with a knife and demand his briefcase. Foster attacks them and takes their knife.\n\nThe gang members, now in a car with two friends, find Foster using a pay phone. They open fire, hitting several bystanders but not Foster. The driver crashes. Foster picks up a gun, shoots the one surviving gang member, and then leaves with their bag of weapons. Foster encounters a panhandler and gives him the briefcase, which only contains his lunch.\n\nAt a fast-food restaurant, Foster attempts to order breakfast, but they have switched to the lunch menu. After an argument with the manager, Foster pulls a gun and fires into the ceiling accidentally. After trying to reassure the frightened employees and customers, he orders lunch, but is annoyed when the burger looks nothing like the one on the menu. He leaves, tries to call from a phone booth, then shoots the booth to pieces after being hassled by someone who was waiting to use the phone. After Foster calls \"home\" again and states his intention to attend his daughter Adele's birthday party, his ex-wife Beth notifies the police because she has a restraining order.\n\nSergeant Prendergast, who is on his last day before retirement, insists on investigating. Interviews with witnesses lead Prendergast to suspect that the same person is responsible. Foster's vanity license plate proves to be an important lead, because Prendergast remembers being in the same traffic jam as Foster earlier that day. Prendergast and his partner, Detective Torres, visit Foster's mother, who is surprised to learn that Foster lost his job. They realize Foster is heading toward his former family's home in Venice, California and rush to intercept him.\n\nFoster passes a bank where a black man is protesting after being rejected for a loan. The man exchanges a glance with Foster and says, \"Don't forget me,\" as he is escorted away by police. Foster stops at a military surplus store to buy boots. The owner, a white supremacist, diverts Torres's attention when she comes in. After Torres leaves, he offers Foster a rocket launcher and congratulates him for shooting \"a bunch of niggers\" at the restaurant. When Foster expresses distaste for the store owner's racism, the man attempts to turn him over to the police, but Foster stabs him then shoots him dead. Foster changes into army clothes, takes the rocket launcher, and leaves. \n\nFoster encounters a road repair crew who are not working and accuses them of doing unnecessary repairs to justify their budget. He pulls out the rocket launcher but struggles to use it, until a boy explains how it works. Foster accidentally fires the launcher, blowing up the construction site. By the time Foster reaches Beth\u2019s house, she has already fled with Adele. He realizes that they may have gone to nearby Venice Pier, but Prendergast and Torres arrive before he can pursue them. Foster shoots Torres, injuring her, and flees with Prendergast in pursuit.\n\nAt the pier, Foster confronts his ex-wife and daughter. Adele is happy to see him, but Beth is frightened. Prendergast arrives and acknowledges Foster's complaints about being ill-treated by society, but does not accept that excuses his rampage. With Foster distracted, Beth throws his gun into the sea as Prendergast draws his revolver, insisting that Foster give himself up. With nothing left for him, Foster [[Suicide by cop|tricks Prendergast into shooting him dead]]. Having asserted himself, Prendergast decides to hold off retirement.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as William \"D-Fens\" Foster \n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Sergeant Martin Prendergast\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" Trevino\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Detective Sandra Torres\n* [[Tuesday Weld]] as Amanda Prendergast\n* [[Frederic Forrest]] as Nick\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Foster's Mother\n* Joey Hope Singer as Adele Foster-Trevino\n* [[Michael Paul Chan]] as Mr. Lee\n* [[Raymond J.

Both of these approaches represent a facile reading of the film, which is actually about a great sadness, which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant... What is fascinating about the Douglas character, as written and played, is the core of sadness in his soul. Yes, by the time we meet him, he has gone over the edge. But there is no exhilaration in his rampage, no release. He seems weary and confused, and in his actions he unconsciously follows scripts that he may have learned from the movies, or on the news, where other frustrated misfits vent their rage on innocent bystanders.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Falling Down | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/falling-down-1993 | work=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=February 26, 1993 | access-date=July 4, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' writer [[Hal Hinson]] observed:\n\n<blockquote>This guy is you, the movie suggests, and if not you exactly, then maybe the guy you're one or two bad breaks from becoming.
