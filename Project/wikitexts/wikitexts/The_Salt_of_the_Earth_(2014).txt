Salgado refers to the [[Famines in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] as a problem of distribution, not just a natural disaster. He documents the largest ever [[refugee camps]] and the innumerable deaths that occurred there, from hunger, cholera, and cold.  His work covering famine in Africa brings worldwide attention to the region and the underlying causes.\n\nAfter photographing the [[Yugoslavian war]] and Rwanda right after [[Rwandan genocide|the genocide]] to one year later, Salgado loses hope for humanity.\nGoing back to his natal [[Minas Gerais]], he founds [[Instituto Terra]] and re-forests his family land.\nThen he is inspired to photograph the wildlife.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Salt of the Earth'' received largely positive reviews from critics.
