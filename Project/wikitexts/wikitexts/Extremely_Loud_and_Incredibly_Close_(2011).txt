He is close to his father, who stimulates him with missions to hunt for clues to New York City's \"lost Sixth Borough\". The tasks he is given force him to explore his surroundings and communicate with other people, which is not easy for him.\n\nOn [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], schools close early, and Oskar arrives home alone to find six answering machine messages left by his father from the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. Oskar hides under his bed, where his grandmother finds him and stays until Linda returns home. Oskar is angry at his father's funeral, unable to make sense of his death.\n\nA year later, Oskar has a secret hiding place with memories of his father, including the answering machine and its messages. In his father's room, he accidentally shatters a vase, and inside finds a key in an envelope with the word \"Black\" on it. He becomes obsessed with finding the lock the key fits, believing it a clue from his father. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to visit each one. He lies to his mother, with whom he is becoming increasingly distant, about his outings. He first meets Abby Black, who is in the process of divorcing her husband, but she tells Oskar she did not know his father. Further encounters are fruitless, but he meets a variety of people, photographing and recording notes on each one in a scrapbook.\n\nOne day, Oskar ventures into his grandmother's apartment, but instead of finding her there, encounters the reclusive elderly renter that has been living there, whom his grandmother had warned him to avoid. The renter does not talk, communicating instead with the words \"yes\" and \"no\" tattooed on his hands and a writing pad. Oskar confides in him, and the man offers to accompany Oskar on his outings. As they explore the city together, Oskar learns to face his fears, such as those of public transport and bridges. Eventually, Oskar concludes that the stranger is his grandfather and plays the increasingly desperate answering machine recordings, but the man becomes agitated, refuses to listen to the final one, and tells Oskar to stop his search. Later, Oskar sees him arguing with his grandmother and packing to leave, and angrily confronts him as his taxi pulls away.\n\nOskar then notices a phone number for an estate sale circled on the back of a newspaper clipping of his father's. He dials the number and reaches a surprised Abby, who takes Oskar to meet her ex-husband William. William realizes Oskar's key is the one he has been looking for, left to him by his own deceased father in the vase, unbeknownst to him when he sold it to Thomas at the estate sale. Oskar confides that on the day of the attacks, he was home when the phone rang a sixth time, but was too afraid to answer. After witnessing the tower collapse on TV as the phone call cut off, he replaced the answering machine so his mother would never find out. He leaves the key with William, but runs away from Abby, distraught.\n\nBack in his room, he proceeds to destroy the material from his search, until his mother reveals to him that she had been aware of all his outings, and had gone ahead of him to meet all the Blacks to prepare them for his visit. Finally realizing how much his mother cares about him, he accepts his father's death and writes letters to all the people he met to thank them for their kindness, including his grandfather, who returns to live with his grandmother. He gives his mother his scrapbook from his adventures filled with pop-ups and pull tabs, titled \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\".\n\nSoon after, Oskar visits a spot in Central Park he and his father frequented, and looking underneath his father's favorite swing, finds a message from his father, congratulating him for finishing what would have been their final expedition, giving Oskar the closure he desperately needed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Thomas Horn as Oskar Schell\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as The Renter\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Linda Schell\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Thomas Schell\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Abby Black\n* Madison Arnold as Alan Black\n* [[John Goodman]] as Stan the Doorman\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as William Black\n* [[Zoe Caldwell]] as Oskar's grandmother\n* [[Hazelle Goodman]] as Hazelle Black\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Hector Black\n* [[Stephen Henderson (actor)|Stephen Henderson]] as Walt the Locksmith\n* [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]] as Elaine Black\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn August 2010, it was reported that director [[Stephen Daldry]] and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had been working on a film adaptation of the [[Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close|novel]] for five years.<ref name=\"DeadlineAug2010\">{{cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/warner-bros-and-paramount-in-tandem-on-extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close/ |title=Warner Bros and Paramount In Tandem On 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' |last=Fleming |first=Mike |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]] |date=August 22, 2010 |access-date=May 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905073917/http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/warner-bros-and-paramount-in-tandem-on-extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close/ |archive-date=September 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Eric Roth]] was hired to write the script.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kit |first=Borys |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stephen-daldry-direct-extremely-loud-22217 |title=Stephen Daldry to direct 'Extremely Loud': Project based on a Sept. 11-themed novel |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=October 14, 2010 |access-date=May 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021093119/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stephen-daldry-direct-extremely-loud-22217 |archive-date=October 21, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close'' is a co-production with [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]], with Warner being the \"lead studio\".<ref name=\"DeadlineAug2010\"/> [[Chris Menges]] served as [[Cinematographer|director of photography]], [[K.
