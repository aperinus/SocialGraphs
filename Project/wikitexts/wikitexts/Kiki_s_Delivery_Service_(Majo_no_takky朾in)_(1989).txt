She flies on her broomstick to the port city of Koriko. While trying to find somewhere to live, Kiki is pursued by Tombo, a geeky boy obsessed with aviation who admires her flying ability.\n\nIn exchange for accommodation, Kiki helps Osono, the kindly owner of a bakery. She opens a business delivering goods by broomstick - the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery goes badly; she is caught in wind and loses the black cat toy she is supposed to deliver. Jiji pretends to be the toy until Kiki can retrieve the real item. She finds it in the home of a young painter, Ursula, who repairs and returns it to Kiki so she can complete the delivery and rescue Jiji.\n\nKiki accepts a party invitation from Tombo, but is delayed by her work and, exhausted, falls ill. When she recovers, Osono clandestinely arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. After Kiki apologizes for missing the party, Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms to Tombo but is intimidated by his friends, and walks home.\n\nKiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji, who has befriended a pretty white cat. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Kiki has a surprise visit from Ursula, who determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of [[Writer's block|artist's block]]. Ursula suggests that if Kiki can find a new purpose, she will regain her powers.\n\nWhile Kiki is visiting a customer, she witnesses an airship accident on television. A strong gust leaves Tombo hanging in mid-air. Kiki regains her flying power and manages to rescue him. She regains her confidence, resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n!

According to Helen McCarthy, the \"vibrant\" Stockholm-inspired city gives a sense of safety as well as independence.<ref>[[Helen McCarthy]]. ''Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation''. Stone Bridge Press (Berkeley, CA), 1999. {{ISBN|1-880656-41-8}}. pp. 144 and 157.</ref>]]\n\nA major theme of the film is maturity.{{sfn|Camp|2007|p=178}} After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself.{{sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=154}} The concept of [[vulnerability]] is also examined closely in the film. Critic [[Mark Schilling]] notes a scene during Kiki's first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki's bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=82}}\n\nAnother theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow.{{sfn|Odell|2009|loc=''Kiki's Delivery Service (Majo no Takky\u016bbin)'' (1989)}} Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.{{sfn|Odell|2009|loc=''Kiki's Delivery Service (Majo no Takky\u016bbin)'' (1989)}}\n\nKiki's loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film.{{sfn|Napier|2005|p=163}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=152}} Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts.{{sfn|Napier|2005|p=163}}{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=85}} This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=85}} Jiji had served as the wiser voice ([[imaginary friend|imaginary companion]]) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. At the end of the film when Kiki overcomes her personal challenges, she is still unable to understand Jiji, signifying her newfound maturity and wisdom.{{sfn|[[The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness]]|2013}}\n\nIn relation to Kiki's portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a [[black cat]] companion for Kiki,{{sfn|Napier|2005|p=162}} Kiki's use of a broom for flight, and her black dress.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=84}} While [[magical girl|girls with magical powers]] are common in [[Japanese television]], Miyazaki noted that, \"the witchcraft has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls. They have always become idols with no difficulties.\" In contrast, Kiki cannot use her powers as a means of wish fulfillment.<ref name=Nausicaa.net>{{cite web|last=Miyazaki|first=Hayao|title=The Hopes and Spirit of Contemporary Japanese Girls|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/kiki_foreword.html|work=The Art of Kiki's Delivery Service|publisher=Nausicaa.net|access-date=11 October 2013|archive-date=June 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612185858/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/kiki_foreword.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKiki has also been compared to other characters in [[List of works by Hayao Miyazaki#Filmography|Miyazaki's films]]. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'', a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in [[Nausica\u00e4 (Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind)|Nausica\u00e4]] in ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]''.<ref name=Napier2>{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Susan J.|title=Confronting Master Narratives: History As Vision in Miyazaki Hayao's Cinema of De-assurance|journal=Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique|year=2001|volume=9|issue=2|page=474|issn= \t1067-9847|doi=10.1215/10679847-9-2-467|s2cid=144130648}}</ref> Kiki is also compared to [[Chihiro]] of ''[[Spirited Away]]'' as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious.

Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on \"her good heart\" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises.{{sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=142}} Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki gets attacked by many crows, losing her powers or the [[airship]] incident at the film's climax, are not present in the original story. In order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.{{sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=142}} One such challenge is Kiki's sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki's broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=82}} Miyazaki remarked, \"As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original\".<ref name=\"KF\"/> Kadono was unhappy with the changes made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage.{{sfn|Camp|2007|p=179}} Miyazaki and [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], the producer of Ghibli, went to the author's home and invited her to the film's studio.

This dub was also one of Canadian-American comedian and actor [[Phil Hartman]]'s last voice-acting performances (as Jiji) as he died on May 28, 1998. The dub is therefore dedicated to his memory. The Disney English dub of ''Kiki's Delivery Service'' premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998. It was released to VHS on September 1, 1998. A few weeks later, Disney released another VHS of the movie, this time with the original Japanese soundtrack and with both English and Japanese subtitles. A bilingual [[Laserdisc]] version also became available at this time, containing English PCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks and Japanese mono audio on the analog left channel. The [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD was released on April 15, 2003 alongside the releases of ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''. It was again reissued on Region 1 DVD in March 2010 along with ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''Castle in the Sky'' as a tribute to the home release of ''[[Ponyo]]'', with this version altered from the original English dub.
