After forcing themselves to try online dating one night, they go on separate dates. Sasha's ends in disaster, while Paige has a good date with Tim, a young and charming doctor.\n\nSasha continues to have a string of bad dates and failed relationships, while Paige and Tim continue dating. Tim eventually proposes to Paige and she accepts. Sasha begins to feel excluded as Paige begins to focus more on Tim and their relationship, while Paige begins to feel that Sasha is childish, as Paige hates the girls Sasha dates and does not think much of her lack of direction. At a barbecue that Paige and Tim host, they try to set up Sasha with a woman they think of as kind and reliable. When Sasha blows her off, Paige and Sasha have a falling-out and stop speaking to one another.\n\nSasha gets fired from her job over her poor performance. She later runs into Tim, who is also having a difficult time in his relationship with Paige, who is constantly trying to control him and refuses to apologize. While there, Tim also tells Sasha that it is fine for her to give up on her dream of being a musician if that is no longer what she is passionate about. The conversation leaves Sasha with a better impression of Tim.\n\nRealizing that she is too stubborn, Paige apologizes to Tim. Sometime later, as she is driving her car, she sees Sasha out driving. The two begin to honk at each other and shout at each other in pretend anger, a joke that they played on one another when they were friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Paige Kearns\n* [[Leighton Meester]] as Sasha Weiss\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Tim\n* [[Greer Grammer]] as Mia\n* [[Gabourey Sidibe]] as Jen\n* [[Julie White]] as Deborah\n* [[Abby Elliott]] as Vanessa\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Trace\n* [[Mark Feuerstein]] as Casey\n* [[Monte Markham]] as Ken\n* [[Rosanna DeSoto]] as woman in car\n* [[Elizabeth Ho]] as Valerie\n* Simone Bailly as Angelica\n* Beth Dover as Jenn\n* Zee James as Claire\n}}\n\n==Production==\nSusanna Fogel and Joni Lefkowitz met in 2002 at a sketch comedy writing class and became friends.<ref name=\"prodnotes\">{{cite web|title=Magnolia Pictures :: Press Kit (download Life Partners production notes)|url=http://www.magpictures.com/presskit.aspx?id=cf3d8461-03c8-4563-9a88-4c4d7607f12e|website=Magpictures.com|access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref> Lefkowitz and Fogel both starred in the 2008 web series ''Joni & Susanna''.<ref name=\"afterellen\">{{cite web|last=Bendix |first=Trish |title=Leighton Meester and Gillian Jacobs are \"Life Partners\" |url=http://www.afterellen.com/2013/05/leighton-meester-and-gillian-jacobs-are-life-partners |website=[[AfterEllen]] |access-date=June 22, 2013 |date=May 8, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130624205000/http://www.afterellen.com/2013/05/leighton-meester-and-gillian-jacobs-are-life-partners |archivedate=June 24, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film is an adaptation of the play ''Life Partners'', written by Lefkowitz and Fogel based on their friendship and similar to the one depicted in ''[[Walking and Talking]]'' by [[Nicole Holofcener]].<ref name=\"prodnotes\"/> In 2011, the play, starring [[Amanda Walsh]] and [[Shannon Woodward]],<ref name=\"afterellen\"/> was created and premiered as part of one-act play series ''Unscreened'',<ref name=\"prodnotes\"/> which develops and produces world-premiere short plays by some of Hollywood's fastest-rising writers and featuring multi-star casts.
