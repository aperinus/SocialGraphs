He meets Jennifer \"Jenny\" Cavilleri, a quick-witted, working-class [[Radcliffe College]] student of classical music; they fall in love despite their differences. At Cornell, Oliver loses his temper during the hockey game, and Harvard loses to Cornell, 4-3. His father drives all the way to Ithaca, NY, only to see Harvard lose the game and Ivy League title. Oliver then turns down his father's offer of a ride back to Boston and help getting into Harvard Law School.\n\nOliver is upset that he does not figure in Jenny's plans to study in Paris. She accepts his marriage proposal and he takes her to the Barrett mansion to meet his parents, who are judgmental and unimpressed. Oliver's father says he will cut him off financially if he marries Jenny, but after graduation they marry, nonetheless.\n\nJenny works as a teacher but without his father's financial support, the couple struggle to pay Oliver's way through [[Harvard Law School]]. Oliver graduates third in his class and takes a position at a respectable New York City [[law firm]]. They are ready to start a family but fail to conceive. After many tests Oliver is told that Jenny is terminally ill.\n\nOliver attempts to continue as normal without telling Jenny of her condition, but she confronts her doctor and finds out the truth. Oliver buys tickets to Paris, but she declines to go, wanting only to spend time with him. Oliver seeks money from his estranged father to pay for Jenny's cancer therapy. His father asks if he has \"gotten a girl in trouble\". Oliver says yes, and his father writes a check.\n\nJenny makes funeral arrangements with her father from her hospital bed. She tells Oliver to not blame himself, insisting that he never held her back from music and it was worth it for the love they shared. Jenny's last wish is for Oliver to embrace her tightly as she dies.\n\nA grief-stricken Oliver leaves the hospital and he sees his father outside, who has rushed to New York City from Massachusetts to offer his help after learning about Jenny's condition. Oliver tells him, \"Jenny's dead,\" and his father says \"I'm sorry,\" to which Oliver responds, \"Love{{en dash}} [[Love means never having to say you're sorry]]\", something that Jenny had said to him earlier. Oliver walks alone to the open air ice rink, where Jenny had watched him skate the day she was hospitalized.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ali MacGraw]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Cavilleri\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Oliver Barrett IV\n* [[John Marley]] as Phil Cavilleri\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Oliver Barrett III\n* [[Russell Nype]] as Dean Thompson\n* [[Katharine Balfour]] as Mrs. Barrett\n* [[Sydney Walker]] as Dr. Shapeley\n* Robert Modica as Dr. Addison\n* Walker Daniels as Ray Stratton\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Hank Simpson (credited as Tom Lee Jones)\n* John Merensky as Steve\n* Andrew Duncan as Reverend Blaufelt\n\n==Production==\n[[Erich Segal]] originally wrote the screenplay and sold it to [[Paramount Pictures]]. While the film was being produced, Paramount wanted Segal to write a novel based on it, to be published on [[Valentine's Day]] to help pre-publicize the release of the film. When the novel was released, it became a bestseller on its own in advance of the film.\n\nThe original director was [[Larry Peerce]]. He backed out and was replaced by [[Anthony Harvey]]. Harvey dropped out and was replaced by Arthur Hiller. [[Jimmy Webb]] wrote a score for the film that was not used.\n\nThe lead role of Oliver Barrett IV was refused by [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Beau Bridges]], [[Michael York]] and [[Jon Voight]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ryan O'Neal: A Love-Hate Story|last=Lee|first= Grant|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=28 August 1977|page= q1}}</ref> [[Christopher Walken]] auditioned for the role,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2010/12/17/still-in-love/amp/|title=Still in 'Love'|date=December 17, 2010}}</ref> but Ryan O'Neal was cast on the recommendation of Erich Segal, who had worked with him on ''[[The Games (film)|The Games]]''; he was paid $25,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ryan O'Neal Has Plenty of Stories|last=Haber|first= Joyce|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=6 Dec 1970|page= v31}}</ref>\n\n[[Bill Cleary (ice hockey)|Bill Cleary]], former Harvard and 1960 U.S. Olympic hockey star (and later Harvard's hockey coach/athletic director), was Ryan O'Neal's hockey stand-in during key hockey scenes where skating and hockey-playing ability were required.

Other hockey players in the film were played mostly by actual Harvard and Boston University hockey players, including [[Joe Cavanagh]] and [[Mike Hyndman]]. \n\nFilming ''Love Story'' [[Location shooting|on location]] caused significant damage to the Harvard campus.

That she was beautiful and brilliant? That she loved Mozart and Bach? The Beatles? And me?}}\n\n{{blockquote|[[Love means never having to say you're sorry]].}}\n\nThe latter is spoken twice in the film, once by Jennifer when Oliver is about to apologize to her for his anger. It is also spoken by Oliver to his father when his father says \"I'm sorry\" after hearing of Jennifer's death.\n\nThe quote made it to No. 13 onto the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|AFI's 100 Years ... 100&nbsp;Movie Quotes]], a list of top movie quotes.\n\nThe comedy ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972), which stars O'Neal, refers to this line at the end, when [[Barbra Streisand]]'s character says \"Love means never having to say you're sorry\", then bats her eyelashes. O'Neal's character responds in deadpan fashion, \"That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.\"\n\n==Sequels and remake==\nO'Neal and Milland reprised their roles for a [[sequel]], ''[[Oliver's Story (film)|Oliver's Story]]'', released in 1978. It was based on Segal's 1977 novel. The film begins with Jenny's funeral, then picks up 18 months later. Oliver is a successful, but unhappy, lawyer in New York. Although still mourning Jenny, he manages to find love with heiress Marcie Bonwit ([[Candice Bergen]]). Suffering from comparisons to the original, ''Oliver's Story'' did poorly with both audiences and critics.\n\n[[NBC]] broadcast ''[[Love Story (1973 TV series)|Love Story]]'', a short-lived romantic anthology television series, in 1973\u20131974. Although it shared its name with the novel and movie and used the same theme song &ndash; \"[[(Where Do I Begin) Love Story]]\" &ndash; as the movie, it otherwise was unrelated to them, with no characters or storylines in common with either the novel or the movie.\n\nThe original film was remade in [[India]] in the [[Hindi]] language entitled ''[[Sanam Teri Kasam (2016 film)|Sanam Teri Kasam]]'' in 2016. The film is a modern rendition of the novel ''Love Story'' by Eric Segal. The film was released worldwide on 5 February 2016 under the production banner of Eros Now.\n\nIn February 2021, remodeled [[ViacomCBS]] streaming service [[Paramount+]] announced a remake of ''Love Story'' as a [[TV series]], to be part of their new lineup of content. The series is to be produced by young adult stalwarts [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], made prominent due to young adult hits such as ''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' and ''[[Looking for Alaska (TV series)|Looking for Alaska]]''. It is to be made for Schwartz and Savage's production house, [[Fake Empire Productions|Fake Empire]], as a co-production between [[Paramount Television Studios]] and [[CBS Studios]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/love-story-fatal-attraction-parallax-view-italian-job-flashdance-tv-shows-a-go-at-paramount|title='Love Story,' 'Fatal Attraction,' 'Parallax View,' 'Italian Job,' 'Flashdance' TV Shows a Go at Paramount+|date=February 24, 2021|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Ali MacGraw's \"disease\"== <!-- Movie illness redirects here -->\n[[Vincent Canby]] wrote in his original ''New York Times'' review that it was \"as if Jenny was suffering from some vaguely unpleasant [[Elizabeth Arden]] treatment\".<ref name=\"canby\" /> ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine ran a parody of the film (\"Lover's Story\") in its October 1971 issue, which depicted Ali MacGraw's character as stricken with \"Old Movie Disease\", an ailment that causes a dying patient to become \"more beautiful by the minute\".<ref>Siegel, Larry (October 1971). \"Lover's Story\".
