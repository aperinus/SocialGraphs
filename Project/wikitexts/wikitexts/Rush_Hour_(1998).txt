It stars [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Chris Tucker]] as mismatched police officers who are assigned to rescue a Chinese diplomat's abducted daughter. [[Tzi Ma]], [[Tom Wilkinson]], [[Ken Leung]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Rex Linn]] play supporting roles. Released on September 18, 1998, the film grossed over $244&nbsp;million worldwide. The film's box office commercial success led to [[Rush Hour (film series)|two sequels]]: ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'' (2001) and ''[[Rush Hour 3]]'' (2007).\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|last day of British rule]] of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, Detective Inspector Lee of the [[Hong Kong Police Force|Royal Hong Kong Police Force]] leads a raid at the wharf, hoping to arrest the unidentified, anonymous crime lord Juntao. He finds only Sang, Juntao's right-hand man, who escapes in a boat. Lee recovers numerous Chinese cultural treasures stolen by Juntao, which he presents as a farewell victory gift to his departing superiors, Chinese consul Solon Han and British [[Commander#British police rank|police commander]] Thomas Griffin. Two months later, after Han takes up his new diplomatic post in Los Angeles, his daughter Soo Yung is kidnapped by Sang while on her way to school. Han calls Lee to assist in the case, but the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], afraid Lee's involvement could cause an international incident, pawns him off on the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. Detective James Carter is tricked into \"babysitting\" Lee as punishment for botching a sting operation; when he finds out, he decides to solve the case.\n\nCarter takes Lee on a sightseeing tour, keeping him away from the embassy while contacting informants about the kidnapping. Lee makes his own way to the Chinese Consulate, where Han and the FBI await news about his daughter. While arguing with Special Agent-in-charge Warren Russ, Carter unwittingly negotiates with Sang, arranging a $50 million ransom drop. The FBI traces the call to a warehouse, where a team of agents are killed by [[plastic explosive]]. Spotting Sang nearby, Lee and Carter give chase but he escapes, dropping the detonator. Carter's colleague, LAPD bomb expert Tania Johnson, traces it to Clive, a man previously arrested by Carter. Lee presses Clive into revealing his business relationship with Juntao, whom he met at a restaurant in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]], earning Carter's trust. Carter goes to the restaurant alone and sees a surveillance video of Juntao carrying Soo Yung into a van. Lee arrives and saves Carter from Juntao's syndicate, but they are taken off the case as the FBI blames them for the botched ransom drop, with Lee sent back to Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, Carter refuses to give up and appeals to Johnson for assistance to sneak on board Lee's plane, where he persuades the Hong Kong detective to help stop Juntao together. Griffin later involves himself in the case, revealing more about the HKPF's past with Juntao's syndicate, and implores Han to pay the ransom to avoid further bloodshed. At the opening of a Chinese art exhibition at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]], overseen by Han and Griffin, the now $70 million ransom is delivered, and Carter, Lee, and Johnson enter disguised as guests. Carter orders the guests to evacuate for safety, angering the FBI, but Lee catches Griffin accepting a remote for the detonator from Sang. Lee and Johnson realize Griffin is Juntao when Carter recognizes him from the Chinatown surveillance tape.\n\nGriffin threatens to detonate a bomb vest attached to Soo Yung and demands that the ransom be paid in full, as compensation for the priceless Chinese artifacts which Lee recovered in his raid. Carter sneaks out, locates Soo Yung in the van, and drives it into the building within range of Griffin, preventing him from setting off the vest. Johnson gets the vest off Soo Yung, while Griffin heads to the roof with the bag of money. Lee takes the vest and pursues Griffin, while Carter shoots Sang dead in a gunfight. Lee has a brief altercation with Griffin that culminates in both dangling from the rafters. Griffin, holding on to the vest, falls to his death when its straps are torn, but when Lee falls, Carter catches him with a large flag. Han and Soo Yung are reunited, and Han sends Carter and Lee on vacation to Hong Kong as a reward. Before Carter leaves, agents Russ and Whitney offer him a position in the FBI, which he mockingly refuses. Carter boards the plane with Lee, who annoyingly starts singing [[Edwin Starr]]'s \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" off-key.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Detective Inspector Lee, a top Hong Kong cop who comes to Los Angeles to help his friend find his kidnapped daughter.\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Detective James Carter, a fast-talking street-smart LAPD Detective originally assigned by the FBI to babysit Lee and keep him out of their investigation.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Thomas Griffin/Juntao, a British diplomat and colleague of Han's who is secretly the top crime lord in Hong Kong.\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Consul Solon Han, Soo Yung's father and a Hong Kong diplomat who has just moved to Los Angeles.\n* [[Ken Leung]] as Sang, Juntao's second in command.\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Detective Tania Johnson, an aspiring bomb squad technician in the LAPD who helps Carter rescue Soo-Yung.\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Special Agent Warren Russ of the FBI.\n* [[Rex Linn]] as FBI agent Dan Whitney.\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Clive Cod, a small time [[arms industry|arms dealer]] who was arrested by Carter in a botched sting operation.\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Captain Bill Diel, Carter's supervisor.  He gives Carter the FBI assignment as punishment for a botched undercover sting operation.\n* Julia Hsu as Soo-Yung Han, Consul Han's daughter who is kidnapped by a criminal organization. She is also a martial arts student of Lee's.\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as \"Stucky\", Carter's informant.\n* [[Clifton Powell]] as Luke, Carter's cousin and local crime lord.\n* [[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Bobby, a security guard.\n\n== Production ==\n''Rush Hour'' began as a spec script written in 1995 by screenwriter [[Ross LaManna]]. The screenplay was sold by LaManna's [[William Morris Agency|William Morris]] agent Alan Gasmer to [[Hollywood Pictures]], a division of the Walt Disney Company, with [[Arthur M. Sarkissian|Arthur Sarkissian]] attached as producer. After attaching director Ratner and developing the project for more than a year with producers including Sarkissian, [[Jonathan Glickman]] and [[Roger Birnbaum]], Disney Studios chief [[Joe Roth]] put the project into turnaround, citing concerns about the $34&nbsp;million budget, and Chan's appeal to American audiences. At the time, [[Martin Lawrence]] was attached to the project. Several studios were interested in acquiring the project. [[New Line Cinema]] was confident in Ratner, having done ''[[Money Talks (1997 film)|Money Talks]]'' with him, so they made a hard commitment to a budget and start date for ''Rush Hour''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/06/business/fi-29697 |title=Studios Were in Passing Lane for 'Rush Hour' |last=Eller |first=Claudia |date=October 6, 1998 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=April 28, 2020 |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307035920/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/06/business/fi-29697 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Wesley Snipes]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Dave Chappelle]] were considered for the role of Detective James Carter; Murphy turned down the role to do ''[[Holy Man]]'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ix4ADUCCG9c |title=Martin Lawrence & Wesley Snipes almost played Chris Tucker's role in Rush Hour &#124; EPISODE 18 - YouTube |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 13, 2021 |archive-date=July 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713223856/https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ix4ADUCCG9c |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/04/the-lost-roles-of-dave-chappelle.html |title=The Lost Roles of Dave Chappelle |access-date=June 13, 2021 |archive-date=June 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613154524/https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/04/the-lost-roles-of-dave-chappelle.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/04/the-lost-roles-of-eddie-murphy.html |title=The Lost Roles of Eddie Murphy |access-date=June 13, 2021 |archive-date=June 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613154511/https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/04/the-lost-roles-of-eddie-murphy.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', Brett Ratner wanted to put Jackie Chan in a buddy-cop movie, not as a co-star or sidekick but on equal footing with an American star.
