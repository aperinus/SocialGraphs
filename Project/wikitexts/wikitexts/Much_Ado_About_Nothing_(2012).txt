The film stars [[Amy Acker]], [[Alexis Denisof]], [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Clark Gregg]], [[Reed Diamond]], [[Fran Kranz]], [[Sean Maher]], and [[Jillian Morgese]].\n\nTo create the film, director Whedon established the production studio [[Bellwether Pictures]]. The film premiered at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and had its North American theatrical release on June 21, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot of the film is largely unchanged from that of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Much Ado About Nothing|original play]]. Differences include the modern-day setting, switching Conrade's gender, eliminating several minor roles and consolidating others into Leonato's aide, and expanding Ursula's role by giving her a number of Margaret's scenes.  In addition, the film attempts to add background to the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick by showing, in an opening scene, a morning after they apparently slept together. Benedick steals away quietly while Beatrice pretends to be asleep.  Benedick is beardless, so this is presumably some time before the plot of the movie takes place.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amy Acker]] as [[Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing)|Beatrice]], niece of Leonato.\n* [[Alexis Denisof]] as Benedick, of Padua; companion of Don Pedro.\n* [[Reed Diamond]] as [[Don Pedro (Shakespeare character)|Don Pedro]], Prince of Aragon.\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as [[Dogberry]], the constable in charge of Messina's night watch.\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Leonato, governor of Messina; Hero's father.\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Claudio, of Florence; a count, companion of Don Pedro, friend to Benedick.\n* [[Sean Maher]] as Don John, \"the Bastard Prince,\" brother of Don Pedro.\n* [[Jillian Morgese]] as [[Hero (Much Ado About Nothing)|Hero]], Leonato's daughter.\n* [[Spencer Treat Clark]] as Borachio, follower of Don John.\n* [[Riki Lindhome]] as Conrade, lover of Don John (originally, follower of Don John, a male role).\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Margaret, waiting-gentlewoman attendant on Hero.\n* Emma Bates as Ursula, waiting-gentlewoman attendant on Hero.\n* [[Tom Lenk]] as Verges, the Headborough, Dogberry's partner\n* [[BriTANicK|Nick Kocher]] as first watchman\n* [[BriTANicK|Brian McElhaney]] as second watchman\n* Joshua Zar as Leonato's aide\n* Paul M.
