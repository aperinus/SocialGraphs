The film was directed by [[Bryan Singer]] and stars [[Ian McKellen]], [[Brad Renfro]], [[Bruce Davison]], [[Elias Koteas]] and [[David Schwimmer]]. Set in the 1980s in southern California, the film tells the story of high school student Todd Bowden (Renfro), who discovers a fugitive [[Nazi]] [[war criminal]], Kurt Dussander (McKellen), living in his neighborhood under a pseudonym. Bowden, obsessed with Nazism and the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share his stories, and their relationship stirs malice in each of them. Singer has called ''Apt Pupil'' \"a study in cruelty\", with Nazism serving as a vehicle to demonstrate the capacity of evil.\n\nThe film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million. The main actors won several minor awards for their performances.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Southern California]] in 1984, 16-year-old high school student Todd Bowden discovers that his elderly neighbor, Arthur Denker, is Kurt Dussander&nbsp;\u2014 a former [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] commandant who is now a fugitive [[war crime|war criminal]]. Todd, fascinated with Nazi atrocities perpetrated during World War II, blackmails Dussander, forcing him to share disturbing stories of what it was like working at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s and how it felt to participate in [[genocide]].\n\nTodd purchases an SS uniform from a costume shop and forces Dussander to wear it. As he spends more time with Dussander, his schoolwork suffers, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. Dussander begins blackmailing Todd in return, forcing him to work to restore his grades by threatening to expose the subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French. Talking about the war crimes affects both the old man and the young boy. An intoxicated Dussander tries and fails to kill a cat with his gas oven. Dussander also takes pride in Todd's turnaround, going from near-dropout to straight As in a matter of weeks.\n\nOne night, Dussander tries to kill a homeless person who earlier had seen him in the uniform. When Dussander has a [[heart attack]], he calls Todd, who finishes the killing, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his room. He is arrested and an extradition to [[Israel]] is arranged. Todd graduates as [[valedictorian]] and gives a speech about [[Icarus]], saying, \"All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness.\" The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the corpse being found in the basement.\n\nTodd is questioned about his relationship with Dussander and he convinces the police that he knew nothing of the man's true identity. A group of [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] demonstrates outside the hospital; realizing his situation is hopeless, Dussander commits suicide by giving himself an [[air embolism]]. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails French into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"floatright\" style=\"padding: 1em; border-spacing: 1px; border: 1px solid darkgray; background-color: #F8F9FA; width:22em; font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!

Screenwriter Brandon Boyce described Dussander as being \"a composite of these ghosts of World War II\" but not based on any real-life individual.  McKellen was attracted to the role because he was impressed with Singer's ''The Usual Suspects'' and saw the role of Dussander as \"a nice, meaty part and difficult\".<ref name=\"young\">{{cite news | last=Welkos | first=Robert W. | title=Young director follows up 'Usual Suspects' | work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] | date=May 4, 1997 }} (Reprinted from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.)</ref>  Singer, who enjoyed McKellen in [[John Schlesinger]]'s 1995 film ''[[Cold Comfort Farm (film)|Cold Comfort Farm]]'', invited the actor to take the role.<ref>{{cite news | last=Rea | first=Steven | title=Playing evil character a challenge for McKellen | work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] | date=October 23, 1998}}</ref> The character's language was written originally for \"a very stoic German\", but Singer felt that McKellen's \"complex\" personality could contribute to the character. The director said of choosing McKellen, \"I felt if I could combine his complexity, his colorfulness, to the stoic German character it would create a character that, although evil, would garner more sympathy and would be more enjoyable for the audience to watch.\"<ref name=\"scapperotti\" />\n\nBrad Renfro stars alongside McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned a couple hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, \"Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, and by the end of the picture he had to become this empty vessel.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Bob | title=Renfro's Slow Rise: 'Apt' star waits for right roles | work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date=November 5, 1998}}</ref><ref name=\"good\" /> Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind.

This particular individual came along before some other, but it perhaps could have been drugs, it could have been rape. Todd was probably not a very good guy.

Kobritz met with actor [[James Mason]] to play the novella's war criminal Kurt Dussander, but Mason died in July 1984 before production as a result of a heart attack. The producer also approached [[Richard Burton]] for the role, but Burton also died in August that same year. By 1987 production on the film began with [[Nicol Williamson]] cast as Kurt Dussander, and 17-year-old [[Rick Schroder]] was cast as Todd Bowden. In that year, [[Alan Bridges]] began direction of the film with a script co-written by [[Ken Wheat]] and his brother Jim Wheat. After ten weeks of filming, the production suffered from a lack of funds from its production company Granat Releasing, and the film had to be placed on hold. Kubritz sought to revive production, but when the opportunity came a year later, Schroder had aged too considerably for the film to work. Forty minutes of usable footage was abandoned.<ref name=\"cursed\">{{cite news | last=Karger | first=Dan | url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295426,00.html | title=King's Cursed Movie | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=December 13, 1996 | access-date=February 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Direction under Bryan Singer===\n[[File:BryanSinger edited.jpg|thumbnail|right|Director Bryan Singer in 2006]]\n[[Bryan Singer]] first read ''Apt Pupil'' when he was 19 years old, and when he became a director, he wanted to adapt the novella into a film. In 1995, Singer asked his friend and screenwriter Brandon Boyce to write a [[spec script]] adapting the novella.  Boyce recalled the writing process, \"I thought it was a great stageplay, actually ... two people, pretty much in a house talking.  My script was completely on spec, so, if it didn't work out, at least I'd have a writing sample.\" When the original option to the novella expired in 1995, Stephen King sued to get the rights back. Singer and Boyce then provided to King a first draft of their script and a copy of Singer's film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), which had yet to be publicly released.<ref name=\"unusual\">{{cite news | last=Dretzka | first=Gary | title=Unusual Suspects: Filmmaker Bryan Singer's decision to interpret Stephen King isn't the most likely pairing | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=October 11, 1998}}</ref> Impressed with Singer,<ref name=\"cursed\" /> King optioned the rights to the director for $1, arranging to be compensated when the film was released.<ref name=\"scary\">{{cite news | last=Welkos | first=Robert W. | title=So young, he's scary: Director Singer moves from 'Suspects' to Stephen King story | work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] | date=May 22, 1997 }} (Reprinted from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.)</ref> Singer said of King's ultimate response to the film, despite some changes made to the source material, \"Stephen loved it.

The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept.\" The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of [[Pol Pot]]'s executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. \"It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them,\" Singer said.<ref name=\"streak\" /> To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols.<ref name=\"limit\">{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Bob | title=Evil knows no age limit in 'Apt Pupil' | work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date=October 23, 1998}}</ref> He was also attracted to the film as \"[an] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible thing that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood\".<ref>{{cite news | last=Rodriguez | first=Rene | title=Dark satires give the 'burbs a caustic cast | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | date=October 18, 1998}}</ref>\n\nSinger turned down directing opportunities with films like ''[[The Truman Show]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Own]]'' after the success of ''The Usual Suspects''. He instead pursued ''Apt Pupil'': \"It was a very dark subject matter, and it was something that came from passion.\" He acknowledged in retrospect that ''Apt Pupil'' \"wasn't really supposed to be a big success\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mottram|2007|p=219}}</ref> Singer was financially supported by producer [[Scott Rudin]] and the production company Spelling Films.

The director used the name of his high school football team, the Pirates, and the green-and-gold team colors in the film, saying, \"I just projected my own childhood right out to Southern California.\"<ref name=\"challenge\">{{cite news | last=Stein | first=Ruthe | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/10/11/PK85667.DTL | title=Apt Pupil's Unusual Suspect: Director Bryan Singer takes on challenge of adapting Stephen King's Nazi thriller | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=October 11, 1998 | access-date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Editing and composition===\n[[John Ottman]] served as both film editor and music composer for ''Apt Pupil''. When he edited the film, he found it a challenge to create the proper musical score. Ottman recalled, \"Normally, an editor will score scenes with temporary music from CDs, and so forth, and nothing I could find worked for this film.\" The composer sought a mix between the scores of the science fiction film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) and the military-based comedy ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979) to create an \"otherworldly pastiche\". Ottman said of his approach:<ref name=\"editor\">{{cite news | last=Dretzka | first=Gary | title=Apt Pupil's film editor knows the score | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=October 11, 1998}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>When you throw a cat in the oven, it's easy to have someone in the orchestra slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring the hell out of everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene ... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.</blockquote>\n\nAnother scene in which Ottman meshed his editing and composing duties was when Dussander wakes up in the hospital with the television show ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, \"I used ''The Jeffersons'' as this innocuous thing\u2014going between him and the television\u2014so that when he does open his eyes, it scares the hell out of you ... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound.\" Ottman recorded the film's score with the [[Seattle Symphony]].<ref name=\"editor\" />\n\n==Critical analysis==\n===Obsession with Nazism and the Holocaust===\nIn ''The Films of Stephen King'', Dennis Mahoney writes that the obsession with [[Nazism]] and [[the Holocaust]] that unfolds in ''Apt Pupil'' is the result of the paternal bond between Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander and high school student Todd Bowden. Such bonds are common themes in Stephen King's works: \"King's portrayal of evil most often appears to require an active, illicit bond between a male (often in the role of a father or father surrogate) and a younger, formerly innocent individual (often in the role of a biological or surrogate progeny) who is initiated into sin\".<ref name=\"mahoney26\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=26}}</ref> In the film, the year 1984 highlights, in addition to [[Orwellian]] overtones, the time in American history in which the Holocaust is treated as a week-long course with little time \"to be tempered with self-questioning as to the motivations behind it\".<ref name=\"mahoney27\" /> Bowden's obsession with the Holocaust is a key plot device \"wherein the past has this unbreakable hold on the present\". The film's opening sequence shows how Bowden treats this history as a [[simulacrum]] in which the history becomes his own, as evidenced by his head's brief overlapping with the Nazis he is studying. Though history becomes alive for Bowden, he perceives it through the perpetrators (namely Dussander) and not through the victims, characterizing Bowden as \"apt\" in the sense of \"a natural tendency to ... undesirable behavior\".<ref name=\"mahoney28\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=28}}</ref>\n\nMahoney says language serves as \"a vehicle for corruption\", as Dussander tells Bowden horrific stories of his service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin. Bowden, in listening to the stories, becomes \"a vampiric extension of the evil\" that Dussander exhibits.<ref name=\"mahoney28\" /> The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to have nightmares, and for Bowden, the nightmares are \"a past that is becoming ever more present\".<ref name=\"mahoney28\u201329\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> One of the key motifs of the film is that \"a door was opened that could not be shut\", referring to Dussander's confession about following orders and being unable to hold back.<ref name=\"mahoney29\" /> The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a [[Schutzstaffel]] uniform and to march to Bowden's commands. Dussander continues marching despite Bowden's insistences to stop, emulating the premise of [[Goethe]]'s poem ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them. The scene is \"the figurative and literal turning point in the film\".<ref name=\"mahoney30\" />\n\n===Sadomasochism, homoeroticism, and homophobia===\nMahoney says that [[sadomasochism]], [[homoeroticism]], and [[homophobia]] are highlighted in Bryan Singer's retelling of Stephen King's novella.<ref name=\"mahoney30\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=30}}</ref> In ''Frames of Evil: The Holocaust as Horror in American Film'', Caroline Picart and David Frank write that the face of evil is represented in the film as Nazism, oft labeled as \"quintessentially innate [and] supernaturally crafty\", but also \"in a more subterranean way, dangerously blurring ... the boundaries between homoeroticism and [[homosexuality]]\".<ref name=\"picart100\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=100}}</ref> The Nazi monstrosity in ''Apt Pupil'' is structured through sexual \"abnormality\", where a series of binary dichotomies are introduced: \"normal versus monstrous, [[heterosexual]] versus homosexual, and healthy versus sick\". An additional dichotomy, victimizer (masculinized) versus victim (feminized), reflects the film's \"hidden tensions\" in which Bowden and Dussander's roles of powers are reversible. While the \"set of perversions\" that unfold in the novella are misogynistic, the film unfolds the set as \"ambivalently homoerotic and homophobic\".<ref name=\"picart102\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=102}}</ref> The film removes the novella's misogyny and leaves intact the underlying homoeroticism of the central characters. The film also expounds the connection between homophobia and how male Holocaust victims are portrayed.<ref name=\"picart109\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=109}}</ref>\n\nThe central characters Todd Bowden and Kurt Dussander are onscreen most of the time, and they are frequently framed in close proximity, which Picart and Frank describe as \"[intensifying] a homoerotic intimacy [which is] punctuated by dread of contact with the monstrous\".<ref name=\"picart109110\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|pp=109\u2013110}}</ref> Homoeroticism in ''Apt Pupil'' is further demonstrated by the focus on Todd's body. In the opening scene in which Bowden is in his bedroom during a stormy night, \"the ever-encroaching camera and the lighting fetishize Todd's youthful body\", similar to the fetishism of the female body in films like ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"picart110-111\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> This depiction creates a dualism in which \"he is now simultaneously dangerous and endangered\" in his homophobic and homoerotic ties to Nazism.<ref name=\"picart111\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=111}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to wear and in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more heightened in the film as \"more dominant and voyeuristic\", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, \"I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I want to see you in it. Now move!\" The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march.<ref name=\"picart112\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=112}}</ref> Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects \"the sexual difference between the characters\"; Bowden is masculinized as \"the bearer of the [sexual] gaze\", and Dussander is feminized as \"the object of the gaze\".<ref name=\"picart113\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=113}}</ref> The cutting between Bowden and Dussander \"corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images\" which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up [[shot reverse shot]] \"radically [ruptures] the structure of power\", where Bowden loses \"control of his sadistic power over Dussander\".<ref name=\"picart114\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=114}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between novella and film==\nStephen King's novella ''Apt Pupil'' begins in 1974, when Todd Bowden is in [[middle school|junior high]], and it ends with him graduating from [[High school (North America)|high school]]. In Bryan Singer's film, the story takes place fully in 1984, when Todd Bowden is in his last year in high school.<ref name=\"mahoney27\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=27}}</ref> In the novella, for three years leading to the end of the story, Todd Bowden and discovered Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander independently murder a large number of hobos and transients, whereas in the film, the murders are condensed to Dussander's attempt to kill the hobo Archie.<ref name=\"mahoney33\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=33}}</ref> Singer sought to reduce the novella's violence, not wanting it to appear \"exploitative or repetitive\".<ref name=\"good\">{{cite news | last=Schaefer | first=Stephen | title=Good out of evil: 'Usual Suspects' director brings Stephen King novella to film | work=[[Boston Globe]] | date=October 18, 1998}}</ref>  Unlike in the novella, animosity toward Jews was not explicitly displayed by the characters in the film.<ref name=\"mahoney29\">{{Harvnb|Mahoney|2008|p=29}}</ref>  The novella's dream sequence in which Bowden rapes a sixteen-year-old Jewish virgin as a laboratory experiment under Dussander's guidance was replaced by the film's dream sequence in which Bowden sees three shower-gas chamber scenes unfold.<ref name=\"picart105\">{{Harvnb|Picart|Frank|2006|p=105}}</ref> Reduced in the film was Todd's encounter with the schoolgirl Betty (named Becky in the film).
