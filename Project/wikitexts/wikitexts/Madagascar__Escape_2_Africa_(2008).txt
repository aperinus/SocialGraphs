It is the second installment in the [[Madagascar (franchise)|franchise]], following ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005). It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], with a screenplay written by [[Etan Cohen]], Darnell, and McGrath, and features [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Andy Richter]], [[Elisa Gabrielli]], McGrath, [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]], [[Christopher Knights]], and [[Conrad Vernon]] reprising their [[voice acting]] roles from the first film, joined by new cast members [[Bernie Mac]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Sherri Shepherd]],  and [[will.i.am]]. In the film, the main characters\u2014a party of animals from the [[Central Park Zoo]] whose adventures have taken them to Madagascar\u2014find themselves in Africa, where they meet others of their species and where Alex the lion reunites with his parents.\n\nReleased November 7, 2008, ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'' grossed $603.9 million on a $150 million budget, making it the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2008]].<ref name=\"BOM2008Worldwide\" /> It was dedicated to Bernie Mac, who died before the film's release.<ref name=\"PeopleRememberingMac\" /> A sequel, ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Africa]], a [[lion]] named Zuba tries to teach his son Alakay how to fight, but the cub is more interested in dancing. Rival male Makunga challenges Zuba for the title of [[alpha (ethology)|alpha]] lion, and during their fight Alakay is captured by [[poaching|poachers]]. The crate containing Alakay falls into the ocean and drifts to [[New York City]], where he is renamed Alex and grows up at the [[Central Park Zoo]] where he meets his lifelong best friends: Marty, Melman, and Gloria.\n\nYears later, following their adventure in [[Madagascar]], the zoo animals\u2014Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the [[penguin]]s, and the [[chimpanzee]]s\u2014prepare to return to New York aboard a battered airplane piloted by the penguins, accompanied by King Julien, Maurice, and Mort. The plane runs out of fuel and crash lands in continental Africa. The animals find themselves at a watering hole on a [[nature reserve]], and are excited to meet others of their species. Alex is reunited with his parents and impresses them with tales of his status as \"the king of New York\". Marty fits in with a herd of other zebras who look and sound just like him. Melman, a [[hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]], is distressed that the reserve has no doctors, so the other giraffes appoint him their [[witch doctor]]. Seeking romance, Gloria attracts the attention of the smooth-talking male hippo Moto Moto.\n\nMeanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane, assisted by numerous chimpanzees recruited by Mason and Phil. They steal vehicles from several groups of New Yorkers who are on [[safari]] and strip them for parts. Nana, a tough old woman who slapped Alex around during the events of ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', takes charge of the stranded tourists and helps them survive in the wilderness.\n\nThe zoo animals' excitement soon turns to disappointment. In a scheme to oust Zuba as alpha lion, Makunga insists that Alex complete a [[rite of passage]] which Alex mistakes for a talent contest. It is actually a fighting contest, and Makunga tricks him into choosing the strongest lion as his opponent, resulting in Alex's humiliating defeat. Faced with the duty of banishing his son, Zuba relinquishes his title as alpha and Makunga takes over. Meanwhile, Marty is dejected by the realization that the other zebras can do everything he can, believing himself no longer unique. Melman comes to believe that he is deathly ill, and Gloria's interest in Moto Moto saddens him since he has secretly loved her for a long time. The four friends argue heatedly with one another. Gloria has a date with Moto Moto, but loses interest when she realizes he is only attracted to her because of her size. After a pep talk from King Julien, Melman finally reveals his feelings for Gloria.\n\nThe next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to redeem himself, Alex mends his friendship with Marty and they leave the reserve to investigate upriver. King Julien suggests that offering a sacrifice to the nearby volcano will restore the water. Melman, forlorn and believing he is dying, volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him from jumping into the volcano, and realizes that he loves her for more than her appearance. Alex and Marty discover that the stranded New Yorkers have built a camp and dammed up the river, and Alex is captured by them. Zuba rushes to his aid, but Alex saves them both by dancing for the tourists, who remember him fondly from the zoo. Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and the chimpanzees (after settling a strike by the chimpanzees) arrive in the repaired airplane and help Alex destroy the dam, restoring the water. Makunga angrily makes a stand for control, but Alex tricks him into being subdued by Nana. Zuba offers Alex the title of alpha lion, but he declines, believing the title belongs to his father. Zuba claims the title belongs to them both, and father and son become co-leaders.\n\nSkipper marries a [[bobblehead]] doll from the plane, and he, the other penguins, and the chimpanzees head off to honeymoon in [[Monte Carlo]]. Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, and the lemurs happily decide to stay on the reserve for a while.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:ChrisRock.jpg|thumb|[[Chris Rock]] at the [[Israel]]i premiere of the film, on November 22, 2008.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex the [[lion]]\n** Quinn Dempsey Stiller, Ben Stiller's son, as baby Alex\n** Declan Swift as young Alex\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Marty the [[Plains zebra|zebra]], as well as the other zebras in the herd\n** Thomas Stanley as young Marty\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as Melman the [[Reticulated giraffe|giraffe]]\n** [[Zachary Gordon]] as young Melman\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Gloria the [[hippopotamus]]\n** [[Willow Smith]] as young Gloria\n* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as King Julien XIII the [[ring-tailed lemur]]\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Maurice the [[aye-aye]]\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort the [[Goodman's mouse lemur]]\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Zuba, Alex's father and the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]] lion\n* [[Sherri Shepherd]] as Florrie (credited as \"Mom\"), Alex's mother and Zuba's mate, her name \"Florrie\" isn't mentioned in the film\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Makunga the lion\n* [[Elisa Gabrielli]] as Nana\n* [[will.i.am]] as Moto Moto the hippopotamus\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper the [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin|penguin]]\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski the penguin\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private the penguin\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Mason the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] (Phil, the other main chimpanzee, is unvoiced)\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as Teetsi the lion and as one of the poachers who captures Alakay\n* [[Eric Darnell]] as Joe the giraffe and as one of the poachers who captures Alakay\n* [[Al Roker]] as a newscaster\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as Safari Tour Guide\n* Stephen Kearin as Stephen the giraffe, as a [[rhinoceros]], and as one of the New Yorkers\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as one of the New Yorkers\n* Dan O'Connor as a [[African buffalo|buffalo]] and as one of the New Yorkers\n* [[Fergie (singer)|Stacy Ferguson]] as a female hippopotamus\n* [[Harland Williams]] as a giraffe\n* [[Bridget Hoffman]] as one of the New Yorkers\n* David P.
