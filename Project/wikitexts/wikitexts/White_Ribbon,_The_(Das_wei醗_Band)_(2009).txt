The film also received two nominations at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] in 2009: [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] (representing Germany) and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Christian Berger]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe memories of an unnamed elderly tailor form a [[parable]] from the distant year he worked as a village schoolteacher and met his fianc\u00e9e Eva, a nanny. The setting is the fictitious [[Protestant]] village of Eichwald, Northern [[German Empire|Germany]], from July 1913 to 9 August 1914,<!--\"sunday mess after Beginning of war\"--> where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers.\n\nThe puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation, his son confesses to 'impure' touching;<!-- For those editors who would like to explicitly state that the son was accused of masturbation, please note that the film doesn't. The discussion on the subject led to a consensus that the plot summary remain consistent with the action of the film. --> the pastor has the boy\u2019s hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local [[midwife]], with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the [[lord of the manor]], underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.\n\nThe schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.\n\nUnexplained harmful events occur. A wire is stretched between two trees causing the doctor a terrible fall from his horse. The farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way; her son was the cabbage-field vandal, and her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baron\u2019s young son Sigi goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned. A barn at the manor burns down. The baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man. Shortly after the pastor has singled-out and mortified his daughter in class, she opens his parakeet's cage with scissors in hand; the pastor finds the bird on his desk, cruelly impaled in the shape of a cross. The daughter of the steward at the baron's estate claims a violent dream-premonition about harm coming to the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded, found during a night search along with a well-written note quoting [[Ten Commandments|Exodus 20:5]]. The steward violently thrashes his son for stealing a flute from Sigi.\n\nThe midwife urgently commandeers a bicycle from the schoolteacher to go to the police in town, claiming that her son has said he knows who attacked him. She and her son are not seen again. Meanwhile, the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's [[rectory]], where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them.  Offended, the pastor berates him and threatens to report him to the authorities if he repeats his accusations.\n\nThe film ends a few days after World War I [[World War I|officially begins]], with the final scene occurring in Sunday church on the day of a visit from the narrator's prospective father-in-law. Disquiet remains in the village, with no explanation of the violent events. The narrator is eventually [[Conscription in Germany|drafted]], leaving Eichwald, never to return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Christian Friedel]] as the school teacher\n* [[Ernst Jacobi]] as narrator (voice only, the school teacher as a much older man)\n* [[Leonie Benesch]] as Eva, nanny to the baron and baroness's twin babies for a short time\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as the baron\n* [[Ursina Lardi]] as the baroness, Marie-Louise\n* Fion Mutert as Sigmund, their oldest son\n* Michael Kranz as Sigmund's tutor\n* [[Burghart Klau\u00dfner]] as the pastor\n* [[Steffi K\u00fchnert]] as Anna, the pastor's wife\n* [[Maria-Victoria Dragus]] as Klara, their oldest daughter\n* [[Leonard Proxauf]] as Martin, their oldest son\n* Levin Henning as Adolf\n* Johanna Busse as Margarete\n* Thibault S\u00e9ri\u00e9 as Gustav\n* [[Josef Bierbichler]] as the baron's steward\n* Gabriela Maria Schmeide as Emma, his wife\n* Janina Fautz as Erna, their daughter\n* Enno Trebs as Georg\n* [[Theo Trebs]] as Ferdinand\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as the doctor\n* [[Roxane Duran]] as Anna, the doctor's daughter\n* [[Susanne Lothar]] as the midwife and doctor's assistant\n* Eddy Grahl as Karli, her son\n* Branko Samarovski as a peasant\n* [[Birgit Minichmayr]] as Frieda\n* Aaron Denkel as Kurti\n* [[Detlev Buck]] as Eva's father\n* Carmen-Maja Antoni as the bathing midwife\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Haneke]] has said the project was in development for more than ten years.<ref name=\"cineuropa\">{{cite web |url=http://cineuropa.org/interview.aspx?lang=en&documentID=108748 |title=Interview with Michael Haneke |last=Lemercier |first=Fabien |date=21 May 2009 |website=Cineuropa.org |publisher=Cineuropa |access-date=25 May 2009 }}</ref> The initial version of the script was written as a television mini-series for the Austrian broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], but when no co-producer who was willing to invest in the project had been found after five years had passed, Haneke decided to put the project on hold.<ref name=\"derstandard\">\nAustria Presse Agentur (23 April 2009) \"[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1240297981226 Michael Hanekes ist im Wettbewerb]\" (in German).
