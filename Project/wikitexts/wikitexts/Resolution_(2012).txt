Cilella plays a graphic designer and father-to-be named Michael who, after receiving a troubling email video of his drug-addicted best friend Chris (played by Curran), travels to a remote cabin to save him. The 2017 film [[The Endless (film)|''The Endless'']] shares the same creative universe as ''Resolution'', and may be interpreted as a partial sequel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thefilmstage.com/features/aaron-moorhead-and-justin-benson-on-creating-the-world-of-the-endless|title=Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson on Creating the World of 'The Endless'|date=2017-05-02|work=The Film Stage|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words.  This one is current 665 words long. -->\nMichael Danube, a [[graphic designer]] living in the city with his pregnant wife, receives an email containing a video of Chris Daniels, his best friend. Chris, a drug addict, has retreated to a remote rural area and has become delusional and erratic. A map is included with the video. Despite his wife's objections, Michael makes one last attempt to save Chris. He promises to return after one week and follows the map.\n\nAt his destination, Michael hears Chris ranting and shooting a pistol. Chris invites Michael in and starts ranting about various subjects. When Chris refuses to go into [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]], Michael subdues him with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]], handcuffs him and goes to a nearby town to shop for supplies. In the morning, Michael staves off an attempted attack from Chris.\n\nLater, Micah and Billy, Michael and Chris' old acquaintances, arrive and ask for their drug, which Chris is holding. After Michael drives them off, Chris warns him against messing with them, as they have become violent and unpredictable. As he takes a walk, Michael meets members of a [[UFO religion]], then returns to the house and finds a set of strange photographs. Micah and Billy return, but Charles, a [[Indian tribal police|tribal security]] guard chases them off. Charles tells Michael that Chris is squatting on reservation land, but accepts Michael's bribe in exchange for letting them stay for five days.\n\nAfter they discover creepy film footage, Chris denies sending any emails or videos. Michael finds a book full of creepy campfire stories on their doorstep, and, when he returns the book to the library, finds film slides. Confused by the items that seem purposefully left for them to find, Michael suggests that it is a prank by Billy and Micah, which Chris dismisses.\n\nMichael continues to find clues strewn about the area. When he bribes Charles for information, Charles warns him against digging into the past, only saying French students used the area for research. They encounter a [[con artist]] who offers to buy the house and leaves after Michael says that they are only \"renting.\" Michael re-watches the video he received in the e-mail and finds it has changed, it now shows an argument that Michael and Chris had moments before. Billy and Micah return and kill a dog that Chris had adopted, and Chris reveals that he is suicidal.\n\nMichael tracks down the dog's original owner, an archeologist named Byron, a member of the original French research team. Byron, who smokes a hallucinogenic drug that is red in colour, suggests that the two other students researchers were looking for monsters and found themselves.  Byron believes the area is not haunted; instead, \"something\" there desires stories. While reflecting a small mirror into a large one, creating an infinity of reflections of himself and Michael, Byron stresses the need for a beginning, middle, and end. Unnerved by Byron's eccentricity, Michael leaves.\n\nAs more clues appear from nowhere, the film projector Michael has been using turns on and projects the gruesome deaths and funeral photos of himself and Chris. Michael's laptop plays a video depicting their deaths at the hands of Micah and Billy. The two flee the house, only to find a CD that has a recording of Charles murdering them and burning down the house. Chris wants to leave the property immediately; Michael, however, does not want to bring the curse home and wants to appease the entity instead. Upon returning to the house, they witness Charles and a companion from the reservation killing Micah and Billy, after which Charles and his companion set the house on fire. Chris and Michael panic; Chris breaks down and finally agrees to go to rehab.  Their joy over achieving a happy ending to their story is abruptly cut short when the entity angrily confronts them. Chris kneels before it and apologizes profusely, and Michael asks the entity, \"Can we try it another way?\" The only reply he gets is an explosive roar from the creature.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Peter Cilella as Michael Danube\n* Vinny Curran as Chris Daniels\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as Charles\n* [[Bill Oberst Jr.]] as Byron\n* Kurt David Anderson as Billy\n* Skyler Meacham as Micah\n* [[Justin Benson (director)|Justin Benson]] as Justin, UFO Cult Member\n* [[Aaron Moorhead|Aaron Scott Moorhead]] as Aaron, UFO Cult Member\n\n== Production ==\nAlthough the film is often described as \"genre-bending\", this was not an intentional concept; it was always meant as a horror film about an unseen antagonist that manipulates reality to create interesting stories.  The detox plotline was introduced to give the story more structure, as the directors needed a plot device to have the story unfold over seven days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aintitcool.com/node/64630|title=AICN HORROR talks with Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, the directors of RESOLUTION!
