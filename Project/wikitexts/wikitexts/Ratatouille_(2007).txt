[[List of Pixar films|The eighth film produced by Pixar]], it was written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], who took over from [[Jan Pinkava]] in 2005, and produced by [[Brad Lewis]], from an original idea by Jan Pinkava.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chang |first=Justin |date=2007-06-18 |title=Film Review: Ratatouille |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/awards/ratatouille-2-1200558501/ |access-date=2022-09-20 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> The title refers to the French dish [[ratatouille]], which is served at the end of the film, and also references the species of the main character, a rat. Set in [[Paris]], the plot follows a rat who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an unlikely alliance with a restaurant's garbage boy.\n\nThe film stars the voices of [[Patton Oswalt]] as Remy, an [[anthropomorphic]] rat who is interested in cooking; [[Lou Romano]] as Alfredo Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; [[Ian Holm]] as Skinner, the [[head chef]] of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant; [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Colette Tatou, a ''[[r\u00f4tisseur]]'' at Gusteau's restaurant and the staff's only female chef; [[Peter O'Toole]] as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; [[Brian Dennehy]] as Django, Remy's father and leader of his clan; [[Peter Sohn]] as Emile, Remy's older brother; and [[Brad Garrett]] as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef.\n\nDevelopment for ''Ratatouille'' began in 2000 when Pinkava wrote the original concepts of the film, although he was never named the formerly director of the film. In 2005, following Pinkava's departure from Pixar for lacking confidence in the story development, Bird was approached to direct the film and revise the story. Bird and some of the film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Lewis interned at [[Thomas Keller]]'s [[The French Laundry]] restaurant, where Keller developed the [[confit byaldi]], a dish used in the film. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the Paris-inspired music for the film.\n\n''Ratatouille'' premiered on June 22, 2007, at the [[Dolby Theatre|Kodak Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with its general release on June 29, in the United States. The film grossed $623.7 million, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2007]] and the year\u2019s second highest-grossing animated film (behind ''[[Shrek the Third]]'') and received widespread critical acclaim for its screenplay, animation, humor, voice acting, and Michael Giacchino's score. It also won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for several more, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. ''Ratatouille'' was later voted one of the 100 greatest motion pictures of the 21st century by a [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|2016 poll of international critics]] conducted by the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=December 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nRemy, a young [[rat]] with a perfect sense of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his deceased idol, Auguste Gusteau. The rest of his colony, including his brother \u00c9mile and his father, the clan leader Django, are interested in food only for sustenance. The rats live in an elderly woman's attic outside [[Paris]]; when Remy and \u00c9mile accidentally reveal this to the woman, the clan is forced to evacuate, and Remy becomes separated from the others. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau's restaurant. \n\nRemy notices the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's former [[sous-chef]] and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini and uphold Gusteau's motto, \"Anyone can cook\". After demanding Linguini either replicate the soup or lose his job, Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Once they're alone, Linguini discovers that Remy can understand him, and he convinces Remy to help him cook.\n\nRemy guides Linguini's movements like a [[marionette]] by pulling on his hair while hiding under his [[toque]]. They recreate the soup and continue cooking at the restaurant. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini, but comes to appreciate someone heeding her advice. Linguini tries to show Remy to Colette, but Remy makes him kiss her instead. Remy reunites with \u00c9mile and the clan; Django tries to convince Remy it is impossible to change humans' disdain for rats, but Remy asserts that \"change is nature\".\n\nSkinner discovers that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son, and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner hides the proofs, but Remy finds them and is chased by Skinner. Remy outruns him and shows the documents to Linguini, who then forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular; Linguini's life improves and he develops a romantic relationship with Colette.\n\nFood critic Anton Ego, whose negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau's death, announces he will dine at the restaurant. When Linguini takes credit for Remy's cooking, he and Remy fall out. Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries for food. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, furiously drives all of the rats out, Remy included.\n\nThe next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but promptly freed by Django and \u00c9mile. Linguini reconciles with Remy and reveals the truth to his staff, who all quit. Reminded of Gusteau's motto, Colette returns to help. Django and the clan cook under Remy's direction while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, but get locked in the pantry. Remy creates a [[Confit byaldi|variation]] of [[ratatouille]] which reminds the astounded Ego of his mother's cooking. Asking to meet the chef, he is asked to wait until the restaurant is empty. Ego is stunned upon being introduced to Remy. The next day, he writes a review stating that he has come to understand Gusteau's motto, and describes Remy \u2014 without revealing that he is a rat \u2014 as \"nothing less than the finest chef in France.\"\n\nAfter Skinner and the health inspector are released, the restaurant is shut down, stripping Ego of his job and credibility. To continue Gusteau's legacy, Remy, Linguini and Colette open a [[bistro]], ''La Ratatouille'', which a now-happier Ego invests in and frequently visits. The rat colony settles into the bistro's attic as their new home.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- This section is meant to contain introductions only. It is not meant to include major plot elements.

He also wrote a buddy theme for both Remy and Linguini that plays when they are together. In addition to the score, Giacchino wrote the main theme song, \"Le Festin\", about Remy and his dream to be a chef.

Later, in one of several [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]], Evelyn encounters a [[Teppanyaki|''teppanyaki'']] chef named Chad ([[Harry Shum Jr.]]) who is indeed being puppeteered by the anthropomorphic Raccacoonie (voiced by [[Randy Newman]]) much like Remy and Linguini; during the film's climactic montage, Evelyn helps Chad rescue Raccacoonie from [[Animal control service|Animal Control]].
