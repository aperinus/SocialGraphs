Written by [[Scott Z. Burns]], the film stars [[Matt Damon]] as the titular informant named [[Mark Whitacre]], as well as [[Scott Bakula]], [[Joel McHale]] and [[Melanie Lynskey]]. It depicts Whitacre's involvement as a [[whistle blower|whistleblower]] in the [[lysine price-fixing conspiracy]] of the mid-1990s, based on the 2000 [[nonfiction]] book ''[[The Informant (book)|The Informant]]'', by journalist [[Kurt Eichenwald]].<ref name=\"Webber\">{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Susan |title=Tale of the Tapes |work=The Daily Deal |publisher=Aurora Advisors |date=25 September 2000 |url=http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |access-date=2 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006125306/http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |archive-date=6 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nReleased on September 18, 2009, ''The Informant!'' received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for Matt Damon's performance and the film's comedic yet ironic tone, although the latter has also been a point of criticism from other critics.

In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members.<ref name=\"Cain-behind\"/> In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.\n\nAuthorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre\u2019s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the [[white-collar crime|white-collar criminals]] he helped to catch.<ref name=\"Cain-behind\"/> In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential [[pardon]]. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Whitacre is eventually released from prison, with Ginger waiting to greet him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Mark Whitacre]], ''[[Archer Daniels Midland]]'' executive\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as FBI Special Agent Brian Shepard\n* [[Joel McHale]] as FBI Special Agent Robert Herndon\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Ginger Whitacre\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Robin Mann\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as FBI Special Agent Kate Medford\n* [[Thomas F.
