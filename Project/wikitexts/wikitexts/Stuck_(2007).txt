The film premiered on May 21, 2007 at the [[Cannes Film Market]]. It was later adapted in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Accident on Hill Road]]'' starring [[Celina Jaitley]] in Mena Suvari's role. It was the final film Gordon directed before his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo ([[Stephen Rea]]) is having a particularly bad day; not only has his unemployment run out, but he has also been evicted from his apartment. Retirement-home caregiver Brandi Boski ([[Mena Suvari]]) is potentially up for a promotion at work, and celebrates with a night of drinking and [[MDMA]] before driving home. On the way home, Brandi hits Tom with her car and he becomes trapped in her car's windshield. Afraid of being arrested, Brandi continues to [[Hit and run (vehicular)|drive]] home with the promise that she will get Tom help. But as she begins to debate the issue, Brandi feels the accident will destroy her life and opts to take a [[taxicab|taxi]] to work, leaving him to die slowly in her garage. When Tom realizes that, he painfully tries to escape.\n\nBrandi enlists the help of her boyfriend, Rashid ([[Russell Hornsby]]), in an attempt to kill and dispose of Tom. Meanwhile, Tom is able to pull himself free from the windshield, but before he is able to escape the garage, Rashid and Brandi restrain him. They go back into Brandi's house and decide to kill Tom, and hide the evidence by [[Cremation|burning]] both Tom's corpse and the car.\n\nRashid returns to the garage, and prepares to shoot the apparently unconscious Tom with a revolver. But Tom, secretly awake, manages to attack Rashid before stabbing him through the eye with a concealed pen, killing him. During the brawl, a shot is discharged from the gun, prompting Brandi to investigate. Tom tries to start the car, but Brandi enters the garage before he is able to do so. Tom knocks Brandi over and limps out of the garage towards the street, taking Rashid's gun with him.\n\nBrandi pursues Tom, wielding a hammer from the garage. Tom pleads with Brandi to stay back, not wanting to fire on her, but she subdues him with the hammer. She drags Tom back to the garage and begins dousing the room with gasoline, panicking. She hopes that the police will conclude that Tom broke in, attacked Rashid and accidentally became engulfed in flames while trying to burn the garage down. However, Tom is able to sneak back into the car, start it and drive forwards, pinning Brandi against the back of the garage.\n\nBrandi begs for help, while Tom steps out of the car and lights a match. He asks why she didn't help him, and Brandi says she doesn't know, and continues to plead for her life. Tom decides to spare Brandi and extinguishes the match. Brandi suddenly produces Rashid's revolver and fires on Tom, who ducks beside the car and a stray bullet ignites the gasoline, setting Brandi alight. As she screams in pain, burning to death, Tom struggles to the front of the garage and is able to open the door. Tom stumbles out onto the driveway and collapses as neighbors surround him, alerted by the fire. Tom is helped away and turns to look back at the burning garage, where Brandi's screaming has subsided, as she has been burnt alive and suffered the consequences of her actions.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Brandi Boski\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo\n* [[Russell Hornsby]] as Rashid\n* [[Rukiya Bernard]] as Tanya\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Petersen\n* [[Lionel Mark Smith]] as Sam\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Mr. Binckley\n* [[R.D.

Holden wrote \"''Stuck'', while not strictly a horror film, is steeped in gore and carries a seam of mocking gallows humor as relentless as that of ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.\" Holden said the film \"is exceptional because its characters feel like real people plunged into a disorienting situation in which they behave like monsters.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/movies/30stuc.html |title=Sorry, Your Body's in My Windshield |accessdate=2008-05-30 |author=Stephen Holden |date=2008-05-30 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Ken Fox of ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and called the film \"a drum-tight, extremely grisly thriller.

She hit Biggs, while driving impaired, and he became lodged in her windshield after the collision. She drove home, parked her car in the garage with Biggs still lodged, alive and conscious, in the windshield. While she ''did'' go out to apologize to Biggs, she failed to call for any assistance and left him to bleed to death. Mallard and two accomplices then took the body to a local park, where it was discovered. She was arrested four months later after bragging about the incident at a party. The Fort Worth Medical Examiner and other experts all testified at the trial that basic first responder care would have saved Biggs' life.\n\nThe film attracted some criticism for [[whitewashing in film|whitewashing]]. White actor Mena Suvari, in [[cornrows]], plays a character based on Chante Jawan Mallard, who is of [[African American]] descent.<ref>{{cite news | last=Fisher | first=Luchina | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=4991235 | title=Is Hollywood Whitewashing Ethnic Roles? | work=[[ABC News]] | date=2008-06-04 | accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[2007 in film]]\n* ''[[Creepshow 2]]'', a 1987 movie with a scene, ''[[Creepshow 2#The Hitch-hiker|The Hitch-hiker]]'', in which a similar vehicular homicide was portrayed where the zombie-like victim followed the driver all the way back to her garage\n* A significant plotline in season 2 of the television series ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' surrounds the death of a character after becoming embedded in the windshield of a car during a hit-and-run accident\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{mojo title|title=Stuck}}\n* {{IMDb title|0758786}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Stuck}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|stuck|Stuck}}\n\n{{Stuart Gordon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stuck (2007 Film)}}\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2007 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:Canadian survival films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about road accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stuart Gordon]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Brunswick]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
