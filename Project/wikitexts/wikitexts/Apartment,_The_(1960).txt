A. L. Diamond]]. It stars [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Ray Walston]], [[Jack Kruschen]], [[David Lewis (American actor)|David Lewis]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[David White (actor)|David White]], [[Hope Holiday]] and [[Edie Adams]].\n\nThe film follows an [[insurance]] clerk (Lemmon) who, in the hope of climbing the corporate ladder, lets more senior coworkers use his [[Upper West Side]] apartment to conduct extramarital affairs. He is attracted to an [[elevator operator]] (MacLaine) in his office building, unaware that she is having an affair with his immediate boss (MacMurray).\n\n''The Apartment'' was distributed by [[United Artists]] to widespread critical acclaim and was a commercial success, despite controversy owing to its subject matter. It became the [[1960 in film|8th highest grossing film of 1960]]. At the [[33rd Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for ten awards, and won five, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. Lemmon, MacLaine and Kruschen were Oscar-nominated. Lemmon and MacLaine won [[Golden Globe Award]]s for their performances. It provided the basis for ''[[Promises, Promises (musical)|Promises, Promises]]'', a 1968 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] by [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Hal David]] and [[Neil Simon]].\n\nEver since its release, ''The Apartment'' has come to be regarded as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]], appearing in lists by the [[American Film Institute]] and ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine. In 1994, it was one of the 25 films selected for inclusion to the [[United States Library of Congress]] [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=1994-11-15|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|access-date=2020-05-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 1950's, C.C. \"Bud\" Baxter is a lonely office drudge at an insurance corporation in New York City. To climb the corporate ladder, he allows four company managers to take turns regularly borrowing his [[Upper West Side]] apartment for their extramarital liaisons. Baxter meticulously juggles the \"booking\" schedule, but the steady stream of women in and out convinces his neighbors that he is a playboy, bringing home someone else every night.\n\nBaxter solicits glowing performance reviews from the four managers and submits them to personnel director Jeff Sheldrake, who then promises to promote him\u2014but Sheldrake also demands use of the apartment for his own affairs, beginning that night. As compensation for this short notice, he gives Baxter two theater tickets for that evening. Bud asks his secret crush, Fran Kubelik, an [[elevator operator]] in the office building, to join him. She agrees, but first meets up with a \"former fling\", who turns out to be Sheldrake. When Sheldrake dissuades her from breaking up with him, promising to divorce his wife, they head to Baxter\u2019s apartment, as Baxter waits, stood-up, outside the theater.\n\nLater, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary, Miss Olsen, tells Fran that her boss has had affairs with other female employees, including herself. Later, at Baxter\u2019s apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake. He claims he loves her, but then heads back to his suburban family as usual.\n\nHaving realized that Fran is the woman Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment, Baxter lets himself be picked up by a married lady at a local bar. However, when they arrive at his apartment, he discovers Fran, passed out on his bed from an apparent suicidal overdose of his sleeping pills. He sends away the woman from the bar and enlists Dr. Dreyfuss, a medical doctor living in the next-door apartment, to revive Fran. Baxter intentionally makes Dreyfuss believe that he was the cause of the incident. Dreyfuss scolds Baxter for his apparent philandering and advises him to \"be a ''[[mensch]]''.\"\n\nWhile Fran spends two days recuperating in the apartment, Baxter takes cares of her, and a bond develops between them, especially after he confesses to his own suicide attempt over unrequited feelings for a woman who now sends him a fruitcake every Christmas. During a game of [[gin rummy]], Fran says she has always suffered bad luck in her love life. She falls asleep before they can finish the game. As Baxter prepares a romantic dinner, one of the managers arrives for a tryst. Baxter persuades him and his companion to leave, but the manager recognizes Fran and informs his colleagues. Later confronted by Fran's brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka, who is looking for her, the jealous managers direct Karl to Baxter\u2019s apartment. There, Baxter deflects the brother's-in-law anger over Fran's wayward behavior by once again assuming all responsibility. Karl punches him, and Fran kisses Baxter for protecting her.\n\nWhen Sheldrake learns that Miss Olsen tipped off Fran about his affairs, he fires her, but she retaliates by spilling all to Sheldrake's wife, who promptly throws her husband out. Sheldrake believes that this situation just makes it easier to pursue his affair with Fran. Having promoted Baxter to an even higher position, which also gives him a key to the executive washroom, Sheldrake expects Baxter to loan out his apartment yet again. Baxter gives him back the washroom key instead, proclaiming that he has decided to become a ''mensch'', and quits the firm. He decides to move out of the apartment and begins to pack his belongings.\n\nThat night at a [[New Year's Eve]] party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about Baxter quitting. Realizing she loves Baxter, Fran abandons Sheldrake and runs to the apartment. At the door, she hears an apparent gunshot. Fearing that Baxter has attempted suicide again, she frantically pounds on the door. Baxter opens the door with a bottle of champagne in his hand, having just popped the cork. As the two settle down to resume their unfinished game of gin rummy, Fran tells Baxter that she is on her own, like he is. When he asks about Sheldrake, she replies, \"We'll send him a fruitcake every Christmas,\u201d prompting him to declare his love for her. She happily hands him the cards and affectionately tells him to \"Shut up and deal\".\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Image:The apartment trailer 1.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Calvin Clifford \"Bud\" Baxter ([[Jack Lemmon]]) and Fran Kubelik ([[Shirley MacLaine]]), in a still from the film's final scene: \"Shut up and deal.\"]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Calvin Clifford (C.C.) \"Bud\" Baxter\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Fran Kubelik\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Jeff D.

''The Apartment'' marked his second collaboration with [[Billy Wilder]] after ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.]]\nImmediately following the success of ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', Wilder and Diamond wished to make another film with Lemmon. Wilder had originally planned to cast [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] as Sheldrake; however, after he died unexpectedly, MacMurray was cast.\n\nThe initial concept came from ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' by [[No\u00ebl Coward]], in which Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meets Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) for a thwarted tryst in his friend's apartment. However, due to the [[Hays Production Code]], Wilder was unable to make a film about adultery in the 1940s. Wilder and Diamond also based the film partially on a Hollywood scandal in which high-powered agent [[Jennings Lang]] was shot by producer [[Walter Wanger]] for having an affair with Wanger's wife, actress [[Joan Bennett]]. During the affair, Lang used a low-level employee's apartment.<ref>Billy Wilder Interviews: [[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]</ref> Another element of the plot was based on the experience of one of Diamond's friends, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to find that she had committed suicide in his bed.\n\nAlthough Wilder generally required his actors to adhere exactly to the script, he allowed Lemmon to improvise in two scenes: In one scene, he squirts a bottle of nasal spray across the room, and in another, he sings while cooking spaghetti (which he strains through the grid of a tennis racket). In another scene, where Lemmon was supposed to mime being punched, he failed to move correctly, and was accidentally knocked down. Wilder chose to use the shot of the genuine punch in the film. Lemmon also caught a cold when one scene on a park bench was filmed in sub-zero weather.\n\nArt director [[Alexandre Trauner]] used [[forced perspective]] to create the set of a large insurance company office. The set appeared to be a very long room full of desks and workers; however, successively smaller people and desks were placed to the back of the room, ending up with children. He designed the set of Baxter's apartment to appear smaller and shabbier than the spacious apartments that usually appeared in films of the day. He used items from thrift stores and even some of Wilder's own furniture for the set.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Chandler, Charlotte.

According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the ''American Beauty'' DVD, the film's director, [[Sam Mendes]], had watched ''The Apartment'' (among other classic American films) as inspiration in preparation for shooting his film.\n\nWithin a few years after ''The Apartment'''s release, the routine use of [[black-and-white]] film in Hollywood ended. Since ''The Apartment'' only two black-and-white movies have won the Academy Award for Best Picture: ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) <!-- which includes a few seconds of color, so the wording \"filmed entirely in B&W\" would be wrong --> and ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' (2011).\n\nIn 1994, ''The Apartment'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].
