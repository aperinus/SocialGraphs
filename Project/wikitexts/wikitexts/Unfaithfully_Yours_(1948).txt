The film is about a jealous symphony conductor who imagines three different ways to deal with the supposed infidelity of his beautiful wife\u2014murder, forbearance, and a suicidal game of Russian roulette\u2014during a concert of three inspiring pieces of classical music. At home, his attempts to bring any of his fantasies to life swiftly devolve into farce\u2014underscored with humorous adaptations of the relevant music. In the end, the truth comes out, and love triumphs. Although the film, which was the first of two Sturges made for [[Twentieth Century-Fox]], received mostly positive reviews, it was not successful at the box office.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\n==Plot==\nSir Alfred de Carter is a world-famous symphony conductor who returns from a visit to his native England and discovers that his rich and boring brother-in-law, August Henshler, has misunderstood Alfred's casual instruction to watch over his much younger wife Daphne while he was away, having hired a detective named Sweeney to follow her. Alfred is livid, and ineptly attempts to destroy any evidence of the detective's report.\n\nEventually, despite his efforts, he learns the content of the report directly from Sweeney: while he was gone, his wife was spied late at night going to the hotel room of Alfred's secretary, Anthony Windborn, a man closer in age to her own, where she stayed for thirty-eight minutes.\n\nDistressed by the news, Alfred quarrels with Daphne before proceeding to his concert, where he conducts three distinct pieces of classical music, envisioning revenge scenarios appropriate to each one: a complicated \"perfect crime\" scenario in which he murders his wife and frames Windborn (to the Overture to [[Rossini]]'s ''[[Semiramide]]''), nobly accepting the situation and giving Daphne a generous check and his blessing (to the Prelude to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]''), and a game of Russian roulette with a blubbering Windborn, that ends in de Carter's suicide (to [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Tchaikovsky)|Francesca da Rimini]]''.)\n\nAfter the concert, Alfred tries to stage his fantasy of murdering his wife, but is thwarted by his own ineptness, making a mess of their apartment in the process. After Daphne returns home, he realizes that she really loves him, and\u2014without revealing his suspicions\u2014he learns that she is innocent of Sweeney's charges. She had gone to Windborn's room in search of her sister, Barbara, August's wife, who ''was'' having an affair with Windborn; she became trapped there when she saw Sweeney spying on the room.  Alfred begs Daphne's forgiveness for his irrational behavior, which she gladly gives, ascribing it to the creative temperament of a great artist.<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94454&category=Full%20Synopsis Full synopsis]</ref><ref name=amg>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:51839~T0 Plot synopsis (Allmovie)]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Barbara Lawrence-Rudy Vallee in Unfaithfully Yours.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Film still|Publicity still]] with Barbara Lawrence and Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]\n*[[Rex Harrison]] as Sir Alfred de Carter\n*[[Linda Darnell]] as Daphne de Carter\n*[[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]] as August Henshler\n*[[Barbara Lawrence]] as Barbara Henshler\n*[[Kurt Kreuger]] as Anthony Windborn\n*[[Lionel Stander]] as Hugo Standoff\n*[[Edgar Kennedy]] as Detective Sweeney\n*[[Al Bridge]] as House Detective\n*[[Julius Tannen]] as O'Brien\n*[[Torben Meyer]] as Dr. Schultz\n*[[Georgia Caine]] as Dowager (uncredited)\n*[[Robert Greig (actor)|Robert Greig]] as Jules, the Valet (uncredited)\n*[[Max Wagner]] as Stage Manager (uncredited)\n\n==Music==\nEach of Alfred's three fantasy revenge scenarios is accompanied by music appropriate for the mood of the particular scene, which is underscored throughout. Rex Harrison is shown rehearsing and directing real musicians from known orchestras.\n\n* Overture to the opera ''[[Semiramide]]'' by [[Gioacchino Rossini]], about a [[femme fatale]] as Alfred envisages his wife to be.\n* Overture to the opera ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user und der S\u00e4ngerkrieg auf Wartburg]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]], about renunciation of carnal love for a higher and more spiritual goal, as Alfred sees himself in that situation.\n* The [[tone poem]] ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Tchaikovsky)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' by [[Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky]],<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94454&category=Music Music]</ref> referring to the infernal destiny awaiting an adulterous wife, such as [[Dante]]'s character.\n\n==Production==\n[[Preston Sturges]] wrote the original screen story for ''Unfaithfully Yours'' in 1932 &ndash; the idea came to him when a melancholy song on the radio influenced him while working on writing a comic scene.  Sturges shopped the script to [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] who all rejected it during the 1930s.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94454&category=Notes Notes]</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Sturges envisioned [[Ronald Colman]] playing de Carter, and later initially wanted Frances Ramsden &ndash; who was introduced in Sturges' 1947 film ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'' &ndash; to play Daphne; but by the time casting for the film began, he wanted [[James Mason]] for the conductor and [[Gene Tierney]] for his wife.<ref name=tcmnotes /> [[Jimmy Conlin]], one of Sturges' regular actors, played the role of Daphne's father, but the character was cut before the film was released.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nStudio attorneys were worried about the similarity between Sturges' character Sir Alfred de Carter, a famous English conductor, and the real-life famous English conductor Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]; they warned Sturges to tone down the parallels, but the similarity was noted in some reviews anyway.<ref name=tcmnotes /> (Beecham's grandfather was [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]], a chemist who invented [[Beecham's Pills]], a laxative.  It is speculated that Sturges named his character de Carter after [[Carter's Little Liver Pills]].)<ref>{{IMDb title|0040919}}</ref>\n\n''Unfaithfully Yours'', which had the working titles of \"Unfinished Symphony\" and \"The Symphony Story\", went into production on February 18, 1948, and wrapped in mid April of that year.<ref name=tcmover>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=94454&category=Overview Overview]</ref>  By 28 June the film had already been sneak-previewed, with a runtime of 127 minutes, but the film's release was delayed to avoid any backlash from the suicide of actress [[Carole Landis]] in July.  It was rumored that Landis and Rex Harrison had been having an affair, and that she committed suicide when Harrison refused to get a divorce and marry her.  Harrison discovered Landis' body in her home.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on November 5, 1948, and went into general release on December 10.  The Los Angeles premiere was on December 14.<ref name=tcmover />\n\nIn February 1949, after the film was released, William D. Shapiro, who claimed to be an independent film producer, sued Fox and Sturges with a claim that the story of the film was [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] from an unproduced screen story by [[Arthur Hoerl]], which Shapiro had been intending to produce.  The connection was supposedly composer Werner Heymann, who frequently worked with Sturges and whom Shapiro had interviewed to be the music director on his film.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\n==Reception==\nWhile rich with the sharp dialogue that became Sturges' trademark, the film was not a box office success. Critics usually attribute this to the darkness of the subject matter, especially for a comedy.  The idea of a bungling murderer did not sit well with 1948 audiences, and the fact that none of the characters is especially sympathetic certainly did not help.\n\nIn 2008, director Quentin Tarantino placed the film at number 8 in his top 11 movies of all time.\n\nSturges, whose previous film ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'' had been pulled from distribution shortly after being released, never fully recovered from the lukewarm reception given to ''Unfaithfully Yours'', and many{{who|date=August 2022}} point to it as the movie which effectively ended his career.  Despite this, it is considered today by many critics{{who|date=August 2022}} to be an outstanding film.<ref name=amg />\n\n==Home media==\n[[The Criterion Collection|The Criterion Company]] released a DVD of the film, featuring additional audio commentary by Sturges scholars James Harvey, Diane Jacobs, and Brian Henderson. Sturges's fourth (and last) wife \"Sandy\" also provides commentary about Sturges and the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/films/876 |title=Unfaithfully Yours (1948) |work=The Criterion Collection |first=Jonathan |last=Lethem |date=July 11, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nTwentieth Century-Fox remade the film in 1984 under [[Unfaithfully Yours (1984 film)|the same title]], with [[Dudley Moore]], [[Nastassja Kinski]], [[Armand Assante]] and [[Albert Brooks]] and directed by [[Howard Zieff]].<ref name=tcmnotes /> The remake, however, eliminated the theme of three different pieces of music inspiring three different response or revenge scenarios.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0040919}}\n*{{tcmdb title|94454}}\n*{{Amg movie|51839}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/772-unfaithfully-yours-zeno-achilles-and-sir-alfred ''Unfaithfully Yours: Zeno, Achilles, and Sir Alfred''] an essay by [[Jonathan Lethem]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Preston Sturges}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1948 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1940s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films about classical music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Preston Sturges]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Preston Sturges]]\n[[Category:Uxoricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:1948 drama films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
