The screenplay by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] is based on the 1944 [[novella]] of [[Gigi (novella)|the same name]] by [[Colette]]. The film features songs with lyrics by Lerner and music by [[Frederick Loewe]], arranged and conducted by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]]. Costume design by [[Cecil Beaton]] (hats by {{Interlanguage link multi|Paulette (milliner)|fr|3=Paulette (modiste)|lt=Madame Paulette|vertical-align=sup}}).\n\nAt the [[31st Academy Awards]], the film won all nine of its nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Minnelli. It held the record for the highest clean sweep of nominations until ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' won all eleven of its nominations at the [[76th Academy Awards]] in 2004.\n\nIn 1991, ''Gigi'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=U.S. FILM REGISTRY ADDS 25 'SIGNIFICANT' MOVIES|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html|access-date=2020-10-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] ranked it number 35 in ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]]''. The film is considered the last great [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] musical and the final great achievement of the Freed Unit, headed by producer [[Arthur Freed]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set during the [[Belle \u00c9poque]] at the turn of the 20th century. While in [[Bois de Boulogne]], Honor\u00e9 Lachaille remarks that in Paris, marriage is not the sole option for wealthy young ''bon vivants'' like his nephew Gaston, who is bored with life. Gaston does enjoy spending time with Madame Alvarez and her granddaughter, the precocious, carefree Gilberte, affectionately known as Gigi. Gigi's mother (a singer who is heard but never seen onscreen) leaves her care mostly to Madame Alvarez.\n\nFollowing the \"family tradition\", Madame Alvarez regularly sends Gigi to her sister, Alicia (Gigi's great-aunt) to be groomed as a [[courtesan]], which is a more dignified euphemism for a wealthy man's mistress. She learns proper etiquette and charm, but Gigi disdains the trivial love between a man and his mistress. She prefers having fun with Gaston, whom she regards as an older brother.\n\nLike his uncle, Gaston is a known wealthy womanizer in Parisian high society. When his latest mistress has an affair with her ice skating instructor, Gaston publicly humiliates her, resulting in her faux-attempted suicide. Gaston plans to retreat to the country, but his uncle insists he remain in Paris and attend even more parties.\n\nWhile playing cards with Gaston, Gigi wagers that if he loses, he must take her and her grandmother to the seaside for the weekend. Gaston agrees, loses the bet, and the three travel to [[Trouville-sur-Mer|Trouville]]. While Gaston and Gigi have fun together, Honor\u00e9 and Madame Alvarez unexpectedly reunite and reminisce about their once-passionate affair. As other women at the resort hold perfect poise with an air of boredom or disdain for anything unfamiliar, Gigi pulls Gaston out of his depressive rut with her carefree attitude.\n\nWhen Gaston goes to Monte Carlo, great-aunt Alicia and Madame Alvarez scheme to turn Gigi into Gaston's mistress. Though initially dubious, Madame Alvarez agrees to Gigi being intensively trained before Gaston's return. Gigi accepts this as pre-destined.\n\nWhen Gaston returns, he is discomfited when Gigi shows off her new womanly gown. Gaston insults the dress, preferring her juvenile outfits; Gigi mocks his taste in clothes. Offended, Gaston storms out, then quickly realizes his folly and returns to apologize. He offers to take Gigi to tea at the Reservoir, but Madame Alvarez interjects, telling Gaston that an unchaperoned Gigi being seen in public with him could damage her reputation.\n\nAngered, Gaston storms out again. He walks and reflects on Gigi, realizing he has developed a romantic desire for her. Although hesitant due to her young age, Gaston realizes that he loves Gigi. He wishes only to be near her\u2014an unheard-of behavior between a man and his mistress. Despite such conventions, he proposes a generous \"business arrangement\" to Madame Alvarez and Aunt Alicia for Gigi to become his mistress. The women are overjoyed by his offer, though Gigi is not.\n\nGigi refuses, telling Gaston she does not seek celebrity status only to eventually be abandoned by him and become another man's mistress. She wants their relationship to remain platonic, but when Gaston suddenly reveals that he loves her, Gigi bursts into tears. She chastises him, saying if he truly loved her, he would never expose her to a mistress's uncertain life. Gaston leaves dejected and is angry at Madame Alvarez, claiming she only emphasized the proposition's sordidness. He then speaks with Honor\u00e9, who says that Gigi's family has always been rather odd. Gigi later sends for Gaston and tells him that she would rather be miserable with him than without him, and agrees to the arrangement. When Gaston arrives for their first social outing, he is unexpectedly entranced by the transformed Gigi's elegant beauty.\n\nThe couple go to [[Maxim's]] restaurant. Gigi performs perfectly as his courtesan, which only upsets Gaston. After presenting her with an expensive diamond bracelet, he grows uneasy with the unrelenting scrutiny being heaped on them. Honor\u00e9 delivers a crushing blow when he congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and remarks that Gigi is so delightful that she will likely keep him amused for months.\n\nGaston, too in love with Gigi to subject her to an appalling life of uncertainty and social judgment, brusquely insists they leave. He drags Gigi up the stairs and into her grandmother's apartment. Sobbing hysterically, Gigi asks what she did wrong. Gaston leaves without answering, but realizing the depth of his love, soon returns. He asks Madame Alvarez for Gigi's hand in marriage. Gigi is overjoyed, as is her grandmother. \n                    \nThe final sequence returns to Honor\u00e9 Lachaille, who proudly points out Gaston and Gigi getting into a carriage in the [[Bois de Boulogne]]: elegant, beautiful, and happily married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as Gilberte \"Gigi\"\n* [[Maurice Chevalier]] as Honor\u00e9 Lachaille\n* [[Louis Jourdan]] as Gaston Lachaille\n* [[Hermione Gingold]] as Madame Alvarez (\"Mamita\")\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Liane d'Exelmans\n* [[Jacques Bergerac]] as Sandomir\n* [[Isabel Jeans]] as Aunt Alicia\n* [[John Abbott (actor, born 1905)|John Abbott]] as Manuel\n* [[Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Arnaud]] as a Maxim's girl<ref>{{harvnb|Fordin|1996|p=539}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nHollywood producer [[Arthur Freed]] first proposed a musicalization of the [[Colette]] novella to [[Alan Jay Lerner]] during the [[Philadelphia]] tryout of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in 1954. When Lerner arrived in Hollywood two years later, Freed was battling the [[Hays Code]] to bring his tale of a courtesan-in-training to the screen. Another roadblock to the project was the fact Colette's widower had sold the rights to her novella to [[Gilbert Miller]], who planned to produce a film version of the 1954 stage adaptation by [[Anita Loos]]. It cost Freed more than $87,000 to purchase the rights from Miller and Loos.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|pp=147\u201348}}</ref>\n\nLerner's songwriting partner Frederick Loewe had expressed no interest in working in Hollywood, so Lerner agreed to write the screenplay only. He and Freed discussed casting; Lerner favored [[Audrey Hepburn]], who had starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production written by Loos, but Freed preferred \nMGM contract star [[Leslie Caron]], who had co-starred in ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'' for him. Both agreed [[Maurice Chevalier]] would be ideal for aging boulevardier Honor\u00e9 Lachaille, and Lerner proposed [[Dirk Bogarde]] for Gaston. Lerner agreed to write the lyrics if Freed could convince Bogarde and designer [[Cecil Beaton]] to join the project. He decided to approach Loewe once again, and when he suggested they compose the score in Paris, Loewe agreed.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|p=149}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1957, the duo began working in Paris. When Chevalier, who already had agreed to appear in the film, first heard \"[[Thank Heaven for Little Girls]]\", he was delighted. When he discussed his waning interest in wine and women in favor of performing for an audience in [[cabaret]]s, Chevalier inadvertently inspired the creation of another tune for his character, \"I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore\". The lyrics for another of his songs, the duet \"I Remember It Well\", performed with [[Hermione Gingold]] as his former love Madame Alvarez, were adapted from words Lerner had written for ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', a 1948 collaboration with [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|pp=151\u201352}}</ref> \"Say a Prayer for Me Tonight\", a solo performed by Gigi, had been written for [[Eliza Doolittle]] in ''My Fair Lady'' but was removed during the pre-Broadway run. Lerner disliked the melody, but Loewe, Freed, and Minnelli voted to include it in the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|p=159}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Gigi'58.jpg|right|thumb|Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan]]\nLerner recalls that for the film ''Gigi'', \"The casting was so haphazard, I don't know how they ever got it on.\" He wrote the part of Honor\u00e9 Lachaille for Chevalier, but the rest of the casting was still undecided.<ref>{{Cite news|title = \"Love is the exception to every rule, if it not?\": The films of Vincente Minnelli & Alan Jay Lerner|last = Siegel|first = Joel E.|date = 1980|newspaper = [[Bright Lights Film Journal]]|page = 8|issue = 1|volume = 3}}</ref> Having second thoughts about Audrey Hepburn, Freed asked Lerner to meet with her in Paris, but she declined the role. The producer then asked him to fly to London to speak to Leslie Caron, who was living there with her husband [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. Lerner was surprised to discover the star had become [[Anglicization|anglicized]] to the point of losing her French accent. She had recently starred in an unsuccessful stage production of ''Gigi'', but when she heard Lerner's interpretation of the story greatly differed from that of the play, she accepted his offer. Her singing voice was dubbed by [[Betty Wand]], though Caron filmed mainly to her own tracks (a brief clip of Caron's voice is heard in the DVD extras). Dirk Bogarde expressed interest, as well, but ultimately was unable to free himself from his contract with [[J. Arthur Rank]]. Recalling [[Louis Jourdan]] from his performance in ''[[Three Coins in the Fountain (1954 film)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]'', Freed offered him the role of Gaston.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|pp=152\u201355}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nIn late April, Freed and Minnelli and their entourages arrived in Paris. The weather had become unseasonably hot, and working in hotel rooms without air-conditioning was uncomfortable. Minnelli began scouting locations while Freed and Lerner discussed the still incomplete script. Lerner had taken liberties with Colette's novella; the character of Honor\u00e9, nonexistent in the original book and very minor in the Loos play, was now a major figure. Gigi's mother, originally a significant character, was reduced to a few lines of dialogue delivered off-screen. Lerner also expanded the focus on Gigi's relationship with her grandmother.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|p=154}}</ref>\n\nA signature scene was filmed on location at Maxim's, the famous Belle Epoque restaurant with its ornate Art Nouveau mirrored walls. Shooting at the restaurant was a logistical nightmare, as the mirrors reflected lighting equipment, the camera, and other undesirable behind-the-scenes artifacts. Minelli and cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg worked together to come up with careful camera placements and a low-light visual scheme so that the location could be used without covering up the iconic mirrors. Ruttenberg even managed to cut down on the need for lighting stands and securing lights in corners by attaching lights with suction cups.<ref>{{cite book |last=Steinhart |first=Daniel |year=2019 |title=Runaway Hollywood: Internationalizing Postwar Production and Location Shooting |location=Berkeley |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |page=164 |isbn=978-0-5202-9864-4}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-July, the composers had completed most of the score, but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled he jumped up, \"[his] trousers still clinging to [his] ankles, and made his way to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for ''Gigi''.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Alan Jay |year=1978 |title=The Street Where I Live |location=New York |publisher=[[W. W. Norton & Company]] |pages=161\u201362 |isbn=0-393-07532-X}}</ref>\n\nIn September, the cast and crew flew to California, where several interior scenes were filmed, among them the entire scene in Maxim's, which included a musical number by Jourdan. Lerner was unhappy with the look of the scene as it had been shot by Minnelli, so, at considerable expense, the restaurant was recreated on a [[soundstage]] and the scene was reshot by director [[Charles Walters]], since Minnelli was overseas working on a new project.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|pp=161\u201362}}</ref>\n\nThe [[film title design]] uses the artwork of [[Sem (artist)|Sem]]'s work from the ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]''.\n\n=== Musical numbers ===\n# [[Overture]] \u2013 Played by MGM Studio Orchestra\n# \"Honor\u00e9's [[Soliloquy]]\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier\n# \"[[Thank Heaven for Little Girls]]\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier\n# \"It's a Bore\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier, Louis Jourdan and John Abbott\n# \"The Parisians\" \u2013 Sung by Betty Wand\n# \"The Gossips\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier and MGM Studio Chorus\n# \"She is Not Thinking of Me\" \u2013 Sung by Louis Jourdan\n# \"The Night They Invented Champagne\" \u2013 Sung by Betty Wand, Hermione Gingold and Louis Jourdan\n# \"I Remember It Well\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold\n# \"Gaston's Soliloquy\" \u2013 Sung by Louis Jourdan\n# \"[[Gigi (song)|Gigi]]\" \u2013 Sung by Louis Jourdan\n# \"I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier\n# \"Say a Prayer for Me Tonight\" \u2013 Sung by Betty Wand\n# \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls (Reprise)\" \u2013 Sung by Maurice Chevalier and MGM Studio Chorus\n\nThe principal credited orchestrator was [[Conrad Salinger]] with vocal arrangements supervised by Robert Tucker.\n\n==Release==\nFollowing completion of the film, it was previewed in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. Audience reaction was overwhelmingly favorable, but Lerner and Loewe were dissatisfied with the result. Lerner felt it was twenty minutes too long and most of the action too slow. The changes he proposed would cost an additional $300,000, money Freed was loath to spend. The songwriting team offered to buy 10% of the film for $300,000, then offered $3 million for the print. Impressed with their belief in the film, MGM executives agreed to the changes, which included eleven days of considerable reshooting, putting the project at $400,000 over budget. At a preview in [[Encino, California|Encino]], audience reaction changed from \"appreciation to affection\", and Lerner felt the film finally was ready for release. It premiered at the [[Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre|Royale Theatre]], a legitimate theatrical venue in New York City, on May 15, 1958.<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1996|pp=163\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe film entered saturation release in the United States with 450 prints on April 1, 1959.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety214-1959-03#page/n156/mode/1up|title=450 Prints of 'Gigi'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 18, 1959|page=5|access-date=June 23, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $6.5 million in the US and Canada and $3.2 million elsewhere during its initial theatrical release, resulting in a profit of $1,983,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\">{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}</ref> It was Freed's last and largest grossing success.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 19, 2004|last=Collins|first=Keith|title=Reeling in the years|page=30}}</ref>\n\nIn total, the film grossed $13,208,725 in its initial release and later 1966 re-release.<ref>{{harvnb|Fordin|1996|p=495}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nIn the 1959 review for ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', David Vaughan calls ''Gigi'' \"an elegant film\" with a \"cultivated visual taste [which] is everywhere apparent\". He summarizes that \"while ''Gigi'' does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday, it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size.\" He praises Minnelli's talent for \"the delicious amorality of the anecdote, but also the honesty and irony of its telling [which] have become foreign to the American cinema.\" Vaughan points out \"Chevalier's practiced but irresistible charm [as] one of the film's greatest assets\" as well as \"the brilliant high-comedy playing of Isabel Jeans, who as Aunt Alicia consummately portrays the distinction and beauty of a retired aristocrat of the ''demimonde''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Gigi|date = Spring 1959|magazine = [[Sight & Sound]]|pages =90\u201391|volume = 28|issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' that the authors may want to sue themselves\". He added, \"But don't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film, for ''Gigi'' is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs. It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette, but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story's flavored mood and atmosphere ... Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that, for quality and harmony, are superb.\"<ref>{{cite web|last = Crowther|first = Bosley|url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00EFDC173DE53BBC4E52DFB3668383649EDE|title = ''New York Times'' review|publisher = Movies.nytimes.com|date = May 16, 1958|access-date = March 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Abel Green]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"100% escapist fare\" and predicted it \"is destined for a global box-office mop-up\". He added, \"Alan Jay Lerner's [[libretto]] is tailor-made for an inspired casting job for all principals, and Fritz Loewe's tunes (to Lerner's lyrics) already vie with and suggest their memorable ''My Fair Lady'' score... Miss Caron is completely captivating and convincing in the title role... Skillful casting, performance and presentation have endowed realism to the sum total... Director Minnelli's good taste in keeping it in bounds and the general sound judgment of all concerned...distinguishes this Arthur Freed independent production. The Metrocolor rates recognition for its soft pastels under Joseph Ruttenberg's lensing; the Beaton costumes, sets and general production design are vivid physical assets at first sight. The skillful integration of words-and-music with the plot motivation makes this ''Gigi'' a very fair lady indeed as a boxoffice entry.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gigi|url = https://variety.com/1958/film/reviews/gigi-2-1200419205/|website = Variety|access-date = February 17, 2016|language = en-US|first = Abel|last = Green|date = May 21, 1958}}</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'' said, \"The dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton ... The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much\u2014it's like a meal consisting of cheesecake, and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down. No doubt inspired by the finicky, claustrophobic sets and bric-\u00e0-brac, the cast tries (with unfortunate success) to be more French than the French, especially Chevalier. The exception is Gingold, who inhabits, as always, a world of her own.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/70189/Gigi.html |title=''Time Out New York'' review |publisher=Timeout.com |date=May 12, 2009 |access-date=March 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113134928/http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/70189/Gigi.html |archive-date=January 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film 3\u00bd out of five stars, calling it \"Overbaked but enjoyable, and a banquet for the eyes, thanks to the visual wonder of the Minnelli-Beaton teaming...

Perhaps if the sweetness of ''Gigi'' was contrasted with elements of honest vulgarity, the picture could balance itself out... Ten minutes into the movie, you've resolved the plot and are left to wallow in lovely frou-frou.
