Alexander, her manager, sees a heroic forest ranger named Jefferson on the television news, saying he has lost his cabin in a fire and wishes he could get a home-cooked Christmas dinner. Alexander arranges for Elizabeth to do a special live show on Christmas, where she will cook a Christmas dinner for Jefferson. In reality, Elizabeth can't cook and trying to keep Jefferson and the viewing public from finding out may be a little difficult, especially on a live show.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dyan Cannon]] as Elizabeth Blane\n*[[Kris Kristofferson]] as Jefferson Jones\n*[[Tony Curtis]] as Alexander Yardley\n*[[Richard Roundtree]] as Prescott\n*Kelly Cinnante as Josie\n*[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Man in Chair in Front of Media Truck ''(uncredited cameo)''\n\n==Reception==\nJohn Ferguson of ''[[Radio Times]]'' awarded the film two stars out of five.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ferguson|first=John|title=Christmas in Connecticut|magazine=[[Radio Times]]|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/fyg5d4/christmas-in-connecticut/|access-date=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n* [[List of American films of 1992]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0103961}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|christmas_in_connecticut_1991}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=1989|title=Christmas in Connecticut (1992)}}\n* {{Amg movie|9564|Christmas in Connecticut (1992)}}\n\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:1992 television films]]\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s Christmas comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Christmas television films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Fox]]\n[[Category:Films set in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:TNT Network original films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{Christmas-tv-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
