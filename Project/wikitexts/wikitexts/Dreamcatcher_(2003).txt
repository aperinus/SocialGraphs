As children, they all acquired [[telepathy|telepathic powers]] which they call \"the line\" after saving a boy with disabilities named Douglas \"Duddits\" Cavell from bullies and befriending him.\n\nOne night, Jonesy sees Duddits beckoning him to cross the street, but as he does so, Jonesy is hit by a car. His injuries heal with mysterious speed, and six months later, he is able to make it for the group's annual trip. Jonesy rescues a man lost in the forest named Rick McCarthy. He is very ill, so Jonesy and Beaver let him rest and recover inside their cabin. Suddenly, all the forest animals\u2014predator and prey both\u2014run past their cabin in the same direction, followed by two military helicopters that announce the area is now quarantined. Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick sits dead, covered in blood. A three-foot long worm-like creature writhes and screams in the toilet. Beaver sits atop the toilet lid to trap the creature, but the creature breaks out and kills him. Jonesy tries to escape, but is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Gray, who [[Spirit possession|possesses]] Jonesy's body.\n\nNearby, Henry and Pete crash their SUV to avoid running over a frostbitten woman from Rick's original hunting party. Henry walks for help while Pete stays with the woman. She dies and also excretes a worm, which Pete barely manages to kill. Mr. Gray tricks and kidnaps Pete, but Jonesy telepathically warns Henry to stay hidden. Henry returns to the cabin to find Beaver dead and the worm that killed him laying a group of eggs. To kill all of the alien larvae, he sets fire to the cabin.\n\nMeanwhile, an elite military unit specializing in extraterrestrials, led by the unhinged Colonel Abraham Curtis, seeks to contain everyone exposed to the aliens. Col. Curtis is planning to retire after this operation and will pass command, along with a pearl-handled stainless-steel .45 pistol, to Captain Owen Underhill, his trusted friend and second-in-command. The two lead an air-strike into a large forest clearing where the aliens' spaceship has crash-landed. The aliens use telepathy to ask for mercy, but the helicopters massacre most of the aliens with mini-guns and missiles. The alien ship self-destructs, destroying the remaining aliens and two helicopters.\n\nJonesy retraces his memories of the area while watching Mr. Gray use his body. Mr. Gray tries to coerce Pete into cooperating but eats him when he refuses. Jonesy realizes that Mr. Gray possessed him, not by chance, but to access memories of Duddits, which he needs. Henry arrives at the fenced-in quarantine camp only to realize that Col. Curtis plans to kill all of those quarantined. Henry convinces Underhill to prevent this by going over Curtis' head and having him relieved.\n\nHenry and Underhill break out of the camp and head to Duddits' home. Duddits, who is dying of leukemia, informs them Mr. Gray is headed for the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] to seed the water with alien larvae. Curtis, realizing the danger looming to the entire planet, leaves the camp in his armed helicopter and tracks down Henry, Underhill, and Duddits, attacking them at the reservoir. Underhill is mortally wounded and dies shortly after he shoots Curtis down.\n\nIn the reservoir's pump house, Henry manages to stop Mr. Gray's plan, but struggles to bring himself to kill Jonesy, unable to tell if he is possessed. Unknown to him, an alien larva hatches and begins crawling toward the water. Duddits confronts Mr. Gray, who finally exits Jonesy's body. The two struggle as Duddits reveals himself to also be an alien of a different race. Both aliens explode in a cloud of red-dust which briefly resembles a [[dreamcatcher]]. Jonesy, now himself again, steps on the final alien larva before it can contaminate the reservoir.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Henry Devlin\n** Mikey Holekamp as Young Henry Devlin\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as Gary \"Jonesy\" Jones / Mr. Gray\n** Giacomo Baessato as Young Gary \"Jonesy\" Jones\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Pete Moore\n** Joel Palmer as Young Pete Moore\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Joe \"Beaver\" Clarendon\n** [[Reece Thompson]] as Young Joe \"Beaver\" Clarendon\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Douglas \"Duddits\" Cavell\n** Andrew Robb / Tyler Myer as Young Douglas \"Duddits\" Cavell\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Colonel Abraham Curtis\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Lieutenant Owen Underhill\n* [[Eric Keenleyside]] as Rick McCarthy \n* [[Rosemary Dunsmore]] as Roberta Cavell \n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Lieutenant General Matheson \n* Darrin Klimek as Maples\n* [[Campbell Lane]] as Old Man Gosselin\n* [[C.

I've been personally wounded by other movies, where I'd written it, and thought, 'Oh, God, the world's not interested in what I'm interested in.' With ''Dreamcatcher'', the career was hurt.
