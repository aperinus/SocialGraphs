Set in 1949, it is a fictionalized account of the group of real-life LAPD officers and detectives, called the [[Gangster Squad (LAPD)|Gangster Squad]], who brought down crime kingpin [[Mickey Cohen]] and his gang.\n\nAfter the script spent several years on the [[Black List (survey)|Black List]], production began in September 2011 around Los Angeles, lasting through December. The film was originally set to be theatrically released September 7, 2012, but in the wake of the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado, shooting]], [[Warner Bros.]] pushed it back to a January 11, 2013, release to accommodate re-shoots, which took place in August 2012.\n\nIt received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and production values but criticized the thinly-written characters. It grossed $105 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1949 [[Los Angeles]], crime boss [[Mickey Cohen]] has become the most powerful figure in the California criminal underworld and intends to expand [[Cohen crime family|his criminal enterprise]] to encompass the entire [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] has not been able to stop his ruthless rise, as he has eliminated witnesses, hired dirty cops to protect his activities, and avoided prosecution through corruption in the justice system.\n\nDetermined to put a stop to Cohen, LAPD Chief [[William H. Parker (police officer)|Bill Parker]] creates a secret police unit tasked with dismantling Cohen's enterprise. The unit, composed of officers who do not carry badges and are authorized to act outside of the law, are led by the skilled [[World War II]] [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] veteran Sergeant John O'Mara. With the help of his wife, Connie, he recruits Detective Jerry Wooters and four incorruptible misfit officers: knife-wielding Lieutenant Coleman Harris, [[wire tapping]] expert and family man Conwell Keeler, outlaw sharpshooter Max Kennard, and Kennard's rookie prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Navidad Ramirez.\n\nDespite initial setbacks, such as a casino raid thwarted by corrupt [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] police officers, the Squad strikes several successful blows at the heart of Cohen's operations, including shutting down his lucrative wire gambling business. They break into Cohen's mansion and Keeler plants a [[covert listening device|bug]] in the back of a television. As a result, Cohen believes someone has betrayed him and lashes out at those around him, including his etiquette tutor Grace Faraday. Wooters and Faraday have entered into a secret romantic relationship, and he tries to help her escape from Cohen, enlisting the help of mutual friend and gangster Jack Whalen.\n\nRealizing the attackers have never stolen his money, Cohen deduces they are cops and realizes that they have bugged his house. He uses it to lure the Squad into an unsuccessful ambush in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] while Keeler is executed by a hitman. When Faraday witnesses Cohen murder Whalen, she agrees to testify against her former employer. O'Mara forces the crooked Judge Carter to sign an arrest warrant before leading the Squad to the [[Park Plaza Hotel (Los Angeles)|Park Plaza Hotel]] to arrest Cohen.\n\nCohen and his men engage in a lengthy shootout with the Squad, during which Wooters and Kennard are wounded. Cohen and his bodyguard Karl Lennox escape, but O'Mara rams their vehicle into a fountain. Navidad helps a dying Kennard shoot Lennox, saving O'Mara. Cohen and O'Mara fight each other in a brutal bareknuckle brawl while onlookers and journalists gather. O'Mara finally beats Cohen and has him arrested, ending his reign over Los Angeles.\n\nThe film explains that the Gangster Squad has never been mentioned for its role in keeping the Mafia from gaining a foothold in L.A., and that its surviving members remain secret. Cohen is sentenced to life imprisonment at [[Alcatraz]], and is greeted with a lead-pipe beating by inmates who were friends of Whalen. Wooters and Faraday continue their relationship, and O'Mara quits his job with the LAPD to live a quiet life with his wife and newborn son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Sergeant John O'Mara, a World War II veteran-turned-cop with a reputation as an honest, hardworking, no-nonsense man.

In reality, Cohen largely sidelined Dragna as head of the Los Angeles crime family but otherwise left him alone; Dragna died of a heart attack in 1956.\n* The film shows Cohen's primary business as gambling, with prostitution and drug dealing as sidelines. In reality, Cohen's main racket was bookmaking; he detested drugs.\n* [[William H. Parker (police officer)|William Parker]] was only 45 in 1949, not in his 70s like Nick Nolte (Parker died at age 61 in 1966). He also did not create the Gangster Squad; it was created by Chief [[Clemence B. Horrall]] in 1946, and was largely an effort to improve the city's image, regardless of whether it actually pursued criminals.\n* The film concludes with Cohen being arrested in 1949 for murder and sent to [[Alcatraz]]. In reality, he was imprisoned in 1951 and again in 1961 for [[tax evasion]]. He was, however, attacked with a lead pipe while in prison, as the film states.\n* While Anthony Mackie and Michael Pe\u00f1a are members of the film's Squad, the real Squad was entirely white.\n* While it is possible Cohen murdered [[Jack Whalen]] in real life, it was not at Whalen's home as depicted in the film. Whalen was shot in 1959 while at dinner with Cohen and three of his associates, and Cohen was not officially accused of it.\n* Cohen's bodyguard [[Johnny Stompanato]] was not shot as depicted in the film, but lived until 1958, when he was stabbed by [[Cheryl Crane]], the daughter of his girlfriend [[Lana Turner]].\n* The character of Max Kennard was based on real life lawman Doug \"Jumbo\" Kennard, who was killed in a 1952 drunk car crash after he had retired, not shot in the line of duty as in the film.\n* In the film, Conwell Keeler is the first member of the Squad to be killed. In real life, he outlived all of the Squad's other members, dying of a stroke in 2012.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|www.gangstersquadmovie.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|1321870}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|gangster_squad_2012}}\n* {{mojo title|gangstersquad}}\n* {{IMFDB title|Gangster Squad}}\n\n{{Ruben Fleischer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gangster Squad}}\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s police films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about Jewish-American organized crime]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ruben Fleischer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Dan Lin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Steve Jablonsky]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1949]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Will Beall]]\n[[Category:Village Roadshow Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Advertising and marketing controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Political controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Film controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
