The film is a sequel to ''[[Species II]]'' (1998) and the third installment of the [[Species (film series)|''Species'' series]]. Directed by [[Brad Turner (director)|Brad Turner]] and stars [[Robin Dunne]], [[Robert Knepper]], [[Sunny Mabrey]], [[Amelia Cooke]] and [[John Paul Pitoc]]. [[Natasha Henstridge]], who was contracted to a trilogy commencing with [[Species (film)|the first ''Species'' film]], briefly reprises the role of Eve in the opening scene.\n\nThe film premiered on the American channel [[Syfy]] on November 27, 2004, and released on [[DVD]] on December 7, in both a standard and an [[Motion picture content rating system|unrated version]]. The film was shot in [[high-definition video|HD video]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Species II|Hours after the events of the previous film]], the [[ambulance]] transporting the lifeless Eve has lost its way, but when the co-driver tries to radio their superiors, the driver, Dr. Bruce Abbot, stops and holds him at gunpoint. They are ambushed by Portus, who kills the co-driver with his tongue. Abbot discovers both Portus and Eve in the back of the ambulance; Portus strangles Eve to death while she gives birth to a newborn alien, which Abbot flees with. Government agent Wasach orders an autopsy, discovering Eve's pregnancy, then has her body burned.\n\nAbbot returns to his usual job teaching [[biochemistry]] at a university, where he teaches his belief that it is wrong to decide whether a species should live or die. He raises Eve's child in his home and she grows into a young girl who he names Sara. One night at Abbot's office, he is visited by Portus, who has dramatically aged and is critically ill. While Abbot tries to treat him, Portus demands to see \"it\" (Eve's child) and reveals to Abbot that there are other half-breeds suffering from similar illnesses. Afterward, he dies horribly while sitting in the chair. Shocked by these events, Abbot approaches Dean, one of his students whose funding for an experimental power plant project is in jeopardy and asks for his aid in perfecting the alien DNA to save the species. In return, Abbot promises Dean a share of any funding or awards their work receives.\n\nIn Abbot's absence, Sara pupates inside a cocoon and emerges as an adult. Abbot's superior, Dr. Nicholas Turner, arrives at the house seeking Abbot and comes across Sara, who initially tries to seduce him but then rejects him. He attempts to rape her and Sara kills him. Sara leaves to seek a mate and Abbot returns home, and sees evidence of Sara's transformation and disposes of Turner's body. Sara eventually connects with another half-breed, but discovers his illnesses and knocks his tooth out. As Abbot and Dean continue their experiments on Sara, Dean begins to bond with her. Abbot informs Dean of the government's \"Project Athena\", which created Sil in the [[Species (film)|first film]] and Sara's heritage as the child of Patrick Ross infected with alien DNA from Mars and Eve, Sil's clone. The half-breed that Sara rejected breaks into the lab, mortally wounds Abbot and attempts to impregnate Sara, but is killed by hydrochloric gas Abbot sprays over the lab. Left alone, Dean ponders whether to continue Abbot's work, and Sara urges him to save her species.\n\nDean's roommate at the university, Hastings, discovers a website posted by a woman named Amelia who wants to date biochemists. After snooping through Dean's notes, he forwards them to Amelia, who agrees to meet him. En route, Amelia - who is another half-breed - has sex with and murders a gas station attendant who attempts to rape her. At the campus, she senses Sara and kidnaps Hastings, taking him to Abbot's home. Both Amelia and Sara force Hastings to work on perfecting the alien DNA using Sara's purer biology to save the half-breeds and create perfect mating partners for them. Agent Wasach, whose team also monitored Amelia's website and discovered its connection to Project Athena, picks up Dean and helps him save Hastings.\n\nDean, Hastings, and Wasach flee to Dean's experimental power plant with Sara and Amelia in pursuit. While attempting to keep Sara's harvested eggs away from them, the three decide to try trapping Amelia and Sara in the plant's core, but this tactic risks causing a catastrophic meltdown. Dean drops the eggs into the core, prompting Amelia to attempt to kill him, but Sara attacks her and throws her into the core as well. Dean, Hastings, and Wasach manage to close the core in time to prevent a meltdown.\n\nLater, Hastings visits Dean at Abbot's home and discovers both Sara and a half-breed alien boy. Dean reveals that he actually managed to pull Sara to safety before sealing the plant's core, then completed the refined alien DNA to create a mate for her so she would not be alone. After the boy is grown, Dean tells Sara she is on her own and to be careful, but before Sara and her mate leave, Dean asks Sara why she saved him from Amelia when there was no reason to. She does not answer; however, it is implied that she has come to care for him. Dean then reassures the nervous Hastings by revealing that he had ensured that Sara's mate would be sterile, preventing them from reproducing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Dunne]] as Dean\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as Dr. Bruce Abbot\n* [[Sunny Mabrey]] as Sara\n**  Savanna Fields as Young Sara\n* [[Amelia Cooke]] as Amelia\n* [[John Paul Pitoc]] as Hastings\n* [[Michael Warren (actor)|Michael Warren]] as Agent Wasach\n* [[Christopher Neame]] as Dr. Nicholas Turner\n* [[Patricia Bethune]] as Colleen\n* [[Joel Stoffer]] as Portus\n** Christopher R.

They decided to cast Sunny Mabrey as the main blonde alien. Amelia Cooke was also taken for the role. Also, Mancuso wanted the creatures to look slightly different from [[H.R. Giger]]'s original concept. The alien species was then redesigned by Rob Hinderstien.\n\n==Reception==\n''Species III'' received mostly negative reviews, holding a 33% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on six reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Species III - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/species_iii/|work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> ''[[DVD Talk]]'' negatively reviewed the film saying \"this film is underdeveloped with an absurd plot and bad special effects, this film just reuses old ideas and is not worth your time, it is a pointless sequel that lacks an effective story to make it a watchable film, it is just camouflaged by nudity\".<ref>{{cite web|title=DVDTalk|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/18429/species-trilogy/|access-date=May 4, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Den of Geek!]]'' said: \"If you are going to start watching this franchise, you should give this one a miss and cut straight to [[Species - The Awakening|the final film]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Revisiting Species: Species III|date=6 August 2009 |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14710/revisiting-species-species-iii|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nA fourth film, ''[[Species \u2013 The Awakening|Species: The Awakening]]'', was released straight-to-television in 2007. While it does continue the ''[[Species (film series)|Species'' series]]'', it was a standalone film, not a direct follow-up to ''Species III''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0410650}}\n\n{{Species Films}}\n{{Brad Turner}}\n\n[[Category:2000s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Brad Turner]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Species (film series)]]\n[[Category:Films about rape]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Syfy original films]]\n[[Category:2000s monster movies]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elia Cm\u00edral]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:American horror television films]]\n[[Category:American pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1998]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
