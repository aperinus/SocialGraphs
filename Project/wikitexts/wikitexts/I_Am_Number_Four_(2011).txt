J. Caruso]] and starring [[Alex Pettyfer]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Dianna Agron]], and [[Callan McAuliffe]]. The screenplay, by [[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]], and [[Marti Noxon]], is based on the 2010 [[I Am Number Four|novel of the same name]], one of the ''[[Lorien Legacies]]'' [[young adult fiction|young adult]] science fiction novels. The film follows a teenage alien on Earth fleeing other aliens who are hunting him down.\n\nProduced by [[Michael Bay]], ''I Am Number Four'' was the first film production from [[DreamWorks Pictures]] to be released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], as part of the studio's 2009 distribution deal with [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].<ref name=thr-dream>{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title='I Am Number Four' Likely to Rank No. 1 at Box Office This Weekend|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/i-am-number-four-rank-101217|access-date=May 28, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' estimated the budget to be between $50 million and $60 million. The film was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theatres on February 18, 2011, received generally negative reviews, and grossed $150 million.<ref name=\"pbt\" />\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Smith is an alien from the planet Lorien. He was sent to Earth as a child with eight others, collectively called the Garde, to escape the invading Mogadorians, who destroyed Lorien. John is protected by a guardian (who are known as C\u00eapan), Henri, and has developed powers, including enhanced strength, speed and agility.\n\nThe Mogadorians, led by Commander Setrakus Ra, learn about the nine children and travel to Earth. The Garde can only be killed in sequence; Number One through Number Nine. Three of them are already dead, with John being Number Four. Knowing this, he and Henri move from a beachside bungalow in Florida to an old farm in Paradise, Ohio, where John befriends conspiracy theorist Sam Goode and a [[Beagle]] which he names [[Bernie Kosar]]. He also falls for an amateur photographer, Sarah Hart. Her ex-boyfriend, football player Mark James, is a bully who torments both John and Sam.\n\nDuring the Spring Scream Festival, Mark and his friends chase Sarah and John into the woods. When they attack, John uses his powers to fend them off and rescue Sarah. Sam witnesses this, which leads John to reveal his true origins. The next day, Mark's father, the local sheriff, interrogates Henri on John's whereabouts when his son and his friends were attacked. Henri tells John that too many people are suspicious and they have to leave. John refuses because of Sarah.\n\nThe Mogadorians continue searching for John, while being trailed by Number Six, who is also trying to locate Number Four. Number Six's guardian was killed, and she realizes that the remaining six Garde will have to team up and fight against the Mogadorians.\n\nThe Mogadorians locate John and manipulate two conspiracy theorists into capturing Henri. When John and Sam go to rescue Henri, they have to fend off an attack by the Mogadorians. Henri dies, while John and Sam escape with some Lorien artefacts, including a blue rock that acts as a tracking device for other Garde. Sam's father, a conspiracy theorist who disappeared while hunting aliens in Mexico, had another of the rocks. While Sam searches for it, John tries to say goodbye to Sarah at a party, only to discover that the Mogadorians have framed him and Henri for the murders of the conspiracy theorists. Mark sees John and calls his father, who corners John and Sarah. John saves Sarah from a fall, revealing his powers, and they escape to their school.\n\nSetrakus Ra arrives in Paradise, with a convoy of trucks. He is confronted by Mark and his father, and after injuring the sheriff, he forces Mark to show him where John is hiding, which Mark has deduced is the school.\n\nJohn, Sarah, and Sam are attacked by the Mogadorians, who brought two Piken to hunt the trio. They are saved by Number Six and Bernie, who is actually a shapeshifting [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] sent by John's biological parents to protect him. John and Number Six, who can turn invisible and can block energy attacks, continue to fight the Mogadorians. They eventually defeat them all, including Setrakus Ra.\n\nThe following day, John and Number Six unite their blue rocks and discover the location of the other four surviving Garde. John lets Sam come with them in hopes of finding Sam's father. They set off to find the others so they can protect Earth from the Mogadorians, leaving Sarah and a repentant Mark, who lies to his father about John's whereabouts. Mark also returns a magic box left to John by his Dad, that was in police evidence. John thanks Mark and promises Sarah that he will come back to her. While they share a goodbye kiss, Mark is visibly resigned to their relationship. John, Sam, Bernie and Number Six drive off, vowing to protect Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Alex Pettyfer]] as Daniel/John Smith/[[I Am Number Four#Characters#John Smith/Number Four|Number Four]]\n* [[Dianna Agron]] as [[I Am Number Four#Characters#Sarah Hart|Sarah Hart]]\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as [[I Am Number Four#Characters#Number Six|Number Six]]\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Henri\n* [[Callan McAuliffe]] as [[I Am Number Four#Characters#Sam Goode|Sam Goode]]\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Setrakus Ra, the Mogadorian Commander  \n* [[Jake Abel]] as [[I Am Number Four#Characters#Mark James|Mark James]]\n* Jeff Hochendoner as Sheriff James \n* Greg Townley as Number Three\n* [[Reuben Langdon]] as Number Three's Guardian\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as Mrs. Hart\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Frank\n* Charles Carroll as Mr. Goode\n* [[Ken Beck]] as Jackson\n* [[Tucker Albrizzi]] as Tuck\n* [[Emily Wickersham]] as Nicole\n* Patrick Sebes as Kevin\n* Andy Owen as Bret\n* L.
