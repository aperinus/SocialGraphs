The film stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Didier Bourdon]], [[Abbie Cornish]], [[Tom Hollander]], [[Freddie Highmore]] and [[Albert Finney]]. The film is loosely based on the [[A Good Year (novel)|2004 novel of the same name]] by British author [[Peter Mayle]]. The film was theatrically released on 9 September 2006 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film grossed over $42.2 million against its $35 million budget. The film received nominations for the [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics Choice Award]] for Best Young Actor and the [[Satellite Award]] for Best Cinematography. ''A Good Year'' was released on DVD on 27 February 2007 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nYoung Max Skinner, whose parents died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things at his Uncle Henry's [[vineyard]] estate in [[Provence]] in southeastern [[France]]. Twenty-five years later, Max is a successful but arrogant [[workaholic]] [[Trader (finance)|trader]] in [[London]] with a cheeky-chappy persona.\n\nFollowing his uncle's death, Max is the sole [[beneficiary]] of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving, by driving while fumbling with a cell phone, he unknowingly causes a local caf\u00e9 owner, Fanny Chenal, to crash her bicycle. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and he is ordered to return to London as soon as possible.\n\nTo assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny, driving by and spotting his rental car, turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.\n\nOn Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless.\n\nThey are surprised by the arrival of young [[Napa Valley]] [[oenophile]] Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Max realizes, but does not tell her, that French law decrees that even though she is not his uncle's legitimate daughter, she still becomes the rightful heir to the Chateau and vineyards. \n\nAs Max did earlier, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu (\"the lost corner\") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics. During dinner at the Duflot house, while slightly inebriated, Max exposes his concern that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her.\n\nMax's assistant Gemma warns him of the ambitious antics of other employees. To ensure he is not usurped by Kenny, his second-in-command in [[London]], through whom Max continues to direct trades, he intentionally gives the ambitious young trader bad advice, getting him fired.\n\nMax becomes enamoured with Fanny, who is rumoured to have sworn off men. He successfully woos her into his bed. She leaves him the next morning, expecting him to return to his life in London. A disillusioned Christie also decides to move on. Max finds his uncle's memoirs, which contain proof of her heritage. \n\nMax bids her farewell while handing her an unexplained note inside a book she was reading. While informing Duflot of the pending estate sale, Max learns that the mysterious expensive Le Coin Perdu was made by Henry and Duflot with \"illegal vines\" from the estate, bypassing [[wine classification]] and [[appellation]] laws.\n\nThe estate is sold and Max returns to London where Sir Nigel, the company chairman, offers him a choice: either a large discharge settlement, or the partnership in the trading firm. Max asks about Nigel's art in the conference room, van Gogh's \"[[Road with Cypress and Star]]\", which Fanny has a copy of in her restaurant. Upon Nigel's dismissive comment that the real one is kept in a vault and the $200,000 copy in the office is for show, Max reconsiders if he wants to still be like Nigel.\n\nMax invalidates the estate's sale with the farewell letter he gave to Christie, which he forged, along with real photos confirming Christie as Henry's daughter with a valid claim to the entire estate. (As a child Max signed checks for his uncle, and is able to replicate his handwriting.)\n\nHe puts his London residence up for sale and returns to Provence, entering into a relationship with Fanny, both of them remembering their connection as kids. Christie also returns and she and Francis jointly run the vineyard while trying to reconcile their vastly different philosophies of wine production. This enables Max to focus his entire attention on Fanny.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Max Skinner\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Uncle Henry\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Fanny Chenal\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Christie Roberts\n* [[Didier Bourdon]] as Francis Duflot\n* [[Isabelle Candelier]] as Ludivine Duflot\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Young Max Skinner\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Charlie Willis\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as Kenny\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Amis\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Gemma\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Sir Nigel\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Bert, the doorman\n* [[Valeria Bruni Tedeschi]] as notaire Nathalie Auzet\n* [[Giannina Facio]] as Maitre D'\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n{{Quote box|width=30em|quote=\"As I go on, I'm very attracted to comedy.

Scott Free president Lisa Ellzey recommended the works of author [[Peter Mayle]], who had written best-selling books set in the south of France. Scott and Mayle were acquaintances and neighbours, having worked together in advertising and commercials during the 1970s, but as the author did not want to write a screenplay, he instead wrote a new book after discussing a film plot with Scott. \u201cRidley arrived with a newspaper clipping which reported on new wines in Bordeaux \u2013 \u2018garage\u2019 wines \u2013 which commanded huge prices without a chateau or pedigree. Yet, people paid a fortune for them\u201d,Mayle said. \u201cI saw this piece in the newspaper business section of the Times about a vineyard in France that was selling garage wine for over \u00a330,000 a case,\u201d Scott recounted about the 1996 clipping, which he still keeps in his files in London. \u201cI was looking for an excuse to come back to France to shoot a film, and this story idea offered the perfect opportunity. I bounced this idea off Peter Mayle and he said, \u2018That would make a good novel\u2019. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You write the book, then I\u2019ll get the film rights.\u2019 So, he wrote the book.\u201d<ref name=\"notes\">{{Cite web |date=2 August 2014 |title=A Good Year (2006) {{!}} Production Notes |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2006/agoodyear.htm |website=Made in Atlantis |access-date=26 September 2022 |archive-date=13 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220913053200/http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2006/agoodyear.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Screenwriter Marc Klein was brought in after Scott read an adaptation he did of ''[[The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing]]'' \u2013 eventually released in 2007 as ''[[Suburban Girl]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/news/year-on-scott-s-calendar-1117900760/ |title='Year' on Scott's calendar |first=Dana |last=Harris |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=25 February 2004 |access-date=17 June 2014 |archive-date=6 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006013708/http://variety.com/2004/film/news/year-on-scott-s-calendar-1117900760/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nKlein had to expand and alter the story of the book to make the adaptation \"more movie-like\". A particular focus was to add conflict, with changes such as turning Fanny from a gentle character to a stubborn woman who starts without sympathy for Max. Another addition was the scene where Max falls in the swimming pool, which Scott said was to demonstrate \"[that] the house had not let him go\". The director wanted to portray Uncle Henry on screen instead of just describing him. While writer Marc Klein first suggested depicting him as a ghost, Scott's attempts at that did not work so he used [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] which \"occur just as another scene\" where it would depict \"the grooming of Max as child which will be used as payoffs for the three acts that follow\".<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nKlein described Henry as \"sounding like Albert Finney\" so Scott hired the actor, with whom he had worked in ''[[The Duellists]]''.<ref name=post>{{cite video|title=Postcards from Provence|location=''A Good Year'' DVD|year=2007}}</ref> Scott brought [[Russell Crowe]] as the protagonist Max. The actor stated that it was a good opportunity for them to reunite after 2000's ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' as \"it just seemed more fun to go into this smaller place, where the problems weren't as vast.\" The character was considered a change from Crowe's usual roles, with some noting it may reflect \"maturity\" or \"contentment\", with Australia's ''Courier-Mail'' dubbing him \"A Mellow Fellow\". Crowe said of his life at the time: \"[I'm] relaxed ... Work isn't the most important thing in my life now. It's not even in the top ten.\" The actor also stressed the importance of his family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lovefilm.com/features/detail.html?section_name=newsletter&editorial_id=3139 |title=DVD and Blu-ray rental |website=Lovefilm |access-date=17 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219223500/http://www.lovefilm.com/features/detail.html?section_name=newsletter&editorial_id=3139 |archive-date=19 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Scott also stated one of the reasons for the project was that he had \"not done much in the way of comedy\" and it seemed to be a good opportunity to \"keep challenging yourself\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://ew.com/article/2006/06/23/russell-crowe-and-ridley-scott-extended-qa/ | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | first=Josh | last=Rottenberg | title=Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott: An extended Q&A | date=23 June 2006 | access-date=16 September 2018 | archive-date=16 September 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916235510/https://ew.com/article/2006/06/23/russell-crowe-and-ridley-scott-extended-qa/ | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Abbie Cornish]] did a videotaped audition for Ridley Scott only weeks before filming started.<ref name=\"notes\"/> [[Eva Green]] and [[Vahina Giocante]] auditioned for the role of Fanny Chenal, which later went to [[Marion Cotillard]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Grasset |first=Alain |date=23 August 2005 |title=Marion Cotillard va jouer au c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Russell Crowe |trans-title=Marion Cotillard will play alongside Russell Crowe |url=https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/marion-cotillard-va-jouer-au-cote-de-russell-crowe-23-08-2005-2006230321.php |website=[[Le Parisien]] |language=fr |access-date=26 September 2022 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103053417/https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/marion-cotillard-va-jouer-au-cote-de-russell-crowe-23-08-2005-2006230321.php |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot throughout nine weeks in 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2006/November-1-2006/DIRECTORS-CHAIR-RIDDLEY-SCOTT-A-GOOD-YEAR.aspx |first=Iain |last=Blair |title=Director's Chair - Ridley Scott: 'A Good Year' |website=Post Magazine |date=1 November 2006 |access-date=17 June 2014 |archive-date=23 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023041744/http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2006/November-1-2006/DIRECTORS-CHAIR-RIDDLEY-SCOTT-A-GOOD-YEAR.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> mostly in locations Scott described as \"eight minutes from my house\".

The one after Max had fallen was dug and concreted nearby, and the original one had its bottom replaced digitally to match. The production team could not film the [[wine cave]] from La Canorgue as they shot during the period where it was being used, so the [[wine cellar]] from a nearby hotel was turned into a cave. While southern France does not have [[clay court]]s as the weather makes them hard to maintain, Scott wanted one for its dirty and beaten up aspect, so the tennis court was built from scratch, including posts straight from the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon courts]]. Fanny's cafe was shot in a Gordes restaurant, with designer Sonja Klaus decorating it with items bought from [[second-hand shop]]s considering the character would have done the same. Klaus employed a [[kitsch]] decoration on Duflot's estate to show it was \"a character [[keeping up with the Joneses]] \u2013 if it was in America, he would drive a golden Cadillac with leopard skin print seats\", and decorated the large water basin of Cucuron with floating candles to \"make it look like a fabulous event\" for Max's dinner with Fanny.<ref name=post/>\n\n===Music===\n[[Marc Streitenfeld]] worked as a music editor on [[Hans Zimmer]]'s [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]] and was invited by Scott to make his debut as a film score composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underscores.fr/index.php/2010/03/interview-marc-streitenfeld-vo/ |first=Olivier |last=Desbrosses |title=A good year for Marc Streitenfeld |website=Underscores.fr |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=17 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326124549/http://www.underscores.fr/index.php/2010/03/interview-marc-streitenfeld-vo/ |archive-date=26 March 2014 }}</ref> The soundtrack includes \"[[Moi Lolita]]\" by [[Aliz\u00e9e]], \"Breezin' Along with the Breeze\" by [[Josephine Baker]], \"[[Gotta Get Up]]\", \"Jump into the Fire\", and \"How Can I Be Sure of You\" by [[Harry Nilsson]], \"[[Hey Joe]]\" by [[Johnny Hallyday]], \"Vous, qui passez sans me voir\" and \"J'attendrai\" by [[Jean Sablon]], \"Le chant du gardien\" by [[Tino Rossi]], \"Je chante\" by [[Charles Trenet]], \"Old Cape Cod\" by [[Patti Page]], \"Walk Right Back\" by the [[Everly Brothers]], \"[[Boum!]]\" by Adrien Chevalier, and \"Itsy Bitsy Petit Bikini\" by [[Richard Anthony (singer)|Richard Anthony]].
