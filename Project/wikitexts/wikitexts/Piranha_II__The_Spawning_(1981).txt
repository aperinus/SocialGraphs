It is written by [[Charles H. Eglee]] (under the [[pseudonym]] H.A. Milton) and stars [[Tricia O'Neil]] and [[Lance Henriksen]], who would later star in Cameron's ''[[The Terminator]]'' and [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']]. Part of the [[Piranha (film series)|''Piranha'' film series]], it is the sequel to the film ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'' (1978) directed by [[Joe Dante]].\n\nCameron, previously a special effects artist for [[Roger Corman]], was hired as director after executive producer [[Ovidio G. Assonitis]] fired his predecessor. The production was fraught with difficulties arising from Assonitis' exerting an unusual amount of creative control, hiring an Italian crew that didn't speak English and preventing Cameron from viewing any footage during the editing process. The exact degree of creative control Cameron had has been disputed by multiple sources, with some claims arising that Assonitis fired Cameron after two weeks and directed the film on his own while others maintain that Cameron was present for the entirety of principal photography.\n\nAfter the film's release, Cameron largely disowned the film for many years,<ref name=\"TerminatorFiles\" /> but has since acknowledged it as his directorial debut.<ref name=\":0\" /> A director's cut exists only on Laserdisc and VHS.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=501743|title=Piranha Part Two: The Spawning|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=6 November 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Caribbean]] coastal [[resort]], Hotel Elysium, is menaced by a series of vicious marine animal attacks originating from a nearby sunken [[shipwreck]]. Diving instructor Anne Kimbrough's student is one of the victims, but her estranged police officer husband Steve refuses to let her see the [[corpse]]. Soon after, two women and a man are killed by [[piranha]] which has developed the ability to fly.\n\nConcerned, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by tourist Tyler Sherman, and decides to take him with her to the [[morgue]] to get a look at the body. A nurse comes in and kicks them out, unaware that a piranha was hiding in the body. It kills the nurse and escapes through a window.\n\nIn her hurry, Anne left her [[credit card]] behind at the scene. Anne and Tyler have a one-night stand. In the morning she begins to study the pictures of the corpse, and is horrified by what she discovers. Steve arrives, throwing the card at her, angry that she went to the morgue and that she has a man in her bed. She tries to warn him of what she has discovered, but he ignores her.\n\nAnne then tries to cancel the diving sessions, leading to her getting fired by her manager. Attempting to capture one as proof of the incoming threat, she is intercepted by Tyler, who informs her that he is a [[biochemist]] and member of a team which has developed the ultimate weapon: a [[Biological specimen|specimen]] of [[genetically modified]] piranha, capable of flying. He explains that his team lost a [[cylinder]] full of these fish in the water earlier.\n\nGabby provides the proof Anne needs to Steve, showing him that they are a serious danger, as they are now eating each other. At a meeting, Anne tries her best to reason with the manager, to no avail. Steve provides a piranha wing as evidence. Steve tells her that she cannot trust Tyler, because the army says he is crazy.\n\nLater, a piranha attacks Gabby's son and kills him, leaving Gabby to vow revenge. Anne tries to dissuade him, but fails. Having ignored Anne's advice, the manager, Raoul, hosts a nighttime fish party to capture [[grunion]]. Unfortunately for the residents, the piranha join the hunt. Anne gets a man named Aaron to patrol the beach but he is lured to the sea where the piranha kill him. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas fly out of the water and attack the guests. Anne leads the survivors into the hotel, where they shut the doors and windows. Gabby tries to attack the flying piranha, but they easily overwhelm and kill him.\n\nIn the morning, the piranha leave as they do not like the light. Tyler and Anne decide to undertake Gabby's plan, and blow up the ship to kill the predators. Meanwhile, Anne and Steve's son Chris has been hired, against their wishes, by a local ship 'Captain' Dumont and his daughter Allison. They sail away and strand themselves on an [[island]]. They get lost at sea and try to set sail again, heading straight toward the wreck.\n\nWhen Chris and Allison are stranded in a [[raft]] above the shipwreck, Anne and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Gabby left behind. With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the [[bomb]] explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. Steve, piloting a [[police helicopter]], ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler gets stuck and is eaten by the piranhas. Anne escapes out of a [[porthole]], then grabs the [[anchor]], allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. The bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and all the piranha with it. With all the piranhas dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve, Chris, and Allison in their boat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Tricia O'Neil]] as Anne Kimbrough\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Steve Kimbrough\n* Steve Marachuk as Tyler Sherman\n* Ted Richert as Raoul\n* [[Ricky Paull Goldin|Ricky G.

[[Roger Corman]], the head of [[New World Pictures]] which had produced and released the first film, did not share either person's interest, instead focusing on his own \"underwater horror\" film ''[[Humanoids from the Deep]]''. Schechtman and van Leuwen purchased the sequel rights from Corman, first setting up an independent production company before developing a script with writers [[Charles H. Eglee]] and [[Channing Gibson]], based on a treatment by New World producer Martin B. Cohen.\n\nBecause Dante was already attached to direct [[The Howling (film)|''The Howling'']] for New World, the producers approached Dante's former colleague Miller Drake as prospective director. Drake had worked alongside Dante in New World's trailer department and had essayed the role of \"First Mutant\" in Dante's directorial debut, ''[[Hollywood Boulevard (1976 film)|Hollywood Boulevard]]''{{snd}}before becoming Corman's de facto head of post-production. With a tentative director in place, the producers' sought financing and eventually struck a deal with [[Ovidio G. Assonitis]], a Greco-Italian filmmaker who had produced and directed several successful low-budget \"cash-in\" films aimed at the American import market. Drake set to work developing a script with Eglee, who would later collaborate with [[James Cameron]] on the TV show ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]''. Drake's intention was that ''Piranha II'' should hinge upon [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]]'s scientist from Piranha, even though he had seemingly perished in the first movie.\n\n\"I pitched this idea of bringing Kevin McCarthy back, all chewed up and mutilated from the previous movie,\" says Drake. \"He was on an abandoned oil rig and he was developing these flying piranhas out there to get revenge, or whatever. I think we were going to bring [[Barbara Steele]] back and have him kill her by smashing her head through a fish tank.\"\n\nPlans changed as neither McCarthy nor Steele were available, and the script was eventually re-written as a standalone story without returning characters. [[James Cameron]], another New World alumnus, was hired as the [[special effects]] director. Some time before principal photography started, Miller Drake was fired by Assonitis and Cameron was promoted to director. ''Piranha II'' would be his feature directorial debut.\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe primary location for the film was the Mallards Beach-Hyatt Hotel (later renamed to Moon Palace Jamaica resort), in [[Ocho Rios]], [[Jamaica]], which served as the film's fictional Club Elysium resort.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5_3AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA279|title=Cinema Italiano: The Complete Guide from Classics to Cult|publisher=[[I.B.

''towson.edu''</ref>\n\nDue to budget limitations the crew was composed essentially of [[Italian people|Italians]], none of whom spoke [[English language|English]]. Some however did have prior [[experience]] on horror/fantasy movies so they were, to some extent, able to satisfy Cameron's requirements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Among the crew was veteran horror cinematographer [[Roberto D'Ettorre Piazzoli]] (whose name is misspelled \"Roberto D'Ettore Piazzoli\" in the opening credits). The special effects were designed and supervised by [[Giannetto De Rossi]], who had previously worked on [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and [[The Beyond (1981 film)|''The Beyond'']].\n\nAfter the first week of shooting, the set harmony was disturbed by some discussions about the work between the director and the producers (Assonitis, asked to verify the day-to-day activities, arguing with most of Cameron's choices), so while Cameron was only responsible for the shooting, most of the decisions were under Assonitis' authority.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAs in the first film, which was one of many horror films inspired by the success of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), [[piranha]]s act as the antagonist [[monster]]s harming [[human]] life, and have developed the ability to fly, which they did not have in the first film. On the ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' commentary track, Cameron jokingly defended the film, tongue firmly in cheek, as \"the finest flying killer fish horror/comedy ever made\". He would later employ some of the same mechanisms used to make the piranhas fly in the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]] animatronics for ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 95%; background:#F0F8FF; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"I was replaced after two-and-a-half weeks by the Italian producer.

And then the producer wouldn't take my name off the picture because [contractually] they couldn't deliver it with an Italian name. So they left me on, no matter what I did.
