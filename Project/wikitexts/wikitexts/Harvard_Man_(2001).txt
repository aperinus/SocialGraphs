When his parents' house is destroyed by a [[tornado]], Alan is desperate for $100,000 to replace their home. He is approached by his girlfriend Cindy Bandolini, whose father is an [[organized crime]] boss. Cindy convinces Alan to throw a game for the money. She tells Alan that her father is behind the deal, but actually she goes to her father's associate, Teddy Carter, and Carter's assistant, Kelly Morgan for funding. What she does not know is that Carter and Morgan are undercover FBI agents.\n\nAlan throws the game, gives his parents the money, and then undergoes a [[psychedelic experience]] after he ingests a big dose of [[LSD]], 15,000 micrograms. There follows a long stretch of the film during which morphing special effects demonstrate Alan's altered state as he is pursued by Carter, while Cindy is collared by Morgan.\n\nJust when it looks like a toss-up as to what will prove his downfall first, the [[bad trip]], the FBI, or the mob, Alan's other girlfriend (who is also his philosophy lecturer), Chesney Cort, saves the day. Not only does she get Alan to a doctor who can bring him back to sobriety, she reveals that she is in a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois|sexual threesome]] with Carter and Morgan. Once he gets some photographic evidence for blackmail, Alan is extricated from his problems.\n\nThe ending implies that he may have [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]] (a chronic disorder in which a person has flashbacks of visual hallucinations or distortions experienced during a previous hallucinogenic drug experience) this is also known as having acid (LSD) flashbacks. While taking a picture of a boy in the park the boy's face morphs and Alan hears echoes of past conversations when Sandy said \"Sometimes it never ends\". The little boy consoles Alan telling him \"everything's okay\". He responds \"I hope you're right\". A close up is shown of his eyes dilated.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Cindy Bandolini\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Alan Jensen\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Chesney Cort\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Teddy Carter\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Kelly Morgan\n* [[Gianni Russo]] as Andrew Bandolini\n* [[Ray Allen]] as Marcus Blake\n* Michael Aparo as Russell\n* Scottie Epstein as Mario\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Dr. Reese\n* [[Polly Shannon]] as Juliet\n* Phillip Jarrett as Coach Preston\n* [[Al Franken]] as himself\n\n==Release==\n''Harvard Man'' had only a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in July 2002, and received little critical or popular acclaim, although it achieved some success when it was released on [[video]] and [[DVD]] in October of that year.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
