A remake of the [[The Blob|1958 film of the same name]], it stars [[Shawnee Smith]], [[Kevin Dillon]], [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]], [[Jeffrey DeMunn]], [[Paul McCrane]], [[Art LaFleur]], [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]], [[Joe Seneca]], [[Del Close]] and [[Candy Clark]]. The plot follows an acidic, amoeba-like organism that crashes down to [[Earth]] in a military [[satellite]], which devours and dissolves anything in its path as it grows. It is the third film in [[The Blob (film series)|''The Blob'' film series]].\n\nFilmed in [[Abbeville, Louisiana]], ''The Blob'' was theatrically released in August 1988 by [[Tri-Star Pictures]] and was a box office failure, grossing $8.2 million against its budget of approximately $10 million. Though it received a mixed response from critics, the film has since accrued a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenousmonster.com/featured-article/the-blob-remake-retrospective/|title=The Blob: A Great Horror Remake 25 Years Later|author=Watson|first=Gregory|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=Ravenous Monster|access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nA [[meteorite]] crashes near Arborville, California. An elderly vagabond discovers, within the sphere, a massive [[slime mold]]-like substance that adheres to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the rescued man melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being consumed by the growing Blob. She tries freeing him, but his arm dissolves off. Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious. The Blob fully dissolves Paul and oozes out of the hospital.\n\nAfter Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman George is violently pulled into the sink's drain; killing him. The increasingly large creature pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but it retreats after entering the freezer. After consuming the diner's owner Fran Hewitt and Sheriff Geller, the Blob reenters the sewers. Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows, who orders the town and the two teens quarantined. While Brian escapes, Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother, Kevin had snuck into the movie theater with his friend Eddie. The Blob enters the theater, killing several staff and audience members. Meg arrives as the audience flees the theater, rescuing Eddie and Kevin.\n\nBrian learns the Blob is a biological warfare experiment created during the [[Cold War]]; it grew into a mixture of bacteria mutated from outer space radiation. Meddows decides to trap the Blob in the sewers even if that means allowing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie to die. Brian manages to evade military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers when he is found. Meg and Kevin flee from the Blob in the sewers; unfortunately, Eddie is consumed. Kevin escapes by scaling a pipe to the surface while Meg is saved by Brian. He confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. Meddows attempts to convince everyone Brian is contaminated and must die. When the plan fails, Meddows tries to shoot Brian, only for his own creation to kill him via oozing into his chemical suit and violently dragging him into the sewer. The military attempts to blow it up with grenades and other explosives. Unfortunately, this only succeeds in enraging the creature as it bursts from the sewers and feasts on the population. Reverend Meeker proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, after which a failed flamethrower attack sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher and also shoots the Blob with it. When the creature backs off, she realizes it cannot tolerate cold.\n\nThe survivors retreat to the town hall and hold the Blob off with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, but it is a losing battle; it engulfs half the building and devours Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a [[snowmaking|snow maker]] truck that has canisters of [[liquid nitrogen]] attached. As the Blob is about to consume Meg and her family, Brian shoots snow at it. Angered, the Blob turns its attention towards him and knocks the truck over in retaliation; also knocking him unconscious. Meg lures the Blob away from Brian toward the canisters, which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. The Blob is about to overrun both Brian and Meg when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob in liquid nitrogen, successfully flash-freezing it. Moss Woodley stores the Blob's crystallized remains in the town icehouse.\n\nLater, at a tent-meeting church service in a field, Meeker, disfigured by his burns and driven insane, preaches a doomsday sermon resembling the Blob's attack. One of his congregation asks when the day of reckoning will come. Meeker simply replies: \"Soon\". He then secretly holds up a glass jar containing a live piece of the Blob, saying: \"The Lord will give me a sign\". \n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

The threat of the original film was an alien entity from outer space. The remake differs in making the threat a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]], created by a secret government agency. The Blob is closely followed by soldiers and scientists in [[Environmental suit|protective suits]]. The change reflects the mentality of a more cynical era.<ref name=\"O'Neill\">O'Neill (2007), unnumbered pages</ref> The sinister government agents are opposed by rebellious teenager Brian Flagg ([[Kevin Dillon]]).
