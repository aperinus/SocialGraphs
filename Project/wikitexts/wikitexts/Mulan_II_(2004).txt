It is a sequel to the 1998 theatrically-released [[Walt Disney Animation|Disney]] animated film ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', featuring songs by [[Jeanine Tesori]] and [[Alexa Junge]]. Much of the cast from the first film returned, excluding [[Eddie Murphy]] (Mushu), [[Miriam Margolyes]] (The Matchmaker), [[James Hong]] (Chi-Fu), [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] (Little Brother), and [[Matthew Wilder]] (Ling's singing voice). Murphy and Margolyes were replaced by [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] and [[April Winchell]], respectively; Little Brother was voiced by [[Frank Welker]], and [[Gedde Watanabe]] does his own singing for the sequel. ''Mulan II'' features [[Fa Mulan|Mulan]] and her new fianc\u00e9, General [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|Li Shang]] on a special mission: escorting the Emperor's three daughters across the country to meet their soon-to-be fianc\u00e9s. The film deals with [[arranged marriage]]s, [[loyalty]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[Decision making|making choices]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and finding true [[love]]. Unlike its predecessor, which gained critical acclaim, ''Mulan II'' was panned by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA month after the events of the [[Mulan (1998 film)|first film]], [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] enjoys his restored status as a guardian spirit, to the dismay of the Fa family ancestors. [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|General Shang]] asks [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]] for her hand in marriage, and she happily accepts. Mushu is initially thrilled about the engagement, until the ancestors inform him that if Mulan marries Shang, his family ancestors and guardians would become hers; as a result, Mushu will lose his job. The Emperor calls upon Mulan and Shang and informs them of the threat the [[Mongols]] pose to China. To oppose them, the Emperor intends to strengthen China by forging an alliance with the kingdom of Qui Gong, arranging for his three daughters, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Daughters of the Emperor of China|Princesses Ting-Ting, Mei, and Su]], to be married to Qui Gong's princes, and assigns Mulan and Shang to protect them on their journey. Although uneasy at the idea of arranged marriage, Mulan agrees to the mission.\n\nMulan and Shang, along with [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Yao, Ling and Chien-Po]], set out with the princesses to Qui Gong. In order to protect his position as guardian, and believing that Mulan and Shang are incompatible due to their different behavior, Mushu tags along to sabotage their relationship, while [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Cri-Kee|Cri-Kee]] attempts to stop him. Mushu's attempts to cause problems for Mulan and Shang backfire, and he inadvertently destroys the princess's carriage. Now forced to travel on foot, Mulan and Shang briefly argue over what direction they should go, as well as their duties. Seeing this, Mushu manipulates Shang into believing that Mulan is fed up with him, escalating tensions between them.\n\nMeanwhile, Mei, Ting Ting and Su fall in love with Yao, Ling and Chien-Po respectively, and the princesses decide to follow Mulan's advice of having a duty to their hearts. That night, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po take the princesses out to a nearby village, and they mutually declare their love. Mulan pursues them, becoming happy that the princesses have followed their hearts. Mushu wakes up Shang, who pursues the group and reprimands them for forgetting about their duties. Mulan and Shang erupt into a heated argument, and decide that they are too different for each other and break-up.\n\nThe group begins travelling across bandit country, and Mushu realizes that Mulan's break-up with Shang has only made her miserable. Overwhelmed with guilt, Mushu confesses to his actions, losing Mulan's trust and motivating her to fix things with Shang. The group is attacked by bandits that attempt to kidnap the princesses. Although the princesses are saved, Mulan and Shang are left dangling on a broken bridge; Shang allowing himself to fall into the river so that Mulan can lift herself up. Believing Shang to be dead, a heartbroken Mulan declares that the princesses won't be forced into a loveless marriage, and continues on to Qui Gong alone. Mulan presents herself to Qui Gong's ruler, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki|Lord Qin]], and lies that the princesses have been killed, offering herself in their place; Lord Qui agrees, and arranges a wedding between Mulan and his eldest son, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki|Prince Jeeki]].\n\nShang turns up alive and meets up with Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and the princesses, and heads to Qui Gong. Shang interrupts the wedding and admits that Mulan was right about following her heart. To save Mulan and Shang from Lord Qin's forces, Mushu impersonates the Great Golden Dragon of Unity, forcing Lord Qin to ally himself with the Emperor, while allowing Mulan and Shang to marry and freeing the princesses from their vows. Some time later, Mulan and Shang officially marry in Mulan's village, and Mushu accepts the loss of his position. However, Shang combines the family temples, enabling Mushu to continue being a guardian spirit. While celebrating, Mushu accidentally reveals himself to Shang and Mulan. Shang reveals that he is already aware of Mushu's existence, and he and Mulan embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ming-Na Wen]] as [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]\n** [[Lea Salonga]] as Fa Mulan (singing voice)\n* [[BD Wong]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|General Li Shang]]\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Daughters of the Emperor of China|Princess Mei]]\n** Beth Blankenship as Princess Mei (singing voice)\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Daughters of the Emperor of China|Princess Ting-Ting]]\n** [[Judy Kuhn]] as Princess Ting-Ting (singing voice)\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Daughters of the Emperor of China|Princess Su]]\n** [[Mandy Gonzalez]] as Princess Su (singing voice)\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Ling]]\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Yao]]\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as [[List of Mulan characters#Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Chien-Po]]\n* [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]]\n* [[Pat Morita]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#The Emperor of China|The Emperor of China]]\n* [[George Takei]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mulan's family|First Ancestor Fa]]\n* [[June Foray]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mulan's family|Grandmother Fa]]\n* [[Freda Foh Shen]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mulan's family|Fa Li]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Cri-Kee|Cri-Kee]]/[[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Little Brother|Little Brother]]\n* [[Soon-Tek Oh]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mulan's family|Fa Zhou]]\n* [[April Winchell]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#The Matchmaker|The Matchmaker]]\n* Jillian Henry as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Sha-Ron|Sha-Ron]]\n* [[Keone Young]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Lord Qin and Prince Jeeki|Lord Qin]]\n* [[Michelle Kwan]] as Shopkeeper\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Mulan II\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = January 25, 2005\n| recorded   = 2004\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 31:41\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   = Brian Rawling<br />Graham Stack<br />Brett Swain\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r727257}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack contains songs from the film performed by various artists, as well as portions of the [[film score]] composed by [[Joel McNeely]].
