Set in the summer of 1987, recent college grad James Brennan (Eisenberg) is making big plans to tour Europe and attend graduate school in pursuit of a career in journalism. However, financial problems force him to look for a summer job instead of traveling abroad, which places him at Adventureland, a run-down amusement park in western [[Pennsylvania]] and loosely based on the \"[[Adventureland (New York)|Adventureland]]\" local theme park in Farmingdale, New York. There he meets Emily Lewin (Stewart), a co-worker with whom he develops a quick rapport and relationship.\n\nReleased on April 3, 2009, the film received positive reviews and earned $17.1&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It was nominated for \"Best Ensemble Cast Performance\" at the 19th Annual Gotham Independent Film Awards.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1987, James Brennan plans to have a summer vacation in Europe after graduating from [[Oberlin College]]. His parents inform him that their current finances will not permit them to support him and he will have to spend the summer working instead. James gets a job working the carnival games at Adventureland, a local amusement park in his hometown of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, where his childhood friend Tommy Frigo works.  Another games worker, Emily \"Em\" Lewin, saves James from being stabbed by a cheating customer and offers him a ride home that night.\n\nWith her father and stepmother out of town, Em throws a party. At the party, Em and James discover they share a similar taste in music. Em persuades James to join her in her swimming pool, but an unfortunately timed [[erection]] humiliates him in front of everyone. After the party, Mike Connell, who is married and has been having an [[affair]] with Em, comes over and they have sex. As the [[love triangle]] between Mike, Em, and James continues to develop, other romances blossom between their coworkers at Adventureland. James also has a brief romance with rides worker Lisa P.\n\nAnother of James' coworkers tells James that one night, he saw Em and Connell doing \"pushups without any pants on\" in the back of Connell's car. Frigo drives James to Connell's mother's house and they see Em leaving. James tells Lisa about the affair and asks her not to tell anyone, but she tells her friend Kelly and soon afterwards the news spreads throughout the park. Em quits and moves back to New York. James gets drunk, crashes his father's car into their neighbor's tree, and passes out. The next morning, James' prospective grad school roommate decides to go to [[Harvard Business School]] instead, leaving him with nowhere to live in New York.\n\nJames heads to New York City and waits outside Em's apartment in the rain. When she arrives, she invites him in and they reconcile.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as James Brennan, a recent graduate of [[Oberlin College]] who majored in [[Comparative Literature]] and [[Renaissance]] Studies.

The songs included are mostly from the 1980s, to fit with the setting of the film, with several tracks from the late 1960s and early 1970s, most notably by [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[New York Dolls]] and cult darlings [[Big Star]]. The '80s bands represent a cross section of alternative bands from the time including [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[The Cure]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], and [[Crowded House]].\n\nThe film maintains a notable reverence for Lou Reed, who is idolized by the main character, featured on T-shirts and posters of other cast members and has likewise elevated the status of the playground mechanic stemming from a rumored jam session with the artist. Earlier versions of the script replaced Lou Reed with singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] as the musician Ryan Reynolds's character had played with, and used Young's songs \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" and \"Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black)\" in key scenes.\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Adventureland -
