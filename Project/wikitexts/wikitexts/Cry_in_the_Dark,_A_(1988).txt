The screenplay by Schepisi and [[Robert Caswell]] is based on [[John Bryson (author)|John Bryson]]'s 1985 book of the same name. It chronicles the case of [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|Azaria Chamberlain]], a nine-week-old baby girl who disappeared from a campground near [[Ayers Rock]] in August 1980 and the struggle of her parents, [[Michael Chamberlain]] and [[Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton|Lindy Chamberlain]], to prove their innocence to a public convinced that they were complicit in her death. [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Sam Neill]] star as the Chamberlains.\n\nThe film was released less than two months after the Chamberlains were exonerated by the [[Court of Appeal of the Northern Territory of Australia|Northern Territory Court of Appeals]] of all charges filed against them.<ref>Harper, Dan. [http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/13/cry.html \"Review: 'A Cry in the Dark'.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225115956/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/13/cry.html |date=25 December 2010 }} ''SensesOfCinema.com'', March 2001. Retrieved: 25 April 2008.</ref> The film received generally favourable reviews, with Streep's performance receiving high praise and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], but was a box office disappointment, grossing only $6.9 million against its $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] pastor [[Michael Chamberlain]], his wife [[Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton|Lindy Chamberlain]], their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|Azaria]] are on a camping holiday in the Australian [[Outback]]. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family enjoys a [[barbecue]] with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check and is certain she sees a [[dingo]] with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying Azaria, and a subsequent [[inquest]] rules her account of events as true.\n\nHowever, the tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen the family. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's religious beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media report a rumour that the name Azaria means \"sacrifice in the wilderness\", the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite.\n\nLaw-enforcement officials find new witnesses, [[Forensic science|forensics]] experts, and [[circumstantial evidence]] and reopen the investigation, eventually charging Lindy with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play to the jury's sympathy and appears stoic on the stand, convincing some onlookers of her guilt. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife falter, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and immediately sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month suspended sentence.\n\nMore than three years later, while searching for the body of an English tourist who fell from [[Uluru]], police discover clothing that is identified as the jacket Lindy had insisted Azaria was wearing over her jumpsuit, which had been recovered early in the investigation. Lindy is immediately released from prison, the case is reopened and all convictions against the Chamberlains are overturned. The film ends with Michael commenting on the ongoing battle to clear the family's name.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton|Lindy Chamberlain]]\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Michael Chamberlain]]\n* [[Bruce Myles]] as [[Ian Barker (Australian barrister)|Ian Barker, Q.C.]]\n* Neil Fitzpatrick as [[John Harber Phillips|John Phillips, Q.C.]]\n* [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]] as [[James Muirhead|Justice James Muirhead]]\n* [[Maurie Fields]] as Justice Denis Barritt\n* [[Nick Tate]] as Det. Graeme Charlwood\n* [[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]] as Stuart Tipple\n* [[Dorothy Alison]] as Avis Murchison, Lindy's mother\n* [[Ruby Hunter]] as Judy Roberts\n* [[Vincent Gil]] as Roff\n\n==Production==\n[[John Bryson (author)|John Bryson]]'s book ''Evil Angels'' was published in 1985 and film rights were bought by [[Verity Lambert]], who got the interest of [[Meryl Streep]]. Robert Caswell wrote a script and [[Fred Schepisi]] agreed to direct. The movie was one of the most expensive and elaborate ever shot in Australia, with 350 speaking cast and 4,000 extras.<ref name=\"stratton2\">Stratton 1990, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] said the film \"has much of the manner of a television [[docudrama]], ultimately being a rather comforting celebration of personal triumph over travails so dread and so particular that they have no truly disturbing, larger application. Yet ''A Cry in the Dark'' is better than that, mostly because of another stunning performance by Meryl Streep, who plays Lindy Chamberlain with the kind of virtuosity that seems to redefine the possibilities of screen acting ... Though Sam Neill is very good as Lindy Chamberlain's tormented husband, Miss Streep supplies the guts of the melodrama that are missing from the screenplay.\"\n\n\"Mr. Schepisi has chosen to present the terrible events in the outback in such a way that there's never any doubt in the audience's mind about what happened. The audience doesn't worry about the fate of the Chamberlains as much as it worries about the unconvincing ease with which justice is miscarried. Mr. Schepisi may have followed the facts of the case, but he has not made them comprehensible in terms of the film. The manner by which justice miscarries is the real subject of the movie. In this screenplay, however, it serves only as a pretext for a personal drama that remains chilly and distant ... As a result, the courtroom confrontations are so weakened that ''A Cry in the Dark'' becomes virtually a one-character movie. It's Mr. Schepisi's great good fortune that that one character is portrayed by the incomparable Meryl Streep.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent.

Retrieved: 25 April 2008.</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"Schepisi is successful in indicting the court of public opinion, and his methodical (but absorbing) examination of the evidence helps us understand the state's circumstantial case. In the lead role, Streep is given a thankless assignment: to show us a woman who deliberately refused to allow insights into herself. She succeeds, and so, of course, there are times when we feel frustrated because we do not know what Lindy is thinking or feeling. We begin to dislike the character, and then we know how the Australian public felt. Streep's performance is risky, and masterful.\"<ref>Ebert, Roger.

It's not a showy performance, but the heroine's internal struggle seems to come from the actress' pores.
