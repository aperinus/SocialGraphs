The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, but performed well at the box office, grossing $44.5 million on a $23 million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter pranking on Principal Prickly on the last day of school before summer vacation, T.J. Detweiler is excited to spend the time off with his friends, only to be disappointed to learn they will all be attending different summer camps. Resigned to spending the summer alone, T.J. notices strange activity at Third Street School. Investigating further, he sees scientists performing strange experiments with a [[tractor beam]]. After neither his parents nor the police believe him, he goes to Prickly, who prepares to show T.J. the school is empty, but is [[Teleportation in fiction|dematerialized]] when trying to enter the building. \n\nDesperate, T.J. blackmails his older sister Becky to drive him to all the camps to retrieve his friends. They all return with him to Third Street School, but accuse him of deceit after recovering a box of inconsequential documents from the school. T.J.'s suspicions are verified when they all see a giant laser emerging from the school roof and formulate a plan of camp during the day and meeting up at night. After T.J. finds Prickly's discarded pants with a note reading \"Help Me!\" in the pocket, the gang infiltrate the school to rescue him. School snitch Randall Weems, who has been eavesdropping on them, goes to inform deputy principal Muriel Finster.\n\nThe kids find the auditorium has been turned into a laboratory. T.J. is captured by guards while his friends escape and is imprisoned with Prickly. They both discover that Prickly's old rival Dr. Phillium Benedict is overseeing the operation inside the school. Prickly exposits Benedict's background to T.J.: in 1968, while he, Benedict and Finster were all in teacher training, Benedict was appointed Principal of Third Street School and proposed abolishing [[Recess (break)|recess]] to improve test grades. Prickly asked the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] to encourage Benedict to rescind, but when he declined, he was replaced as principal with Prickly. Swearing revenge on Prickly, Benedict became [[United States Secretary of Education|secretary of education]] but was fired by the [[President of the United States|President]] for reattempting to abolish recess nationwide.\n\nWhile T.J.\u2019s friends review the recovered papers, Spinelli finds a date book that mentions [[Apsis|lunar perigee]] (taking place at 12:22 pm the next day). Gretchen realizes the machine they saw is a tractor beam and concludes that Benedict intends to use it to move the moon when it nears Earth. T.J. and Prickly get to Prickly\u2019s office, where they discover Benedict\u2019s plan to eradicate summer vacation by creating a new permanent [[Ice age|Ice Age]] that will force kids indoors year-round. Meanwhile, T.J.\u2019s friends persuade Becky to drive them to the camps and pick up all the other students, while Finster rallies the teachers, and Gus takes charge, concocting a plan to infiltrate the school.\n\nAs Benedict prepares to enact his plan in the auditorium, the students and teachers of Third Street School all attempt to stop him and his henchmen. During the ensuing battle, Benedict attempts to activate the beam himself but is stopped by Prickly, only for Benedict to break the controls and make the process irreversible. T.J. instructs Vince to throw a baseball at the beam, which destroys it. Finally aware of Benedict's plot, the police arrive at the school to arrest him and his henchmen. T.J.'s friends decide to spend the rest of their summer together. T.J. thanks Prickly in his office, who in turn thanks T.J. for reminding him why he started teaching: to help kids. T.J. then joins his friends as Prickly jokingly reminds T.J. he will still be reprimanded for his earlier prank when September comes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] as Theodore Jasper \"T.J.\" Detweiler, the leader of the Recess gang.\n* [[Rickey D'Shon Collins]] as Vince LaSalle, T.J.\u2019s athletic best friend. \n* [[Jason Davis (actor, born 1984)|Jason Davis]] as Mikey Blumberg, an [[Obesity|obese]] boy with an operatic singing voice.\n** [[Robert Goulet]] as Mikey's singing voice.
