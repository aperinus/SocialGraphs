The first installment in [[Halloweentown (film series)|''Halloweentown'' series]] starring [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Kimberly J. Brown]], [[Joey Zimmerman]], and [[Judith Hoag]].<ref name=\"INSIDER\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/halloweentown-fun-facts-2018-10|title = 21 interesting things you probably didn't know about 'Halloweentown'|website = [[Insider.com]] |first1=Julia |last1=Guerra |first2=Fiona |last2=Clair |date=October 2018}}</ref> It is the fourth Disney Channel Original Movie. It centers on Marnie, who on her 13th Halloween, learns she's a witch, discovers a secret portal, and is transported to Halloweentown\u2014a magical place where ghosts and ghouls, witches and werewolves live apart from the human world: but she soon finds herself battling wicked warlocks, evil curses, and endless surprises.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Marnie Piper and her mother, Gwen, arguing over why she and her younger siblings Dylan and Sophie cannot go out for [[Halloween]]. Gwen's mother Aggie shows up for her annual Halloween visit. The children are happier to see Aggie than Gwen is, as Aggie openly encourages the children to get more involved in Halloween. Aggie and Gwen are secretly [[Witchcraft|witches]], but Gwen is determined to live a normal life as a mortal instead.\n\nDespite objections from Gwen, Aggie is intent on training Marnie as a witch. Before heading home, Aggie reads the children a bedtime story called \"Halloweentown\", about a mystical place where witches, vampires and monsters of all sorts live in peace away from mortals. Sophie points out a drawing of a witch in the book that resembles Marnie; Aggie does nothing to stop Marnie from imagining such a thing. After putting the children to bed, Gwen and Aggie get into an argument, with Marnie, who has sneaked downstairs, eavesdropping. Gwen is angry that her mother encourages the children to enjoy Halloween, and insists Marnie will be raised as a mortal, like her father was, and not a witch, revealing Marnie is actually a witch too. Aggie doesn't understand why Gwen wants to live without magic, and wants to train Marnie before she turns 13, as at this point without training, she would lose her powers forever. Aggie then asks Gwen for help; citizens of Halloweentown have been disappearing, and while Gwen doesn't take this seriously and says it is possible that the missing have simply moved, Aggie believes that foul play is involved.\n\nWhen Aggie leaves to return home, Marnie and Dylan covertly follow her. They see Aggie getting onto a magical bus, and sneak onto it through the back door. When they arrive in Halloweentown, Aggie does not see Marnie and Dylan getting off the bus, and the children lose sight of her. At the same time, Marnie and Dylan realize that Sophie has sneaked onto the bus with them. They begin looking for Aggie, and are approached by Kalabar, the [[mayor]] of Halloweentown. He whistles for a cab driven by Benny, a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] with a bad sense of humor. The children find their grandmother's [[mansion]], and against her better judgment, Aggie decides not to take them back to their home immediately. She says she will start Marnie's witch training, but has to take care of \"the bad thing\" first. She shows her grandchildren what she is talking about: in her cauldron, a vision of a hooded figure appears, laughing maniacally. She says she must activate [[Merlin]]'s talisman with a spell and potion to defeat the evil creature.\n\nAfter trying, and failing, to light the talisman with \"instant\" potion, Aggie takes the children back to town to shop for the right ingredients. The family is introduced to Luke, a [[goblin]] who was made handsome by a \"shadow creature\". He makes a clumsy pass at Marnie, which she turns down on the spot. Gwen, who had noticed her children were missing and immediately blamed Aggie, arrives in Halloweentown to retrieve them, much to Marnie's objections. Gwen tells the children to say goodbye to Aggie, then takes them to the bus station, but cannot find another bus back to the mortal world according to a two-headed ticket vendor, whose two heads are constantly arguing with each other, and decides to see if the mayor can do anything to help. She is shocked to see that the mayor is Kalabar, an ex-boyfriend of hers. After Kalabar briefly leaves to handle another problem, Gwen and her children see Aggie walking somewhere with Luke. Sensing Aggie might be in trouble, they follow Luke and her to an abandoned [[movie theater]].\n\nAggie meets the hooded demon in the theater, where the missing Halloweentown citizens have been frozen in time. Aggie declines to give the talisman to the demon. Gwen and the children enter the theater as Luke rushes out in fear. The demon freezes Gwen and Aggie. The children escape, and obtain the necessary ingredients{{ndash}}the hair of a [[werewolf]], the sweat of a [[ghost]], and a [[vampire]]'s fang{{ndash}}to make the potion that will activate the talisman. They then realize they must place the talisman in the large [[jack-o'-lantern]] in the center of the town to defeat the demon.\n\nWhen they arrive to install it, the demon suddenly appears and reveals himself to be Kalabar, who is bitter that Gwen (whom he used to date when she was a teenager) chose to marry a human instead of him. He starts talking to the townspeople and tries to persuade them to join him and take over the mortal world. With the help of Luke, Marnie slips past Kalabar long enough to climb up onto the jack-o'-lantern and try to place the talisman inside. Kalabar, noticing this, casts a spell to freeze her. As she is about to pass out, Marnie drops the talisman inside the jack-o'-lantern, which causes it to illuminate. This unfreezes her and everyone trapped inside the theater, and severely weakens Kalabar. Kalabar obtains the talisman and says he will use it to become the ruler of both the mortal and magical world. Dylan is revealed to have magic powers and eventually joins Gwen, Aggie, and his sisters in confronting Kalabar and using their combined powers to defeat him. Luke is restored to his goblin appearance.\n\nThe film ends with the family getting on the bus and blasting off to the mortal world. Gwen and Aggie decide to train Marnie as a witch and Aggie decides to stay in the mortal world to spend more time with her grandchildren.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kimberly J.

Since the movie was to air in the 9pm timeslot, the film was geared towards an adult demographic. As a result original script was much darker and mature.<ref name=\"Bustle\"/> In 1994, the script was presented to NBC, and the network decided to pass on the project.<ref name=\"E!\"/> Singer ended up leaving the Walt Disney Company at the end of January 1994.\n\nIn 1997, Singer and White established, ''Singer/White Entertainment'',<ref name=\"LukeFord\"/> and returned to the idea of ''Halloweentown.'' The duo pitched it to [[Disney Channel]] who initially passed on the project as well. The executives at the network changed their mind after they aired ''[[Under Wraps (film)|Under Wraps]]'', which was well received. The network returned to Singer/White Entertainment and the film was redeveloped into more of a children's film.<ref name=\"E!\"/>\n\nIn a 2018 interview with [[Insider Inc.|Insider]], director Duwayne Dunham revealed the film was presented to him as a, \"$20 million to $30 million project\" \u2014 but the budget ended up only being $4 million.<ref name=\"INSIDER\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mtv.com/news/7ychl3/halloweentown-secrets-from-set |title=Revisiting 'Halloweentown' 17 Years Later: The Star And Director Share Secrets From Set |date=October 14, 2015 |publisher=MTV |first=Crystal |last=Bell |archive-date=September 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928170331/https://www.mtv.com/news/7ychl3/halloweentown-secrets-from-set}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter receiving the go ahead from Disney Channel, Singer/White Entertainment began casting. The first person cast for the film was [[Debbie Reynolds]], who at the time had just decided to venture into television work. A list of actors were purposed to Singer/White, and Sheri Singer said, \"When we saw the list, we took one look at her name and said, oh my god, would she really do it? This is absolutely unbelievably blessed and terrific idea for casting... We never went to anyone else.\"<ref name=\"E!\"/>\n\nIn September 2016, Kimberly J.

Hoag, who had previously played [[April O'Neil]] said \"I kind of knew in the room that I had gotten the job because his son was a die-hard [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Ninja Turtle]] fan.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=QSYfGj06b84|time=8m40s|title='Halloweentown' GalaxyCon Q&A Panel 2020 (8m40s Timestamp)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Singer, the hardest role to cast was that of antagonist Kalabar, \"...he had to be scary-but-Disney-Channel-scary.\"<ref name=\"E!\"/> [[Robin Thomas]], who had previously worked with White on [[Amityville Dollhouse]] was brought in to audition, and was the final choice.\n\n===Pre-production===\nAfter Kimberly J. Brown was cast as Marnie, artists used a photo of her to create the \"Halloweentown\" book prop. The image of the witch flying across the page needed to resemble the actress.<ref name=\"BTS\"/>\n\nThe initial ending of the film featured Marnie traveling deep into an enchanted forest to place the talisman. With each step the character was supposed to grow older the deeper into the forest she went, the make-up department took a [[life-mask]] of Kimberly J. Brown to make the different prosthetics to age Marnie. Before the make-up process was completed, the ending was rewritten to the character placing the talisman in the [[Jack-o'-lantern]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.j-14.com/posts/8-secrets-about-the-disney-channel-original-movie-halloweentown-115779/?display=listicle#photo-anchor |title=Spooky Season: Behind-the-Scenes Secrets You Never Knew About Disney Channel's 'Halloweentown' |first=Shelby |last=Stivale |date=October 4, 2021 |publisher=[[J-14 (magazine)|J-14]] }}</ref><ref name=\"BTS\">{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/pablovaldivia/behind-the-scenes-facts-halloweentown |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=October 17, 2018 |title=\"Halloweentown\" Debuted 20 Years Ago, So Here Are 18 Facts About The Film |first=Pablo |last=Valdivia}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Halloweentown'' was filmed in [[St. Helens, Oregon]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2279997/kimberly-j-brown-returns-to-halloweentown-st-helens-festival/|title=Kimberly J.
