It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[Air Bud]]''. The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is also the last of the ''Air Bud'' films to be released theatrically. Outside the United States the film was often titled ''Air Bud 2''. This film is dedicated in memory of the original Air Bud ([[Air Buddy (dog)|Air Buddy]]), who died of Synovial sarcoma \u2013 a rare form of cancer that affects soft tissue near the joints of the arm, leg, or neck \u2013 in 1998, several months before the movie's release.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, ''Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' was a [[box office bomb|box office failure]], receiving negative reviews and grossing $10,224,116 against a budget of $11 million. The film received a 21% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10.<ref>{{Citation|title=Air Bud 2 - Golden Receiver|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/air_bud_golden_receiver?|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-05}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nJosh Framm ([[Kevin Zegers]]), now a teenager and a basketball player, becomes angry with his mother, Jackie, when she begins dating Patrick Sullivan, the town's new veterinarian, after a couple of failed dates with other people. Patrick innocently tosses Josh's basketball-savvy dog, Buddy, a football one day, and Josh discovers that Buddy also has an uncanny ability to play the sport of [[American football|football]]. Soon enough, Buddy begins playing on Josh's Junior High football team after Tommy convinces Josh to sign up for football instead of basketball. At first, the team is failing miserably, and the school intends to fire the coach if he does not start winning. However, thanks to Buddy's superior football skills and fast running, the team keeps on winning and makes the playoffs. In addition, they advance to the championship.\n\nMeanwhile, two Russians by the names of Natalya and Popov kidnap Buddy in hopes of having him perform as the special attraction in the Russian circus while Josh runs away when Patrick proposes to his mother. His coach finds him and convinces him that just because Patrick is in his life now, he does not have to stop loving his father and he returns home, but Patrick is gone and Buddy is missing.\n\nThe Timberwolves are forced to play the championship game without Buddy and are losing terribly. Buddy, in Natalya's and Popov's hands, knocks his cage over to unlock the hatch on a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]'s cage hence letting the chimpanzee out, who then in return lets Buddy out. Buddy and the chimpanzee release all the other animals and they manage to escape. After the chimpanzee ambushes Natalya and Popov with fish guts and sword fighting, Natalya and Popov are arrested and placed into the custody of the [[Russian embassy]] as they collide their van, where they fly out of it and fall into a [[fishing vessel]] following a chase sequence involving Buddy as the victim.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick finds Buddy and takes him to the game.  With the help of Buddy, the team catches up, but Buddy is taken out of the game due to a subsequent injury. The Timberwolves are forced to finish the game without him and thanks to Josh and Tommy, they win the championship.\n\nLater, Josh stops Patrick from leaving on a boat and convinces him to stay with the family.  The family later goes to a [[Seattle Seahawks]] football game and Buddy sneaks onto the field.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* Rush as Buddy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140796/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998) - IMDb}}</ref>\n* Chase as Buddy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140796/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998) - IMDb}}</ref>\n* Zak as Buddy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140796/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998) - IMDb}}</ref>\n* Chance as Buddy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140796/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998) - IMDb}}</ref>\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Josh Framm\n* [[Gregory Harrison]] as Dr. Patrick Sullivan\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Coach Jimmy Fanelli\n* [[Tim Conway]] as Fred Davis\n* [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]] as Phil Phil\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Jackie Framm (Josh's mother)\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Natalya\n* [[Perry Anzilotti]] as Popov\n* Shayn Solberg as Tom Stewart\n* Suzanne Ristic as Principal Salter\n* Alyson MacLaren as Andrea Framm\n* [[Warren Moon]] as Himself \n* [[Joey Galloway]] as Himself\n}}\n\n== Rating ==\nPrior to the film's theatrical release, it was originally rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] (as seen in the original theatrical trailer).<ref>[http://www.retrojunk.com/movie/trailers/995-air-bud-2-golden-receiver/1313/#intro Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver Movie Trailers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, by the time the film was released in theaters, it was given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G]] rating by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], making it the first ''Air Bud'' film to have been designated that rating in the United States.\n\n== Home video release ==\nThis film was released to VHS on December 15, 1998, and was later released to DVD in 2000.
