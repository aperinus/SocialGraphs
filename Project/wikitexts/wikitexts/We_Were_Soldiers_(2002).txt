Based on the book ''[[We Were Soldiers Once\u2026 and Young]]'' (1992) by [[Hal Moore|Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore]] and reporter [[Joseph L. Galloway]], it dramatizes the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] on November 14, 1965.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954 a French unit (based loosely on the [[Battle of Mang Yang Pass|Groupement Mobile No. 100]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://parallelnarratives.com/vietnam-notebook-groupement-mobile-100-bataillon-de-coree/ | title=Vietnam Vignette: The French Groupement Mobile 100 | date=August 6, 2011 }}</ref>) on patrol during the [[First Indochina War]] is ambushed by [[Viet Minh]] forces. Viet Minh commander [[Nguyen Huu An]] orders his soldiers to \"kill all they send, and they will stop coming\".\n\nEleven years later, the United States is fighting the [[Vietnam War]]. [[US Army]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Hal Moore]] is chosen to train and lead a battalion. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been [[Siege of Plei Me|attacked]] and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the North Vietnamese attackers although intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. Moore leads a newly-created [[Air assault|air cavalry unit]] into the [[Ia Drang Valley]]. After landing, the soldiers capture a North Vietnamese soldier and learn from him that the location they were sent to is actually the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese army division of 4,000 men.\n\nUpon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots an enemy scout and runs after him, ordering his reluctant soldiers to follow. The scout lures them into an ambush, which results in several men being killed, including Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded and cut off from the rest of the battalion. Sgt. Savage assumes command, calls in the artillery, and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from overrunning their defensive position.\n\nMeanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off units, Moore manages to secure weak points before the North Vietnamese can take advantage of them. Despite being trapped and desperately outnumbered, the main US force manages to hold off the North Vietnamese with artillery, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and helicopter airlifts of supplies and reinforcements. Eventually, Nguyen Huu An, the commander of the North Vietnamese division, orders a large-scale attack on the American position.\n\nBack in the United States, Julia Moore has become the leader of the American wives who live on the base. When the Army begins to use [[yellow cab]] drivers to deliver telegrams that notify the next of kin of the soldiers' deaths in combat, Julia personally assumes that emotional responsibility instead.\n\nAt the point of being overrun by the enemy, Moore orders 1st Lt. Charlie Hastings, his [[Forward air controllers in the Vietnam War|forward air controller]], to call in \"Broken Arrow,\" which is a call for all available combat aircraft to assist and attack enemy positions, even those close to the US troops' position because a position is being overrun and can no longer be defended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/broken_arrow|title=broken arrow - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org}}</ref> The aircraft attack with bombs, [[napalm]], and machine guns, killing many [[People's Army of Vietnam|PAVN]] and [[Viet Cong]] troops, but a [[friendly fire]] incident also results in American deaths. The North Vietnamese attack is repelled, and the surviving soldiers of Herrick's cut-off platoon, including Savage, are rescued.\n\nMoore's troops regroup and secure the area. Nguyen Huu An plans a final assault on the Americans and sends most of his troops to carry out the attack, but Moore and his men overrun them and approach the enemy command center. Before the base camp guards can open fire, Major [[Bruce Crandall|Bruce \"Snake\" Crandall]] and other helicopter gunships attack and destroy the remnant of the enemy force. With no more troops to call on, Huu An quickly orders the headquarters evacuated.\n\nHaving achieved his objective, Moore returns to the helicopter landing zone to be picked up. Only after everyone (including the dead and wounded) is removed from the battlefield does he fly out of the valley. Sometime later, Nguyen Huu An and his men arrive on the battlefield to collect their dead. He claims that the Americans will \"think this was their victory. So this will become an American war\".\n\nAt the end of the film, it is revealed that the landing zone immediately reverted to North Vietnamese hands after the American troops were airlifted out. Hal Moore continued the battle in a different landing zone, and after nearly a year, he returned home safely to Julia and his family. His superiors congratulate him for killing over 1,800 [[People's Army of Vietnam|North Vietnamese Army]] and [[Viet Cong]] soldiers. An older Moore visits the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial|Vietnam War memorial]] and looks at the names of the soldiers who fell at Ia Drang.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Lieutenant Colonel/Colonel [[Hal Moore]]\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as [[Julia Compton Moore|Julia Moore]]\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Major [[Bruce P.

For instance, the film depicts a heroic charge under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore at the end of the battle that destroys the Vietnamese reserve, ending the battle in an American victory (a fact that the director noted in his commentary).<ref>{{cite news |title= We Were Soldiers Once - Director's commentary |asin= B000K7UG34}}</ref> In fact, there was no heroic final charge in the book, and the North Vietnamese forces were not destroyed, although the American commander Moore reported 834 enemy bodies and 1215 estimated KIA (one third of the enemy force).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.generalhieu.com/lzxray_moore_hieu-2.htm|title=Colonel Hieu and LTC Hal Moore re: LZ X-Ray After Action Report (m)|website=General Hieu.com}}</ref> The US forces were reduced by 72 out of 395, with 18% fatal casualties. The Vietnamese commander, Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An, did not see the conclusion at LZ X-Ray as the end of combat, and the battle continued the next day with combat action at LZ Albany, where the 2/7th, with A Company 1/5th, found themselves in a fight for their lives against Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An's reserve.\n\nDespite the differences from the book and departures from historical accuracy, Moore stated in a documentary included in the video versions that the film was the first one \"to get [the war] right.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Getting It Right: Behind the scenes of ''We Were Soldiers'', Bonus Feature|work=We Were Soldiers|edition= Blu-Ray |asin=B000K7UG34}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 63% based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The consensus reads, \"The war cliches are laid on a bit thick, but the movie succeeds at putting a human face on soldiers of both sides in the Vietnam War.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_were_soldiers|title=We Were Soldiers (2002)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 65 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/we-were-soldiers | title=We Were Soldiers | website=[[Metacritic]] | access-date=September 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave ''We Were Soldiers'' 3.5 stars out of 4, and praised its truthful and realistic battle scenes and how it follows the characters: \"''Black Hawk Down'' was criticized because the characters seemed hard to tell apart. ''We Were Soldiers'' doesn't have that problem; in the Hollywood tradition it identifies a few key players, casts them with stars, and follows their stories.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/we-were-soldiers-2002|title=We Were Soldiers movie review}}</ref> Lisa Schwarzbaum, from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', gave the film a B and noted its fair treatment of both sides: \"The writer-director bestows honor \u2013 generously, apolitically \u2013 not only on the dead and still living American veterans who fought in Ia Drang, but also on their families, on their Vietnamese adversaries, and on the families of their adversaries too. Rarely has a foe been portrayed with such measured respect for a separate reality, which should come as a relief to critics (I'm one) of the enemy's facelessness in ''Black Hawk Down''; vignettes of gallantry among Vietnamese soldiers and such humanizing visual details as a Vietnamese sweetheart's photograph left behind, in no way interfere with the primary, rousing saga of a fine American leader who kept his promise to his men to 'leave no one behind dead or alive.'\"<ref name=\"Schwarzbaum\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,213548,00.html|title=We Were Soldiers|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=February 28, 2002|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2009-08-03|archive-date=October 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020122540/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,213548,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDavid Sterritt, from the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', criticized the film for giving a more positive image of the [[Vietnam War]] that, in his opinion, did not concur with reality: \"The films about Vietnam that most Americans remember are positively soaked in physical and emotional torment \u2013 from ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', with its grunt's-eye view of combat, to ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', with its exploration of war's dehumanizing insanity. Today, the pendulum has swung back again. If filmmakers with politically twisted knives once sliced away guts-and-glory clich\u00e9s, their current equivalents hack away all meaningful concern with moral and political questions. ''We Were Soldiers'' is shameless in this regard, filling the screen with square-jawed officers who weep at carnage and fresh-faced GIs who use their last breaths to intone things like, 'I'm glad I died for my country.'\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0301/p15s02-almo.html|title=A fake picture of war's stark reality|first=David|last=Sterritt|date=March 1, 2002 |work=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>\n\nTodd McCarthy, from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', wrote the film \"presents the fighting realistically, violently and relatively coherently given the chaotic circumstances...\" McCarthy further wrote, \"Mel Gibson has the closest thing to a [[John Wayne]] part that anyone's played since the Duke himself rode into the sunset, and he plays it damn well.\" He summarized with, \"Gibson's performance anchors the film with commanding star power to burn. This officer truly loves his men, and the credibility with which the actor is able to express Moore's leadership qualities as well as his sensitive side is genuinely impressive.\"<ref name=\"McCarthy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917064.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=We Were Soldiers|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=February 22, 2002|work=Variety|access-date=March 5, 2010|archive-date=June 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622010433/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917064.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHal Moore, who had long been critical of many Vietnam War films for their negative portrayals of American servicemen, publicly expressed approval of the film and is featured in segments of the DVD. Some soldiers were less pleased: Retired Col [[Rick Rescorla]], who played an important role in the book and was pictured on the cover (and later died in the [[September 11 attacks]]), was disappointed, after reading the script, to learn that he and his unit had been written out of the film.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}} In one key incident, the finding of a vintage French bugle on a dying Vietnamese soldier, the [[England|English]]-born Rescorla is replaced by a nameless [[Wales|Welsh]] platoon leader.<ref name=\"Heart\">{{cite book | author1=Stewart, James B. |date=2002| title=Heart of a Soldier| publisher=Simon & Schuster |location= New York |page=236|isbn=0743244591}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/20/books/books-of-the-times-one-last-act-of-bravery-for-an-intrepid-adventurer.html | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; One Last Act of Bravery For an Intrepid Adventurer | date=November 20, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rickrescorla.com|title=Rick Rescorla Memorial}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ranger25.com/RescorlaFlier30JUN2002.doc|title=ranger25.com|website=www.ranger25.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/25959|title=DHS names citizen resilience award in memory of Rick Rescorla |publisher=Government Security News}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0277434}}\n* {{allrovi movie|259501}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=419310}}\n* {{AFI film|id=62631|title=We Were Soldiers}}\n* {{mojo title|weweresoldiers}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|we_were_soldiers}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Randall Wallace}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:We Were Soldiers}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action war films]] <!-- http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/we-were-soldiers-v259501 -->\n[[Category:American action war films]] <!-- http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/we-were-soldiers-v259501 -->\n[[Category:Battle of Ia Drang]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nick Glennie-Smith]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Randall Wallace]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bruce Davey]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1954]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1965]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Icon Productions films]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War films]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-language films]]\n[[Category:War films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Army]]\n[[Category:Films set in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Impact of the September 11 attacks on cinema]]\n[[Category:Film controversies in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
