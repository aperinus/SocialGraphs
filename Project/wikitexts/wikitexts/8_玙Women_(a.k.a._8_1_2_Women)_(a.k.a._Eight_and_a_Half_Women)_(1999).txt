An international co-production of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany, it was entered into the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5335/year/1999.html | title=Festival de Cannes: 8\u00bd Women | access-date=2009-10-04| work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the death of his wife Amelia, wealthy businessman Philip Emmenthal ([[John Standing]]) and his son Storey ([[Matthew Delamere]]) open their own private [[harem]] in their family residence in [[Geneva]]. They get the idea while watching [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8\u00bd|{{frac|8|1|2}}]]'' and after Storey is \"given\" a woman, Simato ([[Annie Shizuka Inoh|Shizuka Inoh]]), to waive her [[pachinko]] debts. They sign one-year contracts with eight (and a half) women to this effect.\n\nThe women each have a gimmick (one is a [[nun]], another a [[kabuki]] performer, etc.). Philip soon becomes dominated by his favorite of the [[concubine]]s, Palmira ([[Polly Walker]]), who has no interest in Storey as a lover, despite what their contract might stipulate. Philip dies, the concubines' contracts expire, and Storey is left alone with Giulietta (the titular {{nobreak|\"{{1/2}}\"}} as an amputee) and of course the money and the houses.\n\nWhile the film deals with and graphically describes diverse sexual acts in conversation, the film does not feature any sex scenes as such, though it does contain several instances of male nudity.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=8\u00bd Women |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/8-12-women-2000 |website=Rogerebert.com |access-date=29 December 2020 |date=9 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Standing]] as Philip Emmenthal\n* Matthew Delamere as Storey Emmenthal\n* [[Vivian Wu]] as Kita\n* [[Annie Shizuka Inoh|Shizuka Inoh]] as Simato\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Griselda / Sister Concordia\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Beryl\n* [[Natacha Amal]] as Giaconda \n* [[Barbara Sarafian]] as Clothilde\n* {{ill|Kirina Mano|ja|\u771f\u91ce\u304d\u308a\u306a}} as Mio\n* Manna Fujiwara as Giulietta/Half Woman\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Palmira\n* [[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Celeste\n* [[Myriam Muller]] as Marianne\n* [[Don Warrington]] as Simon\n* Claire Johnston as Amelia\n}}\n\n==Production==\nToni Collette said Peter Greenaway chose her by accident for the role of Griselda. \"I went in for another part and I had just had my head shaved and I had a Buddha hanging around my neck.
