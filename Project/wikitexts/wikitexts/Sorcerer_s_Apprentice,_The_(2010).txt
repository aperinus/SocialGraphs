The film stars [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] with [[Alfred Molina]], [[Teresa Palmer]], and [[Monica Bellucci]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is named after a segment in Disney's non-consecutive film pair the 1940 film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and the 1999 film ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' called ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' starring [[Mickey Mouse]] (with one scene being an extensive reference to it), which in turn is based on the late-1890s [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|symphonic poem]] by [[Paul Dukas]] and the 1797 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice|ballad]]. Balthazar Blake ([[Nicolas Cage]]), a \"Merlinean\", is a sorcerer in modern-day [[Manhattan]], fighting against the forces of evil, in particular his nemesis, Maxim Horvath ([[Alfred Molina]]), while searching for the person who will eventually inherit [[Merlin]]'s powers (\"The Prime Merlinean\"). This turns out to be Dave Stutler ([[Jay Baruchel]]), a physics student, whom Balthazar takes as a reluctant prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The sorcerer gives his unwilling apprentice a crash course in the art of science, magic, and sorcery, in order to stop Horvath and [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]] ([[Alice Krige]]) from raising the souls of the evil dead sorcerers (\"Morganians\") and destroying the world.\n\n''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' made its premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival on July 8, 2010, and was theatrically released by Disney in the [[United States]] on July 14. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing only $215 million against a $150 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=14 Worst Performing Disney Movies Ever Made |url=https://screenrant.com/worst-performing-disney-movies-box-office-flops/ |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=Screen Rant}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Before adding material please review guidelines at [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nIn 740 AD, in [[England]], the mighty magician [[Merlin]] has three apprentices; Balthazar Blake, Veronica Gorloisen and Maxim Horvath. Horvath betrays his master by joining forces with the evil sorceress [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]]. Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before Veronica is able to rip Morgana's soul from her body and absorbs it into her own. As Morgana attempts to kill Veronica by possessing her from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the \"Grimhold\", a magic prison in the shape of a [[nesting doll]]. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine that will identify the Prime Merlinean, Merlin's descendant and the only one able to defeat Morgana. While he searches for his descendant throughout history, Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold.\n\nIn 2000, in [[New York City]], the Prime Merlinean is revealed to be 10-year-old Dave Stutler, who encounters Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store, after straying from his school field trip. When Balthazar gives Dave Merlin's dragon figurine, the statue comes to life and wraps itself around the boy's finger to form a ring. When Balthazar goes to retrieve a book meant to teach magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing the imprisoned Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese [[urn]] with a ten-year lock curse. Dave is then ridiculed by his classmates when he claims he saw magic, only to find the shop empty. He is faced with severe [[bullying]], and is [[misdiagnosed]] with [[hallucination]] caused by a \"[[glucose]] imbalance\", whilst nevertheless keeping the ring.\n\nTen years later, Dave, now 20 years old, is a [[physics]] student at [[New York University]], and meets his childhood crush Becky. He immediately becomes smitten with her, and repairs the transmitting mast of the radio station she works at after it is struck by lightning. The ten-year imprisonment curse of the urn ends, releasing Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath pursues Dave and the Grimhold. Balthazar rescues Dave, riding an animated steel eagle adapted from a [[Chrysler Building]] gargoyle. Dave initially refuses to help Balthazar, having been under [[psychiatric]] care since their first meeting, until Balthazar agrees to leave after finding the Grimhold. They track the Grimhold to [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where Horvath has released the next Morganian, Sun Lok. Dave defeats Sun Lok, and Balthazar retrieves the Grimhold. Dave changes his mind, deciding that he likes magic after all, and agrees to become Balthazar's apprentice. He also becomes romantically involved with Becky against Balthazar's wishes and advice, impressing her by playing the [[OneRepublic]] song \"[[Secrets (OneRepublic song)|Secrets]]\" with the [[Tesla coils]] he has been experimenting with.\n\nHorvath enlists a youthful Morganian, celebrity magician Drake Stone to get back the Grimhold. They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar's quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. Morgana, if freed, would cast a spell called \"The Rising\", which would revive sorcerers from the dead and enslave mankind. As Prime Merlinian, Dave will become powerful enough to cast spells without his ring (a focus, which for any other magician is the only way to channel their magic), and is the only one who can stop her. Despite Balthazar's disdain of his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab, but loses control of his animated cleaning mops, which forces him to cancel his date with Becky. He is saved because of Balthazar's intervention and, disillusioned, decides to give up on magic, until Becky unknowingly changes his mind. He returns to his underground subway lab, just as Drake and Horvath try to kill Balthazar and steal the Grimhold. Horvath, having no more use for Drake, casts a parasite spell and steals Drake's magic and his ring.\n\nHorvath releases the witch [[Abigail Williams]], uses her to kidnap Becky at the radio station, then steals her magic and pendant focus. He threatens to kill Becky, therefore forcing Dave to surrender the Grimhold and his ring. Balthazar goes after Horvath in [[Battery Park]], sure that Dave, without his ring, will be killed. Horvath releases Morgana, who begins the Rising Spell while Horvath animates the [[Charging Bull]] sculpture and commands it to attack Balthazar. Dave arrives and stuns Horvath with a Tesla coil tied to Balthazar's car while Balthazar's eagle flies away with the bull. Becky disrupts the Rising Spell, stunning Morgana. Balthazar takes Morgana, body and soul, from Veronica into himself, but Morgana escapes and tries to incinerate them. Dave attempts to stop her without his ring and succeeds, proving that he is the Prime Merlinean. Morgana shoots plasma bolts at the three and overwhelming Balthazar and Veronica's shield spells, kills Balthazar when he bodily intercepts a bolt meant for Veronica. Dave makes another, larger Tesla coil out of the square's lamp posts and power lines to overwhelm her and then fires a plasma barrage, which finally destroys her. He revives Balthazar by restarting his heart with plasma shocks, and Balthazar reunites with Veronica. Dave and Becky kiss, and fly to [[France]] for breakfast on Balthazar's eagle.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Horvath retrieves his hat from Balthazar's shop.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jay Baruchel Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst 2014 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Jay Baruchel]]\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Balthazar Blake; based on [[List of Fantasia characters#Yen Sid|Yen Sid]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''<ref name=\"Spell\">{{cite news |title= Alfred Molina puts spell on 'Apprentice' |first=Borys |last=Kit |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alfred-molina-puts-spell-apprentice-80186 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= 2009-03-03 |access-date=2020-12-01 }}</ref>\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as David \"Dave\" Stutler, a nerdy but highly intelligent college student who becomes Blake's reluctant apprentice<ref name= \"Spell\" />\n** [[Jake Cherry]] as young Dave Stutler\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Maxim Horvath, an evil sorcerer and Balthazar's nemesis.
