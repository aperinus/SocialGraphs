The film is a [[remake]] of the [[The Crazies (1973 film)|1973 film of the same name]] and stars [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] and [[Danielle Panabaker]]. [[George A. Romero]], who wrote and directed the original, served as an executive producer. It is about a fictional [[Iowa]] town that becomes afflicted by a [[biological agent]] that turns those infected into violent killers. The film was released on February 26 and grossed $55 million on a $20 million budget.  The critical summary on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"tense, nicely shot, and uncommonly intelligent\", and it received mixed reviews on [[Metacritic]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa, sheriff David Dutton is enjoying a baseball game when it is interrupted by resident Rory entering the outfield with a shotgun. David attempts to dissuade him, but is forced to kill him when he raises his weapon. David's wife Judy, the community doctor, has begun to notice another resident exhibiting bizarre behavior, including lifeless and repetitive speech. The next night, a local farmer locks his wife and son inside their farmhouse and burns it down.\n\nFollowing the discovery of a pilot's body in a swamp, David and his deputy Russell investigate the area. They discover a military aircraft that crashed into the river a few days before. Suspecting a link between the contaminated water and the residents' bizarre behavior, David lobbies Mayor Hobbs to shut off the town's drinking water supply. He is denied, but does so anyway.\n\nSoon after, all communication services are lost in town and soldiers arrive to quarantine all residents at a high school. The residents are examined for symptoms of infection, and Judy does not pass the examination due to elevated temperature because of her pregnancy and is separated from David. David escapes quarantine and returns to his office, encountering Russell. The pair head for the school to free Judy. At the school, infected townspeople breach the perimeter, and the military personnel evacuate, abandoning the civilians. Judy wakes up strapped to a gurney alongside several others, and school director Ben Sandborn enters and begins killing quarantined people. David and Russell arrive and kill Ben, freeing her and Becca, Judy's assistant.\n\nUnable to find a working vehicle, the four make their way out of town on foot. They encounter Becca's boyfriend Scotty at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn their bodies. David subdues a soldier and learns that the military has been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repairs a patrol car in David's garage and are ambushed in David's house by Rory's infected wife Peggy and son Curt. Peggy stabs David in the hand before he kills her, and Russell shoots Curt through a window. Russell shoots the pair's corpses multiple times, disturbing Judy.\n\nDavid, Judy, Becca, and Russell flee in a car. On the road, they are spotted by an attack helicopter and drive into a car wash for cover. Employees at the car wash attack the car and drag Becca out by the neck with a hose, breaking her neck and killing her. When the rest of the group leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car.\n\nWhile walking down the road, the group spots a black SUV speeding toward them, which Russell disables with a police spike strip. The driver, a government employee, reveals that the cargo plane contained a Rhabdoviridae prototype and biological weapon called Trixie. It was en route to Texas to be destroyed when the plane crashed. Enraged, Russell shoots him and threatens the Duttons. David confronts him about his behavior, and Russell realizes he is infected. Russell begs to continue with them. At a military roadblock, Russell distracts the soldiers and is killed, allowing the Duttons to sneak past.\n\nDavid and Judy arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle, discovering that the military has also executed those who were evacuated. After killing more infected, they escape in a semi-truck. As they drive away, a massive explosion destroys Ogden Marsh and disables their truck, forcing them to continue on foot. A view from a military satellite highlights the couple and then the city, and the words \"Initiate containment protocol\" appear, signifying a new containment task.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, a Cedar Rapids newscaster reports on the explosion in Ogden Marsh. He says a perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area. An infected individual appears on camera before the signal is lost, implying the infection has spread to Cedar Rapids.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as David Dutton\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Judy Dutton\n* [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Russell Clank\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Becca Darling\n* [[Christie Lynn Smith]] as Deardra Farnum\n* Brett Rickaby as Bill Farnum\n* [[Preston Bailey]] as Nicholas Farnum\n* [[John Aylward]] as Mayor Hobbs\n* Joe Reegan as Private Billy Babcock\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Intelligence Officer\n* [[Larry Cedar]] as Ben Sandborn\n* [[Gregory Sporleder]] as Travis Quinn\n* Mike Hickman as Rory Hamill\n* [[Lisa K.

Director Breck Eisner's early visions of the infected were zombies. He and the makeup crew made many molds and sketches of the infected, with deformities and skin sloughing. Eventually, he grew tired of the cliche \"zombie\" look, and went with a realistic \"go under the skin,\" in which the blood vessels appear to be bursting forth and face and neck muscles and tendons tight and wrought. Eisner described this look as \"hyper alive.\"\n\nThe director's one and only rule for the makeup design\u2014they research in medical books and consult medical professionals for the design of the infected. Lead make-up artist Rob Hall said \"If we were to pitch something to Breck, about, if you know, one side of his face should look like this, Breck would immediately want to know what disease it came from, and what version of reality it could be implemented into Trixie. But the most important thing was to make sure it felt ''real''. Make it feel like you could get it, too.\" The basis of the makeup the crew used was mainly [[rabies]], [[tetanus]], and [[Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome]].\n\nEach \"Crazy\" design had about twenty-one sections requiring over three hours to apply for the final effect seen in the film. Robert stated the final effect in the film seen was not just the makeup, but the lighting, camera angles, and post-production effects. The theme for the design was \"stress.\" He stated he wanted the \"Crazies\" to look stressed. The veins and eyes were the main focus of the design. The contact lenses covered the actors' entire eyes and required eye-drops every five minutes to reduce injuries.<ref>''The Crazies'' DVD Special Feature(s): \"Paranormal Pandemics,\" \"Rob Hall make-up featurette,\" \"Behind-the-scenes with Breck Esiner\"</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered on February 24, 2010 in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36127/massive-image-gallery-the-la-crazies-premiere|title=Massive Image Gallery: The LA Crazies Premiere|date=6 August 2012 |publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> and received a wide release in the [[North America]] on February 26, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=crazies.htm | title=The Crazies (2010) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=February 14, 2009 }}</ref> The film opened at #3 behind ''[[Cop Out (2010 film)|Cop Out]]'' and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' with $16 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2010&wknd=09&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for February 26\u201328, 2010 | access-date=2010-03-01 | website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> By May 2010, the film has grossed an estimated $50 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> The Canadian DVD and Blu-ray Disc were released June 29, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36934/the-crazies-hit-canadian-dvd-and-blu-ray-june|title=The Crazies Hit Canadian DVD and Blu-ray in June|date=30 August 2012 |publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> The DVD and Blu-ray Disc + [[Digital Copy]] combo pack was released in the North America on June 29, 2010 and in the UK on July 19.<ref>[http://www.dvdactive.com/news/releases/the-crazies.html The Crazies (US - DVD R1|BD RA) in News > Releases at DVDActive]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 71% based on 148 reviews and an average rating of 6.4/10.
