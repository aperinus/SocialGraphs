A. Faura and [[Niv Fichman]]. Written by [[Javier Gull\u00f3n]], it was loosely adapted from [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]'s 2002 novel ''[[The Double (Saramago novel)|The Double]]''. The film stars [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] in a dual role as two men who are physically identical, but different in personality. [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]], [[Sarah Gadon]], and [[Isabella Rossellini]] co-star. It is an [[international co-production]] of companies from Spain, France and Canada.\n\n''Enemy'' premiered in the Special Presentation section at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September. Upon its wide release by [[A24]] on 14 March 2014, the film earned $3.4 million at the box office and received positive reviews. ''Enemy'' earned ten nominations at the [[2nd Canadian Screen Awards]], winning five, including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Villeneuve, and [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for Gadon. It was named Best Canadian Film of the Year at the [[Toronto Film Critics Association Awards 2014]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILMPLOT: summaries should be generic and MUST BE BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO NOT DO ANYTHING AT ALL TO THIS UNLESS NECESSARY! -->\n\nA man attends an erotic show at an underground club, which culminates with a naked woman on the verge of crushing a live [[tarantula]] under her platform high-heel.\n\nAdam Bell, a college history professor, lives a quiet, monotonous life in [[Toronto]]. He rents a film, ''Where There's a Will There's a Way'', on the recommendation of a colleague, and spots an actor who looks strikingly like himself, briefly, in the film as a [[bellhop]]. Searching online, Adam identifies the actor as Anthony Claire, whose stage name is Daniel Saint Claire. Adam rents the other two films in which Anthony has appeared and becomes obsessed with the man, who appears to be his physical [[twin]]. Immediately afterwards, Adam searches some boxes in his own house and finds a photo of someone who looks like himself, with a woman's hand over his shoulder. However, part of the photo is torn out, making the woman impossible to identify.\n\nAdam stalks Anthony, visiting his talent agency, where he is mistaken for Anthony and given a confidential letter. Discovering Anthony's apartment in [[Mississauga]], Adam calls the home, but reaches Anthony's pregnant wife, Helen. She also mistakes Adam's voice for Anthony's and assumes it's a joke, but Adam insists he is not Anthony. This frightens Helen, and Adam abruptly ends the call.\n\nAdam calls again later and reaches Anthony, who assumes Adam is a stalker and tells him not to call again. Helen confronts Anthony about the phone call and Adam's existence, but Anthony insists he knows nothing. Unconvinced, Helen researches Adam, discovers the college where he teaches, and finds him. Helen is visibly stunned at [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|his exact resemblance]] to her husband, though Adam does not realize who Helen is.\n\nAnthony eventually calls Adam, and they agree to meet in a hotel room, where they discover that they are perfectly identical, even having the same scar. Adam is taken aback by Anthony's direct personality, says the meeting was a mistake, and swiftly departs. The two men begin having similar dreams, or perhaps the same dream, featuring first a naked woman with a spider's head, and later a giant skyscraper-sized spider walking amidst the buildings of the city where they live.\n\nThe next day, Anthony is now stalking Adam. He sees Adam's girlfriend, Mary, whom he finds attractive. Anthony plots to accuse Adam of sleeping with his wife, and shame and manipulate Adam into letting him sleep with Mary to 'get even'. He demands Adam's clothes and car keys for a night, after which he promises to disappear forever. Adam complies. Anthony impersonates him and takes Mary to the hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, Adam goes to Anthony's apartment in retaliation, and is let inside. The building concierge desperately asks 'Anthony' to take him back to the underground sex club. Inside the apartment, Adam finds a framed photo on a shelf which looks like the one he had found earlier in his own house, but now the photo is intact, and the woman is revealed to be Helen. Adam tries to act as Anthony in front of Helen, but it appears that she recognizes his nicer demeanor. She pretends not to notice and cuddles with him. Later that night, however, Helen wakes to find Adam crying and apologizing; she tells him she prefers him and asks him to stay, then has sex with him.\n\nBack at the hotel, Mary panics during sex when she notices Anthony's wedding-ring mark and asks who he really is. Anthony claims he has always had the mark. She forces Anthony to drive her home; the two get into a fight in the car which results in a high-speed crash, presumably killing them both.\n\nThe next day, Adam dresses in Anthony's clothes and finally opens the confidential letter received earlier. He finds the key to the underground sex club, given only to select members. He resolves to go there, and tells Helen that he's going out, but she doesn't respond. As he enters the bedroom, he sees, instead of Helen, a room-sized tarantula cowering against the rear wall. Adam, with a resigned look, sighs.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Adam Bell and Anthony Claire\n*[[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as Mary\n*[[Sarah Gadon]] as Helen Claire\n*[[Isabella Rossellini]] as Mother\n*Kedar Brown as a security guard\n*Darryl Dinn as the video store clerk\n*Joshua Peace as Carl, Adam's colleague\n*Tim Post as Anthony's concierge\n*Misha Highstead, Megan Mane, Alexis Uiga as the Ladies in the Dark Room\n*Jane Moffat as Eve (uncredited)\n*[[Stephen R.

Wickman suggests that ''Enemy'' is \"a parable about what it's like to live under a totalitarian state without knowing it,\" and adds that the central irony is that even though the main character is an expert on the ways of totalitarian governments, he does not see the web that has overtaken the city until he is already stuck in it. To Wickman, ''Enemy'' suggests that this tendency to create totalitarian regimes is part of human nature, that it comes from within us,<ref name=Slate/> citing Villeneuve: <blockquote>\"Sometimes you have compulsions that you can't control coming from the subconscious \u2026 they are the dictator inside ourselves.\"<ref name=Slate>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/03/14/enemy_movie_ending_explained_the_meaning_of_the_jake_gyllenhaal_and_denis.html|title=What Should We Make of Enemy's Shocking Ending?|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=14 March 2014|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n''Enemy'' received generally positive reviews from critics, with many critics comparing the movie's style and atmosphere to the works of [[David Lynch]].
