Directed by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] (in his feature-length directorial debut) and co-directed by [[Raman Hui]], it is the third installment in the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' film series]] and the sequel to ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004).

In the plot, Prince Charming is plotting to overthrow Shrek and Fiona, who have inherited the throne following King Harold's death. Shrek, who does not want to rule the kingdom and does not believe an ogre is fit to be king, attempts to convince Fiona's underachieving, 16-year-old cousin Artie to reign instead.\n\n''Shrek the Third'' premiered at the [[Mann Village Theatre, Westwood]] in Los Angeles on May 6, 2007,<ref name=Reuters>{{cite web|last1=Tourtellotte|first1=Bob|title=Shrek box office record downplayed|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cannes-shrek-idUKL1711636420070518|publisher=Reuters|access-date=September 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915165217/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/05/18/uk-cannes-shrek-idUKL1711636420070518|archive-date=September 15, 2015|date=May 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on May 18, 2007, exactly six years after the [[Shrek|first film]] was released.

Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\n[[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and [[Princess Fiona]] are to succeed the dying King Harold, but Shrek's attempts to serve as the Regent during Harold's medical leave end in disaster. Shrek insists that an ogre as king is not ideal and that there must be someone else to rule Far Far Away. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew and Fiona's cousin, [[Arthur Pendragon (Shrek)|Arthur \"Artie\" Pendragon]]. Meanwhile, [[Prince Charming (Shrek)|Prince Charming]] vows to become King of Far Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]]. Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their \"happily ever after\".\n\nShrek, [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] set out to retrieve Artie. As they sail away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, as he believes he is not capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny, 16-year-old underachiever. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he has been chosen to be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the king's responsibilities. Losing confidence, Artie tries to take control of the ship and steer it back to Worcestershire; following a scuffle with Shrek, the ship crashes on a remote island where they encounter Artie's retired wizard teacher, [[Merlin (Shrek)|Merlin]].\n\nFiona and Queen Lillian host Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and Doris the Ugly Stepsister for a baby shower when Charming and other villains attack the castle. Gingy, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Three Little Pigs stall them long enough for Fiona to escape with the princesses and Lillian. One of the pigs accidentally reveals that Shrek has gone to retrieve Artie; Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track them down. The ladies are locked in a tower after Rapunzel betrays them, having fallen in love with Charming.\n\nHook and his pirates catch up to Shrek on Merlin's island. Shrek avoids capture, and Hook reveals Charming's takeover of Far Far Away. Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire. Instead, Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away. The spell causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. After breaking into the castle, they are caught and taken captive.\n\nCharming prepares to kill Artie to retain the crown. To save Artie's life, Shrek lies, claiming that he was just using Artie to replace him as the next king. Charming believes Shrek and allows a disheartened Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona and the ladies, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative. Lillian smashes an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a headbutt. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, and the others along with [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] and Donkey's children. Puss and Donkey mollify Artie by explaining that Shrek lied to save Artie's life.\n\nCharming stages a musical in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, Puss, and Donkey, the princesses and other fairy tale characters confront the villains, but quickly lose in a showdown. Artie shows up and gives a speech to the villains, convincing them that they can be accepted into society instead of being outcasts. The villains agree to give up their evil ways, while Charming refuses to listen and lunges at Artie with his sword. Shrek blocks the blow and it appears that he has been stabbed. Charming decrees himself the new king, but Shrek reveals that the sword missed and pushes Charming aside, while Dragon knocks the tower down onto Charming.\n\nArtie is crowned the new king. While the kingdom celebrates, Merlin reverts Puss and Donkey's body swap. The film ends with Shrek and Fiona looking after their [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia|ogre triplets]], with help from Donkey, Puss, Dragon, and Lillian.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 125\n| width2    = 125\n| width3    = 125\n| width4    = 125\n| image1    = MikeMyersJune07.jpg\n| alt1      = Mike Myers\n| image2    = CameronDiazJune07crop.jpg\n| alt2      = Cameron Diaz\n| image3    = AntonioBandaresJune07 (crop).jpg\n| alt3      = Antonio Banderas\n| image4    = JustinTimberlakeJune07 crop.jpg\n| alt4      = Justin Timberlake\n| footer    = [[Mike Myers]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] at the film's British premiere in London.\n}}\n{{See also|List of Shrek characters}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Queen Lillian (Shrek)|Queen Lillian]]\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[King Harold (Shrek)|King Harold]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[Prince Charming (Shrek)|Prince Charming]]\n* [[Eric Idle]] as [[Merlin (Shrek)|Merlin]]\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Arthur \"Artie\" Pendragon\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingerbread Man]], [[Rumpelstiltskin (Shrek)|Rumpelstiltskin]], [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as [[Pinocchio (Shrek)|Pinocchio]], the [[The Three Little Pigs (Shrek)|Three Pigs]], [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, and Felicia|Fergus]]\n* [[Larry King]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Doris|Doris the Ugly Stepsister]]\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|The Three Blind Mice]]\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as [[Snow White (Shrek)|Snow White]]\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as [[Rapunzel (Shrek)|Rapunzel]]\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as [[Cinderella (Shrek)|Cinderella]]\n* [[Aron Warner]] as [[The Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Wolf]]\n* [[Cheri Oteri]] as [[Sleeping Beauty (Shrek)|Sleeping Beauty]]\n* [[Ian McShane]] as [[Captain Hook]]\n* [[Susanne Blakeslee]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Wicked Queen|Evil Queen]]\n* [[Regis Philbin]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Mabel the Ugly Stepsister|Mabel the Ugly Stepsister]]\n* [[Mark Valley]] as Cyclops\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as the [[mangiafuoco|Puppet Master]]\n* [[John Krasinski]] as [[Lancelot]]\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Ship Captain\n* [[Tom Kane]] as Guard No. 1\n* [[Kari Wahlgren]] as Old Lady\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nFollowing the success of ''[[Shrek 2]]'', a third and fourth ''Shrek'' movie, along with plans for a final, fifth film, were announced in May 2004 by [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]: \"''Shrek 3'' and ''4'' are going to reveal other unanswered questions and, finally, in the last chapter, we will understand how Shrek came to be in that swamp, when we meet him in the first movie.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Hugh|title=Money talks for cast of Shrek 2|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1462103/Money-talks-for-cast-of-Shrek-2.html|access-date=April 15, 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=May 17, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527152753/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1462103/Money-talks-for-cast-of-Shrek-2.html|archive-date=May 27, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDreamWorks hired screenwriters [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S.
