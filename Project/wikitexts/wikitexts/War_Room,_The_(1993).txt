Directed by [[Chris Hegedus]] and [[D. A. Pennebaker]], the film was released on December 5, 1993.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film follows [[James Carville]] and [[George Stephanopoulos]], at first during the [[United States presidential election in New Hampshire, 1992|New Hampshire primary]], and then mostly in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], at the Clinton campaign headquarters. Several key events of the 1992 election cycle and their repercussions within the Clinton campaign are chronicled in the documentary. These include: the [[Gennifer Flowers]] scandal, the [[1992 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire Democratic primary]], [[Ross Perot]]'s [[Ross Perot 1992 presidential campaign|campaign]] as an Independent, the [[1992 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], the Clinton campaign's attack on [[George H. W. Bush]]'s \"[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]\" statement from 1988, the [[1992 United States presidential debates|presidential debates]], and the night of the [[1992 United States presidential election#Results|general election]].\n\nMuch of the film focuses on the interaction between politics and the media and the attempts by the Clinton and Bush campaigns to [[Spin (propaganda)|spin]] public perception of events and news stories.\n\n===People===\nThe primary characters portrayed in the film are:\n*[[Bill Clinton]], 1992 Democratic Party presidential candidate and 42nd [[Governor of Arkansas]]\n*[[James Carville]], Clinton's lead strategist\n*[[George Stephanopoulos]], Clinton's communications director\n\nThough Carville and Stephanopoulos are the film's main figures, many other prominent figures in the campaign make appearances, including [[Paul Begala]], [[Dee Dee Myers]], [[Mandy Grunwald]], Bob Boorstin, [[Stan Greenberg]], [[Mickey Kantor]], [[Harold M. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], and Bush's deputy campaign manager [[Mary Matalin]], who was in a relationship with Carville during the campaign (they married in 1993). Clinton campaign manager [[David Wilhelm]] was extended an invitation to participate, but declined. Additionally, [[Rahm Emanuel]], the future [[White House Chief of Staff]] to President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Mayor of Chicago]], can be seen in some scenes as a finance director for the Clinton campaign. Also featured are Clinton's general election rivals [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Ross Perot]], and his [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|Democratic primary]] rivals [[Paul Tsongas]] and [[Jerry Brown]].\n\n==Production==\nShortly before the 1992 Democratic National Convention, novice producers [[R.J. Cutler]] and Wendy Ettinger approached filmmakers [[D. A. Pennebaker]] and [[Chris Hegedus]] about making a documentary about the then-ongoing 1992 U.S. presidential election. Pennebaker and Hegedus expressed interest, provided the producers could get them permission to film what they would need to film, so Cutler and Ettinger contacted the Bush, Perot, and Clinton campaigns. Only the Clinton campaign was open to giving the filmmakers any access, and this was limited primarily to Carville and Stephanopoulos and events that transpired within the so-called \"war room\" at the campaign's national headquarters in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], so the scope of the film narrowed from encompassing the entire election to mostly centering around one room. Events in the election cycle that occurred before the Democratic National Convention were covered in the completed documentary through montages of newspaper headlines, the use of clips from TV news programs, and, according to Hegedus, unused footage from [[Kevin Rafferty]]'s ''Feed'', a documentary about the 1992 New Hampshire primary.<ref>The Criterion Collection (2012). \"Making The War Room: Hegedus, D.

It doesn\u2019t matter if we win. Those people are shit.
