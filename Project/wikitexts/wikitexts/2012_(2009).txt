It was produced by [[Harald Kloser]], [[Mark Gordon (film)|Mark Gordon]], and [[Larry Franco|Larry J. Franco]], and written by Kloser and Emmerich. The film stars [[John Cusack]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Oliver Platt]], [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton), [[Danny Glover]], and [[Woody Harrelson]]. Based on the [[2012 phenomenon]], its plot follows geologist Adrian Helmsley (Ejiofor) and novelist Jackson Curtis (Cusack) as they experience an [[eschatological]] sequence of events including [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, [[megatsunami]]s and a [[global flood]], all of which were imagined by subscribers to the hypothesis.\n\nFilming, planned for [[Los Angeles]], began in [[Vancouver]] in early August 2008 and wrapped up in mid-October 2008.<ref name=\"thecinemaholic.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-2012-filmed/|title = Where Was 2012 Filmed?|date = March 27, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"cusack\" /> After a lengthy advertising campaign which included the creation of a website from its main characters' point of view<ref name=\"atlantis\" /> and a [[viral marketing]] website on which filmgoers could register for a lottery number to save them from the ensuing disaster,<ref name=\"first\" /> ''2012'' was released on November 13, 2009, to commercial success, grossing over $791 million worldwide against a production budget of $200 million, becoming [[2009 in film#Highest-grossing films|the fifth highest-grossing film of 2009]]. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its visual effects, but criticism of its screenplay and runtime.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP: FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 2009, American geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist Satnam Tsurutani in [[India]] and learns that an exotic new type of [[neutrino]] from a huge [[solar flare]] is heating the [[Inner core|Earth's core]]. In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Adrian informs [[White House Chief of Staff]] Carl Anheuser, who brings him to meet [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas Wilson.\n\nIn 2010, Wilson and other world leaders begin building nine arks, each capable of carrying 100,000 people, in the [[Himalayas]] in [[Tibet]]. Nima, a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, is evacuated, and his brother Tenzin joins the ark project. Tickets are secretly sold to the rich for [[Euro|\u20ac]]1&nbsp;billion per person to fund the construction.\n\nIn 2012, struggling science-fiction writer Jackson Curtis is a [[chauffeur]] for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov. Jackson's former wife Kate and their children, Noah and Lilly, live with Kate's boyfriend, [[plastic surgeon]] and amateur pilot Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. When they enter an area fenced off by the [[United States Army]], they are caught and brought to Adrian. After being released, they meet [[conspiracy theorist]] Charlie Frost, who hosts a radio show from the park. Charlie shows Jackson his video of [[Charles Hapgood]]'s [[Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis#Earth crustal displacement hypothesis|theory]] that [[polar shift]] and the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] predict a [[2012 phenomenon]] and the end of the world. Charlie reveals that anyone attempting to inform the public was killed. The sudden departure of Yuri's sons Alec and Oleg makes Jackson realize Charlie is right. He rents a [[Cessna 340A]] to rescue his family. As the disaster unfolds, causing a massive [[earthquake]], Jackson gets his family to the airport. Gordon gets the rented plane airborne just before the coast slides into the ocean. The group flies to [[Yellowstone]] to retrieve Charlie's map of the arks' location. The Yellowstone Caldera erupts, with Charlie staying behind to finish his broadcast and dying in the eruption. The group barely escapes with Charlie's map. Realizing they need a larger plane, the group lands in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].\n\nAdrian, Carl, and First Daughter Laura fly to the arks, while President Wilson remains in Washington to address the nation. With the Vice-President's helicopter going down and the Speaker of the House missing, Carl becomes the acting commander-in-chief. Jackson runs into Yuri, Alec and Oleg, Yuri's girlfriend Tamara, and their pilot Sasha. Sasha and Gordon fly them out in an [[List of fictional aircraft#Commercial|Antonov An-500]] as the Yellowstone [[ash cloud]] envelops Las Vegas. Billions die in other ensuing disasters worldwide, including President Wilson.\n\nTheir plane runs out of fuel as they reach China. Sasha lands the jet, as the others escape in a [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Bentley Continental Flying Spur]] stored in the hold, but he is killed when the plane slides off a cliff. The others are spotted by [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] helicopters. Yuri and his sons have tickets, and are taken to the arks, but everyone else, including Tamara (due to her having an affair with Sasha) are abandoned. Nima picks them up and takes them to the arks with his grandparents. With Tenzin's help, they stow away on ark 4, assigned to the U.S.\n\nWith a large tsunami approaching, Carl orders the loading gates be closed though most people have not boarded, however, Adrian begs the captain and the other arks not to carry out the order. The loading gates are opened and the passengers quickly board the arks, but Yuri falls to his death in a canyon as he pushes his sons into the ark. As the gate is being closed, Tenzin is injured and Gordon is crushed to death in the gears. The [[impact driver]] used to access the ship gets lodged in the gears of the gate machinery, preventing the gate from closing completely, and in turn, the ship's engines from starting. As the tsunami strikes, the back of the ark is filled with water, and the ark itself is set adrift, heading for [[Mount Everest]]. Adrian rushes to clear the gears, but the flood doors close, trapping the stowaways and drowning Tamara. Jackson hears Adrian say the gears must be cleared to close the gate and start the engines, but the chamber is flooded. Jackson swims to clear the gears, with Noah following him, and together they dislodge the tool. The crew regains control of the ark just in time, while Jackson and Noah make it back safely.\n\nTwenty-seven days later, the waters start to recede. The arks approach the [[Cape of Good Hope]], where the [[Drakensberg]] mountains have now become the highest mountain range on Earth. Adrian and Laura begin a relationship, while Jackson and Kate rekindle their romance and reunite their family.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nAn alternate ending appears in the film's DVD release. After Captain Michaels (the captain of ark 4) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian learns by phone that his father, Harry, and Harry's friend Tony survived a megatsunami which capsized their cruise ship ''Genesis''. Adrian and Laura strike up a friendship with the Curtis family; Kate thanks Laura for taking care of Lily, Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book ''Farewell Atlantis'', and Jackson and Adrian have a conversation reflecting the events of the worldwide crisis. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. The ark finds the shipwrecked ''Genesis'' and her survivors on a beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-video-watch-the-alternate-ending-for-2012|title=EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Watch the Alternate Ending for '2012'!|author=Orange, B.
