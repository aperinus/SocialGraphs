It tells the story of Ren McCormack ([[Kevin Bacon]]), a teenager from [[Chicago]] who moves to a small town, where he attempts to overturn the ban on [[Dance|dancing]] instituted by the efforts of a local minister ([[John Lithgow]]).\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from the critics but became a box office hit, grossing $80 million in North America, becoming the [[1984 in film|seventh highest-grossing film of 1984]]. The film is known for its music, with the songs \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\" by [[Kenny Loggins]] and \"[[Let's Hear It for the Boy]]\" by [[Deniece Williams]] being nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->[[Chicago]] native Ren McCormack and his mother Ethel move to the small town of Bomont to live with Ren's aunt and uncle. While attending church, Ren meets Reverend Shaw Moore, his wife Vi, and daughter Ariel. Ariel recklessly endangers her life by rebelling against Shaw's strict religious nature, greatly annoying her friends and boyfriend Chuck Cranston.\n\nAt school, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, and learns the town council has banned dancing and rock music within the [[City limits|town boundary]]. He soon begins to fall for Ariel. After he and Chuck insult each other, Ren is challenged to a game of [[chicken (game)|chicken]] involving tractors, which he wins when his\nshoelace becomes stuck, preventing him from jumping. Distrusting Ren, Shaw forbids Ariel from seeing him after she shows interest in him.\n\nWanting to show his friends the joy and freedom of dance, Ren drives Ariel, Willard, and her best friend Rusty to a country bar 100 miles away from Bomont. Once there, Willard is unable to dance and gets into a jealous fight with a man who dances with Rusty. On the drive home, they cross a bridge where Ariel describes how her older brother died in a car accident while driving under the influence of alcohol after a night of dancing. The devastating accident prompted Shaw to persuade the [[town council]] to enact strict anti-liquor, anti-drug, and anti-dance laws. Ariel begins to defy Shaw's authority at home. Ren decides to challenge the anti-dancing ordinance so that the high school can hold a [[Prom|senior prom]].\n\nWillard is embarrassed he can't dance with Rusty, so Ren gives him lessons after school hours. Chuck confronts Ariel about her feelings towards Ren behind the bleachers. Provoked by his insults, Ariel throws the first punch, which Chuck retaliates to with a backhand slap, knocking her to the ground. Ariel retaliates by getting a pole and smashing Chuck's pickup. He grabs her to prevent further damage, but she continues to fight - it only ends when Chuck incapacitates her with a final punch, telling her that he \"was through with her anyway\". \n\nRen helps Ariel clean herself up before going home, cementing their relationship. Later that night, a brick with the words \"Burn in Hell\" is thrown through the window of Ren's house, causing his uncle to criticize his outspoken behavior. Ethel reveals that though Ren's actions cost her her job, he should stand up for what he feels is right.\n\nWith Ariel's help, Ren goes before the town council and reads several Bible verses to cite scriptural significance of dancing as a way to rejoice, exercise, and celebrate. Although Shaw is moved, the council votes against Ren's proposal, but Vi, who supports the movement, explains to Shaw that he cannot be everyone's father and that he is hardly being one to Ariel.\n\nDespite further discussion with Ren about his own family losses and Ariel's opening up about her own past, disclosing that she has had sexual relations, Shaw cannot bring himself to change his stance. The next day, Shaw sees members of his congregation [[book burning|burning library books]] that they claim endanger the town's youth. Realizing the situation has become uncontrollable, Shaw stops the book-burners, rebukes them, and sends them home.\n\nThe following Sunday, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom, set up at a [[grain mill]] just outside the town limits. On prom night, Shaw and Vi listen from outside the mill, dancing for the first time in years. Chuck and his friends arrive and attack Willard; Ren arrives in time to even the odds and knocks out Chuck. Ren, Ariel, Willard, and Rusty rejoin the party and happily dance the night away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- per closing credits order --->\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Ren McCormack\n* [[Lori Singer]] as Ariel Moore\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Vi Moore\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Rev.

The town had banned dancing since its founding in 1898 in an attempt to decrease the amount of heavy drinking. One advocate of the dancing ban was the Reverend from the nearby town of [[Hennepin, Oklahoma|Hennepin]], F. R. Johnson. He said, \"No good has ever come from a dance. If you have a dance somebody will crash it and they'll be looking for only two things\u2014women and booze. When boys and girls hold each other, they get sexually aroused. You can believe what you want, but one thing leads to another.\" Because of the ban on dancing, the town never held a prom. In February 1980, the junior class of Elmore City's high school made national news when they requested permission to hold a junior prom and it was granted. The request to overturn the ban in order to hold the prom was met with a 2\u20132 decision from the school board when school board president Raymond Lee broke the tie with the words, \"Let 'em dance.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.405magazine.com/June-2015/Dance-Fever-The-Town-That-Inspired-and-Got-Footloose/ |title=Dance Fever: The Town That Inspired (and Got) Footloose Oklahoma City |website=405 Magazine | date=June 2015 |orig-year=26 May 2015 (Web publication)  |access-date=2019-05-14|archive-date=2019-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502191807/https://www.405magazine.com//June-2015/Dance-Fever-The-Town-That-Inspired-and-Got-Footloose|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, [[Lynden, Washington|Lynden]], a small town in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], passed an ordinance that banned the practice of dancing at events and locations where alcohol would be served.
