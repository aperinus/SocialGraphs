The film stars [[Vin Diesel]] (who also serves as producer) as the [[Riddick (character)|title character]], and is written and directed by [[David Twohy]], who previously wrote and directed the first two installments, ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'' (2004).\n\nThe film was released on September 6, 2013, in the United States. It was shown in both conventional and [[IMAX]] Digital theaters.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after [[The Chronicles of Riddick#Plot|Kyra's death]], Riddick has become uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him; Krone causes a [[landslide]] and buries Riddick alive.\n\nRiddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg, which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: [[vulture]]-like flying animals, packs of [[jackal]]-like beasts and giant venomous [[scorpion]]-like water-dwelling Mud Demons. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After he's fully healed, Riddick notices a vast [[savanna]] beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon [[venom]] to build an [[Mithridatism|immunity]] and constructs improvised [[melee weapon]]s, as well as raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savanna. After finding a dormant mercenary station, Riddick notices a series of approaching storms, and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station, which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area.\n\nTwo ships arrive in answer to the beacon, the first led by violent and unstable Santana, with second-in-command Diaz, preacher Luna and hunters Falco, Rubio, Vargas and Nu\u00f1ez. The second, a team of professional [[mercenaries]]: leader Colonel R. \"Boss\" Johns, second-in-command and marksman Dahl, tracker Lockspur and gunner Moss. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio, Nu\u00f1ez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns' team. Riddick later steals [[Node (networking)|power node]]s from each of the teams' ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns into an ambush as Dahl shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer, and Riddick's jackal-beast is shot and killed by Santana.\n\nAt the station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the [[Pitch Black (film)#Plot|fate of his son, William]]. When the storms reach the station, Riddick's threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground, awakened by the rainwater, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick to locate the hidden power cells, but Santana attempts to kill Riddick because he is worth more dead than alive, and because Riddick promised to kill Santana if set free. Riddick, with one leg free, beheads Santana with his own machete. The group then releases Riddick on the condition he retrieve the nodes and each party gets a ship.\n\nThey fight their way to the ships, and Vargas is killed by a Mud Demon. Johns, Diaz and Riddick leave the ship together on the hoverbikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz crashes Johns' bike over an embankment; Johns is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes, Riddick reveals Johns' son's [[morphine]] addiction and attempt to use a child as bait. Diaz attacks Riddick and Johns but Riddick fights and kills him; as Diaz dies he shoots and disables the last hoverbike.\n\nRiddick and Johns fend off an endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded and Johns takes both nodes and abandons him. Riddick begins to fight the advancing Demons and climbs a rock spire; when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in a repowered ship and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Given the other ship, Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Riddick (character)|Richard B. Riddick]], last of the Furyan race and notorious criminal outlaw.  Riddick lets himself get complacent in his time as Lord Marshal and is suddenly forced to rediscover his animal side to survive.  \n* [[Matthew Nable]] as Colonel R. \"Boss\" Johns, a professional [[mercenary]] whose son William J.
