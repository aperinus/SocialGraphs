({{IPA-it|um\u02c8b\u025brto di|pron}}) is a 1952 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] film directed by [[Vittorio De Sica]]. Most of the actors were non-professional, including [[Carlo Battisti]] who plays the title role of Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a poor elderly man in [[Rome]] who is desperately trying to keep his rented room. His landlady ([[Lina Gennari]]) is evicting him and his only true friends, the housemaid ([[Maria-Pia Casilio]]) and his dog Flike (called 'Flag' in some subtitled versions of the film) are of no help.\n\nAccording to [[Robert Osborne]] of [[Turner Classic Movies]], this was De Sica's favorite of all his films. The movie was included in ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's \"All-TIME 100 Movies\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=All-Time 100 Movies|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/02/12/all-time-100-movies/#umberto-d-1952|publisher=Time Entertainment|access-date=1 Jan 2012|date=12 February 2005}}</ref> The film's sets were designed by [[Virgilio Marchi]].\n\n==Plot==\nPolice disperse an organized [[street demonstration]] of elderly men demanding a raise in their meager pensions. One of the marchers is Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired government worker.\n\nHe returns to his room and finds that his [[landlady]] has rented it out for an hour to an amorous couple. She threatens to evict Ferrari at the end of the month if he cannot pay the overdue rent, fifteen thousand lire. He sells a watch and some books, but only raises a third of the amount. The landlady refuses to accept partial payment.\n\nMeanwhile, the sympathetic maid confides in Umberto that she has her own problems. She is three months pregnant, but is unsure which of her two lovers (both soldiers) is the father, the tall one from [[Naples]] or the short one from [[Florence]].\n\nFeeling ill, Umberto gets himself admitted to a hospital. It turns out to be [[tonsillitis]] and he is discharged after a few days. When he returns to the apartment, he finds workmen renovating the entire place. The landlady is getting married. Umberto's room has a gaping hole in the wall. The maid tells him it is to become part of an enlarged living room. The maid was taking care of his dog named Flike, but a door was left open and Flike ran away.\n\nUmberto rushes to the city pound and is relieved to find his dog; however, when he makes a veiled plea for a loan to one of his friends who has a job, the friend refuses to listen. Unable to bring himself to beg from strangers on the street Umberto contemplates suicide, but knows he must first see that Flike is taken care of. He packs his belongings and leaves the apartment. His parting advice to the maid is to get rid of the boyfriend from Florence.\n\nUmberto attempts to find a place for Flike, first with a couple who board dogs, then a little girl he knows, but the latter's nanny makes her give the dog back. Flike goes to play with some children and Umberto slips away, hoping that one of them will adopt him. Despite Umberto's attempt to abandon Flike, the dog finds him hiding under a footbridge. Finally in desperation, Umberto takes the dog in his arms and walks on to a railway track as a speeding train approaches. Flike becomes frightened, wriggles free and flees. Umberto runs after him. At first Flike warily hides, but eventually Umberto coaxes Flike out to play with a pine cone. Still homeless and nearly penniless, Umberto scampers down the park lane with his dog.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Carlo Battisti]] as Umberto Domenico Ferrari\n*[[Maria-Pia Casilio]] as Maria, the maid\n*[[Lina Gennari]] as Antonio Belloni, the landlady\n*Ileana Simova as the woman in Umberto's room\n*Elena Rea as the nun at the hospital\n*[[Memmo Carotenuto]] as a patient at the hospital\n*Alberto Albari Barbieri as Antonia's friend\n*Napoleone as Flike [uncredited]\n\n==Reception==\nDe Sica said that the film was quite unpopular in Italy because it was in a period after [[World War II]] when the country was just getting back on its feet. Subsequently, they saw ''Umberto D.'' as too critical of the pride they were trying to engender in themselves.<ref name=\"lai\"/> It evoked such opposition in conservatives that [[Giulio Andreotti]], the minister responsible for cinema at the time, published an open letter against De Sica, saying that if the movie was perceived as a realistic depiction of mid-twentieth century Italy, he \"[would] have rendered a very bad service to [the] country\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gundle |first1=Stephen |editor1-last=Bondanella |editor1-first=Peter |title=The Italian Cinema Book |date=2014 |publisher=British Film Institute |location=London |isbn=978-1-84457-404-9 |page=79 |chapter=Neorealism and Left-wing Culture}}</ref> However, it was quite popular overseas and the film remained the one he was most proud of (even dedicating the film to his father).<ref name=\"lai\">{{Citation|last=Lai|first=Sandro|title=Timeless Cinema|date=2001|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5786014/|others=Giuseppe Amato, Lello Bersani, Vittorio De Sica|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview where he discussed ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', [[Ingmar Bergman]] is quoted as saying, \"''Umberto D.'' is ... a movie I have seen a hundred times, that I may love most of all.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Bergman about other filmmakers|url=http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=66DA7015-8017-4303-9A31-658D02296D45|work=Ingmar Bergman Face to Face|publisher=Ingmar Bergman Foundation|access-date=26 May 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721100149/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=66DA7015-8017-4303-9A31-658D02296D45|archive-date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/scorseses-list-of-39-essential-foreign-films.html |title=Martin Scorsese Creates a List of 39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker |publisher=Open Culture |date=15 October 2014 |access-date=1 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207201938/http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/scorseses-list-of-39-essential-foreign-films.html |archive-date=February 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] included the film in his selection of Great Movies, writing that \"Vittorio De Sica's ''Umberto D'' (1952) is the story of the old man's struggle to keep from falling from poverty into shame.
