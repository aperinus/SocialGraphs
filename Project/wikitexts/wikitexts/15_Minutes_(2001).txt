Its story revolves around a homicide [[detective]] (De Niro) and a [[New York City fire marshals|fire marshal]] (Burns) who join forces to apprehend a pair of Eastern European murderers ([[Karel Roden]] and [[Oleg Taktarov]]) videotaping their crimes in order to become rich and famous. The title is a reference to the [[Andy Warhol]] quotation, \"[[15 minutes of fame|In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes]].\"\n\n==Plot==\nEx-convicts Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul arrive in the United States to claim their part of a bank heist in [[eastern Europe]]. Oleg steals a video camera from an electronics store. At the rundown apartment of their old partner, they are denied their share of the spoils, so Emil fatally stabs the partner and his wife as Oleg tapes it with the camera. [[Czech American|Czech]] immigrant Daphne Handlova witnesses the murders from the bathroom, then escapes before Emil and Oleg can kill her as well. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment.\n\nJordy Warsaw is a New York City [[arson]] investigator assigned to the case. Also at the scene is Eddie Flemming, is a high-profile detective who is followed by his girlfriend Nicolette Karas, a reporter from the tabloid TV show ''Top Story''. Flemming and Warsaw agree to work the case together. While checking out the crowd, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention, but she disappears. Meanwhile, Emil calls an [[escort service]] and asks for a \"Czech girl.\" Oleg tapes Emil as he kills the escort and learns the address of the escort service. Oleg continually films everything, claiming he wants to be the next [[Frank Capra]].\n\nFlemming and Warsaw investigate this murder and visit the escort service. The madam, Rose Hearn, tells them that the girl Warsaw described doesn't work for her but rather a hairdresser. She mentions a couple of other guys having just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw arrive at the hair salon just after Emil and Oleg have warned Daphne to keep quiet. Flemming notices Oleg filming them from across the street. In the ensuing foot chase, Flemming's regular partner Leon Jackson is hit with a glass bottle and his wallet and gun are stolen. Emil finds a card with Flemming's name and address. He becomes jealous of Flemming's celebrity status and is convinced that anyone in America can get away with anything.\n\nOn the night Flemming plans to propose to his girlfriend Nicolette Karas, Oleg and Emil sneak into his house and bind Flemming to a chair. While Oleg is recording, Emil explains that he plans to kill Flemming and sell the tape to ''Top Story''. After getting himself committed to an [[insane asylum]], Emil will declare that he is actually sane. Since he can't be tried again, he will get off, collecting [[royalties]] from books and movies based on his crimes. Flemming attacks them with his chair (while still taped to it), but Emil gets the upper-hand and stabs him in the chest, mortally wounding him. Emil then suffocates and kills Flemming with a pillow.\n\nThe entire city is in mourning. Emil sells the tape of Flemming's murder to ''Top Story'' anchor Robert Hawkins in exchange for $1 million, outraging Warsaw and the entire police force. Emil and Oleg watch the tape's broadcast on ''Top Story'' inside a [[Planet Hollywood]]; customers realize that Emil and Oleg are sitting with them and panic. Police arrive and arrest Emil, while Oleg escapes. Warsaw takes Emil to an abandoned warehouse to kill him, but other police arrive just in time and take Emil into custody. Everything goes as planned for Emil, now a celebrity who is pleading insanity. His lawyer agrees to work for 30% of the royalties Emil will receive for his story. Meanwhile, in hiding, Oleg becomes jealous of the notoriety that Emil is receiving.\n\nWhile the lawyer is leading Emil away in court, Warsaw provokes an argument, with the ''Top Story'' crew recording the whole thing. Oleg quietly approaches Hawkins and hands him the tape of Emil explaining his plan to Flemming, proving he was sane the whole time. Hawkins shouts out to Emil about the evidence in his possession. Emil grabs a policeman's gun, shoots Oleg and grabs Nicolette, threatening to shoot her. Against orders, Warsaw shoots Emil a dozen times in the chest to avenge Flemming's murder. Hawkins rushes to Oleg's side as he dies. He attempts to get a comment from Warsaw, who punches him and walks away as the police all smile with approval.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Detective Eddie Flemming\n* [[Edward Burns]] as [[FDNY]] Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as Robert Hawkins\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Detective Leon Jackson\n* [[Melina Kanakaredes]] as Nicolette Karas\n* [[Karel Roden]] as Emil Slov\u00e1k\n* [[Oleg Taktarov]] as Oleg Razgul\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Daphne Handlova\n* [[John DiResta]] as Bobby Korfin\n* [[James Handy]] as Deputy Chief Declan Duffy\n* [[Darius McCrary]] as Detective Tommy Cullen\n* [[Bruce Cutler]] as Himself\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Rose Hearn\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Cassandra\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Detective Paulie\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as The Mugger\n* [[Vladimir Mashkov]] as Milos Karlov\n* Irina Gasanova as Tamina Karlova\n* Noelle Evans as \"Honey\"\n* [[Tygh Runyan]] as Stephen Geller\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as News Stand Vendor\n* [[Gabriel Casseus]] as Unique\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Boy In Burning Building\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] from May to July 1999.

The site's consensus reads, \"As critical as it is about sensationalism in the media, ''15 Minutes'' itself indulges in lurid violence, and its satire is too heavy-handed to be effective.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/15_minutes/|title=15 Minutes (2001)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref> It currently holds a 34 out of 100 rating on [[Metacritic]], based on 32 critical reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/15-minutes|title=15 Minutes Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it three out of four stars, calling it \"a cynical, savage satire about violence, the media and depravity.\" Ebert felt \"It doesn't have the polish of \"[[Natural Born Killers]]\" or the wit of \"[[Wag the Dog]],\" but it's a real movie, rough edges and all, and not another link from the sausage factory.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/15-minutes-2001|title=15 Minutes|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the negative side, [[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote:\n{{blockquote|For a while, as long as it's cops vs. scum, \"15 Minutes\" bangs along pretty spectacularly.

But like oh-so-many movies in today's film culture, where nobody ever met a story he could tell, this one becomes so jammed up with subplots it seems to run out of room, space and time. ... it ruins the movie, leaving it without its engine, without its rooting interest, without, really, much of anything going for it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/15minuteshunter.htm|title=15 Minutes|first=Stephen|last=Hunter|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>}}\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated: \"At the movies, we\u2019re now bamboozled into expecting not drama but sensation, and so it\u2019s no surprise that the plot of a movie like ''15 Minutes'' is less an end in itself than an excuse, a jumping-off point for showy, contrived, borderline-exploitation sequences that fail to tie together because they\u2019re not really there to do anything but sell themselves as money-shot thrills. ...
