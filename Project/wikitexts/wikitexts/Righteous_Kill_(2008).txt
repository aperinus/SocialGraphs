The film stars [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Al Pacino]] as [[New York City Police Department]] detectives on the hunt for a serial killer. It is the third film in which both De Niro and Pacino appear in starring roles (after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]''), and also stars [[John Leguizamo]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Brian Dennehy]], and [[50 Cent|Curtis Jackson]].\n\n''Righteous Kill'' was released in the United States on September 12, 2008. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $74 million against a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nPolice psychologists review recordings of a man ([[Robert De Niro]]), who states his name as Detective David Fisk, the \"Poetry Boy\" killer. The Poetry Boy earned the moniker for his [[modus operandi]] of murdering criminals and leaving short poems with their bodies. Fisk reveals that he looks up to his partner of almost 30 years, Detective Tom Cowan (whom the audience is led to believe is the character portrayed by [[Al Pacino]]), and considers him to be his role model of how a cop should be. Pacino's character is known by the nickname \"Rooster\" and De Niro's by \"Turk\", and they are referred to as such outside of the recordings.\n\nThese recordings provide a narrative, and the film opens with the tenth victim, a pimp named Robert \"Rambo\" Brady ([[Rob Dyrdek]]). Turk and Rooster investigate the murder with the less-experienced detectives Karen Corelli ([[Carla Gugino]]), Simon Perez ([[John Leguizamo]]), and Ted Riley ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]). When they find a poem on the body, the cops link it to Poetry Boy.\n\nAs Poetry Boy murders acquitted rapist Jonathan Van Luytens and Father Connell, a Catholic priest and [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] (whose victims included Poetry Boy himself), tensions escalate between Turk, Corelli, and Perez. Turk is now living with Corelli, who happens to be Perez's ex-girlfriend. Poetry Boy assaults an intended fourteenth victim, Russian mobster Yevgeny Magulat (who survives), and goes on to shoot at Perez's house and [[rape]] Corelli. Perez and Riley suspect Turk of being Poetry Boy due to his marksmanship skills and psych evaluations, so they arrange a secretly supervised meeting between Turk and suspected drug dealer Marcus \"Spider\" Smith ([[50 Cent|Curtis Jackson]]), during which Turk supposedly must kill him. Turk proves his innocence during an encounter with this drug dealer as he has the \"wrong\" gun and humiliating but obviously inappropriate poem. After Perez and Riley leave the scene unsatisfied, Rooster kills Spider. During this scrape, Rooster inadvertently drops his journal.\n\nTurk stumbles upon and reads Rooster's journal; Rooster claims Spider as Poetry Boy's fourteenth victim. Rooster puts Turk in front of a video camera and forces him to read the journal. At this point, it is revealed that the narration set Turk up as a [[red herring]], and Rooster is the actual Poetry Boy. Turk's name is actually Tom Cowan, and Rooster's is David Fisk. Rooster lost his faith in the justice system when Turk planted a gun at the house of acquitted child molester and murderer Charles Randall ([[Frank John Hughes]]), convicting him. This leads Rooster to take the law into his own hands as the vigilante serial killer known as Poetry Boy.\n\nWhen Turk finishes, he chases Rooster to a construction site. Rooster fires aimlessly to convince Turk to report that the Poetry Boy is assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, and fleeing, but Turk resists. When Rooster takes aim at Turk, Turk fires, striking Rooster in the chest. Turk calls for an ambulance, but Rooster begs Turk to let him die. After some hesitation, Turk calls off the paramedics, allowing Rooster to succumb to his wounds. He is last shown coaching a [[Police Athletic League]] baseball team as Corelli looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Detective Tom 'Turk' Cowan \n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Dave 'Rooster' Fisk\n* [[50 Cent]] (Curtis Jackson) as Marcus 'Spider' Smith\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Detective Karen Corelli\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Detective Simon Perez\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Detective Teddy Riley\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Lieutenant J.D.

The site's critics consensus reads: \"Al Pacino and Robert De Niro do their best to elevate this dowdy genre exercise, but even these two greats can't resuscitate the film's hackneyed script.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/righteous_kill/|title=Righteous Kill (2008)|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 14, 2008}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/righteouskill?part=rss|title=Righteous Kill Reviews|website=Metacritic|access-date=September 14, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Times]]'' included ''Righteous Kill'' on its 100 Worst Films of 2008 list. Keith Phipps of ''[[The Onion]]'''s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' said, \"The novelty of watching De Niro and Pacino team up wears off pretty quickly, [with them] trudging through a thriller that would have felt warmed over in 1988.

To get there, writer Russel Gewirtz and director John Avnet sacrifice mystery, suspense, sensible editing and everything else one expects to find in a police thriller just to keep the audience off-guard. It's not worth it, and the first real pairing of De Niro and Pacino is utterly wasted.\"<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/righteous-kill/review/292919 Righteous Kill Review], Ken Fox, TV Guide, 2008</ref> (The two actors had co-starred in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' without appearing on screen together and in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', sharing the screen in just two scenes.)\n\nClaudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying: \"By the time the movie reaches its protracted conclusion, it feels like a slog. Pacino has a few funny lines, as does Leguizamo, but not nearly enough to save the film from collapsing under the weight of its own self-righteous tedium.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2008-09-11-righteous-review_N.htm|title='Righteous Kill' just feels wrong|first=Claudia|last=Puig|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett]]|date=September 11, 2008|access-date=September 14, 2008}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Righteous Kill'' one star out of four, saying: \"Some people think Robert De Niro and Al Pacino would be a kick to watch just reading a phone book.
