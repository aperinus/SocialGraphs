It is the sequel to ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'' from the same year and based on the 2006 [[The Girl Who Played with Fire|novel of the same name]] by Swedish writer [[Stieg Larsson]], the second entry in his [[Millennium (novel series)|''Millennium'' series]].\n\nStarring [[Michael Nyqvist]] and [[Noomi Rapace]] in the main roles, the film follows [[Lisbeth Salander]] as she returns to Sweden after spending a year abroad. She falls under suspicion of having murdered a journalist and his girlfriend, as well as her own social services guardian, Nils Bjurman, while [[Mikael Blomkvist]] tries to find her before the authorities.\n\nThe third part of the trilogy, ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (film)|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'', was released two months later, on 27 November 2009.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lisbeth Salander]] purchases an apartment in [[Stockholm]]. On returning to Sweden after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her best friend and former partner Miriam Wu and offers her free use of her old apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts Nils Bjurman after hacking into his mail and discovering that he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen.\n\n''Millennium'' magazine welcomes Dag Svensson, a new journalist who is writing an expos\u00e9 on prostitution and [[human trafficking]] in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] on [[sex trafficking]]. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Blomkvist to inquire about someone called \"Zala,\" who may have a connection to his present research. Blomkvist arrives at their apartment and finds the two lying dead. The murder weapon is tracked to Bjurman who is also deceased. Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints happen to be on the gun. Salander tells Blomkvist that she did not kill anyone and that he needs to find the mysterious \"Zala.\"\n\nBlomkvist is contacted by Salander's boxing trainer and friend, [[Paolo Roberto]].  While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann beats him too. He then sets the barn aflame, but the two manage to escape.\n\nNews breaks of the attack, and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information that he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, \"Thank you for being my friend.\" He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander's mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box. She eventually sees someone retrieve his mail and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Reading the material in Lisbeth's apartment, Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander.\n\nIn the offices of ''Millennium'' magazine, Paolo explains that he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has [[Congenital insensitivity to pain|congenital analgesia]] which makes him unable to feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by \"Karl Axel Bodin.\" Blomkvist has Erika Berger forward documents to Bublanski and sets out to find Salander.\n\nSalander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Alexander \"Zala\" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns that she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother and that Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets.\n\nThey lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him that the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Salander digs her way out using her cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko and sticks an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko's gun as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway. Ambulances and police arrive to take away Salander and Zalachenko who are both very badly injured.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as Mikael Blomkvist\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as Lisbeth Salander\n* [[Lena Endre]] as Erika Berger\n* [[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Nils Erik Bjurman\n* [[Per Oscarsson]] as Holger Palmgren\n* [[Georgi Staykov]] as Alexander Zalachenko\n* [[Sofia Ledarp]] as Malin Eriksson\n* [[Yasmine Garbi]] as Miriam Wu\n* [[Annika Hallin]] as Annika Giannini\n* [[Tanja Lorentzon]] as Sonja Modig\n* [[Paolo Roberto]] as himself\n* [[Johan Kyl\u00e9n]] as Jan Bublanski <!-- police Inspector, lead investigator -->\n* [[Magnus Krepper]] as Hans Faste <!-- police officer -->\n* [[Ralph Carlsson]] as Gunnar Bj\u00f6rck\n* [[Micke Spreitz]] as Ronald Niedermann\n* [[Anders Ahlbom]] as Dr. Peter Teleborian\n* [[Tehilla Blad]] as young Lisbeth Salander\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Daniel Alfredson]] takes over from [[Niels Arden Oplev]], who directed ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', the first part of the trilogy.\n<!-- different director and adapter <ref name=\"chicagotribune\" /> -->\n<!-- \"originally made for television\" \nmuch more sober, scaled-down and businesslike affair than its made-for-the-big-screen predecessor. \nhttps://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/833771--the-girl-who-played-with-fire-burning-curiosity-about-lisbeth-salander \n-->\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:North Park Theatre.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Film showing at theater in [[Buffalo, New York]]]]\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, although some noted it as a step down from its predecessor.
