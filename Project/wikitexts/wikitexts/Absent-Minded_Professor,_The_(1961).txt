Taylor]], originally published in the May 22, 1943 issue of ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'' magazine. The title character was based in part on [[Hubert Alyea]], a professor emeritus of [[chemistry]] at [[Princeton University]], who was known as \"Dr. Boom\" for his explosive demonstrations. Directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]], the film stars [[Fred MacMurray]] as Professor Ned Brainard, alongside [[Nancy Olson]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[Tommy Kirk]], [[Leon Ames]], [[Elliott Reid]], and [[Edward Andrews]]. The plot follows Brainard as he invents a substance that defies gravity, which he later exploits through various means.\n\nReleased on March 16, 1961, the film was a huge success at the box office, and two years later became the first Disney film to have a sequel, ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963). It was one of the first Disney films to be [[film colorization|colorized]] (for the 1986 video release), and, along with ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'' (1959) and ''Son of Flubber'', is one of Disney's few black-and-white films to be produced after 1941. A remake entitled ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'' with [[Robin Williams]] was released in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Ned Brainard is an [[absent-minded professor]] of [[physical chemistry]] at Medfield College who invents a substance that gains energy when it strikes a hard surface. This discovery follows some blackboard scribbling in which he reverses a sign in the equation for [[enthalpy]] to energy plus pressure times volume. Brainard names his discovery ''Flubber'', which is a [[portmanteau]] of \"flying rubber.\" In the excitement of his discovery, he misses his own wedding to Betsy Carlisle, not for the first time, but his third. Subplots include another professor wooing the disappointed Miss Carlisle, Biff Hawk's ineligibility for basketball due to failing Brainard's class, Biff's father Alonzo P. Hawk's schemes to gain wealth by means of Flubber, the school's financial difficulties and debt to Mr. Hawk, and Brainard's attempts to interest the government and military in uses for Flubber. Shelby Ashton, the other professor who is interested in Betsy, is given his revenge by the Professor, who keeps on jumping on the top of Shelby's car, until it crashes into a police car, where he is given a [[field sobriety test]].\n\nLooking for backers, he bounces his Flubber ball for an audience, but his investment pitch proves so long-winded that most of the crowd has left before they notice that the ball bounced higher on its second bounce than on its first. For a more successful demonstration, he makes his [[Ford Model T|Model T]] fly by bombarding Flubber with radioactive particles. He puts Flubber on the soles of basketball players' shoes in a crucial game, giving them tremendous jumping ability; he also uses the substance himself to augment his skills during a school dance. Scheming businessman Alonzo P. Hawk becomes aware of the Professor's flying car and, at Biff's suggestion, switches it for a fake. Brianard's debut turns into a mockery when he finds himself with a fake Model T powered by squirrels and pigeons. Realizing it was Hawk's doing, Brainard plays on Hawk's greed by pointing out that, in the 60s, only 8% of the world's population uses cars, but nearly everyone wears shoes. Ned gives Hawk a pair of Flubber shoes; soon, Hawk cannot stop bouncing, and is blackmailed into revealing where he hid the Professor's car. A bouncing Hawk soon attracts everyone's attention, even a news crew, who interviews a physicist who sees Hawk keeps bouncing higher with each jump and remarks \"by 7 tonight, he's going to be in serious trouble!\". The police escort the Medfield football team to tackle Hawk on his way down, stopping his bounces. Hawk and Biff then chase after the Professor, who by now has recaptured his car. Hawk crashes into the same squad car Shelby did, and gets arrested for illegal firearms possession. Brainard convinces Betsy to accompany him to [[Washington D.C.]] Never seeing a flying car before, the military considers it an attack and is ready to open fire until one junior officer recommends against it, as Brainard is atop the [[United States Capitol]] building. Now able to convince the government of the merits of Flubber, the Professor finally marries Betsy.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor\n!

Disney told Alyea that he had given him an idea for a movie, and invited Alyea to California to give a demonstration for actor Fred MacMurray, who later mimicked Alyea's mannerisms for the film. MacMurray would later state that he had never understood chemistry until his meeting with Alyea.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/96/q4/1022alye.html |title=Official Princeton Obituary: Hubert Alyea, Innovator in Science Teaching, Dies at 93 |access-date=2011-01-10 |archive-date=2012-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019175307/http://www.princeton.edu/pr/news/96/q4/1022alye.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe special effects were created by [[Robert A. Mattey]] and [[Eustace Lycett]], who were nominated for an Academy Award, and included the sodium screen matte process, as well as miniatures and wire-supported mockups.  The film's \"Medfield Fight Song\" was written by [[Sherman Brothers|Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman]], their first song for a Disney feature.\n\n[[Keenan Wynn]] and his father [[Ed Wynn]] appear together in this film. Keenan also played Alonzo Hawk in ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963) and for a third time in ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' (1974). Keenan's son Ned also appears uncredited in a bit part.  Ed Wynn also appeared in ''Son of Flubber''.  At this stage of his life, Ed Wynn's memory was fading and he couldn't remember his lines; but he retained his innate wit and invention, so he improvised much of his dialogue, while director Stephenson instructed his crew to \"just let him go on and on.

It bothered him!  The good reviews never went to his head, but the bad reviews went to his heart.\"<ref name=\"tranberg\" />\n\nIn an interview, ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' writer [[Paul Schrader]] commented this was the first film he had ever seen.

Hewitt also returns (now as District Attorney), as well as the two Wynns (Keenan reprising his Alonzo P. Hawk role).\n\nIn 1988, the [[Disney Channel]] produced a film with the same name, which was not a remake in as much a [[spiritual sequel]]. The movie takes place again at Medfield College, where Professor Brainard is now deceased and his work has been lost to the ages. Brainard's successor as the chemistry teacher is Professor Henry Crawford, played by [[Harry Anderson]] and his girlfriend is Ellen Whitney, played by [[Mary Page Keller]], who is the English teacher. Professor Crawford has much of the same absent-minded attitude as Brainard, although he invented a computer program named \"Albert\", an avatar of [[Albert Einstein]], to help him stay on top of his responsibilities and remember appointments. Through happenstance, Crawford rediscovers the formula for flubber. Albert warns that flubber will react to [[dihydrogen monoxide]], then accesses Brainard's files and recommends Henry recreate the famous flying Model T. One scene that was tribute to the original movie was Henry's use of the flying car to fly atop the car of a rival suitor for Ellen, then bumping his roof. In 1989, another sequel was made where Henry has now married Ellen, and was offered a job by his college friend [[Ed Begley Jr.]], at a defense firm. Henry realizes a sinister purpose and must work with his friend to thwart it. That film also shown that Henry did further experiments on flubber; should it be baked in a kiln for 24 hours, it would solidify and now be impervious to liquids, and christens this upgrade \"flass\" (flying glass).\n\n===Remakes===\n''The Absent-Minded Professor'' has been remade as a 1997 theatrical film titled ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]],'' with [[Robin Williams]] as the renamed Prof. ''Philip'' Brainard, with [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as his love interest, Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Nancy Olson appears in a cameo). Neither the Anderson films nor the 1997 remake were as highly regarded as the original, but the Robin Williams version was still a considerable success. Both remakes were made in color.\n\n===Chemistry===\nSeveral rubbery chemical compounds are named [[Flubber (material)|''Flubber'']] in honor of ''The Absent-Minded Professor''{{'}}s substance.<ref>{{cite book | last=Parratore | first=Phil | title=Wacky Science: A Cookbook for Elementary Teachers | year=1998 | publisher=Kendall Hunt | location=Dubuque, Iowa | page=26 | isbn=0-7872-2741-2}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Superball]], the bouncy toy-ball invented in 1964 that is made with a [[synthetic rubber]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Wingrove, David.
