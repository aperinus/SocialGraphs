Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn 2001, one year after [[Final Destination (film)|the explosion of Flight 180]], college student [[Kimberly Corman]] is heading to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], for [[spring break]] with her friends, [[List of Final Destination characters#Shaina McKlank|Shaina McKlank]], [[List of Final Destination characters#Dano Estevez|Dano Estevez]], and [[List of Final Destination characters#Frankie Whitman|Frankie Whitman]]. While waiting on the entrance ramp to [[U.S. Route 23]], she has a [[wikt:premonition|premonition]] of a deadly pile-up caused by a [[logging truck]]. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner [[List of Final Destination characters#Evan Lewis|Evan Lewis]], mother [[List of Final Destination characters#Nora Carpenter|Nora Carpenter]] and her fifteen-year-old son [[List of Final Destination characters#Tim Carpenter|Tim]], businesswoman [[List of Final Destination characters#Kat Jennings|Kat Jennings]], stoner [[List of Final Destination characters#Rory Peters|Rory Peters]], pregnant [[List of Final Destination characters#Isabella Hudson|Isabella Hudson]], high school teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Eugene Dix|Eugene Dix]], and Deputy Marshal [[List of Final Destination characters#Thomas Burke|Thomas Burke]]. While Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs, but Shaina, Dano, and Frankie are killed by a [[Car carrier trailer|car carrier]] after Burke saves Kimberly at the last second.\n\nAfter the survivors are questioned at the police station, Evan is fatally impaled by a fire escape ladder while attempting to escape from a fire in his apartment. Aware of [[Death (personification)|Death]]'s presence, Kimberly seeks help from [[Clear Rivers]], the last survivor of Flight 180 who committed herself to a psychiatric ward for protection after [[Alex Browning]] was killed by a falling brick. When Kimberly informs Clear that Evan was the first of the highway survivors to die, unlike in her premonition, Clear realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse order. Meanwhile, Tim is crushed by a windowpane while leaving the dentist with his mother. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Burke to [[William Bludworth]], who tells them that only new life can defeat Death. Believing that the birth of Isabella's baby would disrupt Death's plan, Burke sends fellow marshal Steve Adams to take her into custody while he gathers the other survivors in his apartment. When Nora decides to leave, a chain of accidents results in her head becoming trapped in an elevator, decapitating her.\n\nThe survivors take Kat's SUV to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor, prompting Adams to rush her to the hospital. Along the way, the survivors realize that the demises of the Flight 180 survivors affected all of their lives even before the highway pile-up by saving them from prior deaths, which inverted the sequence of the concurring accident. The SUV then suffers a blowout, causing them to swerve into a stack of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipes in a farm that penetrate the car and injure Eugene. Rescue workers arrive and assist the farm owners, the Gibbons family, with rescuing the others while Eugene is hospitalized. Using the [[Hydraulic rescue tools#Shears|Jaws of Life]], Kat's rescuer accidentally activates her airbag, causing her head to be impaled on a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls onto a gasoline leak from a news van that explodes, launching a barbed wire fence into the air that dismembers Rory.\n\nGuided by a vision of a doctor named [[List of Final Destination characters#Ellen Kalarjian|Kalarjian]] who Kimberly believes will euthanize Isabella; she, Clear, and Burke rush to a hospital to save her but while Isabella and her baby are safe, Kimberly sees through her premonition that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up at all. At the same time, an explosion from an oxygen leak in Eugene's ward kills both Clear and Eugene. Kimberly realizes that the vision from the hospital was hers, deducing from an article of a survivor creating \"new life\" to defeat Death. To ensure Burke's safety, she drives into a lake to drown herself, but Burke saves her and she is revived by Dr. Kalarjian.\n\nLater, Kimberly and Burke have a picnic with the Gibbons and [[List of Final Destination characters#Michael Corman|Kimberly's father]]. The Gibbons explain that their son [[List of Final Destination characters#Brian Gibbons|Brian]] was nearly hit by a news van on the day of the accident, but Rory saved him. As Kimberly and Burke realize the implications, Brian is suddenly killed in an explosion caused by a malfunctioning barbecue grill.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

They didn't want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn't want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come.

CG supervisor Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. \"They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG,\" Crosby indicated. \"It began with R&D on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through [[windshields]] killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role.\"\n\nSenior [[technical director]] James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. [[Digital artist]] Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also used for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. [[Physics]] such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a [[Douglas-fir]] were also considered.<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\nIn spite of this, there are no CG cars incorporated in the actual film. \"It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but when they were done shooting they didn't end up needing any CG cars,\" Crosby avowed.<ref name=\"CG\" /> Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting.<ref name=\"Landes\" /><ref name=\"CG\" /> Landes experienced [[claustrophobia]] during the procedure.<ref name=\"Landes\" /> [[Fake blood]] was also used, but CG blood was also shown.<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\n===Music===\n\n====Soundtrack====\nLike its predecessor, no official album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs featured in the film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release.<ref name=\"Ezy\">{{cite news |last=Ezy Properties Limited |first=Ezy DVD Australia |title=''Final Destination 2'' |url=http://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/final-destination-2/dp/223590 |access-date=May 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103153037/http://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/final-destination-2/dp/223590 |archive-date=January 3, 2012}}</ref> Two singles of [[The Sounds]], ''Dance with Me'' and ''Rock 'n Roll'', were promoted on Kimberly's [[car stereo]].<ref name=\"Songs\">{{cite news |last=Music from Film |first=Music From Film |title=Music from ''Final Destination 2'' |url=http://musicfromfilm.com/movies/finaldestination2.php |access-date=May 16, 2012}}</ref> Besides these, the music video of ''Seven Days a Week'' accompanied the film's DVD.<ref name=\"Ezy\" /> ''Middle of Nowhere'' by [[The Blank Theory]] was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video.<ref name=\"Ezy\" /><ref name=\"Songs\" /> ''[[Rocky Mountain High]]'' by [[John Denver]] was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal.<ref name=\"Songs\" /> Christodal also performed ''My Name is Death'' during Brian's death and the end credits.
