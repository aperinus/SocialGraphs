The [[screenplay]] by [[Ronald Harwood]] is based on the novel ''[[Theatre (novel)|Theatre]]'' (1937) by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. The original [[film score]] was composed by [[Mychael Danna]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[London]] in 1938, the film focuses on highly successful and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert, whose gradual disillusionment with her career as she approaches middle age has prompted her to ask her husband, [[stage director]] Michael Gosselyn, and his financial backer Dolly de Vries to close her current production to allow her time to travel abroad. They persuade her to remain with the play throughout the summer. Michael introduces her to Tom Fennel, an enterprising American, who confesses his deep appreciation of her work. Seeking the passion missing from her marriage, and anxious to fill the void left when her close friend Lord Charles suggested they part ways to avoid scandalous gossip, Julia embarks on a passionate affair with the young man and begins to support him so he may enjoy the glamorous lifestyle to which she has introduced him. Their relationship revives her, sparking a distinct change in her personality. Always hovering in the background and offering counsel is the spirit of her mentor, Jimmie Langton, the theatrical manager who gave Julia her start and made her a star, while flesh-and-blood Evie serves as her personal maid, dresser, and confidante.\n\nMichael suggests they invite Tom to spend time at their country estate, where he can become better acquainted with their son Roger. At a party there, Tom meets aspiring actress Avice Crichton, and, when Julia sees him flirting with the pretty young woman, she becomes jealous and anxious and angrily confronts him. He slowly reveals himself to be a callous, social-climbing, gold-digging [[gigolo]], and Julia is shattered when their affair comes to an end.\n\nAvice, now romantically involved with Tom, asks him to bring Julia to see her perform in a play in the hope the actress will induce her husband to cast her in a supporting role in Julia's upcoming project. The play is dreadful, and Avice is not much better. Backstage, Julia compliments her even-worse co-star and barely acknowledges Avice, although she promises to tell Michael about her. Afterwards, she forces Tom to admit he loves Avice, then - although her heart is broken by his admission - she assures him she will insist the [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] be cast in her next play.\n\nWhen Julia's performance in her current play begins to suffer from her personal discontent, Michael closes the production, so Julia visits her mother and her Aunt Carrie in [[Jersey]], where Lord Charles comes to visit her. Julia suggests a romantic tryst, and he gently tells her that he's [[gay]]. Meanwhile, back in London, Avice auditions for Michael. Although Julia resents it, she is given the role.\n\nJulia returns home to begin rehearsals for the new play. Shortly after, she learns from her son that Avice has been one of Michael's casual trysts. Still, she is uncharacteristically solicitous toward the girl, making suggestions that place her in the spotlight and insisting her own wardrobe be drab to allow Avice to shine. What her director and fellow cast members don't realize is there's a method to her seeming [[Insanity|madness]] - Julia has planned her sweet revenge for the opening night performance, during which she successfully affirms her position as London theatre's foremost [[diva]] by upstaging every aspect of Avice's performance.\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in June 2003. Exteriors were shot on location in London and Jersey. Interiors were filmed in [[Budapest]], including inside the [[Danubius Hotel Astoria]], and [[Kecskem\u00e9t]] in [[Hungary]].\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] features a number of popular songs of the era, including \"[[They Didn't Believe Me]]\" by [[Jerome Kern]] and Herbert Reynolds; \"[[Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries]]\" by [[Lew Brown]] and [[Ray Henderson]]; \"[[Mad About the Boy]]\" by [[No\u00ebl Coward]]; \"[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]\" by [[Cole Porter]]; \"She's My Lovely\" by [[Vivian Ellis]]; \"[[Bei Mir Bist Du Schon]]\" by [[Sholom Secunda]], Jacob Jacobs, [[Sammy Cahn]], and [[Saul Chaplin]]; and \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" by [[Otto A. Harbach]] and Jerome Kern.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]], the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]], the Calgary Film Festival, and the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] before opening in the US in limited release.\n\nThe film grossed $14,339,171 at the box office.<ref>[https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beingjulia.htm ''Being Julia'' at BoxOfficeMojo.com]</ref>\n\n=== Differences from the novel ===\n\nThe film omits much of Julia's recollections of her life and career with Michael and her previous affair with a Spaniard whose name she never knows. In the original story she meets Lord Charles when his wife attempts to insult her by bringing up her \"common\" origins. Although Julia's retort is the same in the film this scene occurs after she has already met Charles and the attempted insult is made by someone who is not married to him. Charles in the film is not married at all and turns out to be a [[He never married|confirmed bachelor]].\n\nIn novel, Julia has to convince Michael to keep the lackluster Avice Crichton in the play in order to exact her revenge on her. In the adaptation, Michael is having a fling with her.\n\nJimmie Langton also often appears as a figment of Julia's imagination giving advice or reacting to her actions, a device which is not present in the original story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Julia Lambert\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Michael Gosselyn\n* [[Shaun Evans]] as Tom Fennel\n* [[Lucy Punch]] as Avice Crichton\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Evie\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Dolly de Vries\n* [[Tom Sturridge]] as Roger Gosselyn\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Lord Charles\n* [[Rosemary Harris]] as Julia's Mother\n* [[Rita Tushingham]] as Aunt Carrie\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Jimmie Langton\n}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Being Julia'' has received fairly positive reviews, with Bening receiving acclaim for her performance, and an average score of 65/100 at the review aggregator [[Metacritic]], based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/being-julia|title=Being Julia Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=22 February 2011}}</ref> The film also has an approval rating of 76% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 123 reviews, and an average rating of 6.70/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Annette Bening delivers a captivating performance in ''Being Julia'', a sophisticated comedy that follows a 1930s stage diva who experiences an identity crisis at age 40\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/being_julia|title = Being Julia (2004)|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott called the film \"a flimsy frame surrounding a brightly colored performance by Annette Bening, whose quick, high-spirited charm is on marvelous display . . . She gives ''Being Julia'' a giddy, reckless effervescence that neither Mr. Szabo's stolid direction nor Ronald Harwood's lurching script . . . are quite able to match . . . Ms. Bening walks right up to the edge of [[melodrama]]tic [[bathos]] (the hallmark of the kind of plays in which Julia stars) and then, in a wonderful climactic coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, turns it all into [[farce]]. ''Being Julia'' may not make much psychological or dramatic sense, but Ms. Bening, pretending to be Julia (who is always pretending to be herself), is sensational.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2004/10/15/movies/15juli.html ''The New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said, \"Annette Bening plays Julia in a performance that has great verve and energy, and just as well, because the basic material is wheezy [[melodrama]]. ''[[All About Eve]]'' breathed new life into it all those years ago, but now it's gasping again . . . I liked the movie in its own way, while it was cheerfully chugging along, but the ending let me down; the materials are past their sell-by date and were when Maugham first retailed them. The pleasures are in the actual presence of the actors, Bening most of all, and the droll Irons, and Juliet Stevenson as the practical aide-de-camp, and Thomas Sturridge, so good as Julia's son that I wonder why he wasn't given the role of her young lover.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041028%2FREVIEWS%2F40922005%2F1023 |title=''Chicago Sun-Times'' review |access-date=2022-03-03 |archive-date=2013-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107051420/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041028%2FREVIEWS%2F40922005%2F1023 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Carla Meyer described the film as \"a one-woman show\" and added, \"There are several notable actors in it, most of them quite good, but it's the glorious Annette Bening who hoists this flawed production on her mink-wrapped shoulders and makes it work . . . Her stage background at [[American Conservatory Theater]] shows in her multilayered tour de force.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/22/DDGRH9D3MM1.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, \"Annette Bening has fun running the vast gamut of her emotions, be they authentic or manufactured. But Istvan Szabo's new film, like the W. Somerset Maugham novel upon which it's based, is a minor affair, a confection based on dalliances and the way a set of sophisticated theater people handle them, that lacks true distinction . . . Working in a much lighter vein than usual, Szabo has said he studied the films of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and [[Billy Wilder]] in preparation for this picture. Unfortunately, ''Being Julia'' has little to do with the specifically [[Vienna|Viennese]] strain of wise and winkingly cynical romantic comedy perfected by those two masters of the sexual charade and nearly everything to do with the world of pre-war London theater. This is a film that, above all else, needed to be steeped in Britishness, in the very particular mores and manners of the time; as a Canadian production mostly shot in Budapest by a Hungarian director and an American star and a number of [[Canuck]] thesps, this just doesn't happen. The deficiencies may be intangible, but they deprive film of the solid footing it requires . . . The majority of the seriocomic doings, while superficially diverting, provide neither indelible wit nor the gravitas of a genuinely meaningful comedy of manners (see [[Oscar Wilde]]), leaving a relatively wispy impression in its wake.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117924825.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=Being+Julia ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and commented, \"Annette Bening can act - watch ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' or ''[[Bugsy]]'' or ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' - but she works too hard to prove it in ''Being Julia'' . . . Director Istvan Szabo overplays his hand and traps [her] in a role that's all emoting, no emotion.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/being-julia-20041006 ''Rolling Stone'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Mark Kermode]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' said, \"Annette Bening makes a claim for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination . . . Chewing up the scenery in lipsmacking form, she savours the ribald dialogue like an overripe wine, spitting venom and self-pity in equally bilious measures, lending much needed weight to this contrived fluff.\"<ref>[http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1355870,00.html ''The Observer'' review]</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (Annette Bening, nominee)\n* [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] (Bening, '''winner''')\n* [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role - Motion Picture]] (Bening, nominee)\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture#Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (1996\u20132010, 2018\u2013present)|Satellite Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] (Bening, '''winner''')\n* [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture#Musical or Comedy (1996\u20132005)|Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] (Jeremy Irons, nominee)\n* [[Genie Award for Best Motion Picture]] (nominee)\n* [[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Bruce Greenwood, nominee)\n* [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actress]] (Bening, '''winner''')\n* [[London Film Critics Circle|London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] (Bening, nominee)\n* [[2005 Bangkok International Film Festival|Bangkok International Film Festival Golden Kinnaree Award for Best Actress]] (Bening, '''winner'''; tied with [[Ana Geislerova]] for ''[[\u017delary]]'')\n* Bangkok International Film Festival Golden Kinnaree Award for Best Film (nominee)\n* [[European Film Awards|European Film Award for Best Director]] (nominee)\n* European Film Award for Best Cinematography (nominee)\n* Southeastern Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress (Bening, '''winner''')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.beingjuliamovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0340012|Being Julia}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|being_julia}}\n* {{Allmovie title|290203|Being Julia}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Being Julia}}\n\n{{Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:English-language Hungarian films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by W.
