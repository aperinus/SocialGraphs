In custody, he strangles a deputy sheriff and uses a [[captive bolt pistol]] to kill a stranger on the highway and escape in his car. He spares the life of a [[gas station]] owner who correctly guesses the result of Chigurh's [[coin flipping|coin toss]].\n\nHunting [[pronghorn]]s in the desert, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He finds several dead men and dogs, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, drugs in the vehicle, and two million dollars in a briefcase. He takes the money and returns home. Feeling guilty, Moss returns with water but finds the man dead. Two men in a truck pursue him, but he escapes into a river. Reaching home, he sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother, then drives to a motel in [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]], where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct.\n\nChigurh, hired to recover the money, arrives to search Moss's home, where he uses his bolt pistol to blow the lock out of the door. Investigating the break-in, [[Terrell County, Texas|Terrell County]] Sheriff Ed Tom Bell observes the blown-out lock. Following a tracking device in the money, Chigurh goes to Moss's motel room and kills a group of Mexicans, waiting to ambush Moss, with his [[shotgun]]. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans' room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct.\n\nMoving to a hotel in the border town of [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, killing a bystander and wounding both. Moss flees across to Mexico, stashing the case of money along the Rio Grande. Finding Moss severely injured, a passing [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o band]] takes him to a hospital. Carson Wells, another hired operative, fails to persuade Moss to accept protection in return for the money. Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and sneaks up on Wells at his hotel. Unsuccessfully bartering for his life, Wells is murdered by Chigurh. Moss telephones the room, and Chigurh vows to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money.\n\nMoss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in [[El Paso]], where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean is approached by Sheriff Bell, who promises to protect Moss. Carla Jean's mother unwittingly reveals Moss's location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel rendezvous at El Paso, only to hear gunshots and spot a pickup truck speeding from the motel. In the parking lot, Bell finds Moss dead, as does a later arriving Carla Jean.\n\nThat night, Bell returns to the crime scene and observes the lock blown out. Chigurh appears to hide behind the door of the room, but when Bell hesitantly enters, he finds the room empty. He sees the vent cover removed. Later, Bell visits his uncle Ellis, an ex-lawman, and tells him he plans to retire because he feels \"overmatched\" by the recent violence. Ellis replies that the region has always been violent.\n\nWeeks later, Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom, per his threat to Moss. She refuses his offer of a coin toss for her life, stating that he cannot pass blame to luck: the choice is his. <!--DO NOT WRITE that this is left unresolved or that he kills her or whatever you think happened here. Just describe what the film shows us and let readers interpret it.--> Chigurh checks his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, a car crashes into his at an intersection and injures him. He bribes two young witnesses for their silence and flees.\n\nNow retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, he and his father were riding through a snowy mountain pass; his father had gone ahead to make a fire in the darkness and wait for Bell.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Ed Tom Bell\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as [[Anton Chigurh]]\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Llewelyn Moss\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Carson Wells\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Carla Jean Moss\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as Wendell\n* [[Tess Harper]] as Loretta Bell\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Ellis\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Man who hires Wells\n* [[Rodger Boyce]] as El Paso Sheriff\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Carla Jean's mother\n* Ana Reeder as Poolside Woman\n* [[Josh Blaylock]] and [[Caleb Landry Jones|Caleb Jones]] as Boys on Bikes\n* [[Gene Jones (actor)|Gene Jones]] as Gas Station Proprietor\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe role of Llewelyn Moss was originally offered to [[Heath Ledger]], but he turned it down to spend time with his newborn daughter Matilda.<ref name=\"Indiewire\">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/11/5-things-you-should-know-about-the-making-of-no-country-for-old-men-104246/|title=5 Things You Should Know About The Making of 'No Country For Old Men'|date=November 9, 2012 |publisher=Indiewire.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> Garret Dillahunt was also in the running for the role of Llewelyn Moss, auditioning five times for the role,<ref name=\"Indiewire\" /> but instead was offered the part of Wendell, Ed Tom Bell's deputy.

Joel Coen said that the book's unconventional approach \"was familiar, congenial to us; we're naturally attracted to subverting genre. We liked the fact that the bad guys never really meet the good guys, that McCarthy did not follow through on formula expectations.\"<ref name=\"turan\" /><ref>{{cite magazine| authors=Fleming, Michael |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117928172.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|title=Rudin books tyro novel|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 28, 2005|access-date=December 23, 2007}}</ref> Ethan Coen explained that the \"pitiless quality\" was a \"hallmark of the book, which has an unforgiving landscape and characters but is also about finding some kind of beauty without being sentimental.\" The adaptation was the second of McCarthy's work, following ''[[All the Pretty Horses (film)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite news| author=Thomas, Nicholas Addison|title=A mesmerizing tale of desperation|newspaper=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date= October 9, 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe Coens' script was mostly faithful to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, \"One of us types into the computer while the other holds the spine of the book open flat.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Still, they pruned where necessary.<ref name=\"turan\" /> A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed.<ref name=\"evil\">{{cite news| author=Phillips, Michael|title=Coen brothers revisit Unstoppable Evil archetype|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 21, 2007}}</ref> Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, \"the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's been through so much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it.\"<ref name=\"macdonald\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canmag.com/nw/9642-no-country-for-old-men-kelly-macdonald |last=Topel |first=Fred |title=Kelly MacDonald on ''No Country for Old Men'' |work=CanMag}}</ref> In the book, there is also some attention paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts.\n\n[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that \"the Coen brothers have adapted literary works before. ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'' was a sly, unacknowledged blend of two [[Dashiell Hammett]] tales, ''[[Red Harvest]]'' and ''[[The Glass Key]]''; and ''[[O Brother Where Art Thou?]]'' transferred ''The [[Odyssey]]'' [of [[Homer]]] to the American south in the 1930s. But ''No Country for Old Men'' is their first film taken, pretty straightforwardly, from a [contemporary] prime American novel.\"<ref name=\"Corliss-Coens\">{{cite magazine|url=https://time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1623326,00.html#ixzz1pojdxnlf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521105733/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1623326,00.html#ixzz1pojdxnlf|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 21, 2007|last= Corliss|first= Richard|title= CANNES JOURNAL: Three Twisty Delights |magazine= Time| date=May 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe writing is also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin discussed his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: <blockquote>I mean it was a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? ... Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You have to figure out different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.<ref name=\"aboutbrolin\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the novel adaptation. \"Not since [[Robert Altman]] merged with the short stories of [[Raymond Carver]] in ''[[Short Cuts]]'' have filmmakers and author fused with such devastating impact as the Coens and McCarthy. Good and evil are tackled with a rigorous fix on the complexity involved.\"<ref name=\"Travers-Rolling Stone\" />\n\nDirector Joel Coen justified his interest in the McCarthy novel. \"There's something about it&nbsp;\u2013 there were echoes of it in ''No Country for Old Men'' that were quite interesting for us\", he said, \"because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story. Because you only saw this person in this movie making things and doing things in order to survive and to make this journey, and the fact that you were thrown back on that, as opposed to any dialogue, was interesting to us.\"<ref name=\"Time-Conversation\">{{cite magazine|url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1673269,00.html#ixzz1qsmzGiiC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023031342/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1673269,00.html#ixzz1qsmzGiiC|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 23, 2007| last= Grossman|first= Lev|title= A conversation between author Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, about the new movie No Country for Old Men|magazine= Time| date=October 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nCoen stated that this is the brothers' \"first adaptation\". He further explained why they chose the novel: \"Why not start with Cormac? Why not start with the best?\" He further described this McCarthy book in particular as \"unlike his other novels ... it is much pulpier.\" Coen stated that they have not changed much in the adaptation. \"It really is just compression,\" he said. \"We didn't create new situations.\" He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, \"he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening room with him when he saw it ... and I heard him chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously.\"<ref name=\"Charlie Rose\">{{cite web|url=https://charlierose.com/view/interview/8783|title=An interview with Charlie Rose: A discussion about the film No Country for Old Men with filmmakers and brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and actors Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem, November 16, 2007, (mm:ss 02:50, 18:40, 20:50, 21:50, 29:00)|publisher=charlierose.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215192136/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/8783|archive-date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Title ====\nThe title is taken from the opening line of the 20th-century Irish poet [[William Butler Yeats]]' poem \"[[Sailing to Byzantium]]\":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/vintage/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375706677&view=rg|title=Vintage Catalog \u2013 No Country for Old Men|publisher=Random House|access-date=November 10, 2008}}</ref>\n{{poemquote|That is no country for old men.

It is also a lament for the way the young neglect the wisdom of the past and, presumably, of the old&nbsp;... Yeats chooses [[Byzantium]] because it was a great early Christian city in which [[Academy#Plato's Academy|Plato's Academy]], for a time, was still allowed to function. The historical period of Byzantium was a time of culmination that was also a time of transition. In his book of mystical writings, ''[[A Vision]]'', Yeats says, \"I think that in early Byzantium, maybe never before or since in recorded history, religious, aesthetic, and practical life were one, that architect and artificers&nbsp;... spoke to the multitude and the few alike.\" The idea of a balance and a coherence in a society's religious, aesthetic, and practical life is Yeats's ideal&nbsp;... It is an ideal rarely realized in this world and maybe not even in ancient Byzantium. Certainly within the context of the movie ''No Country for Old Men'', one has the sense, especially from Bell as the chronicler of the times, that things are out of alignment, that balance and harmony are gone from the land and from the people.<ref name=\"Conard\" />}}\n\n==== Differences from the novel ====\nCraig Kennedy adds that \"one key difference is that of focus. The novel belongs to Sheriff Bell. Each chapter begins with Bell's narration, which dovetails and counterpoints the action of the main story. Though the film opens with Bell speaking, much of what he says in the book is condensed and it turns up in other forms.

Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth.\"<ref name=\"Jay Ellis-2\">Spurgeon, Sara L.

It's that order of planning. And we only shot 250,000 feet, whereas most productions of that size might shoot 700,000 or a million feet of film. It's quite precise, the way they approach everything. ... We never use a zoom,\" he said. \"I don't even carry a zoom lens with me, unless it's for something very specific.\" The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. \"When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention.

The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel to go with the idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer, [[Carter Burwell]], but after finding that \"most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind ... he used [[singing bowl]]s, standing metal bells traditionally employed in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] meditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed.\" The movie contains a \"mere\" 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called \"Diabolic Clockwork\" by [[Two Steps from Hell]]. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator, [[Skip Lievsay]], who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix. The [[Sound effect#Film|foley]] for the captive bolt pistol used by Chigurh was created using a pneumatic nail gun.<ref name=\"NYT-Sound\">{{cite news| author=Lim, Dennis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06lim.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ref=todayspaper|title=Exploiting Sound, Exploring Silence|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 6, 2008|access-date=March 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Lane]] of ''The New Yorker'' states that \"there is barely any music, sensual or otherwise, and Carter Burwell's score is little more than a fitful murmur\",<ref name=\"Anthony Lane\">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2007/11/12/071112crci_cinema_lane#ixzz1q2GuveqZ|last= Lane|first= Anthony|title= Hunting Grounds \"No Country for Old Men\" and \"Lions for Lambs\" |magazine= The New Yorker| date=November 12, 2007}}</ref> and Douglas McFarland states that \"perhaps [the film's] salient formal characteristic is the absence, with one telling exception, of a musical soundtrack, creating a mood conducive to thoughtful and unornamented speculation in what is otherwise a fierce and destructive landscape.\"<ref name=\"Conard2\">Conard, Mark T.

But it is there, telling our unconscious that something different is occurring with the toss; this becomes certain when it ends as Chigurh uncovers the coin on the counter. The deepest danger has passed as soon as Chigurh finds (and Javier Bardem's acting confirms this) and reveals to the man that he has won.\"<ref name=\"Jay Ellis\">Spurgeon, Sara L. (2011), Part 2, Chapter 5: ''Levels of Ellipsis in No Country for Old Men'', p. 100, by Ellis, Jay.</ref> In order to achieve such sound effect, Burwell \"tuned the music's swelling hum to the 60-hertz frequency of a refrigerator.\"<ref name=\"NYT-Sound\" />\n\nDennis Lim of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stressed that \"there is virtually no music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In some of the most gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence.\" Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach \"quite a remarkable experiment,\" and added that \"suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea here was to remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. I think it makes the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone.\"<ref name=\"NYT-Sound\" />\n\nJames Roman observes the effect of sound in the scene where Chigurh pulls in for gas at the ''Texaco'' rest stop. \"[The] scene evokes an eerie portrayal of innocence confronting evil,\" he says, \"with the subtle images richly nuanced by sound. As the scene opens in a long shot, the screen is filled with the remote location of the rest stop with the sound of the ''Texaco'' sign mildly squeaking in a light breeze. The sound and image of a crinkled cashew wrapper tossed on the counter adds to the tension as the paper twists and turns. The intimacy and potential horror that it suggests is never elevated to a level of kitschy drama as the tension rises from the mere sense of quiet and doom that prevails.\"<ref name=\"J.

And that has as much to do with what we ''hear'' as what we ''see''. ''No Country for Old Men'' lacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war.

There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice at the beginning of the film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table\u2014a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell ([[Garret Dillahunt]]), only just missed their man\u2014this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both.\"<ref name=\"De Boever\">{{cite journal |last1=De Boever |first1=Arne |title=The Politics of Retirement: Joel and Ethan Coen's ''No Country for Old Men'' after September 11 |journal=Image & Narrative |date=2009 |volume=X |issue=2 |url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/l_auteur_et_son_imaginaire/DeBoever.htm |access-date=16 February 2020 |issn=1780-678X}}</ref>\n\n=== Depicted violence ===\nIn an interview with [[Charlie Rose]], co-director Joel Coen acknowledged that \"there's a lot of violence in the book,\" and considered the violence depicted in the film as \"very important to the story\". He further added that \"we couldn't conceive it, sort of soft pedaling that in the movie, and really doing a thing resembling the book ... it's about a character confronting a very arbitrary violent brutal world, and you have to see that.\"<ref name=\"Charlie Rose\" />\n\n''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Kenneth Turan]] commented on the violence depicted in the film: \"The Coen brothers dropped the mask. They've put violence on screen before, lots of it, but not like this. Not anything like this. ''No Country for Old Men'' doesn't celebrate or smile at violence; it despairs of it.\" However, Turan explained that \"no one should see ''No Country for Old Men'' underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and [[Cormac McCarthy|McCarthy]] are not interested in violence for its own sake, but for what it says about the world we live in ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined. And in this despairing vision, neither does anyone else.\"<ref name=\"NPR-Turan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16143451| last= Montagne| first= Renee|title= Violence Overwhelms 'No Country'|publisher= NPR| date=November 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[NPR]] critic [[Bob Mondello]] adds that \"despite working with a plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a character check the soles of his boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in ''No Country for Old Men'' that they don't have to show you what he's checking for.\"<ref name=\"NPR-Mondello\">{{cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16127422| last= Mondello| first= Bob|title= 'Country' Boys: Coen Brothers Out for Blood Again |publisher= NPR| date=November 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nCritic Stephanie Zacharek of [[Salon (website)|Salon]] states that \"this adaptation of [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, the kind of thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points&nbsp;\u2013 that's nothing new&nbsp;\u2013 but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. ''No Country for Old Men'' feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town.\"<ref name=\"Salon-Zacharek\">{{cite web|url= https://www.salon.com/2007/10/05/no_country/|last= Zacharek|first= Stephanie|title=\"No Country for Old Men\": Movie review |website= Salon| date=October 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\nRyan P. Doom explains how the violence devolves as the film progresses. \"The savagery of American violence,\" he says, \"begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates the level of the Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers. ... .Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During the first half of the film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [boots] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again.\"<ref name=\"Doom\">Doom, Ryan P. (2009), Chapter 12: \"The Unrelenting Country: 'No Country for Old Men (2007)'\", p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== Similarities to earlier Coen brothers films ===\nRichard Gillmore states that \"the previous Coen brothers movie that has the most in common with ''No Country for Old Men'' is, in fact, ''[[Fargo (1996 film)|Fargo]]'' (1996). In ''Fargo'' there is an older, wiser police chief, Marge Gunderson ([[Frances McDormand]]) just as there is in ''No Country for Old Men''. In both movies, a local police officer is confronted with some grisly murders committed by men who are not from his or her town. In both movies, greed lies behind the plots. Both movies feature as a central character a cold-blooded killer who does not seem quite human and whom the police officer seeks to apprehend.\"<ref name=\"Conard\" />\n\nJoel Coen seems to agree. In an interview with David Gritten of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Gritten states that \"overall [the film] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by ''Fargo'' (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'\"<ref name=\"Gritten-Telegraph\" /> In addition, Ethan Coen states that \"we're not conscious of it, [and] to the extent that we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to ''Fargo'' did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [and] it is by accident.\"<ref name=\"Cinema Blend\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cinemablend.com/new/NYFF-No-Country-For-Old-Men-6574.html|last= Rich| first= Katey| title= Movie News: No Country for Old Men|website= cinemablend.com| date= October 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Corliss]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine adds that \"there's also Tommy Lee Jones playing a cop as righteous as Marge in ''Fargo''\",<ref name=\"Corliss\">{{cite magazine|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2007/11/08/the-10-best-coen-brothers-moments/slide/no-country-for-old-men-2007/|last= Corliss|first= Richard|title= The 10 best Coen brothers Moments|magazine= Time| date=November 8, 2007}}</ref> while Paul Arendt of the [[BBC]] stated that the film transplants the \"despairing nihilism and tar-black humour of ''Fargo'' to the arid plains of ''Blood Simple''.\"<ref name=\"Arendt\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2008/01/14/no_country_for_old_men_2008_review.shtml|last= Arendt|first= Raul|title= No Country for Old Men-Film Review|publisher= BBC| date=January 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome critics have also identified similarities between ''No Country for Old Men'' and the Coens' previous film ''[[Raising Arizona]]'', namely the commonalities shared by Anton Chigurh and the fellow bounty hunter Leonard Smalls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2007/11/the-movie-review-no-country-for-old-men/68386/ |title=The Movie Review: 'No Country for Old Men' |last=Orr |first=Christopher |date=November 9, 2007 |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic |access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Genre ==\n{{Quote box|width=30em|quote=\"Crime western noir horror comedy\"|source=\u2014Critic Rob Mackie of ''[[The Guardian]]'' on the many genres he believes are reflected in the film.<ref name=\"R.

'' can be enjoyed as a straightforward genre thriller\" with \"suspense sequences ... that rival the best of [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]\",<ref name=\"Arendt\" /> in other respects the film can be described as a western, and the question remains unsettled. For Richard Gillmore, it \"is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are what you might call westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel-drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western.\"<ref name=\"Conard\" />\n\nWilliam J. Devlin finesses the point, calling the film a \"[[neo-western]]\", distinguishing it from the classic western by the way it \"demonstrates a decline, or decay, of the traditional western ideal ... The moral framework of the West ... that contained ... innocent and wholesome heroes who fought for what is right, is fading. The villains, or the criminals, act in such a way that the traditional hero cannot make sense of their criminal behavior.\"<ref name=\"McMahon b; Csaki\">McMahon; Csaki (2010), Part 3, Chapter: ''No Country for Old Men: The Decline of Ethics and the West(ern)'', pp. 221\u2013240, by Devlin, William J.</ref>\n\nDeborah Biancott sees a \"western gothic ..., a struggle for and with God, an examination of a humanity haunted by its past and condemned to the horrors of its future. ... [I]t's a tale of unrepentant evil, the frightening but compelling bad guy who lives by a moral code that is unrecognizable and alien. The wanderer, the psychopath, Anton Chigurh, is a man who's supernaturally invincible.\"<ref name=\"Olson-Gothic\">Chapter 43: \"Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men: Western Gothic\", pp. 465\u2013466, by Biancott, Deborah in {{harvnb|Olson|2011}}</ref>\n\nEven the directors have weighed in. Joel Coen found the film \"interesting in a genre way; but it was also interesting to us because it subverts the genre expectations.\"<ref name=\"P. Monaco\">Monaco, Paul (2010), Chapter 16: \"Hollywood Enters The Twenty-First Century\", p. 329.</ref> He did not consider the film a western because \"when we think about westerns we think about horses and six-guns, saloons and hitching posts.\" But co-director Ethan said that the film \"is sort of a western,\" before adding \"and sort of not.\"<ref name=\"NYT-Coens\">{{cite magazine|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/magazine/11portfolio-t.html|last= Hirschberg|first= Lynn|title= Coen Brothers Country |magazine= The New York Times Magazine| date= November 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nGillmore, though, thinks that it is \"a mixing of the two great American movie genres, the western and film noir,\" which \"reflect the two sides of the American psyche. On the one hand, there is a western in which the westerner is faced with overwhelming odds, but between his perseverance and his skill, he overcomes the odds and triumphs. ... In film noir, on the other hand, the hero is smart (more or less) and wily and there are many obstacles to overcome, the odds are against him, and, in fact, he fails to overcome them. ... This genre reflects the pessimism and fatalism of the American psyche. With ''No Country for Old Men'', the Coens combine these two genres into one movie. It is a western with a tragic, existential, film noir ending.\"<ref name=\"Conard\" />\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\nOne of the themes in the story involves the tension between destiny and self-determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability, \"that the world goes on its way and that it does not have much to do with human desires and concerns\", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions.<ref name=\"Conard\">Conard, Mark T. (2009), The Philosophy of the Coen Brothers, Part 1, Chapter: \"No Country for Old Men: The Coens' Tragic Western\", by Gillmore, Richard.</ref> Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh ([[Javier Bardem]]) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands \"responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices.\"<ref name=\"McCaffrey\">Boule'; McCaffrey.

One of the themes developed in the story is the shifting identity of hunter and hunted. Scott Foundas stresses that everyone in the film plays both roles,<ref name=\"Foundas-LAW\">{{cite news | url=http://www.laweekly.com/content/printVersion/117631/ | last=Foundas | first=Scott | title=Badlands: Coen brothers transcend themselves with No Country for Old Men | newspaper=LA Weekly | date=November 8, 2007}}</ref> while Judie Newman focuses on the moments of transition, when hunter Llewelyn Moss and investigator Wells become themselves targets.<ref name=\"J.
