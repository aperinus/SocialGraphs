It is Levinson's screen-directing debut, and the first of his \"Baltimore Films\" [[tetralogy]], set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; the other three films are ''[[Tin Men]]'' (1987), ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (1990), and ''[[Liberty Heights]]'' (1999).<ref name=NYT2>{{cite web |date=November 14, 1999 |title=Barry Levinson: Baltimore, My Baltimore |last=Levinson |first=Barry |author-link=Barry Levinson |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/111499levinson-film.html }}</ref> It stars [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Paul Reiser]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Timothy Daly]] and [[Ellen Barkin]] and was released on March 5, 1982. The film follows a close-knit circle of friends who reunite at a Baltimore diner when one of them prepares to get married.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959 [[Baltimore]], friends Modell, Eddie, Shrevie, Boogie, and Fenwick attend a Christmas dance before driving to their usual late-night haunt, [[Fell's Point, Baltimore|Fell\u2019s Point]] Diner. On the way, Fenwick stages a fake car accident, to his friends' annoyance. Boogie, a hairdresser and law student, has laid a $2,000 bet on a basketball game, and declines his family friend Bagel\u2019s offer to call off the bet. Modell accepts a ride home from Eddie while the others pick up another friend, Billy, in town to serve as Eddie\u2019s best man for his New Year\u2019s Eve wedding.\n\nThe next morning, Billy reunites with Eddie at his mother\u2019s house, and they visit their old [[pool hall]]. Shrevie, married to Beth and working as an appliance store salesman, learns from Fenwick that Boogie is taking a date to the movies. At a screening of ''[[A Summer Place (film)|A Summer Place]]'', with his friends watching, Boogie tricks his date, Carol, into groping him through the popcorn box on his lap. She runs from the theater, but the smooth-talking Boogie convinces her it was an accident and their date continues; afterward, Billy punches an old high school enemy.\n\nBilly visits Barbara, a friend working at the local TV station. At the diner, Shrevie discusses married life with Eddie, who is preparing a test of football knowledge for his fianc\u00e9e Elyse, to determine if they will marry. Having lost his basketball bet, Boogie wagers with his friends that he can have sex with Carol. The group parts ways in the morning, and Boogie and Fenwick encounter an [[equestrianism|equestrienne]] named Jane. Meeting Barbara at church, Billy learns she is pregnant, the result of an unexpected night they spent together; she tries to dissuade him from feeling obligated to marry her.\n\nWatching ''[[College Bowl]]'', Fenwick is surprisingly knowledgeable and offers to help pay Boogie\u2019s debt. Shrevie loses his temper at Beth for disturbing his record collection, and storms out. Boogie consoles her, and Fenwick goes to ask his brother for money, but he refuses. Shrevie pulls Eddie and Billy from a screening of ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' to corral Fenwick, who has drunkenly occupied the church\u2019s [[Nativity scene]] in his underwear, leading to their arrest.\n\nIn the holding cells, Eddie reveals that Elyse is taking his test the following night, and Billy faces down a belligerent drunk. Eddie, Shrevie, and Billy are bailed out by their fathers, but Fenwick\u2019s leaves him overnight. They meet Boogie at the diner, and he deduces Eddie is still a virgin, while Billy and Barbara discuss their predicament at the TV station. A lonely Beth visits Boogie at the hair salon, and he is threatened by his [[bookmaker|bookie]], Tank. Learning Carol has the flu, which jeopardizes his bet, Boogie reminisces with Beth about their own past relationship, and they make plans for a tryst while everyone is busy with Elyse\u2019s test.\n\nShrevie, Fenwick, Billy, and Modell, along with Eddie\u2019s and Elyse\u2019s parents, await the results of the football test: Elyse fails by two points, and Eddie calls off the wedding. Boogie brings Beth a wig, secretly planning to disguise her as Carol to win the bet, and drives her to Fenwick\u2019s apartment. There, Fenwick and Shrevie hide in the closet to verify the encounter, but Boogie tells Beth the truth, urging her to work things out with Shrevie. Eddie and Billy visit a strip club, and Boogie arrives at the diner, where Shrevie and Fenwick warn him Tank is waiting. Boogie is ready to accept the consequences, but Tank reveals that Bagel has paid off the debt.\n\nBilly commandeers a piano to lead the entire strip club in a rousing number, to Eddie\u2019s delight. There, Eddie decides to marry Elyse after all, and Billy assures Barbara he genuinely loves her. The wedding proceeds, themed around Eddie\u2019s beloved [[Baltimore Colts]]: Shrevie and Beth reconcile; Boogie, Billy, and Fenwick bring Jane, Barbara, and Diane; and Modell delivers a heartfelt speech. The movie ends as Elyse\u2014whose face is never seen throughout the movie\u2014tosses the bouquet, which lands on the friends' table.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order and most roles per tombstone closing credits, remaining roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Edward \"Eddie\" Simmons\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Laurence \"Shrevie\" Schreiber\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Robert \"Boogie\" Sheftell\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Timothy Fenwick, Jr.\n* [[Tim Daly]] as William \"Billy\" Howard\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Beth\n* [[Paul Reiser]] as Modell\n* Kathryn Dowling as Barbara\n* [[Michael Tucker (actor)|Michael Tucker]] as Bagel\n* Colette Blonigan as Carol Heathrow\n* Jessica James as Mrs. Simmons\n* Clement Fowler as Eddie's father\n* Kelle Kipp as Diane\n}}\nThis was the first credited feature film role for Tim Daly, Ellen Barkin and Paul Reiser.\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2020}}\n<ref>{{cite web |date=1 April 2012 |author=Evan Serpick |title=Diner: An Oral History |url=https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/section/artsentertainment/diner-an-oral-history/ |website=Baltimore Magazine }}</ref>\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film explores the changing relationships among these friends as they become adults through what is mostly a series of vignettes rather than a traditional narrative. Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture realistic camaraderie.\n\nDuring postproduction, an executive, David Chasman, wanted to cut the scene about an unfinished roast-beef sandwich because it didn\u2019t advance the story, but Levinson explained the roast beef was the story, telling audiences all they need to know about their friendship, their competitiveness and their fears.<ref name=\"vf2012\" />\n\nReaction to test screenings of the film was poor and MGM were not sure whether to release the film. Executive producer Mark Johnson's mother knew [[Pauline Kael]] and Johnson obtained a print without MGM\u2019s knowledge and screened it privately for Kael and fellow critic [[James Wolcott]]. Kael called MGM executives and made it clear she was going to write a rave review even if MGM did not release the film, and that other critics planned to do the same.<ref name=\"vf2012\" /><ref>{{cite web |date=11 April 1993 |last=Benenson |first=Laurie Halpern |title=FILM; Time Drags and Rumors Fly When Movies Sit on the Shelf (Published 1993) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/11/archives/film-time-drags-and-rumors-fly-when-movies-sit-on-the-shelf.html |website=The New York Times |quote=M-G-M almost shelved Barry Levinson\u2019s 1982 film ''Diner'' after it tested poorly.
