It stars [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Emma Stone]] as a struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress, respectively, who meet and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. [[John Legend]], [[Rosemarie DeWitt]], [[Finn Wittrock]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nHaving been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongside [[Justin Hurwitz]] while attending [[Harvard University]] together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle penned the script but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. After the success of his film ''[[Whiplash (2014 film)|Whiplash]]'' (2014), the project was picked up by [[Summit Entertainment]]. [[Miles Teller]] and [[Emma Watson]] were originally slated to star, but after both dropped out Gosling and Stone were cast. Filming took place in Los Angeles between August and September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by [[Mandy Moore (choreographer)|Mandy Moore]].\n\n''La La Land'' premiered at the [[73rd Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 9, 2016. The film was a commercial success, grossing $448&nbsp;million worldwide on a production budget of $30&nbsp;million, and received widespread critical acclaim with particular praise given to Chazelle's screenplay and direction, the performances of Gosling and Stone, score, musical numbers, cinematography, and production design. It went on to receive [[List of accolades received by La La Land|numerous accolades]]. It won a record-breaking seven awards from its seven nominations at the [[74th Golden Globe Awards|74th Golden Globes]] and received eleven nominations at the [[70th British Academy Film Awards]], winning five, including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. The film also received a record-tying fourteen nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]], winning in six categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Stone and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Chazelle. In the latter category, Chazelle became the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest winners|youngest winner]] at age 32.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nWhile stuck in Los Angeles traffic, aspiring actress Amelia \"Mia\" Dolan has a moment of [[road rage]] directed at Sebastian \"Seb\" Wilder, a  [[jazz]] pianist. After a hard day at work, Mia's subsequent audition goes awry when the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.\n\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation, despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia overhears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. After the gig, they walk to their cars and 'lament wasting a lovely night together' despite their clear chemistry.\n\nSeb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. backlot]], where she works as a [[barista]], while explaining her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend Greg. Bored with the latter date, she goes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted because the film print begins to burn due to a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the [[Griffith Observatory]] and a lovely dance.\n\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. He begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and they move in together. Seb's former bandmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows this is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.\n\nDuring the band's first tour, Seb and Mia have an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play due to a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play does not go as well as planned; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing the play and for their prior argument, Mia breaks up with Seb and moves back to her hometown of [[Boulder City, Nevada]].\n\nSeb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play and invites her to audition for an upcoming film. He drives to Boulder City and persuades her to attend. During the audition, Mia is asked simply to tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a former stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Seb, confident the audition was a success, encourages her to devote herself to acting.\n\nFive years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to another man, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. When he notices Mia in the crowd, Seb begins to play their love theme on the piano. A dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers. Seb and Mia acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles before she leaves.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Sebastian \"Seb\" Wilder\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Amelia \"Mia\" Dolan\n* [[John Legend]] as Keith\n* [[J.

Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day.
