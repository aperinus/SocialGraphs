It is the seventh installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]]. Set years after the events of ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'', the plot follows a [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] teenage girl (Lincoln) who unwittingly releases Jason from his tomb at the bottom of Crystal Lake, allowing him to go on another killing spree in the area.\n\n''The New Blood'' was intended to have a higher standard of quality than that of the previous installments, with high-profile directors being considered to helm the project. [[Paramount Pictures]] sought a partnership with [[New Line Cinema]] to create a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film between the ''Friday the 13th'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series which would not come to fruition until New Line bought the rights to the franchise, releasing ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' in 2003. After several failed concepts, screenwriter [[Daryl Haney]] suggested an idea akin to \"Jason vs. [[Carrie White|Carrie]]\", in which Jason would battle a teenage girl with psychokinetic abilities.\n\nThe film was released on May 13, 1988 to mostly negative reviews from critics, and grossed $19.1 million at the U.S. [[box office]] on a budget of $2.8 million. It was followed by ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan]]'' one year later.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter witnessing her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother, a young Tina Shepard attempts to escape the chaos at home and heads out onto Crystal Lake in a boat. When her father follows her in an attempt to stop her, Tina's dormant [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities emerge, and she accidentally destroys the dock her father is standing on, causing him to fall into the lake and drown.\n\nYears later, a teenage Tina is still struggling with remorse surrounding her father's death. Her mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence as part of her treatment from her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. He begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. In reality, he is only trying to exploit her psychic powers. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Her powers unwittingly awaken mass murderer [[Jason Voorhees]], who was [[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives|chained at the bottom of Crystal Lake years ago]], and he emerges from the water to commit another killing spree.\n\nNext door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael. The group includes Michael's cousin Nick, preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science-fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddy, and snobby socialite Melissa. Nick, who has arrived just for the party, becomes attracted to Tina, much to Melissa's chagrin. Melissa attempts to break up Nick and Tina, even going as far as kissing Eddie to make Nick jealous, but her schemes are to no avail{{snd}}other than making Eddie feel spurned thereafter. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of him murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason actually kills Michael and his girlfriend Jane, later murdering another couple camping in the woods as well.\n\nWhen Tina goes off with Nick to find her mother, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens one by one. Russell and Sandra go to the lake for a swim. While Sandra goes skinny-dipping, Russell is killed with an axe to his face. Sandra discovers his body before she is pulled under the water and drowned. Maddy goes looking for David but finds Russell's body. She runs for help, but Jason attacks her in a nearby barn and kills her with a sickle. Jason then kills Ben by crushing his skull and then Kate by driving a party horn into her eye. Inside the house, Jason stabs David and slices Eddie's neck open. Upstairs, Robin finds David's severed head and is thrown out through a window to her death. When Jason attacks Dr. Crews, he saves himself by using Amanda as a [[human shield]], but Jason eventually kills him with a pole chainsaw. Tina finds her mother's body shortly afterwards and uses her powers to electrocute Jason and to crash part of the house down onto him. When Nick and Tina try to tell Melissa what happened, she thinks that they are crazy and tries to leave, but Jason kills her with an axe to the face.\n\nNick tries to fight off Jason, but he is quickly subdued. Tina unleashes her powers, breaking Jason's mask and exposing his disfigured and decomposed face. As the battle rages on, the Shepard lakeside cabin is destroyed by an explosive fire and the attack continues on the dock. Although Tina is unable to kill Jason, she unknowingly summons the spirit of her father, who rises from the lake and drags Jason back down with him into the depths of Crystal Lake, chaining the serial killer once more.\n\nThe following morning, Tina and Nick are taken away in an ambulance. Someone finds Jason's broken mask in the wreckage and the screen fades to black as Jason's whispers can be heard in the distance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n* [[Lar Park Lincoln]] as Tina Shephard\n* [[Kevin Spirtas|Kevin Blair]] as Nicholas Rogers\n* [[Susan Blu]] as Mrs. Amanda Shepard\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as Dr. Crews\n* Susan Jennifer Sullivan as Melissa Ashley Emerson Paur\n* [[Elizabeth Kaitan]] as Robin Peterson\n* Jon Renfield as David Peabody\n* Jeff Bennett as Edward Kelso\n* [[Heidi Kozak]] as Sandra Casey\n* [[Diana Barrows]] as Madison Paulson\n* Larry Cox as Russell Bowen\n* Craig Thomas as Benjamin MacNeal\n* Diane Almeida as Katherine Pataki\n* [[William Butler (actor)|William Butler]] as Michael\n* Staci Greason as Jane McDowell\n* Debora Kessler as Judith Williams\n* Michael Schroeder as Dan Carter\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nAfter the previous installment, ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]'', which reintroduced the Jason Voorhees character, ''Part VII'' was originally intended to be a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover film]] between Jason Voorhees and [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref name=clm>{{cite AV media|type=Documentary|title=Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher=Image Entertainment|year=2013|author=Farrands, Daniel}}</ref> With each ''Friday the 13th'' sequel, the box office profits were diminishing, with the films in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series grossing nearly twice the amount of the ''Friday'' films.<ref name=gq>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/friday-the-13th-vii|title=The Friday the 13th Movie That Was Supposed to Win an Academy Award|author=Scott Meslow|date=October 13, 2017|website=[[GQ]]|access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name=weminoredinfilm>{{cite web|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/03/14/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood/|title=13 Things You May Not Know About Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood|author=Kelly Konda|date=March 14, 2014|website=We Minored in Film|access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]] proposed the crossover idea to [[New Line Cinema]], the rival company who held the rights to the ''Elm Street'' films, with Paramount controlling domestic distribution and New Line controlling international distribution.<ref name=weminoredinfilm /> The idea was abandoned after the two companies failed to come to an agreement, with the concept only coming to fruition after New Line purchased the rights to the ''Friday the 13th'' franchise, releasing ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' in 2003.<ref name=gq />\n\nOne of the concepts for ''Part VII'' was conceived by associate producer Barbara Sachs, and was noted as being similar to the plot of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', wherein a corporate land developer covers up the previous Jason Voorhees massacres in order to profitably build condos on Crystal Lake.<ref name=gq /> Executive producer [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]] resisted the idea, and screenwriter [[Daryl Haney]] stated \"There\u2019s always a teenage girl who\u2019s left to battle Jason by herself.

Although [[C. J. Graham]], who had portrayed Jason in ''Part VI'', was initially considered, Hodder was ultimately chosen based on his work in the film ''[[Prison (1987 film)|Prison]]'', for which ''The New Blood''{{'s}} director, Carl Buechler, had worked on as the [[Prosthetic makeup|special effects make-up]] artist.<ref name=clm/> In that movie, Hodder filmed a scene in which his character, a prisoner executed in the electric chair, rises from the grave; Hodder himself had suggested to Buechler that he have maggots coming out of his mouth during the scene to heighten the effect of decomposition, and went on to film the sequence with live maggots spilling out of his mouth. Buechler remembered Hodder's commitment to the part when casting ''The New Blood'', and chose Hodder over Graham. Graham expressed disappointment, as he had hoped to reprise the role of Jason and make himself synonymous with the character, as [[Boris Karloff]] had with [[Frankenstein's monster]], but ultimately expressed satisfaction with Hodder's portrayal and said that he bore no ill will about not being asked to return. Hodder would go on to make cinematic history for the longest uninterrupted onscreen [[controlled burn]] in Hollywood history. For the scene in which Tina causes the furnace to shoot flames at Jason, Hodder was actually set on fire by an apparatus rigged so that the ignition could be captured on film (as opposed to being edited in later with trick photography). Hodder was on fire for a full forty seconds, a record at the time.\n\n===Post-production===\nThough one contemporary critic noted that the film is \"nearly devoid of blood and gore by '80s slasher standards,\" several explicit scenes of gore were cut in order to avoid an X rating.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 17, 2015|author=Bowman, Parker|pages=5\u2013B, 8\u2013B|title=Horror Club serves up pizza, mayhem|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22909870/visalia_timesdelta/|via=Newspapers.com|work=Visalia Times-Delta|location=Visalia, California}}</ref> Among these were the murder sequences of Judy, who was originally bashed a against a tree in her sleeping bag six times instead of one; Maddy, who originally had a [[sickle]] jammed through her neck; Ben's death, which showed Jason crushing his head into a bloody pulp; Kate's death revealed the gory aftermath of a party horn to her eyeball; Eddie's head hit the floor; a shot of Russell's face splitting open with a large [[Blood squirt|blood spurt]]; Dan's original death had Jason ripping out his guts; Amanda Shepard's death originally showed Jason stabbing her from behind, with the resulting blade going through her chest and subsequent blood hitting Dr. Crews; Dr. Crews's death showed Jason's tree-trimming saw violently cutting into his stomach, sending a fountain of blood and guts in the air; Melissa's original death had Jason cleaving her head in half with an axe with a close-up of her eyes still wriggling in their sockets. The boxed set DVD release of all of the films and the single deluxe edition have all these scenes available as deleted scenes in rough workprint footage; however, the deluxe edition features more additional footage than the boxed set.\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Harry Manfredini]] and [[Fred Mollin]]\n| cover      = File:The album cover of Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood Soundtrack.png\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 30, 2020 (La-La Land)\n| recorded   = 1988\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = {{duration|h=1|m=18|s=22}}\n| label      = La-La Land\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nOn {{Start date|2005|9|27}}, BSX records released a limited edition CD of Fred Mollin's ''Friday the 13th Part VII'' and ''VIII'' scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buysoundtrax.stores.yahoo.net/frid13par7an.html|title=Friday the 13th Part 7 and 8 - Original Score By Fred Mollin|publisher=BuySoundtrax.com|access-date=July 10, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017122632/http://buysoundtrax.stores.yahoo.net/frid13par7an.html|archive-date=October 17, 2011}}</ref> A vinyl release of the soundtrack including the complete Fred Mollin cues, along with material by Harry Manfredini was released by Waxwork Records in July 2020<ref>{{Cite web|title=Friday The 13th Part VII: The New Blood|url=https://waxworkrecords.com/products/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood|access-date=July 3, 2020|website=Waxwork Records|language=en}}</ref> and on [[Compact disc|CD]] by La-La Land Records in the United States on October 30, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Friday-13th-Part-VII-Picture/dp/B08MBH8FWC|title=Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood Music From the Motion Picture|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|access-date=November 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe Deluxe DVD Edition was released September 15, 2009.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood'' opened on Friday, May 13, 1988 in 1,796 theaters, debuting at number 1 and earning $8.2 million in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Indianapolis News|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|title='Friday the 13th' creeps into first|publisher=Associated Press|date=May 18, 1988|page=B-12|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22909698/the_indianapolis_news/|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Ultimately, the film would go on to gross a total of $19.1 million at the U.S. box office, placing it at number 53 on the list of the year's top earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=friday13th7.htm|title=Friday the 13th Part VII|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood'' was not screened in advance for critics.
