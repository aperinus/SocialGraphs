The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn the Jungle of Nool, [[Horton the Elephant]], the jungle\u2019s eccentric teacher, hears a tiny yelp coming from a floating dust speck and gives chase to it before placing it on top of a pink flower. Horton finds out the speck harbors the city of [[Whoville]] and its inhabitants, the Whos, led by Mayor Ned McDodd, whose family includes his wife Sally, 96 daughters whose names all begin with the letter H, and one young son named JoJo. Despite being the oldest child and next in line for the mayoral position, JoJo does not want to be the next mayor, and he does not talk because he is so scared of disappointing his father. Once Horton begins carrying the speck with him, the city starts experiencing strange [[phenomena]] ([[earthquake]]s and changes in the [[weather]]), and the Mayor finds his attempts to caution Whoville challenged by the Town Council, led by the opportunistic yet condescending Chairman.\n\nAfter he makes contact with Horton, the Mayor finds out from local scientist Dr. Mary Lou LaRue that Whoville will be destroyed if Horton does not find a \"safer, more stable home\". With the help of his best friend Morton the mouse, Horton decides to place the speck atop Mt. Nool, the safest place in the jungle. The head of the jungle, the Sour Kangaroo, who refuses to believe that the Whos exist, demands numerous times that Horton give up the speck for overshadowing her authority, but Horton refuses. Also taking force toward Horton are the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys who like to cause havoc around the jungle. Eventually, the Kangaroo enlists a sinister but idiotic [[vulture]] named Vlad Vladikoff to get rid of the speck by force. He initially only agrees to do it in exchange for the Kangaroo's son Rudy, but when she threatens to hire the Wickersham Brothers to do it as she will probably change her mind, he eventually decides to do it for free.\n\nVlad does many attempts to steal the flower, but Horton outruns him. In a last attempt to steal it, Vlad manages to steal the flower away from Horton and drops it into a massive field of identical pink flowers causing an large tremor in Whoville. After unsuccessfully picking 2,999,999 flowers, Horton eventually recovers the flower (exactly the 3,000,000th flower), also revealing himself to the rest of Whoville. The Kangaroo eventually finds out that Horton still has the speck, fires Vlad, and rallies the jungle community into arresting Horton, preying on their fears that their own children will become chaotic delinquents under his influence.\n\nUpon cornering him, the Kangaroo offers Horton a final chance to renounce Whoville's existence. Horton refuses, and despite the heartfelt speech that he gives, the Kangaroo orders the animals to rope and cage him, and to have the speck and Whoville destroyed by dropping it in a pot of beezlenut oil. The Mayor enlists all of his people to make noise, so that all the animals will find out they're really there, assisted by JoJo's \"Symphonophone\", an invention which creates a huge musical contribution and reveals that JoJo's \"true\" passion is music, but still fails to penetrate the surface of the speck.\n\nThe Kangaroo snatches the flower from the captured Horton and prepares to drop it into the pot. Meanwhile, JoJo grabs the horn that was used to project Horton's voice, runs up the highest tower, and screams his first word, breaking through the sound barrier just seconds before the speck hits the oil. Rudy grabs the flower and proclaims he hears it, and the other animals of Nool notice that they hear it too. Despite his mother's objections, Rudy returns the flower to the released Horton, while the animals, realizing the truth about the Whos' existence, turn on the Kangaroo for deceiving them. While being praised for his integrity by his neighbors, Horton forgives the devastated and regretful Kangaroo, who befriends him with a makeshift umbrella for Whoville. The film ends with the Whos and the animals of Nool gathering to recite the chorus from \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\" by [[REO Speedwagon]], and it is revealed that the Jungle of Nool (and [[Earth]] as a whole) is just one speck, like Whoville, among numerous others, floating in space.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Jim Carrey horton hears a who 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Carrey]] and his family at the world premiere of the film in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]]]]\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Horton the Elephant]], a big-hearted, eccentric, goofy, naive, and outgoing elephant and teacher in the Jungle of Nool who possesses acute hearing abilities.\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Mayor Ned McDodd, the eccentric and fun-loving mayor of Whoville who has 96 daughters, 1 son named JoJo and a wife named Sally.\n* [[Carol Burnett]] as the Sour Kangaroo, an egomaniacal kangaroo who mistrusts Horton's inquisitive nature as a threat to her legal authority over Nool.\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Vlad Vladikoff, a scary, savage and murderous yet goofy, eccentric and idiotic vulture with a [[Russian accent]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chocano|first1=Carina|title='Horton' Here Isn't a Hoot|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/14/entertainment/et-who14|access-date=March 28, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 14, 2008|archive-date=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329140545/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/mar/14/entertainment/et-who14|url-status=live}}</ref> hired by the Sour Kangaroo to steal Horton's flower.\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Morton, a mouse and Horton's best friend in the Jungle of Nool who does not believe his story, but still helps him. \n* [[Dan Fogler]] as The Chairman, the lead Whoville councilman who is dedicated to traditions and mistrustful of Mayor McDodd. \n** Fogler also voices Yummo Wickersham, the largest and oldest of the Wickersham apes and the leader and older brother of the Wickershams.\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Dr. Mary Lou LaRue, a professor, scientist and inventor at Who U.\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Tommy, a fat orange bear cub and one of Horton's students.\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Sally O'Malley-McDodd, Mayor McDodd's wife and mother to Jojo and her 96 daughters.\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Mrs. Quilligan, a [[If I Ran the Zoo|Russian Palooski]] and Jessica's mother.\n* [[Jesse McCartney]] as JoJo McDodd, Mayor McDodd's quiet eldest son who does not want to be the next mayor.\n** Fletcher Sheridan provides JoJo's singing voice in the film's final song.\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as Helga McDodd, one of the mayor's daughters.\n* [[Josh Flitter]] as Rudy Kangaroo, Sour Kangaroo's doubtful son who is much kinder than his mother.\n* [[Niecy Nash]] as Miss Yelp, Mayor McDodd's secretary.\n* Laura Ortiz as Jessica Quilligan, a [[If I Ran the Zoo|Russian Palooski]], Mrs. Quilligan's daughter and one of Horton's students.\n* [[Colleen O'Shaughnessey]] as Angela, a female glummox and one of Horton's students.\n* [[Joey King]] as Katie, a cute and eccentric yet odd baby yak.\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as Willie, an orange bear and Tommy's dad.\n* [[Marshall Efron]] and Tim Nordquist as the Wickersham Guards and brothers, Yummo's younger brothers and Henchmen.\n* [[Heather Goldenhersh]] as Who Girl\n* [[Charles Osgood]] as the Narrator\n\n==Production==\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of the ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' 2003 film, [[Dr. Seuss]]' widow, Audrey Geisel, was so unhappy with the film, so she then decided not to allow any more live-action feature films based on his work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/seussentenial-100-years-dr-seuss-2D80556399|title=Seussentenial: 100 years of Dr. Seuss|website=TODAY.com|access-date=August 14, 2020|archive-date=August 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815085620/https://www.today.com/popculture/seussentenial-100-years-dr-seuss-2D80556399|url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2005, as [[Blue Sky Studios]] was completing ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'', the studio and [[20th Century Fox Animation]] president [[Chris Meledandri]] asked Geisel about getting the adaptation rights for ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]''.<ref name=indie>{{cite news|last=Carnevale|first=Rob|title=Dr Seuss' Horton Hears A Who -

A major theme regards learning about universal values between vastly different places and people, as shown by the quote \"A person's a person, no matter how small\". This is employed on many levels: primarily with Horton and the Mayor of Whoville making contact and championing each other to the point where everyone around them eventually learns the truth about the speck that Whoville resides on; but also with the Mayor and Sour Kangaroo's relationships with their respective sons, Horton and the Mayor being challenged by Sour Kangaroo and the Chairman, the fickle herd mentality of the jungle community (save Horton's students and Morton) and Horton still forgiving Sour Kangaroo, and the ending shot of all of the worlds being specks in space.<ref>\"A Person is a Person: A Universal Message\", ''Horton Hears a Who!''
