Phibes survived the crash, but was horribly scarred and left unable to speak. He remade his face with [[prosthetics]] and used his knowledge of [[acoustics]] to regain his voice. Resurfacing secretly in [[London]] in 1925, Phibes believes his wife was a victim of her doctors' incompetence, and begins elaborate plans to kill those he believes are guilty for her death.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n\nAided in his quest for vengeance by his beautiful and silent assistant Vulnavia, Phibes uses the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues of Egypt]] as his inspiration, wearing an [[amulet]] with [[Hebrew letters]] corresponding with each plague as he conducts the murders. After three doctors have been killed, Inspector Trout, a detective from [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]], learns that they all had worked under the direction of Dr Vesalius, who tells him the deceased had been on his team when treating Victoria, as were four other doctors and one nurse. Trout discovers one of Phibes' amulets (torn off during a struggle) at the murder scene of the fourth doctor, which takes place while he is interviewing Vesalius. He first takes it to the jeweller who made it, then to a [[rabbi]] to learn its meaning. Now believing Phibes may still be alive, Trout and Vesalius go to the Phibes mausoleum at [[Highgate Cemetery]]. Inside they find a box of ashes in Phibes' coffin, but Trout deduces they are probably the remains of Phibes' chauffeur. Victoria's coffin is empty.\n\nThe police are unable to prevent Phibes from killing the remaining members of Vesalius' team, so they focus their efforts entirely on protecting Vesalius himself. Phibes kidnaps Vesalius' son Lem, then calls Vesalius and tells him to come alone to his mansion on Maldene Square if he wants to save his son's life. Trout refuses to let him go so Vesalius knocks the inspector unconscious, then races to Phibes' mansion, where he confronts him. Phibes tells him his son is under [[anaesthesia]] and prepared for surgery. Phibes has implanted a key near the boy's heart that will unlock his restraints. Vesalius has to surgically remove the key within six minutes (the same time Victoria was on the operating table) to release his son before acid from a container above Lem's head is released and kills him. Vesalius succeeds and moves the table out of the way. Vulnavia, who was ordered to destroy Phibes' mechanical creations, is surprised by Trout and his assistant; backing away, she is drenched with the acid and killed.\n\nConvinced that he has accomplished his vendetta, Phibes retreats to the basement to inter himself in a stone [[sarcophagus]] containing the [[Embalming|embalmed]] body of his wife. He proceeds to drain his blood while simultaneously replacing it with embalming fluid and lies down in the sarcophagus next to Victoria. The coffin's inlaid stone lid lowers into place, concealing it. Trout and the police arrive but cannot find Phibes. They recall that the \"final curse\" was darkness just before the basement goes dark.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Dr. Anton Phibes\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Dr. Vesalius\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as Inspector Harry Trout\n* [[Virginia North]] as Vulnavia\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as Rabbi\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Dr. Longstreet\n* [[Derek Godfrey]] as Crow\n* [[Norman Jones (actor)|Norman Jones]] as Sgt.

He also opted to add in some deliberate humor, since critics often razed Price for over-the-top performances, and changed the death of Dr. Kitaj by rats to take place on a plane instead of on a boat. Fuest found the boat death implausible, questioning why Kitaj could not save himself by simply jumping into the water.<ref name=comedy/> [[Peter Cushing]] was originally cast as Dr. Vesalius, but bowed out due to the illness of his wife and was replaced by [[Joseph Cotten]].<ref name=comedy/> The film was shot on the \"20s era\" sets at Elstree Studios in [[Hertfordshire]].

Although the film's plot is set in England in the 1920s, this particular song did not exist until 1943, when [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Johnny Mercer]] wrote it as part of their film score for ''[[The Sky's the Limit (1943 film)|The Sky's the Limit]]''. [[Fred Astaire]] sang the [[jazz standard]] for the first time in that musical comedy. Likewise, the melody of the song \"[[You Stepped Out of a Dream]]\", written by [[Nacio Herb Brown]] (music) and [[Gus Kahn]] (lyrics) and first published in 1940, accompanies a scene depicting Dr. Phibes and Vulnavia dancing together in the ballroom of his mansion. Other musical anachronisms are Vulnavia's playing \"[[Close Your Eyes (Bernice Petkere song)|Close Your Eyes]]\" (1933) on the violin, or her placing in a car a music box that plays \"[[Elmer's Tune]]\" (1941).\n\nA [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] [[LP record|LP]] was released concurrently with the film's appearance, which contained few selections from the score, but rather was composed mostly of character vocalizations by [[Paul Frees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/title/22580/Abominable+Dr.+Phibes,+The|title=Abominable Dr. Phibes, The- Soundtrack details - SoundtrackCollector.com|work=soundtrackcollector.com|access-date=31 May 2013|archive-date=8 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408052546/http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/title/22580/Abominable+Dr.+Phibes,+The|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Lampley, Jonathan.
