One day, he is told that his brother Joe, a fisherman who lives in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts|Manchester-by-the-Sea]], has suffered [[cardiac arrest]]; Joe dies before Lee can get to the hospital.\n\nLee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son Patrick about his father's death. While making funeral arrangements, they are reminded Joe's body cannot be buried until spring as the ground is frozen. Lee makes plans to remain in Manchester, living in Joe's house until the delayed burial.\n\nWhen Lee meets with Joe's attorney he is shocked to discover Joe named him as Patrick's legal guardian. Flashbacks reveal that Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three small children. While intoxicated one night, Lee forgot to put the guard in front of the fireplace, leading to the house fire that killed his children. No criminal charges were filed against him, as the police considered it a tragic accident. However, at the station, a guilt-ridden Lee stole an officer's gun, attempting to shoot himself. He and his wife divorced, and Lee left town. Lee is reluctant to commit to the guardianship, as it would require him to move back to Manchester.\n\nPlans are begun for Patrick to move to Boston with Lee but Patrick has strong ties to the Manchester community and stubbornly objects. Lee commits to staying until the end of the school year. Patrick wants to live with his estranged mother Elise, who still lives in the area. Lee is opposed to this as her history with alcoholism led her to abandon her family, but Patrick decides to reconnect with her over lunch.\n\nElise has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fianc\u00e9 Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds he is unable to connect with her. He is further unsettled when Jeffrey emails him and insists on being an intermediary in any future communication between them. Lee's positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies.\n\nIn response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester and seeks to spend more time with Patrick. Over time, they re-establish their bond, despite conflicts over Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements.\n\nHowever, staying in Manchester is still painful for Lee, as he is surrounded by reminders of his past. One day, Lee runs into his former wife Randi and her newborn child Dylan. A sobbing Randi expresses remorse for her treatment of him during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. Lee deflects her apology, feeling that he does not deserve it. When she insists they reconnect and pleads with him not to \"just die\", Lee is overwhelmed with emotion and has to leave before he breaks down.\n\nDistraught, Lee gets drunk at a bar, picks a fight with strangers, and is knocked out. He awakens in the living room of Joe's friend George and breaks down in tears. At home, Patrick shows his uncle deference after seeing his battered state and pictures of his deceased children. Lee arranges for George and his wife to adopt Patrick so that he can remain in Manchester while Lee takes a job in Boston. When Patrick asks Lee why he cannot remain in Manchester, Lee says that he \"can't beat it.\"\n\nDuring a walk after Joe's [[Funeral#Burial service|burial service]], Lee tells Patrick he is searching for a residence in Boston with an extra room so Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In the final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurbished boat, which Patrick has inherited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Patrick Chandler, Lee's 16-year-old nephew and charge\n** Ivy O'Brien as young Patrick{{refn|group=note|Credited at Ben O'Brien}}\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Randi, Lee's ex-wife\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Chandler, Lee's brother and Patrick's father\n* [[C.

'''52''' (6):48\u201352</ref> Remarking on the way flash-backs appear suddenly during the movie, critic Anthony Lane says that Lonergan \"proceeds on the assumption that things are hard, some irreparably so, and that it's the job of a film not to smooth them over.\"<ref name=demons/> He also noted the tragedy is  juxtaposed with \"the harsh comedy that colors much of the dialogue, and the near-farcical frequency with which things go wrong.\"<ref name=lane/>  Along those same lines, critic Steven Mears called the film \"a study of grief and reticence that finds droll humor in those very sources,\"<ref name=Mears>Mears, Steven (January/February 2017), \"Manchester by the Sea.\" ''Film Comment''.
