Distributed in the USA/Canada by [[20th Century Fox]] and internationally by [[Paramount Pictures]] alongside [[Comedy Central Films]], the film was released on February 23, 2007 to mixed reviews from critics, most of whom said that fans of the show will appreciate it more than those not familiar with the material.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens outside a building where [[Terrorism|terrorists]] are holding hostages and a nuclear bomb. The [[Reno]] Sheriff's Department arrives in a helicopter, called in as experts. As the group prepare to deal with the situation, Deputy Travis Junior wakes up and realizes it was a dream; he was sleeping at the wheel and the vehicle he and Lt. Dangle are in crashes.\n\nThe film continues with introductory clips of the officers, telling how they became interested in law enforcement, \u00e0 la ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]''. After a scene involving a chicken in the road miscoded as an \"armed person on a roof\", Dangle tells everyone that they have been invited to the American Police Convention in [[Miami Beach]]. On arrival, the group finds they're not on the entrant list. Having nowhere to stay, they rent rooms at a motel that seems to be a hub of illegal activities. After partying most of the night, most of the police officers unsuccessfully attempt to seduce one another at the motel, with the males eventually turning to [[Masturbation|pleasuring themselves]] to the shock of the ones outside.\n\nAs everyone recovers from their hangovers, Johnson discovers a tattoo on her breast of a mystery man. The team return to the convention to see if their tickets were found, but discover the building has been the subject of a bio-chemical terrorist attack that has quarantined the police inside. The only city official left outside is assistant deputy mayor Jeff Spoder. The head of National Security asks the Reno Sheriffs Department to provide law enforcement for Miami Beach. A high-ranking [[SWAT]] agent, Rick \"The Condor\" Smith, arrives on the scene to give a pep talk, but soon ends up blowing himself up with a grenade he had unpinned during the talk.\n\nThe team assume the Miami Sheriff's responsibilities, and respond to several emergency calls including an alligator in a swimming pool; street prostitution that leads to ''Reno: 911'' regular Terry who is in town to record an album; and a dead beached whale, which they eventually remove by [[Exploding whale|blowing it up]]. Jones and Garcia are repeatedly kidnapped by Ethan, a drug lord who tries to act like [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''. Spoder fires the team for their incompetence, but as the team brings a cake to apologize to him they discover Spoder in cahoots with Ethan to create a drug empire. Spoder kills Ethan and escapes with the bio-terrorism antidote. The team chase Spoder, who holds them at gunpoint until Jones and Garcia arrive in a Marine helicopter and Spoder surrenders. Lt. Dangle arrests him, but Wiegel, who had been siting in the helicopter, accidentally blows Spoder up.\n\nThe antidote is distributed, and the Reno Sheriff's Department are eventually congratulated by their peers for their actions. Dangle accepts a job at the Sheriff's Department at [[Aspen]], who had repeatedly turned him down previously. The remaining team are offered a flight back to Reno by Terry, revealed to have a rich father, on his private jet. Back in Reno, Garcia briefs the team on their day's work. Dangle enters, interrupting the briefing, and explains that Aspen has a zero-tolerance policy forbidding homosexual sheriffs. Dangle continues the briefing, and reveals the group have been invited to a convention at [[Scotland Yard]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as Deputy James Oswaldo Garcia\n* [[Mary Birdsong]] as Deputy Cherisha Kimball\n* [[Robert Ben Garant]] as Deputy Travis Junior\n* [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]] as Deputy Trudy Wiegel\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Lieutenant Jim Dangle\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Deputy Clementine Johnson\n* [[Niecy Nash]] as Deputy Raineesha Williams\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Deputy S.

This is alluded to by Lennon, Garant, and Kenney-Silver on one of the audio commentaries, who say they are not allowed to discuss who performed the song, but say viewers should \"Google it\" to find the answer.\n\nThe film reprises some jokes from the original series for the benefit of first-time viewers, an example being Dangle's explanation for wearing shorts on the job, which was also featured in the first episode of the series.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place throughout March 2006 in Miami and Southern California.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Reno 911!: Miami'' opened in 2,702 venues and earned $10,273,477 in its debut, ranking fourth in the North American box office and second among the week's new releases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2007&wknd=08&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for February 23-25, 2007 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=February 26, 2007 | access-date=December 11, 2016}}</ref> The film ended its run on May 3, 2007 with $20,342,161 domestically and $1,679,101 overseas for a worldwide total of $22,021,262.
