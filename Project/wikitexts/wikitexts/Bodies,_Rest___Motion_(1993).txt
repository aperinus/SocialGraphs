The film stars [[Phoebe Cates]], [[Bridget Fonda]], [[Tim Roth]], and [[Eric Stoltz]]: they play four friends who are interested in the relationships they have and changing their own lives, but along the way their interests in life and each other start to change. The film also stars Bridget Fonda's real life father, [[Peter Fonda]], as a motorcyclist. ''Bodies, Rest & Motion'' was screened in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2618/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bodies, Rest & Motion |access-date= August 22, 2009| work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Carol\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Beth\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Nick\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Sid\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Elizabeth\n* Sandra Lafferty as Yard Sale Lady\n* Sidney Dawson as TV Customer\n* [[Jon Proudstar]] as Station Attendant\n* [[Scott Johnson (actor)|Scott Johnson]] as Chip\n* [[Kezbah Weidner]] as Dine Woman\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Motorcycle Rider\n* [[Amaryllis Borrego]] as Waitress\n* [[Rich Wheeler]] as Elizabeth's Grandfather\n* [[Scott Frederick]] as TV Store Kid\n* [[Warren Burton]] as Radio Preacher (voice)\n\n==Reception==\n[[Janet Maslin]] called the characters played by the four central actors \"quirky, magnetic\", saying they are set against the backdrop of a \"bland, artificial culture winning its war with nature\"; the film is \"much too studiedly [[hip (slang)|hip]] to indulge in a [[happy ending]], but in its wry, offbeat way it does inch forward.

Without the cheat sheet, you'd more likely say the movie is about a bunch of aimless, boring, hopeless drips, who inspire neither sympathy nor interest.
