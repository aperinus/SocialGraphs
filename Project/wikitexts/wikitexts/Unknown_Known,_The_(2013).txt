The film is a summary of 33 hours of interviews that Morris conducted with Rumsfeld over eleven separate sessions during visits to [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. The film was released on April 4, 2014, by [[The Weinstein Company|Radius-TWC]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Roger Ebert]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe major portion of the film is spent addressing excerpts from the countless memos, nicknamed 'Yellow Perils' by his first [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] staff and 'Snowflakes' by the second, that Rumsfeld wrote during his time as a [[Member of Congress|congressman]] and advisor to four different presidents, twice as [[United States Secretary of Defense]].<ref name=\"TUU\"/><ref name=\"yellow\">{{cite news |last= Higginbotham|first=Adam |date=June 11, 2014 |title=The Unknown Known: Errol Morris on Donald Rumsfeld|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10690207/The-Unknown-Known-Errol-Morris-on-Donald-Rumsfeld.html|newspaper= The Telegraph|access-date= September 3, 2015}}</ref> It also focuses on a response Rumsfeld gave to a question at a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] news briefing on February 12, 2002, about the lack of evidence linking the [[government of Iraq]] with the supply of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to terrorist groups. The content of the memos are varied, covering everything from the aftermath of [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]], to [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib]], to the definition of the word \"[[terrorism]]\". Morris returns to the motif of snowflakes swirling within a [[snow globe|globe]] throughout the documentary as he discusses the memos with Rumsfeld, the contents of which the Defense Secretary allowed him limited access to while preparing the film, and several of which Rumsfeld agrees to read aloud on camera.<ref name=\"yellow\"/><ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite news |last= Baker|first=Jeff |date=April 9, 2014 |title='The Unknown Known' review: Donald Rumsfeld, slippery as a snake and just as deadly|url= http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/04/the_fog_of_war_review_donald_r.html|newspaper= The Oregonion|access-date= September 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the documentary, Rumsfeld argues that a major purpose of the Department of Defense is to evaluate \"unknown knowns,\" or \"the things you think you know, that it turns out you did not,\" to anticipate hostile actions before they take place. Illustrating his point, Rumsfeld suggests that the failure of the United States to anticipate the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was a [[failure of imagination]].<ref name=\"TUU\"/>\n\n[[File:US Navy 031002-F-2828D-227 Secretary of Defense, Donald H.
