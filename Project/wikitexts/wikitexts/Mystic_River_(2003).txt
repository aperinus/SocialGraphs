The screenplay, written by [[Brian Helgeland]], was based on the 2001 [[Mystic River (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Dennis Lehane]]. It is the first film in which Eastwood was credited as composer of the [[Film score|score]].\n\n''Mystic River'' was nominated for six awards at the [[76th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Penn, [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Harden, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Robbins. Penn and Robbins won in their respective categories, making ''Mystic River'' the first film to win both awards since ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' in 1959 and until ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975,<!--Do not change 1975 to 1977, even though the 25 years do not add up to 2002. The film's credits indicate a character as being a '75 Reporter\"--> [[Irish-American]] friends Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are playing hockey in a [[Boston]] street. After deciding to write a mural of their names on a patch of wet concrete, two men, claiming to be police officers, kidnap Dave and [[child sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] him for four days until he escapes. \n\nTwenty-five years later, Jimmy is an ex-convict and neighborhood [[convenience store]] owner; Sean is a detective with the [[Massachusetts State Police]] whose pregnant wife Lauren recently left him, and Dave is a [[blue collar|blue-collar]] worker continually [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|haunted]] by the abduction and rape. Jimmy and Dave are related by marriage, Dave's wife Celeste and Jimmy's second wife Annabeth being cousins. Katie, Jimmy's daughter from his first marriage, makes plans to run away to Las Vegas with Brendan Harris, a boy from a family Jimmy despises whom she has been secretly dating. One night, Katie goes out with her friends, and Dave sees her at a local bar. That night, Katie is murdered, and Dave comes home bloodied and injured. He tells his wife that he fought off a mugger and possibly killed him.\n\nSean and his partner Whitey Powers investigate the murder while Jimmy, distraught at his daughter's death, conducts his own investigation using his neighborhood connections. Sean discovers that Katie recognized her killer and that the gun used to kill her, a [[.38 Special]] [[revolver]], was also used in a [[liquor store]] robbery in 1984 by \"Just Ray\" Harris, the father of Brendan. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan claims he still sends his family $500 every month. Brendan feigns ignorance about Ray's gun. Whitey suspects Dave, who keeps changing the story about his hand being injured. Dave continues to behave erratically, which upsets Celeste to the point that she leaves their home and tells Jimmy she suspects Dave might be involved in the murder.\n\nJimmy and his friends invite Dave to a local bar where they get him drunk, and when he is about to vomit, they confront him. Jimmy admits to Dave that he killed \"Just Ray\" for implicating him in the liquor store robbery, which resulted in his imprisonment. Dave reveals to Jimmy that he did kill someone that night, but it was not Katie; he beat to death a child molester whom he found with a [[child prostitute]]. Jimmy does not believe Dave and pulls out a knife. He promises to let Dave live if he confesses to Katie's murder. However, when Dave admits to killing Katie, Jimmy kills him and disposes of his body in the adjacent [[Mystic River]].\n\nMeanwhile, after finding his father's gun missing, Brendan confronts his mute younger brother \"Silent Ray\" and his friend John O'Shea about Katie's murder. Brendan beats the two boys, trying to get them to admit their guilt, and then John pulls out Ray's gun and is about to shoot Brendan. Sean and Whitey, having connected the two boys to the murder, arrive and disarm and arrest John and Ray.\n\nThe next morning, Sean tells Jimmy that John and \"Silent Ray\" confessed to killing Katie as part of a prank gone wrong. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, who is wanted for questioning in the murder of a known child molester. Jimmy does not answer, instead thanking Sean for finding Katie's killers, but remarks \"if only you'd be a little faster\". Sean then asks Jimmy if he intends to send Celeste a monthly $500.\n\nSean reunites with Lauren after apologizing for pushing her away while Jimmy confesses what he's done to Annabeth, who tells him he is \"a king, and a king knows what to do and does it. Even when it's hard.\" During a local parade, Dave's son Michael waits for his father. Sean sees Jimmy and mimics a gunshot at him with his hand, whereas Jimmy spreads his arms in a \"can't help it\" gesture.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sean Penn]] as James \"Jimmy\" Markum\n** Jason Kelly as young Jimmy Markum\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Dave Boyle\n** Cameron Bowen as young Dave Boyle\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Det.

At its starkest, the film, like the novel by Dennis Lehane on which it is based, is a parable of incurable trauma, in which violence begets more violence and the primal violation of innocence can never be set right.
