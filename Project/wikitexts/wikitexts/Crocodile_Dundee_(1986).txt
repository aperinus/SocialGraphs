It stars [[Paul Hogan]] as the weathered [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee|Mick Dundee]], and American actress [[Linda Kozlowski]] as reporter Sue Charlton.<ref>{{cite news|title= Film: 'Crocodile Dundee'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 September 1986|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/movies/film-crocodile-dundee.html |access-date=10 August 2010 | first=Nina | last=Darnton}}</ref> Inspired by the true-life exploits of [[Rod Ansell]], the film was made on a budget of under $10&nbsp;million as a deliberate attempt to make a commercial Australian film that would appeal to a mainstream American audience, but proved to be a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nReleased on 30 April 1986 in Australia, and on 26 September 1986 in the United States, it was the [[List of highest-grossing films in Australia|highest-grossing film of all-time in Australia]], the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide, the [[1986 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|second-highest-grossing film in the United States in 1986]], the highest-grossing non-US film at the US box office ever and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide for the year. There are two versions of the film: the Australian version, and an international version, which had much of the Australian slang replaced with more commonly understood terms, and was slightly shorter. As the first film in the [[Crocodile Dundee (film series)|''Crocodile Dundee'' film series]], it was followed by two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' (1988) and ''[[Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles]]'' (2001), although both films failed to match the critical success of the predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nSue Charlton is a feature writer for her father's newspaper ''[[Newsday]]'', and is dating the editor Richard Mason. She travels to Walkabout Creek, a small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia, to meet Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee, a [[The bush|bushman]] reported to have lost half a leg to a [[saltwater crocodile]] before crawling hundreds of miles to safety. \nOn arrival in Walkabout Creek, she cannot locate Dundee, but she is entertained at the local pub by Dundee's business partner Walter \"Wally\" Reilly. When Dundee arrives that night, Sue finds his leg is not missing, but he has a large scar which he refers to as a \"love bite\". While Sue dances with Dundee, a group of city [[kangaroo]] shooters make fun of Dundee's status as a crocodile hunter, causing him to knock the leader out with one punch.\n\nAt first, Sue finds Dundee less \"legendary\" than she had been led to believe, unimpressed by his pleasant-mannered but uncouth behaviour and clumsy advances towards her. She is later amazed, when in the [[outback]], she witnesses \"Mick\" (as Dundee is called) subduing a [[water buffalo]], taking part in an [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] ([[Pitjantjatjara]]) tribal dance ceremony, killing a snake with his bare hands, and scaring away the kangaroo shooters from the pub from their cruel sport by tricking them into thinking one of the kangaroos is shooting back.\n\nThe next morning, offended by Mick's assertion that as a \"[[wiktionary:sheila|sheila]]\" she is incapable of surviving the Outback alone, Sue goes out alone to prove him wrong but takes his rifle with her at his request. Mick follows her to make sure she is okay, but when she stops at a [[billabong]] to collect water, she is attacked by a large crocodile and is rescued by Mick. Overcome with gratitude, Sue finds herself becoming attracted to him.\n\nSue invites Mick to return with her to [[New York City]] on the pretext of continuing the feature story. At first Wally scoffs at her suggestion, but he changes his mind when she tells him the newspaper would cover all expenses. Once in New York, Mick is perplexed by local [[Mores|behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|customs]] but overcomes problematic situations including two encounters with a [[pimp]] and two attempted robberies. After this Sue realises her true feelings for him, and they kiss.\n\nAt a society dinner at her father's home in honour of Sue's safe return and of Mick's visit, Richard proposes marriage to Sue, and in a haze of confused emotions, she initially accepts in spite of Richard having recently revealed his self-centered and insensitive \"true colours\" during a period of intoxication.\n\nMick, disheartened at Sue's engagement, decides to go \"[[walkabout]]\" around the [[United States]], but Sue has a change of heart and, deciding not to marry Richard, follows Mick to a subway station. There, she cannot reach him through the crowd on the platform, but has members of the crowd relay her message to him, whereupon he climbs up to the rafters and walks to Sue on the heads and raised hands of the onlookers and kisses her, to the delight of the crowd, where they receive a round of applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Paul Hogan]] as [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee|Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee]]\n* [[Linda Kozlowski]] as Sue Charlton\n* [[John Meillon]] as Walter Reilly\n* [[David Gulpilil]] as Neville \"Nev\" Bell\n* [[Mark Blum]] as Richard Mason\n* [[Michael Lombard]] as Sam Charlton\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Gus\n* [[Terry Gill]] as Duffy\n* [[Steve Rackman]] as Donk\n* [[Gerry Skilton]] as Nugget\n* David Bracks as Burt (roo shooter)\n* Peter Turnbull as Trevor\n* Rik Colitti as Danny\n* Christine Totos as Rosita\n* Graham 'Grace' Walker as Angelo\n* [[Caitlin Clarke]] as Simone\n* Nancy Mette as Karla\n* [[John Snyder (actor)|John Snyder]] as Pimp\n* [[Anne Carlisle]] as Gwendoline\n* [[Anne Francine]] as Fran\n* Paige Matthews as Party Girl\n* [[Paul Greco]] as New Yorker\n* [[Sullivan Walker]] as Tall Man\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea to make the film came to Paul Hogan (the lead actor and one of the story writers) when he was in New York. He wondered what it would be like if a Northern Territory bushman arrived in town. As Paul Hogan said:\n{{Blockquote|There's a lot about Dundee that we all think we're like; but we're not, because we live in [[Sydney]]. He's a mythical outback Australian who does exist in part\u2014the frontiersman who walks through the bush, picking up snakes and throwing them aside, living off the land who can ride horses and chop down trees and has that simple, friendly, laid-back philosophy. It's like the image the Americans have of us, so why not give them one? ... We've always been desperately short of folk heroes in this country. [[Ned Kelly]] is pathetic. So are the [[bushrangers]].<ref name=\"Baxter p28\">Baxter p28</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe film's budget was raised through the [[Film and television financing in Australia#History of Government support|10BA tax concessions]] via Morgan Sharebrokers. Paul Hogan used his regular collaborators from TV, including John Cornell, Peter Faiman and [[Ken Shadie]]. [[Linda Kozlowski]] was imported to play the American reporter; [[Actors Equity of Australia|Actors' Equity Australia]] objected to this but eventually relented.<ref name=\"Baxter p28\"/>\n\nThe first scenes were filmed in the small town of [[McKinlay, Queensland|McKinlay]] in Queensland, where the hotel used has original warped and polished hardwood floors. Filming started at the end of the [[dry season]] in [[Kakadu National Park]], this was also due to the fact crocodiles were less active in the filming locations, with areas such as [[Gunlom Falls]] also known as the UDP Falls back in the 1980\u2019s, featured in the movie. The crocodile attack scene was filmed in [[Girraween Lagoon]], just out of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Six weeks of filming were spent working out of Jaja, an abandoned uranium mining camp in [[Kakadu National Park]] in the Northern Territory with an additional week in [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]].
