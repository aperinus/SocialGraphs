Written by Doremus and [[Ben York Jones]], the film tells the story of Anna ([[Felicity Jones]]), a British [[exchange student]] who falls in love with an American student, Jacob ([[Anton Yelchin]]), only to be separated from him when she is denied re-entry into the United States after staying in the country longer than her [[student visa]] allows.\n\nDoremus based the storyline of the film partly on his own long-distance relationship with a woman living in London while he lived in Los Angeles. Rather than writing a traditional screenplay, he and [[Ben York Jones]] compiled a 50-page outline of the film from which the actors improvised almost all of the dialogue. Filming took place over four weeks in Los Angeles and London with a budget of $250,000.\n\n''Like Crazy'' premiered on January 22, 2011 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the festival's Grand Jury Prize. It was released in theaters on October 28, 2011 and grossed over $3.7 million at the box office. Most reviews of the film were positive, with reviewers giving particular praise to the performances of Yelchin and Jones, although some found the plot implausible and contrived.\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Gardner, a British [[exchange student]] attending [[college]] in [[Los Angeles]], meets and falls in love with Jacob Helm, an American student who returns her affections. After graduation, Anna decides to spend the summer with Jacob rather than return to the United Kingdom, unaware of the consequences of overstaying her [[F visa|student visa]], which expired upon her graduation. After returning to London for a family engagement, Anna flies back to Los Angeles, where she is detained, denied entry, and deported back to the United Kingdom by immigration officials.\n\nDespite her efforts at appealing the immigration decision, Anna is told she is banned from entering the United States. The couple's love for each other grows strained by their separation and long-distance relationship. Jacob then leaves behind his successful design business and visits Anna in London for a few weeks after calling her one night. There, he learns that Anna's parents, Bernard and Jackie, have hired an immigration lawyer to try to get the ban lifted. Bernard suggests that marrying may help their efforts. Jacob is uncomfortable with the suggestion, and the couple struggle with their feelings.\n\nAfter Jacob returns to the United States, he and Anna grow apart, and Jacob starts dating Samantha, a girl who's in love with him. Anna also tries to find a new life for herself, beginning work as a secretary for a magazine, but she is unable to abandon her feelings for Jacob. Later, while Jacob is talking to a customer, he accidentally tells \"Anna\" to get the phone, to which Samantha answers. Anna eventually calls Jacob from London, and both admit that they will never find in others what they found in each other and that they should marry. Jacob then breaks up with Samantha, returns to London, and marries Anna in a small [[registry office]] ceremony with her parents as witnesses \u2014 Jacob and Anna affirming that they will \"never allow anything to destroy the feelings we share for each other\". With a tearful parting, Jacob returns to his business in Los Angeles while the couple waits six months before they appeal the ban on Anna's visa.\n\nSix months later, Jacob flies back to the United Kingdom for the appeal, but it is rejected. With their relationship compromised and no hope of resolving the visa issue, Anna and Jacob begin to fight with each other out of jealousy and frustration. Jacob flies back to the US and rekindles his relationship with Samantha while Anna starts dating Simon. Anna eventually gets promoted at work to the position of editor\u2014something she had been working towards. Her love life, however, is not as positive or fulfilling\u2014she realizes Simon does not evoke the same feelings in her as Jacob, whom she still misses.\n\nSometime later, Anna is finally offered a new visa. Anna invites her parents over for dinner to meet Simon, whom they end up not liking. Afterwards Simon proposes to Anna, to which she declines. She leaves her job, boyfriend, and apartment and flies to Los Angeles to Jacob, who greets her with flowers at the airport where they have an awkward reunion. Jacob brings Anna to his house where he joins her in the shower. As the water falls over them they remember happier memories they had together at the beginning of their relationship, which has now become strained due to their indiscretions during the time spent apart.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Jacob Helm\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as Anna Gardner\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Samantha\n* [[Charlie Bewley]] as Simon\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Liz\n* [[Oliver Muirhead]] as Bernard Gardner\n* [[Alex Kingston]] as Jackie Gardner\n* [[Keeley Hazell]] as Sabrina\n* [[Chris Messina]] as Mike Appletree\n* [[Ben York Jones]] as Ross\n* [[Jamie King (actor)|Jamie Thomas King]] as Elliot\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Anton Yelchin (''left'') was Drake Doremus's first choice for the role of Jacob; Felicity Jones (''right'') was cast as Anna after shooting rough versions of several scenes from the film.\n| align     = right\n\n| image1    = Anton Yelchin 2011.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (250 * 2224 / 3347) round 0}}\n| alt1      = Anton Yelchin\n\n| image2    = FelicityJonesTIFFSept2011.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (250 * 564 / 759) round 0}}\n| alt2      = Felicity Jones\n}}\n\n===Development===\nDrake Doremus was inspired to make ''Like Crazy'' by the end of his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles.
