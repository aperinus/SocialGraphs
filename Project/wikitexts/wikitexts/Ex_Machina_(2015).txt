There are four significant characters, played by [[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Sonoya Mizuno]], and [[Oscar Isaac]]. Gleeson plays a computer programmer employed by a billionaire (Isaac) to assess whether a [[humanoid robot]] (Vikander) is sentient.\n\nMade on a budget of $15 million, ''Ex Machina'' grossed $36 million worldwide. It received acclaim, with praise for its leading performances, the screenplay, the visual effects, and the editing. The film was nominated for two awards at the [[88th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and received [[List of accolades received by Ex Machina (film)|numerous other accolades]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. -->\nCaleb Smith, a programmer at the search engine company Blue Book, wins an office contest for a one-week visit to the luxurious, isolated home of the CEO, Nathan Bateman. Nathan lives there with an unspeaking servant named Kyoko, who, according to Nathan, does not understand English. Nathan reveals that he has built a [[humanoid robot]] named Ava with [[artificial intelligence]]. Ava has already passed a simple [[Turing test]] and Nathan wants Caleb to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and [[consciousness]], and whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial.\n\nAva has a robotic body with the physical form and face of a woman and is confined to her apartment. During their talks, Caleb grows close to her, and she expresses a desire to experience the world outside and a romantic interest in him, which Caleb comes to return. She can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system that Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The outages also trigger the building's security system, locking all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.\n\nCaleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan's narcissism, excessive drinking, and crude behavior towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava after Caleb's test, \"killing\" her current personality in the process. After encouraging Nathan to drink until he passes out, Caleb steals his security card to access his room and computer. He alters some of Nathan's code and discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous [[Android (robot)|android]] models with the appearances of women who were held captive. Kyoko reveals to him that she is also an android by peeling off her skin. Later, Caleb examines himself and cuts open his own arm to determine if he himself is an android.\n\nAt their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do to her, and Ava begs him for help. Caleb informs her of his plan: he will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system to open the doors in a power failure instead of locking them. When Ava cuts the power, she and Caleb will leave together. Ava later encounters Kyoko for the first time when Kyoko enters her room.\n\nNathan reveals to Caleb that he observed Caleb and Ava's secret conversation with a battery-powered security camera. He says Ava has only pretended to have feelings for Caleb, who was deliberately selected for his emotional profile, so he would help her escape.  Nathan says this was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb successfully, Ava has demonstrated true consciousness. When Ava cuts the power, Caleb reveals that he suspected Nathan was watching them, so he modified the security system when Nathan was previously passed out. After seeing Ava leave her confinement and converse with Kyoko, Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop them.\n\nAva attacks Nathan but is overpowered and damaged, before Kyoko and then Ava both stab and kill Nathan. In the process, Nathan disables Kyoko. Ava repairs herself with parts from earlier androids, using their artificial skin to take on the full appearance of a woman. She ignores Caleb, who is permanently trapped inside a room as the security system restarts, and leaves the facility. Ava escapes to the outside world in the helicopter meant to take Caleb home. Arriving in an unidentified city, she blends into a crowd of people.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Caleb Smith, a programmer at Blue Book.\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Nathan Bateman, the CEO of Blue Book.\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Ava, an artificial intelligence and android created by Nathan.\n* [[Sonoya Mizuno]] as Kyoko, the in-house attendant of Nathan.\n* [[Gana Bayarsaikhan]] as Jade,<ref name=\"Netflix\">{{cite web|url= https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80023689 |title= Ex Machina|publisher=netflix.com|year=2015}}</ref> an earlier gynoid prototype.\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Jay, the helicopter pilot.\n* Claire Selby as Lily, an earlier [[gynoid]] prototype.\n* Symara Templeman as Jasmine, an earlier gynoid prototype.\n* [[Tiffany Pisani]] as Katya\n* Lina Alminas as Amber\n\n==Production==\nThe foundation for ''Ex Machina'' was laid when Garland was 11 or 12 years old, after he had done some basic coding and experimentation on a computer his parents had bought him and which he sometimes felt had a mind of its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastfieldnews.com/2015/05/21/ex-machina-director-selling-small-films-takes-work/|title='Ex Machina' director: Selling small films takes work|website=eastfieldnews.com|date=21 May 2015|access-date=22 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528180234/http://eastfieldnews.com/2015/05/21/ex-machina-director-selling-small-films-takes-work/|archive-date=28 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His later ideas came from years of discussions he had been having with a friend with an expertise in [[neuroscience]], who claimed machines could never become sentient.

And if the human can't tell they're interacting with a computer, the test is passed\" {{mdash}} is consistent with the modern popular understanding of how we define true AI, ''Ex Machina'' is depicting a test closer to [[Alan Turing]]'s original proposal, in which the machine passes if it can convince a human it is not just human, but specifically ''female''. Jones says what the film means is that today's digital culture \"equates women with machines\". Nathan tells Caleb that Ava's face is a composite based on Caleb's pornography preferences gathered while routinely spying on him, and the first practical use Nathan makes of his pioneering human-like machines is to exploit them sexually. Jones contrasts ''Ex Machina''{{'}}s pessimistic suggestion that AI and robots lead directly to the objectification and sexualization of female (by design) gendered servants of and for emotionally stunted men with the far healthier and compassionate, but still gendered, relationship depicted in [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'' (2013). Jones says we are shown \"Ava's whispered unheard words to Kyoko before they murder Nathan\" because ''Ex Machina'' \"asks us imagine what our abused, exploited devices might do if they could start talking amongst themselves.\" The audience's sympathy for Caleb has been dwindling, and then he \"gets his comeuppance\", swapping roles with Ava, he now the prisoner and she the free agent offering him no more help than he did Kyoko.<ref>Jones, Nick. \"Ex Machina.\" Science Fiction Film and Television, vol. 9, no. 2, Oct. 2016, pp. 299+.
