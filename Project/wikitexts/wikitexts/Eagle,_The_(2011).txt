Adapted by [[Jeremy Brock]] from [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s historical adventure novel ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' (1954), the film tells the story of a young Roman officer attempting to recover the lost [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle standard]] of his father's legion in Scotland. The story is based on the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Spanish Legion]]'s supposed disappearance in Britain. Historically, the purported disappearance of the Ninth Legion in Northern Britain is [[Legio IX Hispana#Theories about the Ninth's disappearance|a subject of debate]].\n\nThe film was a UK\u2013US co-production. It was released in the United States on 11 February 2011 and in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2011. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $38 million against its $25 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn the year 149 AD, twenty years after the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] disappeared in the north of Britain, Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman [[centurion]], arrives in [[Roman Britain]] to serve at his first post as a garrison commander. Marcus's father, who was the [[Primus Pilus|Senior Centurion]] of the ninth, disappeared with the [[Aquila (Roman)|eagle standard]] of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribesmen in a local insurrection. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury.\n\n[[File:The Silchester Eagle, found in the Basilica of the Roman town of Calleva (Roman Britain), Reading Museum (7923959750).jpg|thumb|The [[Silchester eagle]], found in [[Silchester]], inspired the original ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' novel]]\nLiving at his uncle's estate near [[Calleva Atrebatum|Calleva]] (modern [[Silchester]]) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Marcus decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of [[Hadrian's Wall]], he travels north into the territory of the [[Pict]]s, accompanied only by his slave, Esca. The son of a deceased chieftain of the [[Brigantes]], Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an [[amphitheatre]] show.\n\nAfter several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman-born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the [[Selgovae]] tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes \u2013 including Esca's Brigantes \u2013 and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes. The two travel further north until they are found by the Seal People. Identifying himself as a chieftain's son fleeing Roman rule and claiming Marcus as his slave, Esca is welcomed by the tribe. After allowing the Seal People to mistreat Marcus, Esca eventually reveals that his actions were a ploy and helps his master to find the eagle. As they retrieve it, they are ambushed by several warriors, including the Seal prince's father, the chief of the tribe. Marcus and Esca manage to kill them. Prior to dying, the chief reveals that he killed Marcus's father, who apparently begged for his life. Furthermore, the chief is revealed to be wearing Marcus's father's ring. Marcus does not understand Celtic and asks Esca to translate, but Esca never reveals the fate of Marcus's father. With the aid of the Seal prince's young son, they escape from the village.\n\nThe two flee south in an effort to reach Hadrian's Wall, with the Seal People in pursuit. Marcus, slowed by his old battle wound, orders Esca to take the eagle back to Roman territory and even [[manumission|grants the reluctant slave his freedom]]. Freed, Esca still refuses to abandon his friend and instead heads out to look for help. He returns with the survivors of the Ninth Legion just as the Seal People catch up with them. Guern reveals to Marcus that he saw Marcus's father die. He assures Marcus that his father was not a coward and fought to the end. The legionaries, wishing to redeem themselves, accept Aquila as their commander and prepare to defend the eagle standard. As an example to those who would betray their people, the Seal prince kills his young son in front of Esca, Marcus, and the legionaries. He then orders his warriors to attack. A battle ensues, in which all the Seal warriors are killed, along with most of the Ninth Legion soldiers, including Guern. Marcus kills the Seal prince by drowning him in the river. With the enemy defeated, the bodies of both Britons and Romans are laid out by the victors. As Marcus commends their valor, he lights a funeral pyre for Guern. As Guern is cremated, Marcus, Esca and the few survivors of the Ninth return to Roman territory, where Aquila delivers the eagle to the astonished [[Roman Governor|governor]] in [[Londinium]]. There is some talk of the Ninth Legion being reformed with Marcus as its commander. But when Marcus and Esca wonder what they will do next, Marcus leaves the decision to Esca.\n\n===Alternative ending===\nAn alternative ending is featured in the DVD. Marcus decides to burn the eagle standard on the altar where the final battle occurred, instead of delivering it to the Roman governor. He tells Esca that he does this because the eagle belongs to the men who fought for it. Marcus and Esca are then shown approaching Hadrian's Wall on foot and talking about their plans for the future.\n\n==Main cast==\n*[[Channing Tatum]] as Marcus Flavius Aquila\n*[[Jamie Bell]] as Esca\n*[[Donald Sutherland]] as Marcus's Uncle Aquila\n*[[Mark Strong]] as Guern/Lucius Caius Metellus\n*[[Tahar Rahim]] as Prince of the Seal People\n*[[Denis O'Hare]] as Centurion Lutorius\n*[[Douglas Henshall]] as Cradoc\n*[[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]] as Galba\n*[[Dakin Matthews]] as Legate Claudius\n*[[Pip Carter]] as Tribune Placidus\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Chief of the Seal People\n\n==Production==\n[[File:View of loch lomond.JPG|200px|thumb|alt=|Filming took place at [[Loch Lomond]], among other locations.<ref name=\"pendreigh\"/>]]\n[[Principal photography]] began on 24 August 2009 in Hungary,<ref name=\"coming\">{{cite news | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=58320 | title=The Eagle of the Ninth Starts Principal Photography | author=Staff | work=ComingSoon | publisher=[[CraveOnline]] | date=24 August 2009 | access-date=25 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3ia3f0e0ee831a69361bfbfd37bba925d8 |title='Eagle of the Ninth' adds cast |author=Stuart Kemp |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=25 August 2009 |access-date=26 August 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125114714/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3ia3f0e0ee831a69361bfbfd37bba925d8 |archive-date=25 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which doubles for what was later to become England.

They were probably small and dark, like the [[Inuit|Inouit]] [sic], living off seals and dressed in sealskins. We are going to create a culture about which no one knows much, but which we will make as convincing as possible. We are basing it on clues gained from places like [[Skara Brae]] and the [[Tomb of the Eagles]] in [[Orkney]], so that we will have them worshipping pagan symbols, like the seal and the eagle. The reason they have seized the emblem of the Roman eagle from the legion is because to them it [was] a sacred symbol.<ref name=\"linklater\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Achiltibuie]], a village in northwest Scotland, was used as a filming location for the \"Seal People\". Filming started in Achiltibuie on 7 October 2009 and finished on 15 October 2009. The main location was Fox Point, [[Dornie|Old Dornie]]. The Pictish village which was constructed at Fox Point was used on most days of the filming. Other sites included [[Achnahaird]] beach, where a horse chase was filmed, and Loch Lurgainn. Macdonald intended to use locals as [[extra (actor)|extras]]. This was a success with many locals appearing as extras after going to castings in nearby [[Ullapool]]. Their roles included \"Seal Warriors\", \"Seal Princesses\" and \"Elders\".\n\nIn a reversal of Hollywood films about the [[Roman Empire]], Macdonald said the Romans are played by American actors and Rome's enemies by British actors,<ref>{{cite news|title=Swords, sandals and a change of empires|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/swords-sandals-and-a-change-of-empires-20110719-1hmy8.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 July 2011}}</ref> while the British actors Paul Ritter, Mark Strong and Pip Carter used American accents to play their Roman characters.
