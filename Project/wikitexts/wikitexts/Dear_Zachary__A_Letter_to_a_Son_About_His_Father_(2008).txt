It is about Kuenne's close friend Andrew Bagby, who was murdered after Bagby ended a relationship with a woman named Shirley Jane Turner. Turner was arrested as a suspect, and, shortly thereafter, announced she was pregnant with Bagby's child, a boy she named [[Zachary Turner|Zachary]]. Kuenne interviewed numerous relatives, friends, and associates of Andrew Bagby and incorporated their loving remembrances into a film meant to serve as a cinematic [[Scrapbooking|scrapbook]] for the son who would never know his father. Although ''Dear Zachary'' began as a project that was only intended to be shown to friends and family of Andrew Bagby, owing to the way events unfolded, Kuenne decided to release the film to the general public.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Kuenne, Kurt (Interviewee)|date=September 22, 2010|title=Dear Zachary: A Letter to A Son About His Father - Exclusive: Director Kurt Kuenne Interview Part #1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amdoyPhAWtE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/amdoyPhAWtE |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=May 24, 2017|format=|time=|location=|publisher=[[MovieWeb]] on [[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Slamdance Film Festival]] in 2008 and received a limited theatrical release before being acquired for distribution by [[MSNBC]].

The bill, which helps protect children in relation to bail hearings and custody disputes, was signed into law the following year.\n\n==Synopsis==\nKurt Kuenne and Andrew Bagby grew up as close friends in the suburbs of [[San Jose, California]]. Bagby acted in many of Kuenne's amateur movies and, as these films became more professional in quality, he invested in them with some of the money he was saving up for [[medical school]].\n\nNear the end of his time at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Bagby began a relationship with Shirley Turner, a twice-divorced recent graduate of MUN's medical school who was nearly thirteen years his senior. Bagby's parents, friends, and associates were uneasy about the relationship because of what they saw as Turner's off-putting behavior. After graduating in 2000, Bagby moved to New York to work as a surgical resident, and Turner moved to Iowa, also for work, but they maintained a [[long-distance relationship]]. Not enjoying his surgical residency, in 2001 Bagby switched to a [[Family medicine|family practice]] residency in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], which he felt was a better fit for him.\n\nBagby and Turner's relationship began to crumble, and Turner became increasingly possessive. On November 3, 2001, Bagby broke up with Turner at the end of a visit she made to Pennsylvania. She took her return flight to Iowa, but then, the next day, drove the almost 1,000 miles back to Latrobe, arriving early on the morning of November 5. She arranged to meet Bagby at [[Keystone State Park (Pennsylvania)|Keystone State Park]] that evening, where Bagby was found dead the following morning, having been shot five times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_150829.html|title=Turner, infant son found dead|last=Gazarik|first=Richard|date=August 20, 2003|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407085018/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_150829.html|archive-date=April 7, 2010|access-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> When Turner learned she was a suspect in the murder investigation, she fled home to [[St. John's, Newfoundland]]. Kuenne began collecting footage from his old home movies and interviewed Bagby's parents, David and Kathleen, for a documentary about his friend's life.\n\nIn St. John's, Turner discovered, and later revealed, that she was [[pregnant]] with Bagby's child. She was arrested in December 2001, but released on [[bail]] while her [[extradition]] to the United States worked its way through the Canadian courts. The extradition process was repeatedly prolonged by Turner's lawyers based on legal technicalities, and Turner gave birth to a boy she named [[Zachary Turner|Zachary]] on July 18, 2002. Bagby's parents moved to Canada to attempt to gain custody of their grandson. When, in November 2002, a provincial court ruled that enough evidence pointed to Turner as Bagby's killer, Turner was again arrested, and Bagby's parents were awarded custody of Zachary.\n\nTurner wrote to the judge who locked her up and, contrary to normal legal procedure, received advice on how to appeal her arrest and imprisonment. She was released on bail in January 2003 by Judge Gale Welsh, who felt Turner did not pose a threat to society in general.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banaski |first1=Kelly |editor1-last=Vronsky |editor1-first=Peter |title=Shirley Turner: Doctor, Stalker, Murderer |date=May 30, 2015 |publisher=Rj Parker Publishing |isbn=9781987902068 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igL_CQAAQBAJ&dq=Shirley+Turner+wrote+judge+advice&pg=PA56 |access-date=23 October 2021}}</ref> The Bagbys had to give Zachary back to Turner, but they were able to arrange a visitation schedule. While this fraught situation dragged on, Kuenne traveled to the United Kingdom and across the U.S. to interview Bagby's friends and extended family. He went to Newfoundland and visited Zachary in July 2003.\n\nOn August 18, 2003, Turner jumped into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with thirteen-month-old Zachary strapped to her stomach, drowning them both in a [[murder\u2013suicide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/cassidy/2008/02/27/the-story-of-kate-david-and-andrew-bagby/|title=The Story of Kate, David and Andrew Bagby|last=Cassidy|first=Mike|date=March 18, 2007|work=[[The Mercury News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217024447/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/cassidy/2008/02/27/the-story-of-kate-david-and-andrew-bagby/|archive-date=December 17, 2008|access-date=October 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Distraught over Zachary's death, and outraged at the Canadian legal system's failure to protect the child, David and Kathleen mounted a campaign to reform the country's bail laws, which they believed had helped allow Turner to kill her child and herself.
