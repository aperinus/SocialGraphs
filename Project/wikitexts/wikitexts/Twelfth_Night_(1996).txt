Set in the late 19th century, it was filmed on location in [[Cornwall]], including scenes shot at [[Padstow]] and at [[Lanhydrock House]] near [[Bodmin]], with Orsino and his followers wearing uniforms that evoke the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], Viola ([[Imogen Stubbs]]) and Sebastian ([[Steven Mackintosh]]) are young twins who are performing on a ship and use their likeness to tease their audiences. During their journey, they are caught in a storm, shipwrecked and separated. Viola and other survivors end up on the shore of Illyria. A devastated Viola believes her brother dead. She later takes his appearance to join the court of the local Duke Orsino ([[Toby Stephens]]). The young woman has her long, beautiful hair cut by the sailor, conceals her breasts, and dresses like a boy. After that, Viola becomes a [[Page (occupation)|page]], using the name \"Cesario\".\n\nOrsino is madly infatuated by Countess Olivia ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), who is in mourning due to her brother's recent death. She uses the tragedy as an excuse to avoid seeing the Duke, whom she does not love. He sends \"Cesario\" to do his wooing and Olivia falls in love with the messenger, unaware of \"Cesario\"'s real gender. Realising Olivia's feelings for her [[alter ego]], Viola is caught in even more of a quandary in that she is in love with Orsino.\n\nMeanwhile, elements of Olivia's household plot against her pompous [[Butler|steward]] [[Malvolio]] ([[Nigel Hawthorne]]) by tricking him into believing that Olivia loves him. (Malvolio even wears a [[toup\u00e9e]] to appear younger than he is.) His attempts to woo her, however, are met with bewilderment by Olivia who has him [[Involuntary commitment|committed]], where he is subjected to further humiliations by [[Maria (Twelfth Night)|Maria]] ([[Imelda Staunton]]), [[Feste]] ([[Ben Kingsley]]) and [[Toby Belch|Sir Toby Belch]] ([[Mel Smith]]).\n\nSir Toby, Olivia's uncle and a notorious drunk, is also trying to encourage his friend, the idiotic [[Andrew Aguecheek|Sir Andrew Aguecheek]] ([[Richard E. Grant]]) to court Olivia, but she purposely ignores him. Sir Toby pushes Sir Andrew into challenging \"Cesario\" to a [[duel]], which goes very badly for Aguecheek.\n\nFurthermore, Viola's twin, Sebastian, has in fact survived the wreck and has also arrived in Illyria, accompanied by Antonio ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), who saved him from drowning. Antonio, who has \"many enemies in Orsino's court\", is forced to flee when he is recognised and comes across \"Cesario\", whom he mistakes for Sebastian, and is outraged when \"Cesario\" fails to help him out.\n\nArriving at her estate, Sebastian meets Olivia, who, mistaking him for \"Cesario\", talks him into marrying her. When he learns of this, Orsino is furious and dismisses his page, whom he had made a friend and confidante. However, the matter is soon cleared up when Sebastian and \"Cesario\" come face-to-face and the latter reveals her real nature and identity of Viola. Orsino marries Viola.\n\nThe film ends with both couples holding a party to celebrate their marriages, while the supporting players, including the humiliated Sir Andrew and Malvolio, leave the estate with their heads held high and Feste sings his song, \"The Wind and the Rain\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Imogen Stubbs]] as [[Viola (Twelfth Night character)|Viola]]\n* [[Toby Stephens]] as [[Orsino (Twelfth Night)|Orsino]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Olivia (Twelfth Night Character)|Olivia]]\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as [[Sebastian (Twelfth Night)|Sebastian]]\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[Maria (Twelfth Night)|Maria]]\n* [[Mel Smith]] as [[Toby Belch|Sir Toby Belch]]\n* [[Richard E.

In the original play the Captain claims to have been \"bred and born not three hours' travel from\" where they got washed ashore.\n\nThe conflict is not mentioned again in the film (though it could be connected to Antonio's past as \"Orsino's enemy\"), and the Captain appears openly at the party at the end where he is embraced by Viola.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 76% of 34 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Director Trevor Nunn makes some questionable choices, but his stellar cast -- which includes Helena Bonham-Carter, Ben Kingsley, and Nigel Hawthorne -- more than rises to the material.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/twelfth_night_1998|title=Twelfth Night|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=6 November 2021}}</ref> Online film critic [[James Berardinelli]] writes, \"With ''Twelfth Night'', director Trevor Nunn (''[[Lady Jane (1986 film)|Lady Jane]]'') follows in [[Kenneth Branagh|Branagh]]'s footsteps by adapting one of the comedies for the screen.
