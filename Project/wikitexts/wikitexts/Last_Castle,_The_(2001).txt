The film portrays a struggle between inmates and the warden of a military prison, based on the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]].<ref name=\"castle\">[http://www.fortleavenworthcastle.com/ Saga of Fort Leavenworth Castle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205021453/http://www.fortleavenworthcastle.com/ |date=December 5, 2010 }}</ref> A highly decorated U.S. Army [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]], court martialed and sentenced for insubordination, challenges the prison commandant, a [[colonel]], over his treatment of the prisoners. After mobilizing the inmates, the former general leads an uprising aiming to seize control of the prison.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 19, 2001. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing just $27 million against its $72 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Eugene Irwin is brought to a maximum security [[military prison]] to begin a ten-year sentence for deciding to send U.S. troops on a mission in [[Burundi]], violating a presidential order and resulting in the deaths of eight soldiers.\n\nColonel Winter, the prison's commandant, greatly admires Irwin, until Irwin criticizes his much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have. Offended Winter, who has never seen combat, resents the remark. He then opposes what he perceives as Irwin's attempt to change the attitudes of the prisoners, his admiration for Irwin fading fast.\n\nOn one occasion, Irwin is reprimanded after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, Corporal Ramon Aguilar, who had mistakenly saluted Irwin in the prison yard, violating a tenet of Winter's methods for running the prison, that the prisoners are no longer soldiers and therefore should stop acting as such.\n\nContinuing to observe cruel acts, Irwin attempts to unify the prisoners by building a \"castle wall\" of stone and mortar at the facility, which in many ways resembles a medieval castle. Envying the respect Irwin is clearly receiving, Winter orders his guards to destroy the wall. When Aguilar, an integral leader in the wall's construction, blocks the bulldozer, Winter orders sadistic sharpshooter Cpl. Zamorro via a coded hand gesture to fire a normally non-lethal [[rubber bullet]] directly at Aguilar's head, killing him.\n\nAfter the wall is destroyed, Irwin and the inmates pay final respects to Aguilar in formation. Winter later offers some small concessions to Irwin, who rejects them as flimsy, and calls him a disgrace to the uniform, demanding his resignation.\n\nThe prisoners begin to behave like soldiers around Irwin, using code words and gestures. An infuriated Winter reaches out to Yates, an anti-social prisoner and a former officer and Apache helicopter pilot convicted of running a drug-smuggling ring. Bribed to inform about Irwin's plans for a reduced sentence, Yates informs Winter that Irwin intends to take over the prison, then raise the U.S. flag upside down to signal distress.\n\nIrwin organizes a plot to throw the prison into chaos. His intent is to show a friend, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Wheeler, Winter's superior officer, that Winter is unfit and should be removed from command under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. During a visit, Winter receives a letter demanding that he resign, or the prisoners will kidnap Wheeler.\n\nAfter ordering his men into action, Winter discovers that the scheme was just a bluff. Irwin uses the event to gain intelligence on how the prison guards would react during an actual uprising. Wheeler, who has made it clear that he hates Winter, nevertheless respects Winter's argument that Wheeler has no idea what running a military prison is like; he offers to transfer Irwin to another prison if Winter requests it, but Winter declines.\n\nYates discreetly steals a U.S. flag from the warden's office during one of his visits and reveals he is on Irwin's side; Winter orders all the prisoners to be outside in the yard in an attempt to prevent their plot, but this was part of their plan as well, and the riot commences.\n\nUsing improvised weapons, the prisoners capture an armored vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. The prisoners call Wheeler's headquarters and inform him of the riot. Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so he orders that live ammunition be used against the prisoners.\n\nWinter knows from Yates that Irwin ultimately plans to raise the American flag [[Flag desecration#Flying a U.S. flag upside down|upside down]], signaling distress. Irwin's men create havoc, but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards armed with live ammunition. Winter orders the men to lie down, but they refuse. He orders them again, warning them that the sharpshooters positioned above them will fire if they do not obey. Just before he gives the order, Irwin orders his fellow prisoners to lie down. Winter then tells Irwin to return his flag, but Irwin replies, \"It's not your flag\", before he turns and begins walking toward the flagpole in order to raise it.\n\nAn increasingly unsettled Winter tells Irwin, \"You will not raise that flag upside down,\" but Irwin continues walking, despite Winter's orders to cease and desist. Seeing that Irwin is ignoring him, Winter orders the shooters to fire on Irwin, but they do not. He orders them repeatedly, trying to stop Irwin from raising the flag upside down, but after Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag. As his life ebbs away, Irwin continues to raise the flag.\n\nPeretz places Winter under arrest for shooting Irwin. The prisoners, now standing again, begin to salute the flag. Astonishingly, Winter notices that Irwin has actually raised the flag correctly, meaning that he had shot Irwin fruitlessly. The flag flies above the prison's walls as General Wheeler arrives. Colonel Winter is led away in handcuffs. The inmates build a new wall as a memorial to their fallen comrades. Aguilar and Irwin's names are among those carved onto the castle's wall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Colonel Ed Winter\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Sam Yates\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Brigadier General Jim Wheeler\n* [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] as Captain Peretz\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Sergeant Major Dellwo\n* Samuel Ball as Duffy\n* [[Jeremy Childs]] as Cutbush\n* [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] as Corporal Aguilar\n* [[Brian Goodman]] as Beaupre\n* [[Michael Irby]] as Enriquez\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Rosalie Irwin, the general's daughter (uncredited)\n* David Alford as Corporal Zamorro\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:TSP Main Entrance.jpg|thumb|The castle-like appearance of the former Tennessee State Prison]]\nThe film was shot mainly at the 103-year-old former [[Tennessee State Prison]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], which had previously been used for filming in ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' and ''[[Last Dance (1996 film)|Last Dance]]'', and was chosen because of its [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] and castle-like appearance.

A wall {{convert|61|m}} long and {{convert|6|m|spell=in}} high was built, serving as the prison's entrance. A metal walkway and two towers were also built as vantage points for the guards. The film required an office with a large window through which the warden could watch the inmates; this was constructed by the production crew. Director [[Rod Lurie]] insisted on having the prisoners' cells face each other, but this is not the case at the Tennessee State Prison. To solve the problem, production designer Kirk Petruccelli created cells in a warehouse near the prison.<ref name=\"Castle Walls\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastcastle.com/|title=Castle Walls|work=Behind the Scenes|publisher=DreamWorks|access-date=2009-01-08|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226190640/http://www.thelastcastle.com/|archive-date=2008-02-26}}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\nTo show the balance of power, the film crew used multiple [[cinematography]] techniques involving different displays of color, lighting, camera and costumes. In the warden's office intense color was used to reflect freedom or power, in contrast to the washed-out colors from the less powerful yard. The contrasts shift as the story progresses, showing the increasing power of the prisoners. The American flag in the yard is described by Petruccelli as \"the heart of The Castle\" and is the only exemption to the washed-out color palette.<ref name=\"Castle Walls\"/>\n\nCinematographer [[Shelly Johnson (cinematographer)|Shelly Johnson]], in collaboration with director Lurie and the design team, also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers. For example, the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight, in contrast to Winter's office, which is artificially illuminated by lamps. As the film progresses, the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a broken window. The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques. Hand-held cameras were used when filming in the yard to make the audience feel as if they were \"participants in the action\". However, a very precise, sterile camera composition was used in the warden's office. The prisoners' world gets more precise during the film, while the colonel's world is filmed more loosely.<ref name=\"Castle Walls\"/>\n\nCostume designer Ha Nguyen also demonstrates this contrast in the clothing of the cast. The film starts with the prisoners having their clothing divided by ethnicity, with African Americans wearing different headwear, Latinos wearing vests and various arm accessories, and the White Americans in cut-off T-shirts. After the arrival of General Irwin, the prisoners start wearing more similar clothing in a \"sharp military manner\". The uniforms of the prisoners change from the usual chocolate brown color to light grey, because of its muddled look on film and excessive darkness in some scenes. Ha Nguyen also contrasted the non-battlefield ribbons found on Colonel Winter's uniform with the battlefield medals found on General Irwin's uniform (seen only in the opening scene as Irwin is inducted into the prison).<ref name=\"Castle Walls\"/>\n\nThe wall created by the prisoners in the middle of the yard also represents change and incarnation. What is at first a \"discombobulated mess\" representing the lack of unity among prisoners later becomes a perfect wall, a \"powerful symbol of the results of [Irwin's] leadership\".<ref name=\"Castle Walls\"/>\n\n===Effects===\nSpecial effects supervisor [[Burt Dalton]] and stunt coordinator Mic Rodger created the battle weapons used in the final scenes. The [[trebuchet]], used by prisoners to throw rocks, was capable of throwing a {{convert|68|kg|lb}} rock a distance of {{convert|60|m|ft}} with an accuracy of ten feet around the target. The water cannon had the power to shoot {{convert|76|L|USgal}} of water per second. Some of the cast did their own stunts, including Mark Ruffalo, who performed one scene hanging from a helicopter. Interiors of the helicopter were not created with blue screen effects; instead, a special [[gimbal]] was used to hold a full-sized [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey-A]] type [[military helicopter]]. The gimbal was capable of rotating the helicopter 360&nbsp;degrees and vertically moving it 20&nbsp;feet. The gimbal was controlled by a computer, allowing Dalton to precisely set speed and movement; this ensured precise repeatability for multiple takes.<ref name=\"Castle Breach\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastcastle.com/|title=The Castle Breach|work=Behind the Scenes|publisher=DreamWorks|access-date=2009-01-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226190640/http://www.thelastcastle.com/|archive-date=2008-02-26}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Last castle poster reversed.jpg|thumb|The original poster that was pulled out of circulation]]\nPrior to release, DreamWorks pulled the original  poster from circulation, which depicted an American flag flying upside down (a standard distress call), due to concerns about public sensitivity related to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/26/rec.fall.movies/index.html|title=Fall movies undergo changes|last=Vercammen|first=Paul |date=2001-09-26|work=CNN|access-date=2009-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34295,00.html|title=Hollywood Lights Dim After Attack|date=2001-09-11|publisher=[[Fox News]]|access-date=2009-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released on October 19, 2001, in 2,262 North American theaters, grossing $7,088,213 on its opening weekend with an average of $3,133 per theater.
