It follows four gay friends, Andy, Jarod, Nico and Griff, who vow upon graduating high school that they will all lose their \"[[Anal sex|anal virginity]]\" before their friend's [[Labor Day]] party. The film takes content from the 1999 teen comedy [[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]. A sequel, ''[[Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story centers around four [[gay]] friends who have recently graduated from [[campaign for the neologism \"santorum\"|San Torum]] High School. Andy ([[Michael Carbonaro]]) is an awkward, sex-crazed character who frequently [[Masturbation|masturbates]] with his mother's fruits and vegetables. Jarod ([[Jonathan Chase (actor)|Jonathan Chase]]) is a handsome and fit jock who is quite insecure. Griff ([[Mitch Morris]]) is a nerdy, well-dressed guy who is secretly in love with Jarod. Nico ([[Jonah Blechman]]) is the most [[Flamboyancy|flamboyant]], outgoing, and [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] of the group. The four of them decide to make a pact to [[sexual intercourse|have sex]] by the end of the summer. Each boy proceeds to pursue sex in different ways, with both tragic and comedic results. Nico tries to secure an online date with a man named Ryder (Matthew Rush), but ends up with the grandfather (George Marcy) of their lesbian friend Muffler. Jarod seeks out fellow jocks, including  a baseball pitcher named Beau ([[James Getzlaff]]), while Griff tries to earn the affection of Angel ([[Darryl Stephens]]), a male [[Striptease|stripper]]; Jarod and Griff leave these men to have sex with each other instead, because they are in love. Andy, having failed to seduce his long-time crush, his math teacher, Mr. Puckov ([[Graham Norton]]), has a threesome with the rejected Beau and Angel. Much of the humor comes from how awkward each boy is at [[Romance (love)|romance]] and how naive they are about sex. Each plot backfires horribly, until the boys finally begin to change their attitudes towards sex at the end of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Carbonaro]] as Andy Wilson\n* [[Jonah Blechman]] as Nico Hunter\n* [[Jonathan Chase (actor)|Jonathan Chase]] as Jarod\n* [[Mitch Morris]] as Griff\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Dawn Muffler\n* [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]] as Mr. Wilson\n* [[Graham Norton]] as Mr. Puckov\n* Stephanie McVay as Bonnie Hunter\n* [[John Epperson|Lypsinka]] as Mrs. Wilson\n* [[James Getzlaff]] as Beau\n* [[Darryl Stephens]] as Angel\n* [[Richard Hatch (Survivor contestant)|Richard Hatch]] as Himself\n* George Marcy as Grandpa Muffler\n* Megan Saraceni as Mini-Muff\n* Saudia Mills as Muffler Acquaintance\n* [[Andersen Gabrych]] as Tyler\n* Angela Oh as Tiki\n* Joanna Leeds as Daisy\n* [[Mink Stole]] (''[[deleted scenes]]'') as Sloppi Seconds\n\n== Production ==\nTodd Stephens' previous work revolved around gay teens, like ''[[Edge of Seventeen (film)|Edge of Seventeen]]'' and ''[[Gypsy 83]]''. The film was a result of Stephens difficulty in securing distribution of ''Gypsy 83'' because the film was not \"gay\" enough. Stephens said \"I was really angry when I wrote it. Very frustrated. And ''Another Gay Movie'''s what came out.\"<ref name=int>{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-150864848 | title=Naughty Naughty: The Raunchy, Outrageous Sex Comedy Another Gay Movie Pushes Queer Cinema into Taboo-Busting New Territory | publisher=The Advocate | date=August 15, 2006 | access-date= | author=Ferber, Lawrence|url-access= |via=}}{{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref> Actor [[Jonah Blechman]] initially refused the script, but became intrigued by his own shock to Stephens' script that he decided to join the project as the executive producer.<ref name=int />\n\n==Release and reception==\nOn April 29, 2006, the film had its premier at Lowes Village East in New York.<ref>{{cite news |title=Premiere Of \"Another Gay Movie\" At The 5th Annual TFF |publisher=Getty Images |date=April 29, 2006 |author=Wintrow, Scott}}</ref> The film grossed $745,327 at the box office on a $500,000 budget.<ref name=mojo />\n\nTirdad Derakhshani of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' described the film as \"an unapologetic, un-[[politically correct|P.C.]], in-your-face gay take on [[American Pie (film)|''American Pie'']].\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Another Gay Movie': some raunchy fun, and that's it.
