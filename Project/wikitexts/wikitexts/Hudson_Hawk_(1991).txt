Willis-Aiello duets of [[Bing Crosby]]'s \"[[Swinging on a Star]]\" and [[Paul Anka]]'s \"[[Side by Side (1927 song)|Side by Side]]\" are featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\nThe film was a huge critical failure in the United States, only grossing $17 million and earning three [[Razzies]] (including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]), but it was better received internationally and grossed $80 million for a worldwide total of $97 million.\n\n==Plot==\nEddie Hawkins\u2014\"Hudson Hawk\" (from the bracing winds off the [[Hudson River|Hudson]])\u2014is a master cat burglar and [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]], wanting to celebrate his first day of parole with a cappuccino. Before he gets it, he is [[blackmail]]ed by various entities, including his parole officer, the minor Mario Brothers [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] family, and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], into doing a few art heists with his partner, Tommy \"Five-Tone\" Messina.\n\nThe American corporation, Mayflower Industries, is controlling everything, run by husband and wife Darwin and Minerva Mayflower and their butler, Alfred. Headquartered in the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]], the company seeks to take over the world by reconstructing La Macchina dell'Oro, a machine invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] that [[alchemy|converts lead into gold]]. An assembly of [[crystal]]s needed for the machine to function are hidden in a variety of Leonardo's artworks: the [[maquette]] of the [[Sforza]], the [[Codex Trivulzianus|Da Vinci Codex]], and a scale model of da Vinci's helicopter. Sister Anna Baragli is an operative for a secret [[Holy See|Vatican]] [[counter-espionage]] agency, working with the CIA to assist in Hawk's mission in Rome, though intending to foil the robbery at [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]].\n\nThroughout the adventure, Hudson repeatedly attempts to drink a cappuccino. After blowing up an auctioneer to cover up the theft of the Sforza, the Mario Bros. take Hawk away in an ambulance. He sticks syringes into Antony Mario's face, falls out of the ambulance on a gurney, and they try to run him down with the ambulance as they speed along the highway. The brothers are killed when their ambulance crashes. Immediately afterwards, Hawk meets [[CIA]] head George Kaplan and agents\u2014Snickers, Kit Kat, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger\u2014who take him to the Mayflowers.\n\nHawk successfully steals the Da Vinci Codex from another museum, but later refuses to steal the helicopter design. Tommy Five-Tone fakes his death so they can escape. They are discovered and attacked by the CIA agents; Kaplan reveals that he and his agents stole the piece, and unlike them, had no problem killing the guards. Hawk and Tommy escape when Snickers and Almond Joy are killed, and pursue the remaining agents. Kit Kat and Butterfinger take Anna to the castle where the Macchina dell'Oro is being reconstructed.\n\nThe showdown is in the castle between the remaining CIA agents, the Mayflowers, and the team of Hudson, Five-Tone, and Baragli. Kit Kat and Butterfinger are killed by Minerva, although Kit Kat frees Baragli before dying. Tommy fights Darwin and Alfred inside the speeding limo, and Hudson fights George Kaplan on the roof of the castle. Kaplan topples from the castle, landing on the limo. Alfred plants a bomb in it, escaping with Darwin; Tommy is trapped inside while Kaplan is hanging onto the hood. The bomb detonates as the limo speeds over a cliff.\n\nDarwin and Minerva force Hawk to put together the crystal powering the machine, but he intentionally leaves out one small piece. When the machine is activated, it malfunctions and explodes, killing the Mayflowers. Hawk battles Alfred, using his own blades to decapitate him. Hawk and Baragli escape the castle, using the da Vinci flying machine, discovering Tommy waiting for them at a cafe, having miraculously escaped death through a combination of airbags and a sprinkler system in the limo. With the world saved and da Vinci's secrets protected, Hawk finally gets to enjoy a cappuccino.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Eddie Hawkins / Hudson Hawk\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Tommy \"Five-Tone\" Messina\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Anna Baragli\n* [[Richard E.

[[Sony Imagesoft]] released versions of the game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and [[Game Boy]], while [[Ocean Software]] released it for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Atari ST]]. It is a side-scrolling game where the player, as the Hawk, must steal the [[Sforza]] and the [[Codex]] from the auction house and the Vatican, respectively. Then Castle Da Vinci has to be infiltrated in order to steal the mirrored crystal needed to power the gold machine. On his journey, Hawk must face many oddball adversaries, including dachshunds that try to throw him off the roof of the auction house, janitors, photographers, killer nuns, and a tennis player (presumably Darwin Mayflower).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0102070}}\n* {{Amg title|23773}}\n* {{mojo title|hudsonhawk}}\n\n{{S-start}} {{S-ach|aw}}\n{{Succession box\n| title=[[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Razzie Award for Worst Picture]]\n| years=[[12th Golden Raspberry Awards]]\n| before=''[[Ghosts Can't Do It]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]''\n| after=''[[Shining Through]]''\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Michael Lehmann}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Hudson Hawk''\n|list =\n{{Razzie Award for Worst Picture}}\n{{Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay 1980\u20132000}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hudson Hawk}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Lehmann]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joel Silver]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Silver Pictures films]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Vatican City]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Steven E. de Souza]]\n[[Category:Golden Raspberry Award winning films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Daniel Waters (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
