A serial killer is on the loose in Los Angeles, so when the apartment of classical singer Joan Spruance (Barkin) is ransacked and she starts receiving threatening phone messages, Joan moves into the Hollywood Hills home of her sister, Andy (D'Angelo).\n\nJoan does not feel safe there, either, because she is harassed by Andy's ex-lovers. She hires a guard dog from Harry's company, and Harry is soon providing more than protection for the beautiful singer.\n\nHarry is a natural-born liar who, because of his profession, feels that he lives by a code of honor \u2013 even if he cannot quite explain it \u2013 as one thing after another spins out of his control. Joan is soft and vulnerable as she is badgered by her conductor husband, harassed by unknown callers, menaced by men from her sister's past, and \"helped\" by Harry.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Harry Bliss\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Joan Spruance\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Redmond Layls\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Andy Ellerman\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Eddy Revere\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Laurence Moncreif\n* [[Paul Mazursky]] as Lee MacGreevy\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Adele Bliss\n* [[Viveka Davis]] as June Huff\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Helen Dextra\n* [[David Clennon]] as Lewie Duart\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Detective Melvenos\n* [[Gary Graham]] as Butch Gable\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Man Trouble'' was not well received by the majority of critics. It holds a 7% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 30 reviews. The consensus summarizes: \"''Man Trouble'' has brilliant stars and the germ of an interesting idea in its favor, which makes the scattered, unfunny results even more of a disappointment.\"<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Man Trouble |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_trouble/ }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of \"C\" on scale of A+ to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' review said \"Not much about \"Man Trouble,\" a sad mess of a romantic comedy directed by Bob Rafelson, written by Carole Eastman and starring Jack Nicholson, suggests that these three collaborated on one of the most haunting and representative films of another day.\"<ref name=NYT/>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s review said that \"Jack Nicholson fans should feel cheated by ''Man Trouble'', an insultingly trivial star vehicle.

Nicholson plays a grouchy dog-trainer who slowly loosens up in the presence of romantically challenged opera singer Barkin, who needs to get some canine security after a series of death threats. Obviously intended to be a bright and breezy romantic-comedy thriller, it ends up a mangy old mutt of a movie thanks to a charmless script and disastrous casting decisions.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine: \"The trouble is, the film never seems to know where it's headed. Not quite a romance, a thriller or a comedy, it's a movie with an on-going identity crisis. Barkin, playing against type, produces a shrill caricature of femininity, while Rafelson indulges Nicholson's familiar soft-spoken laxity, another of his personable rogues.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nJack Nicholson earned a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor for his performances in both this film and ''[[Hoffa (film)|Hoffa]]'', but lost the trophy to [[Sylvester Stallone]] for ''[[Stop!
