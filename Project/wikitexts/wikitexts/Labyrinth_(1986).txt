Based on conceptual designs by [[Brian Froud]], the film was written by [[Terry Jones]], and many of its characters are played by puppets produced by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]]. The film stars [[Jennifer Connelly]] as 16-year-old [[Sarah Williams (Labyrinth)|Sarah]] and [[David Bowie]] as [[Jareth|Jareth, The Goblin King]]. In ''Labyrinth'', Sarah embarks on a quest to reach the center of an enormous, otherworldly maze to rescue her infant half-brother Toby, whom she wished away to Jareth.\n\nThe film started as a collaboration between Henson and Froud following their previous collaboration ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' (1982). [[Terry Jones]] of [[Monty Python]] wrote the first draft of the film's script early in 1984, drawing on Froud's sketches for inspiration. Various other scriptwriters rewrote it and added to it, including Laura Phillips, Lucas, [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]], and [[Elaine May]]\u2014although Jones received the film's sole screenwriting credit. It was shot from April to September 1985 on location in [[Upper Nyack, New York|Upper Nyack]], [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and [[Haverstraw, New York]], and at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] and [[West Wycombe Park]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n''The New York Times'' reported that ''Labyrinth'' had a budget of $25 million. The film was a box office disappointment, grossing $12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run and over $34 million worldwide. It was the last feature film that Henson directed, and the poor reception contributed to a difficult period of Henson's career, according to his son [[Brian Henson]]. It was first met with a mixed critical response upon its release, but, over the years, it has been re-evaluated by critics and gained a large [[cult following]]. [[Tokyopop]] published the four-volume comic sequel ''[[Return to Labyrinth]]'' between 2006 and 2010. In January 2016, it was announced that a sequel was in development,<ref name=Reboot /> which screenwriter [[Nicole Perlman]] described as more of a \"spin-off\" in the same fictional universe.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Monica|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/no-one-is-remaking-labyrinth-screenwriter-denies-reports-of-reboot|title='No one is remaking Labyrinth' \u2013 screenwriter denies reports of reboot|work=The Guardian|date=January 25, 2016|access-date=January 25, 2016|archive-date=January 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125084115/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/25/no-one-is-remaking-labyrinth-screenwriter-denies-reports-of-reboot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nSixteen-year-old Sarah Williams recites from a book titled ''The Labyrinth'' in the park with her dog Merlin but is unable to remember the last line; they are watched by a [[barn owl]]. She realizes that she is late to [[Babysitting|babysit]] her infant half-brother Toby. She rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother, who leaves for dinner with Sarah's father. Sarah finds Toby in possession of her treasured teddy bear, Lancelot. Sarah is frustrated by this and Toby's constant crying, so she rashly wishes Toby be taken away by the [[goblin]]s from her book. Toby disappears and the Goblin King Jareth appears. He offers Sarah her dreams in exchange for the baby, but she refuses, having instantly regretted her wish. Jareth reluctantly gives Sarah 13 hours to solve his [[maze|labyrinth]] and find Toby before he is turned into a goblin forever. Sarah meets a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] named Hoggle who aids her to enter the labyrinth. She has trouble finding her way at first and meets a talking worm who inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction.\n\nSarah ends up in an [[oubliette]] where she reunites with Hoggle. The two are confronted by Jareth, escape one of his traps, and encounter a large beast named Ludo. Hoggle flees in a cowardly fashion, while Sarah befriends Ludo after freeing him from a trap but loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who gives him an enchanted peach and instructs him to give it to Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to take her back to the beginning of the labyrinth. Sarah is harassed by a group of creatures called The Fire Gang, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and they fall through a trapdoor that sends them to a [[Flatulence|flatulent]] swamp called the \"Bog of Eternal Stench\", where they reunite with Ludo. The trio meet the guard of the swamp, the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] fox Sir Didymus and his [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] \"steed\" Ambrosius. Ludo summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, and Didymus joins the group. The group gets hungry, so Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and forgets her quest. She has a dream where Jareth comes to her at a [[masquerade ball]], proclaiming his love for her, but she rebuffs him and escapes, falling into a junkyard outside the Goblin City near Jareth's castle. An old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her, and she is rescued by Ludo and Sir Didymus. They are confronted by the humongous robotic gate guard, but Hoggle comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.\n\nJareth is alerted to the group's presence and sends his goblin army to stop them. Ludo summons a multitude of rocks to chase the goblins away, and they enter the castle. Sarah insists she must face Jareth alone and promises to call the others if needed. In a room modeled after [[M. C. Escher]]'s [[Relativity (M. C. Escher)|''Relativity'']], she confronts Jareth while trying to retrieve Toby. She recites the lines from her book that mirror her adventure to that point, but she still cannot remember the last line. Jareth offers Sarah her dreams again, but she remembers the line: \"You have no power over me!\" Jareth is defeated at the last second and returns Sarah and Toby home safely. He turns into the barn owl and flies away.\n\nSarah realizes how important Toby is to her. She gives him Lancelot and returns to her room as her father and stepmother return home. She sees her friends in the mirror and admits that, even though she has grown up, she still needs them in her life, whereupon the labyrinth characters appear in her room for a raucous reunion party. Jareth the Owl watches their celebration from outside and then flies into the moonlight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Bowie]] as [[Jareth]], the king of the goblins.\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Sarah Williams (Labyrinth)|Sarah Williams]], a 16-year-old<ref name=\"Cover\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Labyrinth (30th Anniversary Edition) |year=2016 |type=DVD/Blu-ray cover |publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] |quote=A 16-year-old girl is given 13 hours to solve a dangerous and wonderful labyrinth and rescue her baby brother...}}</ref> girl who searches through the labyrinth to find her baby brother Toby.\n* [[Toby Froud]] as Toby Williams, Sarah's baby half-brother.\n* [[Christopher Malcolm]] as Robert, Sarah and Toby's father.\n* [[Shelley Thompson]] as Irene, Toby's mother and Sarah's stepmother.\n* Juggler [[Michael Moschen]] is credited with performing Jareth's elaborate \"crystal-ball manipulation\", which Moschen had created for his stage performances and is now known as [[contact juggling]].

Jones has said that the finished film differs greatly from his original vision. Jones states that, \"I didn't feel that it was very much mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else.\" Jones has said that his version of the script was \"about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all.\" In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems \"all powerful to begin with\" and is actually using the Labyrinth to \"keep people from getting to his heart.\"<ref name=\"Python\"/>\n\nJones has said that Bowie's involvement in the project had a significant impact on the direction taken with the film. Jones had originally intended for the audience not to see the center of the Labyrinth, prior to Sarah's reaching it, as he felt that, in doing so, it robbed the film of a significant \"hook.\" Henson decided that he wanted Jareth to sing and appear throughout the film, which was something Jones considered the \"wrong\" decision, with the thought of Bowie starring in the film in mind. Despite his misgivings, Jones rewrote the script to allow for performing songs throughout the film. This draft of the script \"went away for about a year.\" During this time, it was redrafted first by Phillips and subsequently by Lucas.<ref name=\"Pirani\"/><ref name=\"Python\"/>\n\nAn early draft of the script attributed to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house in the guise of Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish her brother would be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this draft of the script. His final confrontation with Sarah tells her that he would \"much rather have a Queen\" than \"a little goblin prince.\" The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, and her blows transform him into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas, in the film, she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river [[Lethe]] in Greek myth is mentioned. As well as this, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas, in the film, there is none (though there is in the [[novelization]] by [[A. C. H.

Veteran performers [[Dave Goelz]] and [[Steve Whitmire]] operated various puppets in the film, along with [[Karen Prell]], Ron Mueck, and Rob Mills, who had all worked with Henson on ''Fraggle Rock''. [[Kevin Clash]], a crew member on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' best known for performing the character [[Elmo]], also worked on the film as various creatures, as did [[Frank Oz]], who performed briefly as the Wiseman (while also directing ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' around that time). Members of Henson's family also worked on the production, including son Brian (the voice and chief puppeteer for Hoggle) and daughter Cheryl (who assisted on one of the Fireys and is also credited for building the characters). Newcomers working on the production included puppeteers [[Anthony Asbury]], [[Angie Passmore]], [[Nigel Plaskitt]], and [[Mak Wilson]] (the latter three of whom are credited for performing goblins) who had previously worked on the satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Other goblin puppeteers included [[Kathryn Mullen]], [[David Rudman]], [[Robin Stevens]], [[Don Austen]], and, briefly, Jim Henson himself. [[Louise Gold]], a veteran Muppet performer who had gotten her start on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', cameos in the film as a masked dancer during the \"As the World Falls Down\" sequence, while [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] and [[Warwick Davis]], best-known as the performers of ''[[Star Wars|Star Wars']]'' [[R2-D2]] and [[Wicket W. Warrick]] respectively, were credited as some of the \"Goblin Corps\". \"Ambrosius\", Sir Didymus' canine steed, was voiced by [[Percy Edwards]], who had previously supplied the voice of \"Fizzgig\" in ''The Dark Crystal''.\n\n[[File:Lucas - Henson - 1986.jpg|thumb|right|Director [[Jim Henson]] and executive producer [[George Lucas]] on set during filming.<ref>{{harvp|Block|Erdmann|2016|page=171}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on April 15, 1985, at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]].<ref name=\"Shaft\">{{cite web |url=https://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/2014/05/551985/ |title=5/5/1985 \u2013 'To Amsterdam \u2013 (Filming Labyrinth) \u2013 Forest \u2013 Wild Things, Shaft of Hands.' |last=Henson |first=Jim |date=May 5, 1985 |work=Jim Henson's Red Book |access-date=January 13, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816015001/http://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/2014/05/551985/ |archive-date=August 16, 2014}}</ref> ''Labyrinth'' took five months to film and was a complicated shoot due to the various puppets and animatronic creatures involved. In the making-of documentary ''Inside the Labyrinth'', Henson stated that Jim Henson's Creature Shop had been building the puppets and characters required for around a year and a half, prior to shooting, but \"everything came together in the last couple weeks.\" Henson noted that, \"even if you have the characters together, the puppeteers start working with them, they find problems or they try to figure out what they're going to do with these characters.\"<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\nEach of the film's key puppets required a small team of puppeteers to operate it, but Hoggle was the most complex puppet of the production. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson (who also provided the character's voice and performed a few goblins) and three additional puppeteers. Brian Henson stated that Weiser \"does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other four members of the crew are all radio crew, myself included,\" in the ''Inside the Labyrinth'' documentary. Brian Henson also said of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle that, \"five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically, what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other.\"<ref name=\"Inside\"/> The film's big, ogre-like monster Ludo, whose original build weighed over 100 pounds, was similarly challenging. It would have been too exhausting for performer Ron Mueck to inhabit the 75-pound suit for all of his scenes, so Henson decided to have Mueck and Rob Mills exchange performances inside Ludo, as they had the same size and body shape.\n\nAt the early stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it difficult to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie said that, \"I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest, because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but from the side of the set or from behind you.\"<ref name=\"Bowie\"/> Connelly remarked that, \"it was a bit strange [working almost exclusively with puppets in the film], but I think both Dave [Bowie] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets, and, by the end of the film, it wasn't a challenge anymore. They were there, and they were their characters.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickholtz|first=Daniel|title=Jennifer Connelly \u2013 I Love to Do Daring Things!|journal=Teen Idols Mania!|year=1986|url=http://www.rattlebeak.com/go/writing/moviepeople/archivedicon/jennifer_article2.html|access-date=January 26, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806080511/http://www.rattlebeak.com/go/writing/moviepeople/archivedicon/jennifer_article2.html|archive-date=August 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe film required large and ambitious sets constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was thirty feet high, with a camera mounted on a forty-foot vertical camera track. Many grey, scaly hands integral to the scene were actually 150 live hands supplied by 75 performers and 200 foam-rubber hands.<ref name=\"Shaft\"/> Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene and spent time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\nThe set of the Goblin City was built on Stage 6 at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] near London and required the largest panoramic back-cloth ever made. Production designer [[Elliot Scott]] states that the biggest challenge he faced was building the forest Sarah and her party pass through on their way to Jareth's Castle. The film's production notes state that, \"the entire forest required 120 truckloads of tree branches, 1,200 turfs of grass, 850 pounds of dried leaves, 133 bags of [[lichen]], and 35 bundles of mossy [[Usnea|old man's beard]].\"<ref name=\"Production\"/>\n\nMost filming was conducted at Elstree Studios, while a small amount of location shooting was carried out in England and the U.S.. The park seen at the start of the film is West Wycombe Park in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.

Henson states that, \"When we hit the editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, I took it over again and did the next few months of post-production and audio.\" Henson went on to say that, \"When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight. I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story.
