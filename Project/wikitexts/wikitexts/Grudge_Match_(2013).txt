Stallone and De Niro have both previously been in successful boxing films (''[[Rocky]]'' and ''[[Raging Bull]]'', respectively) and worked together in ''[[Cop Land]]''.

Before they have a rematch, Razor announces his retirement without explanation, infuriating Kid and costing them a big payday.\n\nYears later, Razor is low on money and working in a shipyard when he is visited by promoter Dante Slate Jr., who wants Razor to provide a [[motion capture]] performance for a video game. It was Dante's father whose shady business dealings ended up leaving Razor in dire financial straits. The soft-spoken Razor wants no part of this stunt. Kid, a showoff who runs a bar and a car dealership, is all for it. Razor begrudgingly accepts $15,000 needed to care for his ailing former trainer Lightning Conlon and pay his overdue bills.\n\nAt the recording studio, Razor is surprised and taunted by Kid, who was also invited by Dante. The two get into a fight and damage the studio before being arrested. Cellphone footage of the fight is uploaded on [[YouTube]] and goes viral, giving Dante the idea of organizing a final grudge match between Razor and Kid, which he will promote as \"Grudgement Day\".\n\nKid eagerly accepts. Razor is forced to do so as well, not receiving his $15,000 and then learning he has been fired from the shipyard. At the press conference to announce the grudge match, Razor is approached by his ex-girlfriend Sally Rose, who cheated on him with Kid during their youth and ended up becoming pregnant. Now widowed, Sally wants to reconnect with Razor, but he is reluctant.\n\nRazor asks old trainer Lightning to get him back in shape. Kid expects gym owner Frankie Brite to train him, but Frankie mocks the fight and is of little help. Kid is approached by his estranged biological son, B. J., against Sally's wishes. The two begin to bond after B. J. gives Kid helpful advice regarding his technique, and is invited to be his trainer.\n\nLightning finds out Razor is blind in one eye. Realizing that a fight could cause permanent damage, Lightning and Sally both implore Razor to call it off, but he decides to go through with the fight.\n\nKid takes his grandson Trey to celebrate the news that the grudge match is sold out. B. J. believes they are going to a movie, but Kid takes the child to a bar, then leaves him on his own while hooking up with a groupie. Trey ends up accidentally starting Kid's car while he is in the backseat having sex. Kid prevents an accident, but he is arrested, and B. J. is infuriated that he endangered the boy. Kid apologizes to B. J. and gives him a scrapbook that he kept of B. J.'s sports career in school, proving he had not been disinterested in him throughout the years. B. J. forgives him.\n\nWhen the grudge match begins, Kid gains the upper hand, severely beating Razor by unknowingly exploiting his blind eye. Upon learning of Razor's condition, however, Kid stops focusing on the eye and helps Razor to his feet. Razor turns the fight to his favor, but likewise helps Kid on his feet after nearly knocking him out. The fight ends and the judges decide it on points. Razor is declared the winner by a very close split decision. He celebrates with Sally and Lightning, while a satisfied Kid enjoys the company of B. J. and Trey, who are proud of what he has accomplished.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Razor has a new TV, on which he and Lightning view a performance by Kid on  ''Dancing with the Stars'' and quickly deduce that he is having sex with his partner. In another, Dante tries to set up another grudge match between [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Evander Holyfield]]. Holyfield refuses several increasingly higher offers to fight Tyson before showing interest when Slate offers Holyfield a role in a fourth ''[[The Hangover (film series)|Hangover]]'' film. Tyson, frustrated by this, approaches Dante angrily before the scene ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Cast as billed per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Roles as listed in the Cast list in film -->\n<!-- Actors billed 1 per screen -->\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Henry \"Razor\" Sharp\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Billy \"The Kid\" McDonnen\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Dante Slate Jr.\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Louis \"Lightning\" Conlon\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Sally Rose\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as B.
