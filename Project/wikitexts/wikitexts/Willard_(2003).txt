Lee Ermey]] and [[Laura Harring|Laura Elena Harring]]. It is loosely based on the novel ''[[Ratman's Notebooks]]'' by [[Stephen Gilbert (novelist)|Stephen Gilbert]], as well as on the novel's first film adaptation, ''[[Willard (1971 film)|Willard]]'' (1971), and its sequel, ''[[Ben (film)|Ben]]'' (1972). It was not billed as a [[remake]] by the producers, who chose instead to present it as a reworking of the themes from the original with a stronger focus on suspense.<ref>[http://www.willardmovie.com/%c2%a0 Willard] Official Movie Site</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nSocial misfit Willard Stiles, who cares for his ill and fragile but verbally abusive mother Henrietta in a musty old [[mansion]], is constantly humiliated and mercilessly taunted in front of his co-workers by his vicious and cruel boss, Frank Martin, who took over the Stiles family company after Willard's father Alfred committed suicide in 1995. After discovering and failing to exterminate a growing rat colony in the basement, Willard befriends and quickly becomes obsessed with a white rat he names [[Socrates]], considering him his only friend.\n\nAt work, Martin locks Willard in the elevator, though Willard's sympathetic co-worker Cathryn eventually releases him. That evening, he watches Socrates begin tearing up a newspaper, prompting him to train the now expansive horde of rats, including Ben, a large [[Gambian pouched rat]] who envies Willard's favoritism towards Socrates. After training the rats sufficiently, Willard takes them to Martin's home and orders them to chew up the tires on Martin's new [[Mercedes-Benz]]. The next day at work, Willard gleefully watches Martin arrive late and tired. While Willard explains to the rats that they must move out, Henrietta overhears him, assuming he plans to get rid of her. Startled by noises from the basement, Willard finds her dead the next morning, having fallen down the basement stairs. At the wake, Willard learns that Henrietta refinanced the family home to pay off Alfred's debts and that the bank will likely foreclose upon the property.\n\nIn Henrietta's bedroom, Willard finds an envelope from the coroner's office containing the effects found on Alfred's body, including the still-bloody pocket knife he evidently committed suicide with. Distraught, Willard attempts suicide with the knife until Socrates stops him. Attempting to comfort Willard, Cathryn describes her own mother's death and gives him a pet cat, whose own mother helped Cathryn to grieve. Willard reluctantly takes it, with Socrates safely stowed in his pocket. In a scene set to the title song from the movie ''[[Ben (1972 film)|Ben]]'', the rats, who have taken over the entire house, pursue and fatally overpower the cat.\n\nDesperately lonely, Willard starts bringing Socrates to work with him. Despite a contract written by Alfred stipulating that he remain employed by the family company, Willard finds a note at his desk from Martin declaring that he is being fired. While Willard desperately argues with Martin, Martin's secretary Barbara Leach discovers Socrates in the supply room. Her screams alert Martin, who fatally bludgeons Socrates as Willard helplessly watches. Willard finally snaps and hatches a plan to avenge Socrates with Ben. Loading the numerous rats into a company van, he confronts Martin and orders them to swarm upon Martin and kill him. \n\nAt home, Willard kills the remaining colony before rat-proofing his entire house. Exhausted after the night's events, he is finally awoken by the doorbell. Terrified by the shadows of two policemen, he remains standing in the hallway until the evening, seemingly feverish. Cathryn appears, informing Willard that Martin's body was found and that rumors had arisen that he was either murdered or eaten by animals. Coming face-to-face with Ben, Willard tries to leave the house before realizing that the rats have chewed out his car tires. Accosted by the two policemen, Willard retreats into the house and frantically attempts to prevent the rats from entering. Trapping himself in the kitchen, Willard is confronted by Ben, whom he tries to kill with a mouse trap.\n\nBelieving Willard is insane, and aghast at the rat infestation, the police leave to call the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]] and health department. When Cathryn tries to enter the house, they warn her against entering, asking whether she wants to be eaten alive. Horrified, she connects the rats to Martin's death and realizes Willard's complicity. Ben viciously attacks Willard as he tries to escape. The police officers and Cathryn look on as Willard, outlined in the upstairs window, kills Ben with his father's pocket knife.\n\nThe final scene reveals Willard in a psychiatric hospital, seemingly semicatatonic and refusing to eat. A white rat appears in his cell, crawling into Willard's sleeve as Socrates used to. Believing that his friend has been reincarnated, Willard joyfully drops his semicatatonic state and begins telling the rat his plans for an escape.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Willard Stiles, a lonely outcast who is constantly abused by his boss Frank Martin, whom he feels stole the manufacturing business built by his father, and his beloved mother. He befriends a colony of rats, especially a white rat named Socrates and a large rat named Ben, though the latter soon becomes an antagonist. When Socrates is killed by Martin, he uses his rats to get revenge.\n* [[R. Lee Ermey]] as Frank Martin, the cruel and psychopathic CEO of Martin-Stiles Manufacturing. He constantly insults and humiliates Willard for arriving late to work, and seems set on firing Willard and seizing his house, but is eventually eaten alive by Willard's rats.\n* [[Laura Harring|Laura Elena Harring]] as Cathryn, one of Willard's co-workers, who sympathizes with him and comforts him after his mother's death. She quits her job in solidarity for the ill-treated Willard, although she later discovers his involvement in Martin's death.\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Henrietta Stiles, Willard's ill yet verbally abusive mother. Frail and eccentric, she berates her son for being single and feels that his life has been wasted. She is nevertheless anxious over her son, presumably related to the suicide of his father several years before. \n* [[Ashlyn Gere|Kimberly Patton]] as Barbara Leach, Frank Martin's cynical secretary who is often rude and passive-aggressive to both Willard and Cathryn.\n* William S. Taylor as Joseph Garter, a trustee of the Stiles estate who informs Willard of his dire financial situation after his mother's death.\n* [[Ty Olsson]] as Officer Salmon, a policeman who tries to talk to Willard, presumably regarding Frank Martin's death. He asserts unambiguously that Willard is \"nuts\".\n\n[[Bruce Davison]], who portrayed Willard in the [[Willard (1971 film)|original 1971 film]], makes a non-acting [[cameo appearance]] as Willard's late father, Alfred Benjamin Stiles, in a portrait above the house's fireplace.\n\n== Release ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened at number eight at the U.S. box office, grossing [[United States dollar|US$]]4,010,593 It fell to 13 the following week, and finished with $6,886,089 in domestic box office and $1,660,577 in foreign box office.\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n<!-- {{expand section|date=July 2016}} -->\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 64% based on reviews from 129 critics.
