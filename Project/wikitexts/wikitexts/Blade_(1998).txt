The film stars [[Wesley Snipes]] as the titular character with [[Stephen Dorff]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[N'Bushe Wright]] in supporting roles.

Doctors are able to save her baby, but the woman dies.\n\nThirty years later, the child has become the [[vampire hunter]], [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Blade]], who is a human-vampire [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] that possesses the supernatural abilities of the vampires without any of their weaknesses, except for the requirement to consume human blood. Blade raids a [[rave|rave club]] owned by the vampire [[Deacon Frost]]. Police take one of the vampires to the hospital, where he kills Dr. Curtis Webb and feeds on [[hematologist]] Karen Jenson, and escapes. Blade takes Karen to a safe house where she is treated by his old friend [[Abraham Whistler]]. Whistler explains that he and Blade have been waging a secret war against vampires using weapons based on their elemental weaknesses, such as sunlight, silver, and garlic. As Karen is now \"marked\" by the bite of a vampire, both he and Blade tell her to leave the city.\n\nAt a meeting of the council of pure-blood vampire elders, Frost, the leader of a faction of younger vampires, is rebuked for trying to incite war between vampires and humans. As Frost and his kind are not natural-born vampires, they are considered socially inferior. Meanwhile, returning to her apartment, Karen is attacked by police officer Krieger, who is a [[familiar]], a human loyal to vampires. Blade subdues Krieger and uses information from him to locate an archive that contains pages from the \"vampire bible\".\n\nKrieger informs Frost of what happened, and Frost kills Krieger. Frost also has one of the elders executed and strips the others of their authority, in response to the earlier disrespect shown him at the council of vampires. Meanwhile Blade comes upon Pearl, a morbidly obese vampire, and tortures him with a UV light into revealing that Deacon wants to command a ritual where he would use 12 pure-blood vampires to awaken the \"blood god\" La Magra; and Blade's blood is the key.\n\nLater, at the hideout, Blade injects himself with a special serum that suppresses his urge to drink blood. However, the serum is beginning to lose its effectiveness due to overuse. While experimenting with the anticoagulant [[EDTA#Medicine|EDTA]] as a possible replacement, Karen discovers that it explodes when combined with vampire blood. She manages to synthesize a vaccine that can cure the infected but learns that it will not work on Blade. Karen is confident that she can cure Blade's bloodthirst but it would take her years of treating it.\n\nFrost and his men attack the hideout, infect Whistler, and abduct Karen. When Blade returns, he helps Whistler commit suicide. When Blade attempts to rescue Karen from Frost's penthouse, he is shocked to find his still-alive mother, who reveals that she came back the night she was attacked and was brought in by Frost, who appears and reveals himself as the vampire who bit her. Blade is then subdued and taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost plans to perform the summoning ritual for La Magra. Karen is thrown into a pit to be devoured by Webb, who has transformed into a decomposing [[zombie]]-like creature. Karen injures Webb and escapes. Blade is drained of his blood, but Karen allows him to drink from her, enabling him to recover. Frost completes the ritual and obtains the powers of La Magra. Blade confronts Frost after killing all of his minions, including his mother. During their fight, Blade injects Frost with all of the syringes; the overdose of EDTA causes his body to inflate and explode, killing him.\n\nKaren offers to help Blade cure himself; instead, he asks her to create an improved version of the serum, so he can continue his crusade against vampires. In a brief [[epilogue]], Blade confronts a vampire in [[Moscow]].\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as [[Blade (New Line franchise character)|Eric Brooks / Blade]]: A half-vampire \"daywalker\" who hunts vampires.

The comic Blade used [[teakwood]] knives and was much more the everyman in his behavior and attitude. Though courageous and brave, he displayed flaws as well, such as an inability to get along with certain other supporting cast members and a hatred of vampires that bordered on fanaticism.\n\nThe character was not originally a \"daywalker\" but a human being immune to being turned into a vampire. Lacking the superhuman speed and strength of his undead quarry, he relied solely on his wits and skill until he was bitten by the character [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]] as seen in [[Peter Parker: Spider-Man#Volume Two (1999\u20132003)|''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'']] #8, first published in August 1999. The film portrayal of Blade was updated for a 1990s audience and the comics character was subsequently modified to match. Goyer replaced the daggers Blade used in the comics with a sword and gave him a more [[samurai]]-like aesthetic.<ref name=\"Otto\" /> The film's version of Deacon Frost also differs greatly from his comic counterpart. He was older with white hair and literally a church deacon, but the film retains Frost's upstart ambitions.<ref name=\"Otto\">{{cite web |date=1 March 2004 |last=Otto |first=Jeff |title=An Interview with David S.

It had a disastrous test screening with audiences. Heavy edits and re-shoots were implemented which delayed the release date for more than half a year. The most significant change was the addition of the final sword fight between Blade and Deacon Frost, which did not exist in the original cut. In the original ending, Frost turned into La Magra and became a large swirling mass of blood instead of keeping his form. This was scrapped because the filmmakers could not get the special effects to look right. It can be seen as a special feature on the DVD. [[Stan Lee]] originally had a cameo that was ultimately cut from the film. He played one of the cops that came into the blood club during the aftermath and discover Quinn's body on fire. The scene where Karen and Deacon are talking about the cure for vampirism initially ran slightly longer and answered the question of how the vampires would feed if everybody was turned into a vampire. They would keep some humans alive in giant blood bags to harvest them. The bags can still be seen in a doorway during the scene, and later played an integral part of the plot in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 30, 1998 |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/928 |title=BLADE test screenings |author=staff |work=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |archive-date=February 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216002309/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/928 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMarvel was not going to give [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Gene Colan]] credit for the characters they had created, but Goyer insisted.
