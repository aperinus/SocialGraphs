The film tells the story of a group of actors in [[Montreal]] who perform a [[Passion play]] in a Quebec church (the film uses the grounds of [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]] on [[Mount Royal]]), combining religious belief with unconventional theories on a [[historical Jesus]]. As the church turns against the main actor and author of the play, his life increasingly mirrors the story of [[Jesus]], and the film adapts numerous stories from the [[New Testament]].\n\nThe film came out to critical acclaim and won numerous awards, including the [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Genie Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film was also nominated for the 1989 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Critics in the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] have regarded the film as one of the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Montreal]], an unknown actor named Daniel is hired by a Roman Catholic site of pilgrimage (\"le sanctuaire\") to present a [[Passion play]] in its gardens. The priest, Father Leclerc, asks him to \"modernize\" the classic play the church has been using, which he considers dated. Despite working with material others consider to be clich\u00e9d, Daniel is inspired and carries out intensive academic research, consulting [[archaeology]] to check the [[historicity of Jesus]] and drawing on supposed information on [[Jesus in the Talmud]], using the Talmud name Yeshua Ben Pantera for Jesus, whom he portrays. He also includes arguments that the biological father of Jesus was a Roman soldier who left Palestine shortly after impregnating the unwed [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]. He assembles his cast, found from insignificant and disreputable backgrounds, and moves in with two of them, Constance and Mireille.\n\nWhen the play is performed, it receives excellent reviews from critics but is regarded as unconventional and controversial by Father Leclerc, who angrily distances himself from Daniel. Daniel's life is further complicated when he attends one of Mireille's auditions. Mireille is told to remove her top, causing an outburst from Daniel in which he damages lights and cameras, resulting in him facing criminal charges. When the higher authorities of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] strongly object to his Biblical interpretation and security forcibly stops a performance, the audience and actors object and he is injured in an ensuing accident.\n\nDaniel is first taken by ambulance to a Catholic hospital where he is neglected. He leaves and collapses on a [[Montreal Metro]] platform. The same ambulance takes him to the [[Jewish General Hospital]]. Despite immediate, skilled, and energetic efforts by the doctors and nurses, he is pronounced [[Brain death|brain-dead]]. His doctor asks for the consent of his friends, since he has no known relatives, to take his organs for donation. His physician states that they would have been able to save him if he had been brought to them half an hour earlier. After his death, his eyes and heart are used to restore the health of other patients.\n\nIn the wake of his death, Daniel's friends start a theatre company to carry on his work.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!
