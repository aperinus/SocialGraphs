based on the [[Silence (End\u014d novel)|1966 novel of the same name]] by [[Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d]]. The film stars [[Andrew Garfield]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], and [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]]. The plot follows two 17th-century [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] priests who travel from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] to [[Edo period|Edo-era Japan]] via [[Macau]] to locate their missing mentor and [[Christianity in the 17th century|spread Catholic Christianity]]. The story is set in a time when it was common for the faith's [[Japan]]ese adherents to hide from the persecution that resulted from the suppression of [[Christianity in Japan]] after the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] (1637\u20131638) against the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. These are now called the ''[[kakure kirishitan]]'', or \"hidden Christians\". It is the second filmed adaptation of End\u014d's novel, following a [[Silence (1971 film)|1971 film of the same name]].\n\nThe pre-production phase of the filmmaking for ''Silence'' went through a cycle of over two decades of setbacks and reassessments. After filming of ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' concluded in January 2013, Scorsese committed to following it up with ''Silence''. On April 19, 2013, Scorsese indicated that he would begin production on ''Silence'' in 2014. [[Irwin Winkler]] was then announced as a producer, as were [[Randall Emmett]] and [[George Furla]], who would provide financing through their company [[Emmett/Furla Films]]. Soon thereafter, planning was made for the film to be shot in Taiwan.\n\nA long-time passion project for Scorsese, which he had developed for over 25 years, the film premiered in Rome on November 29, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 23, 2016. It received critical acclaim, with both the [[National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute]] selecting ''Silence'' as one of their top ten films of the year. It also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]]. However, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $22 million against its $50 million budget. ''Silence'' is the third of Scorsese's films about religious figures struggling with challenges of faith, following [[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|''The Last Temptation of Christ'']] (1988) and ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997).\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:El Greco - The Veil of St Veronica - WGA10461.jpg|thumb|upright|Rodrigues visualizes the face of Christ in the [[Veil of Veronica]] form painted by [[El Greco]].]]\n[[File:Yangmingshan Taiwan hot springs.jpg|thumb|upright|An active [[fumarole]] at [[Yangmingshan]], [[Taiwan]].]]\n[[File:Jesus on cross to step on.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fumi-e]] bearing an image of Christ, similar to the one portrayed in the film.]]\n\nIn the opening scene, veteran Portuguese Jesuit priest Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira helplessly witnesses the torture of Japanese converts he had been trying to bring to the Christian faith.\n\nA few years later, at [[St. Paul's College, Macau|St. Paul's College]] in [[Macau]], an Italian Jesuit priest, [[Alessandro Valignano]], receives news that Ferreira renounced his faith in Japan. In disbelief, Ferreira's Portuguese pupils, the young Jesuit priests Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, set off to find him, guided by Kichijir\u014d, a fisherman stranded in Macau. Kichijir\u014d's family was killed for being Christian and he renounced his faith to save himself.\n\nArriving in the Japanese village of Tomogi, the priests find local Christian populations driven underground in fear of \"the Inquisitor.\" The village hides the two priests but they are horrified when officials of the shogunate arrive to ferret out hidden Christians and force them to step on a [[fumi-e]], a carved image of Christ. The villagers who refuse are tortured until they drown and the bodies are cremated to prevent Christian burials. Garupe leaves for [[Hirado Island]] and Rodrigues to [[Got\u014d-rett\u014d|Got\u014d Island]], the last place Ferreira was seen. He finds the village destroyed and Kichijir\u014d betrays him to the authorities. Rodrigues is taken to [[Nagasaki]], where he is imprisoned. Rodrigues is forced by the Inquisitor, Inoue Masashige, to watch guards kill the other prisoners at the shoreline. He is shocked to see an emaciated Garupe among them; as the prisoners are drowned to get Garupe to renounce his faith, Garupe refuses, instead trying to rescue the prisoners. He drowns with them in the process. Rodrigues' faith in God is shaken. When Kichijir\u014d is imprisoned alongside him, Rodrigues reluctanctly takes his [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]].\n\nRodrigues is taken to meet Ferreira, now living in Japan under a Japanese name with a wife and son. Ferreira apostatized while being [[ana-tsurushi|tortured]] to stop the Japanese from torturing the other prisoners. That night, Rodrigues is brought to watch five Christians being tortured. They have already apostatized but are to remain in the pit until Rodrigues renounces his own faith. Rodrigues struggles over whether it is self-centered to refuse to recant when doing so will end others' suffering. He hears the voice of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], giving him permission to step on the [[fumi-e]], and he does.\n\nIn the end, Rodrigues becomes like Ferreira; he takes a Japanese name and family. The ex-priests use their knowledge of Christianity to stop Dutch traders from smuggling Christian paraphenalia into [[Dejima]]. Rodrigues hears the voice of Jesus, who assures him that rather than remaining silent as Rodrigues had thought, Jesus also suffered alongside those who were killed.\n\nDespite having apostatized, Rodrigues is still subject to regular testing by Japanese officials to ensure he does not practice in secret. Kichijir\u014d is caught with a Christian amulet and taken away, never heard from again. Rodrigues lives out the remainder of his life in Japan. After his death, his body is cremated according to traditional Japanese rites. His wife is allowed to place an offering in his hand to ward off evil spirits - she places the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given to him when he first came to Tomogi, indicating that in his heart, Rodrigues remained a Christian all his life.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Andrew Garfield by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Star Wars- The Last Jedi Japan Premiere Red Carpet- Adam Driver (27163437599) (cropped).jpg\n| width2 = 165\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Andrew Garfield]] and [[Adam Driver]] portray the two Jesuit priests searching for Ferreira.\n}}\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues (based on [[Giuseppe Chiara]]), who later in the film goes by the name Okada San'emon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/martin-scorsese-casts-andrew-garfield-and-ken-watanabe-in-silence |title=Martin Scorsese Casts Andrew Garfield and Ken Watanabe in 'Silence' |work=slashfilm.com |date=May 7, 2013 |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140303203322/http://www.slashfilm.com/martin-scorsese-casts-andrew-garfield-and-ken-watanabe-in-silence/ |archive-date=March 3, 2014}}</ref> In interviews, Garfield has spoken of his extensive year-long preparation for the role with [[James Martin (priest, born 1960)|James Martin]], a practicing Jesuit priest working in New York.

In 2011, Scorsese ostensibly agreed to one more deal, delaying ''Silence'' to direct ''Hugo''. Cecchi Gori Pictures asserted that Scorsese agreed to pay \"substantial compensation and other valuable benefits\" in order to first direct ''The Departed'', ''Shutter Island'', and ''Hugo''. The company said the fees were \"$1&nbsp;million to $1.5&nbsp;million per film plus up to 20 percent of Scorsese's backend compensation\". The complaint was founded on the company's allegation that Scorsese failed to pay the fees agreed upon for ''Hugo'', and that he breached the contract's terms by filming ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' ahead of ''Silence''. Scorsese, via his representatives, responded, \"The claims asserted are completely contradicted by, inconsistent with, and contrary to the express terms of an agreement entered into by the parties last year.\" He also denounced the lawsuit as a \"media stunt\" and a \"meritless action\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/martin-scorsese-movies-lawsuit-cecchi-gori-364934 |title=Martin Scorsese Sued by Producer Cecchi Gori over Alleged Deal to Direct 'Silence' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 22, 2012 |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321152122/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/martin-scorsese-movies-lawsuit-cecchi-gori-364934 |archive-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref> The lawsuit was settled on January 17, 2014.

With the weather constantly changing, he would have inconsistencies in terms of lighting that he solved by filming some sequences at night time that would be lit for either dusk or sunset.

Montevecchio of the [[University of Notre Dame]] published a theological assessment of the spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: \"This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumi-e makes clear that ''Silence'' is as much about the object of Christian faith as it is the experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of ''Silence'' is one of utter ''[[kenosis]]'' (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that ''kenosis'' radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijir\u014d.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Montevechio |first=Cesar |title=Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' is an anguished masterwork of spiritual inquiry |url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1908&context=jrf&sei-redir=1&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D10%26q%3Dsilence%2Bscorsese%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C14%26as_ylo%3D2016#search=%22silence%20scorsese%22 |work=Journal of Religion & Film |date=April 1, 2017 |access-date=July 31, 2017 |archive-date=August 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804132228/http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1908&context=jrf&sei-redir=1&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D10%26q%3Dsilence%2Bscorsese%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C14%26as_ylo%3D2016#search=%22silence%20scorsese%22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAaron Baker in his book ''A Companion to Martin Scorsese'' discussed aspects of the theological themes in the film stating that: \"According to an analysis of the novel by the Japanese-American theologian Fumitaka Masuoka, it pivots on the idea that the ''silence'' of God is in fact the ''message'' of God, being not the silence of ''nihil'', or 'nothingness', but rather 'the \"accompaniment\" for the forsaken and the suffering', and the concomitant silence of Christians quietly hoping for salvation. Implicit here is what Matsuoka terms 'an element of uncertainty', a possibility that the ''nihil'' of emptiness, meaninglessness, and hopelessness will eventually prevail. Uncertainty about the fate of the soul (or the self, for secularists) lies at the heart of human experience, injecting many a mind with the existential [[Fear and Trembling|fear, trembling]], and [[Sickness Unto Death|sickness unto death]] of which [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] vividly wrote.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Aaron |title=Not nihil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNNLBAAAQBAJ&q=silence+scorsese&pg=PT168 |work=A Companion to Martin Scorsese |date=April 1, 2016 |isbn=9781118588369 |access-date=July 31, 2017 |archive-date=April 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421200659/https://books.google.com/books?id=aNNLBAAAQBAJ&q=silence+scorsese&pg=PT168 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Silence (1971 film)|''Silence'' (1971 film)]], a Japanese film adaptation of Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d's novel, directed by [[Masahiro Shinoda]].\n* ''[[Black Robe (film)|Black Robe]]'', a 1991 Canadian film based on the novel by Brian Moore which deals with similar issues in 17th century Quebec.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20171213150439/http://www.silencemovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0490215}}\n* {{Mojo title|silence2016}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|silence_2016}}\n\n{{Martin Scorsese|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2016 films]]\n[[Category:2016 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:American historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films about Catholic priests]]\n[[Category:Films about Christianity]]\n[[Category:Films based on Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Martin Scorsese]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Martin Scorsese]]\n[[Category:Films set in feudal Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1630s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1640s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1660s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 17th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Macau]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Edo period]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jay Cocks]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Martin Scorsese]]\n[[Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture]]\n[[Category:Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Jesuit history in Asia]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Daiei Studio films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Persecution of Christians]]\n[[Category:Society of Jesus]]\n[[Category:StudioCanal films]]"}]}}}}
