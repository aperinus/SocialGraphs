John. ''World Film Directors, Volume 2.'' The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. pp. 746.</ref> According to Barth David Schwartz's book ''Pasolini Requiem'' (1992), the impetus for the film took place in 1962. Pasolini had accepted [[Pope John XXIII]]'s invitation for a new dialogue with non-Catholic artists, and subsequently visited the town of [[Assisi]] to attend a seminar at a [[Franciscan]] monastery there. The papal visit caused traffic jams in the town, leaving Pasolini confined to his hotel room; there, he came across a copy of the [[New Testament]]. Pasolini read all [[Canonical Gospels|four Gospels]] straight through, and he claimed that adapting a film from one of them \"threw in the shade all the other ideas for work I had in my head.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040314/REVIEWS08/403140301/1023|title=The Gospel According to St. Matthew|author=Roger Ebert|date=14 March 2004|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref> Unlike previous cinematic depictions of Jesus' life, Pasolini's film does not embellish the [[the life of Jesus in the New Testament|biblical account]] with any literary or dramatic inventions, nor does it present [[Gospel harmony|an amalgam]] of the four Gospels (subsequent films which would adhere as closely as possible to one Gospel account are 1979's ''[[Jesus (1979 film)|Jesus]]'', based on the Gospel of Luke, and 2003's ''[[The Gospel of John (film)|The Gospel of John]]''). Pasolini stated that he decided to \"remake the Gospel by analogy\" and the film's sparse dialogue all comes directly from the Bible.<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 746\">Wakeman. pp. 746.</ref>\n\nGiven Pasolini's well-known reputation as an [[atheist]], a [[homosexual]], and a [[Marxist]], the reverential nature of the film came as a surprise, especially after the controversy of ''La ricotta''. At a press conference in 1966, Pasolini was asked why he, an unbeliever, had made a film which dealt with religious themes; his response was, \"If you know that I am an unbeliever, then you know me better than I do myself. I may be an unbeliever, but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaseekers.com/Pasolinitext.html|title=Pasolini|publisher=Cinemaseekers.com|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref> Therefore, he sets his criticism against a backdrop of sheer religious concern for the role assumed by the Church, the organization, for centuries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Martellini|first=Luigi|date=2006|title=Pier Paolo Pasolini; Retrato de un intelectual|location=Valencia|publisher=Universitat de Valencia|pages=119\u2013120|isbn=978-84-370-7928-8}}</ref>\n\nOn the idea of analogy, Pasolini emphasized his intention of not reproducing exactly a historic, casual Christ, but projecting the present-day society of southern Italy onto that figure, a Christ after 2,000 years of narrative build-up. As he explained,\n\n<blockquote>Along with this method of reconstruction by analogy, we find the idea of myth and epics [...] so when narrating the history of Christ, I did not reconstruct Christ such as he actually was. If I had reconstructed Christ's history as it actually was, I would not have made a religious film, since I am not a believer. I do not think Christ was God's son. I would have made a positivist or Marxist reconstruction if any, so at the best of cases, a life of one of the five or six thousands saints preaching at that moment in Palestine. However, I did not want to do that, I am not interested in profanations: that is just a fashion I loathe, it is petit bourgeois. I want to consecrate things again, because that is possible, I want to re-mythologize them. I did not want to reconstruct the life of Christ as it really was, I wanted to make the history of Christ plus two thousand years of Christian storytelling about the life of Christ, since it is the two thousands years of Christian history that have mythologized this biography, one that as such would have been virtually insignificant otherwise. My film is the life of Christ after two thousands years of stories on the life of Christ. That is what I had in mind.<ref>{{cite book |last=Martellini|first=Luigi|date=2006|title=Pier Paolo Pasolini; Retrato de un intelectual|location=Valencia|publisher=Universitat de Valencia|pages=117\u2013118|isbn=978-84-370-7928-8}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe film was dedicated to John XXIII.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thomson|first=Ian|date=2013-02-23|title=Pier Paolo Pasolini: No saint |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/22/pier-paolo-pasolini|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=2015-10-09}}</ref> The announcement at the opening credits reads that it is ''\"dedicato alla cara, lieta, familiare memoria di Giovanni XXIII\"'' (''\"dedicated to the dear, joyous, familiar memory of Pope John XXIII\"''). Pasolini was particularly critical with the new [[Pope Paul VI]] (1963), at a moment when he was drafting a storyboard for a follow-up to the film, this time on [[Paul the Apostle]]. The project due for 1966\u20131967 never took off, but it was advanced.<ref>On the new draft film, he went as follows: \"The film is an extremely violent action against the Church and the Vatican, since I put together a double-sided Paul, i.e. schizophrenic, clearly dislocated into two: one is a saint [...] while the other is a priest, an ex-Pharisaic, one that retrieves his former cultural status and founds the Church. Hence my condemnation; as a mystic he is fine, it is a mystical experience like any other, respectable, I am not judging that, but I do condemn him firmly as the founder of the Church, with all the negative elements inherent to it: sexophobia, anti-Feminism, the organization, the collects, triumphalism, moralism. To sum up, all the things that have made the Church a bad thing.\" See Martellini, L. 2006, p. 119.</ref>\n\n===Filming and style===\nPasolini employed many of the techniques of [[Italian neorealism]] in the making of his film. Most of the actors he hired were non-professionals. [[Enrique Irazoqui]] ([[Jesus]]) was a 19-year-old economics student from [[Spain]] and a communist activist, while the rest of the cast were mainly locals from [[Barile]], [[Matera]], and [[Massafra]], where the film was shot (Pasolini visited the Holy Land but found the locations unsuitable and \"commercialized\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0059741/|title=Sopralluoghi in Palestina per il vangelo secondo Matteo (1965)|author=lchadbou-326-26592|date=11 July 1965|publisher=IMDb|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref> His location scouting in the Holy Land is documented in the adjoining feature-length documentary [[Location Hunting in Palestine]], released a year later. Pasolini cast his own mother, Susanna, as the elderly [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|mother of Jesus]]. The cast also included noted intellectuals such as writers [[Enzo Siciliano]] and [[Alfonso Gatto]], poets [[Natalia Ginzburg]] and [[J. Rodolfo Wilcock|Rodolfo Wilcock]], and philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. In addition to the original biblical source, Pasolini used references to \"2,000 years of Christian painting and sculptures\" throughout the film. The look of the characters is also eclectic and, in some cases, anachronistic, resembling artistic depictions of different eras (the costumes of the [[Roman soldier]]s and the [[Pharisees]], for example, are influenced by [[Renaissance art]], whereas Jesus' appearance has been likened to that in [[Byzantine art]] as well as the work of [[Expressionist]] artist [[Georges Rouault]]).<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 746\"/> Pasolini later described the film as \"the life of Christ plus 2,000 years of storytelling about the life of Christ.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 747\">Wakeman. pp. 747.</ref>\n\nPasolini described his experience filming ''The Gospel According to Matthew'' as very different from his previous films. He stated that while his shooting style on his previous film ''[[Accattone]]'' was \"reverential,\" when his shooting style was applied to a biblical source it \"came out rhetorical. ... And then when I was shooting the baptism scene near Viterbo I threw over all my technical preconceptions. I started using the zoom, I used new camera movements, new frames which were not reverential, but almost documentary [combining] an almost classical severity with the moments that are almost [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godardian]], for example in the two trials of Christ shot like '[[cinema verite]].' ... The Point is that ... I, a non-believer, was telling the story through the eyes of a believer. The mixture at the narrative level produced the mixture stylistically.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 746\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe score of the film, arranged by [[Luis Bacalov|Luis Enr\u00edquez Bacalov]], is [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]]; ranging from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (e.g. ''[[Mass in B Minor]]'' and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'') to [[Odetta]] (\"[[Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child]]\"), to [[Blind Willie Johnson]] (\"[[Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground]]\"), to the Jewish ceremonial declaration \"[[Kol Nidre]]\" and the \"[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]\" from the Congolese ''[[Missa Luba]].'' Pasolini stated that all of the film's music was of a sacred or religious nature from all parts of the world and multiple cultures or belief systems.<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 746\"/> Bacalov also composed several original musical tracks.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File: Aldo Moro, Pier Paolo Pasolini - Venezia 1964.jpg|thumb|Italian Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]] and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] together in [[Venice film festival|Venice]] at the premiere of the movie in 1964.]]\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including several Christian critics. [[Philip French]] called it \"a noble film,\" and [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]] said that \"it grips the historical and psychological imagination like no other religious film I have seen. And for all its apparent simplicity, it is visually rich and contains strange, disturbing hints and undertones about Christ and his mission.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 747\"/>\n\nSome Marxist film critics, however, wrote unfavorable reviews. Oswald Stack criticized the film's \"abject concessions to [[reactionary]] ideology.\" In response to criticism from the left, Pasolini admitted that, in his opinion, \"there are some horrible moments I am ashamed of. ... The Miracle of [[Miracle of the loaves and fishes#The Feeding of the 5.2C000|the loaves and the fishes]] and [[Jesus walking on water|Christ walking on water]] are disgusting [[Pietism]].\" He also stated that the film was \"a reaction against the conformity of Marxism. The mystery of life and death and of suffering \u2013 and particularly of religion ... is something that Marxists do not want to consider. But these are and have always been questions of great importance for human beings.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 747\"/>\n\n''The Gospel According to Matthew'' was ranked number 10 (in 2010) and number 7 (in 2011) in the ''Arts and Faith'' website's Top 100 Films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsandfaith.com/t100/thegospelaccordingtomatthew.html|title=Arts & Faith Top 100: The Gospel According to Matthew|publisher=Arts & Faith|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref> also is in the [[Vatican's list of films|Vatican's list of 45 great films]] and [[Roger Ebert]]'s Great Movies list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml|title=USCCB \u2013 (Film and Broadcasting) \u2013 Vatican Best Films List|publisher=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]|access-date=3 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422064928/http://old.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml|archive-date=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-gospel-according-to-st-matthew-1964|title=The Gospel According to St. Matthew Movie Review (1964)|author=Roger Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=14 March 2004|publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 92%, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 8.6 out of 10, with the critics consensus saying \"''The Gospel According to St. Matthew'' forgoes the pageantry of biblical epics in favor of a naturalistic retelling of the Christ story, achieving a respectful if not reverent interpretation with political verve.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|gospel_according_to_st_matthew|The Gospel According to St. Matthew}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nAt the [[25th Venice International Film Festival]], ''The Gospel According to Matthew'' was screened in competition for the Golden Lion, and won the OCIC Award and the Silver Lion.
