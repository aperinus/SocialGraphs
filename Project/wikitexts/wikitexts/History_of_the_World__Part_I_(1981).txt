Brooks also stars in the film, playing five roles: [[Moses]], Comicus the [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] philosopher, [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]], [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]], and Jacques, ''le gar\u00e7on de pisse''. The large [[ensemble cast]] also features [[Sid Caesar]], [[Shecky Greene]], [[Gregory Hines]] (in his film debut), [[Charlie Callas]]; and Brooks regulars [[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Harvey Korman]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Andreas Voutsinas]], and [[Spike Milligan]].\n\nThe film also has [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Royce D. Applegate]], [[Bea Arthur]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[Hugh Hefner]], [[John Hurt]], [[Phil Leeds]], [[Barry Levinson]], [[Jackie Mason]], [[Paul Mazursky]], [[Andrew Sachs]] and [[Henny Youngman]], among others. [[Orson Welles]] narrates each story.\n\nDespite carrying the title Part I, there were originally no plans for a [[sequel]]. The title is a play on ''The History of the World, Volume 1'' by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], as [[#Previews of coming attractions|detailed below]]. However, 40 years after the film was originally released, [[Hulu]] announced that it ordered a sequel variety series titled ''History of the World, Part II'', with production planned to begin in Spring 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/history-of-the-world-part-ii-series-hulu-mel-brooks-nick-kroll-wanda-sykes-1235091840/|title='History of the World Part II' Variety Series Ordered at Hulu, Mel Brooks to Write and Executive Produce (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Variety|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=October 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film is a [[parody]] of the historical spectacular [[film genre]] [[anthology]], including the [[sword and sandal]] epic and the [[Historical drama film|period costume drama]] subgenres. The four main segments consist of stories set during the Stone Age, the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the [[French Revolution]]. Other intermediate skits include reenactments of the giving of the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Last Supper]].\n\n===The Stone Age===\n[[Cavemen]] (including [[Sid Caesar]]) depict the invention of fire, the first artist (which in turn gives rise to the first [[critic]]), the first marriages ([[Homo sapiens]] and then [[homosexual]]), primitive weapons (particularly spears), and the first funerals. Also depicted are early attempts at comedy and music, by smashing each other's feet with rocks and thus creating an orchestra of screams (until performing [[George Frederick Handel|Handel's]] \"[[Hallelujah Chorus]]\" at the end).\n\n===The Old Testament===\nMoses ([[Mel Brooks]]) comes down from [[Mount Sinai]] carrying three stone tablets, having received the Law from God (the voice of an uncredited [[Carl Reiner]]). When announcing the giving of the reception of the law to the people, Moses proclaims, \"The Lord Jehovah has given unto you these fifteen...\" (whereupon he drops one of the tablets, which promptly shatters) \"[[Oy vey|Oy]]... ten! ''[[Ten Commandments|TEN Commandments]]''! For all to obey!\"\n\n===The Roman Empire===\nBrooks plays Comicus, a \"stand-up philosopher,\" whose job combines elements of philosophy and stand-up comedy. Comicus is notified by his agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Swiftus]] ([[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]) that he has landed a gig at Caesar's palace. In route to the palace Comicus meets and falls in love with a [[Vestal Virgin]] named Miriam ([[Mary-Margaret Humes]]) and befriends an [[Ethiopia]]n slave named Josephus ([[Gregory Hines]]). Josephus' life is spared when he is [[conscription|conscripted]] into the service of the Empress Nympho ([[Madeline Kahn]]).\n\nAt the Palace, Emperor [[Nero]] ([[Dom DeLuise]]) gorges on food, ogles pretty maidens and waits to be entertained. Comicus forgets his audience and begins to crack insulting one-liners about the emperor's [[obesity|abundant body contours]] and [[corruption|corrupt ways]]. Josephus absentmindedly pours a jug of wine into Nero's lap and is ordered to fight Comicus to the death in a [[gladiator]]ial manner. They fight their way out of the palace, assisted in their escape by Miriam, Empress Nympho and a horse named Miracle.\n\nAfter Miriam helps Comicus, Josephus and Swiftus briefly find refuge in Empress Nympho's palace, Josephus is \"outed\" among a row of [[eunuch]]s after \"[[Erection|reacting]]\" to a seductive dancer's performance, and the group is chased by Roman soldiers led by Marcus Vindictus ([[Shecky Greene]]). As the soldiers gain on the group's cart (pulled by Miracle), Josephus instructs them to pull over in a field and requests much [[papyrus]]. He takes \"Roman Red\" [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] which is growing alongside the road and rolls it into the papyrus, forming a device he calls Mighty [[Joint (cannabis)|Joint]], sets fire to it and mounts it to the back of their chariot, trailing smoke into the chasing army.\n\nThe resulting smoke confuses and incapacitates the trailing Roman army. The escaping group then sets sail from the port to [[Judea]]. While waiting tables at a restaurant, Comicus blunders into a private room where the [[Last Supper]] is taking place, as Jesus is telling the apostles \"One of you has betrayed me tonight\". The Apostles are in fear. Comicus says \"JUDAS.\" Judas, startled, almost jumps out of his seat as Comicus replies \"Do you want some mulled wine?\", and interrupts [[Jesus]] ([[John Hurt]]) repeatedly (using his name as an expression for dismay or concern, right in front of him). Eventually, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[Art Metrano]]) arrives to paint the [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|group's portrait]]. Dissatisfied that he can only see the backs of half of their heads, he has them move to one side of the table and paints them with Comicus behind Jesus, holding a silver plate which doubles as a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]].<ref name=\"carlson\">{{cite web |title=Top 8 Mel Brooks Movies of All-Time |url=http://www.filmmisery.com/top-8-mel-brooks-movies-of-all-time/ |first=Alex |last=Carlson  |date=June 1, 2008 |website=FilmMisery.com |access-date=December 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Spanish Inquisition===\nThe [[Spanish Inquisition]] segment parodies a grandiose [[Busby Berkeley]]-style production, consisting of an extended song-and-dance number featuring Brooks as the infamous [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada|Torquemada]]. The sequence opens with a herald introducing Torquemada and making a play on his name; despite pleas for mercy from the condemned, \"you can't Torquemada anything\" (talk him outta anything). Instances of comical [[torture]] include a spinning [[iron maiden]] and \"[[water torture]]\" reimagined with nuns performing an [[Esther Williams]]-style aquatic ballet. [[Jackie Mason]] and [[Ronny Graham]] supply cameos as [[Jewish]] torture victims.\n\n===The French Revolution===\nIn her tavern [[Madame Defarge]] ([[Cloris Leachman]]) incites a mob to plot the [[French Revolution]]. Meanwhile, King Louis of France (Brooks again) is warned by his advisors, Count de Monet (played by [[Harvey Korman]] and mistakenly called \"Count da Money\" by [[Louis XVI|the king]] and others) and his associate [[B\u00e9arnaise sauce|B\u00e9arnaise]] ([[Andreas Voutsinas]]), that the peasants do not think he likes them \u2014 a suspicion reinforced by the king's use of peasants as [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]] in a murderous (and humorous) game of [[Skeet shooting|skeet]]. A beautiful woman, Mademoiselle Rimbaud ([[Pamela Stephenson]]), asks King Louis to free her father, who has been imprisoned in the [[Bastille]] for 10 years because he said \"the poor ain't so bad.\" He agrees to the pardon under the condition that she have sex with him that night, while threatening that should she refuse, her father will die. He gives her ten seconds to decide between \"hump or death\" and at the last second she agrees to \"hump\".\n\nDe Monet manages to convince the king that the revolution is building and he needs to go into hiding, so they will need a stand-in to pretend to be him. Thus Jacques (also Brooks), the ''gar\u00e7on de pisse'' (a.k.a. \"piss-boy,\" whose job is to hold up buckets for the king and his advisors to urinate into), is chosen to impersonate the real king. Later that night, Rimbaud, unaware of the subterfuge, arrives and offers herself to the piss-boy who is dressed as the king. As she invites him to take her [[virginity]], he pardons her father without requiring the sexual favors. After Rimbaud and her [[Senility|senile]] father ([[Spike Milligan]]) return from the prison, the peasants burst into the room and capture the piss-boy \"king\" and Rimbaud. They are taken to the [[guillotine]] for the crimes committed by the crown. When asked if he would like a blindfold or any last words, Jacques declines. However, when they test the guillotine, Jacques make a final request for Novocain. The dialogue recognizes this as an [[anachronism]] when the executioner declares \"there is no such thing known to medical science\", to which Jacques replies \"I'll wait\". Just as Jacques is about to be beheaded, Rimbaud muses that \"only a miracle can save him now\", and Josephus arrives in a cart pulled by Miracle, the horse from the film's Roman Empire segment. They all escape Paris, riding away in the cart. The last shot is of the party approaching a mountain carved with the words \"THE END\".\n\n===Previews of coming attractions===\nThe end of the film presents a mock [[teaser trailer]] for ''History of the World, Part II'', narrated by Brooks, which promises to include [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] on [[Figure skating|Ice]], a [[Viking funeral]], and \"Jews in Space\", a parody of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\nDespite the preview, there were originally no plans for a sequel to be released. The \"Part I\" of the film's title was originally intended to be a historical joke<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the World: Part I (1981) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082517/trivia?tr0962323 |website=[[IMDb.com]] |access-date=August 11, 2010 |quote=DIRECTOR TRADEMARK (Mel Brooks): (sequel): At the end of the movie, a trailer is shown for \"History of the World: Part II\".
