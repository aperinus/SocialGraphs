S. Anderson]]. A direct sequel to ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), it is the second installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]]. The film marks Witt's feature directorial debut; Anderson, the director of the first film, turned down the job due to other commitments, though stayed on as one of its producers. [[Milla Jovovich]] reprises her role as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], and is joined by [[Sienna Guillory]] as [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Oded Fehr]] as [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Olivera]].\n\n''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is set directly after the events of the first film, where Alice escaped from an underground facility overrun by [[zombie]]s. She now bands together with other survivors to escape the zombie outbreak which has spread to the nearby Raccoon City. The film borrows elements from several games in the ''Resident Evil'' series, such as the characters Valentine and Olivera and the villain [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] at locations including [[Toronto City Hall]] and [[Prince Edward Viaduct]].\n\n''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" on [[Metacritic]], and became the lowest-rated film in the ''Resident Evil'' series on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with a rating of 19%. Earning $129 million worldwide on a $45 million budget, it surpassed the box office gross of the original film. It was followed by ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\n\nIn [[Resident Evil (film)|the previous film]], former security operative [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and environmental activist Matt Addison fought to escape an underground genetic research facility called the Hive, the source of a [[zombie]] outbreak. The pair were part of an attempt to expose illegal experiments being performed there by the pharmaceutical company [[Umbrella Corporation]]. The film ended as Alice and Addison were taken into custody by Umbrella and separated.\n\nUmbrella sends a team to the Hive to investigate what happened there; the team is overrun by zombies who quickly spread to the nearby Raccoon City. Umbrella reacts by quarantining the city and evacuating vital personnel from it. Angela Ashford, the daughter of Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, goes missing after her security car is involved in a collision while being extracted from the city. Meanwhile, disgraced Raccoon City Police Department Special Tactics And Rescue Squad ([[List of Resident Evil characters#STARS|STARS]]) operative [[Jill Valentine]] returns to her former precinct to encourage her fellow officers to evacuate Raccoon City. Alice awakens in a deserted hospital and wanders the city in search of supplies, while Umbrella uses the only bridge out of the area to evacuate civilians. At the bridge, Valentine meets with her former partner, Sgt. Payton Wells. A civilian turns into a zombie, biting and infecting Wells. In response to the virus reaching the bridge, Major Timothy Cain, leader of the Umbrella forces in Raccoon City, seals the exit and forces the residents to return to the city.\n\nAfter being abandoned by their employer following a failed attempt to rescue a civilian, Umbrella soldiers [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Olivera]] and Nicholai Ginovaef team up with the surviving STARS operatives to repel zombie attacks. Their position is overrun, and Olivera is bitten and infected. At a separate location, Valentine, Wells, and news reporter, Terri Morales, are about to be overrun, though they are saved by Alice. Umbrella deploys a heavily mutated experimental [[supersoldier]], [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], who kills the remaining STARS members before searching for Alice. Dr. Ashford hacks into the city's [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system and uses it to contact Alice and the other survivors, offering to arrange their evacuation from the city in exchange for help in locating his daughter. He makes an identical offer to Olivera and Ginovaef and explains that Umbrella intends to rid Raccoon City of the zombie infection by destroying it using a nuclear bomb.\n\nOn their way to Angela's location, Alice and the others are ambushed by Nemesis. Valentine kills Wells after he turns into a zombie. Alice engages Nemesis but is wounded and forced to retreat separately, luring Nemesis away from the rest of the group. Valentine and Morales continue, picking up stranded civilian L.J. en route. Valentine meets Olivera, and they find and rescue Angela, although Morales and Ginovaef are both killed. Angela reveals that the zombie outbreak is the result of a virus created by her father to treat the genetic disease from which she suffers: only by regularly injecting herself with the virus is Angela able to survive, though she must also take anti-virus serum to prevent turning into a zombie. Alice uses some of the anti-virus to cure Olivera. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of an extraction point where a helicopter awaits. The group makes it to the rendezvous point, but are ambushed by Umbrella forces. Major Cain kills Dr. Ashford and forces Alice, whom he reveals was augmented by the T-virus, to fight Nemesis. Alice gains the upper hand over the supersoldier, though she ceases fighting after realizing that he is Matt Addison, mutated by Umbrella's experiments.\n\nNemesis turns on Major Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops, but is killed protecting Alice. The rest of the survivors seize the helicopter; they eject Major Cain from it, and he gets killed by the zombies, including a zombified Dr. Ashford. As the survivors escape, the nuclear bomb detonates over the city, and the resulting blast wave causes the helicopter to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela and is impaled on a metal pole. T.V. footage attributes the nuclear attack to a [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] of the city's nuclear power plant, covering up Umbrella's involvement. Alice wakes up in an Umbrella research facility and escapes with help from Olivera, Valentine, L.J., and Angela. As they are escaping, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, a top-ranking Umbrella employee, reveals that Alice's escape is part of Umbrella's plan for her.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Milla Jovovich Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Milla Jovovich]] reprised her role as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] in the film.|alt=A snapshot photograph of Milla Jovovich, a brunette woman in her mid-thirties smiling and looking at the camera]]\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]]\n* [[Sienna Guillory]] as [[Jill Valentine]]\n* [[Oded Fehr]] as [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Olivera]]\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Major Timothy Cain\n* [[Sophie Vavasseur]] as Angela \"Angie\" Ashford\n* [[Razaaq Adoti]] as Sgt.

Describing them both as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] texts, Harper argued that, despite containing some progressive elements including feminist themes that undermine patriarchal power, the films also played into several stereotypes. He said the relationship between Alice and Valentine differs from interactions between male characters in action films as seen by a lack of camaraderie and co-operation between the two and, unlike male characters in ''Apocalypse'', both Valentine and Alice are separately shown being \"protective and nurturing\" of the young Angela; Harper stated even violent action heroines are often portrayed with such characteristics. Harper also criticized how their revealing clothing and camera angles objectified Alice and Valentine throughout the film, and noted that through the [[African Americans|African-American]] character L.J. ''Apocalypse'' showed an \"ironic awareness\" of racist stereotypes, though \"it stops short of challenging them and, indeed, often deploys them\".<ref name=harper/>\n\n[[Douglas Kellner]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California in Los Angeles]] argued the film's ending played \"on fears of out of control nuclear technology and government cover-ups\". A news segment shown in the film, which claimed that reports of corporate wrongdoing were false and that people should instead be thanking the Umbrella Corporation, was \"a barely disguised allegory of lying by corporations and the state during the [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-[[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] era\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Kellner |date=2016 |title=Social apocalypse in contemporary Hollywood film |journal=MATRIZes |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=19|doi=10.11606/issn.1982-8160.v10i1p13-28 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[File:Paul W.
