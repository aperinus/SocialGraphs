The movie received generally positive reviews especially for Ray Liotta's performance who was nominated for an [[MTV Movie Award for Best Villain]] in 1993 for his portrayal of the psychopathic cop.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/ray-liotta-10-best-roles-1358995/ | title=Ray Liotta: 10 Roles That Made Him a Great, Irreplaceable Actor | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=May 26, 2022 }}</ref> The film was remade in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Fareb (1996 film)|Fareb]]'' in 1996.\n\n== Plot ==\nMichael and Karen Carr ([[Kurt Russell]] and [[Madeleine Stowe]]) are a couple living in an upscale part of [[Los Angeles]]. One night, an intruder enters their home through their skylight, upsetting their tranquility. The intruder briefly takes Karen as a hostage with a knife, before dumping her in the swimming pool and escaping. The Carrs call the police, one of whom, Pete Davis ([[Ray Liotta]]), is  quickly intrigued by their politeness, and takes extra interest in the couple's case, cutting through department red tape and quickly installs a security system in the Carrs' house.\n\nIn appreciation for Pete's services, Michael and Karen form a friendship with him and invite him to dinner. When Michael expresses an interest in getting revenge on the intruder, Pete invites him on a [[ride-along]] with his partner, Roy Cole ([[Roger E. Mosley]]). After dropping Cole off, Pete reveals he has  arrested the man who broke into the Carrs' house and offers Michael a chance to take some revenge using Pete's nightstick in retaliation for attacking Karen. Michael declines, insisting that he wasn't serious about personally taking revenge, but Pete responds by becoming insistent and demanding. After the burglar attempts to run away, Pete brutally beats him before Michael demands him to stop.\n\nDeeply suspicious of Pete's mental stability and overprotective behavior, Michael demands Karen to stay away from him, but she refuses to believe him as she believes Micheal is overreacting. When Pete arrives at Micheal's club, Micheal harshly criticizes Pete for his behavior and rejects their friendship coldly, demanding that he stay away from him and Karen. After unsuccessfully attempting to cope by having sex with a random woman whom he sees as \"worthless\", Pete, having been already infatuated with Karen, invites her for coffee to get to know her better and begins to intrude in her marriage with Michael, believing that Micheal is not standing up enough for Karen.\n\nPete, having become jealous, angered, and loathing with hatred over Michael's rejection, begins to harass him by ruining his finances, and breaks in the house after setting the alarm off under the pretense on checking on the couple while having sex. When Michael files a complaint against Pete's unwanted attentions, Pete uses his police connections to destroy Michael's business reputation while encountering bemused apathy from Pete's superiors in the LAPD. Under advice from his lawyer, Michael tries to bribe Pete with $5000 and apologizes for his rejection, but Pete rejects Michael's offer and reveals his obsession with Karen and warns him that he could kill him, causing Michael to scold and warn Karen about Pete's obsession with her, further demanding that she stay away from him.\n\nMichael turns to Cole, who orders his partner to cease his obsessing, see a shrink or face suspension. Pete then remorselessly murders Cole, blaming it on a known criminal. Pete then frames Michael on drug charges by planting a supply of [[cocaine]] in the Carrs' house, enabling him to move in on Karen. Jeopardizing his attorney's finances, Michael resolves to get out on bail and takes matters into his own hands. Back at the Carr house, Karen wakes up to find Pete cooking in place of her friend and colleague, Penny.\n\nAfter Pete declares his love for Karen, Karen discovers Penny's corpse, realizing that Pete brutally murdered her friend. Karen rejects Pete by holding him at gunpoint after pretending to accept him and making love with him to take away his gun. After refusing to leave, Karen attempts to shoot him, only to find out the gun wasn't loaded, as Pete had anticipated. Pete dismisses Karen as worthless and attempts to rape her, but is unsuccessful after finding his police car vandalized, realizing that Michael has returned home. Michael and Karen try to escape, but Pete attacks Michael while Karen hides in the bathroom. Pete and Michael fight, during which Pete accidentally causes the police to start heading over to the house after attempting to answer a phone call while acting as Michael and giving the wrong code, which Michael had changed.\n\nPete holds Michael at gunpoint outside of the bathroom where Karen is, and Pete demands that Karen open the door and escape with him or he'll kill Michael, while Michael begs Karen not to, saying Pete will kill him anyway. Karen ultimately bursts out of the room and uses an ornament to strike Pete in the face, allowing Michael to gain the upper hand, punching Pete and knocking him down the stairs. As Karen and Michael wait for the police to arrive, Pete regains consciousness as Michael holds him at gunpoint. Pete, believing Michael will not shoot him,  tauntingly asks Michael if he'll arrest him as a citizen, just like Michael did when Pete threatened to kill him. To Pete's shock, Michael chooses the opposite and shoots him until the gun is empty, ultimately killing Pete. A relieved Michael and Karen then go outside and watch as the police arrive at the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Michael Carr\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Karen Carr\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Officer Pete Davis\n* [[Roger E.
