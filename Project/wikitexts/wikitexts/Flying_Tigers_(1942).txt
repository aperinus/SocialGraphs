'''''Yank Over Singapore''''' and '''''Yanks Over the Burma Road''''') is a 1942 American [[black-and-white]] [[war film]] drama from [[Republic Pictures]] that was produced by [[Edmund Grainger]], directed by [[David Miller (director)|David Miller]], and stars [[John Wayne]], [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]], and [[Anna Lee]].\n\n''Flying Tigers'' dramatizes the exploits of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG), [[Flying Tigers|Americans who fought the Japanese]] in China, serving with the Chinese Nationalist forces, during [[World War II]]. The movie portrays them as fighting before U.S. entry into the war but, in point of fact, they did not see action until after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is unabashedly a wartime [[propaganda film]] that was well received by a 1940s audience looking for a patriotic \"flagwaver\".<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 59.</ref>{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nJim Gordon leads the [[Flying Tigers]], a squadron of volunteer American pilots who fly [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40C]] fighters against Japanese aircraft in the skies over China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The pilots are a mixed bunch, motivated by money (they receive a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] for each aircraft shot down), or just by the thrill of aerial combat.\n\nOne day, old friend and former airline pilot Woody Jason signs up under Jim's command. An arrogant, hot-shot aviator, he starts causing trouble immediately. When the Japanese raid the Flying Tigers' airbase, the enthusiastic new arrival goes after them, taking up a P-40 fighter without permission, not realizing until too late that it has no ammunition. As a result, Woody is shot down. He is unharmed after his fighter crash lands, but the precious P-40 fighter is a total wreck. As time goes on, Woody shows that he has little use for teamwork, alienating and endangering the other pilots. He abandons his [[wingman]], Blackie Bales, in order to shoot down a Japanese aircraft. As a result, Blackie comes under fire from another and must bail out of his burning P-40. While hanging suspended in his parachute, he is [[Strafing|strafed]] and killed by the Japanese pilot.\n\nWoody starts romancing nurse Brooke Elliott, who is considered by all the Tiger pilots to be Jim's girlfriend. One night, they go on a date. When he is late getting back for a night patrol, Jim's right-hand man, \"Hap\" Davis, secretly takes his place, despite having just been grounded by Jim because his vision had deteriorated, notably at night. In the resulting dogfight, Hap is unable to [[depth perception|judge distances accurately]] and winds up dying in a collision with a Japanese aircraft he is pursuing. This proves to be the final straw; Jim fires Woody, since \"It's out of my hands now. None of these men will ever fly with you again. And they ''have'' to fly.\" The date is Sunday, December 7, 1941, the day of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], bringing America into World War II.\n\nA day later, Jim receives notice that a vital bridge must be destroyed. The target is so heavily defended, however, that the only way there might be a chance of succeeding is to fly in very low with a single unescorted bomber; the mission is likely to be a [[suicide mission]]. Jim volunteers to fly the bomber, but Woody invites himself along at the last second, much to Jim's irritation. They attack the bridge too late to keep a crucial enemy supply train from crossing. Their aircraft is hit by [[flak]] and catches fire. Jim bails out with an unexpected push from Woody, expecting Woody to follow. Woody, however, has concealed the fact that he has been hit by flak. He crashes into the train, destroying it at the cost of his own life.\n\n==Cast==\nAs appearing in ''Flying Tigers'', (main roles and screen credits identified):<ref name=\"credits\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75259/Flying/ \"Credits: Flying Tigers (1941).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies.''

For all ground shots, full-size P-40 [[mockup]]s were used that did no more than taxi. They were propelled by V-8 automobile engines, and the elevators and ailerons were missing from their wings and rear horizontal stabilizers.

This also included the miniature train and bridge sequence in the film's climax, as well as the miniature of the Capelis air transport seen flying through canyons and eventually crashing into the train. ''Flying Tigers''{{'}}s special effects were nominated for an Academy Award, but many people voting did not realize the aircraft were miniatures running on wires, thereby passing the film by for the Oscar.\n\nIn 1942, due to wartime priorities that prohibited the use of U. S. military aircraft for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] productions, [[Republic Studios]] approached [[Curtiss-Wright]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to recreate the aerial battle sequences required for ''Flying Tigers''.<ref>Orriss 1984, p. 60.</ref> A number of P-40F fighter aircraft waiting for delivery to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.

Unlike the film characters, all AVG pilots were recruited from active or reserve U. S. military forces, were in Asia with the approval of the U. S. government, and did not see combat before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The first AVG combat mission was December 20, 1941, nearly two weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack. (AVG commander Chennault, however, had seen combat during his prior Chinese service.)\n\nJohn Wayne's character is nicknamed \"Pappy\", a common nickname for older military commanders. This was also the nickname of [[Gregory Boyington]], a [[United States Marine Corps]] pilot who flew with the AVG until early 1942. Wayne's character, however, was not based on Boyington, who was not commander of the AVG, and not known as \"Pappy\" until he commanded VMF-214 in late 1943.\n\nThe aviation goggles worn by John Wayne on screen and seen on RKO promotional posters were actually a set of repurposed tank crew goggles.\n\nThe footage of [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese soldiers]] firing anti-aircraft guns during the bridge bombing sequence was actually of [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese soldiers]]. They are wearing [[Stahlhelm#M1935|M1935 Stahlhelm]] German army-style helmets, only used by elements of the Chinese Army and not by the Japanese.\n\nThe death of Blackie Bates in ''Flying Tigers'' is based on a real AVG combat incident.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} On January 23, 1942, Flying Tiger [[Bert Christman]]'s fighter was hit in the engine, and he had to bail out. While descending to the ground in his parachute, he was strafed and killed by a Japanese fighter (Christman was hit in several places and probably died as a bullet passed through the back of his neck). The cruel manner of Christman's death was widely publicized in 1942. The [[Associated Press]] published an illustrated feature article about it, and [[Paramount Pictures]] made a short documentary about his life. Later in the year, Christman was featured in [[Series E bond|War bond]] advertisements that read, \"He gave his life. What will you give?\"<ref name=AVG-bio>Glaess, Andy.
