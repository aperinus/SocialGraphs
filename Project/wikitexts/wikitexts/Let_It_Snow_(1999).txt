The film stars Marcus, Alice Dylan, [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Larry Pine]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Judith Malina]], and [[Miriam Shor|Miraim Shor]].

James, however, has commitment issues, and Sarah eventually winds up engaged to Peter (Peter Giles). His grandmother (Judith Malina) had warned him about the [[family curse]], that the \"men always leave and the women go crazy\", which causes James to be reluctant to commit.  Over the next few years, James searches for his true self, ending up at \"The CIA\" \u2013 [[the Culinary Institute of America]].\n\nHis eccentric mother Elise (Bernadette Peters), still upset that her husband left her and James, is on an endless search for her inner self and has commitment issues of her own.
