Crossing a bridge, he dodges a car that seems to be trying to run him down; when he turns around, the car has disappeared. A helicopter flies close to the bridge and a man inside looks at Cameron. Later, Cameron is attracted to a movie shoot \u2014 a [[World War I]] battle scene. Afterwards, he notices a woman who walks through the set greeting the actors, then falls in the water. Cameron dives in to rescue her and is horrified when she pulls off her face \u2014 a mask. She is the movie's leading actress, Nina Franklin, testing make-up for scenes set late in her character's life.\n\nThe director, Eli Cross, the man in the helicopter, descends from the sky on his [[camera crane]]. He offers Cameron a job, explaining that their last stunt man just ran a car off a bridge. They haven't found the body, and Eli can't afford the production delays if police get involved. The police chief is aware of the accident but Eli convinces him that Cameron is the stuntman. Cameron accepts the job.\n\nDenise, the film's hair stylist, dyes Cameron's hair in order to make him resemble the leading man, Raymond Bailey, and harder to recognize. Cameron is convinced Eli is selling him out to the police but Eli reassures him that he is not. Cameron learns from Chuck, the stunt coordinator, and films a scene where he is chased across the roof of a large building and falls through a [[skylight]] into a [[bordello]]. At the same time, Cameron gets involved with Nina, who once had a romance with Eli. Eli is jealous of Cameron.\n\nThe last shoot at the current location involves Cameron's most difficult stunt, driving off a bridge and escaping under water \u2014 the same scene Burt was shooting when he died. Cameron believes Eli is trying to kill him, and will use the stunt to make it look like an accident.\n\nThe morning before the shoot Cameron tells Nina he planned to open an ice cream shop when he got home from Vietnam with a friend, but his friend did not want Cameron around because Cameron's girlfriend had left Cameron for the friend. Enraged, Cameron destroyed the ice cream shop. When a cop showed up Cameron knocked him out, resulting in an attempted murder charge. Nina and Cameron plan to escape together: Nina will hide in the trunk of the car, which Cameron will drive away in the morning instead of driving off the bridge.\n\nChuck has planted an explosive in one of the tires to make the car's tumble look more realistic. Cameron starts the scene too early. The car goes into the water when Chuck triggers the exploding tire, and Cameron scrambles to reach Nina in the trunk, until he looks out the window and sees Nina with Eli on the bridge. Cameron emerges and notices there were divers in the water with him all the time. Nina tells him that she was found in the trunk hours before the shoot, and Eli told her Cameron had decided to do the stunt. Eli explains that he would not let Cameron run off thinking he was trying to kill him. The best way to convince Cameron of Eli's good will, Eli felt, was to make sure Cameron got through the stunt in one piece. Cameron, though furious, is amused and relieved to survive. Cameron and Eli bicker over Cameron's pay and plan to catch a plane to the production's next location.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Eli Cross\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Cameron\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Nina Franklin\n* [[Allen Garfield|Allen Goorwitz]] as Sam\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Jake\n* [[Sharon Farrell]] as Denise\n* [[Adam Roarke]] as Raymond Bailey\n* [[Philip Bruns]] as Ace\n* Charles Bail as Chuck Barton\n* John Garwood as Gabe\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDuring the early 1970s, [[Columbia Pictures]] owned film rights to the novel, with [[Arthur Penn]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] considered for directing it. Columbia offered the film to Richard Rush on the strength of the success of his previous film, ''[[Getting Straight]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNYnYwxE5PE ROAD TO CINEMA - RICHARD RUSH - Director/Screenwriter PART 2.] Jog Road Productions.</ref> Rush initially rejected, then ultimately accepted directing ''The Stunt Man''.\n\nIn July 1971, Columbia announced that Rush would direct the film with [[William Castle]] executive producer.<ref>'Stunt Man' Next for Castle\nMurphy, Mary. Los Angeles Times 3 July 1971: a9.</ref>\n\nRush then penned a 150-page treatment different from the book; in the novel, the characters were all crazy, and in the screenplay, they were instead \"sane in a world gone mad.\"<ref name=\"stm\" /> Columbia executives then rejected the script, saying it was difficult to find a genre to place it in. Said Rush: \"They couldn't figure out if it was a [[comedy film|comedy]], a [[drama (film and television)|drama]], if it was a social [[satire]], if it was an [[action film|action]] [[adventure film|adventure]]...and, of course, the answer was, 'Yes, it's all those things.' But that isn't a satisfactory answer to a studio executive.\" Rush then bought the film rights from Columbia and shopped the film to other studios, to no avail. Funding for the picture finally came from [[Melvin Simon]] who had made a fortune in real estate.<ref name=\"stm\" />\n\nProduction took place in 1978. Opening scenes were filmed at Mary Etta's Cafe, Flinn Springs, California. Many scenes were filmed in and around the historic [[Hotel del Coronado]] in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]], California.\n\nPeter O'Toole mentions in his DVD commentary that he based his character on [[David Lean]] who directed him in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{asof|March 2021}}, the [[comedy-drama film|comedy drama film]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Stunt Man |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stunt_man |website=www.rottentomatoes.com |access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> held a 90% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews.
