The bus breaks down, and the two acquire a car, which soon blows a tire. As Matt changes the tire, Martin comments that they are about the same height, and kicks him into the path of an oncoming truck, killing Matt and the driver. Taking Matt's guitar and clothes, Martin continues on foot, singing in a voice similar to Matt's.\n\nTwenty years later, [[FBI]] [[offender profiling|profiler]] Illeana Scott is summoned by Inspector Leclair to help [[Montreal]] authorities in apprehending a serial killer who assumes his victims\u2019 identities, enabling him to travel undetected across [[North America]]. Illeana interviews [[art dealer]] James Costa, an eyewitness to the killer\u2019s most recent murder. James makes a drawing of the killer and the authorities track down the suspect's apartment, finding a decaying corpse chained in the ceiling. Martin's mother Rebecca claims to have seen her son \u2013 believed dead in Matt\u2019s place years earlier \u2013 alive on a ferry to [[Quebec City]], leading to the body buried as Martin being exhumed for forensic examination, and he becomes the primary suspect. At Rebecca's home, Illeana questions her about her son, learning that Martin was an unwanted child who became unstable after the death of his favored twin brother. Illeana discovers a hidden passageway behind a cabinet leading to Martin\u2019s secret room, where she is attacked by a hidden assailant, who escapes before she can identify him.\n\nIlleana deduces that Asher targets his victims to live as someone different than himself, and that his latest target is James after his apartment is ransacked. James is used in a [[sting operation]] to lure Asher, but the trap fails. During a show at his gallery, James is attacked by an assailant, presumed to be Asher, whom Illeana tries to apprehend but loses in the crowd. The police prepare to move James out of town, but he is confronted by the assailant, who attacks him and kills his police escort before driving away with James at gunpoint. Illeana gives chase, and causes the car to crash and explode just as James manages to escape.\n\nJames visits Illeana\u2019s hotel room where, having grown close over the course of the investigation, they make passionate love surrounded by gruesome crime scene photos. Illeana awakens to find herself covered in James\u2019 blood, but he has merely popped the stitches he received after the car chase.\n\nAs James\u2019 stitches are repaired in the hospital, Illeana is called to the morgue, where Rebecca is unable to identify the charred body of the assailant, and Illeana realizes that Asher must still be alive. Before Illeana can reach her, Rebecca enters the elevator and is confronted by James, revealing himself as the real Martin Asher. He kills his mother, and Illeana is shocked to see him covered in blood before the elevator doors close again, and he escapes the hospital. The police determine that the assailant killed in the car chase was Christopher Hart, a drug addict and art thief to whom Asher owed money. In the struggle in his apartment, Asher killed Hart and staged being taken hostage. Pursued by the police, Asher escapes by train and selects his next victim, taunting Illeana by phone before disappearing. Admitting to having consensual sex with Asher, Illeana is fired from the FBI.\n\nSeven months later, Illeana is living alone in a desolate farmhouse in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]], apparently heavily pregnant with Asher's twins. She is confronted by Asher, who declares that they can start over and live together as a family, but Illeana refuses. Enraged, Asher beats her and prepares to choke her into unconsciousness, seizing a pair of scissors from her when she defends herself and stabbing her in the belly. Illeana stabs Asher in the heart with the same scissors and removes her prosthetic pregnant belly, explaining that the past months were a carefully planned trap. Asher dies, and Illeana informs Leclair the ordeal is over.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as FBI Agent Illeana Scott\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Martin Asher / James Costa\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Christopher Hart \n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Mrs. Rebecca Asher \n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Inspector Joseph Paquette\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Chief Inspector Hugo LeClair\n* [[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as Inspector Emil Duval\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Young Martin Asher\n* [[Justin Chatwin]] as Matt Soulsby\n* {{ill|Andr\u00e9 Lacoste|fr}} as Cashier\n* [[Billy Two Rivers]] as Car Salesman\n* Richard Lemire as Quebec City Cop\n* [[Julien Poulin]] as Quebec City Inspector\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Medical Examiner\n* [[Emmanuel Bilodeau]] as Doctor\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Interrogation Officer\n\n==Story and writing credit==\nThe film is based on the [[Taking Lives (novel)|novel of the same title]] by Michael Pye.
