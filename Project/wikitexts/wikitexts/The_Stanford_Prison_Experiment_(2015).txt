The plot concerns the 1971 [[Stanford prison experiment]], conducted at [[Stanford University]] under the supervision of psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]], in which students played the role of either a prisoner or correctional officer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zimbardo.socialpsychology.org/ |title=Philip G. Zimbardo |author=Philip G. Zimbardo |date=January 17, 2013 |publisher=Social Psychology Network |accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe project was announced in 2002 and remained in development for twelve years, with filming beginning on August 19, 2014, in [[Los Angeles]]. The film was financed and produced by Sandbar Pictures and Abandon Pictures, and premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26, before beginning a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on July 17, 2015. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Stanford University]] psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] conducts a [[Stanford prison experiment|psychological experiment]] to investigate the hypothesis that roles in social situations, rather than individual personality traits, cause participants' behavior. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects eighteen male students<!-- Nine prisoners and six guards; this apparently differs from the real experiment. --> <!-- Actually there are three shifts of three guards in the movie. --> to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself, as they immerse themselves in their assigned roles. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early due to psychological meltdowns. After being chastised and roughly brought back to reality by his girlfriend [[Christina Maslach]], Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Dr. [[Philip Zimbardo]], the lead psychologist of the experiment and plays the role of the prison superintendent \n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Christopher Archer / \"John Wayne\" Guard, a guard in the experiment who becomes the most abusive \n* [[Ezra Miller]] as Daniel Culp / Prisoner 8612, a prisoner in the experiment who eventually quits after a mental breakdown \n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as Peter Mitchell / Prisoner 819, a prisoner in the experiment.
