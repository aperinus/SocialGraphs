It tells the story of a once-famous [[film director]] who suffers [[conversion disorder|hysterical blindness]] due to the intense pressure of directing.\n\n==Plot==\nVal Waxman is a once-prestigious film director who now directs television commercials. When he is thrown off his latest effort (a deodorant commercial filmed in the frozen north of Canada), he desperately seeks a real movie project.\n\nOut of the blue, Val receives an offer to direct a big-budget blockbuster to be set in New York City. However, the offer comes from his former wife, Ellie, and her boyfriend, Hal, the studio head who stole her from Val years ago.\n\nPushed by his agent Al Hack, Val reluctantly agrees to the project, but a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic ailment]] strikes him blind just before production is to begin. With Al's encouragement and aid, Val keeps his blindness a secret from the cast and crew (and Hal). During filming, Val rekindles his relationship with Ellie and reconnects with his estranged son, Tony, while his much younger girlfriend, Lori, leaves him. When Val regains what had been missing his life, he regains his sight as well, and realizes that the movie he directed while blind is a disaster.\n\nSure enough, the movie flops - but is a hit in France, where he is invited to direct a film. After winning Ellie back, he happily proclaims, \"Thank God the French exist.\"\n\n==Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Woody Allen]] - Val Waxman\n*[[T\u00e9a Leoni]] - Ellie\n*[[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] - Ed\n*[[Treat Williams]] - Hal Jaeger\n*[[Debra Messing]] - Lori\n*[[Neal Huff]] - Commercial A.D.\n*[[Mark Rydell]] - Al Hack\n*Lu Yu - Cameraman\n*[[Barney Cheng]] - Translator\n*[[Jodie Markell]] - Andrea Ford\n*[[Isaac Mizrahi]] - Elio Sebastian\n*[[Marian Seldes]] - Alexandra\n*[[Tiffani Thiessen]] - Sharon Bates\n*[[Peter Gerety]] - Psychiatrist\n*[[Greg Mottola]] - Assistant Director\n*[[Fred Melamed]] - Pappas\n*Jeff Mazzola - Prop Man\n*[[Aaron Stanford]] - Actor\n*[[Erica Leerhsen]] - Actress\n*[[Joe Rigano]] - Projectionist\n*[[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] - Tony Waxman\n*[[Rochelle Oliver]] - Script supervisor\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\n\n[[Haskell Wexler]] was the original cinematographer, but was fired by Woody Allen after a week of filming as they couldn't agree on how to film certain shots.

He wrote, \"What's most frustrating is the sense that ''Hollywood Ending'' could have been quite a bit better than it actually is. At 114 minutes, it's decisively lacking in the brevity that used to characterize Allen's pictures&mdash;even the super-serious, [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]]-inspired stuff. Worse, his timing seems to be off&mdash;the filmmaker who was once notorious for cutting his films to the absolute bone now gives us rambling, overlong shots featuring performers who almost seem to be ad libbing their dialogue. I ran to the [[Internet Movie Database]] to investigate, and discovered what may be the problem&mdash;[[Susan E. Morse|Susan Morse]] is gone. Morse, the editor who had worked with Allen since ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' in 1979 and who turned into a real soldier by the time of the jazzy montage that characterized ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'', was reportedly a victim of budget-cutting within the ranks.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Frazer |first=Bryant |title=Hollywood Ending |url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/hollywoo.html |work=Deep Focus  |access-date=2009-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616164000/http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/hollywoo.html |archive-date=2016-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, film critics [[Robbie Collin]] and Tim Robey ranked ''Hollywood Ending'' as the worst movie by Woody Allen.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robbie|last1=Collin|author-link=Robbie Collin|first2=Tim|last2=Robey|title=All 47 Woody Allen movies - ranked from worst to best|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/woody-allens-best-and-worst-movies/|access-date=February 12, 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, England|date=October 12, 2016|archive-date=January 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118143535/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/woody-allens-best-and-worst-movies/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.dreamworks.com/hollywoodending/|Hollywood Ending}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0278823|title=Hollywood Ending}}\n*{{Amg movie|258562|Hollywood Ending}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=hollywood_ending|title=Hollywood Ending}}\n*{{Metacritic film|title=Hollywood Ending}}\n*{{mojo title|id=hollywoodending|title=Hollywood Ending}}\n\n{{Woody Allen}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2000s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films about film directors and producers]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:The Kennedy/Marshall Company films]]\n[[Category:2002 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]"}]}}}}
