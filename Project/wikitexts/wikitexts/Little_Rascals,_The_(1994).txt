The film is an adaptation of [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'', a series of [[short film]]s of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as ''The Little Rascals'') which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children. Directed by  [[Penelope Spheeris]], who co-wrote the screenplay with Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, the film presents several of the ''Our Gang'' characters in an updated setting, featuring re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It is the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were ''[[Liar Liar]]'' and ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]''.\n\nAnother film based on ''[[Our Gang]]'', ''[[The Little Rascals Save the Day]]'', was released as a [[direct-to-video]] feature in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nSpanky is the president of the \"He-Man Woman ('woman' is misspelled as 'womun') Haters Club\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. His best friend, Alfalfa, has been chosen as the driver for the club's prize-winning undefeated go-kart, \"The Blur\", in the annual [[Soap Box Derby]] style race. However, when the announcement is made, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe boys catch Alfalfa in the company of Darla. The club's members try their hardest to break the two apart, eventually causing their beloved clubhouse to burn down. Darla is mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, so she turns her attentions to Waldo, the new rich kid whose father is an oil tycoon. Spanky, Stymie and friends judge Alfalfa's punishment to be left guarding the go-kart day and night until the day of the race. Until that day comes, Alfalfa makes many attempts to woo back Darla including a visit to her ballet rehearsal, an undelivered love letter, and through serenade, all of which fail.\n\nIn order to rebuild their clubhouse, the boys try to fund-raise the cost of lumber, $450. But the youngest ones, Porky and Buckwheat, have unknowingly come up with $500. Their school teacher finds out about the scheme, but Spanky convinces her to use the funds as prize money for the go-kart derby.\n\n\"The Blur\" is stolen by local bullies Butch and Woim. In addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys now need a new set of wheels. They band together to build \"The Blur 2: The Sequel.\" Prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa reconcile and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, to be presented to the victors by the greatest racer of all, \"A.J. Ferguson.\"\n\nButch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo, who (seemingly) kicks out Darla from his race car, pulls a few tricks of his own. It's a wild race to the finish, but \"The Blur 2\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack (and resulting in a photo-finish between \"The Blur\" and \"The Blur 2\" literally \"by a hair\" due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle), despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the derby. When Butch and Woim try to beat up Alfalfa, he knocks Butch into pig slop and Woim throws himself in.\n\nAlong with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla's heart after it turns out that Darla kicked Waldo out of the car, not the other way around. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson -- \"a girl!\" As soon as the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart toward membership and welcome Darla and friends to their club, with \"Women Welcome\" added to the sign.\n\nAt the end of the movie, it is revealed that Uh-Huh can say more than simply \u201cUh-Huh.\u201d The movie closes with bloopers from the kids while filming.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Travis Tedford]] as [[George McFarland|\"Spanky\" McFarland]], the president of \"He-Man Women Hater's Club\" and Alfalfa's best friend\n* [[Bug Hall]] as [[Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer|\"Alfalfa\" Switzer]], Spanky's best friend and Darla's boyfriend\n* Brittany Ashton Holmes as [[Darla Hood|Darla]], Alfalfa's girlfriend\n* Kevin Jamal Woods as [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|\"Stymie\"]], the club's vice-president\n* Jordan Warkol (voice dubbed by [[E.

The surviving cast members saw this as especially hurtful, in light of the fact that director Penelope Spheeris had previously made a point of including [[Buddy Ebsen]], from the original ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'', in her [[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|1993 feature film adaptation]] of that series. Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent ''Our Gang'' comedies, tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, \"It's real cold. They have no respect for the old-timers. At least they could have recognized some of the living legends surviving from the first films.\"<ref>Spiller, Nancy (August 6, 1994).

These include:\n* The scene in which Buckwheat and Porky are fishing and get their fishing lines tangled originates from a scene in the 1943 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Three Smart Guys]]'' with [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]], [[Billy Laughlin|Froggy]], and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Mickey]].\n* The He-Man Woman Haters Club originally appeared in the 1937 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Hearts are Thumps]]''; the club would return in the short ''[[Mail and Female]]'' the same year. The plots for both shorts were reused for the film. In addition, the scene where the gang ruins Alfalfa and Darla's lunch date, as well as the scene where bubbles come out of Alfalfa's mouth while he sings, were borrowed gags from ''Hearts are Thumps''. Alfalfa sending Buckwheat and Porky to deliver a love note to Darla was borrowed from ''Mail and Female''.\n* The \"hi-sign\" originally appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short ''[[Anniversary Trouble]]'', and the animated 1979 special ''[[The Little Rascals Christmas Special]]''.\n* Alfalfa faking a toothache comes from the Academy Award-winning Our Gang short ''[[Bored of Education]]'' (1936).\n* The children dressing up as fire fighters and attempting to put out a fire appeared in the ''Our Gang'' shorts ''[[Fire Fighters]]'' (1922), ''[[The Fourth Alarm]]'' (1926), and ''[[Hook and Ladder (1932 film)|Hook and Ladder]]'' (1932). The gag in which Spanky (Travis Tedford) winds up on a flying water hose was originally used with [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] in ''The Fourth Alarm''.\n* The gag involving Spanky and Stymie disguising as adults appeared in a handful of ''Our Gang'' shorts. [[Mickey Daniels]] and [[Johnny Downs]] attempted to dress up as Santa Claus with this gag in the 1926 short ''[[Good Cheer]]''. [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] and Pleurisy tried this routine in the 1929 short ''[[Election Day (1929 film)|Election Day]]''. [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|Stymie]] and [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] tried it in the 1933 short ''[[Fish Hooky]]'', while [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] tried pulling it off in both the 1935 short ''[[Teacher's Beau]]'' and the 1936 short ''[[Two Too Young]]''.\n* The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa accidentally find themselves performing in a ballet recital was inspired by the plot of the 1937 short ''[[Rushin' Ballet]]''. The costumes that the duo wear are exact replicas of the costumes that the original [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] wore in ''Rushin' Ballet''. The gag in which Alfalfa gets a frog loose in his clothes was originally used in the 1937 short ''[[Framing Youth]]'', where Spanky was trying to convince him he had a frog in his throat.\n* Alfalfa singing \"The Barber of Seville\" originated in ''[[Our Gang Follies of 1938]]''.\n* The idea of the children building their own vehicle out of junk and scrap metal had been used in several ''Our Gang'' shorts, most notably the 1934 short ''[[Hi'-Neighbor!]]''. The gag in which the kids' car causes several adults to leap into the air was also borrowed from ''Hi'-Neighbor!'', and also appears in ''[[One Wild Ride]]'' (1925), ''[[Free Wheeling]]'' (1932), and ''[[Divot Diggers]]'' (1936).\n* Much of the Go-Cart race climax (including the gag in which the car belonging to Butch and Woim accidentally goes into reverse) was borrowed from the 1939 short ''[[Auto Antics]]''. Material from ''Hi'-Neighbor'' and ''[[Three Men in a Tub]]'' (1938) is also present.\n\n==Home media==\n''The Little Rascals'' was released on VHS and DVD in 1995 and 2004 respectively.
