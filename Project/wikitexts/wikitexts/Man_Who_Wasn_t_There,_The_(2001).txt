It stars [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Michael Badalucco]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Jon Polito]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], and [[James Gandolfini]]. The plot is set in 1949 and tells the story of Ed Crane, a withdrawn barber who leads an ordinary life in a small California town with his wife, who he suspects is having an affair with her boss. Crane's situation changes when a stranger comes to the barbershop and offers him the opportunity to join him as a partner in a promising new business, in exchange for an investment of ten thousand dollars. Drawn to the idea, Crane plans to blackmail his wife's lover for the money.\n\nThe film is in [[black-and-white]] and contains voiceover narration, reflecting elements of classic [[film noir]]. At the same time, it differs from it by including classical music, setting the plot in a small town, and having a protagonist outside the criminal underworld. The Coens began developing the idea from a 1940s haircut poster they saw while filming ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]''. The plot was heavily influenced by [[James M. Cain]]'s crime novels, primarily ''[[Double Indemnity (novel)|Double Indemnity]]'', ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and ''[[Mildred Pierce]]''. Aesthetically, ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' was inspired by films from the 1940s and 1950s\u2014including ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''\u2014and even science fiction films and documentaries of those decades.\n\nFilming took place on location in California and was originally shot in color, later converted to black and white. The film premiered and participated in the official selection at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], where Joel Coen won the award for  [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|best director]]. Upon its theatrical release, it was lukewarm at the box office. However, it was well-received by film critics, who praised Roger Deakins' cinematography and the performances, especially the titular character played by Thornton. Some media critics such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', the [[BBC]], and ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' referred to it as one of the best films of the year. In the same way, the [[National Board of Review]] included it among its [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|top ten films of the year]] and gave Thornton the award for [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor|best actor]]. Deakins received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] and the film achieved multiple nominations and awards from other organizations.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1949, Ed Crane is a low-key barber in the town of [[Santa Rosa, California]]. He is married to Doris, a [[bookkeeper]] with a drinking problem, and works in a barbershop that is owned by his brother-in-law, Frank. A customer named Creighton Tolliver tells Ed that he is a businessman looking for investors to put up $10,000 in a new technology called [[dry cleaning]]. Ed decides to collect money by anonymously [[blackmail]]ing Doris's boss, \"Big Dave\" Brewster, who he suspects is having an affair with her. Brewster [[embezzlement|embezzles]] money from his department store to pay the blackmail. However, Brewster soon pieces together the scheme and beats Tolliver to death after he implicates Ed. Brewster confronts Ed at the store and attempts to kill him, but Ed fatally stabs Brewster with a cigar knife in [[self-defense]].\n\nAfter irregularities in the store's books are found, the police arrest Doris on the assumption that she embezzled the money and murdered Brewster. Ed is persuaded to hire Freddy Riedenschneider, a defense attorney from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], who arrives and takes up residence in the most expensive hotel in town. He proceeds to live lavishly on Doris's defense fund, which Frank obtained by mortgaging the barbershop. It is all for nothing because on the morning of the trial Doris hangs herself in her cell. It is later revealed that she was pregnant when she hanged herself but had not had sex with Ed for many years. Riedenschneider leaves town while Frank, now deeply in debt, starts drinking heavily. Ed regularly visits Rachel \"Birdy\" Abundas, a friend's teenage daughter, to hear her play the piano. Tormented by loneliness, he imagines helping her start a musical career and becoming her manager. The fantasy is crushed when a music teacher tells him that Abundas has no talent. On the way back from visiting the teacher, Abundas makes a pass at Ed and attempts to perform [[oral sex]] on him, causing Ed to lose control of the car and crash.\n\nEd wakes up in a hospital bed and two police officers arrest him for murder. Tolliver's beaten body has been found with Ed's investment contract. The police speculate that Ed coerced Doris into embezzling the investment money, and killed Tolliver when he found out. Ed mortgages his house and hires Riedenschneider for his defense. During Riedenschneider's opening statement, Frank attacks Ed, and a [[mistrial]] is declared. With no means left for his defense, Ed throws himself at the mercy of the court. The tactic fails, and the judge sentences him to [[Capital punishment in the United States|death]]. While waiting on death row, Ed writes his story to sell to a [[pulp magazine]]. Shortly before his execution, Ed sees a [[UFO]] outside the jailhouse. As Ed is electrocuted, he reflects on his fate, regretting none of his decisions and hoping to see Doris in the afterlife, both of them free of the mortal world's imperfections.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image|perrow=3|total_width=300\n| image1 = Billy Bob Thornton 2017 (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Frances McDormand 2015 (cropped 2).jpg\n| footer = [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Frances McDormand]] star as married couple Ed and Doris Crane.\n}}\n\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Ed Crane\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Doris Crane\n* [[Michael Badalucco]] as Frank Raffo\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Walter Abundas\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Rachel \"Birdy\" Abundas\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Creighton Tolliver\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Freddy Riedenschneider\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Big Dave Brewster\n* Katherine Borowitz as Ann Nirdlinger Brewster\n* Christopher Kriesa as Officer Persky\n* [[Brian Haley]] as Officer Krebs\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as P.I.

So we started thinking about the guy who actually did the haircuts, and the story began to take shape. It really evolved from that haircut poster.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/11/man-n13.html|title=The Barber of Santa Rosa|date=November 13, 2001|first=David|last=Walsh|website=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref> The directors took the title of the film from the 1899 poem written by [[William Hughes Mearns]] entitled \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" and they chose it in reference to the character of the barber, to reflect his emotional emptiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwlies.com/articles/the-man-who-wasnt-there-underrated-coen-brothers-movie/|title=Is this the Coen brothers' most underrated movie?|date=February 18, 2017|first=Dan|last=Einav|website=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]]|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q5h91ZZemK0C|access-date=January 17, 2022|title=The Coen Brothers: Interviews|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|first=William Rodney|last=Allen|author-link=William Rodney Allen|year=2006|page=152|isbn=9781578068890 }}</ref>\n\n{{Poem quote|\nYesterday, upon the stair,\nI met a man who wasn't there!\nHe wasn't there again today,\nI wish, I wish he'd go away!\nYesterday, going up the stairs,\nI saw a man who wasn't there!\nI didn't see him again today either, I\nwant to see him disappear!\n|source=First lines of the poem \"Antigonish\" (1899) by William Hughes Mearns}}\n\nSet in 1949, the plot\u2014according to Joel Coen\u2014\"is heavily influenced\" by the work of writer [[James M.

The hero sort of stumbles into it,\" Ethan Coen explained. This storytelling device was an homage to the literary work of Cain, whose stories would usually use common characters with conventional jobs who, motivated by need or greed, ended up involved in a crime. Similarly, other conventions popularized by the writer's crime novels were also present in ''The Man Who Wasn't There'', such as the plan to get money quickly, sexual misadventures, and coincidences of fate. The failure of a \"perfect plan\" to raise money appears in ''Double Indemnity'' and ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'', both novels narrated by down-and-out working-class men during the Great Depression in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFs83yglo8YC|access-date=January 17, 2022|title=Coen Brothers \u2013 Virgin Film|publisher=[[Random House]]|first=Eddie|last=Robson|author-link=Eddie Robson|year=2011|page=253|isbn=9780753547700 }}</ref><ref name=\"AdamsJeffrey2015\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GATSBgAAQBAJ|access-date=January 17, 2022|title=The Cinema of the Coen Brothers: Hard-Boiled Entertainments|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Adams|year=2015|isbn=9780231850810 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Cotten in Shadow of a Doubt trailer.jpg|thumb|One of the film's influences was ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), also set in Santa Rosa, California.<ref name=\"AdamsJeffrey2015\" />]]\n\nThe Coens named ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' as a reference to the film and had in mind to some extent the science fiction genre of the 1950s.<ref name=\"AdamsJeffrey2015\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/hitfix/roger-deakins-recalls-the-man-who-wasnt-there-and-film-noir-favorites/|title=Roger Deakins recalls ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' and film noir favorites|date=December 19, 2014|first=Kristopher|last=Tapley|website=[[Uproxx]]|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref> In fact, in terms of aesthetics, the filmmakers said the film was largely influenced by science fiction cinema and \"cheap documentaries of the '50s\".

The plot alludes to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle through the character of defense attorney  Riedenschneider, who refers to the said principle on more than one occasion.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwdC-o-W_KIC|access-date=January 17, 2022|title=The Philosophy of Neo-Noir|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|first=Mark T.|last=Conard|year=2007|isbn=9780813137179 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe Coen brothers began writing the script in the mid-1990s, taking a break in between to film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''. Again available, the brothers moved to Ireland \u2014 where [[Frances McDormand]] was working\u2014to continue writing. Once the script was written, the Coens sent it to producers [[Eric Fellner]] and [[Tim Bevan]] of [[Working Title]]; they intended to start production in 1999 but taking advantage of the availability of [[George Clooney]], they dedicated themselves to another project: ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' After production wrapped, the directors continued with ''The Man Who Wasn't There''. The project was financed independently by Working Title, who raised an approximate budget of $20 million.\n\nThe Coens wrote the characters of Doris \u2014Ed Crane's wife\u2014 and Frank \u2014the owner of the barbershop\u2014 for McDormand and [[Michael Badalucco]], respectively. The directors allowed an actor with whom they had not worked before, [[Billy Bob Thornton]], to star in the title role. He accepted the proposal to play the barber before reading the script: \"I knew that it would be good. There are certain people you know you can't go wrong with.\" For the role of Doris' boss and lover, the Coens convinced [[James Gandolfini]], who according to them was \"perfect for the character\". [[Jon Polito]] and [[Tony Shalhoub]], two other actors already known to the Coens, also joined the cast, followed by [[Adam Alexi-Malle]], Katherine Borowitz, [[Richard Jenkins]], and the teenaged [[Scarlett Johansson]]. Jenkins initially declined the opportunity to star because he had been rejected from three previous productions of the Coens. However, the directors eventually chose him for the role. [[Bill Murray]] was considered for the role that would ultimately be Thornton's.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on June 26, 2000, in California and ended on September 1, after ten weeks of filming. Deakins' cinematography was simple and traditional. Most of the shots were taken with the camera at eye level, with normal lenses and a long depth of field. Compared to older American film noirs, Deakins used a wide range of grays 31 and attempted to create low contrast without many strong shadows, using fewer and larger lights. Despite being set in the past, he used contemporary technologies and wanted ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' to reflect the era in which it was being made: \"we're not trying to make an old movie\", said Deakins. It was filmed in 35&nbsp;mm format in color and converted to black and white during post-production. This procedure was due, in part, to technical reasons since in recent decades the availability of black and white film rolls was very scarce. However, due to contractual and marketing requirements, it was released in color in some countries. \"The film wasn't made to be seen in color\", stated Joel Coen, mentioning that in color it would look \"horribly out of place\" due to grayscale neutralizing colors outside the time frame of the plot.\n\n{{Blockquote|For a lot of intangible reasons that are not easy to explain, black and white seemed to be appropriate for the plot. It's a movie from a historical period and the black and white helps the feel of that time. It's evocative for a story like this in ways color photography isn't.|Joel Coen}}\n\nThe set and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Mary Zophres, respectively, had to adapt to the absence of color, avoiding high contrasts that would distract attention. Black and white also affected the actors, intensifying some elements: \"Just a close-up is very striking because of the shadows and the sense of depth,\" said McDormand. However, the team did not lose sight of the color version and designed the locations avoiding bright colors and preferring browns and grays. Ed Crane's clothing consisted of sports jackets and gabardine and rayon shirts. Typical of those years, her stockings had no elastic at the top, and \u2014 like the extras \u2014 she used garters to hold them up. Women's clothing included seamed stockings, girdles, and pointy bras. Defense attorney Freddy Riedenschneider's peaked lapel double-breasted suit was inspired by Salvador Dal\u00ed, according to costume designer Mary Zophres: \"It's a bit unusual for the time and suggests opulence.\"\n\nTo compose his character's look, Thornton looked at images of figures from that decade and borrowed some elements from Raymond Burr and Frank Sinatra. The actor commented on the matter that \"once you get the right look, everything in your attitude changes\". When Ed appears on screen, he is almost always seen smoking a Chesterfield, a detail of the time. In addition, professional barbers trained Thornton and Badalucco.\n\n====Locations====\n[[File:Homes on Michigan Ave., Bungalow Heaven 03.JPG|thumb|The Bungalow Heaven neighborhood located in the city of Pasadena (California) was used to shoot exterior scenes of Ed Crane's house.]]\n\nFilming began in the abandoned Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles to set a Santa Rosa city jail cell. Later, the team moved to East Los Angeles and then to the Musso & Frank Grill restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard, where Ed Crane meets his attorney for the first time. Filming continued in Thousand Oaks for two days to shoot the country wedding scenes. Before his scenes, Michael Badalucco had to practice on pigs for the scene where he rides one. The production then returned to Los Angeles to film in a Presbyterian church on Wilshire Boulevard and in Downtown Los Angeles, where it was filmed in an apartment complex that was used to make the hotel lobby scenes. An abandoned Bank of America located also in the center was used for the scenes where Ed goes to the bank. The Nirdlingers building, where Doris works as an accountant, was created from an abandoned furniture store located in Glendale, production designer Dennis Gassner recalled:\n\n{{Blockquote|We had to modernize it in a certain way, keeping what was already in the architecture and making it work for the modern style of 1949. That space was like a quarry where I could extract what I needed. In fact, I used some chrome art deco bulwark designs that had been kept on the walls and various wall moldings.}}\n\nA significant portion of the filming took place over a day in the city of Orange, which was used to represent the exteriors of the town of Santa Rosa, where the majority of the film is set. Although only one day was shot in Orange, the team worked for more than two weeks setting the streets according to the year 1949: traffic signs were replaced, facades were modified and minor street repairs were made. The exterior scenes of Ed Crane's house were filmed in the Pasadena neighborhood of Bungalow Heaven, a popular and affordable location in the mid-twentieth century. The Coens chose the house with the lower ceiling to achieve the impression of a smaller space and thus represent the economic situation of the barber. The scenes in the piano teacher's room were also shot in Pasadena, exactly in the Green Hotel building complex. Locations were used to film almost the entire film except for a few scenes, such as the barbershop scenes\u2014the last ones before the end of filming\u2014on a set built by Gassner at Paramount Studios.\n\n===Music===\nThe film's soundtrack consists of classical music, primarily piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven, interspersed with seven new compositions by Carter Burwell. In addition to Beethoven, the soundtrack included a Mozart composition, \"[[Sull'aria ... che soave zeffiretto]]\". The inclusion of classical music is a resource that distinguishes the film from others in the noir genre. Music editor Todd Kasow was tasked with selecting suitable sonatas for the soundtrack while Burwell began work on a \"pianocentric\" composition. Some of the compositions feature \"cyclical\" structures that symbolize the situation the protagonist finds himself in and his difficulty in freeing himself from it, but at the same time, the Coens felt it was essential to the character that the music suggests \"a vague longing\". Journalist Dan Goldwasser described Burwell's work as \"dark and solemn\" and wrote that the main composition, \"The Trial of Ed Crane\", has \"a kind of romanticism with just a hint of hope\". ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' was the ninth film on which Burwell collaborated with the Coen brothers. The Decca Records label released the soundtrack album on October 30, 2001.\n\n==Release==\n===Premiere===\n[[File:COEN Brothers (cannesPH).jpg|thumb|The Coen Brothers at the film's premiere at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Joel Coen shared the festival award for best director with David Lynch.]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 2001. After Cannes, the film reached other European film festivals that year such as Edinburgh, Flanders, Warsaw, and Vienna. The distributor USA Films was in charge of its release in the United States, although its screening was limited to select theaters. On October 31, 2001, it premiered in Los Angeles and New York. It was the first Coen film to be released in black and white, something the directors had tried unsuccessfully with ''[[Blood Simple]]'' (1984) and ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' (1994) in the face of the advantages of color distribution.\n\n===Home media===\nThe first home edition was available on DVD released by USA Home Entertainment in 2002. DVD extras included commentary by the Coen brothers and Thornton, a sixteen-minute making-of, an interview with Deakins, five deleted scenes, a photo gallery, and promotional videos. The Coens and Thornton share behind-the-scenes anecdotes, including the story about the haircut poster that inspired the idea for the film. In an in-depth interview with Deakins, the cinematographer discusses the pros and cons of shooting in black and white, his aesthetic influences, and his experience working with the Coens. Reviewing the DVD, the site DVD Talk wrote that the black-and-white photography \"is brilliantly captured, evoking film-noir history while remaining immaculately clean. The blacks are deep and solid, giving the image an enchanted look.\" In September 2002, a three-disc DVD edition was released in France: the first with the film in black and white, the second with the color version, and the last with the extras, which as a novelty included a documentary of almost fifty minutes entitled \"The Film Noir Universe\". In 2015 Universal Home Video released a regular version on Blu-ray.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Man Who Wasn't There'' grossed $7.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $11.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.9 million against its $20 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> The film was the Coen Brothers' worst-performing film at the box office since ''The Hudsucker Proxy'' (1994). Some authors speculated that the result of this failure was due, in part, to the lack of enthusiasm of the mass public towards black and white film. In its opening weekend in the United States, it grossed $664,404 from thirty-nine theaters.\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Rotten Tomatoes prose|81|7.1|160|Stylish but emotionally distant, ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' is a clever tribute to the film noir genre.|ref=yes|access-date=January 17, 2022}} {{MC film|73|33}}<ref>{{cite Metacritic|type=movie|id=the-man-who-wasnt-there|title=The Man Who Wasn't There|access-date=January 17, 2022}}</ref> Many critics praised the film for both its technique and its performances. [[Richard Schickel]] of [[Time (magazine)|Time]] wrote: \"The ability to show no emotion isn't a highly prized quality in movie leads, but Thornton, that splendid actor, does it perfectly as Ed Crane, a taciturn small-town barber, circa 1949\". Other critics also praised Thornton's leading role, such as [[Emanuel Levy]], who opined that Thornton \"beautifully absolves himself in a challenging role that demands more reaction than action\" and added, \"he comes across as a tormented Montgomery Clift\". Variety magazine wrote that the film's protagonist \"sets new standards of opacity and passivity\".\n\n[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the [[Chicago Reader]] noted that \"Joel and Ethan Coen stay true to their penchant for bumbling, neo-noir heroes, and their firm belief that life normally turns out lavishly horrific.\" [[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] commented, \"The film is effective and confident in its style, so loving and so intense that if you see it often, it will be like a party.\" In the same way, [[Peter Travers]] of [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] magazine named it one of the best films of the year and expressed that it is \"devilishly funny\" and highlighted the photography and performances. Travers included ''The Man Who Wasn't There'' at number eight on his list of the ten best indie films of 2001. [[Peter Bradshaw]] of The Guardian stated, \"It's the best American film of the year\" and [[Philip French]], in another review for [[The Guardian]], also claimed that it was the best film of the year up to that point. Likewise, [[Marc Savlov]] of [[Austin Chronicle]] announced that it was \"the most beautiful film of the year\" and added that \"Billy Bob Thornton's performance represents a dazzling rough diamond\". The BBC Critic [[Nev Pierce]] also described it as \"one of the best films of the year\" and added about its viewing that it was \"a unique, peculiar, captivating experience.\"\n\nDeakins's black-and-white photography was singled out by several critics. The [[Chicago Reader]] compared the photograph to Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd 8 and reviewer Matthew Turner of View London commented that black and white \"hasn't looked this splendid since the 1940s\". Despite writing a lukewarm review, Variety's [[Todd McCarthy]] praised Deakins' work, Dennis Gassner's sets, and Mary Zophres' costumes to create a \"superior representation of the post-war period in a small town\". Concerning the rural setting, the historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caparr\u00f3s pointed out: \"Few times has American cinema appeared in such a subtle and forceful way to testify the deep existential emptiness and the mediocrity of deep America\". The film did not convince [[Michael Sragow]] of The Baltimore Sun, who said: \"''The Man Who Wasn't There'' is an intellectualized, stylized, completely empty period production. Despite its lavish, claustrophobically controlled black-and-white look, it packs the punch of a toy gun.\" Similarly, [[David Denby]] of \u2018\u2019[[The New Yorker]]\u2019\u2019 called it a \u201cdud academic exercise\u201d.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/25/killing-joke-denby | title=The Coen Brothers' Twists and Turns | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] | date=February 18, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{{Expand section|small=no|date=January 2022}}\n\nAfter its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Joel Coen took home Best Director No. 3 and shared the award with David Lynch for Mulholland Drive. The film was also nominated for the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest honor, but Nanni Moretti's Son's Room won the prize. The film was part of the selection of the ten best of the year by the National Board of Review.<ref>{{Cite web |last=King |first=Susan |date=December 6, 2001 |title=''Moulin Rouge'' Named Best Film |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-06-wk-susan6-story.html |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/LkDrH |archive-date=January 17, 2022 |access-date=January 17, 2022 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for a statuette at the 74th Academy Awards in the category of Best Cinematography (Deakins), although the award ultimately went to Andrew Lesnie for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Also, the film received three nominations for the Golden Globe Awards in the categories of best dramatic film, best screenplay, and best dramatic actor (Thornton), but failed to win any.\n\nDeakins won the Best Cinematography award at the BAFTA Awards.
