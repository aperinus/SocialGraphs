Produced by [[New Line Cinema]], it is an adaptation of [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Journey to the Center of the Earth|1864 novel]] (which had previously been adapted multiple times, most notably in the 1959 film [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|of the same name]]), and was released in [[3D film|3D]] theaters by [[Warner Bros.

Trevor learns at work that his brother's lab is being shut down because of a lack of funding. Trevor has forgotten that Sean is coming until he receives several messages from Sean's mother. When Sean's mother drops him off, she leaves Trevor with a box of items that belonged to Max, Trevor's brother and Sean's father, who disappeared 10 years before, in July 1997. Sean suddenly takes interest in what Trevor has to say after he tells him about his father, whom he never really had a chance to know.  In the box, Trevor discovers the novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' by Jules Verne. Inside the book Trevor finds notes written by his late brother. Trevor goes to his laboratory to find out more about the notes. There he realizes that he must go to [[Iceland]] to investigate for himself.\n\nHe intends to send Sean back to his mother, but relents at Sean's protest and brings Sean to Iceland with him.  They start by looking for another volcanologist. When they get to that scientist's institution, they meet his daughter Hannah, who informs them he is dead. She also tells them that both her father and Max believed that [[Jules Verne]]'s books were factual accounts. However she offers to help them climb up to the instrument that has suddenly started sending data again. While hiking the mountain a [[lightning storm]] forces the three into a cave. The cave entrance collapses, trapping them, so they have no alternative but to go deeper in the cave, which turns out to be an abandoned mine.\n\nTrevor, Sean, and Hannah investigate farther into the mine until they fall into a deep hole, taking them to the \"[[hollow earth|Center of the Earth]]\". They all continue until they discover a cave-dwelling that Max lived in.  Trevor and Sean find Max's old journal. Hannah and Trevor discover Max's dead body and bury him. Trevor reads a message from Max's journal that was written on Sean's 3rd birthday (8.14.97). Trevor continues to read Max's journal until he realizes from his notes that Max died because of dehydration and they must quickly leave, as the temperature is steadily rising.\n\nTrevor figures that they must find a [[geyser]] that can send them to the surface, which they can find in a lava tube on the other side of the world. They must do this in 48 hours or all of the water to create the geyser will be gone. They also figure that they must get out before the temperature rises past 135 degrees. They begin by crossing the underground ocean, and then the two adults become separated from Sean. Sean's guide is now a little bird who has been present since the trio entered the center, and it takes him towards the river. However, he encounters a ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', and Trevor \u2013 who desperately is searching for him \u2013 saves him. When they arrive at the geyser it is all dried up, having already taken place, and, to make things worse, molten hot [[magma]] is rising below them in a lava tube, endangering their lives. Trevor quickly discovers that there is a new water chamber behind a wall of magnesium.\n\nTrevor uses a flare to ignite the magnesium in the wall and causes a geyser to shoot them through [[Mount Vesuvius]] in [[Italy]]. When they destroy the home of an [[Italian people|Italian]] man, Sean gives him a diamond that he had found earlier. Trevor sees that he has many more in his backpack, and he uses them to fund his brother's laboratory. Throughout the adventure, Hannah and Trevor gradually become so attached to each other that they kiss. On the final day of Sean's visit with Trevor (and now Hannah), he is leaving their new home, which was purchased with some of the diamonds Sean took from the cave, and Trevor hands Sean a book titled \"Atlantis\", suggesting they could maybe hang out at Sean's during Christmas break.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Professor Trevor \"Trev\" Anderson, a volcanologist, Sean's uncle and Max's brother\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Sean Anderson, Trevor's nephew and Liz & Max's son\n* [[Anita Briem]] as Hannah Asgeirsson\n* [[Seth Meyers]] as Professor Alan Kitzens\n* Jean-Michel Pare as Maxwell 'Max' Anderson, Sean's father, Trevor's brother and Liz's husband\n* Jane Wheeler as Elizabeth 'Liz' Anderson, Sean's mother and Max's wife.\n* Frank Fontaine as Old Man\n* [[Giancarlo Caltabiano]] as Leonard\n* [[Kaniehtiio Horn]] as Gum-Chewing Girl\n* Garth Gilker as Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and filming===\nIn September 2001, [[Walden Media]] announced that [[Eric Brevig]] was hired and set to direct ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'' based on the book of the same name by [[Jules Verne]].
