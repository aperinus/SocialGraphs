Their compound holds 630 [[Sergeant]]s representing many different [[Aircrew|air crew]] positions, but the film focuses on one particular barrack, where the men come to suspect that one of their number is an informant. The film was directed and produced by [[Billy Wilder]] who, with [[Edwin Blum]], adapted the screenplay from the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] play of the same name.  The play was written by  [[Donald Bevan]] and [[Edmund Trzcinski]], based on their experiences as prisoners in [[Stalag]] 17B in [[Austria]].\n\nThe film stars [[William Holden]] in an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning performance, along with [[Don Taylor (American filmmaker)|Don Taylor]], [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]], [[Harvey Lembeck]], [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Neville Brand]], [[Richard Erdman]], [[Michael Moore (actor)|Michael Moore]], [[Sig Ruman]], and [[Otto Preminger]]. Strauss and Lembeck appeared in the original Broadway production.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn a German [[Stalag|prisoner-of-war camp]] named ''Stalag 17'', one of its compounds holds 630 American [[Aircrew|airmen]] (all of whom are [[sergeant]]s), and is overseen by camp warden [[Oberst]] von Scherbach.\n\nIn December 1944, the men of Barracks 4\u2014led by appointed barracks chief \"Hoffy\" Hoffman and security officer Frank Price\u2014arrange for the escape of fellow airmen Manfredi and Johnson. The pair are shot dead in the attempt, and the men believe they were betrayed by an [[informant]]. Suspicion falls on J.J. Sefton, an enterprising cynic who barters openly with the German guards for various luxuries. He also creates profitable ventures that distract from the mundanity of camp life: from organizing rat races for gambling, to an improvised [[distillery]] for brewing alcohol, to a makeshift telescope to spy on the Russian women from a neighboring compound. Clarence \"Cookie\" Cook, who narrates the story, serves as Sefton's underling.\n\nThe men of Barracks 4 do their best to keep sane, which includes enduring the antics of barracks clowns \"Animal\" Kuzawa and Harry Shapiro, and smuggling in a radio to listen in on war news. Their jovial supervisor, [[Feldwebel]] Schulz, secretly retrieves hidden messages from a hollow black queen on the [[chess]]board, and straightens the looped cord of a dangling light bulb, which serves as a signal between himself and the informant. Just before Christmas, a recently captured Lieutenant Dunbar is assigned to Barracks 4 until he can be sent to an officers camp. Sgt. Bagradian, who accompanies Dunbar, reveals that Dunbar rigged a time bomb in transit and blew up a munitions train. Sefton recognizes Dunbar from officers school, and believes that he only passed because of his rich family, creating tension between them.\n\nSchulz announces that an inspector from the [[Geneva Convention]] will arrive, and Sefton bribes the guards to let him spend the day with the Russian women. The radio is later confiscated by Schulz. Concluding that Sefton was rewarded for revealing the radio, the men confront him when he returns, but Sefton denies he was responsible. Von Scherbach interrupts to arrest Dunbar as a saboteur; the men blame Sefton again and brutally beat him.\n\nThe next day, the inspector from Geneva arrives with [[Red Cross parcel]]s\u2014including 2,000 [[Table tennis|ping-pong balls]], which the prisoners use to create [[smoke bomb]]s. The inspector is then told about Dunbar, and he warns von Scherbach that Dunbar can not be convicted without proof, lest there be [[war crime]] trials. Von Scherbach hands Schulz a black queen to be delivered to the informant. During the [[Christmas Eve]] celebrations, Price stealthily switches out the black queen, reads the hidden message, and then resets the signal. Sefton, recovering from his beating, notices the signal afterwards and becomes suspicious. Price gets Bagradian to reveal the recipe of Dunbar's time bomb: a lit cigarette tucked into a matchbook. That night, an air raid siren forces the men to evacuate. Sefton hides and witnesses Price speaking German to Schulz, and demonstrating the time bomb as evidence against Dunbar.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] arrive to take Dunbar to [[Berlin]]. While Hoffy has Price guard Sefton (who is still believed to be the informant), he gathers the men to rescue Dunbar. A riot and an ignited smoke bomb distract the guards, and Dunbar is taken to hide in a [[latrine]]'s [[water tower]] until nightfall. After von Scherbach threatens to raze the camp, the men of Barracks 4 decide that one of them must help Dunbar escape. Price volunteers, and Sefton finally accuses him of being a German spy. Sefton interrogates Price and reveals the messaging system he used; the men are convinced and Price tries to flee, but he is quickly restrained.\n\nAnticipating a generous reward, Sefton decides to rescue Dunbar. He retrieves the Lieutenant, and the prisoners throw Price out of the barracks with cans tied to his leg. Price attracts the spotlights of every guard tower and is gunned down; Sefton and Dunbar escape amidst the chaos. The prisoners return to their bunks, and Cookie whistles \"[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Holden]] as J.J.

Trzcinski appears in the film as a prisoner.\n\nThe play was directed by [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] and was the Broadway debut of [[John Ericson]], as Sefton. It was presented first at the Edwin Burke Memorial Theater of [[The Lambs]], a theatrical club, on March 11, 1951 (staged by the authors). It began its Broadway run in May 1951 and continued for 472 performances. The Sefton character was loosely based on Joe Palazzo, a flier in Trzcinski's prisoner-of-war barracks. The script was rewritten extensively by Wilder and Blum.\n\n===Casting===\nBoth [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] were considered for the role of Sefton.<ref name=\"Capua2009\">{{cite book|last=Capua|first=Michelangelo|title=William Holden: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMp6ACb74UkC&pg=PA65|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5550-8|page=65}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\nThe prison camp set was built on the John Show Ranch in [[Woodland Hills, California|Woodland Hills]], on the southwestern edge of the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref name=\"Rowan\">{{cite book|last=Rowan|first=Terry|title=World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdvGBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA443|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-105-58602-6|page=443}}</ref> The shoot began in February 1952, during the rainy season in California, providing plenty of mud for the camp compound.<ref name=\"Phillips2010\">{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&pg=PT163|date=February 5, 2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-7367-2|page=163}}</ref> It is now the location of a [[meetinghouse]] of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].\n\n===Filming and release===\nThe film was shot in chronological order, an unusual practice because that method is usually much more expensive and time-consuming. In a [[featurette]] released later, members of the cast said that they themselves did not know the identity of the informant until the last three days of shooting.\n\nPeter Graves recalled that the film was held back from release for over a year because Paramount Pictures did not  believe that anyone would be interested in seeing a film about prisoners of war. The 1953 release of American POWs from the [[Korean War]] led Paramount to release it on an [[exploitation film|exploitation]] angle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Weaver |first=Tom |chapter=Peter Graves Interview |title=Earth Vs. the Sci-fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews |publisher=McFarland & Company |page=146 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-786-42210-4}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nBy January 1954, ''Stalag 17'' had earned $3.3 million in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/details/variety193-1954-01/page/n301/mode/2up |title=Top Grossers of 1953 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=10 |date=January 13, 1954 |access-date=July 16, 2021 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] praised the film, calling it \"cracker jack movie entertainment\".

His acceptance speech is one of the shortest on record (\"thank you, thank you\"); the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time which forced Holden's quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Montgomery Clift]] should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' instead of him. It is said that he felt he was given the award as consolation for not having previously won it for ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
