The film was produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]] and Dieter Giessler. It stars [[Noah Hathaway]], [[Barret Oliver]], [[Tami Stronach]], [[Patricia Hayes]], [[Sydney Bromley]], [[Gerald McRaney]] and [[Moses Gunn]], with [[Alan Oppenheimer]] providing the voices of both [[Falkor]] and [[Gmork]] ([[List of The Neverending Story characters|as well as other characters]]). The film follows a boy who happens upon a magical book that tells of a young warrior who is given the task of stopping the Nothing, a dark force, from engulfing the wonderland world of Fantasia.\n\nAt the time of its release, it was the most expensive film produced outside the [[United States]] or the [[Soviet Union]]. The film was the first in [[The NeverEnding Story (film series)|''The NeverEnding Story'' film series]].<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite magazine  | url=https://variety.com/1983/film/reviews/the-neverending-story-1200425911/ | title=The Neverending Story Review | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=December 31, 1983}}</ref> The film adapts only the first half of the book, and consequently does not convey the message of the title as it was portrayed in the novel. The second half of the book was subsequently used as a rough basis for the second film, ''[[The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter]]'' (1990). The third film, ''[[The NeverEnding Story III|The NeverEnding Story III: Escape from Fantasia]]'' (1994), has an original plot not based on the book.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- A plot summary is usually 400 to 700 words per WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nTen-year-old [[Bastian Bux]] is a shy and outcast bibliophile and lives with his widowed father. One day on his way to school, Bastian is chased by bullies but escapes by hiding in a bookstore, annoying the bookseller, [[Carl Conrad Coreander|Mr.&nbsp;Coreander]]. Bastian's interest in books leads him to ask about the one Coreander is reading, but the bookseller advises against reading it, saying that it is not a \"safe\" story like regular books. With his curiosity piqued, Bastian secretly takes the book, titled ''The Neverending Story'', leaving a note promising to return it, and hides in the school's attic to read.\n\nThe book describes the [[fantasy world]] of Fantasia slowly being devoured by a malevolent force called \"The Nothing\". The [[Childlike Empress]], who rules Fantasia, has fallen ill, and the young warrior [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]] is tasked to discover a cure, believing that once the Empress is well, the Nothing will no longer be a threat. Atreyu is given a medallion called the [[AURYN|Auryn]] that can guide and protect him in the quest. As Atreyu sets out, the Nothing summons a vicious and highly intelligent [[wolf]]-like creature named [[Gmork]] to kill Atreyu.\n\nAtreyu's quest directs him to the giant, [[turtle]]-like adviser Morla the Ancient One in the Swamps of Sadness. Though the Auryn protects Atreyu, his beloved horse Artax is lost to the swamp, and he continues alone. Morla, who is allergic to youth, doesn't have the answers that Atreyu seeks, but reluctantly directs him to the Southern Oracle, ten thousand miles distant. Gmork closes in as Atreyu succumbs to exhaustion trying to escape the Swamps, but is narrowly saved by the luck [[dragon]] [[Falkor]]. Falkor takes him to the home of two [[gnome]]s who live near the gates to the Southern Oracle. Atreyu crosses the first gate, but is perplexed when the second gate\u2014a mirror that shows the viewer's true self\u2014reveals a boy which Bastian recognizes as himself. Atreyu eventually meets the Southern Oracle, who tells him that the only way to save the Empress is to find a human child who lives beyond the boundaries of Fantasia to give her a new name. Atreyu and Falkor flee, as the Nothing consumes the Southern Oracle.\n\nIn flight, Atreyu is knocked from Falkor's back into the Sea of Possibilities, losing the Auryn in the process. He wakes on the shore of some abandoned ruins, where he finds several murals depicting his adventure, including one of Gmork. Gmork then reveals himself and explains that Fantasia represents humanity's imagination and is thus without boundaries, while the Nothing is a manifestation of the loss of [[hope]]s and dreams. Atreyu battles and kills Gmork, as the Nothing begins to consume the ruins.\n\nFalkor manages to retrieve the Auryn and rescue Atreyu. The two find themselves in a void with only small fragments of Fantasia remaining, fearing that they have failed, until they spot the Empress' Ivory Tower among the fragments. Inside, Atreyu apologizes for failing the Empress, but she assures him that he has succeeded in bringing to her a human child who has been following his quest{{snd}} Bastian. She further explains that, just as Bastian is following Atreyu's story, [[Metafiction|\"others\" are following Bastian's]], making this part of the Neverending Story. As the Nothing begins to consume the Tower, the Empress explains that Bastian must call out her new name to save Fantasia. Disbelieving he has been incorporated with the story, he denies these events actually happened. He gives in after she pleads directly to him to call out her new name, running to the window of the attic to call out \"Moon Child\".\n\nBastian awakens with the Empress, who presents him with a grain of sand{{snd}} the sole remnant of Fantasia. The Empress tells Bastian that he has the power to bring Fantasia back with his imagination. Bastian re-creates Fantasia and flies on Falkor's back to see the land and its inhabitants restored, including Atreyu and Artax. When Falkor asks what his next wish will be, Bastian brings Falkor to the real world to chase down the school bullies. The film narrates that Bastian had many more wishes and adventures, \"But that's another story\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Neverending Story characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Barret Oliver]] as [[Bastian Balthazar Bux]].\n* [[Noah Hathaway]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]].\n* [[Tami Stronach]] as [[The Childlike Empress]], to whom Bastian gives the new name \"Moon Child\".\n* [[Patricia Hayes]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Engywook and Urgl|Urgl]], Engywook's wife and a healer.\n* [[Sydney Bromley]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Engywook and Urgl|Engywook]], Urgl's husband and a scientist.\n* [[Gerald McRaney]] as Barney Bux, Bastian's widowed, workaholic father.\n* [[Moses Gunn]] as Cairon, a servant of the Empress.\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as the voices of [[Falkor]], [[Gmork]], Rockbiter, and the Narrator (the latter three are uncredited).\n* [[Thomas Hill (actor)|Thomas Hill]] as [[Carl Conrad Coreander]], a grumpy bookseller.\n* [[Deep Roy]] as Teeny Weeny, a messenger riding on a racing snail.\n* [[Tilo Pr\u00fcckner]] as Night Hob, a messenger riding a narcoleptic hang-glider bat.\n* Darryl Cooksey, Drum Garrett, and Nicholas Gilbert as Ethan, Todd, and Lucas, three bullies who torment Bastian.\n* [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] as the voice of [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Morla|Morla]] (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nAuthor Michael Ende was initially happy about his book being turned into a film.

The [[The NeverEnding Story (song)|theme song of the English version]] of the film was composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]], with lyrics by [[Keith Forsey]], and performed by [[Limahl|Christopher \"Limahl\" Hamill]], once the lead singer of [[Kajagoogoo]], and [[Beth Anderson (singer)|Beth Anderson]]. Released as a single in 1984, it peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart, No.&nbsp;6 on the US ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart, and No.&nbsp;17 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot&nbsp;100]]. The song has been covered by [[Armonite]], [[The Birthday Massacre]], [[Creamy]], [[Dragonland]], [[Kenji Haga]] and [[New Found Glory]]. More recent covers were done by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[synthpop]] group [[Echo Image]] on their [[2001 in music|2001]] [[maxi-single]] ''Skulk'' and by [[Germany|German]] [[techno]] group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]] on their [[2007 in music|2007]] album ''[[Jumping All Over the World]]''. This Limahl song, along with other \"techno-pop\" treatments to the soundtrack, is not present in the German version of the film, which features Doldinger's orchestral score exclusively. It was also performed by Dustin and Suzie from the television series ''[[Stranger Things]]''.\n\nIn 1994, [[Italy|Italian]] [[house music]] group [[Club House (band)|Club House]] released the song \"Nowhere Land\", featuring Carl, which combines the melody of the tune \"Bastian's Happy Flight\" with original lyrics.\n\nAn official soundtrack album was released featuring Doldinger's score and Moroder's theme tune (Moroder also rescored several scenes for the version released outside Germany).<ref>{{cite web | title=Klaus Doldinger / Original Soundtrack \u2013 Never Ending Story | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-neverending-story-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000651892 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The track listing (Doldinger is responsible for everything from track&nbsp;6 onwards) is as follows:\n{{Track listing\n| headline = ''The NeverEnding Story (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)''\n| collapsed = yes\n| title1 = [[The NeverEnding Story (song)|The NeverEnding Story]]\n| length1 = 3:31\n| title2 = Swamps of Sadness\n| length2 = 1:57\n| title3 = Ivory Tower\n| length3 = 3:10\n| title4 = Ruined Landscape\n| length4 = 3:03\n| title5 = Sleepy Dragon\n| length5 = 3:59\n| title6 = Bastian's Happy Flight\n| length6 = 3:16\n| title7 = Fantasia\n| length7 = 0:56\n| title8 = Atreyu's Quest\n| length8 = 2:52\n| title9 = Theme of Sadness\n| length9 = 2:43\n| title10 = Atreyu Meets Falkor\n| length10 = 2:31\n| title11 = Mirror Gate \u2013 Southern Oracle\n| length11 = 3:10\n| title12 = Gmork\n| length12 = 0:29\n| title13 = Moon Child\n| length13 = 1:24\n| title14 = AURYN\n| length14 = 2:20\n| title15 = Happy Flight\n| length15 = 1:21\n}}\nIn Germany, an album featuring Doldinger's score was released.\n{{Track listing\n| headline = {{lang|de|Die Unendliche Geschichte \u2014 Das Album}}\n| collapsed = yes\n| title1 = {{lang|de|Flug auf dem Gl\u00fccksdrachen}} (Flight of the Luckdragon)\n| length1 = 3:12\n| title2 = {{lang|de|Die Unendliche Geschichte (Titelmusik)}} (The NeverEnding Story (Main Title))\n| length2 = 2:44\n| title3 = {{lang|de|Im Haulewald}} (In the Howling Forest)\n| length3 = 3:01\n| title4 = {{lang|de|Der Elfenbeinturm}} (The Ivory Tower)\n| length4 = 1:54\n| title5 = {{lang|de|Atr\u00e9jus Berufung \u2013 AURYN Thema}} (Atreyu's Quest \u2013 AURYN Theme)\n| length5 = 2:47\n| title6 = {{lang|de|Phant\u00e1sien}} (Fantasia)\n| length6 = 0:52\n| title7 = {{lang|de|Artax's Tod}} (The Death of Artax)\n| length7 = 1:13\n| title8 = {{lang|de|Die S\u00fcmpfe der Traurigkeit}} (The Swamps of Sadness)\n| length8 = 2:39\n| title9 = {{lang|de|Atr\u00e9ju's Flug}} (Atreyu's Flight)\n| length9 = 2:27\n| title10 = {{lang|de|Die uralte Morla}} (Morla, the Ancient One)\n| length10 = 2:27\n| title11 = {{lang|de|Das s\u00fcdliche Orakel}} (The Southern Oracle)\n| length11 = 3:19\n| title12 = {{lang|de|Die drei magischen Tore}} (The Three Magic Gates)\n| length12 = 3:25\n| title13 = {{lang|de|Spukstadt}} (Spook City)\n| length13 = 1:37\n| title14 = {{lang|de|Flug zum Elfenbeinturm}} (Flight to the Ivory Tower)\n| length14 = 3:02\n| title15 = {{lang|de|Mondenkind}} (Moon Child)\n| length15 = 1:19\n| title16 = {{lang|de|Die kindliche Kaiserin}} (The Childlike Empress)\n| length16 = 2:16\n| title17 = {{lang|de|Flug auf dem Gl\u00fccksdrachen (Schlu\u00dftitel)}} (Flight of the Luckdragon (End Title))\n| length17 = 1:19\n}}\n\n=== Charts ===\n{|class=\"wikitable \n!
