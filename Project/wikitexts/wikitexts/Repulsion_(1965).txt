Based on a story written by Polanski and [[G\u00e9rard Brach]], the plot follows Carol, a withdrawn, disturbed young woman who, when left alone in the apartment she shares with her sister, is subject to a number of nightmarish experiences. The film focuses on the point of view of Carol and her vivid hallucinations and nightmares as she comes into contact with men and their desires for her. [[Ian Hendry]], [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]], [[Patrick Wymark]], and [[Yvonne Furneaux]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nShot in London, it is Polanski's first English-language film<ref>{{cite web|title=Repulsion|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074qf1|website=BBC Programmes|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref> and second feature-length production, following ''[[Knife in the Water]]'' (1962).\n\nThe film debuted at the [[1965 Cannes Film Festival]] before receiving theatrical releases internationally. Upon its release, ''Repulsion'' received considerable critical acclaim and currently is considered one of Polanski's greatest works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-morgan/roman-polanski-understand_b_301292.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=Roman Polanski Understands Women: Repulsion|date=27 September 2009|access-date=8 November 2013|last=Morgan|first=Kim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/26/entertainment/ca-secondlook26|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion'|series=A Second Look|date=26 July 2009|access-date=9 November 2013|last=Adams|first=Sam}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian-review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/03/repulsion-review|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Repulsion \u2013 review|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|date=3 January 2013|access-date=9 November 2013}}</ref> The film was nominated for a [[19th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[Gilbert Taylor]]'s cinematography.\n\n==Plot==\nCarol Ledoux, a beautiful and shy Belgian [[Manicure|manicurist]], lives in London with her older sister Helen. Carol is remarkably detached and struggles in her daily interactions. A suitor, Colin, is enamoured with her and makes fervent attempts to court her, but Carol seems uninterested. Carol is troubled by Helen's relationship with a married man named Michael, whom Carol seems to dislike. She is bothered by his habit of leaving his razor and toothbrush in her glass in the bathroom, and at night struggles to sleep, bothered by the sounds of her sister and Michael having sex.\n\nWhen Carol walks home from work one day, she is bothered by a crack in the pavement. Colin happens upon her and she struggles to converse with him. He drives her home and tries to kiss her several times, but she pulls away, running upstairs and vigorously brushing her teeth before weeping. That night, Helen questions Carol for dumping Michael's toothbrush and shaver in the bathroom trash bin. At the salon, Carol becomes increasingly distant, barely talking to her coworkers and customers, so much so that her boss decides to send her home for the day.\n\nThat night, Helen and Michael depart for Italy on holiday, leaving Carol alone in the apartment. Carol takes a rabbit out of the fridge for dinner. Instead of cooking it, she is distracted by a number of Michael's possessions left around the apartment, including an unwashed shirt whose odour makes her vomit. After trying on one of her sister's dresses, Carol sees a dark figure in the mirror. That night, she hears footsteps outside her bedroom. Carol's isolation begins to take its toll on her, and she misses three days of work. One morning, she runs a bath and walks away, causing it to overflow. As she turns on a light, the wall cracks open. She locks herself in her room and again hears footsteps. This time, she hallucinates that a man breaks into her room and rapes her. She is awakened in the hallway by a phone call from Colin, but she hangs up.\n\nAfter returning to the salon, Carol finds the uncooked rabbit's head in her purse. While she is giving a manicure, she cuts her client's finger and is sent home early. At the apartment, Carol stares at an old family photo and the wall behind the photograph shatters like a mirror. Colin subsequently arrives at the apartment, but Carol refuses to open the door so he breaks in. He declares his love for her, and she responds by bludgeoning him to death with a candlestick. She cleans the blood, barricades the front door, and places Colin's corpse in the bathtub. In bed, she experiences the same rape hallucination. She wakes up the next morning, naked on the floor. In a subsequent scene, she walks down the dark hallway of her apartment where hands appear out of the walls and grab her. Later, the angry wife of Michael calls looking for Helen, causing Carol to cut the wire of the telephone.\n\nThe landlord arrives to collect Carol and Helen's rent. After he is unable to get in due to the barricade, he breaks into the apartment and sees Carol. She pays him the rent, but he is disgusted by the state of the apartment. He sees the uncooked rabbit, still sitting out, rotting. He propositions Carol, offering to forget about the rent if she \"takes care of him\", and tries to rape her when she doesn't respond. She pushes him off and then hacks him to death with Michael's straight razor. She then sinks deeper into hallucination.\n\nWhen Helen and Michael arrive home, Helen is dismayed at the state of the place. Michael happens on Helen hyperventilating and finds Colin's dead body in the bath. Helen finds Carol under her bed in a catatonic state. Her neighbours flood in as Michael picks her up and carries her out, smiling. In the living room, a family photo\u2014the one Carol pondered earlier\u2014shows Carol as a child, staring at an older male family member in the photograph with a look of loathing, while others in the photo smile for the camera.<!--Do not add your own opinion of what this signifies.
