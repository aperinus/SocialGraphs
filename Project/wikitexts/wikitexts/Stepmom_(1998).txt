The screenplay was written by [[Gigi Levangie]], [[Jessie Nelson (filmmaker)|Jessie Nelson]], [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]], Karen Leigh Hopkins, and [[Ronald Bass]]. The film stars [[Julia Roberts]], [[Susan Sarandon]], and [[Ed Harris]], and follows a terminally ill woman dealing with her ex-husband's new lover, who will be their children's [[stepmother]].\n\n''Stepmom'' was released in the United States on December 25, 1998, by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $159.7 million worldwide against a budget of $50 million. Among other accolades, Sarandon was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nJackie and Luke Harrison are a [[divorce]]d [[New York City]] couple struggling to co-parent their children Anna and Ben. Luke, an [[Lawyer|attorney]], is living with his girlfriend of one year, Isabel Kelly, a successful fashion photographer several years his junior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2010/10/28/some-of-the-best-fictional-nyu-characters/ |title = Great Fictional Characters of NYU {{!}} by NYU Local {{!}} NYU Local}}</ref>\n\nIsabel, who has never wanted to be a mother, tries hard to make Anna and Ben feel comfortable with her. Anna repeatedly rejects her overtures while Ben, who likes her, adds extra complications with his mischievousness. Isabel behaves with contempt tempered by caution around Jackie, believing she overcompensates for the divorce by spoiling her children.\n\nJackie, a former [[publisher]] turned [[stay-at-home mom]], treats Isabel coldly, seeing her as an immature, selfish, overly ambitious career woman. She also continues to harbor malice towards Luke, as seen in confrontations about Isabel's parenting. After many arguments and hurt feelings involving Isabel, Jackie, and Anna, Luke proposes to Isabel, making her Anna and Ben's future official [[stepmother]]. This causes even more friction.\n\nIn a plot twist, Jackie has been silently battling [[lymphoma]] for some time, and the results of her latest scans say the disease is now terminal. She experiences a range of negative emotions, specifically jealousy of the woman who she feels is replacing her, and anger that after all of the sacrifices she made for her children, she will never see them grow up. Jackie actively sabotages Isabel's effort to bond with the children, even to the point of refusing to allow Isabel to take Anna to see [[Pearl Jam]] and then later taking her to the concert herself.\n\nIsabel and Anna's relationship eventually improves, and they bond over shared hobbies: painting and music. Isabel confronts Jackie, so she informs Luke and the children of her diagnosis, resulting in Anna emotionally storming out. That night, Jackie loosens up the tension by singing and dancing to \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\" with Anna and Ben.\n\nJackie and Isabel continue to have disagreements, largely over Isabel's parenting. When Ben goes missing on Isabel's watch, Jackie threatens legal action and claims that she has never lost him, which she later admits to be untrue. At school, Anna is bullied by a boy she once liked and the two women give her conflicting advice, causing more tension.\n\nJackie later invites Isabel to have dinner with her, and they work out a shaky truce, coming to terms with Jackie's impending passing and Isabel's role of stepmother. They bond when Isabel reveals her admiration of Jackie's maternal instincts, while Jackie in turn praises Isabel's hipness as a means to connect with Anna. Isabel finally lets her guard down when she tells Jackie her biggest fear is that on Anna's wedding day, all she will wish for is her mother's presence, while Jackie admits her own fear is that she will forget her. They come to understand that while Jackie will always have the children's past, Isabel will have their future, and the children can love them both without choosing.\n\nOn Christmas morning, the family gathers to celebrate together. Jackie, now largely bedridden, shares emotional moments with her children individually, telling them that she will remain with them as long as they remember her. Isabel takes a family portrait of Luke and Jackie with the children. Jackie demonstrates her acceptance of Isabel by inviting her to join them, stating, \"Let's get a photo with the whole family.\" Isabel sits next to Jackie for the photo and as the closing credits begin, both women are shown side by side, holding hands and at peace with each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Isabel Kelly\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Jackie Harrison\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Luke Harrison\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Anna Harrison\n* [[Liam Aiken]] as Ben Harrison\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Dr. Sweikert\n* [[Darrell Larson]] as Duncan Samuels\n* [[Mary Louise Wilson]] as School Counselor\n* Andre B.
