The script was written by Verhoeven and [[Gerard Soeteman]]. The story is set in the year 1501 in [[Italy]], during the [[early modern period]], and follows two warring groups of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and their longstanding quarrel.\n\nThe script is partly based on unused material for the Dutch [[Television show|TV series]] ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'', which was the debut for Verhoeven, Soeteman and Hauer. The film, originally titled ''God's Own Butchers'',<ref>[https://dansmediadigest.co.uk/flesh-blood-1985-642372976411 Flesh + Blood (1985), by Dan Owen] 08-10-2018, Dans Media Digest</ref>{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} was also known as '''''The Rose and the Sword''''' on early [[VHS]] releases. It was Verhoeven's first English-language film.{{sfn|Maltin|2017|page=475}}\n\nThe film was a huge [[box office bomb|box office flop]], only managing to make back {{USD}}100,000 out of its estimated {{USD}}6.5 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1501, a city in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] has been taken by a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] while its rightful ruler, Arnolfini (Fernando Hilbeck), is away. Arnolfini promises some mercenaries 24 hours of [[looting]] if they succeed in retaking the city, and they do so well, raping and killing those who stand in their way. But in their revelry, Arnolfini decides that he wants them gone. Hawkwood ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]), the [[Condottiero|commander]] of the troops, is caring for a young [[nun]] he mistakenly attacked during the siege. Arnolfini promises to get medical attention for her and Hawkwood leads Arnolfini's cavalry, betraying his former lieutenant, Martin (Rutger Hauer). The cavalry ejects the mercenaries from the city without their loot. Soon after, Martin's son is [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. Burying the infant unearths a wooden statue of [[Saint Martin of Tours]]\u2014a saint with a sword. The mercenaries' [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] views this as a sign from God to follow Martin as their new leader.\n[[File:Wolframs-Eschenbach - St.Sebastian - Hochaltar 3 St.Martin.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] holding a sword]]\n\nArnolfini's son, Steven ([[Tom Burlinson]]), is betrothed to Agnes ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]). They meet for the first time and eat from a [[mandrake]] to magically fall in love, then the entourage is attacked and robbed by Martin's band. Arnolfini is seriously injured; Kathleen, Agnes's lady-in-waiting, is stabbed in the chest and dies; and Agnes is hauled away, concealed among her valuable dowry. Martin discovers Agnes later that evening as they strip the caravan of valuables. The men desire to [[gang rape]] her but Martin decides to take her himself. He rapes Agnes while she at first taunts him and then begins to flirt with him, hoping to gain Martin's protection.\n\nThe mercenaries come upon a castle where, unknown to them, the inhabitants are infected with the [[Black Death|plague]]. They capture the castle easily with the help of Agnes. She induces Martin to fall in love with her and works on the other mercenaries to accept her. She appears to have given up on her former life. Meanwhile, Steven is determined to rescue her and turns to Hawkwood. Hawkwood only wants to live a quiet life, married to the former nun he had injured. Steven, becoming as ruthless as his father, seizes the nun to force Hawkwood to help his pursuit of Martin. They locate Martin and the mercenaries. They do not have sufficient force to take the castle and lay [[siege]] to it. In the castle, Martin asks Agnes where her true loyalty lies; she is noncommittal, hinting that the winner takes all. Outside, the plague spreads among Steven's forces and infects Hawkwood.\n\nSteven builds a [[siege tower]] to storm the castle, and Martin destroys it with something Steven had tried earlier: [[gunpowder]]. Steven's soldiers are killed as Steven scales the tower's ladders, and he falls into the castle grounds. The mercenaries capture Steven and shackle him in the courtyard. Agnes pretends to join in the abuse of the captive Steven and even makes love to Martin in his presence. Using a new medical technique Steven had learned (cutting the buboes on the infected body), Hawkwood cures his plague. He cannot continue the siege alone but, before leaving for additional troops, he catapults pieces of an infected dog into the castle. One chunk lands near the chained Steven, who flings it into the castle's water well. Agnes sees this and Steven tells her that she can decide whether to tell the mercenaries.\n\nThe mercenaries wish to leave the castle, fearing the plague, but Martin persuades them to stay. At the next meal, Agnes watches as they drink infected water. As Martin begins to drink, she slaps the cup from his hand. Many mercenaries soon show signs of the plague sickness and hurl Martin into the well. As she did after Steven's capture, Agnes pretends to join in the abuse of Martin. Hawkwood and Arnolfini have recovered from their wounds and return with an army. Inside the castle, Steven needs Martin's key to escape from the shackles, and Martin needs Steven to get out of the well. The two cooperate, but upon seeing the besieging army, Martin flees to the belfry. Steven frees himself and, as the battle rages, races to find Agnes. During the fighting, the belfry catches fire. Before long, all the mercenaries but Martin, Polly, Anna, and Little John are dead.\n\nMartin confronts Agnes. She claims that she loves him, but he prepares to murder her rather than allow her to return to Steven. As Martin is strangling Agnes, Steven attacks. Martin, a cunning and hardened mercenary, overpowers Steven. He almost drowns him, but Agnes strikes Martin on the head, and she and Steven flee the blazing castle and reunite with Hawkwood. As Agnes and Steven embrace, Agnes sees Martin over Steven's shoulder, escaping from the castle, a sack of loot on his shoulder. She says nothing.{{sfn|Fischer|2017|page=633}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Martin, a mercenary\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Agnes, virgin daughter of an aristocrat\n* [[Tom Burlinson]] as Steven, learned son of Arnolfini\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Hawkwood ([[John Hawkwood]]), a captain of mercenaries\n* Fernando Hilbeck as Arnolfini, feudal lord\n* [[Susan Tyrrell]] as Celine, a drunken prostitute attached to Martin\n* [[Ronald Lacey]] as Cardinal, a visionary\n* [[Brion James]] as Karsthans, a mercenary\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Orbec, a mercenary\n* [[Simon Andreu]] as Miel, a mercenary\n* [[John Dennis Johnston]] as Summer, a mercenary\n* Marina Saura as Polly, a prostitute\n* [[Kitty Courbois]] as Anna\n* [[Jake Wood]] as Little John, Anna's son\n* [[Nancy Cartwright (actress)|Nancy Cartwright]] as Kathleen, Agnes's lady-in-waiting\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Alterio]] as Niccolo\n* [[Blanca Marsillach]] as Clara\n* Jorge Bosso as Sterz\n* Mario De Barros as Herman\n* Hans Veerman as Father George, a physician\n* Ida Bons as Roly Poly\n* Jaime Segura as Lord of the Castle\n* Bettina Brenner as Lady of the Castle\n* [[Siobhan Hayes]] as Child of the Castle\n* Susan Beresford as Sturdy Woman\n* M\u00f2nica Lucchetti as Tongueless Girl\n* [[Anne Lockhart (actress)|Anne Lockhart]] as Wife\n\n== Production ==\nAfter tiring of attempting to have his controversial Dutch films [[Subsidy|subsidized]] by the government, Verhoeven looked elsewhere for funding for ''Flesh and Blood'', eventually securing most of the budget from Hollywood studio [[Orion Pictures]].{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} However, Orion soon requested changes, feeling that the film needed a love interest; thus, instead of focusing on the relationship between Hawkwood and Martin, Agnes was introduced and attention turned to her romantic entanglement with both Martin and Steven.{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} Verhoeven later said: \"The triangular relationship [of] Martin\u2013Agnes\u2013Steven is now the main story line, but in [[Retrospective|retrospect]] I think we should have stuck with Hawkwood and Martin. The failure of ''Flesh and Blood'' was a lesson for me: never again compromise on the main story line of a script.\"{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}}\n\n[[File:Belmonte Castillo 01 JMM.jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Belmonte (Cuenca)|Castle of Belmonte]]]]\nIn addition to a cast featuring American, Australian, British and Dutch actors, attempting to handle an international co-production funded by multiple sources who all wanted to take the film in different directions overwhelmed Verhoeven, who had also not storyboarded the film in a bid to achieve a \"looser visual approach\".{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} There were a number of delays and disagreements because of the subsequent [[improvisation]]al style of filming; many members of the cast and crew also arrived and left when they pleased to party on a local beach.{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} One of the most notable disagreements was between Verhoeven and Hauer, who wanted to cultivate a reputation for playing heroic characters rather than villains, as he did in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} This was at odds with Verhoeven's intent to portray the [[Morality|moral]] ambiguity of its characters and the Middle Ages as a \"stinking time in which to live\" to distance it from typical [[medieval fantasy]] depictions of the period.{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}} This caused a bitter rift to develop between the two, who did not work together again.{{sfn|Keesey|2005|pages=86\u201393}}\n\nSome of the film was censored, including the rape sequence. This upset Jennifer Jason Leigh, who was opposed to censorship. \"It's a hard scene to watch,\" she said. \"Brutal and ugly as rape is, I know it's going to upset a lot of people.
