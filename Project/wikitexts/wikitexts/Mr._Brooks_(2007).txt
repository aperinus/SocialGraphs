Evans]] starring [[Kevin Costner]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Dane Cook]], and [[William Hurt]]. It was released on June 1, 2007. The film follows the [[eponymous]] character, a celebrated [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] businessman and [[serial killer]] (Costner) who is forced to take on a [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] (Cook) after being [[blackmail]]ed, and has to contend with his bloodthirsty [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|alter ego]] (Hurt) who convinces him to indulge his \"habit\". His life grows even more complicated when a driven police officer (Moore) reopens the investigation into his murders. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $48.1 million against a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nEarl Brooks, a respected businessman in [[Portland, Oregon]], leads a secret life as a [[serial killer]]. Despite his effort to curb his \"killing addiction,\" Brooks succumbs to his [[id, ego and superego|id]], Marshall, and kills a young couple in their bedroom. As part of his [[psychopathology]], Brooks leaves each victim's bloody thumbprint on a lampshade, an act that spawned the nickname the \"Thumbprint Killer\". He follows a meticulous [[modus operandi]], including fastidious preparation, cleansing the crime scene, posing the bodies, and even locking doors before departing. Brooks realizes later that the bedroom curtains were open during the murder, the window facing an apartment building.\n\nBrooks' daughter, Jane, unexpectedly arrives home and asks for a job at his company, having dropped out of college. Later, Brooks learns that Jane is [[pregnant]]. Soon after, the Brooks are visited by [[Palo Alto]] detectives investigating a murder in Jane's former campus dorm. Brooks realizes that Jane committed the murder. He briefly considers allowing her to be caught to \"save her\" from becoming like him. He changes his mind and commits a similar murder in Palo Alto to provide Jane with an alibi.\n\nA man calling himself \"Mister Smith\" approaches Brooks. Having a direct view at the murdered couple's bedroom, Smith took pictures of Brooks' crime. He demands to accompany Brooks during a murder. Brooks reluctantly agrees, warning Smith that killing can become addictive.\n\nDetective Tracy Atwood interviews Smith and several other residents living across from the latest crime scene. Brooks learns Atwood is undergoing a difficult divorce from her husband, Jesse Vialo. He decides that Vialo and his lawyer/lover, Sheila, will be Smith's first victims. At the scene of the Vialo murder, Smith [[urination|wets his pants]].\n\nLeaving the scene, Smith holds Brooks at gunpoint in panic. Brooks admits to being suicidal, having found his urges irrepressible. At a cemetery, Brooks tells Smith to kill him and dispose of his body in an open grave, sparing his family the shame of his crimes. Smith pulls the trigger. However, Brooks had previously tampered with the gun on the off-chance that he changes his mind. Brooks, deciding he wants to live and see his grandchild, kills Smith and hides his body in the open grave.\n\nWith the photos already destroyed, there is no evidence tying Brooks to the crimes. With Smith's urine the only DNA evidence tied to the Thumbprint Killer, the investigation is off Brooks' trail.\n\nBrooks anonymously calls Detective Atwood, whom he has come to admire. The brief conversation makes Atwood suspect Smith is not the Thumbprint Killer. That night, Brooks has a nightmare in which Jane murders him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Earl Brooks/The Thumbprint Killer\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Detective Tracy Atwood\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Graves Baffert/Mr Smith\n* [[William Hurt]] as Marshall, Brooks' id\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Emma Brooks\n* [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Detective Hawkins\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Jane Brooks\n* [[Aisha Hinds]] as Nancy Hart\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Captain Lister\n* [[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]] as Jesse Vialo\n* [[Reiko Aylesworth]] as Sheila\n* [[Matt Schulze]] as Thornton Meeks/The Hangman\n* Yasmine Delawari as Sunday\n* [[Traci Dinwiddie]] as Sarah Leaves\n* [[Michael Cole (actor)|Michael Cole]] as Atwood's lawyer\n* [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] as flight attendant\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Mr. Brooks'' opened in 2,453 theaters and grossed $10,017,067, with an average of $4,083 per theater and ranking #4 at the North American [[box office]].
