It was originally a student film titled ''Proof'' made by Reynolds while he was attending [[University of Southern California|USC]] film school. It was a parody of [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] at his alma mater [[Baylor University]]. However, due to his father's presidency at Baylor, he did not wish to portray the Baptist institution in an unfavorable light and gave it the alternative distinction as the [[University of Texas]].  The film is now a [[cult classic]].<ref>[https://www.tampabay.com/30-years-later-which-movie-would-you-watch-fandango-or-falcon-and-the/2215146/ \"30 years later, which movie would you watch: Fandango or Falcon and the Snowman?\"] ''Tampa Bay Times, Jan. 26, 2015''</ref><ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/fandango-the-sublime-marriage-of-music-and-image-2495422684.html \"The Sublime Marriage of Music and Image in Fandango\"] ''popMATTERS, Nov. 2, 2016''</ref>\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] saw the film and helped fund a feature-length comedy/drama about five college students from [[Texas]] in 1971 who go on a \"last road trip\" together, celebrating the \"privilege of youth\" as they face [[graduation]], [[marriage]] and [[Conscription|the draft]] for the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>McBride 2011, p. 603.</ref>\n\n''Fandango'' stars [[Kevin Costner]] (in his first starring role, although an earlier film where he had been the lead actor, ''[[The Gunrunner (film)|The Gunrunner]]'' had actually wrapped in 1983 but was not released until 1989), [[Judd Nelson]] and [[Sam Robards]].<ref name=\"Rejects\"/>{{#tag:ref|Costner had actually auditioned for a role in  ''Proof'', the original student film, but Reynolds had rejected him.<ref name=\"Rejects\">Abaius, Cole.

He rejoins the graduation party going on downstairs, but not before tearing the picture in half. Gardner is a member of a [[clique]] called the Groovers, whose other members include Kenneth Waggener ([[Sam Robards]]), engaged to be married, and [[ROTC]] geek Phil Hicks ([[Judd Nelson]]). Phil's parents arrive at the fraternity house just in time to see another Groover named Lester (Brian Cesak) pass out (and remain unconscious for most of the film). They also meet the strong, quiet [[seminary]] student Dorman ([[Chuck Bush]]).\n\nKenneth interrupts the festivities by announcing his [[Conscription in the United States|student deferment]] has expired and he is now to be drafted into the [[Vietnam War]]. Gardner is not surprised: his own notice came weeks before. Kenneth also reveals he has decided to call off his engagement to Debbie on account of being drafted. Gardner reacts with some joy and relief. The Groovers decide to celebrate their last days before the draft by going on a road trip, intending to visit a notorious [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]], then \"dig up\" someone - or something - named Dom near the [[Rio Grande]]. They drive all night before making a rest stop. Some, including Phil, resist continuing, but Gardner presses them on.\n\nPhil's car runs out of gas and the Groovers must decide whether to walk to the nearest town or hitch. Phil is adamant about not leaving his car behind, when someone gets the idea to lasso a train passing on the railroad track parallel to the road. Dorman successfully attaches the front bumper with some fence cable to the back of the train, but the car's front end is pulled off, leaving the car in place. The Groovers push the car to a garage in the nearest town and eat at a [[Sonic Drive-In]]. They meet up with some townie girls (one of whom is played by [[Elizabeth Daily]]) and eventually end up playing in a cemetery operated by one of the girls' undertaker father, where they come upon a fallen Vietnam War soldier's tombstone. They sleep at the former movie set of ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]''.\n\nThe next morning, with the car repaired with a front end from a different make and model, the Groovers continue. Phil wants to go back, prompting Kenneth to shout angrily at him. Gardner confesses they only let Phil hang with them because they felt sorry for him. Humiliated, Phil retorts that he will take on any challenge. The group sees a sign for a [[parachute]] school giving jumping lessons. Gardner cons the hippie-ish instructor Truman Sparks (Marvin J. McIntyre) into giving Phil a free lesson. Phil is terrified but goes up into Truman's aircraft. However, he is carrying Truman's dirty laundry instead of a parachute. The boys try desperately to warn him from the ground without success. Fortunately, Phil is able to open the emergency chute on his stomach with much prompting from Truman by [[walkie-talkie]]. The Groovers get a picture for their efforts; Phil gets some of his wounded pride back.\n\nAfter discovering the charred, abandoned remains of the roadhouse, the Groovers press onward. At last they reach a bluff overlooking the Rio Grande and dig up Dom \u2013 which turns out to be a magnum of [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (wine)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]] champagne. Each takes a drink before Gardner toasts to \"freedom and youth.\" Kenneth is disheartened, having second thoughts about calling off the engagement. Pondering on the nature of love, Gardner decides to make things right. He calls Debbie, gets her to re-accept the engagement, and arranges for Truman Sparks to fly her from [[Dallas]] to the border town and back. Through some trickery, reminiscent of [[stone soup]], he sets up a beautiful wedding for Kenneth and Debbie. Debbie and Gardner share one last dance after the wedding.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Phil gives Kenneth and Debbie his car as a wedding present. Lester goes to hitch a ride \"anywhere\" and Phil and Dorman shake hands before leaving. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the town and watching the wedding reception, Gardner lifts a beer in salute to his friends.{{#tag:ref|The action of saluting his friends, leaves the audience to wonder if Gardner has left without saying goodbye in order to travel on to Mexico, thus avoiding the draft; or has he left his friends to avoid the pain of their departure and the last \"Groover adventure.\"|group=Note}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Gardner Barnes\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as Phil Hicks\n* [[Sam Robards]] as Kenneth Waggener\n* [[Chuck Bush]] as Dorman\n* [[E.
