It is one of the first films based directly on a toy line (and the first based on Care Bears), it introduced the [[Care Bears]] characters and their companions the [[Care Bear Cousins]].{{#tag:ref|Introduced by American Greetings in 1984,<ref name=guilford>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKk7r9uEgrIC&q=Care+Bears+Movie&pg=PA52|last=Pecora|first=Norma Odom|title=The Business of Children's Entertainment|chapter=The Industries: Television and Toy|pages=52\u201355|isbn=1-57230-774-9|year=2002|access-date=November 13, 2010|publisher=Guilford Press}}</ref> the Care Bear Cousins are a group of animals who serve as relatives to the Care Bears.<ref name=gainesville>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKkRAAAAIBAJ&pg=4657,3747590&dq=dark-heart&hl=en|last=McLane|first=Mike|title=The Care Bears don't disappoint|date=March 28, 1986|access-date=November 13, 2010|work=[[Gainesville Sun]] Scene Magazine|page=20|via=Google News Archive}}</ref> The group consists of different species, such as monkeys, elephants and penguins.<ref name=gainesville/>|group=nb}} In the film, an orphanage owner ([[Mickey Rooney]]) tells a story about the Care Bears, who live in a cloud-filled land called Care-a-Lot. Traveling across Earth, the Bears help two lonely children named Kim and Jason, who lost their parents in a car accident, and also save a young magician's apprentice named Nicholas from an evil spirit's influence. Deep within a place called the Forest of Feelings, Kim, Jason, and their friends soon meet another group of creatures, the Care Bear Cousins.\n\n[[American Greetings]], the owners of the Care Bears characters, began development of a feature film adaptation in 1981. Later on, the card company chose Nelvana to produce it, granted them rights to the characters, and financed the film along with cereal manufacturer [[General Mills]] and television syndicator [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications]]. Nelvana's founders served as producers, while fellow employee [[Arna Selznick]] directed the film. Production lasted eight months, with a production budget of at least $2 million, and took place in Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea. The voice cast included [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Georgia Engel]], [[Jackie Burroughs]] and [[Cree Summer]]. Two pop music stars, [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]], contributed several songs. Although major American film studios passed on the project, newly established independent distributor [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] acquired the distribution rights to the film and soon spent a record $24 million promoting it.\n\nThe film premiered on March 24, 1985, in Washington, D.C., and was released in North America on March 29, 1985.{{#tag:ref|In the US and Canadian domestic market, wide release occurs when a film is playing in 600 or more theatres.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/about/boxoffice.htm|title=About Movie Box Office Tracking and Terms|access-date=November 13, 2010|website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>|group=nb}} Another Nelvana work, ''[[Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins]]'', played alongside the feature in theatres. ''The Care Bears Movie'' received mixed reviews from critics, who raised concern over its potential as a full-length advertisement for the title characters among other aspects. It went on to earn $23 million domestically; it was the highest-grossing Canadian film during 1985 (with C$1.845 million), it won a [[Golden Reel Award (Canada)|Golden Reel Award]]. With over $34 million in worldwide sales, it set a box-office record for Canadian and non-[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animation, and has remained one of Goldwyn's largest-earning releases. The film's success saved Nelvana from closing and helped revive films aimed at children in the US market. It has since been cited as inspiring a spate of toy-based animated and live-action features. It was soon followed by two sequels, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation|A New Generation]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland|Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987); neither surpassed the original financially or critically. The Care Bears franchise continues and has included television series, specials, videos, and films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nThe Cherrywoods are a middle-aged couple who run an [[orphanage]]. One night, Mr. Cherrywood tells the orphans a story about the Care Bears and Care-a-Lot, their home in the clouds. In the story, Friend Bear and Secret Bear travel down to [[Earth]], looking for people to cheer up. On Earth, they meet Kim and Jason, two lonely orphaned children whose parents were killed in a [[car accident]]. Friend Bear and Secret Bear introduce themselves and remind the children of their ambitions, but neither of them are interested.\n\nAt an [[amusement park]], Tenderheart Bear spots a [[Magician (paranormal)|mage]]'s apprentice named Nicholas. While unloading a trunk of goods for his master, known as the \"Great Fettucini\", Nicholas finds an old book with a diary-style lock. When he unlocks it, an evil spirit appears as a woman's face, and brainwashes him. With his help, it lays waste to the park, and begins a quest to remove all caring from the world.\n\nBack at Care-a-Lot, some of the other bears are working on their new invention: the Rainbow Rescue Beam, a portal that can send any bear to Earth and back. The two Care Bear cubs belonging to Grams Bear, Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs, interfere with it and bring forth a group of unexpected visitors: Friend Bear, Secret Bear, Kim, and Jason. The bears introduce themselves to the children, and give them a tour of their home. Tenderheart Bear returns just before a \"cloudquake\" caused by the spirit, which ruins Care-a-Lot. He informs the others of Nicholas' troubles on Earth. Using the Rainbow Rescue Beam, he sends Kim and Jason to the park, along with Friend Bear and Secret Bear. They end up in the Forest of Feelings when the portal malfunctions. From a nearby river, the rest of the bears begin searching for them aboard a cloud ship called the Cloud Clipper, leaving behind Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Grams Bear and the cubs in Care-a-Lot. Meanwhile, Nicholas is informed of Kim and Jason and the Care Bears, and summons a cloud-like evil demon to capture them.\n\nWithin the Forest, the Bears and children are introduced to Brave Heart Lion and Playful Heart Monkey, two of the Care Bear Cousins. Later on, the other Bears aboard their ship discover more of the Cousins, among them Cozy Heart Penguin, Lotsa Heart Elephant, Swift Heart Rabbit, and Bright Heart Raccoon. During their stay, the demon attacks them in several disguises: a fish, tree, and eagle. After the Care Bears and their Cousins defeat it, they venture back to Earth to save Nicholas.\n\nAt the park, Nicholas obtains the ingredients for his \"final spell\" against the children and the Bears and Cousins, while Kim and Jason go into hiding. After he casts it, the Care Bears and company engage in a long battle. The bears unleash beams of bright light on him, forming their \"Stare\"; the Cousins help with their \"Call\" \u2013 Good Luck Bear and Grumpy Bear arriving in time to help after fixing the Rainbow Rescue Beam. As the Bears' and Cousins' strength drains away, Nicholas and the spirit briefly regain control. Kim and Jason arrive to reach out to him, and Nicholas finally realizes his misdeeds and shakes off the spirit's influence. He closes the book, which Jason then locks. Having saved himself, the park, and the world, Nicholas thanks the group. He reunites with Fettucini, while Tenderheart Bear inducts the Care Bear Cousins into the Care Bear Family. Kim and Jason find new parents who take them to one of Nicholas' shows.\n\nAs Mr. Cherrywood finishes his story, it is revealed that he is Nicholas. Tenderheart Bear, who has been listening from outside a window, smiles and returns to Care-a-Lot.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 6px;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:darkGrey; width:300px;\"|Name\n! style=\"background:darkGrey;
