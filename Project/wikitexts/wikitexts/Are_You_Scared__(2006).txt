It stars Carlee Avers, Brad Ashten, and Soren Bowie. An unrelated sequel, called '''''Are You Scared 2''''', was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nSix young people wake up in an abandoned building, with no idea of what is going on or how they got there. A mysterious figure speaks to them over a [[PA system]] and tells them that they are on a game show called ''Are You Scared?''  They will have to face their deepest fears in order to win the contest.  However, their challenges are real \u2013 and deadly.  The show involves several \"contests\", each of which result in the grisly deaths of the contestants, including death by acid, explosion, shotgun, hungry rats, strangulation, power drill, and decapitation.\n\n==Cast==\n* Alethea Kutscher as Kelly\n* Erin Consalvi as Cherie\n* Brad Ashten as Brandon\n* Carlee Avers as Laura\n* Kariem Markbury as Jason\n* Soren Bowie as Dylan\n* Eric Francis as Det.
