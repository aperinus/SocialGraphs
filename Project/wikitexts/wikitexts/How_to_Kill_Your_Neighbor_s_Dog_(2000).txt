It stars [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]].\n\n==Plot==\nPeter McGowan is a [[chain smoking|chain-smoking]], [[impotence|impotent]], [[insomnia]]c British [[playwright]] who lives in [[Los Angeles]]. Once very successful, he is now in the tenth year of a decade-long string of production failures. His latest play is in the hands of effeminate director Brian Sellars, who is obsessed with [[Petula Clark]]; his wife Melanie is determined to have a baby; he finds himself bonding with a new neighbor's lonely young daughter who has mild [[cerebral palsy]]; and during one of his middle-of-the-night strolls, he encounters his oddball [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] who claims to be Peter McGowan and develops a friendship of sorts with him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Peter McGowen\n* [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]] as Melanie McGowen\n* [[Jared Harris]] as \"Pseudo\"/\"False\" Peter McGowen\n* Suzi Hofrichter as Amy Walsh\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Edna\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Larry\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Brian Sellars\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Adam\n* [[Kaitlin Hopkins]] as Victoria\n* Suzy Joachim as Allana\n* Brett Rickaby as Janitor\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Trina Walsh\n* Derek Kellock as Amy's Father\n* Stacy Hogue as Babysitter\n* [[Peri Gilpin]] as Debra Salhany\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Petula Clark]]'s recordings of \"[[I Couldn't Live Without Your Love]]\" and \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" were heard during the opening and [[closing credits]] respectively, and \"Downtown 99\", a [[disco]] remix of her 1964 classic \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", was heard during a party scene. Additional songs originally recorded by Petula Clark were sung by the character of Brian Sellars throughout the film.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 59% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 34 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_to_kill_your_neighbors_dog|title=How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog (2002)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=5 July 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] described the film as \"a Hollywood rarity, a movie about an icy grown-up heart-warmed by a child that doesn't wield emotional pliers to try to squeeze out tears\u2026. It is a tribute to Mr. Branagh's considerable comic skills that he succeeds in making a potentially insufferable character likable by infusing him with the same sly charm that [[Michael Caine]] musters to seduce us into cozying up to his sleazier alter egos\u2026. Mr. Kalesniko's satirically barbed screenplay, whose spirit harks back to the comic heyday of [[Blake Edwards]], stirs up an insistent verbal energy that rarely flags.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen Holden |date=February 22, 2002 |title=Film Review; A Tale of 2 Neighbors, Both Pains in the Neck |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/22/movies/film-review-a-tale-of-2-neighbors-both-pains-in-the-neck.html |access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the movie a B and said, \"Branagh, in his most forceful non-[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] screen performance, grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |date=February 15, 2002 |title=How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/02/15/how-kill-your-neighbors-dog/ |access-date=June 19, 2016 |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman}}</ref> Justine Elias of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated it was \"slight but unendurable\u2026its fractured time frame gets confusing\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Elias |first=Justine |date=February 19, 2002 |title=Criminal Mischief |work=[[The Village Voice]] |location=New York |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/criminal-mischief-6414235 |access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the closing night film at the [[2000 Toronto International Film Festival]] and won multiple festival awards.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite news |last1=Kilday |first1=Gregg |title=Toronto Flashback: Kenneth Branagh Revealed His Lighter Side in 2000 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/toronto-film-festival-kenneth-branagh-how-to-kill-your-neighbors-dog-movie-1235010760/ |access-date=6 October 2022 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2021-09-10}}</ref><ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web |title=How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/434107/how-to-kill-your-neighbors-dog#notes |website=Turner Classic Movie Database |access-date=6 October 2022}}</ref> It was released as ''Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mad Dogs and Englishmen DVD |url=https://www.amazon.com.au/Mad-Dogs-Englishmen-Kenneth-Branagh/dp/B01FR38NIU |access-date=6 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0207524|How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog}}\n* ''[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/how-to-kill-your-neighbors-dog-v206899 How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog]'' at [[AllMovie]]\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about people with cerebral palsy]]\n[[Category:Nu Image films]]\n[[Category:Films about identity theft]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael Nozik]]\n[[Category:Films shot in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Midlife crisis films]]\n[[Category:2000 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000 independent films]]\n[[Category:Films about playwrights]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]"}]}}}}
