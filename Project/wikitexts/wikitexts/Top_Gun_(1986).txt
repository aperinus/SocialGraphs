The screenplay was written by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], which in turn was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\", written by Ehud Yonay and published in ''[[California (magazine, defunct 1991)|California]]'' magazine three years earlier. It stars [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young [[naval aviator]] aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}. He and his [[radar intercept officer]], [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw ([[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]]), are given the chance to train at the US Navy's [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Fighter Weapons School]] (Top Gun) at [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar#Naval Air Station|Naval Air Station Miramar]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

During an interception with two hostile [[MiG-28]]s,{{efn|group=A|Fictional planes portrayed by [[Northrop F-5]]s}} Maverick missile-locks on one, while the other hostile locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. Maverick drives it off, but Cougar is so shaken that Maverick defies orders to land and shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar resigns his commission. Maverick and Goose are sent in his place by [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] \"Stinger\" to attend [[United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program|Top Gun]], the Naval Fighter Weapons School at [[Naval Air Station Miramar]].\n\nPrior to the first day of instruction, Maverick unsuccessfully approaches a woman at a bar. He learns the next day she is an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and civilian Top Gun instructor Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with a MiG-28. In Maverick's first training hop, he defeats instructor Lieutenant Commander Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly, but to do so, he flies below {{Convert|10000|ft}}, breaking a major [[rule of engagement]]. Maverick and Goose also buzz the control tower when specifically told not to do so. They are reprimanded by chief instructor Commander Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf.\n\nPrivately, Jester tells Viper that while he admires Maverick's skill, he is not sure if he would trust him as a teammate in combat. In class, Charlie objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics against the MiG-28, but privately tells him she admires his flying; they begin a romantic relationship.\n\nOn training Hop 19, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper. As a result, first Hollywood and then Maverick are defeated in a demonstration of the value of teamwork. Jester tells Maverick his flying is excellent, but criticizes him for leaving his wingman. Maverick\u2019s rival, Lieutenant Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky calls his behavior \"foolish\", \"dangerous\" and worse than the enemy, to which Maverick responds \u201cI am dangerous\u201d. \n\nMaverick and Iceman, the leading contenders for the Top Gun Trophy, chase an [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4]] in Hop 31. As Iceman has trouble getting a lock on the A-4, Maverick pressures him to break off so that he can move into firing position. However, Maverick's F-14 flies through Iceman's [[Wake turbulence|jet wash]] and suffers a [[flameout]] of both engines, going into an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]]. Maverick and Goose [[ejection seat|eject]], but Goose is killed when his head slams into the jettisoned [[aircraft canopy]].\n\nThe board of inquiry clears Maverick of any wrongdoing, but he is shaken and guilt-ridden, and considers quitting. He seeks advice from Viper, who flew with Maverick's father in the [[Vietnam War]]-era air battle where he was killed. Contrary to official reports faulting Mitchell, Viper says he died heroically. He tells him he can succeed if he regains his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate and congratulates Iceman, who has won the Top Gun Trophy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick receive immediate deployment orders to deal with a crisis situation; they are sent to the ''Enterprise'' to provide air support for the rescue of the SS ''Layton'', a disabled communication ship that drifted into hostile waters.\n\nAboard ''Enterprise'', Iceman and Hollywood are assigned to provide air cover, with Maverick and RIO Merlin on standby. Iceman expresses his concerns to Stinger about Maverick's mental state, but is told to just do his job. Iceman and Hollywood are pulled into a dogfight with what first appear to be two MiGs, but turn out to be six. After Hollywood is shot down, Maverick is scrambled. He goes into a spin after encountering another jet wash, but recovers. Shaken, he breaks off, but then re-engages and shoots down three MiGs. Iceman destroys a fourth, and the remaining two MiGs withdraw. Upon their triumphant return to ''Enterprise'', the pilots share their newfound respect for one another. Finally confident and able to let go of the guilt caused by the training accident, Maverick later throws Goose's [[dog tags]] overboard.\n\nOffered the choice of any assignment, Maverick chooses to return to Top Gun as an instructor. He and Charlie reunite at a bar in Miramar.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening credits title card billing -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell: A US Navy pilot.
