Fox]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Phoebe Cates]], [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Jason Robards]], and based on [[Bright Lights, Big City (novel)|the novel]] by [[Jay McInerney]], who also wrote the screenplay. It was the last film directed by Bridges, who died in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows one week in the life of 24-year-old Jamie Conway. Originally from [[Pennsylvania]], Jamie works as a [[fact-checker]] for a major [[New York City]] [[magazine]]. His nights partying with his glib best friend Tad and his addiction to [[cocaine]] has led Jamie being frequently late to work and not finishing assignments on time. As result, he is on the verge of getting fired by his stern boss, Clara Tillinghast.\n\nHis wife Amanda, a fast-rising [[model (person)|model]], has just left him. He is also still reeling from the death of his mother from cancer a year earlier; and he follows a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] story about a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman in a [[coma]]. Jamie's story captures some of the glossy chaos and decadence of [[New York City|NYC]] nightlife during the [[1980s]] and Jamie also finds himself desperately trying to escape the pain in his life.\n\nAfter Jamie gets fired from his job, he goes on a further downward spiral with more substance and alcohol abuse. He attempts to go on a date with Tad's cousin Vicky as a favor so Tad could, in turn, have a fling with a woman he claims is a [[Penthouse Pet]]. Jamie also avoids phone calls from his younger brother Michael who has come to the city to look for him.\n\nHis maternal co-worker Megan attempts to help Jamie out with finding a new job as well as try to open up about his troubled life and the reason why Amanda left him. Michael arrives at his apartment and lets himself in, surprising Jamie. Tad calls him to tell him Amanda is at a party he is attending.\n\nAt the party, Tad is so intoxicated that he doesn't seem to realize that a woman he is flirting with is actually a [[drag queen|man in drag]]. Jamie confronts Amanda but retreats to the bathroom when his nose starts to bleed. He finally decides to open up and come clean with himself before he ends up either dead or in jail. Jamie phones Vicky from the party and tells her that he and his brother Michael helped their dying mother kill herself to end her suffering. Jamie then declines Tad's offer to spend more time together and leaves the party.\n\nJamie wanders the streets until dawn when he decides that today will be a better day to get his life back on track. As the film ends, a news clipping of the newborn \"Coma Baby\" is shown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Michael J.

McInerney wrote a draft of the screenplay and, soon afterward, Schumacher started rewriting it.<ref name= \"james\"/> Actor [[Emilio Estevez]] was interested in adapting it into a film.<ref name=\"New York\">{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/49902/ | last=Blum |first=David |author-link=David Blum |date=1985-06-10|title=Hollywood's Brat Pack |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |pages=40\u201347}}</ref> He met with McInerney while he was still working on the screenplay. [[Tom Cruise]] was offered first refusal on the script while McInerney and Schumacher were attempting to capture the novel's distinctive voice. McInerney, Cruise and Schumacher scouted locations in New York City and checked out the atmosphere of the club scenes described in the novel.<ref name= \"james\"/> At one point, [[Judd Nelson]], Estevez, [[Zach Galligan]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Kevin Bacon]], and [[Rob Lowe]] were all considered for the role of Allagash.<ref name= \"New York\"/>\n\nIn 1985, Weintraub took the property to [[United Artists]] when he became chief executive there.<ref name= \"james\"/> The film needed a new producer so [[Sydney Pollack]] and Mark Rosenberg took over. They hired writer Julie Hickson to write a script. Cruise and Schumacher grew tired of waiting for a workable script, but before they could be replaced, Weintraub left United Artists.<ref name= \"james\"/> The project became entangled in a complicated settlement with the studio, months being lost before it finally stayed at United Artists. A decision was made to shoot the film in [[Toronto]] and cast an unknown in the leading role.<ref name= \"james\"/>\n\n[[Joyce Chopra]] was hired to co-write the script, with her husband Tom Cole, and also direct it. She had her agent send a copy of McInerney's novel to Michael J. Fox.<ref name= \"james\"/> The actor won the leading role and, at his request, the part of Tad Allagash went to fellow Canadian Kiefer Sutherland.<ref name= \"godfrey\">{{cite news | last = Godfrey | first = Stephen | title = Some people have a terrible resentment of early success | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = February 26, 1988 }}</ref> Fox's casting increased the budget to $15 million and principal photography was moved to New York City.<ref name= \"godfrey\"/> The producers hired a crew, many of whom had worked with Pollack, while Chopra brought along the cinematographer from her first film, ''[[Smooth Talk]]'', James Glennon.<ref name= \"james\"/>\n\nFox had to be back in [[Los Angeles]] to start taping his television series ''[[Family Ties]]'' by mid-July, giving Chopra only ten weeks to finish the film. It was rumored that she was indecisive, relying too much on consulting with Glennon and Cole, wasting time over a single shot.<ref name= \"james\"/> It was also rumored that she panicked while shooting on the streets of New York City as fans of Fox disrupted filming. Chopra has said, \"I kept insisting that we take time each day to give the actors a chance to find their way, in spite of the panic caused all around us by the morning calls from United Artists asking if I had taken my first shot yet. Working collaboratively with my cameraman seemed to drive the producers into a sort of frenzy\".\n\nStudio executives did not like what Chopra was shooting and, a week into filming, the studio's chairman and its president of production flew from L.A. to New York City to check on the film. Neither had read the script and both were unaware of how different it was from the novel.<ref name= \"james\"/> (Many female directors were being fired from films around this time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-11/entertainment/ca-1274_1_woman-film-director|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=A Fired Woman Film Director\u2014New Questions, Issue Continues|date=March 11, 1988|first=Michael|last=Cieply}}</ref>)\n\nMcInerney has said that Cole wrote all the drugs out of the script while Cole said that he did this on instructions from Pollack, who was worried that the film would hurt Fox's wholesome image with audiences. Cole recalls, \"There was definitely pressure and concern at that time about how Michael was seen by America.\"<ref name= \"james\"/> The studio announced that \"a more experienced director\" was needed as a result of an impending strike by the [[Directors Guild of America]]. On the short list of possible replacements were [[Ulu Grosbard]], [[Bruce Beresford]], and [[James Bridges]].<ref name= \"james\"/> Bridges received a call on a Friday that the film was in trouble, read the novel that night, and flew to New York City on Sunday. He saw Chopra's footage and agreed to direct if he could start from scratch and hire [[Gordon Willis]] as his cinematographer.<ref name= \"james\"/>\n\nReflecting on her experience in a 2013 interview with Hidden Films, Chopra reiterated Cole's statements that her version reduced the drug-related content because of studio pressures. \"The film was produced right at the time of Nancy Reagan's 'Just Say No' [slogan] and I think the studios were scared shitless. I think the producers had a book they were sorry they were doing. Sydney said he didn't like the book, he didn't approve of it. So you get a mess, yeah.\" She is still angered by statements made in The New York Times Magazine article. \"What amazed me was, they were boasting that after I left, they were wearing a shirt with a shoe on it! They said that I spent a month doing nothing but filming Michael walking, which was so insane. I was flabbergasted that the producers would print a t-shirt to step on me. What kind of people are these?\"\n\nAccording to Chopra, these \"shoe leather\" scenes were shot in adherence to the studio's schedule. \"It was set up so that we would do all the exterior shots first. There was a concern about the trees. I don't remember what season it was, but if there were shots of Michael going from A to B, you try to do all his scenes on days with a lot of daylight.\"\n\nIn seven days, Bridges wrote a new draft bringing back the darker elements of the novel such as the main character's heavy drinking and drug abuse and replaced six actors, casting instead Jason Robards, John Houseman, Swoosie Kurtz, Frances Sternhagen, and Tracy Pollan, while keeping Sutherland and Dianne Wiest.<ref name= \"james\"/> The new cast members read the novel because there was no script at the time. Chopra had worked on the film for only a month, which Fox has described as \"a rehearsal period, though it wasn't meant to be.\"<ref name= \"james\"/> The strike forced the production to shoot in seven weeks and use McInerney's first draft, which Bridges liked the best.<ref name= \"godfrey\"/> Bridges worked on the script on weekends with McInerney, who was enlisted to help with revisions. The two agreed to share screenwriting credit but the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to give it to McInerney only.<ref name= \"james\"/>\n\nThe cocaine that Fox snorts in the film was a prop called milk sugar.<ref name= \"james\"/> The filmmakers shot two different endings\u2014one where Fox's character decides to start his life all over but is vague with what he specifically plans to do and an alternative one, to please the studio, where he has finished writing a novel to be called ''Bright Lights, Big City'' with a new girlfriend who is proud of what he has written.<ref name= \"james\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Bright Lights, Big City'' was released on April 1, 1988, in 1,196 theaters, and grossed [[USD]] $5.1 million during its opening weekend.
