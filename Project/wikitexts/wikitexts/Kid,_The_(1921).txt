Two thieves steal the car and leave the baby in an alley, where he is found by [[The Tramp]]. After some attempts to hand off the child on to various passers-by, he finds the note and his heart melts. He takes the boy home, names him John and adjusts his household furniture for him. Meanwhile, the Mother has a change of heart and returns for her baby; when she learns that the car has been stolen, she faints.\n\nFive years pass. The Kid and the Tramp live in the same tiny room; they have little money but much love. They support themselves in a minor scheme: the Kid throws stones to break windows so that the Tramp, working as a [[glazier]], can be paid to repair them. Meanwhile, the Mother has become a wealthy actress and does charity by giving presents to poor children. By chance, as she does so, the Mother and the Kid unknowingly cross paths.\n\nThe Kid later gets into a fight with another local boy as people in the area gather to watch the spectacle. The Kid wins, drawing the ire of the other boy's older brother, who attacks the Tramp as a result. The Mother breaks up the fight, but it starts again after she leaves and the Tramp keeps beating the \"Big Brother\" over the head with a brick between swings until he totters away.\n\nShortly afterward, the Mother advises the Tramp to call a doctor after the Kid falls ill. The doctor discovers that the Tramp is not the Kid's father and notifies authorities. Two men come to take the boy to an orphanage, but after a fight and a chase, the Tramp and the boy remain side by side. When the Mother comes back to see how the boy is doing she encounters the doctor, who shows her the note (which he had taken from the Tramp); she recognizes it as the one she left with her baby years ago.\n\nNow fugitives, the Tramp and the boy spend the night in a [[flophouse]]. Its proprietor learns of a $1,000 reward offered by the authorities and takes the Kid to the police station, while the Tramp is asleep. As the tearful Mother is reunited with her long-lost child, the Tramp searches frantically for the missing boy. Unsuccessful, he returns to the doorway of their humble lodgings, where he falls asleep, entering a \"Dreamland\" where his neighbors have turned into angels and devils. A policeman awakes him and drives him off to a mansion. There the door is opened by the Mother and the Kid, who jumps into the Tramp's arms, and he is welcomed in.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Chaplin The Kid edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] and [[Jackie Coogan]] in a publicity photo for ''The Kid'']]\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as [[The Tramp]]\n* [[Jackie Coogan]] as the Kid (\"John\")\n* [[Edna Purviance]] as the Woman (John's mother)\n* [[Carl Miller (actor)|Carl Miller]] as the Man (John's father)\n\n;Uncredited:\n* [[Tom Wilson (actor)|Tom Wilson]] as the Policeman\n* [[Henry Bergman]] as night shelter keeper/Professor Guido/fat neighborhood man/[[apostle Peter]]\n* [[Charles Reisner]] as neighborhood bully\n* [[Raymond Lee (child actor)|Raymond Lee]] as bully's little brother\n* [[Lita Grey]] as flirtatious angel in Dreamland scene\n* Jules Hanft as the country doctor\n* [[Frank Campeau]] as welfare officer<ref>Lochner, Jim (2018).

The advertisement from First National Pictures featured high praise from Chicago-based newspapers including this review from ''The Chicago Herald and Examiner:''<blockquote>\"''The Kid'' settles once and for all the question as to who is the greatest theatrical artist in the world. Chaplin does some of the finest, most delicately shaded acting you ever saw anywhere, and for every slapstick furore in it there is a classic, exquisite scene. His action are riotous, convulsive, irresistible. The gentlest grandmother will bust a midriff. He's the best Hamlet alive today. Jackie Coogan is the best child actor you ever saw. Women wept just to see him. ''The Kid'' is two fisted. It's right glove is packed with the pearls of tears, its left with the horseshoe of laughter. The picture is perfection. Six reels that seem like one; six reels that are funnier than the work of any other human being; six reels that are sadder and simpler than anything in pictures; six reels that will atone for anything the movies have ever done.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exhibitors Herald - Lantern: Search, Visualize & Explore the Media History Digital Library|url=https://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/exhibitorsherald12exhi_0603|access-date=2021-11-12|website=lantern.mediahist.org}}</ref></blockquote>A reviewer from ''Theatre Magazine'' glowingly wrote, \"[Chaplin's] new picture, ''The Kid'', certainly outdoes in humor and the special brand of Chaplin pathos anything this popular film star has yet produced. There are almost as many tears as laughs in the new First National release--which proves the contention that Chaplin as almost as good a tragedian as he is a comedian. ''The Kid'' may be counted as a screen masterpiece.\"\n\nThe reviewer for ''The New York Times'' had more of a mixed reception of the film writing, \"Charlie Chaplin is himself again - at his best, in some ways better than his previous best, and also, it is to be regretted, at his worst, only not with so much of his worst as has spoiled some of his earlier pictures.\" The reviewer praises the plot, the comedy, the characters, and the \"balance of sadness\" with Chaplin being \"more of a comedian than a clown,\" but writes that \"the blemish on ''The Kid'' is the same that has marred many of Chaplin's other pictures - vulgarity, or coarseness. There is only a little of it in the present work, just two scenes that will be found particularly offensive by some. They are funny. That cannot be denied. One laughs at them, but many try not to, and are provoked with themselves and Chaplin for their laughing. This is not good. The laugh that offends good taste doesn't win. And these scenes would never be missed from ''The Kid''. It has plenty of unadulterated fun to go far and long without them. Why can't Chaplin leave out such stuff? Why don't the exhibitors delete it?\"<ref>{{Cite news|date=1921-01-22|title=THE SCREEN|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/01/22/archives/the-screen.html|access-date=2021-11-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nChaplin biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]] writes of the legacy of Chaplin's ''The Kid'': \"''The Kid'' remains an important contribution to the art of film, not only because of Chaplin\u2019s innovative use of dramatic sequences within a feature-length comedy, but also because of the revelations ''The Kid'' provides about its creator.
