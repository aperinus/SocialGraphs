The third entry in his ''[[Six Moral Tales]]'' series, it is his first film in colour.\n\nSet on the south coast of France in August, it portrays the shifting relationships between four very different characters who, as in the comedies of [[Marivaux]], play games of love and chance. The girl, who seduces two of the men and is resisted by the third, is called the ''collectionneuse''.\n\nThe film won the [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize]] at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"berlinale 1967\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1967/03_preistr_ger_1967/03_Preistraeger_1967.html |title=Berlinale 1967: Prize Winners |accessdate=2010-02-27 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> It is often considered one of Rohmer's best films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/rohmereric.php |title=Eric Rohmer's Acclaimed Films |date=2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nOn a summer day at the house of Rodolphe, a rich friend, Adrien and his fianc\u00e9e part on strained terms. She has to go and work for five weeks in London, while he chooses to spend the time at a house Rodolphe has rented near St Tropez. Also there will be another old friend, Daniel, and the two men can just relax by reading and swimming.\n\nWhen he gets there, Daniel warns him that unfortunately there is a third occupant. This is Hayd\u00e9e, a sexy teenager who Rodolphe has bedded and who now brings a different boy back each night. He calls her a little ''collectionneuse'', a collector of men. The two friends unite in banning any more boys and gating her. After sulking a while, she turns her charms on Adrien. While he admits to her that he likes her greatly, he says his moral code will not allow him to sleep with her. When she does not desist, he tells her to seduce easier prey in the shape of Daniel. The two sleep together for a while, but the fastidious Daniel turns against her and, after insulting her, leaves.\n\nAdrien comforts the hurt girl and thinks of a new plan to interest her. He has brought with him a rare Chinese vase to deliver to a rich but crass American collector called Sam, who is struck by Hayd\u00e9e. Sam invites the two to his villa to have dinner and stay the night. Adrien agrees with Hayd\u00e9e that he will plead he has business in the morning and will leave her there to seduce Sam. Going back to fetch her next evening, Sam turns against Adrien and insults him while flirting with Hayd\u00e9e, who then accidentally(?) knocks over his precious new vase.\n\nThe two make their escape and, as they drive home, Adrien thinks she is good at heart and that now Daniel has gone he can spend the last week of his holiday in an enjoyable affair with her. Two men passing in an Italian sports car recognise Hayd\u00e9e, who jumps out to talk to them. When they invite her to join them in Italy, she takes her overnight bag out of Adrien's car. Adrien, after waiting a while, leaves her with them and returns to the empty villa alone.\n\nHe can now fulfil his aim of peacefully reading and swimming, but it is not what he wants any more. He picks up the phone to book a seat on the next plane to London.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Adrien\n* [[Hayd\u00e9e Politoff]] as Hayd\u00e9e\n* Daniel Pommereulle as Daniel\n* [[Alain Jouffroy]] as Writer\n* [[Mijanou Bardot|Mijanou]] as Carole\n* Annik Morice as Carole's friend\n* [[Dennis Berry (director)|Dennis Berry]] as Charlie\n* Seymour Hertzberg as Sam\n\n==Production==\nRohmer made the film with no budget and out of order while he waited for [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] to be available for ''[[My Night at Maud's]]'', and this structure possibly inspired the techniques and principles he and his cinematographer [[Nestor Almendros]] would return to in his later films: extensive rehearsal with the cast followed by very few takes; relying on natural light wherever possible, even for night scenes; \"spying\" fluid long shots to establish characters and their relationship together in a specific space.<ref name=\"Criterion Collection essays\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=346&eid=489&section=essay |title=Criterion Collection of Six Moral Tales essays booklet}}</ref> In his autobiography ''A Man with a Camera'', Almendros admits \"The film had to have a 'natural' look, whether we wanted it to or not, because we had only five [[photoflood]] lamps.\" They used so little film that in \"the laboratories they thought they were the rushes of a short (film).\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Almendros|1984}}</ref>\n\nThe character Sam was billed as Seymour Hertzberg but was in fact Eugene Archer, a former ''New York Times'' film reviewer. As well as providing the striking colour photography, N\u00e9stor Almendros appears in the film. The director and writer [[Donald Cammell]] had an uncredited role as well.\n\n== Reception ==\n''La Collectionneuse'' currently holds a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2001, [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]] of ''The Guardian'' included the film in his list of the top 100 movies of the 20th century. In [[J\u00f8rgen Leth]]'s 2003 film ''[[The Five Obstructions]]'',  the Danish director describes it as his favorite work by Rohmer, and he hired one of its stars, [[Patrick Bauchau]], to appear in ''The Five Obstructions''.\n\nIn 2012, [[Roger Ebert]] added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation \n|last=Almendros\n|first=Nestor\n|title=A Man With A Camera\n|year=1984\n|publisher=Farrar Straus & Giroux\n|others=Rachel Phillips Belash (translator)\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0061495}}\n* {{AllMovie title|98177}}\n* {{AlloCin\u00e9 title|421}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|la-collectionneuse}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/437-la-collectionneuse-marking-time ''La collectionneuse: Marking Time''], an essay by [[Phillip Lopate]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{\u00c9ric Rohmer}}\n{{Silver Bear for Jury Grand Prix}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Collectionneuse}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by \u00c9ric Rohmer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Barbet Schroeder]]\n[[Category:Films set in Saint-Tropez]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Saint-Tropez]]\n[[Category:French comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize winners]]\n[[Category:1960s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]"}]}}}}
