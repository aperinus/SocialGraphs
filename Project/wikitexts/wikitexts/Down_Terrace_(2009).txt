With the help of his wife Maggie, Bill decides to find the rat in his criminal organisation and a tale of recrimination, betrayal and murder ensues.\n\nMeanwhile, Karl grows increasingly edgy and uncomfortable with his dysfunctional family. When Karl's girlfriend Valda shows up visibly pregnant, he hosts a dinner for her to meet his parents that does not end well. Karl announces that they plan to get married, but his parents disapprove and demand that he get a paternity test.\n\nBill's employee Garvey tells Karl that Valda dated Garvey's brother for a while recently, which enrages Karl; Karl murders Garvey and enlists his uncle Eric's help in secretly burying the body. Worried about Garvey's unexplained disappearance and that a hitman, Pringle, might talk about a previous attempt on Garvey's life, Bill orders Eric to murder Pringle and his mother, leaving his three-year-old son fatherless.\n\nThe carnage attracts Jony, a London gangster, who tells Bill that the lack of subtlety and stability has put Karl and his family at risk; Maggie promises to rein in Bill. Eric himself is poisoned by his sister Maggie because she doubts his loyalty to the family's criminal organization. Karl, who suspects that his parents have murdered Eric, accuses them of making deals with the police after he hears a death-bed confession from Berman, their lawyer. Eventually, Valda talks Karl into murdering his parents: Karl shoots his father to death, and Valda lures his mother to an isolated farm and stabs her to death.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* Robin
