It is an adaptation of the [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished play]] ''[[Woyzeck]]'' by German dramatist [[Georg B\u00fcchner]].\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nFranz Woyzeck, a lowly soldier stationed in a mid-nineteenth century provincial [[German Empire|German]] town, is the father of an illegitimate child by his mistress Marie. Woyzeck earns extra money for his family by performing menial jobs for the Captain and agreeing to take part in medical experiments conducted by the Doctor. As one of these experiments, the Doctor tells Woyzeck he must eat nothing but peas. Woyzeck's mental health is breaking down and he begins to experience a series of apocalyptic visions. Meanwhile, Marie grows tired of Woyzeck and turns her attentions to a handsome [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] who, in an ambiguous scene taking place in Marie's bedroom, sleeps with her.\n\nAfter some time, and with his jealous suspicions growing, Woyzeck confronts the drum major, who beats him up and humiliates him. Finally and at the verge of [[mental breakdown]], Woyzeck stabs Marie to death by a pond. Woyzeck disposes of the knife in the pond, and while trying to wash the blood off, he hallucinates that he is swimming in blood and apparently drowns himself and dies. While recovering the corpses, the townspeople relish the fact that \"a real murder\" has taken place, distracting everyone from their mind-numbingly boring lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Klaus Kinski]] as Friedrich Johann Franz Woyzeck\n* [[Eva Mattes]] as Marie\n* [[Wolfgang Reichmann]] as Captain\n* [[Willy Semmelrogge]] as Doctor\n* [[Josef Bierbichler]] as Drum Major\n* [[Paul Burian]] as Andres\n* [[Volker Prechtel]] as Handwerksbursche\n* [[Dieter Augustin]] as Marktschreier\n* [[Irm Hermann]] as Margret\n* [[Wolfgang B\u00e4chler]] as Jew\n\n==Production==\nFilming for ''Woyzeck'' in [[Tel\u010d]], [[Czechoslovakia]], began just five days after work on Herzog's ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' had ended.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Herzog used the same exhausted crew and star. The scenes were accomplished mostly in a single take, which allowed the filming to be completed in only 18 days; it was edited in just four. Herzog had planned to use [[Bruno S.]] in the title role, but he then changed his mind, considering Kinski more suitable for the part. To compensate Bruno for this disappointment, Herzog wrote the leading role in the film ''[[Stroszek]]'' especially for him.{{Citation needed|reason=Stroszek had already been filmed & released, unless the decision to use Kinski in Woyzeck was way back in 1976 I don't see how Herzog could have written the role for Bruno S as compensation.|date=April 2018}}\n\nAt the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]], [[Eva Mattes]] won the award for Best Supporting Actress for her part in this film. Herzog was nominated for the [[Golden Palm]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1889/year/1979.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Woyzeck |access-date=2009-05-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> In 1981, the film won the Silver Guild Film Award from the [[Guild of German Art House Cinemas]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Awards for Woyzeck\n | publisher =[[Internet Movie Database]]\n | url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080149/awards\n | access-date =2007-12-25 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Woyzeck'' has an 85% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of 7.3/10 based on 13 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Woyzeck (1979)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/woyzeck_1979|language=en|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref> In an episode of [[Sneak Previews]] both [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] recommended the film.<ref>Sneak Previews Season 2 Episode 13 |url=https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1736096537?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_1</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n* The music during the opening scene before the credits is Beethoven Piano Sonata Op. 81a, Second Movement (\"Abwesenheit\" or \"Absence\") performed on a [[Celesta|celeste]].\n* The opening credits strings music is performed by the Fidelquartett Tel\u010d, which also performs live during the movie.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woyzeck film data |url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/main/de/html/films/films_details/general.php?film_id=21 |website=wernerherzog.com film database |access-date=12 November 2018}}</ref> The performance seems to have been created for the movie since no further reference is available.\n* The last song of the closing credits is the second movement (largo) of [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s concerto for lute and two violins in D major (RV93), played with the guitar.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0080149|Woyzeck}}\n* {{Amg movie|55551|Woyzeck}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|woyzeck_1979|Woyzeck}}\n\n{{Werner Herzog}}\n{{Woyzeck}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1979 drama films]]\n[[Category:German drama films]]\n[[Category:West German films]]\n[[Category:1970s German-language films]]\n[[Category:German films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Werner Herzog]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1830s]]\n[[Category:Works based on Woyzeck]]\n[[Category:1970s German films]]"}]}}}}
