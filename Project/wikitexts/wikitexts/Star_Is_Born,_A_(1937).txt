Selznick]], directed by [[William A. Wellman]] from a script by Wellman, [[Robert Carson (writer)|Robert Carson]], [[Dorothy Parker]], and [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]], and starring [[Janet Gaynor]] (in her only Technicolor film) as an aspiring [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] actress, and [[Fredric March]] (in his Technicolor debut) as a fading [[movie star]] who helps launch her career. The supporting cast features [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[May Robson]], [[Andy Devine]], [[Lionel Stander]], and [[Owen Moore]].\n\nThe film has been remade three times: in [[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|1954]] (directed by [[George Cukor]] and starring [[Judy Garland]] and [[James Mason]]), in [[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|1976]] (directed by [[Frank Pierson]] and starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]), and in [[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|2018]] (starring [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Bradley Cooper]], who also directed).\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Janet Gaynor in A Star is Born.jpg|left|thumb|{{center|[[Janet Gaynor]]}}]]\n\n[[North Dakota]] farm girl Esther Victoria Blodgett yearns to become a Hollywood actress.  Although her aunt and father discourage such thoughts, Esther's grandmother gives Esther her savings to follow her dream.\n\nEsther goes to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and tries to land a job as an extra, but so many others have had the same idea that the casting agency has stopped accepting applications. Esther is told that her chances of becoming a star are one in 100,000. She befriends a new resident at her boarding house, assistant director Danny McGuire, himself out of work. When Danny and Esther go to a concert to celebrate Danny's employment, Esther has her first encounter with Norman Maine, an actor she admires greatly. Norman has been a major star for years, but his alcoholism has sent his career into a downward spiral.\n\nDanny gets Esther a one-time waitressing job at a fancy Hollywood party. While serving hors d'\u0153uvres, she catches Norman's eye. The next day, he gets his longtime producer and good friend, Oliver Niles, to give her a screen test. Impressed, Oliver gives her a contract and a new name, \"Vicki Lester\". She practices her few lines for her first tiny role.\n\nWhen the studio has trouble finding a female lead for Norman's current film, entitled ''The Enchanted Hour,'' Norman persuades Oliver to cast Esther. The film makes her an overnight success, even as cinemagoers and exhibitors continue to lose interest in Norman.\n\nNorman proposes to Esther; she accepts when he promises to give up drinking. They elope without publicity, much to press agent Matt Libby's disgust, and enjoy a trailer-camping honeymoon in the mountains. When they return, Esther's popularity continues to skyrocket, while Norman realizes that his own career is over, despite Oliver's attempts to help him.\n\nNorman stays sober for a while, but his frustration over his situation finally pushes him over the edge, and he starts drinking again. When Esther wins the industry's top award (the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]), he interrupts her acceptance speech by drunkenly demanding three awards for the ''worst'' acting of the year and accidentally slapping her when he dramatically swings his arms back.\n\nA stay at a sanatorium seems to cure Norman's increasingly disruptive alcoholism, but a chance encounter with Libby allows the press agent to vent his long-concealed contempt. Norman goes on a four-day drinking binge and winds up arrested for drunk driving. In court, the judge sentences him to 90 days of incarceration, but Esther pleads with the judge to put Norman under her care. The judge, who is impressed with Esther's acting success, suspends Norman's sentence and puts Norman's custody into Esther's hands. Esther decides to give up her career to devote herself to his rehabilitation. After Norman overhears her discussing her plan with Oliver, he drowns himself in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nShattered, Esther decides to quit and go home. Showing up soon afterward is her grandmother, who has heard that Esther is quitting. Her grandmother tells her of a letter Norman sent her when they got married. The letter stated how proud he was of Esther and how much he loved her. Because of her grandmother's words and the reminder of Norman's deep love, Esther is convinced to stay in show business. At the premiere of her next film at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], when Esther is asked to say a few words into the microphone to her many fans listening across the world, she announces, \"Hello, everybody. This is Mrs. Norman Maine.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Fredric March-Janet Gaynor in A Star Is Born (1937).jpg|thumb|right|March and Gaynor]]\n{{castlist|* [[Janet Gaynor]] as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester\n* [[Fredric March]] as Norman Maine\n* [[Adolphe Menjou]] as Oliver Niles\n* [[May Robson]] as Grandmother Lettie Blodgett\n* [[Andy Devine]] as Daniel \"Danny\" McGuire\n* [[Lionel Stander]] as Matt Libby\n* [[Owen Moore]] as Casey Burke\n* [[Peggy Wood]] as Miss Phillips\n* [[Elizabeth Jenns (actress)|Elizabeth Jenns]] as Anita Regis\n* [[Edgar Kennedy]] as Pop Randall\n* [[J.

When she first saw the film, Parker was proud of her contribution and boasted about both the script and the film, but in later life she believed that she had contributed nothing of significance.<ref name=Meade/> Early in their careers, [[Budd Schulberg]] (then a [[Script coverage|script reader]] for [[David O. Selznick]]) and [[Ring Lardner, Jr.]] (who was working in Selznick's [[publicity]] department) were assigned to write some additional dialogue for the film, a collaboration which produced [[Janet Gaynor]]'s (and the film's) final words: \"This is Mrs. Norman Maine.\" The line was used again in the 1954 [[Warner Bros.]] [[musical film|musical]] [[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|remake]] starring [[Judy Garland]] and [[James Mason]].<ref name=cdlib/> [[George Cukor]], who directed the remake, suggested adding the scene in the 1937 film in which Menjou offers the fading star a supporting role.\n\nJanet Gaynor was given the first Oscar for Best Actress at the first Academy Awards ceremony on May 16, 1929. In the scene in which Vicky Lester wins an Oscar, it is Janet Gaynor's very own Oscar she is holding. In a subsequent scene, the same Oscar is seen sitting on a shelf. Fredric March Had won the Oscar for Best Actor (1931/32) on November 18, 1932 for the film ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (he tied with [[Wallace Beery]] for [[The Champ (1931 film)|''The Champ'' (1931 film)]]). Although Norman Maine states that he won an award statue, and the name \"Oscar\" is never mentioned on screen, it is, presumably, an Oscar. Unlike Janet Gaynor, however, Fredric March's real Oscar is never seen.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Adolphe Menjou in A Star is Born.jpg\n| width1 = 171\n| caption1 = [[Adolphe Menjou]] (left) &nbsp; &nbsp; and\n| image2 = Andy Devine in A Star is Born.jpg\n| width2 = 167\n| caption2 = [[Andy Devine]] (right) from the film's trailer\n| total_width =\n| alt1 =\n}}\n\n==Background==\nSome film historians believe that the marriage of [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]] was the film's real-life inspiration. [[John Bowers (actor)|John Bowers]] has also been identified as inspiration for the Norman Maine character and the dramatic suicide-by-drowning scene near the end of the film (Bowers drowned in November 1936). The film contains several inside jokes, including Gaynor's brief imitations of [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], and [[Mae West]]; the \"Crawford Smear\", referring to [[Joan Crawford]]'s lipstick; and the revelation that the glamorous Norman Maine's real last name is Hinkle. (Henkel was the real last name of silent film star [[Agnes Ayres]], and not far removed from Fredric March's real last name, Bickel.)\n\nThis film also has many similarities to the earlier film ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932), released by [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. The 1932 film's original title was ''The Truth About Hollywood'' based on a story by [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]]. St. Johns loosely based her plot on the experiences of actress [[Colleen Moore]] and her husband, alcoholic producer [[John McCormick (producer)|John McCormick]] (1893\u20131961), and the life and death of director [[Tom Forman (actor)|Tom Forman]], who committed suicide following a [[nervous breakdown]].<ref name=TVGuide/>\n\nFour years after ''What Price Hollywood?'' was released, Selznick approached [[George Cukor]] and asked him to direct ''A Star Is Born''. Cukor felt the plot was too similar to ''What Price Hollywood?'' so he declined. RKO executives considered filing a plagiarism suit against [[Selznick International Pictures]] because of the similarities in the story, but eventually chose not to take legal action. Cukor later directed the [[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|1954 musical remake]] starring [[Judy Garland]].<ref name=McGilligan/><ref name=Levy/>\n\nA common Hollywood myth about the film is that [[Lana Turner]] appeared as an extra in one of the scenes in the film. Turner often denied the myth over the years, mentioning that she was discovered several months after the picture had finished production.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe title theme, \"A Star is Born\", was recorded by [[Buddy Clark]] with the orchestra of [[Eddy Duchin]]. The lyrics were written by Dorothy Dick to the music of [[Max Steiner]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n[[File:FredricMarchinAStarIsBorn1937.jpg|left|thumb|March in the trailer]]\nContemporary reviews were very positive.
