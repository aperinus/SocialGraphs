It follows a fictional playwright, Nicky Rogan, who has a new stage play opening on the same day the sixth game of the [[1986 World Series]] is played. It realizes a 1991 screenplay by [[Don DeLillo]], with a soundtrack written and performed by [[Yo La Tengo]]. The supporting cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Griffin Dunne]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]].\n\n==Plot==\nNicky Rogan has written several plays and has achieved success.  It's now opening night of his latest effort and everyone around him assure him that this one will be the best yet. But as opening hour approaches, Rogan falls prey to doubts and fears, egged on by another playwright whose last work was trashed by the local newspaper's new drama critic, Steven Schwimmer. He eventually lets those fears drive him to resolve to kill the critic (who he assumes will also trash his play) and he procures a handgun with which to perform the deed.\n\nInstead of attending the play's opening night, Rogan spends time in a bar, accompanied by a lady [[Taxicab|cab driver]] and her grandson; earlier in the evening she misidentified Rogan as a local, small-time hoodlum but he doesn't correct her misidentification.\n\nThey watch the crucial Game 6 of the [[1986 World Series]] between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[New York Mets]]. The Sox have won 3 games and could clinch the title by winning Game 6 but Rogan, a lifelong Sox fan, knows how easily the team can lose when they should win. He spends the evening waiting for the inevitable, even though the Sox are leading most of the time. When the inevitable does occur (due to an unexpected pair of errors at the end of the final inning), he snaps and leaves to take out his rage on the newspaper critic.\n\nRogan not only finds the critic but sees him in the early stages of deflowering the playwright's daughter. He begins firing wildly and is finally calmed when he learns the critic is equally devastated by the Sox's loss.  They end up together, watching an interminable rerun of the final error by [[Bill Buckner]] on a small television set in the critic's apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Nicky Rogan\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Steven Schwimmer\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as Laurel Rogan\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Joanna Bourne\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Elliott Litvak\n* [[Shalom Harlow]] as Paisley Porter\n* [[Nadia Dajani]] as Renee Simons\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Peter Redmond\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Jack Haskins\n* [[Tom Aldredge]] as Michael Rogan\n* [[Lillias White]] as Toyota Moseby\n* Amir Ali Said as Matthew\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Lillian Rogan\n* Rock Kohli as Ramaswamy Choudhry\n* John Tormey as George, Georgie, Giorgio\n* [[Harry Bugin]] as Dodgie\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made as an independent effort, largely as a labor of love, with all the \"name\" players working for little more than scale (Keaton's salary was $100/day, for instance).  Filming was completed in 20 days, and the filming budget was $500,000.  Most of the filming occurred in [[New York City]].\n\n== Reception ==\n{{As of|2022|02}}, the film holds a 60% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Though packed with Don DeLillo's witty dialogue and bolstered by strong performances, particularly by lead Michael Keaton, ''Game 6'' also suffers from uneven direction and overwrought symbolism.\"<ref>{{cite web |title = Game 6 (2005) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/game_six/ |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date = 2022-02-22 }}</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as \"a writer\u2019s film if there ever was one\u201d.<ref>Maltin, Leonard (2009), p. 511.
