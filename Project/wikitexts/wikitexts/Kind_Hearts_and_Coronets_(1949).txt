It concerns Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, the son of a woman disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying out of her social class. After her death, Louis decides to take revenge on the family and take the [[duke]]dom by murdering the eight people ahead of him in the line of succession to the title.\n\n[[Michael Balcon]], the head of [[Ealing Studios]] and the producer of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets'', appointed [[Robert Hamer]] as director. Hamer  thought it an interesting project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way. Filming took place from September 1948 at [[Leeds Castle]] and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.\n\n''Kind Hearts and Coronets'' was released on 13 June 1949 in the United Kingdom, and was well received by the critics. It has continued to receive favourable reviews over the years and, in 1999, it was number six in the [[British Film Institute]]'s rating of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. In 2005, it was included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s list of the top 100 films since 1923.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] [[England]], Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, is in prison, awaiting his [[hanging]] for murder the following morning. As he writes his memoirs, the events of his life are shown in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nHis mother, the youngest daughter of the 7th Duke of Chalfont, eloped with an Italian opera singer named Mazzini and was disowned by her family for marrying beneath her station. The Mazzinis were poor but happy until Mazzini died shortly after Louis, his son, had been born. In the aftermath, Louis's widowed mother raises him on the history of her family and tells him how, unlike most other [[peerage]]s, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female heirs. Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.\n\nWhen Louis leaves school, his mother writes to her kinsman Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a [[private bank]]er, for assistance in launching her son in a career, but is rebuffed. Louis is forced to work as an assistant in a draper's shop. When his mother dies, her last request, to be interred in the family [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]] at Chalfont Castle, is denied. Louis proposes marriage to Sibella, but she ridicules his proposal, and instead, marries Lionel Holland, a former school friend of her brother who has a rich father. Soon after this, in the draper's shop Louis quarrels with a customer, Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker's only child, who has him dismissed from his job.\n\nLouis resolves to kill Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and the other seven people ahead of him in succession to the dukedom. After arranging a fatal boating accident for Ascoyne D'Ascoyne and his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], Louis writes a letter of condolence to his victim's father, Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, who employs him as a clerk. Upon his later promotion, Louis takes a [[bachelor pad|bachelor flat]] in [[St James's]], London, for assignations with Sibella.\n\nLouis next targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is charmed by his wife, Edith. He substitutes petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's [[darkroom]], with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is fit to be his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne is the next victim. Posing as the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] Bishop of [[Matabeleland]], Louis poisons Lord Henry\u2019s after-dinner [[port (wine)|port]]. From the window of his flat, Louis then uses a bow and arrow to shoot down the [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]] from which the [[suffragette]] Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of [[caviar]] which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, by chance he conveniently insists on [[Captain goes down with the ship|going down with his ship]] after causing a collision at sea.\n\nWhen Edith agrees to marry Louis, they notify Ethelred, the childless, widowed 8th duke. He invites them to spend a few days at Chalfont Castle. When Ethelred casually informs Louis that he intends to remarry in order to produce an heir, Louis arranges a hunting \"accident\". Before murdering the duke, he reveals his motive. Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne dies from the shock of learning that he has become the ninth duke, sparing Louis from having to murder his kindly employer. Louis inherits the dukedom and its estates, but his triumph proves short-lived.\n\nSibella's husband, Lionel, makes a drunken plea to Louis for financial help to avoid bankruptcy, but is turned down flat. Lionel is then found dead, and a [[Scotland Yard]] detective arrests Louis on suspicion of having murdered him. Louis elects to be [[Privilege of peerage#Trial by peers|tried by his peers]] in the [[House of Lords]].  During the trial, Louis and Edith are married. Sibella falsely testifies that Lionel was about to seek a divorce and name Louis as [[co-respondent]]. Ironically, Louis is convicted of a murder he had never even contemplated.\n\nLouis is visited by Sibella, who observes that the discovery of Lionel's [[suicide note]] and Edith's death would free Louis and enable them to marry, a proposal to which he agrees. Moments before his hanging, the discovery of the note saves him. Louis finds both Edith and Sibella waiting for him outside the prison. When a reporter tells him that ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine wishes to publish his memoirs, Louis suddenly remembers that he has left the incriminating document behind in his cell.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Dennis Price]] as Louis Mazzini and his father\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as eight members of the D'Ascoyne family:\n: Ethelred, 8th Duke of Chalfont\n: The Reverend Lord Henry\n: General Lord Rufus\n: Admiral Lord Horatio\n: Lord Ascoyne, Banker\n: Young Ascoyne, the banker's son\n: Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne\n: Henry, photographer\n* [[Valerie Hobson]] as Edith\n* [[Joan Greenwood]] as Sibella\n* [[Audrey Fildes]] as Mama\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as the hangman\n* [[Clive Morton]] as the prison governor\n* [[John Penrose (actor)|John Penrose]] as Lionel\n* [[Cecil Ramage]] as the prosecution barrister\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as the [[Lord High Steward]], who presides over Louis's trial\n* [[John Salew]] as Mr Perkins\n* Eric Messiter as Inspector Burgoyne of [[Scotland Yard]]\n* Lyn Evans as the farmer\n* Barbara Leake as the schoolmistress\n* [[Peggy Ann Clifford]] as Maud Redpole\n* [[Anne Valery]] as the Girl in the punt\n* [[Arthur Lowe]] as the ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' reporter\n* [[Richard Wattis]] as the defence barrister (uncredited)\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] Warder in Jail (uncredited)\n* [[Jeremy Spenser]] as Louis as a child (uncredited)\n* [[Carol White]] as Sibella as a child (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[File:Sir Alec Guinness 3 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alec Guinness]] in 1972]]\nIn 1947 [[Michael Pertwee]], a scriptwriter at [[Ealing Studios]], suggested an adaptation of a 1907 [[Roy Horniman]] novel, ''Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal''.{{sfn|Sellers|2015|pp=152\u2013153}} The writer [[Simon Heffer]] observes that the plot of the source novel was dark in places\u2014it includes the murder of a child\u2014and differed in several respects from the resulting film. A major difference was that the main character was the half-Jewish (as opposed to half-Italian) Israel Rank, and Heffer writes that Mazzini's \"ruthless using of people (notably women) and his greedy pursuit of position all seem to conform to the stereotype that the [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semite]] has of the Jew\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Heffer |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Heffer |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/article/2008/12/simon-heffer-on-israel-rank/ |url-status=dead |title=Israel Rank Reviewed |work=[[Faber and Faber]] |access-date=25 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901215515/http://www.faber.co.uk/article/2008/12/simon-heffer-on-israel-rank/ |archive-date=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe change from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini was brought about by the \"post-war sensitivity about anti-Semitism\", and the moral stance of the films produced by Ealing.{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=35}} According to the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI), the novel is \"self-consciously in the tradition\" of [[Oscar Wilde]], which is reflected in the [[snobbery]] and [[dandyism]] portrayed in the film.{{sfn|Duguid|Freeman|Johnston|Williams|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe head of Ealing Studios, [[Michael Balcon]], was initially unconvinced by the idea of the film, stating that \"I'm not going to make a comedy about eight murders\"; the studio's creative staff persuaded him to reconsider.{{sfn|Mackillop|Sinyard|2003|p=75}} Balcon, who produced the film, chose [[Robert Hamer]] as director and warned him that \"You are trying to sell that most unsaleable commodity to the British \u2013 irony.

Firstly, in that of making a film not noticeably similar to any previously made in the English language. Secondly, that of using this English language&nbsp;... in a more varied and, to me, more interesting way than I had previously had the chance of doing in a film. Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.{{sfn|Newton|2003|p=7}}</blockquote>\n\nThe film was produced at the same time as two other [[Ealing comedies]], ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'' and ''[[Whisky Galore!

When employed as a shop assistant, Louis's suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a [[brocade]] dressing gown and waiting for his execution in a quilted-collar velvet jacket.

Guinness agreed, telling Hamer that as he practised [[yoga]], he could hold his breath for four minutes. Guinness was attached to the deck by wires to keep him steady and the shot was taken; when Hamer called \"cut\", the crew began packing up and forgot to release Guinness until four minutes after the scene ended.{{sfn|Sellers|2015|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Leeds Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1217205.jpg|thumb|[[Leeds Castle]], which served as the ancestral home of the D'Ascoyne family.]]\nThe [[British Film Institute]] see ''Kind Hearts and Coronets'' as \"less sentimental\" than many of the other Ealing films.
