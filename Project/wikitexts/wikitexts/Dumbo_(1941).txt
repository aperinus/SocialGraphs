He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of [[flight|flying]] by using his ears as [[wing]]s. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy \u2013 a relationship parodying the [[Fear of mice#Elephants and mice|stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants]].\n\nMade to recoup the financial losses of both ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', ''Dumbo'' was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studios. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. Sound was recorded conventionally using the [[RCA Photophone|RCA]] System. One voice was synthesized using the [[Sonovox]] system, but it, too, was recorded using the RCA System.\n\n''Dumbo'' was released on October 23, 1941, where it was met with generally favorable reviews.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=176}} However, it has also been criticized for [[Stereotypes of African Americans|racist stereotyping of black people]]. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|agency=Library of Congress|date=December 13, 2017|access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA [[Dumbo (2019 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the film directed by [[Tim Burton]] was released on March 29, 2019, though it was neither critically nor commercially successful.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. This article is currently at 546.-->\n\nWhile a large circus spends the off-season in the \"Winter Grounds\" in [[Florida]], a flock of white [[stork#In fiction|storks]] delivers babies to the animals. One elephant, Mrs. Jumbo, does not receive her baby, and keeps scanning the sky. The circus sets out on a new tour, and a belated stork catches up with the moving train and drops off the expected baby elephant, Jumbo Junior. The other elephants are initially delighted, until they see the baby has far-oversized ears, and promptly nickname him \"Dumbo\". However, Mrs. Jumbo shows her baby great care and love, defending him from the teasing of the other elephants.\n\nDumbo, clumsy due to his ears, is made into a [[sideshow]] attraction. When some rowdy boys started to [[bullying|bully]] Dumbo and his ears, Mrs. Jumbo [[spanking|spanks]] their leader and throws hay bales at them. Circus staff remove Dumbo from the pen, and Mrs. Jumbo flies into a rage, eventually dousing the [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] in a water tub. She is subsequently deemed mad and locked in a cage. Dumbo is blamed for the incident and shunned by the other elephants.\n\nTimothy, a mouse that travels with the circus, befriends Dumbo and decides to make him a star. He whispers in the ringmaster's ear while the latter sleeps, and convinces him to try a new stunt with Dumbo as the top of a pyramid of elephants. However, Dumbo trips on his ears during the show and knocks over the pyramid, injuring the other elephants and bringing the [[wikt:big top|big top]] crashing down. After this, the other elephants exile Dumbo completely, and he is put in with the clowns' firemen act, regularly jumping from a \"burning building\" prop into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity, he hates the job and becomes depressed.\n\nTimothy decides to take Dumbo to see Mrs. Jumbo, but they cannot see each other's faces and can only intertwine trunks. Meanwhile, the clowns decide to increase the popularity of their fireman act by dangerously raising the platform Dumbo jumps from. In celebration of the plan, they drink [[champagne]], and a bottle of it falls into a water vat. Dumbo, crying after visiting his mother, gets the [[hiccups]], so Timothy takes him to the vat for water. Both of them get drunk, and [[hallucinate]] pink elephants.\n\nDumbo and Timothy are later discovered asleep high up in a tree by Dandy Crow and his friends. Initially making fun of Timothy's assertion that Dumbo flew with his ears while drunk, the crows are soon moved by Dumbo's sad story. They decide to help Timothy, giving him a \"magic feather\" to help Dumbo fly. Holding the feather, Dumbo does indeed take off a second time, and he and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience.\n\nDuring the clowns' act, Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly. He drops the feather, but Timothy assures him it was only a psychological aid, and Dumbo successfully flies about the big top, much to the delight of the public. Dumbo gains fame and fortune, Timothy becomes his new manager and signs him to a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] contract, and Mrs. Jumbo is freed. She and Dumbo are given a private coach on the train, and the crows wave goodbye to the elephants as they travel away.\n\n==Voice cast==\nThe voice actors are uncredited for their roles in the film.\n* The [[title role|title character]] is Dumbo, the nickname given to Jumbo Jr. He is an elephant who has huge ears and is able to use them to fly, carrying what he thinks of as a magic feather. Like Dopey in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Gideon in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', and Tootles in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', Dumbo does not have a word of [[dialogue|spoken dialogue]].\n* [[Edward Brophy]] as Timothy Q. Mouse, an [[anthropomorphic]] mouse who becomes the only friend of Dumbo, along with the crows, after his mother is locked up and does his best to make Dumbo happy again. He teaches Dumbo how to become the \"ninth wonder of the universe\", and the only flying elephant in the world. He is never mentioned by name in the film, but his signature can be read on the contract in a newspaper photograph at the finale.\n* [[Verna Felton]] as Elephant Matriarch, the well-meaning but pompous leader of the elephants who is initially cold toward Dumbo. Felton also voices Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo's mother, who speaks only once in the film to give Dumbo's name.\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Dandy Crow (previously named [[Jim Crow]] on the original model sheets), the leader of a group of crows. Though he initially jokes and ridicules Timothy's idea that Dumbo can fly, he hears Dumbo's tragic history and becomes determined to help Dumbo fly for real. He is never mentioned by name in the film.\n* [[Herman Bing]] as The Ringmaster, who, though not truly evil, is a strict, greedy, and arrogant man who exploits workers and animals. The Ringmaster later appears as an outright villain in the video game ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''.\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as Mr. Stork, Dumbo's carrier stork seen at the beginning of the film.\n* Margaret Wright as Casey Junior, the sentient [[2-4-0]] [[tender (rail)|tender locomotive]] hauling the circus train.\n* The Hall Johnson Choir as Crow Chorus\n** [[Hall Johnson]] as Deacon Crow\n** [[James Baskett]] as Fats Crow\n** [[Nick Stewart]] as Specks Crow\n** Jim Carmichael as Dopey Crow\n* The King's Men as Roustabout Chorus\n* Noreen Gammill as Elephant Catty\n* Dorothy Scott as Elephant Giddy\n* Sarah Selby as Elephant Prissy\n* [[Billy Bletcher]] as Clown\n* Malcolm Hutton as Smitty\n* John McLeish as the narrator\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Dumbo'' is based upon a children's story written by [[Helen Aberson-Mayer]] and Harold Pearl,<ref name=\"pace\"/> with illustrations by Helen Durney.<ref name=\"hrdpapers\">{{cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/d/durney_hr.htm|title=Helen R.

With the film's modest budget, ''Dumbo'' was intended to be a low-budget feature designed to bring revenue to the studio.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=176}} Story artists [[Dick Huemer]] and [[Joe Grant]] were assigned to develop the plot into a feature-length film. From January 22 to March 21, 1940, they wrote a 102-page script outline in chapters, much like a book, an unusual way of writing a film script. They conceived the stork-delivery and the pink elephants sequences and had Dumbo's mother renamed from \"Mother Ella\" to \"Mrs. Jumbo\". They riffed on elephants' fear of mice by replacing a wise [[American robin|robin]] named \"Red\" found in the original story with the wisecracking mouse character, Timothy. They also added a \"rusty black crow\", which was later expanded into five.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Canemaker |title=Two Guys Named Joe |page=149 |publisher=Disney Editions |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-423-11067-5}}</ref> Regardless of this, very little was changed from the original draft.<ref name=\"TakingFlight\">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/GbgvitYr4To Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20210823023901/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbgvitYr4To Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media notes |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbgvitYr4To |title=Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo |type=Bonus feature |publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment |year=2011 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In March 1940, a story team headed by Otto Englander translated the outline into story sketches.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=273}}\n\n===Animation===\nFrom Disney's perspective, ''Dumbo'' required none of the special effects that had slowed down production and grew the budgets of ''Pinocchio'', ''Fantasia'', and ''Bambi''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|page=272}} When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|page=333}} As a result, the character designs are simpler, background paintings are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the [[traditional animation|character animation]]. Although the film is more \"cartoony\" than previous Disney films, the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement.<ref name=\"John Canemaker\" />\n\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolor paint]] was used to render the backgrounds. ''Dumbo'' is one of the few Disney features to use the technique, which was also used for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', and regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used [[oil paint]] and [[gouache]]. 2002's ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', which drew influences from ''Dumbo'', [[Lilo & Stitch#Design and animation|also made use of watercolor backgrounds]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/19/a-look-inside-the-creation-of-lilo-and-stitch|title=A Look Inside the Creation of Lilo and Stitch|work=IGN|date=June 19, 2002|access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Disney animators' strike====\n{{main|Disney animators' strike}}\nDuring a story meeting for ''Bambi'' on February 27, 1940, Disney observed that ''Dumbo'' was \"an obvious straight cartoon\" and that the animators that were assigned on ''Bambi'' were not appropriate for the look of ''Dumbo''. Animators such as [[Art Babbitt]] and [[Ward Kimball]] were considered for the film.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|page=272}} For that reason, less experienced animators were brought on to animate the characters. Kimball recalled that Disney approached him in a parking lot about ''Dumbo'' and summarized the entire story in five minutes. \"And listening to him tell that story,\" Kimball noted, \"I could tell that the picture was going to work. Because everything sounded right. It had a great plot.\" In spite of this, [[Bill Tytla]], who was one of the studio's top animators, animated the title character, but admitted that \"it was in the nature of the film to go very fast and get it out in a hurry.\" To speed up production, Disney used photostats of story sketches instead of full layout artwork for the film, and had experienced animators to supervise the younger, less experienced animators assigned on the film.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pages=333\u2013334}}\n\nProduction on the film was interrupted on May 29, 1941 when much of the Disney animation staff went on strike. Kimball chose to not to strike, but his close friend [[Walt Kelly]], who was an assistant animator helping him on the crow sequence, left the studios shortly after for reasons unrelated to the strike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Canemaker|first=John|title=Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation|chapter=Ward Kimball|pages=104\u2013105|year=2001|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=978-0-786-86496-6}}</ref>\n\nThe clowns' requests to get a raise from their boss is a reference to the Disney animators that went on strike in 1941 (during the creation of the film), demanding higher pay from Walt himself. Moreover, the clowns, or at least their [[silhouette]]s, are caricatures of those animators.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lowry |first=Sam |title=The Disney cartoonists strike, 1941 |url=http://libcom.org/history/1941-disney-cartoonists-strike |website=Libcom |access-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Frank Churchill]] and [[Oliver Wallace]] scored the film while [[Ned Washington]] wrote the lyrics to the songs.
