Filled with remorse, Mitch looks at a photograph of his daughter Katherine as they drive down a nameless highway. Out in the desert, Mitch sees the creatures stalking them but does not tell Jack. In desperation, the pair pulls up to a run-down gas station. Inside, the men witness strange events as the creatures stalk them from afar. As Mitch and Jack attempt to escape, they pull up to the same gas station further down the road. Jack tries to leave as the creatures close in on the pair, and is killed. Mitch, believing that this is the fate he deserves, refuses to leave and instead follows the creatures to a nearby motel. He enters room 6255 and finds himself in a home that he finds familiar. Hearing his daughter's voice, Mitch follows the sounds and finds an apparition of his daughter Katherine, who begs for his help. As he moves closer to his daughter, however, she continues to run away. Mitch is trapped in the hallway of the house, tormented until death by the regret that he was not able to help his daughter.\n\n===Siren===\n* Directed by [[Roxanne Benjamin]]\n* Written by Roxanne Benjamin & Susan Burke\n\nAt the same motel are Sadie ([[Fabianne Therese]]), Ava ([[Hannah Marks]]), and Kim (Nathalie Love), traveling musicians in a band called The White Tights. Leaving the motel, visiting landmarks, stalked by the floating creatures, their van's tire goes flat and they are forced to pull over. Stranded in the middle of the desert, they are picked up by a friendly, eccentric couple ([[Susan Theresa Burke|Susan Burke]] and Davey Johnson). In the backseat of their car, Sadie sees a bear trap. The band is taken to the couple's house further down the road. Inside, the band is shown to their room; Sadie hears the woman mention their late friend Alex, but neither Ava nor Kim seem to notice. At dinner with the Kensingtons ([[Anessa Ramsey]] and [[Dana Gould]]), who live nearby with twin sons, they are served a meal of burnt [[roast beef]]; Sadie, a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], politely declines. After dinner, Kim begins to blame Sadie for Alex's death, whereupon both Ava and Kim suddenly begin vomiting a black substance. Sadie gets help and the people in the house give Ava and Kim a white liquid medicine to drink. Sadie confronts her friends for their strange behavior and tries to persuade them to leave; they refuse, in a trance, and decide to stay the night at the house. That night, Sadie has a nightmare of Alex being killed in a car accident. Waking up in the middle of the night, Ava and Kim are gone. She finds them outside around a bonfire, participating in a strange cult ritual with the others in the house. Investigating from the bush nearby, Sadie's foot becomes caught in the bear trap seen in the couple's car the day before. Hearing the commotion, Ava and Kim give chase as Sadie escapes the trap and moves into a nearby shed; here, she is accosted by an apparition of Alex. Terrified, Sadie runs out into the road and hails an approaching car for help only to get run over by a car in a cruel twist of [[dramatic irony|fate]].\n\nIn the road behind her, one of the floating enigmatic creatures can be seen watching Sadie.\n\n===The Accident===\n* Directed by [[David Bruckner]]\n* Written by David Bruckner\n\nThe driver of the car, Lucas ([[Mather Zickel]]), talks to his wife Claire on the phone. Distracted, he does not see Sadie and she is hit by his car. Lucas exits the car and sees Sadie lying on the ground, critically injured, and calls 911; however, he is unable to tell the dispatcher where he is. A certified EMT gets on the line to help. The voices of the dispatcher and the EMT tell Lucas to drive Sadie to a nearby town, where he finds a medical facility. Entering the facility, he finds it completely abandoned; after searching for help, the dispatcher opts to guide Lucas through performing lifesaving surgery; a third voice, that of a doctor, gets on the line. The voices convince Lucas to reach into Sadie's body cavity and manually compress her lungs, which kills her. The voices begin to laugh at Lucas, and he hangs up. He tries to escape the hospital but finds that all doors are locked. Shortly after, his phone rings again; the dispatchers persuade Lucas to talk about the incident. They agree that Lucas did not deserve this, and promptly tell him that he can leave. They mysteriously provide him with access to clean clothes and a new car, so it will be as though nothing happened. Lucas, hesitant to leave, is reassured that he will not need to worry about Sadie's death. He leaves the facility, enters the car, and drives away.\n\nAs he does, one of the floating creatures can be seen on the edge of the road overseeing the events.\n\n===Jailbreak===\n* Directed by [[Patrick Horvath]]\n* Written by Dallas Hallam & Patrick Horvath\n\nSandy ([[Maria Olsen]]), the dispatcher on the phone with Lucas, watches him drive away from a nearby payphone. She hangs up, and walks into a bar named The Trap; across the parking lot, Danny ([[David Yow]]) gets out of his car. Inside, the bartender Al (Matt Peters) reprimands Sandy for leaving the door open. An argument ensues between the two and Warren (Tyler Tuione), another patron in the bar. Danny barges in with a shotgun, and demands to know the location of his sister. Warren, revealed to be a demon, cuts a gash into Danny's back; Danny blows off Warren's clawed hand with the shotgun. Danny takes Al hostage and forces him to drive to his sister's location: the back room of an ice cream parlor. There are demons Danny cannot see closing in on him as Al leads him through a secret entrance into a hidden room. Inside the room, he finds his sister Jesse ([[Tipper Newton]]) applying a tattoo to a patron's back. Danny tells Jesse that he has come to rescue her; she tells him that she is there by choice, and refuses to leave. Danny kills Al and kidnaps his sister, carrying her to his car. The locals, all demons, chase Danny as he drives quickly away. They drive for some time and then stop when the road peters out into the desert. Jesse begs Danny not to go off the road; Danny, with the locals in pursuit, decides he has no other option. The car shakes violently as the pair drive out into the desert, and eventually Danny stops the car. Jesse reveals that she killed their parents, and that she deserves to live in the town. The demons pull Danny out of the car; Jesse leaves him behind and drives away. She smiles and turns on the radio.\n\nAs she drives, one of the floating creatures can be seen in the moonlight overseeing Jesse's plight.\n\n===The Way In===\n* Directed by Radio Silence\n* Written by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin\n\nJem (Hassie Harrison) exits the bathroom at Freez'n Over and sees Jesse walk back to the secret door. Jem then rejoins her parents, Cait and Daryl ([[Kate Beahan]] and [[Gerald Downey]]), to finish their food. Jem is going to college and this is their last weekend together before she leaves. As they leave Freez'n Over someone in the parking lot watches them get into their car and drive to their vacation house. They are about to have dinner when three masked men break into the house. Daryl and Cait are caught while Jem hides. Daryl realizes that he knows who the men are and what they want, and begs them to spare his family. One of the men whispers to Cait what Daryl did and she is astonished at her husband's secret. The same man then says \"eye for an eye\" and kills her in front of her husband. Jem then stabs one of the men in the back with scissors and takes the bat he was holding. Surprisingly, the other two tell her to leave. She runs away and they kill Daryl. As he is dying, the man in the mask holds up the photograph of Katherine that Mitch was looking at in ''The Way Out'' to be the last thing he ever sees. After Daryl is dead, they remove their masks and they are recognizable as Mitch and Jack. As they are leaving, Jem returns and fights back. She injures them badly but when she is about to escape, Mitch kills her. The men feel guilty because they went too far, but it is too late. Outside, the ground opens up as the enigmatic floating creatures from below come through the dead bodies. The men try to escape but the third masked man is dragged down by the tentacles from beneath the Earth. As the ground behind them continues to crumble, Mitch and Jack drive away. They are chased by one of the floating creatures, but Jack accelerates and runs it down. Jack says they are going home as they get back on the highway. Mitch looks at a photograph of his daughter Katherine as they drive away. Out in the desert, Mitch sees the creatures stalking them but does not tell Jack.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Chad Villella]] as Mitch \n* [[Matt Bettinelli-Olpin]] as Jack\n* [[Fabianne Therese]] as Sadie\n* [[Hannah Marks]] as Ava\n* Nathalie Love as Kim\n* [[Kate Beahan]] as Cait\n* Davey Johnson as Dale\n* [[Susan Theresa Burke|Susan Burke]] as Betty\n* Tyler Tuione as Warren\n* [[Gerald Downey]] as Daryl\n* [[Larry Fessenden]] as The D.J (voice)\n* [[Dana Gould]] as Raymond Kensington\n* [[Anessa Ramsey]] as Betty Kensington/Phone Operator\n* Hassie Harrison as Jem\n* Davey Johnson as Dale\n* [[Tipper Newton]] as Jesse\n* [[Maria Olsen]] as Sandy\n* Kristina Pesic as Sutter\n* Matt Peters as Al\n* [[David Yow]] as Danny\n* [[Mather Zickel]] as Lucas\n* [[Justin Welborn]] as Surgeon (voice)\n* Karla Droege as EMT (voice)\n* Karina Fontes as Alex\n* [[Roxanne Benjamin]] as Claire\n* Max and Nick Folkman as The Kensington Twins\n* [[Brad Miska]] as Diner Patron\n}}\n\n==Production==\nProducers [[Brad Miska]] and Radio Silence began working together in 2014 to create the concept as Miska brought on Benjamin, Bruckner, and Horvath to fill out the other director roles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/09/15/tiff-2015-southbound|title='Southbound' directors talk about their TIFF-screening horror film \u2014 exclusive image|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref><ref name=sbiwrs-p2>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-972997335/southbound-interview-pt2-with-radio-silence|title=\"Southbound\" Interview Pt.2 with Radio Silence|work=The Cinema Files|access-date=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nPre-production began in shortly thereafter and the filmmakers (most of whom had previously worked together on ''[[V/H/S]]'') collaborated throughout the process.<ref name=AFI>AFI Fest (2015-4-11) ''The AFI FEST Interview: SOUTHBOUND'' http://blog.afi.com/the-afi-fest-interview-southbound-director-roxanne-benjamin/</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in various locations throughout the greater Los Angeles area and the Mojave Desert in 2015, including [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] and [[Amboy, California|Amboy]].<ref name=Collis>Collis, Clark (2015-9-15) ''Entertainment Weekly'' https://ew.com/article/2015/09/15/tiff-2015-southbound</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Watch the First Seven Minutes of Horror Anthology Southbound|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/01/21/southbound-horror-anthology-7-minutes/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|author=Collis, Clark|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> Roy\u2019s was filmed at [[Roy's Motel and Caf\u00e9]] in [[Amboy, California|Amboy]], California.\n\nA festival version of the film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 16, 2015 and the final cut was released theatrically on February 5, 2016 in a [[limited release]].<ref name=\"Townsend, Lauren\">{{cite web|title=Watch the First Seven Minutes of TIFF Horror Sensation 'Southbound'|url=https://indiewire.com/article/exclusive-watch-the-first-seven-minutes-of-tiff-horror-sensation-southbound-20160120|publisher=IndieWire|author=Townsend, Lauren|date=January 20, 2016|access-date=January 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[Film score|score]] was composed and recorded by The Gifted and was created using authentic analog synths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/74330 |title=MEET THE CREW: Composers: Louis Castle and James Bairian |website=Aintitcool.com |date=2016-02-01 |access-date=2016-02-01}}</ref> The official soundtrack was released on February 9, 2016 by  Headquarters Music.\n\nThe film features songs by Mickey Western, [[Link 80]], Barbara Paul, The-Front, [[Lay Low]], Patrick Horvath, [[Ben Lovett]] with Ryan Levine, Nick Africano, the Soft White Sixties and the Atom Age.<ref>Radio Silence http://www.hiradiosilence.com/soundtracks/</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2017, [[MondoCon|Mondo]] released a limited edition vinyl pressing of the score.

These include:\n# The truck from ''The Way Out'' is visible in the \"Freez'n Over\" parking lot at the beginning of ''The Way In''.\n# The house is the same in both ''The Way Out'' and ''The Way In'' and many of the same shots are used, including of the decorative lights outside (when Mitch enters in ''The Way Out'' and when the masked man enters in ''The Way In'') and when Jem walks down the same hallway where Mitch gets trapped.\n# In ''The Way Out'', the creatures stalk Mitch and Jack in exactly the same fashion that Mitch and Jack stalk the family in ''The Way In'', first from afar before closing in and again, similar shots are used in both.\n# Jack is grabbed by the creature in the bathroom with a T-shirt, which is what he used to kill Cait.\n# The shaking in Roy's Cafe is the sound made when the ground opens up in ''The Way In'', implying that these are the creatures below the diner.\n# When Jack is killed by the creature, he dies in much the same way as Cait did when he suffocated her.\n# The knocks that lure Mitch into the motel room in ''The Way Out'' are the same pattern as the knocks from outside the house in ''The Way In''.\n# The motel room that Mitch enters is room 6255 in ''The Way Out'', the same as the house's address in ''The Way In''.\n# The mask that Mitch wears in ''The Way In'' is visible on the table in the last shot of ''The Way Out'', and it is what he was looking at when he first hears his daughter giggle.\n# The songs \"Don't Let the Party End\" and \"Goodbye, Goodbye\" are used in both though different parts of the songs are played.\n# The DJ's voice-over ([[Larry Fessenden]]) is in both segments however the ending version has slightly different dialogue implying that the loop is not the same every time and that the characters have the option of making better choices with the possibility that they may be allowed to escape should they cease to make the same wrong choices time and time again.<ref name=DSF>{{cite web |url=http://darkskyfilms.com/southbound/ |title=Southbound {{!}} DarkSkyFilms |website=darkskyfilms.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305122907/http://darkskyfilms.com/southbound/ |archive-date=2016-03-05}}</ref><ref name=sbiwrs-p2/><ref name=\"Townsend, Lauren\"/><ref name=\"Reddit\"/><ref name=\"Quiet Earth\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|4935334}}\n* {{allmovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title|southbound}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|m/southbound}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Radio Silence Productions}}\n{{Tyler Gillett}}\n{{David Bruckner}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Southbound (2015 Film)}}\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 horror films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett]]\n[[Category:2010s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:2015 horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Bruckner]]\n[[Category:Films set in deserts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Bruckner]]\n[[Category:Home invasions in film]]\n[[Category:American horror anthology films]]\n[[Category:Matricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:2010s road movies]]\n[[Category:The Orchard (company) films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about purgatory]]\n[[Category:Time loop films]]\n[[Category:Demons in film]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roxanne Benjamin]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
