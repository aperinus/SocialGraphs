On the news team, Burgundy works alongside Veronica Corningstone, KVWN's first female reporter and anchor, and his childhood friends: lead [[Correspondent|field reporter]] Brian Fantana, [[Sports commentator|sportscaster]] Champion \"Champ\" Kind, and [[Weather presenter|meteorologist]] Brick Tamland. One night Burgundy, Fantana, Kind and Tamland host KVWN's 6 o'clock newscast, then attend a party with anchors from other stations.\n\nThe next morning, Mouse, Kanshasha X, Malcolm Y and Paul Hauser, a group of terrorists calling themselves 'The Alarm Clock', [[Bank robbery|rob a bank]]. Later that day, Ed Harken, the KVWN station manager, informs Burgundy, Fantana, Kind, Tamland, Corningstone and other KVWN employees of this, stating that it is the Alarm Clock's third bank robbery.\n\nThe members of the Alarm Clock celebrate their latest robbery, the money from which they intend to use as funding for 'the revolution'. The revolution, however, does not have a clear goal; Hauser, who is responsible for writing 'the manifesto', a document explaining the revolution, has not yet done so after an increasingly long time. Hauser receives criticism for this from the other members of the group and, in panic, states that the group's mission is eliminating [[propaganda]] from television, showing a [[public service announcement]] of Burgundy denouncing illicit drugs as an example of such propaganda. The group expresses uniform contempt for Burgundy after watching him, and taking over television broadcasts becomes the goal of the revolution.\n\nThat night, Burgundy gives Corningstone a tour of San Diego. While doing so, Burgundy points out the fictional San Diego Observatory to her and expresses a desire to broadcast news from there. Burgundy marvels over the number of viewers that he believes such a broadcast would be able to reach.\n\nThe next day, Corningstone reports on a [[fashion show]] composed of cats. While doing so, Hauser, not revealing himself as a member of the Alarm Clock, introduces himself to Corningstone. He asks her various questions regarding television broadcasting, as part of the Alarm Clock's plan to take over television. Hauser recites a motto of the Alarm Clock to Corningstone, then leaves.\n\nLater, the Alarm Clock attempts to rob another bank, but the teller, after questioning the group's masks, refuses to give them money. When entering the bank, however, Hauser yells the same motto he declaimed to Corningstone. Corningstone, after watching a [[closed-circuit television]] video of the robbery, recalls having heard the motto from Hauser, thereby identifying him as the person in the video and a member of the Alarm Clock.\n\nBurgundy, wanting to investigate the Alarm Clock himself, gets permission from Harken to be a field reporter. He then steals information from Corningstone that she had gathered about Hauser. Using an address found by Corningstone, Burgundy, Fantana, Kind and Tamland attempt to interview Hauser. After initially going to the wrong house, they find Hauser at his home. At first, he denies evidence of his involvement in the Alarm Clock, but then an alarm sounds. As this happens, Hauser admits involvement in the group and, after running outside, steals the news team's van, of which doors had been left open.\n\nAfter the events of his interview with Hauser, Burgundy is fired from KVWN. His reputation worsens quickly and Corningstone becomes KVWN's lead anchor. Burgundy visits his [[Mentorship|mentor]] Jess Moondragon, to whom he reiterates his desire to broadcast news from the observatory; repeating his belief that such a broadcast would reach a vast audience.\n\nCorningstone arrives at her apartment to be kidnapped at gunpoint by Hauser and Kanshasha X. Garth Holiday, a KVWN employee, informs Harken of Corningstone's kidnapping, interrupting Harken's reprimanding of his son Chris in doing so.\n\nWes Mantooth, lead anchor at rival KQHS channel 9 news, reports on Corningstone's kidnapping, catching Burgundy's attention. Mantooth reports that police believe the Alarm Clock kidnapped Corningstone to broadcast the message of their revolution, but the location from which they want to deliver this broadcast is unknown. Burgundy, however, realizes that the group has gone to the San Diego Observatory, because of his belief that a broadcast made from the observatory would be able to reach a large audience. Burgundy is reemployed at KVWN and he, Fantana, Kind and Tamland set to rescue Corningstone.\n\nAt the observatory, the Alarm Clock is preparing for their broadcast. Hauser remarks at the number of people they will reach. In the distance, Burgundy, Fantana, Kind and Tamland are greeted by Moondragon, who provides them with transportation to the observatory. After getting lost and briefly considering the cannibalism of Fantana, the group reaches the observatory.\n\nBurgundy enters the observatory, but is captured by the Alarm Clock and handcuffed next to Corningstone. Hauser then orders Corningstone to read the Alarm Clock's manifesto on air, but she refuses on account of her integrity, even after Kanshasha X threatens to kill her. Burgundy, however, volunteers to read the manifesto. Hauser reveals the manifesto to be an advocacy for [[recycling]], [[electric car]]s, and [[personal computer]]s, concepts which the other members of the Alarm Clock and Burgundy consider absurd. Malcolm Y then demands Burgundy improvise a statement promoting the Alarm Clock on air. The highly teleprompter-dependent Burgundy is initially speechless, but then equates improvising on air to [[jazz]] and reveals their location. The members of the Alarm Clock realize this, prompting Burgundy to call out for the news team; Fantana, Kind and Tamland then rappel into the observatory and easily overpower the Alarm Clock.\n\nFantana, Kind, Burgundy and Corningstone return to a cheering crowd in San Diego. A [[Television network|network]] reporter offers Burgundy a position on an upcoming network show documenting news anchors themselves. Burgundy responds by offering the position to Corningstone. Mantooth sees Burgundy and, although he hates Burgundy, proclaims respect for him.\n\nThe members of the Alarm Clock are later incarcerated for five years. After being released, they invent the [[Macintosh]], from which they make {{USD}}6 billion.\n\n==Cast==\nMain cast in credits order:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Will Ferrell]]\u00a0as Ron Burgundy\n* [[Christina Applegate]]\u00a0as Veronica Corningstone\n* [[Paul Rudd]]\u00a0as Brian Fantana\n* [[Steve Carell]]\u00a0as Brick Tamland\n* [[David Koechner]]\u00a0as Champion \"Champ\" Kind\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]]\u00a0as Paul Hauser\n* [[Fred Willard]]\u00a0as Ed Harken\n* [[Chris Parnell]]\u00a0as Garth Holliday\n* [[Chuck D]]\u00a0as Malcolm Y\n* [[Maya Rudolph]]\u00a0as Kanshashga X\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]]\u00a0as Helen\n* [[Fred Armisen]]\u00a0as Tino\n* [[Chad Everett]]\u00a0as Jess Moondragon\n* [[Tara Subkoff]] as Mouse\n* [[Justin Long]]\u00a0as Chris Harken\n* Michael Coleman\u00a0as a [[construction worker]]\n* [[Steve Bannos]] as Nikos \n* [[Amy Poehler]]\u00a0as a [[bank teller]]\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Scotty the [[camera operator|cameraman]]<ref name=\"wakeupimdb\"/>\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Wes Mantooth\n* [[Bill Kurtis]] as the narrator<ref>{{cite book|year=2017|editor1-last=Wexman|editor1-first=Virginia Wright|title=Directed|url={{Google books|ohBeDwAAQBAJ|page=141|plainurl=yes}}|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|page=141|quote=Instead, they were quickly edited into an additional feature-length movie, ''Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie'', also released in 2004.

''Wake-Up Ron Burgundy'' is nothing more than a collection of deleted scenes and alternate takes ... sewn together with narration and a left out story element included to make it seem like a follow up. The worst part about this is that a majority of the alternate takes already appear on the deleted scenes or blooper reel of the first film, as well as a majority of the theatrical trailers.\"<ref>{{cite web| work=DVD Review |title= Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!) & Wake Up Ron Burgundy |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/review.php?id=820 |first=Bill |last=Beyrer | publisher= CinemaBlend| access-date= 2014-10-16 }}</ref>\n\nCollin Souter of eFilmCritic was more positive, in his 4 of 5 stars review: \"It's a bit choppier than the original and wouldn't make for a good movie on its own, but do you really care?
