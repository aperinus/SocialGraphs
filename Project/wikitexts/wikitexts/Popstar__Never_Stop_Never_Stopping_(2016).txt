Also produced by [[Judd Apatow]], it co-stars [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Tim Meadows]], [[Imogen Poots]], [[Joan Cusack]], and [[Maya Rudolph]].\n\nThe film was released on June 3, 2016 by [[Universal Pictures]]  and grossing just over $9 million, failing to meet its budget of $20 million. Despite this, it received positive reviews from critics and has developed a [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\nConner Friel is a musical prodigy at an early age, and he forms a [[pop rap]] group dubbed \"The Style Boyz\" with his childhood friends Lawrence Dunn and Owen Bouchard. They almost instantly gain fame in the music industry and inspire many of today's musicians. However, after failing to receive credit for writing Conner's guest verse on a popular single, Lawrence leaves.\n\nAfter the Style Boyz disband, Conner becomes a solo act, taking on the name \"Conner4Real\", with Owen as his DJ. Lawrence begins farming in Colorado after a failed attempt at going solo. Conner's debut album ''Thriller, Also'' rockets to the top of the charts, and his fame increases. In 2015, Conner releases his sophomore album, ''Connquest'', which is heavily panned due to his writing every song himself and using hundreds of different producers rather than Owen's original beats. With low sales, Conner's manager Harry suggests having Aquaspin, a home appliance manufacturer, sponsor the tour. The company's appliances begin playing Conner's songs when in use, causing a nationwide power outage.\n\nConner begins his tour, but the shows do not sell as well as he had hoped. Harry suggests they hire hip-hop artist Hunter the Hungry as an opening act, and the ticket sales begin to rise. Conner adds new gimmicks to his act, including a robotic mask for Owen, and publicizes his relationship with actress Ashley Wednesday. But when a trick is seemingly botched in [[Nashville]], Conner is exposed naked (without his penis visible) mid-concert and becomes the subject of mockery. Conner's publicist, Paula Klein, suggests he pull another publicity stunt to deflect attention from his humiliation. Conner decides to propose to Ashley on live TV, with a display including several trained wolves and a performance by Seal. Seal's vocals agitate the wolves, and they break loose, mauling the attendees. The backlash against Conner grows, and Ashley breaks up with him and starts dating Seal, who sues Conner for his injuries.\n\nWorried about the declining quality of his friend's music, Owen sets up a meeting between himself, Conner, and Lawrence. The reunion ends poorly when Conner refuses to acknowledge that Lawrence wrote the track that launched his career. As the solo tour progresses Hunter's career takes off, selling more records than Connor, and Hunter begins to extend his opening performances. At a concert, Hunter announces that he will perform as long as possible, causing Conner to rush to the stage. A brawl ensues when Hunter quietly admits that he orchestrated Conner's wardrobe malfunction. Conner demands that Harry let Hunter go and fires Harry after discovering he has signed Hunter. ''Connquest'' is later knocked off the charts, and Aquaspin decides to pull their sponsorship.\n\nThe remainder of the tour is canceled, and Owen decides to leave the team when Conner tests Owen and the entourage's loyalty by making them pancakes mixed with dog feces. After his beloved pet turtle Maximus dies, Conner sinks into a depression and moves back into his mother's house. He begins drinking heavily and starts selling crude horse drawings online. Paula forces Conner to leave the house and takes him to a club featuring Owen. Conner and Owen reconcile and decide to finally make amends with Lawrence. Conner gives Lawrence his Poppy, apologizes, and acknowledges his contributions. As the three get high and collaborate in Lawrence's studio, Conner receives news from Paula that a six-minute slot has opened for Conner to perform at the Poppy Music Awards due to Taylor Swift being arrested for murder. With encouragement from his friends, he decides to reunite the Style Boyz.\n\nAt the Poppys, Hunter and Mariah Carey argue on stage, and Harry quits as Hunter's manager after being insulted by him. Conner reconciles with Harry and later finds out that the six-minute slot has been shortened to three, forcing him to perform either a Conner4Real song or a Style Boyz song. Conner decides to perform the Style Boyz's new song \"Incredible Thoughts\" featuring Michael Bolton. Conner reflects on his lessons and the value of holding onto relationships after reaching stardom. He introduces a new baby turtle named Maximus II before a wolf from the disastrous proposal attacks him.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Conner \"Kid Conner\" Friel / Conner4Real\n** Evan Fine as ten-year-old Conner\n* [[Jorma Taccone]] as Owen \"Kid Contact\" Bouchard, Conner's former bandmate and current DJ\n** [[Maxwell Jenkins]] as ten-year-old Owen\n* [[Akiva Schaffer]] as Lawrence \"Kid Brain\" Dunn, Conner's former bandmate and songwriter who became a farmer following the breakup\n** Elliott Smith as ten-year-old Lawrence\n* [[Sarah Silverman]]<ref name=\"SilvermanCast\">{{cite news |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |date=May 14, 2015 |title=Sarah Silverman Joins Andy Samberg in Lonely Island Music Comedy (Exclusive) |work=hollywoodreporter.com |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sarah-silverman-joins-andy-samberg-795700 |access-date=May 19, 2015}}</ref> as Paula Klein, Conner's publicist\n* [[Tim Meadows]]<ref name=\"MeadowsCast\">{{cite news |last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |date=May 19, 2015 |title=Tim Meadows Joins Lonely Island Pic 'Conner4real' |website=Deadline Hollywood |url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/tim-meadows-joins-lonely-island-movie-conner4real-1201429890/ |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref> as Harry Duggins, Conner's manager\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Deborah, a representative for Aquaspin\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Tilly Friel, Conner's mother\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Ashley Wednesday, Conner's girlfriend<ref name=\"PootsCast\">{{cite news |last1=Sneider |first1=Jeff |date=May 19, 2015 |title=Imogen Poots in Talks to Play Andy Samberg's Love Interest in Lonely Island Comedy (Exclusive) |work=thewrap.com |url=https://www.thewrap.com/imogen-poots-in-talks-to-play-andy-sambergs-love-interest-in-lonely-island-comedy-exclusive/ |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Redd]] as Hunter the Hungry, an underground rapper who tours with Conner\n* Edgar Blackmon and [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] as Eddie and Sponge, members of Conner's entourage who serve as his [[wikt:yes man|yes men]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|title=James Buckley Joins Lonely Island Pic 'Conner4real'; Evan Jones Set For 'Shot Caller'; Goldenthal Lauded In Krakow|url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/james-buckley-lonely-island-conner4real-evan-jones-shot-caller-1201434226/|access-date=July 12, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMembers of Conner's staff include: Ashley Moore as Sarah, his personal assistant; [[Bill Hader]] as Zippy, a roadie; [[Danny Strong]] as his perspective manipulator; [[Will Forte]] as his bagpipe player; and [[Justin Timberlake]] as Tyrus Quash, Conner's chef.
