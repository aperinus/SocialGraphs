She has just been accepted to [[Harvard Law School]]. At her sister's wedding, after being sent out from her hiding place in the storage room with a bottle of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], she meets Connie Fitzpatrick, a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] photographer who takes an instant liking to her and nicknames her \"Guinevere\". Her visit to his loft in order to pick up the wedding photographs soon blossoms into a full-blown affair, and Harper eventually moves in with Connie as he instructs her in the ways of art, in particular photography.\n\nAfter a brutal confrontation with Harper's mother, Deborah, and Harper's discovery that Connie has a history of relationships with young women, the film comes to a climax in a downtrodden [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] hotel where Connie ends the relationship by kicking out Harper. She returns only once, four years later, as he is dying from [[cirrhosis of the liver]], and meets the other Guineveres he has had. On the rooftop, she describes her personal view of his kind of [[heaven]], which she affectionately titles \"The Connie Special\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Connie Fitzpatrick\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Harper Sloane\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Deborah Sloane\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Billie\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Walter\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Patty\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as Zack\n* [[Emily Procter]] as Susan Sloane\n* Sharon McNight as Leslie (as Sharon Mcnight)\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Ed\n* [[Carlton Wilborn]] as Jay\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Cindy\n* [[Jasmine Guy]] as Linda\n\n== Production ==\nWith the exception of some exterior shots in the [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco|Pacific Heights]] neighborhood of San Francisco, the film was mostly shot in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Filmed in Pacific Heights |url=https://newfillmore.com/fillmore-classics/filmed-in-pacific-hts/ |access-date=2022-11-02 |website=The New Fillmore |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Graham |first=Bob |date=1999-09-19 |title=Romance for the Ages / Audrey Wells spotlights mentor-student relationship in 'Guinevere' |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Romance-for-the-Ages-Audrey-Wells-spotlights-2907647.php |access-date=2022-11-02 |website=San Francisco Chronicle |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Guinevere'' holds an approval rating of 86% based on 35 reviews on the critics website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guinevere |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1093738-guinevere |access-date=October 29, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, \"This patient, perceptive, nonjudgmental love story about age difference is the first to convincingly explain the temporal physics of [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|May-December romances]].
