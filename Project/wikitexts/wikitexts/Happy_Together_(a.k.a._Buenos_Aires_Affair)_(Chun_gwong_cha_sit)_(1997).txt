They visit [[Argentina]] together but break up after they become lost while traveling to visit the [[Iguazu Falls]]. Without the money to fly home, Fai begins to work as a doorman at a [[tango]] bar in [[Buenos Aires]], while Po-Wing lives promiscuously, often seen by Fai with different men. After Fai accuses Po-Wing of spending all of his money and stranding him in Argentina, Po-Wing steals from one of his acquaintances and is severely beaten. Fai allows Po-Wing to live with him in his small rented room and cares for his injuries. They attempt to reconcile their relationship, though it is marred by mutual suspicion and jealousy.\n\nFai loses his job at the tango bar after beating the man who injured Po-Wing. He begins working at a Chinese restaurant where he befriends Chang, a [[Taiwan]]ese co-worker. Later, Po-Wing and Fai have a final argument where Fai refuses to return Po-Wing's passport. Po-Wing moves out of the apartment when he fully recovers. Sometime thereafter, Chang leaves Buenos Aires to continue his travels. Having finally earned enough money to fly home, Fai decides to visit the Iguazu Falls alone before he leaves. Meanwhile, Po-Wing returns to the empty apartment, heartbroken, realizing that Fai is gone for good.\n\nFai returns to Hong Kong but has a stopover in [[Taipei]]. Coincidentally, he ends up eating at a food stall in a [[night market]] run by Chang's family. He steals a photo of Chang from the booth, saying that even though he doesn't know if he will ever see Chang again, he knows where to find him.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Leslie Cheung]] as Ho Po-Wing\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as Lai Yiu-Fai\n* [[Chang Chen|Chen Chang]] as Chang\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Box office===\nDuring its Hong Kong theatrical release, ''Happy Together'' made HK$8,600,141 at the box office.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1997 \u9999\u6e2f\u7968\u623f {{!}} \u4e2d\u56fd\u7535\u5f71\u7968\u623f\u699c|url=http://www.boxofficecn.com/hkboxoffice1997|access-date=2022-01-01|language=zh-CN}}</ref>\n\n''Happy Together'' also had a limited theatrical run in North America through [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]], where it grossed US$320,319.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=happytogether.htm|title=Happy Together (1997) - Box Office Mojo|website=boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship ===\nThe producers of the film considered censoring the film, specifically the opening sex scene for certain audiences.<ref name=\"Elley\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/happy-together-2-1117329753/|title=Film Review: Happy Together|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=1997-05-25|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> Posters for the movie featuring the two leads fully clothed with their legs intertwined was banned from public places in Hong Kong and removed all together before the movie's release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3011485/when-wong-kar-wais-gay-film-happy-together-won|title=When Wong Kar-wai's gay film Happy Together won big at Cannes|date=2019-05-23|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n===Home Media===\n[[Kino International]] released the film on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on June 8, 2010.

However, by winning the Cannes festival award for Best Director for ''Happy Together'', his first major award, Wong was given a spotlight on the international stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2094145/pictures-happy-together-tony-leung-leslie-cheung-romance-put-wong|title=In pictures: Wong Kar-wai's romantic film Happy Together turns 20|date=2017-05-14|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nIn this film, Wong Kar-wai moved away from his previous centralization of American and British music, instead, mostly favouring [[South America]]n music. This transnationalism \"decentralizes America\" and forms new connections between cultures that are not conventionally linked (Hong Kong and Argentina). The first song of the film, [[Caetano Veloso]]'s cover of \"[[Cucurrucuc\u00fa paloma]]\", a sad [[ballad]] about a man waiting for his lover to return, plays when the couple breaks up for the first time in the film. Here, the [[Iguazu Falls]] are seen for the first time and it is also the first shot of the film that is in colour. The song extends Fai's thoughts, where he is imagining the waterfall, which he associated with Po-Wing. His sadness and lovesickness thereby become apparent in this South American setting.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|author=Kersting, Erik |title=East, west, and gendered subjectivity : the music of Wong Kar-Wai|year=2018|isbn=978-0-438-03277-4|oclc=1128098058}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical motifs ===\nThe [[Frank Zappa]] song \"Chunga's Revenge\" is played throughout the movie \"emphasizing [Fai's] difficult relationship with [Po-Wing].\" The loud guitar chorus represents Po-Wing's \"volatile, flamboyant nature,\" which contrasts the somber trumpet and slower beat representing Fai's sensitivity and steadiness. This song is also linked to Lai's loneliness and his longing to be \"happy together\" while showing the difference between the two characters and the increasing emotional distance between them as the film progresses.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[Astor Piazzolla]]'s \"Prologue (Tango Apasionado),\" \"Finale (Tango Apasionado),\" and \"Milonga for Three\" and similar [[bandoneon]] songs play when the couple is both together and apart, representing their relationship. These songs play during romantic scenes such as the taxi scene and the tango in the kitchen. However, it is also played after Fai and Po-Wing break up for the last time and Po-Wing dances the tango with a random man while thinking about when he danced with Fai. The last time this song is played is when Fai reaches the waterfall and the same shot of the [[Iguazu Falls]] at the beginning of the film is seen but this time with the \"Finale\" song. This \"eulogizes that relationship\" as Po-Wing breaks down in Fai's old apartment, realizing that he has abandoned their relationship because Fai left behind the lamp while Fai mourns their relationship at the falls.<ref name=\":4\" /> Wong Kar-wai discovered Piazzolla's music when he bought his CDs in the Amsterdam airport on his way to Buenos Aires to film this movie.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Wong, Kar-wai |title=Wong Kar-Wai : interviews|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4968-1284-1|oclc=1023090817}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]],\" [[the Turtles]]' song covered by Danny Chung, is the last song to be played in the film, when Fai is on the train in Taipei. This song is used to subvert Western music tropes that use it \"to celebrate a budding romance or as an ironic commentary on the lack of such a romance.\" It also shows that \"Lai is at peace with their relationship, making it a crucial narrative device denoting the meaning of the film.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile interpretations vary, [[Wong Kar-wai]] has said that:\n\n:\"In this film, some audiences will say that the title seems to be very cynical, because it is about two persons living together, and at the end, they are just separate. But to me, happy together can apply to two persons or apply to a person and his past, and I think sometimes when a person is at peace with himself and his past, I think it is the beginning of a relationship which can be happy, and also he can be more open to more possibilities in the future with other people.\"<ref>{{cite interview|subject=Wong Kar-wai |interviewer=Khoi Lebinh |interviewer2=David Eng|title=Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.asiastudios.com/interviews/members/wongkarwai.html|access-date=20 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514140143/http://www.asiastudios.com/interviews/members/wongkarwai.html|archive-date=14 May 2008|publisher=WBAI|date=27 October 1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Themes and interpretations ==\n\n=== Nationality, belonging, and cultural identity ===\nAt the very beginning of the movie, Wong includes shots of Fai's [[British National (Overseas) passport|British National Overseas Passport]] as a way to indicate to the audience that this film will be dealing with issues of [[nationality]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinezen.hk/?p=9158|title=\u57cb\u85cf\u5728\u300a\u6625\u5149\u4e4d\u6d29\u300b\u88e1\u7684\u6642\u4ee3\u60c5\u7dd2 {{!}} \u6620\u756b\u624b\u6c11|website=cinezen.hk|date=10 February 2020|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==== The Handover of Hong Kong ====\nReleased in May 1997, intentionally before the [[handover of Hong Kong]] from the British to China on 30 June 1997 after 100 years of [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule, the film represents the uncertainty of the future felt by [[Hongkongers]] at the time.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/09/03/the-brief-idyll-of-late-90s-wong-kar-wai/|title=The Brief Idyll of Late-Nineties Wong Kar-Wai|last=Aw|first=Tash|date=2019-09-03|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The film's subtitle: \"A Story About Reunion\" also implies that the film would comment on the handover.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Suner|first=Asuman|date=2006|title=Outside in: 'accented cinema' at large|journal=Inter-Asia Cultural Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=363\u2013382|doi=10.1080/14649370600849223|hdl=11693/49209|s2cid=145174876|issn=1464-9373|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The inclusion of the date in the opening and the news broadcast of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s death on 20 February 1997 serve to place the audience explicitly in the time period immediately before the [[Handover of Hong Kong]].

Fai, however, is able to see the waterfall and go to Taiwan but it is not shown whether Fai is able to reconcile with his father or not.

Sad Young Men in East Asian Gay Cinema|date=2018-10-24|pages=187\u2013200|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315877174-7|isbn=978-1-315-87717-4|s2cid=239905480 }}</ref>\n\nA different interpretation stated that Fai, a gay man, represents the social freedoms that Hongkongers possess and the runaway son who travelled to the other side of the world: Buenos Aires in the film and Britain historically. But, this son (Hong Kong and Fai) \"must return and reconcile his differences with old-fashioned China,\" which is represented by Fai's father. Chang here, represents Taiwan, a country with a similar past as Hong Kong with China, who comforts Fai (Hong Kong), showing him that there is hope for the future. This hope is demonstrated through the increasing saturation of the film as Fai's life becomes more and more stable.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Buenos Aires ====\nWong's choice of Buenos Aires is particular because it is the antipode of Hong Kong, meaning it is on the opposite side of the world and in an opposite time. This had been interpreted as a place where Fai and Po-Wing were looking for the opposite of home and Hong Kong. They do not describe this as a political allegory but rather a questioning of [[cultural identity]] and the definitions of \"home, [[Belongingness|belonging]], and migrancy\".<ref name=\":7\" /> Another interpretation viewed the scenes of Hong Kong shot upside down not as a political allegory either, but a way to show how far the characters were from their roots.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nSimilarly, the theme of displacement from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires interestingly emphasizes their similarities rather than their differences when compared to the shots of Hong Kong in Wong Kar-wai's previous films. Despite being on the other side of the world and far from their \"home\", the couple experiences the same problems, implying the inevitability of their relationship's deterioration. By emphasizing the similarities between these two places, Wong emphasizes the homelessness and lack of belonging of both Fai and Po-Wing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Confinement ====\nAnother theme of the film is the sense of confinement and claustrophobia that accompanies the sense of non-belonging of Fai and Po-Wing. This is conveyed through the shaky handheld camera, the small size poor lighting, and dirtiness of Fai's apartment, the kitchen, alleys, the tango bar, the restaurant kitchen, and the public bathroom corridor. This confinement is also manifested through Po-Wing's confinement to Fai's apartment because his injured hands prevent him from taking care of himself. Later, Po-Wing is also confined to Buenos Aires because Fai refuses to return his passport. Yet, the imagery of the [[Iguazu Falls]] contrasts the theme of confinement with the symbolic openness of possibility and hope of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Marginalization ====\nOne interpretation explained that the lack of a sense of belonging due to a combination of their marginal race, sexuality, and language<ref name=\":5\" /> in Buenos Aires and Hong Kong prevented Po-Wing and Fai from forming a stable relationship. This instability is in part shown through the instability of the camera in some shots, relating to the characters's inability to find their own place in the world.<ref name=\":3\" /> Neither place is welcoming and the couple experiences the same problems in both places.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe marginalization of Fai specifically is demonstrated by the way he visually cannot blend into the crowds and environments in Buenos Aires in comparison to Taipei. It is only in Taipei that Fai smiles, and it is implied that he feels a sense of belonging as he visits the Chang family noodle shop and takes the train. The movie does not definitively show that Fai returns to Hong Kong, making it possible that he stayed in Taipei, where he feels like he belongs and begins to have hope for the future.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== The Iguazu Falls and the lamp ===\nThe importance of the [[Iguazu Falls]] is established early on in the film when it is shown on the lamp that Po-Wing bought for Fai and is said to be the entire reason the couple chose to go to Buenos Aires in the first place.<ref name=\":7\" /> The real waterfall is then shown in Fai's imaginings after the first breakup as the first shot in colour. It is also shot from a bird's-eye view and given unrealistic blue and green coloring, giving it a supernatural visual effect.\n\nOne scholar interpreted the representation of the falls as a contemplation on the immensity of mother nature's power and the unpredictable nature of the future since the end of the waterfall is imperceivable. It also evokes a feeling of powerlessness in the face of nature and the future, paralleling the inevitability of the deterioration of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother scholar interpreted the waterfall itself as a symbol of Po-Wing and Fai's relationship because \"their passion is indeed torrential, destructive, always pounding away as it falls head forward and spirals downward towards an uncertain end\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=Chin-Yi|date=2016|title=Queer love in Wong Kar Wai's Happy Together (1997)|journal=Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture|volume=16|via=Gale Academic OneFile}}</ref>\n\nThe falls are seen throughout the film on the lamp in Fai's apartment, representing the continued hope and investment in his relationship with Po-Wing. However, when Fai finally visits the [[Iguazu Falls]] but without Po-Wing, leaving the lamp behind, Po-Wing understands that Fai has finally abandoned their relationship. Both Fai and Po-Wing mourn their relationship by looking at the waterfall, Fai seeing it in reality, and Po-Wing after having fixed the lamp's rotating mechanism.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Queerness ===\nThe [[queer]]ness of the film is highly contested. On one hand, it is characterized as \"one of the best films chronicling gay love ever made\" because of the universality of the problems that Fai and Po-Wing face in their relationship that exist in any relationship no matter the gender of the participants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nochimson|first=Martha P.|date=2005|title=Beautiful Resistance: The Early Films of Wong Kar-wai|journal=Cin\u00e9aste|volume=30|pages=9\u201313}}</ref> Many scholars and film critics agree that while being gay is not the subject of the film, its portrayal of gay romance is realistic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royer|first=Genevi\u00e8ve|date=September 1997|title=Happy Together|journal=S\u00e9quences|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> The film was praised for not casting the characters on gendered lines, questioning their manliness, and showing the complexity of gay men as social beings and individuals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWong Kar-wai explained that: <blockquote>\"In fact, I don't like people to see this film as a gay film. It's more like a story about human relationships and somehow the two characters involved are both men. Normally I hate movies with labels like 'gay film,\u2019 'art film' or 'commercial film.' There is only good film and bad film.\"<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>On the other hand, some scholars argue that one of the reasons that Po-Wing and Fai ended up in Buenos Aires is because they are gay and are thus exiled queer men.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Jeremy Tambling]], an author and critic, noted that the universalization of the gay relationship is not a positive aspect of the film because it erases the specificity of their experiences and the film's theme of marginalization.<ref name=\":0\"/> Furthermore, the film broadly portrays [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] values of hard work, frugality, and normativity, highlighting its lack of queerness and emphasis of [[heteronormativity]]. Fai is rewarded for following these values, as he works constantly, cooks, cares for others, wants to reconcile with his father, and saves his money, while Po-Wing lives in excess through his numerous sexual encounters, spending, lack of traditional work, and flamboyance. At the end of the film, Fai is able to reach his destination, Hong Kong/Taiwan and [[Iguazu Falls|the Iguazu Falls]], while Po-Wing is stuck in Buenos Aires. Chang also represents these values, as he works hard at the restaurant, saves enough money for his trip to the 'end of the world,' and has a loving family to return to in Taipei. The characters who conform to this normativity are rewarded while others are punished, thus emphasizing a \"straight\" narrative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yue|first=Audrey|date=2000|title=What's so queer about Happy Together? a.k.a.

The use of natural and ambient light mixed with small warm fill lights, as well as touches of color enlightened Laxton to create a \"dream-like sense of reality\" in his film.
