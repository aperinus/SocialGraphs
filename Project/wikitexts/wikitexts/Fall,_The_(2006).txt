It is based on the screenplay of the 1981 [[Cinema of Bulgaria|Bulgarian film]] ''[[Yo Ho Ho]]'' by [[Valeri Petrov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://offscreen.com/view/fall_tarsem|title=Liberations of Mind, Spirit, and Vision: The Fall by Tarsem Singh|work=Offscreen|first=Daniel|last=Garrett|date=16 October 2015|access-date=16 October 2015}}</ref> Its costume design is by [[Eiko Ishioka]]. The film was released to theaters in America and the UK in 2008 and earned $3.7 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1915 Los Angeles, [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] Roy Walker is hospitalized, bedridden and possibly paralyzed after taking a jump in his first film. He meets Alexandria, a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake, [[Alexander the Great]]. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day.\n\nThe next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior, a muscular ex-[[slave]] named [[Ota Benga|Otta Benga]], an Italian explosives expert called Luigi, [[Charles Darwin]] with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic.\n\nAlexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing [[morphine]] from the hospital pharmacy. Roy intends to use the morphine to commit [[suicide]] because the woman he loves has left him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills. Roy asks what happened to the rest of the pills in the bottle, and Alexandria says she threw all but three of them down the toilet, having mistaken the \"E\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \"3\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter.\n\nRoy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. He tells her she should leave after he takes them, but he knows she may not obey and may very well witness the death of the man she has come to view as her father. This does not come to pass, as the next morning Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a [[placebo]] rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy. She climbs onto the cabinet but loses her footing, falls, and sustains a severe head injury. She receives surgery, after which she is visited by Roy, where he confesses his deception. He encourages Alexandria to ask someone else to end the story, but she insists on hearing Roy's ending. Roy reluctantly begins the rest of the story.\n\nThe heroes die one by one, and it seems that Governor Odious will be triumphant. Alexandria becomes upset, and Roy insists, \"It's my story.\" She declares that it is hers too and exerts some influence on the course of the tale. The epic tale comes to an end with only the Bandit and his daughter remaining alive and Governor Odious dying. But in one final twist, Roy, who has been crafting the story to manipulate Alexandria and cope with his anger, targets the character representing his ex-girlfriend. He blames her for orchestrating the story's pain and suffering as part of a \"test\" of the Bandit's love for her. The Bandit rejects her as an act of ultimate triumph.\n\nWith the story complete, Roy and Alexandria, along with the patients and staff of the hospital, watch a viewing of the finished  \"flicker\" that Roy appeared in. With everyone laughing, only Roy's smile is broken in confusion when he sees that his life-threatening jump has been edited out of the film as another stuntman jumps instead.\n\nAlexandria's arm heals and she returns to the orange orchard where her family works. Her voice-over reveals that Roy has recovered and is now back at work again. As she talks, a montage of cuts from several of silent films' greatest and most dangerous stunts plays; she imagines all the stuntmen to be Roy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lee Pace]] as Roy Walker / Black Bandit<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/movies/11kehr.html|title=Special Effects From the Real World|work=New York Times|date=11 May 2008|first=Dave|last=Kehr|access-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>\n* Catinca Untaru as Alexandria / Bandit's daughter\n* [[Justine Waddell]] as Nurse Evelyn / Sister Evelyn\n* [[Daniel Caltagirone]] as Sinclair / Governor Odious\n* Marcus Wesley as Ice delivery man / Otta Benga\n* [[The Commandant|Robin Smith]] as One-legged actor / Luigi \n* [[Jeetu Verma]] as Orange picker / Indian\n* Kim Uylenbroek as Doctor / [[Alexander the Great]]\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Orderly / [[Charles Darwin]]\n* [[Emil Hostina]] as Alexandria's father / Blue Bandit\n* [[Julian Bleach]] as Mystic / Orange picker\n* Ronald France as Otto (the \"old man\")\n\n==Themes==\n''The Fall'' is a [[self-reflexive]] film that deals primarily with the concept of [[storytelling]]. Roy Walker tells a story to Alexandria, who imagines it, but there is a discontinuity between what he describes and how she sees it. Each character brings their own life into their experiences of the story; Roy takes inspiration from the film that he was working on before his accident, and Alexandria populates his story with familiar sights from her own life. The intimidating X-Ray operator becomes an enemy soldier, the 'Indian' is seen by her as an immigrant co-worker from the orange groves, while Roy's dialogue makes it clear to the audience that he meant 'Indian' to mean a Native American man from the Western film he was involved in.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Charlotte |title=Telling the (Wrong) Story: The disintegration of transcultural communication and narrative in The Fall |journal=Cineaction |date=2010 |issue=80 |pages=30\u201337 }}</ref>\n\n''The Fall'' is also grounded in the film's historical period. Roy took inspiration for his story's bandits from early 20th century news; the controversy over credit for Charles Darwin's ideas in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' between Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, as well as [[Ota Benga]]'s imprisonment in the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] were prominent news stories around the time period of the film's setting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Singh |first1=Tarsem |title=The Fall- Tarsem's Visual Companion- Part 1: The Director on His Astonishing Imagery |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/exclusive-the-fall-tarsems-visual-companion-part-1/ |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2015}}\nAccording to the director's remarks on the DVD release of the film, Tarsem Singh largely financed the film with his own funds, determined to make the film according to his own vision, and paid members of the cast and crew on an equal basis rather than in more typical Hollywood fashion.\n\nSingh's commentary indicates the film was made over a period of four years and incorporates footage shot in more than 20 countries, including India, Indonesia (Bali), Italy, France, Spain, Namibia, China (PRC), and numerous others, a few of which are not listed in the credits. Singh stressed the importance of on-location filming and lack of special effects in interviews because he found that modern techniques would not age well in comparison. He reportedly only took advertising jobs in places that he wanted to do location scouting for, and would fly out cast members to shoot scenes for the film using the same crew as he did for commercials.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Tarsem Singh's obsession became a movie |url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2008/05/30/tarsem |access-date=30 September 2018 |work=Minnesota Public Radio News |date=30 May 2008}}</ref> Singh's focus on striking visuals combined with his commitment against using special effects when shooting scenes of the blue city in [[Jodhpur]], as he provided locals with blue paint to refresh the paint on their houses.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Tarsem and the legend of \"The Fall\" |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/tarsem-and-the-legend-of-the-fall |access-date=30 September 2018 |work=Rogerebert.com |date=3 June 2008}}</ref> This alternative to post-production effects resulted in the vibrant blue of the city in the film. Another location, the contemporary South African mental hospital which represents an early 20th-century Los Angeles hospital (the principal setting throughout the film) remained operational (in a separate wing) during filming, according to the DVD commentaries.<ref name=commentary />\n\nThe DVD supplementary features reveal that actor Lee Pace remained in a bed for most of the early filming at the director's suggestion, convincing most of the crew that he was in fact unable to walk.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Carpenter |first1=Cassie |title=Style meets substance: director Tarsem Singh brings 'The Fall' to theatres after years in the making |volume=15 |work=Back Stage West |issue=20 |publisher=Prometheus Global Media LLC |date=15 May 2008}}</ref> The intention, Tarsem and Pace noted, was to maximize the realism of Roy's physical limitations in the eyes of Catinca Untaru, whose lines and reactions as the character Alexandria were largely unscripted, and so were young Catinca's spontaneous interactions with Pace's character. For example, Alexandria's misinterpreting the letter E as the number 3 in a note written by Roy came about from an accidental misreading by the 6-year-old actress during filming, which the director then realized he could adapt into a clever twist in the story.\n\nTo further the realism of young Catinca's performance, Tarsem had portions of the hospital scenes between Pace and his young co-star filmed through small holes in the hospital bed curtains, maximizing the youngster's spontaneous interactions with Pace despite the presence of the film crew surrounding them.\n\nThe film features a dream sequence animation created by [[Christoph Lauenstein|Christoph Launstein]] and  [[Wolfgang Lauenstein]].\n\n===Filming locations===\n{{multiple image||total_width=300|direction=vertical\n|image1=28 Abgestorbene B\u00e4ume im Dead Vlei in der Namib-W\u00fcste, fotografiert 1997.jpg\n|image2=ChandBaori.jpg\n|image3=Palace Gardens.jpg\n|footer=Filming locations include [[Deadvlei]], [[Chand Baori]] and [[Umaid Bhawan Palace]]|||Deadvlei|Chand Baori|Umaid Bhawan Palace}}\n<!-- This list should be turned into prose. -->\n* [[Valkenberg Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]\n* [[Deadvlei]] from the [[Sossusvlei]] dune in [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]] in [[Namibia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apanbear.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!C3084ECAB4D13C79!1632.entry |title=The Fall \u2013 Windows Live |publisher=Apanbear.spaces.live.com |access-date=11 August 2010}}</ref>\n* ''The labyrinth'' [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jantar Mantar in Jaipur]]\n* [[Lake Palace|Lake Palace Hotel]] in [[Udaipur]], [[India]]\n* [[Charles Bridge]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]\n* Butterfly reef NE of [[Mana Island, Fiji]] (Coordinates: [https://www.google.com/maps/place/17%C2%B040'20.4%22S+177%C2%B007'54.1%22E/@-17.6723339,177.1295153,951m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0 -17.672339, 177.131704])\n* [[Ubud]], [[Bali]] Island, [[Indonesia]]\n* [[Andaman Islands]] of [[India]]\n* [[Pangong Tso]] in [[Ladakh]], India\n* [[Buland Darwaza]] in the palace complex of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] \n* [[Agra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/puppydogbites/sets/72157594277649442/ |title=The Fall \u2013 a set on Flickr |date=20 July 2004 |publisher=Flickr.com |access-date=11 August 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Magnetic Hill (India)|Magnetic Hill]] in Ladakh, India\n* Moonscape near [[Lamayuru Monastery]] in Ladakh, India\n* [[Gunung Kawi]], [[Bali]] Island, [[Indonesia]]\n* [[Chand Baori]], a large [[stepwell]] in Abhaneri village in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]\n* [[Jodhpur]], the Blue City in [[Rajasthan]]\n* [[Umaid Bhawan Palace]] Lobby, Jodhpur, Rajasthan\n* [[Taj Mahal]], India\n* [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden|Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Buenos Aires]], Argentina\n* [[Buenos Aires Zoo|Jard\u00edn Zool\u00f3gico de Buenos Aires]], Argentina\n* [[Teatro Opera|Teatro Opera Buenos Aires]], Argentina\n* [[Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo|Capitoline Hill]], [[Colosseum]], Roma, Italy\n* [[Hadrian's Villa]], Tivoli, Italy\n* [[Hagia Sophia]], Istanbul, Turkey\n* [[Replicas of the Statue of Liberty#\u00cele aux Cygnes|First Statue of Liberty]] at [[\u00cele aux Cygnes]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]<ref name=commentary>{{cite video |people = [[Tarsem Singh|Singh, Tarsem]] (director) |title = The Fall |medium =  [[Blu-ray Disc|BD]] [[Audio commentary|commentary]] |date = 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Fall'' premiered at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]].
