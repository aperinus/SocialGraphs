Gilliam tried to make the film many times over 29&nbsp;years, which made it an infamous example of [[development hell]].\n\nGilliam started work on the film in 1989 but was unable to secure funding until 1998 when it entered full [[pre-production]] with a budget of $32.1 million without American financing, with [[Jean Rochefort]] as [[Alonso Quijano|Quixote]], [[Johnny Depp]] as Toby Grummett, a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time and [[Vanessa Paradis]] as the female lead. Shooting began in 2000 in [[Navarre]], but difficulties such as sets and equipment being destroyed by flooding, the departure of Rochefort due to illness, problems obtaining [[insurance]] for the production and other financial difficulties led to a sudden suspension of the production and its subsequent cancellation. The original production was the subject of the documentary film ''[[Lost in La Mancha]]'', which was intended to be a [[making-of]] but was released on its own in 2002.\n\nGilliam tried to relaunch production between 2003 and 2016, which included Depp, [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Toby and [[Robert Duvall]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[John Hurt]] as Quixote. All were cancelled for various reasons, such as failing to secure funds, Depp's busy schedule and eventual loss of interest in the project and Hurt being diagnosed with cancer that eventually led to his death. After yet another failed attempt, it was unexpectedly reported in March 2017 that filming had finally started, with [[Adam Driver]], who was confirmed as Toby in 2016 and helped secure funding, and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Quixote. On 4 June 2017, Gilliam announced that the shooting of the film was complete, 17 years after it originally started.\n\n''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote'' premiered on 19 May 2018, simultaneously acting as the closing film at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]] and being released in French theaters. Gilliam faced difficulties in the process of releasing the film worldwide, partially due to a lengthy legal dispute with former producer [[Paulo Branco]]. Subsequently, the film was only released in a few other countries, including Belgium, Spain and Portugal; it was released in the United States and Canada on 10 April 2019 and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 31 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nToby Grummett, a director, is in rural Spain, struggling with the production of a commercial featuring [[Alonso Quijano|Don Quixote]] and [[Sancho Panza]]. After an unsuccessful day of shooting, Toby's superior, the Boss, introduces him to a Romani street merchant who sells him an old DVD of ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote''. By coincidence, Toby wrote and directed the film ten years earlier as a student. Toby watches the film while in bed with the Boss's wife, Jacqui. When the Boss returns to the hotel room, Toby barely escapes without being recognized.\n\nA flashback shows student Toby casting elderly cobbler Javier as Don Quixote. Javier initially falters in his characterization, but upon rushing to defend Angelica when a member of Toby's crew plays a prank on the teenage waitress, succeeds in embodying that \"I am Don Quixote\".\n\nToby realizes that his current shoot is near the shooting location of ''The Man Who Killed Don Quixote''. Taking a motorbike to Los Sue\u00f1os, he learns that Angelica has moved away from her father Raul. Toby meets Javier, now working as a tourist attraction. He discovers that Javier has become convinced that he is the real Don Quixote, and that Toby is his squire, Sancho Panza. Quixote accidentally causes a fire that spreads through the town, as Toby escapes on the motorbike.\n\nOn the set, police are investigating the \"break in\" of Jacqui's room. The police notice that Toby's bike was the one spotted in Los Sue\u00f1os and take him in for questioning. En route, they encounter Don Quixote on his horse Rocinante, who demands that the officers release Toby. When they dismiss him, Quixote attacks, culminating in one of the officers being shot and the Romani man stealing the police car. Quixote supplies Toby with a donkey and clothes from the set, and they set off for adventures.\n\nQuixote notices a windmill and believes it is a giant attacking a woman. Receiving a head wound after being knocked by one of the windmill's blades, Quixote and Toby are led by the woman to a decrepit ruin occupied by impoverished people. The leader, Barbero, welcomes them warmly but locks them in an attic. That night, Toby comes to suspect that they are secretly terrorists, but soon finds that the ruin has transformed into a 17th-century village. Toby manages to evade some guards, then awakens the next morning, the night's events having seemingly been a dream, and learns that the residents are not terrorists but fearful undocumented immigrants. Quixote, having experienced Toby's \"dream\", is regaling them with a tale of it.\n\nMoving on with Quixote, Toby finds a bag of old Spanish gold and attempts to hide it, but accidentally falls down a ravine into a cave. There he re-encounters Angelica, who tells him that she works as an escort. She mounts a horse and rides off, with Toby chasing her.\n\nQuixote finds Toby, and joins him on a quest to find Angelica, but soon enters a jousting match with the \"Knight of Mirrors\", revealed to be Raul. He and several Los Sue\u00f1os townspeople had been disguising themselves in an attempt to get Javier to come home. After Quixote rides off, Raul punches Toby for indirectly causing his daughter to become an escort.\n\nWaking up, Toby finds Quixote whipping himself with thorns to prove his love to [[Dulcinea del Toboso]]. Healing his wounds by a river, Toby is found by Jacqui on horseback, dressed for a costume party thrown by Alexei Miiskin, a Russian vodka company owner entering a business deal with the Boss. Arriving at Miiskin's castle, Toby learns that Angelica is Miiskin's \"property\" and sees him behave cruelly towards Angelica and Quixote. Toby tries to convince both of them to leave but Quixote refuses and Angelica is captured. Toby rescues Angelica, but finds it is Jacqui wearing a mask, who reveals that Angelica is being burned alive by Miiskin as part of his entertainment. Toby accidentally knocks Quixote out of a window; dying on the ground, Quixote gives Toby his sword, telling him that he never truly saw him as lowly. Angelica's burning is shown to be a special effect and Quixote dies while Toby recalls Quixote's claim of immortality.\n\nThe next morning, Toby, now Quixote, attacks three windmills, believing them to be giants, with Angelica at his side. The two agree to call her Sancho Panza and they ride into the sunset.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Toby Grummett, a director who comes back to the village where he filmed his student film ten years ago, and whom Quixote mistakes for his trusted [[squire]] [[Sancho Panza]].<ref name=\"Trailer\"/> [[Robin Williams]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Ewan McGregor]], and [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] were all previously cast in the role.<ref name=\"NeonMagazines\">{{cite web |url=https://neonmagazinescans.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/topten3.jpg|title=Terry Gilliam's ten movies they wouldn't let me make|first=Terry |last=Gilliam |date=1997 |work=[[Neon (magazine)|Neon]] |access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/5/1/17272342/don-quixote-man-who-killed-terry-gilliam-paulo-brasco-cannes-lawsuit|title=The Man Who Killed Don Quixote's long, possibly cursed journey to the big screen, explained|first=Alissa |last=Wilkinson |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=1 May 2018 |access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as \"[[Alonso Quijano|Don Quixote]]\", an old Spanish shoemaker named Javier who played the part of Quixote in Toby's old student film, but has since become convinced he is actually the famous literary character.<ref name=\"Trailer\"/> [[John Cleese]], [[Jean Rochefort]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Duvall]], and [[John Hurt]] were all previously cast in the role;

Instead of a literal adaptation, Gilliam's film was about \"an old, retired, and slightly kooky nobleman named Alonso Quixano [who] reads too many chivalric romances. Taking leave of his senses, he sets out to fix the world and revive chivalry, clad in makeshift armor and accompanied by a donkey-owning farmer named Sancho Panza, who serves as his squire\".\n\nGilliam signed a deal with [[Phoenix Pictures]] as the studio to make the film in 1990 under the name ''Don Quixote''. [[Sean Connery]] was in talks to star as Quixote, but Gilliam disliked the idea because \"Quixote is air and Sean is earth\". [[Nigel Hawthorne]] and [[Danny DeVito]] were also in talks to star as Quixote and Panza respectively.<ref name=\"NeonMagazines\"/><ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/> However, Gilliam ultimately decided that the budget the studio offered him was too low and dropped from the project to focus on ''The Defective Detective'', another film he ultimately failed to make.<ref name=\"NeonMagazines\"/><ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/> Phoenix Pictures chose [[Fred Schepisi]] to replace Gilliam, with [[John Cleese]] as Quixote and [[Robin Williams]] as Panza, and [[Steven Haft]], [[Quincy Jones]] and David Salzman as producers.

Shortly before filming, the crew unexpectedly found out that several actors had conflicting schedules that would not match each other, making it unsure how and when to film scenes that would feature those same actors at the same time.<ref name=\"BBCCursed\"/> On the very first day of shooting, [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] [[fighter aircraft]] flew overhead repeatedly, ruining the audio recording and mandating a later re-dubbing in [[post-production]].<ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/><ref name=\"daze\"/><ref name=\"HeadStuff\"/> A [[flash flood]] then followed on the second day of filming, washing away and destroying significant portions of equipment and changing the color of the barren cliffs, making previously filmed material unusable due to [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues.<ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/><ref name=\"daze\"/><ref name=\"HeadStuff\"/> The crew spent the next days trying to recover the equipment or obtain new supplies, but it eventually turned out that the film's [[insurance]] did not cover the damage caused by the flood.<ref name=\"GuardianMancha\"/> Several actors also did not show up on set for filming.<ref name=\"GuardianMancha\"/>\n\nOn the fifth day, filming resumed, but when Rochefort, an able horseman, attempted to ride and act, he was obviously wincing in pain, and required assistance dismounting and walking; he notably suffered from [[prostate]] issues, which proved very problematic when riding a horse.<ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/><ref name=\"HeadStuff\"/><ref name=\"BBCCursed\"/> This made the newly filmed footage unusable, as Rochefort's pain was obvious on camera, and production was suspended while Rochefort flew hurriedly to his doctor in [[Paris]], where he was additionally diagnosed with a [[Spinal disc herniation|double herniated disc]].<ref name=\"BBCCursed\"/> For several days the crew attempted to shoot scenes that did not involve Rochefort \u2013 including a scene with Depp at [[Monasterio de Piedra]] \u2013 but as time passed, it became unclear whether Rochefort would be able to return or not. Pecorini stated at the time \"Never in 22 years of being in this business have I seen such a sum of bad luck.\"<ref name=\"daze\"/> Gilliam was very disappointed by this, as he had spent two years trying to cast the perfect actor for Quixote.

however, and despite having been warned against working with Branco, Gilliam believed that he had no other choice than to collaborate with him if he wanted ''Don Quixote'' to be filmed in the year, encouraged by Branco's successful financing of [[David Cronenberg]]'s 2012 film ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]''.<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/><ref name=\"Lib\u00e9ration\"/> Similarly, Branco felt that Gilliam had \"a deep hate towards producers\".<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/> Shortly before the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]], Amazon withdrew from the project because of Branco's reputation as producer, with Amazon representative Matthew Heintz sending a mail stating that \"in regard of the interactions we had with [Branco], we do not wish to pursue further negotiations with him\".<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/><ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/> Nevertheless, Gilliam stated during the Cannes Film Festival that the film would start shooting in October 2016.\n\nConflict escalated further when Branco tried to reduce the budget down from the promised 16 million.<ref name=\"VoxPossiblyCursed\"/> He also cut Palin's pay from 285,000 euros to 100,000 euros, which deeply angered Palin; when Gilliam wrote to Branco to complain that Palin's unexpected salary cut felt like a \"slap on the face\", Branco answered that the film needed \"a true producer\", referring to himself as the \"captain\" of the project.<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/> On 29 April 2016, Gilliam signed a deal where in exchange for producing the film, Branco would earn, in addition to his own salary, the salary of 750,000 euros Gilliam would have been paid for writing and directing the film.<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/><ref name=\"BrancoVir\u00e9\"/><ref name=\"Lib\u00e9ration\"/> In addition to severing ties with several other production companies interested in the project, Branco soon tried to reduce the salaries of other crew members, including the hair stylist, the [[assistant director]], and Amy Gilliam.<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/> He also tried to push Palin away from the project, considering him too old, to have his own sister hired as [[costume design]]er, to have filming moved forward by several months, and to have the film shot in [[Digital cinematography|digital]] instead of the [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] Gilliam wanted.<ref name=\"LeMonde\"/> Some of the film's other producers and its distributor stated that Branco told Gilliam \"Either you make this film my way, or you irremediably compromise the feasibility of the project and your film is condemned.

The most notable change was the removal of the time travelling element central to the original 2000 production; instead of the character of Toby being thrown back through time, the film would instead take place in modern times, with the \"period elements\" being characters having a party dressed like in the ancient times. Toby would be revisiting a Spanish village he had once filmed a student film in, and discover that the shoemaker he had cast in the title role all those years ago has been living as Quixote ever since.<ref name=\"BBCCursed\"/>\n\nGilliam stated, \"I'm incorporating the idea of the damage that films do to people, so it's become a bit more autobiographical.\"<ref name=\"BBCCursed\"/> [[Jonathan Pryce]], who was a part of both the original and final productions, stated, \"from what I can remember of the original script, this is an altogether better version.

Gilliam stated, \"Jonathan has been wanting to [play Quixote] for 15 years \u2013 he's been making my life a misery. And now he's here and he's just extraordinary.

Gilliam never shot a frame of the film under the deal with Branco, and as such, the former producer does not own any rights. However, since Gilliam did a poor job of terminating his contract with Branco, there will be a financial settlement that will have to be made between the two parties and the ex-producer has been using this to claim a right to the finished film. Busuievsky went on to say that the latest ruling does say that Gilliam owes \u20ac10,000 and there will probably be more money required to settle. However, these financial issues don't affect the film's release. According to the producer, they chose to remain quiet about the actual major details because it didn't feel necessary, but when Branco went public with his victory and claimed rights to the film, they felt they had to step forward and air all the \"dirty laundry.\" The producer said in 2018 that they were making plans for European territories, with US distribution to follow shortly.
