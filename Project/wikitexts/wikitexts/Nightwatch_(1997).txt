It contained a photo montage of women with their eyes scratched out; as the killer's trademark in the film was to remove the eyes of his victims.<ref name=\"cooper\"/> Cooper then shot these images submerged in water, to give them an added layer of distance and make them ripple spectrally on the screen.<ref name=\"cooper\">{{cite web|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/nightwatch/ |title=Nightwatch (1997) \u2014 Art of the Title |publisher=Artofthetitle.com |access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n''Nightwatch'''s background score was handled by Danish composer Joachim Holbek, who, like many of the crew, was also involved in the original version.<ref name=\"tribute\"/> When ''Nightwatch'' was in the process of being re-edited during 1997, ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' composer [[Marco Beltrami]] was brought in to rescore several scenes.
