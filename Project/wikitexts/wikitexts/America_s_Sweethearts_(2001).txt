It stars [[Julia Roberts]], Crystal, [[John Cusack]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], with [[Hank Azaria]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Seth Green]], [[Alan Arkin]] and [[Christopher Walken]] in smaller roles.\n\n==Plot==\nFilm publicist Lee Phillips ([[Billy Crystal]]) is promoting ''Time Over Time'', a movie featuring beloved husband-and-wife stars Gwen Harrison ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]) and Eddie Thomas ([[John Cusack]]), who have made countless popular films together. However, the eccentric director Hal Weidmann ([[Christopher Walken]]) won't let anyone see the film until its premiere at a [[Movie junket|press junket]], complicating Lee's job. And worse yet: Gwen and Eddie, once dubbed \u201cAmerica's Sweethearts\u201d, have an ugly breakup. \n\nGwen's films without Eddie have been flops. Her affair with co-star Hector Gorzongolas ([[Hank Azaria]]), who now lives with her, nearly drives Eddie to a nervous breakdown. After Gwen's restraining order against him, he moves to a New Age retreat. Lee decides the press must believe the couple are reuniting to promote the film.\n\nLee enlists Kathleen Harrison, nicknamed \u201cKiki\u201d ([[Julia Roberts]]), who is Gwen's sister and personal assistant, to persuade Gwen that attending the junket will benefit her career and public image, where she can also serve Eddie divorce papers. Lee bribes Eddie's spiritual guide ([[Alan Arkin]]) to convince Eddie he can attend.\n\nAt the junket, while Eddie and Gwen are fighting, Lee plants stories to the press they are reconciling. Gwen asks Kiki to be her go-between with Eddie, so they meet secretly to discuss the junket. Eddie's assistant leaks a photo of it to the press.\n\nAngered by the rumors about Gwen and Eddie, Hector shows up, confronts Eddie and knocks him out. As Kiki tends to Eddie, they admit their feelings and have [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. However, in the morning, as they are having [[breakfast]], Gwen calls and Eddie rushes to meet with her.\n\nHurt and angered, Kiki leaves, later becoming furious when Eddie tells Gwen he isn't seeing anyone. Confronting him, she says they can't pursue a relationship because he'll never get over Gwen. Downstairs, Lee tells Kiki not to give up on Eddie as he can see he has feelings for her.\n\nEddie has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] while on the hotel roof, causing the press to believe that he's [[suicide|about to jump]], and inciting Hector and the studio's owner Dave Kingman ([[Stanley Tucci]]) to encourage him in doing so. Gwen is thoroughly humiliated, warning him to stop as she wants maintain to the press that she and Eddie are reconciling. \n\nEddie tells Lee he's in love with Kiki and thinks he's blown it. Lee realizes his mistake, telling Eddie to pursue Kiki and divorce Gwen. Weidmann then shows with the film.\n\nThe screening begins, and everyone discovers that Weidmann abandoned the script, making a \u201creality movie\u201d instead. The footage, mostly shot with hidden cameras and without the actors' knowledge, shows Gwen's unremorseful affair with Hector, gloating about it to then overweight and timid Kiki. Eddie becomes angry about Gwen's clear infidelity, but he otherwise appears sympathetic. Additionally, Dave Kingman is insulted by Weidmann and mocked by his assistant. Hector enjoys the reality film very much, until Gwen insults him about the size of his penis. On the other hand, the film portrays Eddie and Kiki favorably, while Gwen is the antagonist due to her affair with Hector.\n\nAs a result, most of the cast and crew \u2014 particularly Gwen and Kingman \u2014 are offended and confront Weidman, whereas Eddie appears pleased and suggests working together again. Weidmann agrees and reveals he wanted to humiliate Gwen for criticizing his direction. Enraged, she announces she will sue him and Kingman Studios. \n\nKiki is surprised, but not angered by the portrayal of her sister and also pleased to be shown favorably. Hector angrily confronts Gwen for her comments, and Weidmann's daughter, Leaf ([[Keri Lynn Pratt]]), defends him. She reveals their affair, pointing out Gwen's wrong to say he's small.\n\nHumiliated, Gwen announces she is reconciling with Eddie, but he asserts he's finally through with her, and declares his love for Kiki. The latter reciprocates, standing up to Gwen for the first time, and revealing dirty secrets only she knew, before saying she is tired of putting her personal life on hold. Gwen retaliates by coldly firing her, before calming down and declaring she only wants Kiki's happiness, to look better to the press.\n\nOutside, Gwen admits to the press that she and Eddie are over and is in love with Hector. She then claims she's on medication that makes her behave erratically and adding that he is very well-endowed.\n\nKiki and Eddie prepare to leave together to travel and pursue their relationship. Lee arrives to tell them that, amazingly, the press love the movie and Kingman Studios have to release it despite Gwen's lawsuit threat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Kathleen \"Kiki\" Harrison\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Lee Phillips\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Gwen Harrison\n* [[John Cusack]] as Eddie Thomas\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Hector Gorzongolas\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dave Kingman\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Hal Weidmann\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Wellness guide\n* [[Seth Green]] as Danny Wax\n* Scot Zeller as Davis\n* [[Larry King]] as himself\n* [[Steve Pink]] as Limo driver\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Dave O'Hanlon\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Security guard\n* [[Marty Belafsky]] as Security guard\n* [[Keri Lynn Pratt]] as Leaf Weidmann\n* [[Maria Canals-Barrera|Maria Canals]] as Adinah\n* [[Byron Allen]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\nJulia Roberts' niece, [[Emma Roberts]], makes an uncredited appearance as the young girl in the purple T-shirt.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''America's Sweethearts'' opened on July 20, 2001, and earned $30,181,877 in its opening weekend, ranking second behind ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' ($50,771,645).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2001&wknd=29&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for July 20-22, 2001 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=July 23, 2001 | access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref> By the end of its run, the film had grossed $93,607,673 in the domestic box office and $44,583,755 overseas for a worldwide total of $138,191,428.
