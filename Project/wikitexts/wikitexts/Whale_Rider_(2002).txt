Based on the 1987 novel ''[[The Whale Rider]]'' by [[Witi Ihimaera]], the film stars [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]] as Kahu Paikea Apirana, a twelve-year-old [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] girl whose ambition is to become the chief of the tribe. Her [[Grandparent|koro]] Apirana believes that this is a role reserved for males only.\n\nThe film was a coproduction between New Zealand and Germany. It was shot on location in [[Whangara]], the setting of the novel. The world premiere was on 9 September 2002, at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film received critical acclaim upon its release. At age 13, [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]] became [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Best Actress in a Leading Role|the youngest nominee]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] before she was surpassed by [[Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis]], at age 9, for ''[[Beasts of the Southern Wild]]'', in [[85th Academy Awards|2012]], less than a decade later. The film earned $41.4 million<ref name=\"mojo\"/> on a [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]9,235,000 budget. In 2005, the film was named on the BFI ''List of the 50 Films You Should See By the Age of 14''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's plot follows the story of Paikea Apirana (\"Pai\"). The village leader should be the first-born son, a direct [[patrilineal]] descendant of [[Paikea]], the Whale Rider, he who rode on top of a whale (Tohora) from [[Hawaiki]]. Pai is originally born a twin, but her twin brother and her mother died during childbirth. Pai is female and so technically cannot inherit the leadership. While her grandfather, Koro, later forms an affectionate bond with his granddaughter, carrying her to school every day on his bicycle, he also condemns her and blames her for conflicts happening within the tribe.\n\nAfter the death of his wife and despite overwhelming pressure from Koro, Pai's father refuses to assume traditional leadership or finish the [[waka (canoe)]] that he had started building for the baby son; instead, he moves to Germany to pursue a career as an artist. At one point, Paikea decides to live with her father because her grandfather says he doesn't want her. However, as they are driving away, she finds that she cannot bear to leave the sea as the whale seems to be calling her back. Pai tells her father to return her home.\n\nKoro leads a cultural school for the village's first-born boys, hoping to find a new leader. He teaches the boys to use a [[taiaha]] ([[fighting stick]]), which is traditionally reserved for males. Pai is interested in the lessons, but is discouraged and scolded by Koro for doing so. Pai feels that she can become the leader (although no woman has ever done so) and is determined to succeed. Her grandmother, Nanny, tells Pai that her second son, Pai's uncle, had won a taiaha tournament in his youth while he was still slim and so Pai secretly learns from him. She also secretly follows Koro's lessons. One of the students, Hemi, is also sympathetic towards her.\n\nKoro is enraged when he finds out, particularly when she wins a taiaha fight against Hemi. Koro is devastated when none of the boys succeeds at the traditional task of recovering the rei puta (whale tooth) that he threw into the ocean, the mission that would prove one of them worthy of becoming leader. With the loss of the rei puta, Koro in despair calls out the ancient ones, the whales. In an attempt to help, Pai also calls out to them and they hear her call.\n\nOne day Pai, her uncle, her uncle's girlfriend Shilo, and others take the boat to where Koro flung the rei puta into the sea. Pai confidently declares she'll find it and dives into the water. She finds the rei puta, which means that she is the rightful leader. Nanny does not think Koro is ready to accept this and does not tell him. Pai, in an attempt to bridge the rift that has formed, invites Koro to be her guest of honour at a concert of M\u0101ori chants that her school is putting on. Unknown to all, she had won an interschool speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village. However, Koro was late, and as he was walking to the school, he notices that numerous [[southern right whale]]s are beached near Pai's home.\n\nThe entire village attempts to coax and drag them back into the water, but all efforts prove unsuccessful, and even a tractor does not help. Koro sees that as a sign of his failure and despairs further. He admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because she has \"done enough\" damage with her presumption. Also, the largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea.\n\nWhen Koro walks away, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale on the beach and coaxes it to re-enter the ocean. The whale leads the entire pod back into the sea; Pai submerges completely underwater before being thrown off the whale's back by the tide, and the spectators fear she has drowned. At this point, fearing Pai is lost, Nanny reveals to Koro that his granddaughter found the rei puta, and Koro is stunned into realizing the error of his ways. When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro declares her the leader and asks for her forgiveness.\n\nThe film ends with Pai's father, grandparents, and uncle coming together to celebrate her status as the new leader, as the finished waka is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage. In voiceover, Pai declares, \"My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs stretching all the way back to the Whale Rider. I'm not a prophet, but I know that our people will keep going forward, all together, with all of our strength.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]] as Paikea Apirana\n* [[Rawiri Paratene]] as Koro\n* Vicky Haughton as Nanny Flowers\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Porourangi\n* Grant Roa as Uncle Rawiri\n* Mana Taumaunu as Hemi\n* [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]] as Shilo\n* Taungaroa Emile as Willie\n* [[Tammy Davis]] as Dog\n* Mabel Wharekawa as Maka (as Mabel Wharekawa-Burt)\n* Rawinia Clarke as Miro\n* Tahei Simpson as Miss Parata\n* Roi Taimana as Hemi's Dad (as Roimata Taimana)\n* Elizabeth Skeen as Rehua\n* Tyronne White as Jake (as Tyrone White)\n* Taupua Whakataka-Brightwell as Ropata\n* Tenia McClutchie-Mita as Wiremu\n* Peter Patuwai as Bubba\n* Rutene Spooner as Parekura\n* Riccardo Davis as Maui\n* Apiata Whangaparita-Apanui as Henare\n* John Sumner as Obstetrician\n* Sam Woods as Young Rawiri\n* Pura Tangira as Ace\n* Jane O'Kane as Anne\n* Aumuri Parata-Haua as Baby Paikea\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Whangara panorama.jpg|thumb|right|The community of [[Whangara]], where the film is set]]\nThe film had budget of NZ$9,235,000.<ref name=\"nzfc\">{{cite press release |title = Film Fund 1 Interim Report |url = http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/getattachment/ca1ca4b3-ec45-4bc9-bbd2-fab47679da78/Film_Fund_1_Interim_Report_(1).aspx?disposition=attachment |publisher = [[New Zealand Film Commission]] |date = 18 May 2009 |access-date = 5 July 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100602015536/http://www.nzfilm.co.nz/getattachment/ca1ca4b3-ec45-4bc9-bbd2-fab47679da78/Film_Fund_1_Interim_Report_(1).aspx?disposition=attachment |archive-date = 2 June 2010 |url-status = dead}}<!-- To open archive URL file download, file extension must be changed to .pdf --></ref> It received $2.5 million from the New Zealand Film Production Fund.<ref name=\"nzfc\" /> Additional financing came from ApolloMedia, Filmstiftung NRW, the [[New Zealand Film Commission]] and [[New Zealand On Air|NZ On Air]].<ref name=\"tor\">{{cite press release |title = Whale Rider To Debut in Toronto |url = http://www.whaleriderthemovie.co.nz/articles/press2.html |publisher = [[South Pacific Pictures]] |date = 5 July 2010 |access-date = 5 July 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100603172336/http://www.whaleriderthemovie.co.nz/articles/press2.html |archive-date = 3 June 2010 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Casting director Diana Rowan visited numerous schools to find an actress to play Pai. 10,000 children were auditioned before narrowing it down to 12.
