The film stars [[Jeffrey Combs]] as John Reilly, an American recovering alcoholic who inherits an Italian castle when a distant relative passes away. John stays at the castle with his estranged wife Susan ([[Barbara Crampton]]) and blind daughter Rebecca (Jessica Dollarhide), but a freakish monster locked away in the basement (Jonathan Fuller) escapes and commits a series of murders.\n\n''Castle Freak'' went into production in 1994 after Gordon noticed art for the film in producer [[Charles Band]]'s office. Gordon agreed to develop the film on Band's condition that the film take place in a castle, contain a freak, and would be shot on a very low budget. Gordon obliged as he would be able to cast who he wanted in the film and would get the final cut. The film was shot in 1994 in a castle owned by Band in Italy, where Gordon had previously shot ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1991 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]''. The film was shot during a period when [[Full Moon Features]] was having financial issues and was released to little press on home video in November 1995.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter inheriting a 12th-century castle which belonged to a famed [[Duchess]] in [[Italy]], John Reilly, his wife Susan, and their blind teenage daughter Rebecca travel to Italy to visit. Susan blames John for the death of their five-year-old son in a [[drunk driving]] accident which also cost their daughter her [[eyesight]]. On the advice of the estate's [[executor]], the three plan to stay at the [[castle]] until they can liquidate the estate. Unbeknownst to them, the Duchess' son, Giorgio Orsino, who was imprisoned and tortured by the Duchess, still lives in the [[dungeon]]s of the castle.\n\nAfter killing and eating a cat, the [[disfigured]] Giorgio escapes by breaking off his own thumb to get out of the [[manacle]]s which bind him. Giorgio begins to roam the castle, prowling around the bedroom of the terrified Rebecca. When she claims there is someone else in the house, John believes her, but Susan does not. John, still wracked with guilt about the death of his son, turns to drinking alcohol and hires a [[prostitute]] who doesn't speak English from the nearby town, angering Susan further for [[infidelity|cheating]]. As she leaves the castle, the prostitute is ambushed and horribly mutilated by Giorgio. The maid discovers the still-living prostitute before she herself is murdered. Susan plans to leave with Rebecca, but the police order them to stay while they investigate the missing prostitute.\n\nJohn learns that Giorgio is his half-brother and that the Duchess was his father's first wife. The Duchess chained Giorgio up and tortured him all of his life because her husband abandoned her and their son for her sister (John's mother) and went to [[America]]. The police arrest John upon discovering the bodies of the [[maid]] and the prostitute. Susan and Rebecca stay the night in the castle, praying together for forgiveness for John. Giorgio kills two policemen, then abducts Rebecca and chains her up in his cell. Susan learns of Giorgio's weakness and seduces him. This distracts Giorgio long enough for Susan to rescue her daughter and stab Giorgio, making him angry. Determined to save his family, John escapes the police station after a fight with a policeman. He comes to the castle, fighting Giorgio on the roof. He sacrifices his own life to pull Giorgio off the roof and kill him as well. Susan tearfully forgives John and they reaffirm their love as he dies. The son of the prostitute is seen with the policeman (who is the boy's father) at John's funeral.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as John Reilly\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Susan Reilly\n* Jonathan Fuller as Giorgio (the Freak)\n* Jessica Dollarhide as Rebecca Reilly\n* Massimo Sarchielli as Giannetti\n* Elisabeth Kaza as Agnese\n* [[Luca Zingaretti]] as Agent Forte\n* Helen Stirling as Duchess D'Orsino\n* Raffaella Offidani as Sylvana\n}}\n\n==Production==\nWhile preparing to work on ''[[Space Truckers]]'', director [[Stuart Gordon]]  received the opportunity to develop ''Castle Freak''.<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Gordon was in [[Charles Band]]'s office and noticed a poster entitled ''Castle Freak'', with a [[Quasimodo]]-like man chained to a wall being whipped by a woman.<ref name=\"scifi\">{{Cite book |title=Science Fiction Film Directors, 1895\u20131998 |last=Fischer |first=Dennis |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |isbn=9780786485055 |pages=256}}</ref> When Gordon asked about it, Band replied, \"Well, that's a castle and there's a freak.\"<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Band said he had no script, but if Gordon wanted it, he could do whatever he wanted with the idea as long as he maintained the concepts of a castle and a freak.<ref name=\"scifi\" /> Gordon made the film for about $500,000<ref name=\"scifi\" /> When asked why he was prompted to make another low-budget film, Gordon responded that it would be his first film since ''[[Re-Animator]]'' that he could release without a rating, he would be given final cut on the film, and he had the ability to cast whoever he wanted, stating, \"Even though the budget was tiny, I had complete control.\"<ref name=\"scifi\" />\n\nSpeaking about the film's influences, [[Daniele Massaccesi]], who was part of the crew, stated that, \"''Castle Freak'' is full of Lovecraftian references [...] although the director may argue this point of view.\"<ref name=\"cf-31\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|title=The Castle Freak Awakens|last=Curci|first=Loris|page=31|issue=148|date=November 1995}}</ref> Gordon stated that both himself and screenwriter [[Dennis Paoli]] took influence from the short story \"[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]\".

It\u2019s scary, gruesome and disturbing. It\u2019s excellently acted by Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. The cinematography, location, gore and special effects are outstanding. The creature design is awful (in a good way). Stuart Gordon\u2019s direction is, of course, great. The plot with Reilly\u2019s blind daughter seems somewhat obvious, but thankfully it doesn\u2019t take as distasteful a turn as the one with the prostitute.
