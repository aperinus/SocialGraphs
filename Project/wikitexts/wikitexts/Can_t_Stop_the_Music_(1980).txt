Written by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Bronte Woodard|Bront\u00e9 Woodard]], the film is a pseudo-[[biography]] of the 1970s [[disco]] group the [[Village People]] loosely based on the actual story of how the group formed. Produced by [[Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment]] (formerly EMI Films), distributed by [[Independent film|independent]] distributor [[Associated Film Distribution]] (AFD), the film was released after disco's peak<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/2766092/erics-bad-movies-cant-stop-the-music-1980/ Eric's Bad Movies: Can't Stop the Music (1980) - MTV]</ref> and, along with ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', is known for inspiring the creation of the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning the first Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay.<ref name=\"germain\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nSongwriter Jack Morell\u2014a reference to Village People creator [[Jacques Morali]]\u2014gets a break [[Disc jockey|DJ]]ing at local [[Discotheque|disco]] Saddle Tramps. His roommate, Samantha \"Sam\" Simpson, is a [[supermodel]] newly retired at the peak of her success. She sees the response to a song that he wrote for her (\"Samantha\") and agrees to use her connections to get him a record deal. Her connection is her ex-boyfriend Steve Waits, president of [[Marrakech]] Records\u2014a reference to Village People record label [[Casablanca Records]]\u2014who is more interested in rekindling their romantic relationship than in Jack's music (and more interested in taking business calls than in wooing Samantha), but agrees to listen to a [[Demo (music)|demo]].\n\nDeeming Jack's vocals as inadequate, Sam recruits neighbor and Saddle Tramps waiter/[[Go-go dancer|go-go boy]] [[Felipe Rose]] (the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]), fellow model [[David Hodo|David \"Scar\" Hodo]] (the construction worker, who daydreams of stardom in the solo number \"I Love You to Death\"), and finds [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] (the cowboy) on the streets of [[Greenwich Village]], offering dinner in return for their participation. Meanwhile, Sam's former agent, Sydney Channing, orders [[Girl Friday (idiom)|Girl Friday]] Lulu Brecht to attend, hoping to lure back the star. Ron White, a lawyer from [[St. Louis]], is mugged by an elderly woman on his way to deliver a cake that Sam's sister sent and arrives disconcerted. Brecht gives Jack [[Recreational drugs|drugs]], which unnerves him when her friend Alicia Edwards brings singing cop [[Ray Simpson]] (the policeman), but Jack records the quartet on \"[[Can't Stop the Music (album)|Magic Night]]\". Ron, pawed all night by the man-hungry Brecht, is overwhelmed by the [[culture shock]] of it all and leaves.\n\nThe next day, Sam runs into Ron, who apologizes, proffers the excuse that he is a [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] and follows her home. Spilling leftover lasagna on himself, Sam and Jack help him remove his trousers before Jack leaves and Sam and Ron [[Sexual intercourse|spend the night]]. Newly interested in helping, Ron offers his [[Wall Street]] office to hold auditions. There, [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn M. Hughes]] (the [[Leather subculture|leatherman]]), climbs atop a piano for a rendition of \"[[Danny Boy]]\", and he and [[Alex Briley]] (the [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]) join the group, now a [[sextet]]. They get their name from an offhand remark by Ron's socialite mother Norma. Ron's boss, Richard Montgomery, overwhelmed by the carnival atmosphere, insists that the firm not represent the group, and Ron quits.\n\nRon's new idea for rehearsal space is the [[YMCA]] (the ensuing production number \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|YMCA]]\" features its athletic denizens in various states of undress; the film is one of the few [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|non-R-rated]] offerings to feature full-frontal male [[nudity]]). The group cuts a demo (\"''Liberation''\") for Marrakech, but Steve sees limited appeal and Sam refuses his paltry contract. Reluctant to use her savings, they decide to self-finance by throwing a pay-party.\n\nTo bankroll the party, Sam acquiesces to Channing's plea to return for a TV advertising campaign for milk, provided the Village People are featured. The lavish number \"Milkshake\" begins as Sam pours milk for six little boys in the archetypal costumes with the promise that they will grow up to be the Village People. The advertisers want nothing to do with such a concept, and refuse to broadcast the spot. Norma then steps in to invite the group to debut at her charity fundraiser in [[San Francisco]]. Sam lures Steve by promising a romantic weekend, but the inference that she would proceed with the seduction takes Ron aback, and Sam ends their romantic relationship. On his private jet, Steve prepares for a tryst, but rather Jack and his former [[Showgirl|chorine]] mother Helen arrive to negotiate a contract. Initially reluctant, Helen wins over Steve with her [[kreplach]], and eventually they are negotiating the T-shirt merchandising for the Japanese market.\n\nIn the dressing room before the show, Ron, relieved to learn that Sam did not travel with Steve, [[Marriage proposal|proposes]] to her. At one point, Montgomery appears, seeking to rehire Ron as a junior partner representing the group. Following a set by [[The Ritchie Family]] (\"Give Me a Break\"), the Village People triumphantly debut (\"[[Can't Stop the Music (song)|Can't Stop the Music]]\").\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Jack Morell\n* [[Valerie Perrine]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Simpson\n* [[Caitlyn Jenner]]{{efn|name=a}} as Ron White\n* [[Paul Sand]] as Steve Waits\n* [[Tammy Grimes]] as Sydney Channing\n* [[Village People]]:\n** [[Alex Briley]] as Alex the G.I.\n** [[David Hodo]] as David the Construction Worker\n** [[Glenn Hughes (Village People)|Glenn Hughes]] as Glenn the Leatherman\n** [[Randy Jones (singer)|Randy Jones]] as Randy the Cowboy\n** [[Felipe Rose]] as Felipe the Indian\n** [[Ray Simpson]] as Ray the Policeman\n* [[June Havoc]] as Helen Morell\n* [[Barbara Rush]] as Norma White\n* [[Altovise Davis]] as Alicia Edwards\n* [[Marilyn Sokol]] as Lulu Brecht\n* [[Russell Nype]] as Richard Montgomery\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Benny Murray\n* [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Claudia Walters\n* Dick Patterson as the Record store manager\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOriginally titled ''Discoland...

After establishing the character, Walker directed some episodes of both series, along with episodes of other sitcoms. ''Can't Stop the Music'' was her lone effort at theatrical film direction, as after it, Walker returned to acting in television.\n\n===Casting===\nThe film's supporting cast includes Tammy Grimes, [[Russell Nype]], [[June Havoc]], [[Altovise Davis]], [[Jack Weston]] and [[Leigh Taylor-Young]]. Chita Rivera and Pat Ast were initially cast but dropped out of the film's production.<ref name=\"disco\"/>\n\n''Can't Stop the Music'' was Caitlyn Jenner's film debut (as Bruce Jenner), after becoming famous for three world record-setting performances in the [[Decathlon]], and a [[Gold medal]] win at the 1976 [[Olympic Games]]. Jenner's record stood from 1975 until shortly before this film's 1980 release. Jenner did not appear in another film until [[Adam Sandler]]'s ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'' (2011), which, like ''Can't Stop the Music'', won the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]]. Carr said, \"Jenner is going to be the [[Robert Redford]] of the 80s, and this film will do for Valerie what ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' did for [[Ann-Margret]].\"<ref name=\"disco\"/>\n\nThe Village People auditionees depicted in the film included [[Blackie Lawless]] (a member of the [[Glam rock|glam]]-[[Punk rock|punk]] group [[New York Dolls]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] group [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]) and James Marcel (who would later find greater success with the name [[James Wilder (actor)|James Wilder]]). Background dancers included Perri Lister, girlfriend of [[Billy Idol]] and mother to his son, and Peter Tramm, who would go on to appear in dozens of [[music video]]s and double for [[Kevin Bacon]] in ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.\n\nRay Simpson's role was originally intended for [[Victor Willis]], the original lead singer of the Village People who left the group during pre-production of this film. Morali had hired Willis' then-wife, [[Phylicia Rashad|Phylicia Ayers-Allen]], to portray his girlfriend. When Willis left the group, Ayers-Allen quit the movie and was replaced by Altovise Davis.\n\n\"This movie's a revolution,\" said Carr. \"I mean this movie is launching whole new careers and we need new stars today.

Another reference to one of the band's songs, \"[[San Francisco (You've Got Me)]],\" appears in the opening credits, as Jack passes a group of three women with the words \"San Francisco\" printed on their T-shirts.\n\nThe band's silver and white costumes in the \"Milkshake\" sequence and red costumes in the finale sequences were designed by [[Theoni V.
