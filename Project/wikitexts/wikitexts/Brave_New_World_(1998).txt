She conceived it the night that John Savage fell to his death. She did not use her birth control that night. Bernard suggests that she say it was an accident and have an abortion, but she makes it clear that she will not, and so prefers banishment.\n\nBernard lets her go \u2013 secretly \u2013 and takes the job he has aspired to throughout his career, but he is soon unhappy, and no amount of Soma can change that. He has seen and learned to appreciate genuine emotions and human experiences thanks to knowing John, as has Lenina. As a result, Bernard follows Lenina into exile from society.\n\nDirector Mustapha Mond looks for Bernard at their scheduled meeting, and is handed a note. The messenger explains that Bernard got away from society by authorizing a trip for himself. Mond laughs out loud to himself, indicating that he will not pursue them. The final scene shows a beach with Lenina and Bernard. They appear to be playing with their natural born daughter on the shore.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Bernard Marx\n* [[Rya Kihlstedt]] as Lenina Crowne\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as John Cooper\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Linda\n* [[Leonard Nimoy]] as Mustapha Mond<ref>{{cite web |title=Brave new world 1998 |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/brave-new-world-1998.html |website=[[Alamy]] |access-date=23 August 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as Ingram\n* Steven Schub as a Beta Clerk\n* [[Aron Eisenberg]] as Male Panelist\n* Tina Sanchez as a Beta Reporter\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Caryn James said:\"The film fails to deal coherently with what is frightening about modern life and why\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=James |first1=Caryn |title=TV WEEKEND; It's New, but Is It Brave?
