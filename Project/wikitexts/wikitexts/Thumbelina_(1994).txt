The film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing only $17 million dollars against its $28 million dollar budget, and received mixed to negative reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news |title=(Movie listings) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/521452534/?terms=%22thumbelina%22 |access-date=December 15, 2019 |work=[[The Capital Times]] |issue=92 |volume=154 |date=March 29, 1994 |location=Madison, WI |page=3D |quote=Thumbelina \u2013 starts tomorrow [March 30] |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=\"LAT-19940330\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nA lonely widow longing for a child of her own is given a [[barley]] seed by a friendly [[Witchcraft|witch]]. The planted seed grows into a flower, and a tiny girl emerges from inside, no bigger than the old woman's thumb. The old woman names the tiny girl Thumbelina and raises her as her own. Although Thumbelina loves her mother, she craves companionship from someone her own size. One night, the [[fairy]] prince Cornelius stumbles upon Thumbelina after hearing her singing. The two take a ride on Cornelius' [[bumblebee]] and fall in love. During this ride, Mrs. Toad and her son Grundel are enchanted by Thumbelina's singing. That night, Mrs. Toad kidnaps Thumbelina, desiring her to join their show troupe and marry Grundel. Thumbelina is rescued by Jacquimo, a [[Swallow (bird)|swallow]]. Meanwhile, Cornelius learns of her kidnapping and returns to his kingdom, the Vale of the Fairies, to ask his parents to try holding back the winter as long as they can, but they can only hold it for a day.\n\nGrundel learns that Thumbelina escaped, and ventures out to find her. While trying to get home, Thumbelina is ambushed by Berkeley Beetle, who promises to show her the way home if she sings at his Beetle Ball. She reluctantly complies, but her bug disguise falls off during the concert and she is denounced as \"ugly\" as well as being publicly humiliated in front of the audience. Beetle rejects her without helping her. She is next found by Jacquimo, who promises to find Cornelius. Beetle is confronted by Grundel and suggests that Grundel kidnap Cornelius and use him as bait to lure Thumbelina. Grundel coerces Beetle into partnership by removing his wings.\n\nUpon the arrival of winter, Jacquimo injures his wing and loses consciousness from the extreme cold, while Cornelius falls into a pond by wind and is frozen. Beetle finds Cornelius' frozen body and takes him to Grundel. Thumbelina is forced to take refuge in an old shoe, where she is discovered by Miss Fieldmouse and granted shelter in her underground house. After relaying Cornelius' fate to her, Miss Fieldmouse introduces her to her neighbor Mr. Mole, who becomes infatuated with her and desires to marry her. Devastated by the apparent loss of Cornelius, Thumbelina gives in to hopelessness and accepts Mr. Mole's proposal. Jacquimo revives and, before Thumbelina can get a chance to explain to him what happened to Cornelius, resolves to find him before the wedding.\n\nBeetle tells Grundel of Thumbelina's wedding. When they leave Cornelius behind, a trio of friendly [[insect]] children find and thaw Cornelius. At the wedding, Thumbelina finds herself unable to marry Mr. Mole after remembering Cornelius' promise to always love her. Grundel and Beetle arrive, and a chase ensues. Cornelius also arrives and engages Grundel in a fight, which culminates with the two falling into a [[chasm]]. Thumbelina escapes on a pile of Mr. Mole's treasure, causing it to fall at Mr. Mole and the wedding guests. Jacquimo finds the Vale of the Fairies and takes Thumbelina there. She and Cornelius reunite, and she magically grows her own pair of wings upon accepting his proposal and kissing him. With her mother and the fairy court in attendance, the two marry and depart on Cornelius' bumblebee.\n\nThe credits images reveal that Beetle's wings regrew and he resumed his [[Pop music|pop]] career; Grundel survived the fall with a broken leg and married a female [[toad]] to his mom's delight, and Mr. Mole married Miss Fieldmouse.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Jodi Benson]] as [[Thumbelina]], a tiny young girl who is not as big as her adoptive mother's thumb, and falls in love with the handsome fairy prince Cornelius.\n* [[Gary Imhoff]] as Prince Cornelius, the Prince of the Fairies and Thumbelina's love interest.\n* [[Joe Lynch (actor)|Joe Lynch]] as Grundel Toad, a lustful [[toad]] in love with Thumbelina\n* [[Gino Conforti]] as Jacquimo, a wise [[swallow]] who speaks with a [[French language|French]] accent.

''Thumbelina'' was the first, followed by ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'', and the third, a retelling of the story of [[Rapunzel]], in which Manilow would also have a voice role, was canceled. The film's soundtrack was released for a limited time and has since gone out of print. \"Marry the Mole\" won a [[Razzie]] for Worst Original Song.\n\n== Production and release ==\n''Thumbelina'' was in production from February 1991 to May 1993 at Don Bluth Ireland Ltd.

However, by the time it was completed, both companies dropped the arrangement due to concerns about the bankruptcy of Bluth's studio. During Sullivan Bluth's bankruptcy proceedings, the court trustee presented the film to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] film distribution unit, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]. The trustee ultimately declined Disney's offer to distribute the film as they were also trying to find a new owner for the studio.<ref>{{cite web |title=Behind the Scenes |url=http://donbluth.com |website=Don Bluth Films |access-date=22 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302051459/http://www.donbluth.com/flm/behindscs.html |archive-date=March 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Warner Bros.
