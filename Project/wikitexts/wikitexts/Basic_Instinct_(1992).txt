Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[erotic thriller]] film directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]] and written by [[Joe Eszterhas]]. The film follows [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]] police detective Nick Curran ([[Michael Douglas]]), who is investigating the brutal murder of a wealthy [[Celebrity|rock star]]. During the investigation, Curran becomes involved in a torrid and intense relationship with the prime suspect, [[Catherine Tramell]] ([[Sharon Stone]]), an enigmatic writer.\n\nEszterhas developed the script in the 1980s. It became a subject of a bidding war until [[Carolco Pictures]] acquired the rights to the film. From there, Verhoeven signed on to direct and Douglas and Stone joined the project, after many actresses were considered for the role of Tramell. Before its release, ''Basic Instinct'' generated controversy due to its overt sexuality and violence, including a rape scene. Gay rights activists criticized the film's depiction of homosexual relationships and the portrayal of a bisexual woman as a murderous [[psychopath]].<ref>{{cite journal  | last1 = Leistedt | first1 = Samuel J. | last2 = Linkowski |first2 = Paul | title = Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction? | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2014 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 167\u2013174 | doi = 10.1111/1556-4029.12359 | pmid=24329037| s2cid = 14413385 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|title=Dr. Fredricks Cinema Therapy Blog - Narcissistic personality disorder|publisher=Dr. Randi Fredricks, PhD|access-date=2014-04-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915022411/http://psychitect.com/blogfilm/archives.cfm/category/narcissistic-personality-disorder|archive-date=September 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In one scene, Stone's [[vulva]] was filmed as she crossed her legs, which she claimed was done without her knowledge, a claim denied by the director.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Owoseje|first=Toyin|date=2021-03-20|title=Sharon Stone says she was misled about explicit interrogation scene in 'Basic Instinct': Vanity Fair|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/sharon-stone-says-she-was-misled-about-explicit-interrogation-scene-in-basic-instinct-vanity-fair-1.5355419|access-date=2021-03-21|website=CTVNews|language=en|archive-date=March 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320155149/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/sharon-stone-says-she-was-misled-about-explicit-interrogation-scene-in-basic-instinct-vanity-fair-1.5355419|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Basic Instinct 2006\"/>\n\n''Basic Instinct'' premiered in Los Angeles on March 18, 1992, and was released in the United States by [[TriStar Pictures]] on March 20, 1992.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url = https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59185-BASIC-INSTINCT?cxt=filmography|title = Basic Instinct|website = AFI Catalog of Feature Films|publisher = [[American Film Institute]]|access-date = July 28, 2019|archive-date = June 9, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190609021521/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59185-BASIC-INSTINCT?cxt=filmography|url-status = live}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of its cast, original score, and editing, but criticized its writing and character development.

Nick's only suspect is Boz's girlfriend, crime novelist Catherine Tramell, who has written a novel that mirrors the crime. It is concluded that either Catherine is the murderer or someone is attempting to frame her. Catherine is uncooperative and taunting during the investigation, smoking and exposing herself during her interrogation. She passes a lie detector test and is released. Nick discovers Catherine has a history of befriending murderers, including her girlfriend Roxy, who impulsively killed her two younger brothers when she was 16 years of age, and Hazel Dobkins, who killed her husband and children for no apparent reason.\n\nNick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine during an undercover assignment, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he has an on-and-off affair. Nick discovers that Catherine is basing the protagonist of her latest book on him, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Nick suspects that Catherine has bribed Lt. Marty Nielsen of Internal Affairs for information from Nick's psychiatric file and that Beth had previously given it to Nielsen after he threatened to recommend Nick's termination. Nick assaults Nielsen in his office, and later becomes a prime suspect when Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when his behavior deteriorates, he is put on leave.\n\nNick and Catherine begin a torrid affair with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. Nick arrives at a club and witnesses Catherine doing cocaine with Roxy and another man. Nick and Catherine dance and make out, and are later observed by Roxy, having violent sex in Catherine's bed. Catherine ties Nick to the headboard with a white silk scarf, just as Boz was tied by the mystery blonde, but does not kill him. Roxy, jealous of Nick, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car, but dies when the car crashes. Catherine grieves over Roxy's death and tells Nick about a previous lesbian encounter at college that went awry. She claims that the girl became obsessed with her, causing Nick to believe that Catherine may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth, who acknowledges the encounter, but she claims it was Catherine who became obsessed. Additionally, Nick discovers that a college professor of Beth and Catherine's was also killed with an ice pick in an unsolved homicide, and that the events inspired one of Catherine's early novels.\n\nNick comes across the final pages of Catherine's book in which the fictional detective finds his partner's body in an elevator. Catherine then breaks off their affair, causing Nick to become upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus Moran, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at an office building, hoping to reveal what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is stabbed to death with an ice pick in the elevator. Recalling the last pages of Catherine's book, Nick runs into the building, only to find Gus' body in a manner similar to the scene described. Beth unexpectedly arrives and explains that she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects Beth has murdered Gus and, believing that she is reaching for a gun, shoots her, but discovers that Beth was only fiddling with an ornament on her key chain.\n\nEvidence collected at the scene and in Beth's apartment implicates her as the killer of Boz, Nielsen, Moran, and her own husband, along with collections of photos and newspaper clippings of Catherine that imply an obsession with her. Nick is left confused and dejected. He returns to his apartment where Catherine meets him. She explains her reluctance to commit to him, as, people she cares about keep dying; but then, the two have sex. As they discuss their future, an ice pick is revealed to be under the bed.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Detective Nick Curran\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as [[Catherine Tramell]]\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Detective Gus Moran\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Dr. Beth Garner\n* [[Denis Arndt]] as Lieutenant Phillip Walker\n* [[Leilani Sarelle]] as Roxanne \"Roxy\" Hardy\n* [[Bruce A.

This was followed by a DVD release in 1997, in a \"barebones\" format that contained the R-rated version. A Collector's Edition was released on DVD in 2001, containing the uncut version of the film with a commentary by [[Camille Paglia]] and a small ice-pick (the villain's weapon of choice).

The missing or censored material (later released on video and DVD unrated as the ''director's cut'') included:\n* The murder of Johnny Boz in the opening scene. In the director's cut, the killer is seen stabbing him in his neck, in the chest, and through his nose. In addition, the killer is still having violent sex with him while stabbing him at the same time.\n* The scene where Nick has sex with Beth is cut in the US theatrical version, as he is seen ripping off her clothes and forcing her over the couch, before a cut to the two of them lying on the floor. In the uncut version they are seen having rougher sex.\n* The scene where Nick and Tramell have sex after going to the club is longer and much more explicit in the uncut version.\n\nThe film was released in the UK by [[StudioCanal UK|StudioCanal]] on restored [[4K Ultra HD]] Collector's Edition, a remastered Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on June 14, 2021. The film will also be released in Australia on July 7 and New Zealand on July 14, 2021. Restoration was done during 2019 and 2020 from the original 35MM negative and supervised by the director.
