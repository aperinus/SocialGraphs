The prisoners' escape committee, the \"X\" Organization, led by \"Big X\", [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Squadron Leader]] Roger Bartlett, a former prisoner of the [[Gestapo]], and with the support of senior British officer [[Group Captain]] Ramsey, mount an audacious plan to tunnel out of the camp and break out 250 men \u2013 not just to escape, but so that German manpower will be wasted on finding POWs. The men organize into teams, simultaneously working on three tunnels, [[Tom, Dick and Harry|\"Tom\", \"Dick\", and \"Harry\"]].\n\n[[Eagle Squadron|American]] [[Flight Lieutenant]] Bob Hendley can find anything, from a camera to identity cards. [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australian]] [[Flying Officer]] Sedgwick makes tools like picks and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenants Danny Velinski and Willie Dickes are in charge of digging the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Andy MacDonald, Bartlett's second-in-command, gathers and provides intelligence.\n\n[[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|Lieutenant Commander]] Eric Ashley-Pitt of the [[Royal Navy]] devises a method of hiding dirt from the tunnels under the guards' noses. Flight Lieutenant Griffith creates civilian outfits from scavenged cloth for the POWs to wear after the escape. Dai Nimmo and Haynes are in charge of diverting the guards' attention to other things in the camp in order to pull off the more risky parts of the operation unnoticed. Sorren is in charge of security.\n\nForging papers to get to freedom is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe. The work noise is covered by the prisoner choir led by Flight Lieutenant Dennis Cavendish, who also does surveys to measure the tunnel.\n\nOn June 20, 1943, Bartlett asks [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Virgil Hilts, who is attempting escapes with Scottish Flying Officer Archie Ives RAF but being constantly imprisoned in solitary confinement in the \"cooler\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside Tunnel \"Harry\" |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/harr-nf.html |website=Nova: Great Escape |publisher=PBS Online |access-date=2 February 2020 |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202014814/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/harr-nf.html |url-status=live }}</ref> to help in the escape by getting out through the barbed wire, scouting out the area, and then allowing himself to be recaptured; Hilts refuses.\n\nBartlett orders \"Dick\" and \"Harry\" sealed off, as \"Tom\" is closest to completion. After hoarding potatoes, Hilts, Hendley and American Second Lieutenant Goff concoct [[moonshine]] from a home made still and celebrate the [[Fourth of July]] with the entire camp. In the midst of the celebration, the guards discover \"Tom\". As the POWs react with dismay, a despondent Ives frantically climbs the barbed wire fence and is shot dead.\n\nHilts volunteers to provide reconnaissance from outside the camp and Bartlett switches the prisoners' efforts to \"Harry\", after the information Hilts brings back is used to create maps to guide the escapers. After experiencing a tunnel collapse, a [[claustrophobic]] Danny tries to break out through the fence but agrees to try the tunnel when Willie promises his support.\n\nBlythe discovers that he is going blind due to progressive [[myopia]];<ref group=\"note\">{{cite web |url=https://aapos.org/glossary/progressive-high-myopia |title=Progressive (High) Myopia |website=American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus |quote=\"Progressive myopia\", also known as degenerative myopia, is a condition that often begins in childhood. |access-date=January 8, 2020 |archive-date=September 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928092020/https://aapos.org/glossary/progressive-high-myopia |url-status=live }}</ref> Hendley takes it upon himself to be Blythe's guide in the escape.\n\nThe last part of the tunnel is completed on the scheduled night, March 24, 1944, and despite some mishaps, such as the tunnel being {{convert|20|ft|0}} short, 76 prisoners, including Bartlett, MacDonald, Hendley, Blythe, Hilts, Ashley-Pitt, Danny, Willie, Sedgwick, Cavendish, Nimmo and Haynes, escape out the tunnel, aided by Hilts using 30 feet of rope as a guide, and an air-raid blackout.\n\nCavendish slips and falls after exiting the tunnel, which leads to him drawing a guard's attention and nearly being caught. However, the escape attempts ultimately end when an impatient Griffith exits the tunnel in view of a guard, and is captured immediately.\n\nThe 76 POWs flee through the Third Reich. Cavendish hitch hikes in a truck but is delivered to the authorities where he finds Haynes, disguised as a German soldier, captured. Hendley and Blythe steal a plane to fly over the Swiss border, but the engine fails, and they crash-land; Blythe is shot and dies, while Hendley is recaptured.\n\nHilts steals a motorcycle at a crossroads, heading for the German-Swiss border to escape pursuing German soldiers. He begins jumping barbed-wire fences but soldiers shoot out the bike's tire, and he is recaptured. Ashley-Pitt is shot and killed at a railway station when he causes a distraction to save MacDonald and Bartlett but they are recaptured after a Gestapo officer tricks them into speaking English.\n\nOn the orders of Adolf Hitler, the Gestapo [[Stalag Luft III murders|murder 48 of the prisoners]], including Bartlett, MacDonald, Cavendish and Haynes, on the pretext that they were trying to escape, bringing the total dead to 50. Only 3 POWs escape, Danny and Willie steal a rowing boat and proceed downstream to a port, where they board a merchant ship bound for Sweden. Sedgwick steals a bicycle, then rides on a train to France, where the [[French Resistance]] assists him in reaching [[Spain during World War II|Spain]].\n\nHendley, Nimmo and nine others are returned to the camp. When informed of the dead, Hendley wonders if the cost was worth it, and Ramsey tells him it depends on his point of view. Von Luger is relieved of command as Hilts returns and is sent to the cooler, where he plans another escape.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Captain {{vanchor|Virgil Hilts}} 'The Cooler King': one of three Americans in the camp, Hilts irritates guards with frequent escape attempts and an irreverent attitude, to the point that he is regularly confined in isolation in the cooler.

Coburn, an American, was cast in the role of [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick who was an amalgamation of Flt Lt [[Al Hake|Albert Hake]], an Australian serving in the RAF, the camp's compass maker, and Johnny Travis, the real manufacturer.\n\nTilman 'Til Kiwe' Kiver played the German guard \"Frick\", who discovers the escape. Kiwe had been a German paratrooper officer who was captured and held prisoner at a POW camp in Colorado. He made several escape attempts, dyeing his uniform and carrying forged papers. He was captured in the St. Louis train station during one escape attempt. He won the Knight's Cross before his capture and was the cast member who had actually performed many of the exploits shown in the film.\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was made on location in Germany at the [[Bavaria Film]] Studio in the [[Munich]] suburb of Geiselgasteig in rural [[Bavaria]], where sets for the barrack interiors and tunnels were constructed. The camp was built in a clearing of the [[:de:Perlacher Forst|Perlacher Forst]] (Perlacher Forest) near the studio.<ref name=\"Riml\">{{cite book |url=http://www.walter-riml.at/willkommen/1962-gesprengte-ketten/ |title=Behind the scenes...

Many details of the actual escape attempt were changed for the film, including the roles of American personnel in both the planning and the escape. While the characters are fictitious, they are based on real men, in most cases being [[composite character|composites]] of several people. The screenwriters significantly increased the involvement of American POWs; a few American officers in the camp initially helped dig the tunnels and worked on the early plans. However, they were moved away seven months before the escape, which ended their involvement.<ref name=\"Wolter2001\">{{cite book |last=Wolter |first=Tim |title=POW baseball in World War II |publisher=McFarland |year=2001 |pages=24\u201325 |url=https://archive.org/details/powbaseballinwor00wolt/page/24 |url-access=registration |isbn=978-0-7864-1186-3}}</ref><ref name=\"Brickhill\">[[Paul Brickhill|Brickhill, Paul]], ''The Great Escape''</ref> The real escape was by largely British and other Allied personnel, with the exception of American [[Johnnie Dodge#Stalag Luft III (North Compound)|Johnnie Dodge]], who was a British officer.<ref name=\"JWarren\" />\n\nThe film omits the crucial role that Canadians played in building the tunnels and in the escape itself. Of the 1,800 or so POWs, 600 were involved in preparations: 150 of those were Canadian. [[Wally Floody]], an RCAF pilot and former miner who was the real-life \"tunnel king\", was engaged as a technical advisor for the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadaatwar.ca/content-91/world-war-ii/canadians-and-the-great-escape |title=Canadians and the Great Escape |work=Canada at War |date=July 11, 2009 |access-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-date=July 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710173934/http://canadaatwar.ca/content-91/world-war-ii/canadians-and-the-great-escape/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhen Ramsey first meets Von Luger, Luger warns him that although the newly arriving prisoners are well-known for wreaking havoc throughout the Reich with their constant camp breakouts, they will have no success at the new camp. Undaunted, Ramsey tells Von Luger that it is the sworn duty of every officer to attempt escape. In reality, there was no requirement in the King's Regulations, or in any form of international convention.<ref name=\"Walters 2013\" />\n\nThe film shows the tunnel codenamed ''Tom'' with its entrance under a stove and ''Harry's'' in a drain sump in a washroom. In reality, ''Dick's'' entrance was the drain sump, ''Harry's'' was under the stove, and ''Tom's'' was in a darkened corner next to a stove chimney.{{sfn|Vance|2000|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nEx-POWs asked film-makers to exclude details about the help they received from their home countries, such as maps, papers, and tools hidden in gift packages, lest it jeopardise future POW escapes. The film-makers complied.<ref>''The Great Escape: Heroes Underground'' documentary, available on ''The Great Escape'' DVD Special Edition.</ref>\n\nThe film omits any mention that many Germans willingly helped in the escape itself. The film suggests that the forgers were able to make near-exact replicas of just about any pass that was used in Nazi Germany. In reality, the forgers received a great deal of assistance from Germans who lived many hundreds of miles away on the other side of the country. Several German guards, who were openly anti-Nazi, also willingly gave the prisoners items and assistance of any kind to aid their escape.<ref name=\"Walters 2013\">{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Guy |title=The Real Great Escape |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-593-07190-8}}</ref>\n\nThe need for such accuracy produced much eyestrain, but unlike in the film, there were no cases of blindness. Some, such as Frank Knight, gave up forging because of the strain, but he certainly did not suffer the same ocular fate as the character of Colin Blythe in the film.<ref name=\"Walters 2013\" /> In fact, no one in the film says that Colin Blythe's blindness is the result of eyestrain. He identifies his problem as \"progressive [[Near-sightedness|myopia]]\", suggesting that he has not only heard of the condition but has also been diagnosed.\n\nThe film depicts the escape taking place in ideal weather conditions, whereas at the time much was done in freezing temperatures, and snow lay thick on the ground.<ref name=\"Walters 2013\" /> In reality there were no escapes by aircraft or motorcycle: McQueen requested the motorcycle sequence, which shows off his skills as a keen motorcyclist. He did the stunt riding himself (except for the final jump, done by [[Bud Ekins]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motorcycle.com/products/steve-mcqueen-40-summers-ago-12731.html |title=Steve McQueen 40 Summers Ago... |first=Pete |last=Brissette |work=Motorcycle.com |date=July 15, 2005 |access-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-date=October 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016181856/http://www.motorcycle.com/products/steve-mcqueen-40-summers-ago-12731.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Although 76 POWs escaped the film only shows about 30 escaping through the tunnel.\n\nIn the film, Hilts incapacitates, or otherwise kills, a German soldier for his motorcycle, Ashley-Pitt kills Kuhn, a Gestapo officer, when he recognizes Bartlett waiting to pass through a Gestapo checkpoint at a railway station and Hendley knocks out a German guard at the airfield. Sedgwick  witness the killing of German officers at a French Cafe by the French resistance. No German personnel were killed or injured by the escapees.\n\nThe movie shows three truckloads of recaptured POWs splitting off in three directions. One truck contains 20 of the prisoners who are invited to stretch their legs in a field, whereupon they are all machine gunned in a single massacre, with the implication that the other two have the same manner; in reality, the POWs were shot individually or in pairs. The majority of the POWs were killed by pistol shots taken by Gestapo officers; however, at least ten of them were killed in a manner like that portrayed in the film: Dutchy Swain, [[Chaz Hall]], Brian Evans, Wally Valenta, George McGill, Pat Langford, Edgar Humphreys, Adam Kolanowski, Bob Stewart and [[Henry Birkland|Henry \"Hank\" Birkland]].<ref>Andrews (1976), p.49</ref><ref>Vance (2000), p.265</ref><ref>Read (2012), p.244</ref><ref>Andrews (1976), p.187-188</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/cSL_3_Fifty.htm |work=Pegasus Archive |title=Stalag Luft III: The Fifty |access-date=28 August 2015}}</ref><ref>Vance (2000), p.289</ref><ref name=\"Walters 2013\" />\n\nIn addition, the film depicts the three prisoners who escape to freedom as British, Polish, and Australian; in reality, they were Norwegian ([[Jens M\u00fcller (pilot)|Jens M\u00fcller]] and [[Per Bergsland]]) and Dutch ([[Bram van der Stok]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur/hollywood-droppet-nordmenn-1.11568685 |title=Hollywood droppet nordmenn |trans-title=Hollywood dropped Norwegians |first1=Magne |last1=Hansen |first2=Marianne Rustad |last2=Carlsen |work=[[NRK]] |date=February 26, 2014 |access-date=March 15, 2015 |language=no |archive-date=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015145130/http://www.nrk.no/kultur/hollywood-droppet-nordmenn-1.11568685 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, seven POWs returned to Stalag Luft III for the 65th anniversary of the escape<ref name=\"Paterson2009\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/veterans-of-the-great-escape-visit-old-stalag-1653313.html |title=Veterans of the Great Escape visit old Stalag |first=Tony |last=Paterson |work=[[The Independent]] |date=March 25, 2009 |location=London |issn=0951-9467 |oclc=185201487 |access-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-date=February 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228231535/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/veterans-of-the-great-escape-visit-old-stalag-1653313.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and watched the film.

However, Walters points out that an historical account says that one of the two men said \"yes\" in English in response to a Kripo man's questions without any mention of \"good luck\" and notes that as Scheidhauser was French, and Bushell's first language was English, it seems likely that if a slip did take place, it was made by Bushell himself, and says the \"good luck\" scene should be regarded as fiction, and furthermore, a slur upon the Frenchman.<ref name=\"Walters 2013\" />\n\n==Music==\nThe film's iconic music was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]], who gave each major character their own
