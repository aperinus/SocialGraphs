Despite grossing over $275 million worldwide against a budget of $145 million, the film became a [[box-office bomb|box office flop]] and lost the studio $57 million. A TV series based on the film, titled ''[[The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show]]'', premiered on [[Netflix]] on October 9, 2015, with [[Chris Parnell]] replacing Burrell as Mr. Peabody while Charles reprises his role as Sherman.\n\n==Plot==\nMr. Peabody is a highly intelligent [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who lives in a New York City penthouse with his adopted human son, Sherman. Peabody teaches Sherman history by using the [[WABAC time machine|WABAC]] to travel to the past. On his first day of school, Sherman's knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the [[George Washington and the cherry tree|George Washington cherry tree anecdote]] leads to an altercation with one of his classmates, Penny Peterson, who calls him a dog and puts him in a chokehold. After Sherman bites Penny in self-defense,  Peabody is called into the principal\u2019s office and confronted by Ms. Grunion, a [[child protective services]] agent, who suspects Peabody of being an unfit parent and plans to visit their home to investigate.\n\nPeabody invites the Petersons over for a dinner party to make amends before Grunion arrives. Sherman, against Peabody's orders, shows Penny the WABAC and takes her into the past, where she stays in [[Ancient Egypt]] to marry [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]. Sherman returns to the present to get Peabody's help. Penny initially refuses to leave, until she is informed that she as well will be killed alongside Tut during the wedding and escapes with Peabody and Sherman. \n\nWhile trying to return to the present, the WABAC runs out of power, so they stop at the home of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in [[Renaissance Florence]]. Penny goads Sherman into piloting da Vinci\u2019s flying machine, which he manages to do before they crash. After they resume their journey, Sherman learns of Ms. Grunion's plot and argues with Peabody. After they crash-land in the middle of the [[Trojan War]], Sherman runs away and joins [[King Agamemnon]]\u2019s army. During the battle, Penny and Sherman are trapped inside the [[Trojan Horse]] as it rolls towards a ravine; Peabody saves them, but seemingly dies in doing so. \n\nSherman and Penny travel back to a few minutes before they left in the present to find Peabody, despite his earlier warnings to never return to a time when they existed. As Sherman and Penny try to explain the situation, Sherman's earlier self shows up. When Grunion arrives, Peabody tries to conceal the presence of two Shermans, but the second Peabody, having survived the crash, arrives back from Troy. Grunion attempts to collect both Shermans, but they and the Peabodys merge, generating a massive cosmic shockwave. When Grunion again tries to take Sherman away, Peabody bites her in a rage, and she calls the [[New York Police Department]]. Peabody, Penny, and Sherman race to the WABAC, but cannot time-travel due to a rip in the space-time continuum caused by the merging of their cosmic doubles. A portal appears above New York and historical objects and figures rain down upon the city.\n\nThe WABAC crash-lands in [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]] where historical figures and police converge. Grunion calls in animal control to arrest Peabody, but Sherman and all others come to Peabody\u2019s defense. As the rip worsens, Peabody and Sherman take off in the WABAC and travel into the future for a few minutes, successfully undoing the damage. The historical figures are dragged back to their respective eras and Agamemnon takes Grunion with him. Sherman returns to school, having become friends with Penny and deepened his bond with Peabody.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Ariel Winter and Ty Burrell.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ariel Winter]] and [[Ty Burrell]] at the film's Australian premiere in Sydney]]\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as [[Mister Peabody|Hector J.
