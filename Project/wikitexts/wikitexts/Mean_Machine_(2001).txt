The film is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1974 American film ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', featuring [[association football]] rather than [[American football]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nDanny \"The Mean Machine\" Meehan ([[Vinnie Jones]]) is a retired footballer and former captain of [[England national football team|England]], who was banned from football for life for [[Match fixing|fixing]] an unspecified match they played against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. In the present day, after a long drinking session, he drives recklessly to a local bar, where he is pursued by police. Inside the bar, when asked to take a [[Breathalyzer|breathalyser test]], he attacks two police officers and is arrested; he is later convicted and sentenced to three years in Longmarsh prison.\n\nOnce inside, his status as a [[celebrity]] immediately puts him at odds with the guards, and he is brutally beaten by the prison guards soon after arrival. Meehan is told to visit the prison governor's office, who tells Danny that he pulled strings to make sure he served his sentence in Longmarsh, wanting him to work as the head coach of the prison wardens' football team. Meehan declines, and instead suggests the guards allow him to train a team made up of other convicts, who will take on the wardens in a practice match to gear them up for the new season.\n\nMeehan is met with an unwelcome reception from his cellmates, Raj, Jerome and Trojan. Outside, Danny meets and befriends an elderly convict, Doc, who teaches him how to survive in prison. While cleaning the yards with Doc, Meehan is introduced to Sykes, a [[gangster]] and one of the most respected inmates in the prison. Sykes also shows aggression towards Meehan, revealing he lost a large amount of money betting on the England game he had fixed. Later in the prison cafeteria, Meehan makes another ally, meeting the prison's fast-talking contraband dealer \"Massive\".\n\nDanny and Massive begin the recruitment process for his team, but struggle, as many of the inmates are reluctant to join due to both Sykes' influence over the prison and their hatred for Meehan as a cheat. As Danny tries and fails to form a team, Massive is playing football in a prison hallway, when a [[Racism|racist]] guard approaches him and assaults him as the other inmates watch in horror. Meehan lunges at the guard and protects Massive from further beating, earning the respect of many of the other inmates.\n\nDanny starts training up his team of cons, including a violent maximum-security inmate named \"The Monk\". Meanwhile, the warden gets himself into trouble with \"Barry the Bookie,\" an unlicensed bookmaker who was recommended to him by Sykes. After being threatened on the phone by Barry, the warden decides to try to make back the money he owes by betting on the prison guards' team.\n\nA [[Psychosis|psychotic]] inmate named Nitro accuses him of being a snitch, which leads to two other inmates and associates of Sykes ambushing Danny in the showers. As they threaten to cut his eyes out, they are caught by the guards who ask what happened, but Meehan refuses to tell, which earns him the trust of both Sykes' men and Sykes himself. The next day, Sykes and his associates offer to help the team, under the condition that Danny beats one of them in a fight. The fight takes place later that night, and Danny wins by knocking out Sykes' henchman. Sykes tells Danny all is forgiven if his team wins, which would allow Sykes to make back the money he lost on the England match.\n\nAngry that his plan to have Danny killed failed, Nitro, a bomb expert, offers to have Meehan killed in exchange for a transfer to a lower security prison which one of the guards, Ratchett agrees to. Nitro crafts a bomb in his cell and places it in Danny's locker.\n\nWith almost all of the inmates on board and the game approaching, Danny and the rest of the team are going over tactics in one of the cells, when he realises he has left a tape containing footage of the guards playing last year in his locker. Doc offers to go and get it, and as he leaves, Jerome asks Danny why he fixed the England match. Danny reveals he was heavily in debt at the time, and was blackmailed into fixing the game with the promise of enough money to pay off his debt if he threw the game, or the threat of being crippled for life if not. As Danny is telling the other inmates, Doc arrives at the cell and is killed by the bomb. Nitro is subsequently sent to another facility, but not to the minimum-security prison he was promised but to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facility]].\n\nThe match commences shortly after Doc's death. At half time, the inmates' team is winning 1\u20130, and the morale is high until the governor, fearing what will happen if he loses a second bet, attempts to blackmail Meehan, accusing him of accessory to Doc's murder and threatening to sentence him to 20 years unless he throws the match. At first he puts his own interests before that of the team's, deliberately playing poorly and faking injury to be taken off the pitch. As the final moments of the game tick down, he redeems himself, bravely using a square-ball to fellow inmate 'Billy the Limpet' to win the game for the cons. Afterward, the Captain of the Guards, Burton, refuses to co-operate with the governor's attempts to get revenge on Danny, instead congratulating him on the win. The governor's vehicle explodes, and Sykes informs him that he, and Barry the Bookie, will retaliate if he tries anything. A victorious Danny and Massive walk triumphantly across the pitch.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Danny Meehan\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Doc\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Monk\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Chiv\n* [[Danny Dyer]] as Billy the Limpet\n* [[Stephen Walters|Stephen Martin Walters]] as Nitro\n* [[Rocky Marshall]] as Cigs\n* [[Adam Fogerty]] as Mouse\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Governor\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Burton\n* [[Vas Blackwood]] as Massive\n* [[Robbie Gee]] as Trojan\n* [[Geoff Bell (actor)|Geoff Bell]] as Ratchett\n* [[John Forgeham]] as Sykes\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Tracey\n* [[Andrew Grainger]] as Kat\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Bob Likely\n* [[Martin Wimbush]] as Z\n* David Reid as Barman\n* David Cropman as Second Barman\n* [[Omid Djalili]] as Raj\n* [[J.

[[Charlie Hartfield]] (prisoners' team in the film) played with Jones for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], while [[Paul Fishenden]] and [[Brian Gayle]] (guards' team in the film) played with Jones for [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. [[Nevin Saroya]] (prisoners' team) was once a [[Brentford F.C. Reserves and Academy|Brentford youth team player]] and [[Perry Digweed]] (guard's team), played as a goalkeeper primarily for [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], although in the film, he is a defender. [[Ryan Giggs]], then playing for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Wales national football team]], appears briefly (at minute 77:00) as a warden.\n\n==Production==\nProducer Matthew Vaughan, while looking for a film vehicle to highlight ex-soccer star Vinnie Jones, came across director [[Robert Aldrich]]'s 1974 American football comedy ''The Longest Yard''. Jones, who was known for rough play and off-field rowdiness, seemed a natural for the lead role.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/22/entertainment/et-chautard22 |title='Mean Machine,' Soccer's Version of 'Longest Yard' |last=CHAUTARD |first=ANDRE |date=2002-02-22 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-09-05 |issn=0458-3035 |archive-date=21 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321084126/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/22/entertainment/et-chautard22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Mean Machine'' was filmed from April to June 2001.

The scriptwriters have enough sense to replay every funny moment from the original, while also adding a couple of innovations of their own. The final soccer game is definitely the high point of the proceedings, if only because it lets the star do what he does best - play some very dirty football.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/11/29/mean_machine_2001_review.shtml |title=BBC - Films - review - Mean Machine |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2018-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nWhile [[A.O. Scott]] of [[the New York Times]] wrote, \"Reviewing <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Longest Yard<nowiki>''</nowiki> in The New York Times 28 years ago, Nora Sayre objected to its clumsiness and violence, but admitted to being entertained by the football sequences. Watching this remake, I had the opposite response: the story was moderately engaging and moved swiftly, but the long soccer match at the end bored me silly. Perhaps this is just American chauvinism, or perhaps that kind of football is inherently less cinematic than ours. It's certainly no less brutal.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/22/movies/film-in-review-mean-machine.html |title=FILM IN REVIEW; 'Mean Machine' |last=Scott |first=A.
