It was written and directed by [[Christian Carion]],<ref name=\"imdb\">{{Cite web\n|title=Joyeux No\u00ebl (2005)\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424205/\n|website=Internet Movie Database\n|access-date=11 November 2009}}</ref> and screened out of competition at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4283384/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Joyeux No\u00ebl |access-date=12 December 2009|website=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film, which includes one of the last appearances of [[Ian Richardson]] before his death, was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It is a fictionalised account of an actual event that took place in December 1914, when [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince]], sent the lead singer of the [[Berlin]] Imperial Opera company on a solo visit to the [[Western Front (World War I)|front line]]. Singing by the [[tenor]], Walter Kirchhoff, to the [[27th Division (German Empire)|120th and 124th W\u00fcrttemberg]] regiments led French soldiers in their trenches to stand up and applaud.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stanley|last=Weintraub|title=Silent Night: The Story of the World War I Christmas truce|year=2001|publisher=Pocket|location=London|isbn=0-684-86622-6}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe story centres mainly upon six characters: Gordon (a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]); Audebert (a French Lieutenant in the 26th Infantry and reluctant son of a general); Horstmayer (a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] German Lieutenant of the [[8th Division (German Empire)|93rd Infantry]]); Father Palmer (a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] priest working as a [[chaplain]] and [[stretcher-bearer]]); and two famous [[opera]] stars, German [[tenor]] Nikolaus Sprink - [[Walter Kirchoff]] - and his [[Danish people|Danish]] fianc\u00e9e, [[mezzo-soprano]] Anna S\u00f8rensen.\n\nThe film begins with scenes of schoolboys reciting patriotic speeches that both praise their countries and condemn their enemies. In Scotland, two young brothers, Jonathan and William, join up to fight, followed by their [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]], Father Palmer, who becomes a [[chaplain]]. In Germany, Sprink is interrupted during a performance by a German officer announcing a [[Military reserve force|reserve]] call up. French soldier Audebert looks at a photograph of his pregnant wife, whom he has had to leave behind (in the [[German occupation of north-east France during World War I|occupied part]] of France, just in front of his trench), and prepares to exit into the trenches for an Allied assault on German lines. However the assault fails, with the French and Scottish taking many casualties while William loses his life.\n\nIn Germany, Anna gets permission to perform for [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]], and Sprink is allowed to accompany her. They spend a night together and then perform. Afterward, Sprink expresses bitterness at the comfort of the generals at their headquarters, and resolves to go back to the front to sing for the troops. Sprink initially opposes Anna's decision to go with him, but he agrees shortly afterward.\n\nThe unofficial truce begins when the Scots begin to sing festive songs and songs from home, accompanied by [[bagpipes]]. Sprink and S\u00f8rensen arrive on the German front line, and Sprink sings for his comrades. As Sprink sings \"[[Silent Night]]\", he is accompanied by Father Palmer's bagpipes from the Scottish front  line. Sprink responds to Palmer and exits his trench with a small Christmas tree, singing \"[[Adeste Fideles]]\". Following Sprink's lead Audebert, Horstmayer, and Gordon meet in [[no-man's-land]] and agree on a [[cease-fire]] for the evening.\n\nThe various soldiers meet and wish each other \"Joyeux No\u00ebl\", \"Frohe Weihnachten\", and \"Merry Christmas\". They exchange chocolate, champagne, and photographs of loved ones. Horstmayer gives Audebert back his wallet containing a photograph of his wife, which was lost in the attack a few days prior, and they connect over pre-war memories. Father Palmer celebrate a brief [[Eucharist|Mass]] for the soldiers (in [[Latin]] as was the practice in the [[Catholic Church]] at that time), and the soldiers retire deeply moved. However, Jonathan remains totally unmoved by the events around him, choosing to grieve for his brother. The following morning, the Lieutenants agree to extend the truce to allow each side to bury their dead, followed by cordial fraternisation for the rest of the day. As their soldiers play football, Audebert and Horstmayer sympathise, speaking in French of their memories of [[Paris]] and [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]], and their families. Horstmayer offers to take a letter to Lens for Audebert's wife. The next day, as the German forces shell the Allied position, Horstmayer offers to shelter the French and Scottish soldiers in his trench, an offer Audebert and Gordon return to protect the Germans from their own retaliatory bombing. Before parting, aware that the truce has now truly ended, Audebert and Horstmayer lament that they can not be friends, and hope that they both survive the war. As Audebert congratulates Horstmayer on his French, the German reveals that his wife is French.\n\nPrior to the bombing, Horstmayer learns that Anna and Sprink left without the German superior's assent to entertain fellow front soldiers and informs both that Sprink is going to be arrested for disobedience. As the Germans regain their trenches, Anna and Sprink remain behind and ask Audebert to take them as captives, in order to avoid separation. Letters that they hand over to him from the German soldiers (who had been hoping Anna would deliver them when she returned to [[Berlin]]), as well as letters from soldiers all across the front, are intercepted by military authorities, revealing that the truce had occurred.\n\nFather Palmer is being sent back to his own parish and his battalion is disbanded as a mark of shame. Despite emphasising the humanity and goodwill of the truce, he is rebuked by the [[Bishop (Catholicism)|bishop]], who then preaches an [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] sermon to new recruits, in which he describes the Germans as inhumane and commands the recruits to kill every one of them. Father Palmer overhears the sermon and removes his cross as he leaves.\n\nBack in the trenches, the Scots are ordered by a furious major (who is angered by the truce) to shoot a German soldier who is entering no-man's-land and crossing towards French lines. All of the soldiers deliberately miss in response, except the bitter Jonathan, who shoots the targeted German soldier. Audebert, hearing the familiar alarm clock ringing outside, rushes out and discovers that the soldier is a disguised Ponchel, his [[Batman (military)|batman]]. With his dying words, Ponchel reveals he gained help from the German soldiers, visited his mother, and had coffee with her. He also informs Audebert that he has a young son named Henri.\n\nAudebert is punished by being sent to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and he receives a dressing down from his father, a general. In a culminating rant, young Audebert upbraids his father, expressing no remorse at the [[Fraternization|fraternisation]] at the front, and his disgust for civilians and superiors who talk of sacrifice but know nothing of the struggle in the trenches. He also informs the general about his new grandson Henri. Moved by this revelation, the general then recommends they \"both try and survive this war for him\".\n\nHorstmayer and his troops, who are confined in a train, are informed by the German Crown Prince that they are to be shipped to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], without permission to see their families as they pass through Germany. He then stomps on J\u00f6rg's harmonica and says that Horstmayer does not deserve his [[Iron Cross]]. As the train departs, the Germans start humming a Scottish [[Christmas carol|carol]] they learned from the Scots, \"''L'Hymne des Fraternis\u00e9s''/ I'm Dreaming of Home\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Benno F\u00fcrmann]] (singing voice: [[Rolando Villaz\u00f3n]]) as Private Nikolaus Sprink (German tenor) real name [[Walter Kirchhoff]] (Berl\u00edn;1879 \u2014 Wiesbaden; 1951) \n* [[Guillaume Canet]] as Lieutenant Camille Ren\u00e9 Audebert (French 26th Infantry Regiment)\n* [[Diane Kruger]] (singing voice: [[Natalie Dessay]]) as Anna S\u00f8rensen (Danish soprano, Sprink's wife)\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Father Palmer (Scottish priest and stretcher-bearer)\n* [[Alex Ferns]] as Lieutenant Gordon (Scots Fusiliers)\n* [[Dany Boon]] as Private Ponchel (Audebert's batman)\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Leutnant (Lieutenant) Horstmayer (German 93rd Infantry Regiment)\n* [[Christian Carion]] as British Medical Orderly\n* [[Christopher Fulford]] as Royal Scots Fusiliers Major\n* [[Mathias Herrmann]] as German Officer at Headquarters\n* [[Neil McNulty]] as Scottish Soldier\n* [[Lucas Belvaux]] as Gueusselin\n* [[Steven Robertson]] as Jonathan\n* [[Suzanne Flon]] as The Chatelaine\n* [[Bernard Le Coq]] as G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as the Bishop\n* [[Thomas Schmauser]] as the Crown Prince\n\n==Development and production==\nCarion's youth was spent in his parents' farm fields in Northern France, where he was constantly reminded of World War I as the family often found dangerous unexploded shells left over from the conflicts in the fields.

Maybe it's because the kind of wars being fought in the 21st century involve religious, ideological and economic differences that go much deeper and feel more resistant to resolution than the European territorial disputes and power struggles that precipitated World War I... Another reason is that the movie's cross-section of soldiers from France, Scotland and Germany are so scrupulously depicted as equal-opportunity peacemakers that they never come fully to life as individuals.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/movies/03noel.html |author=Holden, Stephen| work=The New York Times|title=Film Review: A Christmas Truce Forged by Germans, French and Scots|date= 3 March 2006|access-date= 9 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] also wrote about the sentimentality of the film, \"''Joyeux No\u00ebl'' has its share of bloodshed, especially in a deadly early charge, but the movie is about a respite from carnage, and it lacks the brutal details of films like ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' ...Its sentimentality is muted by the thought that this moment of peace actually did take place, among men who were punished for it, and who mostly died soon enough afterward.
