[[Tom Hardy]], [[Emily Browning]], [[David Thewlis]] and [[Christopher Eccleston]] star with [[Colin Morgan]], [[Chazz Palminteri]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Tara Fitzgerald]] and [[Taron Egerton]] as well as the singer [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]] featured in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1960s, Reggie Kray is a former [[Boxer (boxing)|boxer]] who has become an important part of the criminal underground in [[London]]. At the start of the film, his twin brother Ron is locked up in a psychiatric hospital for [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. Reggie uses threats to obtain the premature release of his brother. The twins unite their efforts to control a large part of London's criminal underworld. One of their first efforts is to muscle-in on the control of a local nightclub, using extortion and brutal violence.\n\nReg enters into a relationship with Frances, his driver's sister, whom he eventually marries. When he is imprisoned for a previous criminal conviction, which he cannot evade, she makes him swear that he will leave his criminal life behind, an oath he never honours due to the allure of crime. While Reg is in prison, Ron's mental instability and violent temperament lead to severe financial setbacks at the nightclub. The club is almost forced to close after Ron scares away most of the customers. On the first night after Reg's release from prison, the brothers have an all-out fist fight, but they manage to partially patch things up.\n\nThe brothers are approached by [[Angelo Bruno]] of the [[Philadelphia crime family]] who, on behalf of [[Meyer Lansky]] and the [[American Mafia]], wants to engage them in a crime syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty deal with Reg to split London's underground gambling profits in exchange for local protection by the brothers. Initially, this system is highly lucrative for the Kray brothers. Ron's barely concealed volatility results in him publicly murdering George Cornell, an associate of the [[The Richardson Gang|Torture Gang]], rivals of the Krays. As a result, [[Scotland Yard]] opens a full investigation of the Kray brothers.\n\nReg's marriage with Frances crumbles due to his addiction to crime. Unable to bear Reg's false promises to reform, Frances starts consuming prescription drugs illegally. After he beats and rapes her in a fit of rage, she leaves him. When Reg approaches her to reconcile, Frances seems to agree and they plan to visit [[Ibiza]]. But soon she kills herself by drug overdosage leaving Reg guilt ridden. The twins' criminal activities continue and Ron pays petty criminal [[Jack McVitie|Jack \"the Hat\" McVitie]] to kill Leslie Payne, Reg's partner, who controls the legal side of the Krays' operations, as he doesn't trust Payne. Jack only wounds Payne, who then turns the brothers over to Detective Superintendent [[Nipper Read|Leonard \"Nipper\" Read]], the head of the investigation. Reg finds out and brutally stabs McVitie with a knife during a party hosted by Ron. The testimony given by Payne means that Ron is arrested and charged with Cornell's murder. The final scene shows a police squad breaking down the door to Reggie's flat in order to apprehend him for McVitie's murder.\n\nThe closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal convictions for murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a [[heart attack]] in 1995, and Reggie from [[bladder cancer]] in 2000.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as [[Kray twins|Ronald \"Ronnie\" Kray and Reginald \"Reggie\" Kray]]<ref name=\"BBC News 13 June 2014\"/>\n:Identical twins who terrorised London during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=\"BBC News 4 April 2000\">{{cite web | title= The Krays: A history of violence |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/702012.stm| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 4 April 2000 | website= [[BBC News Online]] | access-date= 10 September 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[Emily Browning]] as Frances Shea<ref name=\"The Guardian 13 June 2014\">{{cite news|title=Tom Hardy plays Kray twins in Legend \u2013 first image|last= Child| first= Ben| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/13/tom-hardy-kray-twins-legend-first-image|access-date= 10 September 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emily-browning-talks-join-tom-698601|title=Emily Browning in Talks to Join Tom Hardy in Crime Thriller 'Legend'|date=23 April 2014|access-date=23 April 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n:The wife of Reggie Kray.
