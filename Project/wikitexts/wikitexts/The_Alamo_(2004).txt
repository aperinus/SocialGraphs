The film was directed by [[John Lee Hancock]], produced by [[Ron Howard]], [[Brian Grazer]], and [[Mark Johnson (film producer)|Mark Johnson]], distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner), and starring [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Sam Houston]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as [[Davy Crockett]], [[Jason Patric]] as [[Jim Bowie]], and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[William B. Travis]]. The screenplay is credited to Hancock, [[Stephen Gaghan]], and [[Leslie Bohem]].\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], losing the studio over $146 million.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|author=Gabbi Shaw|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in March 1836 in the town of [[San Antonio de Bexar]], showing the aftermath of the Battle of the Alamo. The film then flashes back to a year earlier. [[Sam Houston]] attends a party where he tries to persuade people to migrate to Texas and encounters [[David Crockett]], recently defeated in his bid for re-election to [[United States Congress|Congress]]. In [[San Felipe, Texas]], the Texas provisional government is meeting to discuss what action to take after the capture of the Alamo and Bexar by the Texans in the [[Siege of B\u00e9xar|recent fighting]]. Texas has rebelled against Mexico, and its dictatorial president [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] is personally leading one wing of his army to retake San Antonio, then invade the settlements and put an end to the rebellion. Various selfish members of the Texan War Party call for the Texas army to depart Bexar, cross into Mexico and capture the town of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. The more sensible Opposition Party seeks to rebuild the Texan army and establish a permanent government.\n\nThe provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army; a disgusted Houston tells [[Jim Bowie]] to go to San Antonio, destroy the fortifications (including the Alamo) and retreat eastward. The Texas government then orders [[William B. Travis|William Barret Travis]] to Bexar, where Col. Neil, the Alamo's commander, gives Travis command of the post as Neil must leave to take care of a family emergency before returning with reinforcements. Travis, knowing that the Alamo's small force cannot withstand the Mexican Army, sends couriers with pleas for reinforcements. As small groups of Texans arrive, Travis oversees defense preparations, hoping that enough reinforcements will arrive before the inevitable final assault.\n\nCrockett, coming to Texas to revive his political career, arrives in San Antonio, is surprised to learn that the fighting isn't over, and that Santa Anna and his army aren't expected until perhaps mid-March. But after a grueling forced march, Santa Anna unexpectedly arrives on Feb. 23, forcing the Texans to hurriedly retire to the Alamo compound. Despite its vulnerability, the Texans resume fortifying it as best they can. Travis continues to send for reinforcements, but few men arrive.\n\nSanta Anna's troops surround the fort, and the siege begins. Bowie meets with Mexican General [[Manuel Fernandez Castrillon|Manuel Castrill\u00f3n]] to talk things over, but Travis stubbornly fires a cannon at the Mexican camp, abruptly ending their conversation. Bowie returns to tell Travis that Santa Anna has offered the opportunity to surrender, but the defenders decide to stay and fight. With his hopes of an easy victory foiled, Santa Anna settles in for a siege but orders that no quarter be given to the Alamo defenders. Bowie's ongoing illness renders him bedridden, and Travis assumes full command.\n\nOn Sunday, March 6, Mexican troops assault the Alamo's walls in a pre-dawn attack. Despite heavy casualties, they breach the walls and most of the Texans, including Travis and Bowie, are slain in the onslaught. Crockett, the last survivor, is taken prisoner, and in a final act of defiance he mockingly offers to [[Safe conduct|safely lead]] Santa Anna to Sam Houston. Santa Anna angrily orders Crockett to be executed.\n\nDays later, after hearing that the Alamo has fallen, Houston, now in full command of all Texan troops, orders [[Runaway Scrape|a general retreat]] eastward. They are pursued by the victorious Mexican Army, led by the confident Santa Anna. In an attempt to catch the retreating Texans, and against the advice of his officers, Santa Anna divides his forces, taking a smaller, fast-moving force with him to chase Houston and the fleeing Texas government. A few weeks later, Houston halts his retreat near the [[San Jacinto River (Texas)|San Jacinto]], where he decides to risk all in a sudden attack when he learns of Santa Anna's presence. With the support of [[Twin Sisters (cannons)|two cannons]] and a group of [[Juan Segu\u00edn|Juan Seguin's]] mounted [[Tejanos]], Houston surprises Santa Anna's army during its afternoon siesta, and in [[Battle of San Jacinto|the ensuing rout]] the vengeful Texans massacre at least seven hundred Mexican soldiers and capture Santa Anna. In exchange for his life, Santa Anna agrees to order all Mexican troops to withdraw from Texas and accept Texan independence. The film ends with an eerie replay of Crockett standing atop the Alamo's South wall, playing his fiddle while overlooking the compound.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as General [[Sam Houston]]\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Colonel [[Davy Crockett]]\n* [[Jason Patric]] as Colonel [[James Bowie|Jim Bowie]]\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Lieutenant Colonel [[William B.

Bohem had a conversation with [[Braveheart]] screenwriter [[Randall Wallace]] at the [[Austin Film Festival]], who told Bohem about a trip he had taken to [[San Antonio]] to take a look at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]].

A number of buildings, including the mission, were constructed for the film, at a cost of about $10 million. They depicted a Spanish colonial village. The sets were subsequently abandoned but were visited occasionally, at the Milton Reimers Ranch Park, although they were deteriorating; they were not intended to endure for a long period of time. Nine of the 12 major structures were damaged in a fire in September 2011.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alamo-movie-fire-idUSTRE78R6B220110928 Fire destroys set of 2004 \"Alamo\" remake in Texas]</ref><ref>[https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Alamo-movie-set-burned-by-fire-2193661.php Alamo movie set burned by fire]</ref> The park's web site in 2020 makes no mention of the movie or the sets.<ref>[https://parks.traviscountytx.gov/parks/reimers-ranch Milton Reimers Ranch Park]</ref>\n\nHancock's version was purported to be the most accurate of all the Alamo films, but various liberties were taken, such as building the Alamo chapel facade forward 40 feet more than the extant (and presumably historically-correct) structure. According to one of the DVD version's special features, Hancock did that to show the Alamo chapel and the interior of the fort in one shot.\n\n===Battle scenes===\nIn the winter of 1835\u20131836, when the Mexican Army was moving north through desert areas, shortly before it crossed the Rio Bravo ([[Rio Grande]]), it endured a snowstorm of uncommon intensity, and soldiers suffered illness and hunger. Snow making machines were used to create the scenes of the march through the snow. Four days later, an actual snow storm blanketed the set. Two calls were made to find thin and gaunt extras to play the soldiers, but the film's scenes of the attack on the Alamo were shot in harsh weather. Extras stood for hours in cold rain, making some scenes gruelingly realistic. A few days of the filming was held up, due to bitter cold and very muddy conditions.\n\n===Final editing===\nAfter the film was shot, it was edited down to three hours; later it was reduced to two hours, with scenes and certain characters removed. Shortly prior to the release, 15 minutes were added. Nonetheless, Quaid's role had been significantly reduced from the first version.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/24/movies/battle-disney-may-never-forget-for-alamo-long-bumpy-road-conception-release.html A Battle Disney May Never Forget; For 'The Alamo,' a Long and Bumpy Road, From Conception to Release]</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nThe depiction of Crockett's fate came from memoirs written by [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique de la Pe\u00f1a]], an officer in Santa Anna's army. Though accepted by many historians, this was the first film to show Crockett executed as a prisoner of war; all others had depicted his death as occurring during the battle. That sparked criticism from many Alamo enthusiasts and some historians, given the disputed nature of its origins.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuchs |first=Cynthia |url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/34178/alamo-dvd/ |title=The Alamo (2004) |publisher=PopMatters |access-date=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews.

It's not the jingoistic call to patriotism of [[The Alamo (1960 film)|John Wayne's 1960 version]], either.
