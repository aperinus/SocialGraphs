The film is a [[sequel]] to the 1999 film ''[[Analyze This]]''. The film starred [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Billy Crystal]] who respectively reprise their roles as mobster Paul Vitti and psychiatrist Ben Sobel.\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] developed a follow up to the film, with much of the same cast and crew returning. ''Analyze That'' was released on December 6, 2002, however, did not achieve the commercial success that the first film had, grossing only $55 million worldwide against its $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nNear the completion of his sentence in [[Sing Sing]], Paul Vitti's life is threatened by assassins and corrupt guards while incarcerated. He starts singing showtunes from ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' to get the attention of Ben Sobel, who previously hung up on him while attending his father's funeral. \n\nThe FBI calls in Ben to perform psychiatric tests on Paul to determine if he is feigning insanity. After the tests, it appears Paul's mental state is deteriorating, and the FBI approves Paul's release for one month, into Ben's custody, for further therapy. As Ben drives Paul from prison, Paul immediately reveals that he was faking. \n\nBen talks Paul into finding a regular job as requested by the FBI. Paul attempts to find a legitimate job (he tries a car dealer, a restaurant, and a jewelry store), but his rude manners and paranoia only complicate things further. This ends up in him getting fired each time.\n\nAt the same time, Paul is told by ''[[de facto]]'' boss Patti LoPresti that the Rigazzi family wants him dead. He responds to this by telling the Rigazzis that he is \"out\" and seeking a new line of employment. He eventually finds employment working as a technical advisor on the set of a mafia [[Television program|TV series]]. \n\nMeanwhile, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents inform Ben that Paul has his former crew back together, and may be planning something major. This rouses Ben's suspicion, and he visits Paul. Both get caught up in a car chase with Rigazzi hitmen, which ends up with Paul escaping. The FBI blames Ben, and gives him 24 hours to locate Paul.\n\nAfter locating Paul through Ben's son Michael, who is now working as Paul's chauffeur, Ben discovers Paul is planning a big armored car heist with LoPresti as a partner. He attempts to intervene and talk Paul out of it but Paul proceeds and Ben is forced to go along as well. \n\nThe crew ambushes the armored car with smoke grenades, and lift it over a fence in the midst of the confusion. They extract over $22 million of [[Precious metal#Bullion|gold bullion]], but LoPresti's thugs take over, revealing themselves to actually have been working for Rigazzi. \n\nBen, in a fit of anger, beats one of them, and Paul's men apprehend the others. They use the gold bullion to frame the Rigazzi family, leaving three Rigazzi goons locked in the armored truck suspended from the crane. This leads to the arrest of the entire Rigazzi family, and in turn, prevents a mob war.\n\nBen meets with Paul and Jelly near bridges on the New York waterfront, and they part ways again as friends, singing [[Somewhere (song)|another]] ''West Side Story'' showtune together. During the credits, [[bloopers]] are shown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Paul Vitti\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Ben Sobel\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Laura Sobel\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as \"Jelly\"\n* [[Cathy Moriarty-Gentile]] as Patti LoPresti\n* [[Joey Diaz|Joey \"Coco\" Diaz]] as \"Ducks\"\n* [[Thomas Rosales, Jr.]] as \"Coyote\"\n* Kyle Sabihy as Michael Sobel\n* [[Rebecca Schull]] as Ben's Mother\n* Dr. [[Joyce Brothers]] as Herself\n* [[James Biberi]] as FBI Agent Miller\n* [[Callie Thorne]] as FBI Agent Cerrone\n* [[Firdous Bamji]] as Dr. Kassam\n* [[John Finn]] as Richard Chapin\n* [[Sylvia Kauders]] as Aunt Esther\n* [[Pat Cooper]] as Masiello\n* [[Steven Kampmann]] as Mr. Macinerny\n* [[Tom Papa]] as Boyfriend\n* [[Joe Torre]] as Himself\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Joey \"Boots\"\n* [[Charles A.

They believed, as said by Crystal, that \"there was an unfinished relationship between Ben Sobel and Paul Vitti from the first film\" and \"there was a good story to tell\", so the sequel was commissioned.<ref name=LEV>{{cite web |url=http://www.levinson.com/bsc/analyzethat/prod.htm |title=Analyze That Production Notes |access-date=3 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of the sequel was inspired by an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the [[psychotherapy]] used in the mafia [[Television program|TV show]] ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Ramis said the article \"raised questions about human nature and morality...Can the criminal mind be turned?\" and he became interested in what would happen if \"Paul Vitti got out of jail and committed himself to going straight.\"<ref name=LEV/>\n\nThe production arranged for Dr. Stephen A. Sands, a psychiatrist and faculty member of [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to be a technical adviser for the film, and he remained on set during the filming of scenes that involved psychiatric issues. Sands was very familiar with the details of mobster [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante]]'s alleged mental illness, after studying the case during his post-doctoral training. Sands also arranged for De Niro to visit [[Bellevue Hospital]]'s psychiatric unit to meet patients and psychiatrists to discuss the character's symptoms, and De Niro sometimes participated in [[group therapy]] sessions during these visits.<ref name=LEV/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in April 2002, and most of the scenes were shot in and around [[New York City]], 7 months after the [[September 11 attacks|9-11]] attacks. Producer Jane Rosenthal said they decided to shoot the film there because \"[i]t would have been unpatriotic not to shoot the picture in New York... As a New Yorker it was extremely important for me to get back to work and business as usual after 9-11.\"<ref name=REV>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=1946 |title=CinemaReview.com Production Notes |access-date=3 January 2008 |archive-date=January 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129235919/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=1946 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFilming locations for Vitti's attempts at lawful employment include an [[Audi]] dealership on Park Avenue in [[Manhattan]], a jewelry store in the [[Diamond District]] on West 47th Street, and [[Gallagher's Steak House]] on West 52nd Street. The prison scenes were filmed at the [[Riker's Island]] prison in Queens, with the prison release scene shot outside the entrance to [[Sing Sing]] Prison in Ossining, New York. The funeral for Ben's father was filmed at [[Riverside Memorial Chapel]] on Manhattan's Upper West Side, and the Sobel household scenes shot in [[Montclair, New Jersey]]. The dinner at Nogo restaurant was filmed at West 13th Street in a restaurant that had closed down, and been refurbished by the film's art department. The scenes of Patty LoPresti's home were filmed in [[Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey]], and the Little Caesar set in Washington Square Park, Manhattan.<ref name=REV/> Car chases were filmed on New Jersey Turnpike service roads in Kearney.<ref name=REV/> The heist-planning scenes were shot in two locations: a derelict building in the meat packing district near West 14th Street, and a club called Exit on West 56th Street. The majority of the heist scenes were shot in an empty lot in West 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues, and below a West Side Highway underpass. While filming part of the heist sequence at the New York State 369th Regiment armory, on [[145th Street (Manhattan)|145th Street]] and [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]], the film set was visited by former President [[Bill Clinton]], who was pleased the movie was being filmed in New York. The scene at a drive-through bank where the money flies before the police chase was filmed in [[Carlstadt, New Jersey]].<ref name=REV/>\n\nDuring filming in Manhattan's [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea district]] June 14, Amanda Winklevoss, older sister to [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]], died from unknown complications after climbing into a camera truck.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tingir |first1=Roxanne |title=Georgetown Student Dies After Accident |url=https://thehoya.com/georgetown-student-dies-after-accident/ |publisher=The Hoya |access-date=29 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Amanda Gesine Winklevoss Obituary |url=https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/nytimes/name/amanda-winklevoss-obituary?id=29766988 |website=Legacy |publisher=New York Times |access-date=29 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Cinematographer]] Ellen Kuras said that in shooting the film, the intention was to highlight the contrast between Vitti and Sobel's environments, because the film \"exists in two different worlds...
