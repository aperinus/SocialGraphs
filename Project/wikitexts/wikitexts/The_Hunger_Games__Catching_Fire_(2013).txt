The film is the sequel to ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' (2012) and the second installment in [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' film series]], produced by [[Nina Jacobson]] and Jon Kilik, with co-production by [[Lionsgate Films]] and distributed by [[Lionsgate Entertainment]]. [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the film, with a screenplay by [[Simon Beaufoy]] and [[Michael Arndt]] (credited as Michael deBruyn). Adding to the existing cast, the supporting cast was filled out with [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], [[Sam Claflin]], [[Lynn Cohen]], [[Jena Malone]], and [[Amanda Plummer]]. Filming began on September 10, 2012, in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], before moving to [[Hawaii]]. The plot of ''Catching Fire'' begins a few months after the previous installment; [[Katniss Everdeen]] and fellow District 12 tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] have returned home safely after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games. Throughout the story, Katniss senses that a rebellion against the oppressive Capitol is simmering among the districts.\n\n''The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'' premiered in London on November 11, 2013 and was theatrically released on November 15, 2013, in Brazil; November 20 in Finland, Sweden, and Norway; November 21 in the United Kingdom; and November 22 in [[IMAX]], in the United States. The film set records for the biggest November opening weekend and biggest three- and five-day Thanksgiving box-office totals, surpassing the first film's box office grosses by over $150 million. It ranks as the 26th-highest-grossing film at the domestic box office<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm|title=All Time Domestic Box Office Results|work=boxofficemojo.com|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> and the highest-grossing film at the domestic box office of 2013, becoming the first 2-D film since ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) to top the yearly box office, as well as having a lead female top the box office for the first time since ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973). The film has grossed over $865 million worldwide and is the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2013]], the highest-grossing film released by [[Lionsgate]], and the highest-grossing entry in ''The Hunger Games'' series. The film was followed by ''The Hunger Games: Mockingjay'', a two-part sequel and finale of the franchise: ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1|Part 1]]'' was released on November 21, 2014, in the United States, and ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2|Part 2]]'' on November 20, 2015.\n\n''Catching Fire'' received positive reviews and is considered by critics to be an improvement over its predecessor, with the sentiment being that it's \"a more-confident, more-polished movie\"; and praised Lawrence's performance as Katniss, themes, action sequences, musical score, screenplay, visual effects and emotional depth. It was the most critically acclaimed chapter in ''The Hunger Games'' series, according to review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The film also received numerous nominations, with a nomination for the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] for [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Action Film|Best Action Film]] and a [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. For her performance, Lawrence was nominated a second time for the [[Empire Awards|Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] as well as the Saturn Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award. The song \"[[Atlas (Coldplay song)|Atlas]]\" was also nominated for the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots are 400 to 700 words only-->\n{{see|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n\n[[Katniss Everdeen]] and [[Peeta Mellark]] have settled into a life of material comfort and emotional unease back in [[Fictional world of The Hunger Games#District 12|District 12]] following their joint victory in the 74th Hunger Games. President Snow visits Katniss and explains that her actions in the Games \u2014 specifically, her would-be suicide pact with Peeta \u2014 have inspired uprisings across Panem. He orders her to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince him that her actions were out of love and not defiance against the Capitol, warning her that her friends, family, and everyone else in District 12 will otherwise face execution. Katniss' mentor, Haymitch, later warns her that Victors of the games must serve as mentors to future tributes and that their show of love will be forced to continue for the rest of their lives.\n\nUnrest and protests are on display in many Districts over the course of the Victory Tour, as is brutality by local Peacekeepers. Peeta and Katniss subsequently announce their engagement in an attempt to quell the Districts. At an upper-class party concluding the tour, Snow publicly toasts them but subtly signals to Katniss that he remains unconvinced. During the festivities, Katniss meets enigmatic new head Gamemaker [[Plutarch Heavensbee]]. Peacekeepers led by the brutal Commander Romulus Thread begin to mercilessly raid homes and other places throughout District 12, placing the citizens under curfew. Katniss's friend Gale is publicly [[flogging|whipped]] after tackling Thread to stop him from killing civilians; he is saved by Katniss and the other victors. Heavensbee tells Snow that the rebellion cannot survive Katniss\u2019 new celebrity status as a victor.\n\nThe upcoming 75th Hunger Games - the third \"Quarter Quell\" \u2014 is announced, with tributes set to be selected from previous victors. Katniss devotes herself to ensuring Peeta survives. On Reaping Day, Haymitch's name is drawn, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take his place. The adult tributes, accustomed to a safe and comfortable life as victors, are openly angry about being forced to return to the Games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna sets it to transform into a symbol of a [[mockingjay]]. During his interview, Peeta lies that he and Katniss have married in secret and are expecting a child, leading to fruitless protests from citizens for the Games to be stopped. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna  is beaten to death by Peacekeepers in front of her as punishment for tampering with her dress.\n\nIn the Games, Katniss and Peeta ally themselves with the District 4 tributes, playboy Finnick Odair and his elderly mentor Mags. When the arena's forcefield shocks Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick resuscitates him. The group is later forced to flee from a [[Blister agent|poisonous fog]]; when Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick can help him. The group discovers that water removes the gas-induced blisters. When [[mandrill]]s attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a drug-addicted tribute from District 6. The group escapes to the beach, where they meet up with Beetee and Wiress, a pair of scientist tributes from District 3, and acerbic District 7 tribute Johanna Mason. Wiress, who has suffered a nervous breakdown, repeats the phrase \"tick-tock\", leading Katniss to realize that the arena is designed like a clock, with regular hazards each hour contained within their respective zones. Wiress's throat is slit by Gloss, one of the Careers from District 1. Gloss is then fatally shot by Katniss while Johanna kills his sister, Cashmere. Finnick is injured by another Career. Heavensbee has the Gamemakers spin the clock to disorient the tributes.\n\nBeetee suggests luring the rest of the Careers to the wet beach and electrocuting them, taking advantage of the lightning that strikes every 12 hours. The group separates to prepare the trap, laying down wire. When District 2 tributes Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna stuns Katniss, cuts the tracker out of her arm and flees. Katniss finds an unconscious Beetee. Unable to find Peeta, and hearing a cannon, Katniss almost kills Finnick, thinking he betrayed them, but he reminds her to \"remember who the real enemy is\". Katniss attaches wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena roof just as lightning strikes. The lightning is conducted along the wire, causing the arena shields to fail and the roof to fall, and Katniss is knocked unconscious.\n\nKatniss awakens in an aircraft with Haymitch, Finnick, a still-unconscious Beetee, and Heavensbee, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. Haymitch tells her they are bound for [[The Hunger Games universe#District 13|District 13]], headquarters of the new rebellion. He reveals that half the tributes were in on a plan to rescue Katniss, a symbol of the growing rebellion, but that Peeta and Johanna have been captured. A distraught Katniss is sedated after attempting to attack Haymitch for violating his promise to save Peeta. She awakens to find Gale by her side, who reassures her that her family is safe but that District 12 has been destroyed by the Capitol.\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|character descriptions from the novels|List of The Hunger Games characters}} \n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as [[Peeta Mellark]]\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as [[Gale Hawthorne]]\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Haymitch Abernathy]]\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Effie Trinket|Effie Trinket]]\n* [[Lenny Kravitz]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cinna|Cinna]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]]\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Beetee|Beetee Latier]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Caesar Flickerman|Caesar Flickerman]]\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Snow|President Coriolanus Snow]]\n* [[Toby Jones]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Claudius Templesmith|Claudius Templesmith]]\n* [[Willow Shields]] as [[Primrose Everdeen]]\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Finnick Odair]]\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Mags Flanagan|Mags Flanagan]]\n* [[Jena Malone]] as [[Johanna Mason]]\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Wiress|Wiress]]\n* [[Meta Golding]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Enobaria|Enobaria]]\n* [[Bruno Gunn]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Brutus|Brutus]]\n* [[Alan Ritchson]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Gloss|Gloss]]\n* Stephanie Leigh Schlund as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cashmere|Cashmere]]\n* [[Patrick St. Esprit]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thread|Romulus Thread]]\n* [[Paula Malcomson]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Mrs Everdeen|Mrs Everdeen]]\n* [[Stef Dawson]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Annie Cresta|Annie Cresta]]\n* [[Nelson Ascencio]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Flavius|Flavius]]\n* Bruce Bundy as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Octavia|Octavia]]\n* [[William Tokarsky]] as Someone Else\n{{Div col end}}\n<!-- Please do not add UNBILLED actors unless there is a citation for notability-->\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Lionsgate]] announced that a film adaptation of ''[[Catching Fire]]'' would be released as ''The Hunger Games: Catching Fire'' on November 22, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|first=Joshua L|last=Weinstein|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/hunger-games-sequel-set-2013-release-29880|title= The Hunger Games Sequel Set for 2013 Release|work=The Wrap|date=August 8, 2011|access-date=August 15, 2011}}</ref> as a sequel to the [[The Hunger Games (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', with [[principal photography]] to take place in September 2012.
