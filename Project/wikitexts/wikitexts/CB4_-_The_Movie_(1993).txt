The film follows a [[fiction]]al [[rap group]] named \"CB4\", named after the prison block in which the group was allegedly formed (Cell Block 4). The movie primarily parodies the rap group [[N.W.A]] among other [[gangsta rap]] aspects, as well as taking inspiration from ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. It contains short segments featuring celebrities and musicians such as [[Halle Berry]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Ice-T]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Flavor Flav]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIES : Rap Attack, Take Two : Nearly a decade after a spate of breakdancing duds, the big screen's gettin' busy--with 3 films in the genre coming out  |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-03-14|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-14/entertainment/ca-517_1_rap-film|access-date=2011-11-06|first=Chris|last=Willman}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAlbert, an aspiring [[rap]]per and suburban kid who idolizes the gangsta rappers he sees on TV, and his friends Euripides and Otis decide that they want to start a rap group. Unfortunately, even though all three of them are talented, they have no connections and no image with which they can market themselves.\n\nIn order to get their name heard and build up a reputation, they appeal to local crime [[Crime boss|kingpin]] and [[nightclub]] owner Gusto, along with his sidekick and henchman 40 Dog, to ask for a spot on the bill at his club. During their meeting, by complete coincidence, the police rush in and throw Gusto in jail. Gusto believes that the trio set him up, swearing revenge when he is released from prison. Taking advantage of the situation, Albert steals his criminal background and identity, renaming himself \"MC Gusto\" while Euripides and Otis take the names \"Dead Mike\" and \"Stab Master Arson\", respectively. Pretending to be newly released convicts, they form the hardcore gangsta rap group CB4 (Cell Block 4) and successfully sign with Trustus Jones, a local music mogul.\n\nCB4 quickly becomes the hottest band on the charts with controversial hits like \"Sweat from My Balls\" and \"Straight Outta LoCash\", and their rise to fame is documented by an aspiring director and his cameraman. However, an ambitious politician seeks to shut them down for [[obscenity]] charges, tensions between the group arise over one member's gold-digging groupie girlfriend Sissy, and the strain of the charade takes its toll on Albert's family life and relationship with his wholesome girlfriend Daliha. To compound this, the real Gusto escapes from prison and exacts his revenge by making Albert take part in a record store robbery, exposing his face to the CCTV cameras and then taking the tape as a tool for blackmail so he can profit from Albert's success.\n\nCB4 breaks up, with Dead Mike becoming an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] rapper while Stab Master Arson establishes himself as a successful DJ, leaving Albert to wallow in self-pity and his growing addiction to drugs. One day, he gets a call from Mike that Trustus is dead, having choked to death in terror when Gusto pointed a gun at him in a restaurant. Fed up with Gusto taking everything he has, Albert decides to set up a sting operation to nab the gangster by having Sissy seduce him and then trading places with her to entrap Gusto so the police can arrest him and send him to prison for life.\n\nAlbert accepts that he is not a gangsta and makes a comeback under his own name. He persuades Mike and Stab Master Arson to reform the group, and they embark on a highly successful reunion tour.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Albert Brown / M.C.

Three generations.\" was used in the Chris Rock tracks \"Champagne\" and \"I Loved the Show\" from his 1997 album ''[[Roll with the New]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie had a mixed reception from critics. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that despite ''CB4'' having been \"one of the more adventurous of the recent African-American comedies, it still gets bogged down in those movie-movie formulas, those phony recipes for success.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'CB4' Hips, Hops and Just Bounces Too Much  |work=Los Angeles Times|date=1993-03-12|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-12/entertainment/ca-9899_1_chris-rock|access-date=2011-11-06|first=Michael|last=Wilmington}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''' Janet Maslin wrote that the film \"promises sharper satire than it actually delivers.
