It depicts the events on board a luxury liner filled with the friends of a deceased opera singer who have gathered to mourn her. The film was selected as the Italian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[56th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens depicting a scene in July 1914 immediately prior to the cruise ship ''Gloria N.'' setting sail from [[Naples]] Harbor. The opening sequence is in sepia tones, as if it were a film shot in that era, with no sound other than the whirring of the projector. Gradually the sepia fades into full colour and we can hear the characters\u2019 dialogue.\n\nOrlando, an Italian journalist, supplies commentary by directly addressing the camera, explaining to the viewer that the cruise is a funeral voyage to disperse the ashes of opera singer Edmea Tetua near the island of Erimo, her birthplace. Considered the greatest singer of all time, Tetua is celebrated for her goddess-like voice.\n\nThe bumbling but lovable journalist also provides highly subjective anecdotes and gossip on the wide array of cartoon characters that evoke the golden age of the \"funny papers\" (''[[Little Nemo]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, [[Bringing Up Father]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, [[The Katzenjammer Kids]]''{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}) but with a perverse Felliniesque twist. These include more opera singers, voice teachers, orchestra directors, theatre producers, actors, prime ministers, counts, princesses, Grand Dukes, and panic-stricken fans of the deceased diva.\n\nA jealous and bitter soprano named Ildebranda desperately tries to penetrate the secret behind Edmea Tetua's unforgettable voice. A bristle-haired Russian basso is shown around the ship's vast mess hall where, using only his voice, he [[chicken hypnotism|hypnotizes a chicken]]. A curly-cued actor travels with his mother in order to seduce sailors. Sir Reginald Dongby, a voyeuristic English aristocrat, relishes spying on Lady Violet, his nymphomaniac wife. The Grand Duke of Harzock, a Prussian, is an obese bubble of a young man whose blind sister (the [[Tanztheater]] performer and choreographer [[Pina Bausch]]) schemes with her lover, the prime minister, to disinherit her brother. The brooding Count of Bassano closets himself in his cabin transformed into a temple dedicated to the diva's memory.\n\nAn awful stench rises from the ship's hold and soon it's revealed that a love-sick rhinoceros has been neglected by the ship's crew. The beast is pulled up, washed on deck, and returned to the hold with fresh water and hay.\n \nOn the third day of the voyage, the passengers discover a crowd of shipwrecked Serbians camped on the deck of the ship. Fleeing in rafts towards Italy after the assassination at Sarajevo, the refugees were brought on board the previous night by the captain. The Grand Duke and his men, however, are convinced the Serbians are terrorists and order the captain to isolate the group to a corner of the ship. The upshot is Fellini's barely disguised take on the [[Marx Brothers]]'s ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in a heady mix of cultures, both ethnic and artistic, where aristocrats and snobs joyfully share the stage (the ship's deck) with peasants and vibrant Serbian folklore (as choreographed by Leonetta Bentivoglio<ref name=\"FondazioneFellini\">{{cite web |title=E la nave va |url=http://www.federicofellini.it/node/537 |website=www.federicofellini.it | publisher=Fondazione Federico Fellini | via=Comune di Rimini \u2013 Cineteca comunale |access-date=1 June 2019 |language=it}}</ref>).\n\nBut the revels end when the menacing flagship of the Austro-Hungarian fleet sails into view, demanding the return of the Serbian refugees. The captain agrees on condition that Edmea Tetua's ashes be dispersed at Erimo beforehand. After the ceremony, the refugees are loaded into a lifeboat for delivery to the Austrians but a young Serbian hurls a bomb at the flagship, causing pandemonium. The Austrians respond by cannon fire. The ''Gloria N.'' sinks while Albertini wields his baton, aristocrats march to the lifeboats, a grand piano slides across the floor smashing mirrors, and butterflies twitter serenely above the melee of suitcases in flooded corridors.\n\nIn a reverse [[tracking shot]], Fellini reveals the stupendous behind-the-scenes of his floating opera of a movie - giant hydraulic jacks (constructed by Oscar-winning set designer, [[Dante Ferretti]]) that created the ship's rolling sea movements, along with acres of plastic ocean, an army of technicians burning naphthalene for the smoke of disaster effect, and, finally, an enigmatic figure that may be Orlando or Fellini intentionally hiding behind his own camera filming the main camera filming himself.\n\nThe main camera then tracks forward to a final shot of Orlando in a lifeboat with the rhinoceros happily munching on hay. \"Did you know,\" confides Orlando, \"that a rhinoceros gives very good milk?\" Laughing, he once again mans the oars to disappear on a vast plastic ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Freddie Jones]] as Orlando\n*[[Barbara Jefford]] as Ildebranda Cuffari\n*Victor Poletti as Aureliano Fuciletto\n*[[Peter Cellier]] as Sir Reginald Dongby\n*[[Elisa Mainardi]] as Teresa Valegnani\n*[[Norma West]] as Lady Violet Dongby\n*[[Paolo Paoloni]] as Master Albertini\n*Sarah-Jane Varley as Dorotea\n*Fiorenzo Serra as The Grand Duke\n*[[Pina Bausch]] as The Princess\n*[[Pasquale Zito]] as Count Bassano\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n*Linda Polan as Ines Ruffo Saltini\n*[[Philip Locke]] as Prime Minister\n*[[Jonathan Cecil]] as Ricotin\n*[[Maurice Barrier]] as Ilya Ziloev\n*[[Fred Williams (actor)|Fred Williams]] as Sabatino Lepori\n*[[Elizabeth Kaza]]\n*[[Colin Higgins (actor)|Colin Higgins]] as Police chief\n*[[Vittorio Zarfati]] as Second Master Rubetti\n*[[Umberto Zuanelli]] as First Master Rubetti\n*[[Claudio Ciocca]] as Second officer\n*[[Antonio Vezza]] as The Captain\n*[[Alessandro Partexano]] as Official\n*[[Domenico Pertica]] as Pastor\n*[[Christian Fremont (actor)|Christian Fremont]]\n*Marielle Duvelle\n*[[Helen Stirling]]\n*[[Janet Suzman]] as Edmea Tetua\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n:'''''The singers:'''''\n*[[Mara Zampieri]] as Ildebranda Cuffari\n*[[Elizabeth Norberg Schulz]] as Ines Ruffo Saltini\n*[[Nucci Cond\u00f2]] as Teresa Valegnani\n*[[Giovanni Bavaglio]] as Fuciletto\n*[[Carlo Di Giacomo]] as Sabatino Lepori\n*[[Boris Carmeli]] as Ilya Ziloev\n:'''''The Serbs:'''''\n*[[Elizabeth Norberg Schulz]] as 1st Soprano\n*[[Bernadette Lucarini]] as 2nd Soprano\n*[[Bruno Beccaria]] as Tenor\n:'''''Other performers:'''''\n*[[Umberto Barone]] as Scala\n*Monica Bertolotti\n*[[Danika La Loggia]]\n*[[Roberto Caporali]] as Dorotea's father\n*[[Franca Maresa]] as Dorotea's mother\n*[[Savatore Calabrese]] as Banker\n*[[Johna Mancini]] as Superintendent's secretary\n*[[Filippo Degara]]\n*[[Francesco Scali]]\n*[[Cecilia Cerocchi]] as Superintendent's wife\n*[[Pietro Fumelli]]\n*[[Franco Angrisano]] as The cook\n*[[Ugo Fangareggi]] as The bartender\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nScreened out of competition at the 40th Venice Film Festival, the film received a fifteen-minute standing ovation.<ref>Burke and Waller, xv</ref>\n\nWriting for the Italian weekly magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'', novelist and film critic [[Alberto Moravia]] saw the film as an intuitive critique of European society that preceded the First World War. \"What is brilliant,\" explained Moravia, \"is the intuition that European society of the ''Belle Epoque'' had emptied itself of all humanism leaving only an artificial and exhaustive formalism. The result was a society founded on a continuous yet contemptible melodrama. The other genial intuition is that of the fundamental unity of the world back then which was completely bourgeois or utterly obsessed with the bourgeoisie. This idea comes through magnificently in the scene where immaculate opera singers perform leaning over the iron balcony of the engine room as sweat-grimed workers cease stoking the furnace with coal to listen to the splendid voices.\"<ref>Fava, Claudio G., and Aldo Vigano, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', Citadel Press: New York, 1990, p. 187.
