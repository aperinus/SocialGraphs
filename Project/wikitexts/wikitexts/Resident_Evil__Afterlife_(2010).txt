S. Anderson]]. The film marks Anderson's return to direct in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil '' film series]], after the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]]. A direct sequel to ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' (2007), it is the fourth installment in the ''Resident Evil'' film series, which is loosely based on the [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]], and the first to be shot in [[3-D film|3D]]. It stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Ali Larter]], [[Kim Coates]], [[Shawn Roberts]], [[Spencer Locke]], [[Boris Kodjoe]], and [[Wentworth Miller]].\n\nThe film follows [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] searching for and rescuing the remaining survivors in Los Angeles after the T-virus outbreak, and teaming up against [[Albert Wesker]], the head of the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. [[Chris Redfield]], a primary character from the video games, was featured for the first time in the film franchise. Other characters from the games and films who returned are: [[Claire Redfield]], Chris's sister who has lost her memory prior to the film's events; Albert Wesker, the film's main antagonist; and [[Jill Valentine]], who made a cameo appearance.\n\nIn May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel titled ''Afterlife''. ''Extinction'' was released in 2007 and was a box office success, prompting ''Afterlife'' to begin development in June 2008, with the script being written by Anderson that December. Elements from the video game ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' (2009) were incorporated into the film including the mind control devices and Chris' confrontation with Wesker. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from September to December 2009 using the 3D [[Fusion Camera System]].\n\nThe film was released in 2D, 3D and [[IMAX 3D]] theaters on September 10, 2010, to generally negative reviews. The film grossed $60 million in the United States and Canada on an estimated $60 million budget, and made $240 million in other markets surpassing the previous film's overseas total in the second week of release. Grossing a worldwide total of $300 million, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' became the second highest-grossing entry of the series. ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' was released to DVD, [[Blu-ray]], and [[Blu-ray 3D]] on December 28, 2010, in the United States. A fifth film, ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nAlice and her clones lead the assault on Umbrella HQ, in [[Tokyo]], slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker, who escapes in a [[Tiltrotor|tiltrotor plane]] and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive [[sinkhole]]. The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to inject her with an anti-virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains.\n\nSix months later, Alice travels to [[Alaska]] in an [[Yak-52|airplane]], tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called ''Arcadia''; she only finds abandoned planes and is attacked by a feral [[Claire Redfield]]. Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of [[Los Angeles]], where they find survivors living in [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility|a prison]] surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell, Crystal Waters, Bennett, Kim Yong, and Angel Ortiz. With their help, Alice lands on the prison's roof and learns ''Arcadia'' isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, [[Chris Redfield|Chris]], who insists he's falsely imprisoned and will reveal an escape route in exchange for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up but catches Wendell attempting to [[Voyeurism|peep]]. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked by a group of infected people that dug into the prison. They take Wendell, but Alice wards off the rest.\n\nDesperate, they free Chris, who reveals that Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris, and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns, but zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, and it would take a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for ''Arcadia'' in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice and disorients the Axeman, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged into the tunnels by a zombie.\n\nAlice and the Redfields board the ''Arcadia'', discovering it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers ''Arcadia'' is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, including [[List of Resident Evil film characters#K-Mart|K-Mart]] from Claire's group. Alice follows a trail of blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes [[Cannibalism|fresh human DNA]] can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his since she retained control despite bonding with the virus at a cellular level. Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body.\n\nThe Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett, now working for Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett in the room to be devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the ''Arcadia''; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, Wesker [[Parachuting|parachutes]] away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn ''Arcadia'' into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. As Alice, Claire, and Chris watch over from ''Arcadia'', it is approached by a [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] of Umbrella aircraft.\n\nDuring a [[mid-credits scene]] in one of the aircraft, Jill Valentine, who went missing after the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|destruction of Raccoon City]], is dictating the attack wearing the same mind control device used on Claire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Alice and her clones; former Umbrella Corporation security officer turned rogue fighter, who has been captured [[Resident Evil (film)|by Umbrella scientist after escaping The Hive and being experimented upon]].

She was captured by Umbrella and brainwashed through a scarab device attached to her chest, and led the assault on Arcadia.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Wentworth Miller 2008.jpg|175px|thumb|When Miller first read the script he thought the association to ''[[Prison Break]]'' was a practical joke with his imprisonment and his first line being, \"I know a way out of here.\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/>]]\n\nIn May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel entitled ''Afterlife'', to be shot and set in Tokyo, Japan and Alaska.<ref name=\"hr1\" /> Despite ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the ''Resident Evil'' film series; on September 23, 2007, Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution explained, \"It absolutely would not surprise me considering the success of the franchise that they find a way to come up with another. It's a real possibility.\"<ref name=\"usatoday1\" /> Producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility.<ref name=\"ign1\" />  In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film.<ref name=\"mtv1\" /> In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script.<ref name=\"ign2\" /> The following year, it was announced that Sony was aiming to release ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' by August 27, 2010.<ref name=\"shock1\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:BorisKodjoeDec10.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Boris Kodjoe trained for six weeks to perform his own stunts. He dislocated his knee in the course of filming while trying to kick in a gate.<ref name=\"fearnet1\" />]]\nIn September 2006, reports indicated that casting for the fourth film had begun, with [[Jensen Ackles]] being considered for the role of [[Leon S. Kennedy]].<ref name=\"bd2\" />  Ali Larter missed seven episodes of filming the television show ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' in order to appear in the film.<ref name=\"LarterSetVisit\"/> Before Wentworth Miller was cast as Chris Redfield, actor [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] auditioned for the role. Having never played the ''Resident Evil'' video games,<ref name=\"Miller\"/> Miller began preparing for the role by searching the internet for images of Chris Redfield. Much to his surprise, he noticed how muscular the character was; with only three weeks to prep before shooting, he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent. He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different, especially in the first game. He did [[Aerobic exercise|cardio]] to build up [[endurance]].<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  Miller described his interpretation on the character from the video game as, \"He's definitely capable and heroic, but there's also something quite innocent. He was still freshly scrubbed, in a way, at the beginning of this horrifying journey.\" He described his take as the character in the film, \"My Chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time. The edges are sharper, and they're way more jagged.\"<ref name=\"FangoriaMiller\"/>\n\nShawn Roberts was originally going to audition for Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role.<ref name=\"FangoriaRoberts\"/> He went to audition for the role of Albert Wesker, a role previously played by [[Jason O'Mara]]. Describing the character Roberts said, \"[He's the] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him\u2014he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate\u2014it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans.\"<ref name=\"fearnet2\" /> Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''.<ref name=\"bd1\" /> She is featured briefly in a scene shown during the credits, setting up the [[Resident Evil: Retribution|sequel]].\n\n===Cinematography and set design===\nAnderson was shown footage of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' which sold him on the idea to shoot ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' in [[digital 3D]]. He shot in [[high-definition video|high-definition]] with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit\"/> using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more specifically a Sony F35 camera.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> The crew spent two weeks in [[pre-production]] learning the 3D camera system.<ref name=\"FangoriaDon\"/> With a budget of about $60 million,<ref name=\"Barnes (2010)\"/><ref name=\"Fritz (2010)\"/><ref name=\"variety\"/> [[principal photography]] took place for 55 days<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit\"/> from September 29, 2009,<ref name=\"collider1\" /> to December.<ref name=\"shock4\" /> Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget.<ref name=\"SetVisitBolt\"/> Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009.<ref name=\"fearnet2\" /> The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit\"/> During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.<ref name=\"ComicCon\"/>\n[[File:Robarts East wing.JPG|thumb|right|[[Robarts Library]]'s exterior was used to portray the prison.<ref name=\"GlobalNational\"/>]]\n[[File:Uoft pharmacy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy]] was used to portray Umbrella Corporation's underground Tokyo headquarters.  Anderson said \"It had a fantastic atrium that had these huge floating pill shapes in it. Inside the pills were conference rooms. We shot at night so there was no ambient light coming into the glass, and then with visual effects replaced the glass with concrete walls\".<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/>]]\nFor slow motion scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom [[high-speed camera]]s were used which filmed 200 [[frame rate|frames per second]].<ref name=\"celebritywonder\"/> A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the ''Resident Evil 5'' game was recreated shot-by-shot for the film and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film.<ref name=\"FangoriaRoberts\"/> The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers were not able to use existing equipment such as [[Steadicam]] rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a [[Segway PT|Segway]] to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot.<ref name=\"celebritywonder\" /> Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]].<ref name=\"ComicCon\"/> A 1983 [[Yakovlev Yak-52|Yak-52]] was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.<ref name=\"Plane\"/>\n\nThe 3D cameras were unable to pick up anything shiny, such as [[stainless steel]], due to a flare. [[Set decorator]] Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are \"slow to pick up information\". Loucks said, \"It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light.  So we had to add more and more black.  The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before.\"<ref name=\"CalLoucks\"/>\n\n===Filming locations===\nPrincipal photography was done mostly at [[Cinespace Film Studios]] in Toronto, [[Ontario]].<ref name=\"Cinespace\"/> Toronto police received hundreds of calls from concerned neighbors after a scene involving a burning plane crashed.<ref name=\"GlobalNational\"/>  For the underwater scenes, [[cargo]] [[Intermodal container|shipping containers]] were cut and welded to make a giant tank on stage.<ref name=\"SetVisitBolt\"/> The opening scene was filmed at Cinespace Film Studios.<ref name=\"celebritywonder\"/> Interior scenes of Umbrella Corporation's subterranean lair were filmed at the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy.<ref name=\"PopularMechanics\"/> Robarts Library was used to portray exterior shots of a Los Angeles prison due to its resemblance to a prison, and other scenes were shot at [[University of Toronto Scarborough]].<ref name=\"GlobalNational\"/> Scenes portraying an Alaskan [[aircraft boneyard]] were actually filmed at [[Oshawa Airport]]. A location depicting an Alaskan beach was filmed at [[Sandbanks Provincial Park]].<ref name=\"Sandbank\"/> [[Second unit]] was sent to Alaska to capture [[establishing shot]]s of the scenery.<ref name=\"FangoriaAnderson\"/>\n\n===Visual and special effects===\n[[Visual effects]] were done by [[Rocket Science VFX]] and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones served as the [[special effect]]s creator, who previously designed the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] character in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production.<ref name=\"FangoriaSetReport1\"/> For Alice's clones they shot [[motion control photography]] for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles.<ref name=\"FangoriaDennis\"/> Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described the look of the film, \"interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]''.
