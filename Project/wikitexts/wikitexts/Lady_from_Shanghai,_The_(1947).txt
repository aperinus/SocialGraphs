Three hooligans waylay the coach. Michael rescues Elsa and escorts her home. Michael reveals he is a seaman and learns Elsa and her husband, disabled criminal defense attorney Arthur Bannister, are newly arrived in New York City from Shanghai. They are on their way to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] via the [[Panama Canal]]. Michael, attracted to Elsa despite misgivings, agrees to sign on as an able seaman aboard Bannister's yacht.\n\nThey are joined on the boat by Bannister's partner, George Grisby, who proposes that Michael \"murder\" him in a plot to fake his own death. He promises Michael $5,000 and explains that since he would not really be dead and since there would be no corpse, Michael could not be convicted of murder (reflecting ''[[corpus delicti]]'' laws at the time). Michael agrees, intending to use the money to run away with Elsa. Grisby has Michael sign a confession.\n[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer welles.JPG|thumb|left|Welles as Michael O'Hara in ''The Lady from Shanghai'' (1947)]]\n\nOn the night of the crime, Sydney Broome, a private investigator who has been following Elsa on her husband's orders, confronts Grisby. Broome has learned of Grisby's plan to murder Bannister, frame Michael, and escape by pretending to have also been murdered. Grisby shoots Broome and leaves him for dead. Unaware of what has happened, Michael proceeds with the night's arrangement and sees Grisby off on a motorboat before shooting a gun into the air to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile, Broome, mortally wounded but still alive, asks Elsa for help. He warns her that Grisby intends to kill her husband.\n\nMichael makes a phone call to Elsa, but finds Broome on the other end of the line. Broome warns Michael that Grisby was setting him up. Michael rushes to Bannister's office in time to see Bannister is alive, but that the police are removing Grisby's body from the premises. The police find evidence implicating Michael, including his confession, and take him away.\n\nAt trial, Bannister acts as Michael's attorney. He feels he can win the case if Michael pleads justifiable homicide. During the trial, the incompetent judge quickly loses control of the proceedings. Bannister learns of his wife's relationship with Michael. He ultimately takes pleasure in his suspicion that they will lose the case. Bannister also indicates that he knows the real killer's identity. Before the verdict, Michael escapes by feigning a suicide attempt (swallowing pain relief pills Bannister takes for his disability), causing a commotion in which he slips out of the building with the jury for another case. Elsa follows. Michael and she hide in a [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] theater. Elsa calls some Chinese friends to meet her. As Michael and Elsa wait and pretend to watch the show, Michael realizes that she killed Grisby. Michael passes out from the pills he took just as Elsa's Chinese friends arrive; they carry the unconscious Michael to an empty [[fun house]]. When he wakes, he realizes that Grisby and Elsa had been planning to murder Bannister and frame him for the crime, but that Broome's involvement ruined the scheme and that Elsa had to kill Grisby for her own protection.\n\nThe film features a unique climactic shootout in a [[House of mirrors|hall of mirrors]] involving a multitude of false and real mirrored images in the Magic Mirror Maze, in which Elsa is mortally wounded and Bannister is killed. Heartbroken, and ignoring Elsa's pleas to save her life, Michael leaves presuming that events which have unfolded since the trial will clear him of any crimes. \"Maybe I would live so long I'd forget her. Maybe I'd die trying\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rita Hayworth]] as Elsa \"Rosalie\" Bannister\n**singing voice was dubbed by [[Anita Ellis (singer)|Anita Kert Ellis]]\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Michael O'Hara\n* [[Everett Sloane]] as Arthur Bannister\n* [[Glenn Anders]] as George Grisby\n* [[Ted de Corsia]] as Sidney Broome\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Judge\n* [[Gus Schilling]] as \"Goldie\" Goldfish\n* Carl Frank as District Attorney Galloway\n* Louis Merrill as Jake\n* [[Evelyn Ellis]] as Bessie\n* [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Cab Driver\n* [[Errol Flynn]] as Man in Background Outside of Cantina (uncredited) \n* Philip Morris as Port Steward/Officer Peters (uncredited) \n* [[Edward Peil Sr.]] as Guard (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles was directing ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'', a musical stage adaptation of the [[Jules Verne]] novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'', with a comedic and ironic book by Welles, incidental music and songs by [[Cole Porter]], and production by [[Mike Todd]], who would later produce the successful [[Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film)|film version]] with [[David Niven]]. When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles financed it. When he ran out of money and urgently needed $55,000 to release costumes that were being held, he convinced [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]] to send him the money to continue the show and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce and direct a film for Cohn for no further fee.\n\nAs Welles told it, on the spur of the moment, he suggested the film be based on a book that he happened to see in front of him during his call with Cohn, one a girl in the theatre box office was reading at the time. Welles had never read it.<ref>Interview with Orson Welles, 1982, Arena, [[BBC]] Television</ref> However, according to the daughter of [[William Castle]], it was her father who had purchased the film adaptation rights for the novel and who then asked Welles to pitch it to Cohn, with Castle hoping to receive the directoral assignment himself. She described her father as greatly respecting Welles' talents, but feeling nonetheless disappointed at being relegated to serve merely as Welles' assistant director on the film.<ref>Documentary.

Cohn strongly disliked Welles' rough cut, particularly what he considered to be a confusing plot and lack of close-ups (Welles had deliberately avoided these, as a stylistic device), and was not in sympathy with Welles' [[Brechtian]] use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. He also objected to the appearance of the film. Welles had aimed for documentary-style authenticity by shooting the film almost entirely on location (making it one of the first major Hollywood pictures to be shot in this way) in [[Acapulco]], [[Pie de la Cuesta, Guerrero|Pie de la Cuesta]], [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]] and [[San Francisco]]), and by using primarily long takes, while Cohn preferred the more tightly controlled look of footage lit and shot in a studio. The release of the film was delayed due to Cohn's order for extensive editing and reshoots. Whereas Welles had delivered his cut of the film on time and under budget, the reshoots Welles was ordered to do meant that the film ended up over budget by a third, contributing to the director's reputation for going over budget. Once the reshoots were over, the heavy editing ordered by Cohn took over a year to complete; editor [[Viola Lawrence]] cut about an hour from Welles' rough cut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80637/The-Lady-from-Shanghai/articles.html |title=The Lady from Shanghai (1948) |author=James Steffan |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=April 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325124358/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80637/The-Lady-from-Shanghai/articles.html |archive-date=March 25, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|author-link=Gene D.

Intended as a climactic tour-de-force of editing and production design, the scene was cut to less than three minutes out of an intended running time of twenty minutes. As with many of the films over which Welles did not have control over the final cut, the missing footage has not been found and is presumed to have been destroyed. Surviving production stills show elaborate and expensive sets that were built for the sequence and which were entirely cut from the film.<ref>Jean-Paul Berthom\u00e9 and Francois Thomas, ''Orson Welles at Work'', London: Phaidon Press, 2008, pp. 128\u2013142.</ref>\n\nWelles cast his wife [[Rita Hayworth]] as Elsa and caused a good deal of controversy when he instructed her to cut her long red hair and bleach it blonde for the role. \"Orson was trying something new with me, but Harry Cohn wanted The Image\u2014The Image he was gonna make me 'til I was 90,\" Rita Hayworth recalled. \"''The Lady from Shanghai'' was a very good picture.

Not long after the film's release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce. A remake of the film came close to production at the turn of the century from a screenplay written by [[Jeff Vintar]], based both on Welles's script and the original pulp novel, produced by [[John Woo]] and [[Terence Chang]], and starring [[Brendan Fraser]], who wanted [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] to co-star. Although the screenplay was considered highly successful, and Fraser was coming off the highly praised ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'', the project was abandoned when the head of Sony Pictures, [[Amy Pascal]], decided to concentrate on teen films.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Filming locations===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Zaca-Hayworth-Birthday-1946.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Aboard the ''Zaca'', [[Errol Flynn]], [[Nora Eddington]], Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles celebrate Hayworth's 28th birthday (October 1946)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Errol Flynn's Zaca.jpg\n |alt2      =\n| caption2  = The {{USS|Zaca|IX-73|2}} in 2006\n}}\n\nIn addition to the [[Columbia Pictures]] studios, the film was partly shot on location in San Francisco.
