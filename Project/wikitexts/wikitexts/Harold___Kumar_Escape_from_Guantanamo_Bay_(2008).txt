The sequel to ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'' (2004), it is the second installment in the [[Harold & Kumar|''Harold & Kumar'' franchise]], and stars [[John Cho]], [[Kal Penn]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. The film follows Harold Lee (Cho) and Kumar Patel (Penn) as their planned trip to [[Amsterdam]] is derailed after being wrongly imprisoned at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].\n\nOriginally considered as a [[direct-to-video]] release, Hurwitz and Schlossberg signed on for the film by January 2007, with Cho, Penn, and Harris returning soon after. [[Principal photography]] also began that month and concluded in March 2007, with filming locations including [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and Amsterdam. Prior to release, the film faced backlash for its comedic portrayal of Guantanamo Bay, with [[Amnesty International]] mounting a campaign to highlight the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp#Camp conditions and testimonies of abuse and torture|testimonies of abuse and torture]] made by the camp's detainees.\n\n''Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay'' was theatrically released in the U.S. on April 25, 2008, by [[Warner Bros.]], the first [[New Line Cinema]] title released after the studio's [[New Line Cinema#Merger with Warner Bros.|acquisition]] by Warner Bros. The film received mixed critical reception, with praise for the performances of Cho, Penn, and Harris, although some found it inferior to its predecessor. Conversely, the film was better received by audiences, and has gained a [[cult following]]. It was also a commercial success, grossing over $43 million worldwide. The sequel, ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas]]'', was released internationally in November 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter returning home from [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], Harold Lee and Kumar Patel decide to travel to [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] so Harold can surprise his neighbor and love interest Maria. At the airport, the duo encounters Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Fanning, who is engaged to Colton Graham, a college friend of Harold's whose family has political connections. The plane passengers mistake Kumar's new invention, a smokeless [[bong]], for a [[bomb]] and the duo is apprehended by [[sky marshal]]s. Ron Fox, a neurotic and extremely racist Deputy [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], believes the duo are agents of a joint [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[North Korea]]n conspiracy and sends them to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]] against the advice of [[NSA]] Vice-Chairman Dr. John Beecher. After narrowly avoiding sexual assault by a guard at the detention camp due to the inadvertent assistance of two other prisoners, Harold and Kumar escape and board a Cuban refugee boat to [[Miami, Florida]]. They meet up with their college friend, Raza, at his home, who loans them a car so they can travel to [[Texas]], hoping Colton can help clear their names.\n\nHarold and Kumar endure several misadventures on their way to Texas, first crashing their car into an African-American neighborhood in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] (in which the neighborhood offer to help), staying at the home of an incestuous sibling couple and their inbred son, then afterward escaping a [[Ku Klux Klan]] rally. Meanwhile, Fox tries to find them through several racist interrogation techniques. As Harold and Kumar hitchhike through a forest, they are picked up by [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who manages to get them through a checkpoint set up by Fox, but then takes them to a brothel, where the mistress then shoots Harris for branding one of the prostitutes. When Harold and Kumar reach Texas, Colton agrees to help exonerate the duo. However, upon seeing Kumar reconnect with Vanessa, Colton instead delivers Harold and Kumar to Fox.\n\nOn the flight back to prison, Harold and Kumar manage to subdue Fox's men with a can of mace belonging to Harris and their fists, but Fox holds them at gunpoint, until Beecher intervenes, telling Fox that it's because of people like him that the rest of the world thinks Americans are racist and stupid. Beecher promises to get Harold and Kumar cleared, but trips and accidentally opens the cabin door, sucking out him, Harold, and Kumar. Harold manages to grab a parachute and he pulls it open for him and Kumar just as Fox falls by to his death, having jumped after them (without a parachute) to finish them off. Harold and Kumar land through the roof of a luxurious ranch, which turns out to be [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s estate. After befriending and smoking [[kush (cannabis)|kush]] with Harold and Kumar, the duo explains their misadventures and Bush gives them both a presidential pardon, and also gets the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to escort the pair to Vanessa and Colton's wedding.  They expose Colton's betrayal to Vanessa and the guests, and Colton attempts to attack them, but Harold knocks him out. Kumar consoles a furious Vanessa by reciting a poem he wrote for her in college, and they reconcile. Harold, Kumar and Vanessa then travel to Amsterdam where Harold finds Maria, and the couples happily tour the city together while getting high on cannabis. A post-credits scene shows Harris coming to after being presumed dead outside the brothel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[John Cho]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Harold Lee|Harold Lee]], a Korean-American stoner and investment banker; Kumar Patel's best friend and roommate\n* [[Kal Penn]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Kumar Patel|Kumar Patel]], an Indian-American stoner and medical student; Harold Lee's best friend and roommate \n* [[Danneel Harris]] as Vanessa Fanning, Kumar's ex-girlfriend and Colton's fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Ron Fox, a neurotic and racist Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Dr. John Beecher, the Vice Chairman of the [[NSA]] who acts as the rational counterpoint in relation to Fox.\n* [[Eric Winter]] as Colton Graham, Vanessa's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Neil Patrick Harris|a fictionalized, drug-addled, whoremongering version of himself]].\n* [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]] as Maria, Harold's love interest.\n* {{ill|Amir Talai|simple}} as Raza Syed, a college friend of Harold and Kumar living in Miami\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Goldstein]]\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as [[Harold & Kumar#Rosenberg and Goldstein|Rosenberg]]\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Grand Wizard (credited as Reverend Clyde Stanky)\n* [[Richard Christy]] as Kenny\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Mr. Lee\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Sally\n* [[Jon Reep]] as Raymus\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Interpreter\n* Adam Herschman as Archie\n* [[Jack Conley (actor)|Jack Conley]] as Deputy Frye\n* [[Tamara Feldman]] as Chloe\n* Ava Santana as Tammi\n* Randal Reeder as Robert \"Big Bob\" Clemens\n* [[James Adomian]] as a fictionalized, drug-addicted and womanizing [[George W.
