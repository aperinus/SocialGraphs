Bush]] for more than a year on his campaign trail in the [[2000 United States presidential election]].\n\nWorking for [[NBC]] and as part of what she calls the \"travelling [[press corps]],\" Pelosi offers the only behind-the-scenes look at Bush's campaign.  With light [[journalism]], she achieves considerable access to the then-[[Governor of Texas]].\n \nThe film focuses on the relationship between the press and presidential candidates, the life of a traveling journalist in such a relationship, and Bush, usually in a humorous light, with less attention given to the issues. It earned six [[Emmy]] nominations including one win for Lubarsky's editing. It scored 48 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>''[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/journeys-with-george]'', Metacritic.</ref> In April 2007, it was shown on [[MSNBC]].\n\nThe last two seasons of ''[[The West Wing]]'', which follow the presidential campaigns of [[Matt Santos]] and [[Arnold Vinick]], were inspired in part by scenes in ''Journeys''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0312848}}\n* [https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/catalog.journeys-with-george Journeys with George] on [[HBO]]\n\n{{Alexandra Pelosi}}\n{{George W.
