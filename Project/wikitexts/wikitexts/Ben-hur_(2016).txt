It is the fifth [[film adaptation]] of the 1880 novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' by [[Lew Wallace]] following the [[Ben Hur (1907 film)|1907 silent short film]], the [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|1925 silent film]], the [[Academy Award]]-winning [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|1959 film]] and the [[Ben Hur (2003 film)|2003 animated film]]; it is the third version produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It has been termed a \"re-adaptation\", \"reimagining\", and \"new interpretation\" of the novel, and follows [[Judah Ben-Hur]], a young prince who is falsely accused by his step-brother, an officer of the [[Roman army]], and is sent to slavery, only to escape and seek vengeance.<ref name=\"TA\"/><ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The film stars [[Jack Huston]] as the titular character, alongside [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Nazanin Boniadi]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. [[Principal photography]] began on February 2, 2015, in [[Matera, Italy]] and lasted about five months, finishing in June 2015.\n\n''Ben-Hur'' premiered on August 9, 2016, in [[Mexico City]] and was theatrically released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on August 19, 2016, in the United States in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[RealD 3D]], [[Digital 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/ben-hur|title=Ben-Hur|work=imax.com|date=23 June 2016 |publisher=[[IMAX Corporation]]|access-date=7 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705173924/http://www.imax.com/movies/ben-hur|archive-date=5 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It received generally negative reviews and was a [[box-office bomb|box office failure]], grossing $94 million worldwide against its $100 million production budget plus a large amount spent on marketing and distribution.<ref name=VSS/><ref name=SM/>\n\n==Plot==\nJewish prince [[Judah Ben-Hur]] and his adopted Roman brother Messala are best friends despite their different origins. After Judah's mother resists Messala's interest in her daughter Tirzah, Messala enlists in the Roman army and achieves glory. Ben-Hur eventually marries his slave [[Esther (character)|Esther]] after Messala leaves. Three years later, Messala returns as a decorated Roman officer. His return coincides with a rising insurrection by the [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealots]], Jews opposed to Roman rule. Ben-Hur begrudgingly treats and shelters a young Zealot named Dismas and attempts to dissuade him from the cause. Messala reunites with Ben-Hur and attempts to convince him to serve as an informant - the new governor Pontius Pilate is coming to Jerusalem and Messala does not want any revolt.  Judah claims he will talk to the locals.\n\nDuring Pilate's march, Dismas attempts to assassinate Pilate from Judah's balcony. The Romans storm Ben-Hur's household and arrest him and his family. Rather than betray Dismas, Ben-Hur takes responsibility for the assassination attempt and his mother and sister are sentenced to crucifixion. While being led to the prison galley, Ben-Hur encounters [[Jesus of Nazereth|Jesus]], who gives him water. Ben-Hur then endures five years of slavery as a rower aboard a Roman prison galley. During a battle against Greek rebels in the [[Ionian Sea]], Ben-Hur's galley is boarded, collides with another ship and is destroyed. Ben-Hur manages to free himself and floats on a ship mast. He is washed ashore and found by [[Sheik Ilderim]], who recognizes him as an escaped slave. Ben-Hur manages to convince Ilderim not to hand him over to the Romans by treating one of Ilderim's racing horses. After Ben-Hur develops a bond with the four racing horses, a grateful Ilderim then trains Ben-Hur to be a chariot racer.\n\nBen-Hur and Ilderim travel to Jerusalem to take part in a [[chariot racing|chariot race]]. Jesus' preaching ministry draws the attention of governor Pilate and Messala, who is now the commander of the Roman garrison and a champion chariot racer. While visiting Jerusalem, Ben-Hur encounters Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus and is involved in charity work. Esther tells Ben-Hur that his mother and sister are dead, and despite their reunion, the two are kept emotionally apart due to her new cause, which is contrary to his insistence on seeking revenge against Messala.\n\nBen-Hur confronts Messala alone in their former home but is forced to flee when Roman soldiers turn up. After the Romans execute twenty Jews in reprisal, Esther completely falls out with Ben-Hur. Just before the race, Ben-Hur encounters a former Roman soldier named Druses, who informs him that his mother Naomi and sister Tirzah are still alive. However, their reunion is soured when Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister have [[leprosy]], and Ben-Hur is enraged at their condition.\n\nIlderim convinces Pilate to allow Ben-Hur to compete by proposing a high wager against Messala. Esther tries to convince Messala not to race Ben-Hur, but he is adamant that he will win. On the day of the race, Ben-Hur follows Ilderim's instructions to hold back from the race until the final laps. Using dirty tactics, Messala manages to knock out the other charioteers. After Messala attempts to destroy Ben-Hur's chariot, their chariots become stuck.  When Messala tries to kick Ben-Hur from his chariot, his chariot breaks loose and he is trampled.  Judah wins, the Jewish spectators begin attacking the Romans and Judah is carried away.\n\nDespite his victory, Ben-Hur is despondent about his family and Messala's fate. Esther is with Jesus in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]; later she and Ben-Hur witness Jesus bearing the cross. Mirroring his first encounter with Jesus, Ben-Hur tries to offer Jesus water but is beaten by a Roman soldier. Esther and Judah witness Jesus' death on the cross, Naomi and Tirzah are miraculously healed and Ilderim pays a ransom to set them free. Ben-Hur seeks out an injured Messala who initially swears to continue hunting Judah.  After experiencing Judah's kindness and forgiveness, Messala relents and they reconcile.  Judah and Messala return to his family who all leave Jerusalem with Ilderim.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 175\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: [[Jack Huston]], [[Toby Kebbell]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] star in the film as, respectively, [[Judah Ben-Hur]], Messala, and [[Sheik Ilderim]].\n   | image1    = Jack Huston by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Toby Kebbell by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n   | image3    = Morgan Freeman, 2006 (cropped).jpg\n   | alt3      =\n   | caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Jack Huston]] as [[Judah Ben-Hur]]:\n:A Jewish prince in [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|Roman-occupied Jerusalem]] who is betrayed and falsely accused of treason, and is sentenced to a life of slavery.

The film's Malaysian distributor, [[United International Pictures]] Malaysia, has since confirmed that the cuts were made to fulfil local legal requirements and guidelines.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Ida|title=Censorship board: We didn't cut Jesus scenes from Ben-Hur|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/censorship-board-we-didnt-cut-jesus-scenes-from-ben-hur|access-date=18 September 2016|newspaper=[[The Malay Mail]]|date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918161440/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/censorship-board-we-didnt-cut-jesus-scenes-from-ben-hur|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nTwo exclusive photos of the film were released by ''[[USA Today]]'' on March 14, 2016.<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/14/ben-hur-movie-sneak-peek/81731732|title=Sneak peek: Jack Huston takes reins of new 'Ben-Hur'|author=Brian Truitt|work=USA Today|date=14 March 2016|access-date=15 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315092218/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/14/ben-hur-movie-sneak-peek/81731732/|archive-date=15 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> On March 15, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' released a world exclusive premiere of some of the scenes of the chariot race,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.etonline.com/movies/184595_exclusive_world_premiere_watch_epic_chariot_race_from_the_new_ben_hur/|title=Watch Epic Chariot Race From the New 'Ben-Hur'|author=Raphael Chestang|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|date=15 March 2016|access-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160318081853/http://m.etonline.com/movies/184595_exclusive_world_premiere_watch_epic_chariot_race_from_the_new_ben_hur/|archive-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and on the following day, the first official trailer was released online,<ref name=\"Scott\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-ben-hur-reboot-trailer-876172|title=First 'Ben-Hur' Reboot Trailer Arrives|author=Mia Galuppo|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=16 March 2016|access-date=17 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318175355/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/first-ben-hur-reboot-trailer-876172|archive-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> along with a teaser poster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/ben-hur-2016-trailer-poster|title=Ben-Hur Trailer & Poster: Stand and Fight|author=Sandy Schaefer|work=Screenrant|date=16 March 2016|access-date=17 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317022115/http://screenrant.com/ben-hur-2016-trailer-poster/|archive-date=17 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe trailer was released a week after Paramount released ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' in theaters.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> Although Paramount did not secure a [[Super Bowl commercials|Super Bowl commercial spot]] for the film, Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' felt that it was an appropriate film to advertise before [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]]' faith-based ''[[Miracles from Heaven]]'' opened on March 16.<ref name=\"Scott\"/> The trailer garnered a polarized reception from critics and audiences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11607165|title=New Ben-Hur trailer 'a crime against God'|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|access-date=17 March 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160318081834/http://m.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11607165|archive-date=18 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/biggest-studio-gambles-of-the-summer-from-ghostbusters-to-ben-hur|title=Biggest Studio Gambles of the Summer, From 'Ghostbusters' to 'Ben-Hur'|author=Jeff Sneider|work=[[The Wrap]]|date=8 April 2016 |access-date=8 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411022813/http://www.thewrap.com/biggest-studio-gambles-of-the-summer-from-ghostbusters-to-ben-hur/|archive-date=11 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2896918/ben-hur-backlash-why-the-trailer-upset-so-many-people|title='Ben-Hur' Backlash: Why the Trailer Upset So Many Peoole|author=Tony Matthews|work=[[Inquisitr]]|date=17 March 2016|access-date=12 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520035226/http://www.inquisitr.com/2896918/ben-hur-backlash-why-the-trailer-upset-so-many-people/|archive-date=20 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> with comparisons being made to ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'',<ref name=\"LYT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2016/03/16/ben-hur-trailer-emphasizes-action-not-jesus/#5a64d0497ba7|title='Ben-Hur' Trailer Emphasizes Action, Not Jesus|author=Luke Y.
