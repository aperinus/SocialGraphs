Cameron goes on to express his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, which include his beliefs that atheists have tried to \"take the holiday away\" and that [[Santa Claus]] is a Christian. Cameron also criticizes [[fundamentalist Christian]]s who have politicized the holiday by tying the celebration to [[Pagan]] traditions and making accusations that the holiday has become too tied to [[materialism]].\n\nThe film switches to its main narrative, in which Cameron attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. There, he notices that his brother-in-law, Christian, is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why Christian tells Cameron that he feels the holiday became too commercialized and [[consumerist]], and that he feels uncomfortable with what he believes are Pagan elements of contemporary Christmas celebration. Cameron tells Christian that he is wrong and recites the story of [[the Nativity]], which is depicted in cartoon form. Meanwhile, two guests at the party discuss [[conspiracy theories]].\n\nChristian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably [[Christmas tree]]s, are not biblical in origin. Cameron tells him that Christmas trees were God's idea since God created trees. He also says that each tree represents a [[Christian cross]]; [[breaking the fourth wall]], Cameron encourages the audience to visualize a cross every time they see a Christmas tree. Cameron further addresses several other concerns Christian has about the historicity of the holiday, including its date and the role of the [[Three Wise Men]]. Cameron ties the Nativity directly to the [[crucifixion]], saying that baby Jesus' swaddling cloth was a foreshadowing of his burial shroud, and claims that the gifts of [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] were used to treat dead bodies in a form of primitive [[embalming]]. Cameron encourages Christian and the audience to place [[nutcracker doll]]s around Nativity sets to represent [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s soldiers during the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].\n\nChristian is convinced by the arguments, but then complains that Santa has replaced Jesus as the figurehead of the holiday; he further expresses discomfort over the fact that \"Santa\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Satan\". Cameron tells Christian the story of [[Saint Nicholas]], including a reenactment of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in which Nicholas had supposedly violently assaulted [[Arius]] for heresy. Cameron claims that, after the council, Nicholas went out and began beating other heretics for teaching false doctrine, and that \"Nicholas was 'bad', in a good way\". Cameron explains that St. Nicholas was the basis for Santa Claus, who was a byproduct of Nicholas' story being diluted by [[secular]] culture. With this knowledge, Christian joyously declares that \"Santa is the man\".\n\nReassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Cameron criticizes people who feel that the holiday is too commercial, saying that because God took on material form, it is appropriate to celebrate using material things through the giving of expensive gifts. Cameron explains that presents represent [[Jerusalem]], and that Christmas is \"doing what God does\", as God has given humanity many gifts. Cameron then issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, \"for our children\". Christian, as a gift to his wife, organizes a [[hip hop]] dance to symbolize his love of Christmas, set to \"[[Angels We Have Heard on High]]\". Cameron, Christian, and all the party guests [[breakdance]] in an extended musical sequence. Cameron then tells everyone to feast and suggests the audience organize the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget it is a celebration of God.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kirk Cameron]] as himself\n* [[Darren Doane]] as Christian White, Kirk's brother-in-law\n* Bridgette Ridenour as Kirk's sister\n* David Shannon as Diondre\n* Raphi Henly as conspiracy theorist\n* Ben Kientz as [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nick]]\n\n==Release==\n''Saving Christmas'' debuted on 410 screens on November 14, 2014.\n\n===Box office===\nOn its first weekend, the film came in fifteenth place with ticket sales of $992,087, with a per screen average of $2,420.
