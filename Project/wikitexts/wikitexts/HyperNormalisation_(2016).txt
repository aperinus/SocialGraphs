It argues that governments, financiers, and [[technological utopians]] have, since the 1970s, given up on the complex \"real world\" and built a simpler \"fake world\" run by corporations and kept stable by politicians. The film was released on 16 October 2016 on [[BBC iPlayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rts.org.uk/article/new-adam-curtis-film-hypernormalisation-comes-iplayer|date=22 September 2016|author=Holly Barrett|accessdate=15 October 2016|title=New Adam Curtis film HyperNormalisation comes to iPlayer|publisher=Royal Television Society}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''hypernormalization'' was coined by [[Alexei Yurchak]], a professor of anthropology who was born in [[Leningrad]] and later went to teach in the United States. He introduced the word in his book ''Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation'' (2006), which describes paradoxes of [[Soviet]] life during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/adam-curtiss-essential-counterhistories|title=Adam Curtis's essential counterhistories|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016|author=Brandon Harris|newspaper=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Yurchak |first=Alexei |date=23 October 2005 |title=Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation |series=(In-Formation) |url=https://archive.org/details/everythingwasfor0000yurc |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691121178 |url-access=registration }}</ref> He says that everyone in the Soviet Union knew the system was failing, but no one could imagine an alternative to the [[status quo]], and politicians and citizens alike were resigned to maintaining the pretense of a functioning society.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07z7zq8|subject=Adam Curtis|interviewer=Jarvis Cocker|date=16 October 2016|work=Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service|title=With documentary film-maker Adam Curtis|location=London|publisher=BBC Radio 6 Music|access-date=17 October 2016}}</ref> Over time, this delusion became a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] and the fakeness was accepted by everyone as real, an effect that Yurchak termed ''hypernormalisation''.<ref name=\"KlumbyteSharafutdinova2012\">{{cite book|author1=Neringa Klumbyte|author2=Gulnaz Sharafutdinova|title=Soviet Society in the Era of Late Socialism, 1964\u20131985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=628u2gG4XXcC&pg=PA213|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7584-2|page=213}}</ref>\n\n==Chapters==\nThe film contains nine chapters, and is composed primarily of [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] with [[voice-over]].\n\n===1975===\nThe [[History of New York City (1946\u201377)#Fiscal crisis|fiscal crisis]] in [[New York City]] and the emergent idea that [[financial system]]s could run society; [[shuttle diplomacy]] between then-US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] and Middle Eastern leaders in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli dispute]] and the subsequent retreat by [[Hafez al-Assad]] of [[Syria]]; and the onset of hypernormalisation in the Soviet Union.\n\n===The Human Bomb===\nFollowing the United States' involvement in the [[1982 Lebanon War]], a vengeful al-Assad made an alliance with [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] of [[Iran]]. They planned to force the US out of the [[Middle East]] by encouraging civilians to carry out [[suicide bombing]]s on American targets in the region, thereby avoiding reprisals. In February 1984, the US withdrew all its troops from [[Lebanon]] because, in the words of then-US Secretary of State [[George P. Shultz]], \"we became paralysed by the complexity that we faced\".\n\n===Altered States===\nBy the mid-1980s, banks and corporations were connecting through computer networks to create a hidden system of power, and [[technological utopians]] whose roots lay in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] also saw the internet as an opportunity to make an alternative world that was free of political and legal restraints.\n\n===Acid Flashback===\n[[John Perry Barlow]]'s vision of [[cyberspace]] as the 1990s equivalent of the [[Acid Tests]]. Barlow had been part of the [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (also known as \"acid\") counterculture in the 1960s and founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. He wrote a manifesto called [[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace]]. Addressed to politicians, it declared \"the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose upon us\". Two computer hackers\u2014[[Mark Abene|Phiber Optik]] and [[Elias Ladopoulos|Acid Phreak]]\u2014knew that in reality corporations were using the internet to exert more control over the lives of people than governments had done in the past, and they demonstrated that hierarchies did exist online by obtaining Barlow's [[credit record]] from [[TRW Inc.]] and posting it on the internet.\n\n===The Colonel===\nThis chapter describes the [[Reagan administration]] using [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as a pawn in their [[public relations]] (PR) strategy of creating a simplified, morally unambiguous foreign policy by blaming him for the [[1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks]] and the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]] that killed US soldiers, both of which European security services attributed to Syrian intelligence agencies. Gaddafi is described as playing along for the sake of increasing his profile in the [[Arab world]] as a revolutionary. The [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]], 10 days after the disco bombing, is described as an operation carried out mainly for PR reasons, because attacking Syria would have been too risky.\n\n===The Truth Is Out There===\n{{see also|Paul Bennewitz|Mirage Men}}\nThis chapter begins with a montage of [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) sightings recorded by members of the public in the United States. It argues that the phenomenon surrounding UFOs in the 1990s was born out of a [[counter-intelligence]] operation designed to make the public believe that secret airborne high-technology weapons systems tested by the US military during and after the [[Cold War]] were alien visitations. Top secret memos forged by the [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] were allegedly leaked to [[ufologists]] who spread the manufactured [[conspiracy theory]] of a government cover-up to the wider public. The method, called [[perception management]], aimed to distract people from the complexities of the real world. American politics are described as having become increasingly detached from reality. Curtis uses the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] at the end of the 1980s as an example of an event that took [[Western Bloc|the West]] by surprise because reality had become less and less important. A [[Jane Fonda]] [[Jane Fonda's Workout|workout video]] is shown to illustrate that [[socialists]] had given up trying to change the real world and were instead focusing on the self and encouraging others to do the same. The video is intercut with footage of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] and his wife, [[Elena Ceau\u0219escu|Elena]], being executed by firing squad and buried following the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989.\n\n===Managed Outcomes===\n[[Ulrich Beck]] is identified as a left-wing German political theorist. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he saw the world as too complex to change, and Beck asserted that politicians should merely keep the West stable by predicting and avoiding risks. Curtis looks at [[Aladdin (BlackRock)|Aladdin]], a computer that manages about 7% of the world's financial assets, analysing the past to anticipate what may happen in the future; and how [[anti-depressant]] drugs and [[social media]] both stabilise the emotions of individuals.\n\n===A Cautionary Tale===\nThe start of this chapter is about the flaws of trying to predict the future by using data from the past. Curtis tells the story of how a [[Card counting|card counter]] was recruited by [[Donald Trump]] to analyse the gambling habits of [[Akio Kashiwagi]] at his casino, the [[Trump Taj Mahal]] in [[Atlantic City]], after Trump had lost millions of dollars to Kashiwagi. In an effort to avert the impending bankruptcy of the casino, a model was devised that predicted a way of recouping the money from Kashiwagi, who lost US$10&nbsp;million. However, before he could pay, he was killed by [[yakuza]] gangsters and the casino went bankrupt, with Trump having to sell many of his assets to the banks.\n\nAttention turns back to the Middle East and the [[Lockerbie Bombing]] in 1988. Curtis says that immediately after the bombing, journalists and investigators blamed Syria for carrying out the attack on behalf of Iran in revenge for the shooting down of [[Iran Air Flight 655]] by the [[United States Navy]].{{efn|Lebanese involvement has also been suggested.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/27/lockerbie.features11|title=Flight from the truth\n|author1=John Ashton|author2=Ian Ferguson|date=27 June 2001|accessdate=5 October 2018|website=The Guardian}}</ref>}} It was generally accepted as true until US security agencies announced that Libya was behind the attack. Some journalists and politicians believed that the West had made the [[volte-face]] to appease Syria's leader, who the US and the United Kingdom required as an ally in the coming [[Gulf War]].\n\nHe focuses on the spread of suicide bombing tactics from [[Shia Islam|Shia]] to [[Sunni Islam]] and the targeting of civilians in [[Israel]] by [[Hamas]] during the 1990s. The resulting political paralysis led to a stalling of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]]. It is described as an [[unintended consequence]] of Israel's response to the 1992 killing of an Israeli border guard.\n\nA montage is shown of clips from pre-[[9/11]] disaster films in which [[New York City]] landmarks are variously destroyed by alien invaders, [[meteorites]], and a [[tsunami]]. Curtis argues that such films were characteristic of a mood of uncertainty that pervaded the United States at the end of the 20th&nbsp;century.\n\nCurtis shows how [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was turned into the West's \"new best friend.\"\n\n===A World Without Power===\nThe effect of the [[Iraq war]] wreaks havoc on the American psyche and people retreat into cyberspace. [[Judea Pearl]] creates [[Bayesian networks]] that mimic human behaviour. Judea's son, [[Daniel Pearl]] is the first American to be beheaded on a video uploaded to [[YouTube]].\n\nMeanwhile, social media algorithms show information that is pleasing to their users and hence does nothing to challenge their beliefs. Despite this, [[Occupy Wall Street]] emerges in an attempt to disrupt the system by imitating the leaderless system that the internet was once imagined to become. Using a similar method, the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]] commenced.\n\nBritain, France and the US turn their backs on [[Muammar Gaddafi]] once Libyans rise up against him. The US drops bombs using drones, and then footage is shown of Gaddafi being captured by rebels.\n\nNeither Occupy Wall Street nor the [[Arab Spring]] turn out very well for the revolutionaries.\n\nIn Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]] and his cabinet of political technologists create mass confusion. [[Vladislav Surkov]] uses ideas from art to turn Russian politics into a bewildering piece of theatre. Donald Trump used the same techniques in his presidential campaign by using language from Occupy Wall Street. Curtis asserts that Trump \"defeated journalism\" by rendering its fact-checking abilities irrelevant.\n\nThe American Left's attempt to resist Trump on the internet had no effect. In fact, they were just feeding the social media corporations who valued their many additional clicks.\n\nSyria's revolution becomes more vicious and violent. The technique of suicide bombing that Curtis argues [[Hafez al-Assad]] introduced in order to unite the Middle East has instead torn it apart. Russia uses Surkov's concept of \"non-linear warfare\" to fight against the Syrian rebels. Russia claims to leave Syria, but doesn't.\n\n[[Abu Musab al-Suri]] in Syria suggests that terrorists should not carry out large-scale attacks such as [[Osama Bin Laden]]'s, but instead carry out \"random\" small-scale attacks throughout the West to create fear and chaos, against which it would be more difficult to retaliate.\n\nDestabilisation of the West's psyche leads to the vote for [[Brexit]] and the popularity of Donald Trump.\n\n==Music==\nMusic used at any stage or repeatedly includes:\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Scuba Z]] \u2013 The Vanishing American Family\n*[[Nine Inch Nails]] \u2013 Something I Can Never Have\n*\"02 Ghosts I\" from ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' by [[Nine Inch Nails]]\n*[[Yanka Dyagileva]] \u2013 My Sorrow is Bright\n*[[Dmitri Shostakovich]] \u2013 [[Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2]]: VI.
