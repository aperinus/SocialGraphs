He cheerfully whistles \"[[Steamboat Bill]]\" and sounds the boat's three whistles. Soon the real captain, [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], appears and orders Mickey off the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Mickey blows a raspberry at Pete. Pete attempts to kick him, but Mickey rushes away in time and Pete accidentally kicks himself in the rear. Mickey rushes down the stairs, slips on a bar of soap on the boat's deck, and lands in a bucket of water, whereupon a parrot laughs at him, and Mickey throws the bucket on its head.\n\nPete, who has been watching the whole thing, pilots the steamboat himself. He bites off some [[chewing tobacco]] and spits into the wind. The spit flies backward and rings the boat's bell. Amused by this, Pete spits again, but this time the spit hits him in the face, making him fuss.\n\nThe steamboat makes a stop at \"Podunk Landing\" to pick up a cargo of various livestock. Just as they set off again, [[Minnie Mouse]] appears, running to catch the boat before it leaves. Mickey does not see her in time, but she runs after the boat along the shore and Mickey takes her on board by hooking the cargo crane to her bloomers.\n\nLanding on deck, Minnie accidentally drops a ukulele and some sheet music for the song \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\", which are eaten by a goat. The two mice use the goat's body as a [[phonograph]], which they play by turning its tail like a crank. Mickey uses various objects on the boat as percussion accompaniment and \"plays\" the animals like musical instruments. This ends with Mickey using a cow's teeth and tongue to play the song as a xylophone.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salys |first1=Rimgaila |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDk8d2UMRLwC&q=%22Steamboat+Willie%22+%22turkey+in+the+straw%22&pg=PA86 |title=The Musical Comedy Films of Grigorii Aleksandrov |year=2009 |isbn=9781841502823 |oclc=548664422 |access-date=November 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220320055440/https://books.google.com/books?id=cDk8d2UMRLwC&q=%22Steamboat+Willie%22+%22turkey+in+the+straw%22&pg=PA86 |archive-date=March 20, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=June 7, 1979 |editor-last=Dixon |editor-first=Bernard |title=Perpetual Youth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-EEANKOC6kC&q=%22Steamboat%20Willie%22%20%22turkey%20in%20the%20straw%22&pg=PP1 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |volume=82 |issue=1158 |pages=832\u2013834 |issn=0028-6664 |oclc=964677385 |access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url= |title=The New Illustrated Treasury of Disney Songs |publisher=[[Hal Leonard]] |others=Walt Disney Pictures |year=1998 |isbn=0-7935-9365-4 |edition=5th |oclc=57245282}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Pete is unamused by the musical act and puts Mickey to work peeling potatoes. In the potato bin, the same parrot that laughed at him earlier appears in the porthole and laughs at him again. Fed up with the bird's heckling, Mickey throws a half-peeled potato at it, knocking it back into the river below. The film ends with Mickey laughing as he sits next to the potatoes.\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to [[Roy O. Disney]], Walt Disney was inspired to create a sound cartoon after watching ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927).<ref name=\" IMDb\" /> Disney created cartoons starring Mickey Mouse in secret while he fulfilled his contract for another series, [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. However, the first two ''Mickey Mouse'' films produced, silent versions of ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', had failed to impress audiences and gain a [[Film distributor|distributor]]. Disney believed that adding sound to a cartoon would greatly increase its appeal.\n\n''Steamboat Willie'' was not the first cartoon with synchronized sound. Starting in May 1924 and continuing through September 1926, [[Dave Fleischer|Dave]] and [[Max Fleischer|Max Fleischer's]] [[Fleischer Studios|Inkwell Studios]] produced 19 sound cartoons, part of the ''[[Song Car-Tunes]]'' series, using the [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process. However, the ''Song Car-Tunes'' failed to keep the sound fully synchronized, while ''Steamboat Willie'' was produced using a [[click track]] to keep his musicians on the beat.<ref name=Finch>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christopher |title=The Art of Walt Disney from Mickey Mouse to the Magic Kingdom |year=1995 |publisher=Harry N.

In the aftermath, Powers hired a former DeForest technician, William Garrity, to produce a cloned version of the Phonofilm system, which Powers dubbed \"Powers Cinephone\". By then, DeForest was in too weak a financial position to mount a legal challenge against Powers for patent infringement. Powers convinced Disney to use Cinephone for ''Steamboat Willie''; their business relationship lasted until 1930, when Powers and Disney had a falling-out over money, and Powers hired away from Disney's lead animator, [[Ub Iwerks]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Dialogue==\nMickey, Minnie and Pete perform in near-pantomime, with growls and squeaks but no intelligible dialogue. The only dialogue in the film is spoken by the ship's parrot. When Mickey falls into a bucket of soapy water, the bird says, \"Hope you don't feel hurt, big boy! Ha ha ha ha ha!\" At the end of the short, the parrot repeats the phrase, and after it falls in the water, it cries, \"Help! Help!

The audience sat in a room adjoining Walt's office. Roy placed the movie projector outdoors and the film was projected through a window so that the sound of the projector would not interfere with the live sound. [[Ub Iwerks]] set up a bedsheet behind the movie screen behind which he placed a microphone connected to speakers where the audience would sit. The live sound was produced from behind the bedsheet. [[Wilfred Jackson]] played the music on a [[mouth organ]], Ub Iwerks banged on pots and pans for the percussion segment, and Johnny Cannon provided sound effects with various devices, including [[slide whistle]]s and [[spittoon]]s for bells. Walt himself provided what little dialogue there was to the film, mostly grunts, laughs, and squawks. After several practices, they were ready for the audience, which consisted of Disney employees and their wives.\n\nThe response of the audience was extremely positive, and it gave Walt Disney the confidence to move forward and complete the film. He said later in recalling this first viewing, \"The effect on our little audience was nothing less than electric. They responded almost instinctively to this union of sound and motion. I thought they were kidding me. So they put me in the audience and ran the action again. \"It was terrible, but it was wonderful! And it was something new!\" Iwerks said, \"I've never been so thrilled in my life. Nothing since has ever equaled it.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16227115 |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |publisher=New American Library |year=1987 |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |edition=Revised |location=New York |pages=34\u201335 |oclc=16227115}}</ref>\n\nWalt Disney traveled to New York City to hire a company to produce the sound system.

Legal experts noted that later versions of Mickey Mouse created after ''Steamboat Willie'' will remain copyrighted and Disney's recent use of the ''Steamboat Willie'' version as a logo in its modern movies may allow them to claim protection for the 1928 version under [[trademark]] law, as active trademarks can be renewed in perpetuity (so long as the owner can prove using it).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mart\u00edn |first=Hugo |date=May 11, 2022 |title=Republicans took away Disney's special status in Florida.

The unnamed character appears in the credits as \"Steamboat Willie\".\n\nIn the 2001 Mickey Mouse cartoon ''Mickey's April Fools'', Mickey and Mortimer get sent to the President's office to claim a million dollars; Mortimer pretends to be Mickey, and he is shown acting in ''Steamboat Willie''.\n\nIn [[Toontown Online]], one of the buildings on Silly Street is named \"Steamboat Willie\".\n\nIn the Goofy cartoon ''How to Be a Waiter'' (1999), Goofy is shown as an example of a movie, and ''Steamboat Willie'' is shown. But in that short, ''Willie'' is a shortened version titled ''Steamboat Goofy''.\n\nThe opening scene is parodied near the end of ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996). [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], having been swallowed by the giant turtle which carries the Vanishing Isle upon its back, comes back out of the turtle's mouth in the steamboat from this film and is even in Mickey's form, whistling \"Turkey in the Straw\".\n\nIn the 2008 movie of the TV series ''[[Futurama]]'' called ''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'', the opening is a parody of ''Steamboat Willie''.\n\nThe beginning of season 2 of the TV series ''[[Alexei Sayle's Stuff]]'' (1989) shows a black-and-white animation entitled ''Steamboat Fatty'', a parody of ''Steamboat Willie''.\n\nIn the ''[[List of Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl episodes|Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl]]'' anime, one of the episodes, \"Steamboat Willies!\", is a play on the title.\n\nSince the release of ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'' (2007), the scene of Mickey at the ship's wheel whistling \"Steamboat Bill\" has been used for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' [[production logo]]. A \"milestone\" modification was used for ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010) and ''[[Encanto]]'' (2021), with text saying \"[[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]: 50th/60th Animated Motion Picture\" with the Mickey scene in the number \"0\"; the ''[[Encanto]]'' version using a shortened version.
