Two of his passengers are killed, while he and his girlfriend Kelly survive. The crash leaves Chris with lasting mental impairments, including [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[anger management]] issues.\n\nFour years later, Chris takes classes to learn new skills, including the simple sequencing of daily tasks to compensate for his inability to remember, and keeps notes to himself in a small notebook. Challenged by a tough case manager to build a life despite his injuries, he is emotionally supported by his roommate, a blind man named Lewis, but receives only financial support from his wealthy family. Chris works nights cleaning a small-town bank, and his only friend besides Lewis is Ted, a Sheriff's Deputy who checks in on Chris regularly. Chris repeatedly tries to convince the bank's manager, Mr. Tuttle, to allow him to apply for a teller job, to no avail.\n\nChris comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. Their leader Gary, who knew Chris from high school and resented his wealth and popularity before his accident, befriends him and uses a young woman, Luvlee Lemons, to seduce him. Taunted by the gang about his limitations since the accident, Chris initially goes along with their scheme. His frustrations trickle down into confrontations with Lewis and Ted.\n\nWhen the gang arrives the night of the robbery, Chris tells them he has changed his mind, but is forced to empty the vault at gunpoint. Bringing Chris doughnuts, Ted stumbles upon the robbery. Realizing they've been discovered, one of the robbers, Bone, begins shooting. Ted kills two of the robbers, Marty and Cork, and seriously wounds Gary before Bone maneuvers around and shoots Ted in the back, executing him with a second shot. Escaping in the getaway car, Chris realizes he has the stolen money, and is compelled to return to the site of his accident, where he buries the money. Gary, seriously wounded, escapes with Bone. Returning to his apartment, Chris sees the lights on and realizes something is wrong. He calls and learns Gary and Bone have taken Lewis hostage to get the money back. Chris, using his new sequencing skills, hatches a plan to stay alive and save his friend, but the robbers catch him napping at the arranged meeting place and force him to take them to the buried cash.\n\nWhile Chris digs in the snow for the money, Gary's condition deteriorates. Chris gives one of the two bags to Bone, who is preparing to execute Lewis, but Chris kills Bone with the shotgun stashed in the other bag. Gary collapses and dies. Chris returns the money and turns himself in, but the [[FBI]] investigation concludes that he was not responsible due to his mental condition and, because the robbers failed to disconnect the video surveillance, the FBI was able to see Chris was forced to act at gunpoint.\n\nChris and Lewis reconcile and open a restaurant together with a loan from the bank. Chris hopes Kelly will forgive him for the loss of her leg in the accident and that one day he will find the courage to talk to her again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Chris Pratt\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Lewis\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Gary Spargo\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Robert Pratt, Chris's father\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as \"Luvlee\" Lemons, a woman Gary uses to seduce Chris\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Janet, Chris's caseworker\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Barbara Pratt, Chris's mother\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Mrs. Lange\n* [[Sergio Di Zio]] as Deputy Ted\n* David Huband as Mr. Tuttle\n* [[Laura Vandervoort]] as Kelly\n* Greg Dunham as \"Bone\"\n* [[Morgan Kelly]] as Marty\n* Aaron Berg as \"Cork\"\n\n==Production==\nAlthough set near Kansas City, Missouri, the bank in the movie was filmed in the town of [[Hartney, Manitoba]], using the town's Museum, and city scenes were filmed in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].
