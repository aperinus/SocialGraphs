Upon her return, Prairie calls herself \"the OA\" (for \"original angel\"), has scars on her back, and can see, despite having been blind when she disappeared. The OA refuses to tell the [[FBI]] and her adoptive parents where she has been and how her eyesight was restored, and instead quickly assembles a team of five locals (four high school students and a teacher) to whom she reveals that information, also explaining her life story. Finally, she asks for their help to save the other missing people whom she claims she can rescue by opening a portal to [[Parallel universes in fiction|another dimension]].<ref name=\"Gilbert2019\">{{cite news |last1=Gilbert |first1=Sophie |title=The Radical Sincerity of The OA |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/the-return-of-the-oa-tvs-strangest-most-sincere-show/585208/ |access-date=21 April 2019 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=March 19, 2019 |archive-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402084647/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/03/the-return-of-the-oa-tvs-strangest-most-sincere-show/585208/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Part II===\nThe second season follows the OA as she traverses to another dimension and ends up in [[San Francisco]] to continue her search for her former captor Hap and her fellow captives. Prairie crosses paths with [[Private investigator|private eye]] Karim Washington and assists in his investigation of the surreal disappearance of a missing girl that involves an abandoned house with a supernatural history and an online puzzle game. Meanwhile, in the original dimension, a series of unfortunate events propels the OA's five companions to embark on a road trip across America to assist the OA on her journey.\n\n==Cast==\nThe

Prairie disappeared blind, but now she can see, and insists that her name is \"the OA\". She does not reveal how she regained her eyesight, nor where she has been for the past seven years, although she makes vague allusions to being held hostage with others. OA tells Steve, a neighborhood bully, that she will save him from being sent to [[Boot camp (correctional)|boot camp]] in Asheville, if he presents her with four other strong people. That night, OA meets Steve in an abandoned house with three other boys from his school, \"French\", Buck, and Jesse, along with their teacher, Betty Broderick-Allen (\"BBA\"). She tells them that she was born in [[Russia]] as Nina Azarova, the daughter of a powerful [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]]. One day, following a premonition she had, the mafia knocked the bus of the oligarchs' children into a river. Nina had a [[near-death experience]] (NDE), where a woman named Khatun gave her the choice of returning to life. Nina came back blind after Khatun told her she would take her sight to protect her from the horrible things lying ahead.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Chapter 2: New Colossus\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = [[Melanie Marnich]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = Continuing her story, OA says that her father sent her to a [[boarding school]] for blind children in America to protect her. However, her father died, and she was sent to live with her aunt who ran an illegal adoption service. Nancy and Abel adopted her and named her Prairie. For the next several years, Prairie had dreams and premonitions, for which her parents [[Antipsychotic|medicated]] her. In them, her father waited for her by the [[Statue of Liberty]]. She ran away on her 21st birthday to see him, but he did not appear. Instead, she met a scientist named \"Hap\". She ends her story for the night, and the boys begin to investigate whether she is telling the truth. French considers not going again when he gets a scholarship and wishes to focus on that, but Buck convinces him to come. The next night, she tells them that Hap was studying people that had NDEs, like she did. Prairie agreed to let Hap study her and flew on his private plane to his house, where he trapped her in a glass cage in his basement, with the other test subjects he had tricked over the years.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Chapter 3: Champion\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = Brit Marling & Dominic Orlando\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the present, a journalist approaches Prairie's mother, asking if she can write a book about their story. In the flashback, Prairie gets to know Homer, Scott and Rachel, the other three captives. Prairie makes Hap a sandwich, and he takes her on as a cook. He regularly pumps gas to their cages as part of an experiment, but the four cannot figure what that is, as the gas makes them pass out. BBA defends Steve from being sent to Asheville, convincing his parents to put him in [[special education]] instead. Prairie makes soup for Hap, who experiences anaphylactic shock when he eats it. He asks her to get an [[EpiPen]] from the bathroom, but there she discovers the dead body of a girl \"August\". The captives try to send a letter for help, but lose it. Prairie asks Hap about August but becomes angry, pushes him down the stairs, and flees.

She is offered the choice of reuniting with her father but she chooses to return to help the others. Khatun, who shows she has a bird wing, offers Prairie to swallow a bird which will show her a way of traveling unknown to humans. She tells Prairie that five of them must work together to avert a great evil and that Prairie is \"the original\". Hap returns Prairie to her cage, and she tells the others that she can see, that they are all [[angels]], and that their way out is by figuring out Hap's experiment. In the present, BBA learns her brother Theo left her $50,000 in his will. OA meets an FBI counselor, Elias, who suggests to her that she focus on healing herself. In her story, Prairie and Rachel decide to suck Hap's [[Hyoscine#Crime|scopolamine-like]] gas so that Homer experiences the experiment awake. Hap is revealed to be drowning them in water and recording the soundscape of their NDEs. It takes Homer four years, but he experiences an NDE awake, in which he manages to swallow a sea anemone.

Hap forces Homer to seduce an NDE survivor in [[Cuba]] named Renata, to kidnap her. Homer ends up sleeping with her, which destroys the morale of the team and hurts OA. With Renata now locked up back at Hap's, it is Scott's turn for the experiment. Scott begs Hap to spare him because he is too sick to survive another NDE and reveals OA can see as well as her ideas about angels and how to escape. Hap proceeds with the experiment, and Scott dies. Hap takes his body back to his cage, telling OA it is her fault. OA and Homer do their movements for hours, while facing each other with Scott in the middle. Unexpectedly, Scott returns to life and tells them they were right; if at least five people perform the movements, a door to another dimension opens. He has been given the third of five. Hap runs downstairs in shock that Scott is alive.

Hap visits his former mentor, Leon, in a morgue, in which Leon also runs similar experiments. Leon tells Hap he is very close to proving the existence of an [[afterlife]], but Hap tells him he actually believes there are multiple dimensions and that his subjects have the means to make traveling between them possible. He also thinks he knows where their NDEs take place, and he intends to go see it with his own eyes. Leon pulls a gun on Hap demanding he reveals his breakthroughs. They fight, and Hap kills him. Hap leaves the hospital and informs the staff to call the police to rescue Leon's subjects. Later, he asks OA to leave with him, make money using the first two healing movements, and run experiments on their own, but she turns him down. He reveals to her he thinks her NDEs take her to the [[rings of Saturn]]. A sheriff pays Hap a visit and discovers the hostages.

She discusses it with Elias, who suggest that her \"psychic\" capability might be the result of being able to notice even the smallest cues around her. He also tells her to just accept whatever happens. Steve is being sent to Asheville but BBA uses her inheritance check to bribe the drivers to let him go. OA has dinner with her parents, when Nancy gets upset that she knows nothing about what happened to her daughter. OA explains that she scarred herself with the notations of the movements that open another dimension and she knows all this because she is \"the original angel\", which causes Nancy to slap her. French suggests to OA that she forgive Nancy and Abel and consider them as her parents because they are one of the reasons she came back from her NDEs. Steve accuses OA of using him and the rest of the group just so she can return to Homer, then stabs her leg with a pencil. She embraces him and calms him down.

Once healed, the sheriff's wife reveals she is an NDE survivor and can give them the fifth movement. Upon doing so, Hap kills her and her husband. He releases OA on the side of the road, telling her he will jump dimensions with the others. French breaks into OA's house, discovers some books that relate to OA's story (e.g., [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''), and shares the revelation with the others. Days later, a [[School shooting|shooter]] approaches the school cafeteria where the boys are eating lunch. The boys and BBA, fearing for the lives of all present, desperately decide to enact OA's five movements. Bewildered, the shooter is easily subdued, but a stray bullet hits OA through the cafeteria window where she had been watching from outside.

The group then treks there, but the vanity accidentally gets broken. At the psychic's house, she helps Rachel come into contact with the group through a television.

Prairie heads to the bar as Nina, alongside Karim, who looks for more clues in the venue.
