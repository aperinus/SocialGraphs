Plympton]], [[Basil Dickey]], and Barry Shipman and was adapted from [[Alex Raymond]]'s syndicated [[Flash Gordon|newspaper comic strip of the same name]] from [[King Features Syndicate]]. Shown theatrically in 12 separate weekly \"chapters\", it was the last of the three Universal Flash Gordon serials made between 1936 and 1940.\n\nDuring the 1950s, all three Flash Gordon serials were syndicated to television by Motion Pictures for Television, along with many of Universal's other serial output. To avoid confusion with the [[Flash Gordon (1954 TV series)|imported Flash Gordon TV series]] airing around the same time, they were retitled ''Space Soldiers'', ''Space Soldiers' Trip to Mars'', and ''Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe''.\n\nIn 1966 ''Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe'' was edited down by [[King Features Syndicate]] into two feature-length films for television syndication: ''[[Purple Death from Outer Space]]'' and ''Perils from the Planet Mongo''. In the early 1970s, a third feature version was re-edited for the [[16 mm]] home movie market, using story material taken from the entire serial. It bore the title ''Space Soldiers Conquer the Universe'' and later appeared on television during the 1980s. Afterward, all three edited feature-length versions became available through various public-domain video sellers, first on VHS [[videotape]] and later on [[DVD]].\n\nIn the mid-1970s all three complete Universal Flash Gordon serials were shown chapter-by-chapter by [[PBS]] stations across the U.S., bringing them to a new generation of science fiction fans, two years before ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. From the late 1980s onward, all three serials became available on the home video market under their original theatrical release titles, chapters, and running times.\n\n==Plot==\nA deadly plague is ravaging the Earth, known as the Purple Death because of a purple spot left on victims' foreheads. Flash Gordon learns that [[Ming the Merciless]] is behind the plague when he spots one of Ming's spaceships spreading the \"Death Dust\" in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nFlash Gordon, along with [[Hans Zarkov|Dr. Alexis Zarkov]] and [[Dale Arden]], return to the planet [[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]] to find a possible cure, first seeking the assistance of their old friend [[Prince Barin]]. The trio continue to battle Ming and his allies, led by henchman Captain Torch, who has been charged with stopping the Earthlings by any means.\n\nThe three eventually find an antidote, called [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|Polarite]], in Mongo's remote northern Kingdom of Frigia. They must now get the cure back to Earth in sufficient quantities to stop the ravaging plague. Ming sends in an army of robot bombs, and he succeeds in capturing Zarkov and Dale. After their capture, Flash must return to Earth to distribute the antidote by rocketship, the very same way the original Death Dust was first spread.\n\nUpon his return to Mongo, Flash is able to free Zarkov and Dale. They continue their struggles against Ming, Captain Torch, and his men through a series of close encounters, deadly escapes, and rescues, all the while continuing to thwart Ming and his allies.\n\nMing and his minions are eventually locked away by one of his men in the high control tower of his castle. Unknown to them, Flash is piloting a rocketship that is speeding directly toward that tower. He parachutes away just in the nick of time, and in a daring aerial maneuver Flash is successful in boarding Barrin's nearby rocketship, which has Dale and Zarkov aboard. Flash's  unmanned spaceship is actually a flying bomb, having been loaded with highly volatile [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles|Solarite]]. Its rapid forward momentum carries it directly into the castle's control tower, where the large explosion that follows ends Ming's tyrannical reign forever. Prince Barin soon takes his rightful place as the peaceful ruler of Mongo.\n\nMing's last words to Flash were \"I am the universe!\" Zarkov observes that with Ming's death \"Flash Gordon has conquered the universe\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940) 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Film still|Publicity still]] with Carmen D'Antonio and Charles Middleton.]]\n\n* [[Buster Crabbe]] as [[Flash Gordon]]\n* [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] as [[Dale Arden]]\n* [[Frank Shannon]] as [[Hans Zarkov|Dr. Alexis Zarkov]]\n* [[Charles B.
