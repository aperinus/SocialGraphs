They celebrate with Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant.\n\nThe next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone who looks at them. Everyone hypnotized person becomes zombie-like and immobilized, and are then collected by the light machines. This is the work of several alien ships that descend from the sky. Jarrod is about to be taken when Terry tackles him. The two escape the alien drones and meet up with Elaine.\n\nBack in the condominium, Terry looks for his neighbor Walt so they can all leave in Walt's car. As Terry and Walt are hiding, Walt's dog runs towards the creature. Walt tries to stop it and gets abducted. Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are no machines over the sea. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and Jen, also preparing to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage, it is flattened by a massive four-legged alien, killing Denise. Terry escapes, but is abducted as he flees. The trio retreat into the garage. There they encounter another alien lifeform in the shape of a large multi-tentacled squid that corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV. In the ensuing fight, the squid creature sucks out Colin's brain to replace its own brain. Jen joins the group, but is abducted as they run back into the building. The four survivors remain hiding in the condominium.\n\nThe next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack against the alien spaceship and flying alien drones using stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles and conventional drone aircraft. Only one stealth plane pierces the carnage and fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership, before it is destroyed. The detonation blows the ship apart. Unfortunately, the aliens survive and the ship slowly begins to repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod physically starts changing, lifts Oliver off the floor and vows to protect his family.\n\nRemaining US Navy ships and Helicopters arrive at LA with soldiers as Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to catch a ride to safety but the helicopter is attacked by the tanker and destroyed. Oliver and Candice stay in the condominium but are found when Candice accidentally exposes herself to the light and is abducted but the squid alien is killed by a US Army soldier. Afterwards, Oliver attempts to kill a tanker alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine. The badly injured Jarrod kills it. They try to escape from the remaining tanker. An FB-22 Strike Raptor spots it and tries to save them but is attacked by an alien drone And destroyed. The jet almost hits Jarrod and Elaine but instead crashes into the tanker and the pilot is killed. Jarrod is too badly injured to keep moving and tells Elaine to go by herself but she stays with him as they watch F-22s and FB-22s being blown out of the sky and the mothership getting closer to them.  With no hope left they accept their fate, look into the blue light, and are sucked into the mother ship. A brief montage shows that cities such as [[London]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[New York City]] have all succumbed to the invasion and the aliens appear to have won and defeated the last remaining US Navy Ships at LA.\n\nInside the alien ship, Elaine wakes on a pile of human bodies. Tubes are sucking human brains into machines. Probes go through the pile looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed and transported to a chamber with other pregnant women. She watches as another pregnant woman has her baby removed and dies. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain, glowing red, is inserted into a new alien body. Animating the body, Jarrod seems to retain control and comes to the aid of Elaine, who recognizes him when he caresses her belly and her head. He then turns around to confront advancing aliens. In the credits, a series of still images depict \"Jarrod\" protecting Elaine and their [[Beyond Skyline|child from the aliens]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Jarrod\n* [[Scottie Thompson]] as Elaine\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Candice\n* [[Crystal Reed]] as Denise\n* [[Neil Hopkins]] as Ray\n* [[David Zayas]] as Oliver\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Terry\n* [[Robin Gammell]] as Walt\n* Tanya Newbould as Jen\n* [[J.

Sony paid Hydraulx to generate visual effects work for ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]''. But Hydraulx never informed Sony the siblings were directing a rival alien invasion feature, similarly driven by special effects, scheduled for release four months prior to Sony's feature. A representative for the Strauses issued a statement: \"Any claims of impropriety are completely baseless. This is a blatant attempt by Sony to force these independent filmmakers to move a release date that has long been set by Universal and Relativity and is outside the filmmakers' control\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/battle-over-l-a-alien-invasion-films/|title=Battle Over L.A.
