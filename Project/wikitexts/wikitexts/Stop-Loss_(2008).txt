It was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by [[MTV Films]]. The film received mixed reviews,<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> and earned less than half of its $25 million production budget at the box office. The title refers to the U.S. government's controversial [[stop-loss policy]], which allows the government to extend the term of duty of soldiers who have already served their contracted number of years of service.\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Staff sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Brandon King leads a squad stationed in [[Tikrit]] during the [[Iraq War]]. The film begins with footage from the tour of the squad, explaining they have 28 days before returning to the United States. While on duty at a checkpoint, the squad hears gunshots, after which a car speeds past filled with insurgents, one of whom fires an AK-47 at them. King's men jump into their Humvees and follow the insurgents into an alley. When the soldiers get out of their vehicles, the insurgents ambush them from rooftops.\n\nAs the firefight ensues, a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG) is discharged, destroying one of the Humvees, killing two soldiers inside. Shortly after, another RPG is discharged, exploding an Iraqi vehicle. Squad member PFC Tommy Burgess is unfortunately near the vehicle when the RPG is discharged but another soldier, Pvt. Rico Rodriguez, dives on Burgess and saves him. This is at the expense of severely wounding Pvt. Rodriguez. Shortly after, fellow squad member Paul \"Preacher\" Colston, a close friend of Tommy, is shot in the neck and jaw in front of Tommy, and is killed instantly.\n\nLater, when Staff Sergeant King enters a house to help injured long-time friend and squad member Sgt. Steve Shriver, he discovers that he had accidentally killed several Iraqi civilians by throwing a grenade to kill an insurgent in a room, unaware of any civilians present in the area. Brandon is visibly shocked and the ambush ends with three soldiers killed.\n\nUpon returning to their [[Texas]] hometown of [[Brazos, Texas|Brazos]], Brandon and Steve are decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in a solemn ceremony. A U.S. Senator takes Brandon aside after the ceremony and offers to help Brandon in any way he can. That night, Steve shows the effects of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. He gets drunk and digs a foxhole in his front yard, and strikes his fianc\u00e9e Michelle in the face. When Brandon comes over to check on Steve, he is unable to get through to him. Tommy drives over drunk after his wife has kicked him out.\n\nThe next day, Brandon suggests that they all go to the \"ranch\", a small forest cabin located outside of town. The men pass the time by drinking and watching Tommy shoot his wedding gifts, after their friend Shorty reads the cards. Upon hearing the commotion, a hungover Steve awakens and shoots the cards to silence them and to show his skills in sniping. The next day, Brandon, Tommy and Steve report to their military base. When Brandon arrives expecting to be discharged, he is unexpectedly ordered back to active duty in [[Iraq]], based on the military's controversial [[stop-loss policy]], which required soldiers who had fulfilled their required tours of duty to return to the war. He refuses to comply and goes [[AWOL]], becoming a deserter.\n\nMichelle sympathizes with Brandon's refusal and offers to travel with him to Washington, D.C. to see the Senator who offered to assist Brandon earlier. During a multi-day drive to Washington, D.C., Brandon calls the Senator's office and is told that because he is now a fugitive, the Senator is not interested in seeing him. Brandon and Michelle also visit the family of Paul \"Preacher\" Colson, one of the three soldiers under Brandon's command killed in the alley ambush and encounter another AWOL soldier who recommends a lawyer to help arrange forged discharge documents so he could establish a new identity in Canada.\n\nThey also visit Rico Rodriguez, a soldier who was [[blindness|blinded]], lost his right arm and leg, and sustained facial burns from saving Tommy from a rocket-propelled grenade, previously during the ambush in Iraq. After Michelle phones Steve to tell him of their exact location, he arrives in uniform to take Brandon back, and tells Michelle he has volunteered to return to Iraq. Brandon refuses to return and Michelle is furious with Steve for re-enlisting and ends their relationship. Brandon and Michelle finally reach New York City and meet with the lawyer, who gives Brandon forged papers and a passport which would allow him to flee to Canada in exchange for payment of $1,000. Tommy, who is [[clinical depression|depressed]] after being discharged from the army, commits [[suicide]], Brandon returns to visit Tommy's grave immediately after the funeral, only to end up in a dispute with Steve, ultimately turning into a physical battle ending with Brandon leaving the cemetery and Steve weeping.\n\nBrandon, his mother and Michelle drive to the [[Mexican border]], but Brandon ultimately decides that he does not want to abandon everything that he has ever known. He also tells his mother and Michelle that if he goes to Mexico he'll never really be able to leave the war behind him. The final scene depicts a busload of soldiers, including Brandon and Steve, returning to the war.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Staff Sergeant Brandon Leonard King\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Michelle Overton\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Sergeant Steve Shriver\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Private First Class Tommy Burgess\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Lieutenant Colonel Boot Miller\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Private Rico Rodriguez\n* [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]] as Isaac \"Eyeball\" Butler\n* Terry Quay as Paul \"Preacher\" Colson\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Senator Orton Worrell\n* [[Linda Emond]] as Ida King\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Roy King\n* [[Mamie Gummer]] as Jeanie Burgess\n* [[Alex Frost]] as \"Shorty\" Shriver\n* [[Tory Kittles]] as Josh\n* [[Steven Strait]] as Michael Colson\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began in August 2006 in [[Morocco]] and various locations in Texas \u2013 [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Lockhart, Texas|Lockhart]], [[San Antonio]] and [[Uhland, Texas|Uhland]].
