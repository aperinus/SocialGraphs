Set in the 17th century, it depicts the adventures of a [[Jesuit priest|Jesuit]] [[missionary]] tasked with founding a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] in [[New France]]. To do so, he must traverse 1500 miles of harsh wilderness with the help of a group of [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]], facing danger from both the unfamiliar environment and rival tribes. The title refers to the nickname given to the Jesuits by the Algonquins, referring to his black [[cassock]].\n\nThe film stars [[Lothaire Bluteau]] in the title role, with other cast members including [[Aden Young]], [[Sandrine Holt]], [[Tantoo Cardinal]], [[August Schellenberg]], [[Gordon Tootoosis]] and [[Raoul Trujillo]]. It was the first official co-production between a Canadian film team and an [[Australia]]n one. It was shot mostly in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite magazine|last=Stratton|first=David|date=9 September 1991|title=Black Robe|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789325.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=65}}</ref> It was Young and Holt's film debut.\n\n''Black Robe'' premiered at the [[1991 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was given a wide release on 6 October, becoming the highest-grossing Canadian film of 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Black Robe {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/black-robe|access-date=2021-02-10|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}</ref> It received generally positive reviews and won several accolades. It was nominated for ten [[Genie Awards]] and won six, including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Beresford), [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Moore), and [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Schellenberg). It was also nominated for ten [[AACTA Awards]], with [[Peter James (cinematographer)|Peter James]] winning [[AACTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Canada (New France)|New France]] in 1634 (in the period of conflicts known as the [[Beaver Wars]]), the film begins in the settlement that will one day become [[Quebec City]]. [[Jesuit]] missionaries are trying to encourage the local [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] [[First Nations in Canada|Indians]] to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. [[Samuel de Champlain]], founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young [[Jesuit]] priest, to found a [[Mission (Christian)|Catholic mission]] in a distant [[Wyandot people|Huron]] village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles (2414 kilometers).\n\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] [[First Nations in Canada|Indians]] whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina \u2013 an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\n\nThe group meet with a band of [[Innu people|Montagnais]], First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais [[shaman]], Mestigoit, is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a demon. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.\n\nAs they recover LaForgue, a party of [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] attack them, killing most of the Algonquin, amongst them Chomina's wife, and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are forced to [[Gauntlet (punishment)|run the gauntlet]], watch Chomina's young son be killed, and are told they will be slowly tortured to death the next day. That night Annuka seduces their guard, allowing him to engage in coitus with her. When this distracts him she strikes him with a caribou hoof, rendering him unconscious and allowing them to escape. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, sees a small grove he has dreamed of many times before, and realizes it is the place he is destined to die. LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. As Chomina freezes to death in the snow, he sees the ''[[Manitou|She-Manitou]]'' appearing to him.\n\nAs the weather grows colder, Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a [[smallpox]] epidemic. The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by [[baptizing]] them. LaForgue confronts the Hurons.\n\nWhen their leader asks LaForgue if he loves them, LaForgue thinks of the faces of all the Indians he has met on his journey, and answers \"Yes\".  The leader then asks him to baptize them, and the Hurons receive his baptism. The film ends with a golden sunrise. An intertitle states that fifteen years later, the Hurons, having accepted Christianity, were routed and killed by their enemies the Iroquois; the Jesuit mission to the Hurons was abandoned and the Jesuits returned to Quebec.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Lothaire Bluteau]] as Father Paul LaForgue\n*[[Aden Young]] as Daniel Davost\n*[[Sandrine Holt]] as Annuka\n*[[August Schellenberg]] as Chomina\n*[[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Chomina's Wife\n*[[Billy Two Rivers]] as Ougebmat\n*Lawrence Bayne as Neehatin\n*Harrison Liu as Awondoie\n*Wesley C\u00f4t\u00e9 as Oujita\n*[[Frank Wilson (Australian actor)|Frank Wilson]] as Father Jerome\n*Fran\u00e7ois Tass\u00e9 as Father Bourque\n*Jean Brousseau as [[Samuel de Champlain]]\n*Yvan Labelle as Mestigoit\n*[[Raoul Trujillo]] as Kiotseaton\n*James Bobbish as Ondesson\n*[[Gordon Tootoosis]] as Old Aneons\n*Denis Lacroix as Taratande\n*Marthe Turgeon as LaForgue's mother\n*[[Claude Pr\u00e9fontaine]] as Old Priest\n*Deano Clavet as Mercier\n*[[Linlyn Lue]] as [[Manitou|She-Manitou]]\n*[[Zoe Hopkins]] as an Algonquin}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Bruce Beresford]] had wanted to make a film out of [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]]'s novel ever since it was first published. The rights had been acquired by Canada's [[Alliance Films]], which had signed another director. That person fell out, as did another director, before the job was given to Beresford.<ref name=\"urban\">Andrew Urban, \"Black Robe\", ''Cinema Papers'', March 1991 p6-12</ref> Beresford:\n<blockquote>I think that, even if you have no religious faith whatever or, even if you despised the Jesuits, you would still find it an interesting story. It's a wonderful study of obsession and love. And it is a wonderful adventure of the spirit and of the body. What those people did, going to a country where winters were far more severe than anything they had known in Europe, meeting people who were far more fierce than anyone they had ever encountered... Having to deal with these people shows us something of humanity at its greatest. It's the equivalent of today's people getting into space shuttles and going off into space. It takes unbelievable courage to do this.<ref name=\"signet\"/></blockquote>\nThe film remained in [[development hell]] for over four years due to no major American studio willing to finance the project. Beresford was only able to convince Alliance Films to hire him after his previous film, ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The success of ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', a film with similar themes released the prior year, also convinced Alliance of the project's viability.\n\nFunds were raised under a co-production treaty between Canada and Australia. The production needed 30% Australian financing, and the [[Film Finance Corporation]] investment had to be spent on Australian elements, such as an Australian crew and two Australian actors.<ref name=\"urban\" /><ref name=\"signet\">[http://petermalone.misacor.org.au/tiki-index.php?page=Bruce+Beresford \"Interview with Bruce Beresford\"], ''Signet'', 7 December 1991 accessed 13 June 2019</ref>\n\nThe film was shot primarily on-location in [[Quebec]], in the [[Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean]] region. Additional scenes were shot in [[Rouen]] in northern [[France]]. The entire film was shot in-sequence.\n\n==Release==\n''Black Robe'' opened in Canada on 4 October 1991 and then had a exclusive opening in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on 1 November 1991 before expanding on 22 November to a further 222 theaters.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2 December 1991|title='Robe' breaks out|page=78|last=Ayscough|first=Suzan}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Black Robe'' was praised as a \"magnificently staged combination of top talents delivering a gripping and tragic story\",<ref name=\"variety\"/> and has been rated one of the most meticulously researched representations of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] life put on film.<ref name=\"rotten\">{{cite web |last=Rotten Tomatoes |title=Black Robe (1991) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_robe/about.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629041503/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_robe/about.php |archive-date=29 June 2007}}</ref> Notably, the film includes dialogue in the [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], and [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] languages.
