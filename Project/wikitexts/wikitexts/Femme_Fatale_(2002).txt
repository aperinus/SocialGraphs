The diamonds are located on a gold ensemble worn by model Veronica, who is accompanying real-life director [[R\u00e9gis Wargnier]] to the premiere of his film ''[[East/West]]''. Laure seduces Veronica in order to obtain the diamonds, during which her accomplices \"Black Tie\" and Racine provide support. However, the heist is botched and Laure ends up double-crossing her accomplices and escaping to Paris with the diamonds. In Paris, a series of events causes Laure to be mistaken for a missing Parisian woman named Lily who had recently disappeared. While Laure luxuriates in a tub in Lily's home, the real Lily returns and commits suicide while Laure secretly watches, providing Laure the opportunity to take her identity for good, and she leaves the country for the United States.\n\nSeven years later, Laure (in her identity as \"Lily\") resurfaces in Paris as the wife of Bruce Watts, the new American ambassador to France. After arriving in France, a Spanish [[paparazzo]] named Nicolas Bardo takes her picture. The picture is displayed around Paris, and Black Tie (who has coincidentally been released from prison seven years after being arrested for the heist) spots Bardo's photo while in the middle of killing a woman, seen talking earlier with Laure at a caf\u00e9, by throwing her into the path of a speeding truck. With Laure exposed to her vengeful ex-accomplices, she decides to frame Bardo for her own (staged) kidnapping. Bardo is further manipulated by Laure into following through with the \"kidnapping\", and in the process, they begin a sexual relationship. The pair eventually meet with Bruce for a ransom exchange; however, Bardo has a crisis of conscience at the last moment and sabotages the scheme. In retaliation, Laure executes both Bruce and Bardo, only to be surprised by her ex-accomplices afterwards who promptly throw her off a bridge to her seeming death.\n\nIn an extended [[twist ending]], the entirety of the film's events after Laure enters the tub in Lily's home are revealed to be a dream. In reality, Laure spies Lily entering the home as before, but this time Laure stops Lily from committing suicide. Seven years later, Laure and Veronica, who is revealed to have been Laure's partner all along, chat about the success of their diamond caper. Black Tie and Racine arrive seeking revenge, but they are indirectly killed by the same truck that killed Veronica in Laure's dream. Bardo, witnessing all these events, introduces himself to Laure, swearing that he has met her before, with Laure replying \"Only in my dreams.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as Laure Ash / Lily Watts\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Nicolas Bardo\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Ambassador Bruce Hewitt Watts\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] as Black Tie\n* [[\u00c9douard Montoute]] as Racine\n* [[Rie Rasmussen]] as Veronica\n* [[Thierry Fr\u00e9mont]] as Inspector Serra\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Shiff\n* [[\u00c9va Darlan]] as Irma\n* Fiona Curzon as Stanfield Phillips\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed reviews during its theatrical release; however, it was praised by several high-profile critics, including [[Manohla Dargis]]  and [[Roger Ebert]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/femme-fatale/critic-reviews|title=Femme Fatale|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> who gave it a 4 star review and called it one of De Palma's best films.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/femme-fatale-2002 |title=Femme Fatale :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |access-date=16 April 2012 |date=6 November 2002}}</ref>  The film has a 49% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 136 reviews.\n\nAt the [[2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]], the film received nominations for Worst Director (De Palma) and Worst Actress (Romijn-Stamos, also for ''[[Rollerball (2002 film)|Rollerball]]'').
