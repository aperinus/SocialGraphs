The film stars [[Chris Farley]], [[Nicollette Sheridan]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], with [[Chris Rock]], and [[Robin Shou]]. The main plot revolves around Haru (portrayed by Farley), a white orphan boy who is found by a clan of [[ninja]]s as an infant in an abandoned treasure chest and is raised by them.\n\nHaru never quite conforms to their culture and never acquires the skills of a ninja, but is nonetheless good natured, and persevering in his personal ambitions. His first mission brings him to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] to investigate a murder mystery. It was the last film starring Farley to be released in his lifetime, as he died eleven months after its release.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-01-20/news/9701200087_1_beverly-hills-ninja-chris-farley-box-office | work=Chicago Tribune | title=\"Beverly Hills Ninja\" Tops Beverly Hills Cop | date=January 20, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA clan of [[ninjas]] in [[Japan]] finds an abandoned chest that has been washed onto shore with a white baby boy inside. One of their ancient legends spoke of a foreign white male who would come among them and become a master like no other would. Haru is raised amongst the ninja, with the expectation that he may become the legendary master. As Haru grows into adulthood, doubts are quickly cast over this, as he is clumsy and lacking his ninja skills, and so he fails to graduate as a ninja with the rest of his class. Left alone to protect the temple while the clan are on a mission, Haru disguises himself as a ninja when an American woman, Sally Jones, comes to the temple seeking assistance. She tells Haru that she is suspicious of her boyfriend, Martin Tanley, and asks him to investigate. Haru discovers that Tanley and his bodyguard, Nobu, are involved in a [[Counterfeit money|money counterfeiting]] business, but is unable to inform Sally before she leaves. Haru leaves Japan and later flies to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] in search of Sally. Haru's adoptive brother, Gobei, is sent by the clan's [[sensei]] to secretly watch over and protect him during his mission.\n\nHaru checks in at a Beverly Hills hotel, where he befriends its bellboy, Joey Washington, and teaches him some ninja lessons. Unaware that Gobei is helping him, Haru manages to find Sally. Haru tracks Tanley and Nobu to a night club in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]], where they are attempting to retrieve a set of counterfeiting plates from their rival gang. The gangs fight, resulting in the deaths of two of the rival gang members, for which Haru finds himself as being the prime suspect. Haru returns to the hotel room the next day, where he receives his guidance from his sensei. Haru resumes his search for Sally, and locates Tanley's mansion. Haru finds Sally and discovers that her real name is actually Alison Page. Alison informs him that Tanley murdered her sister, and that she is dating Tanley while using a fake name in order to get evidence. Haru discovers that Tanley will be hiring an ink specialist, Chet Walters, to help counterfeit money. Haru disguises himself as Walters and later infiltrates Tanley's warehouse. Haru's identity is exposed after failing to properly counterfeit the money and Tanley captures him. While Tanley succeeds in obtaining the other half of the plates from the rival gang, Alison rescues Haru, only to be kidnapped by Tanley herself. Haru enlists Joey's help in finding Tanley's warehouse to rescue Alison. Gobei intervenes without Haru's knowledge and leads them back to the warehouse.\n\nHaru tries to intervene, but is overwhelmed by guards. Gobei reveals himself to Haru, and manages to distract the guards, allowing Haru to rescue Alison. Haru uses a forklift to smash two holes of the room where Tanley locked up Alison with a bomb. Haru tries to defuse the bomb, but he accidentally resets it for five minutes. On hearing Gobei become overwhelmed by the guards, Haru goes to help him. Haru snaps and suddenly demonstrates amazing martial arts moves, stunning Gobei. Haru saves Gobei's life and successfully defeats several guards himself. Haru and Gobei are left facing off Nobu and two guards. Trying to enter the building, Joey crashes through a window and knocks himself and one of the guards unconscious. Haru and Gobei defeat Nobu and the remaining guard and later fights Tanley. In the fight that follows, Haru accidentally knocks Gobei unconscious by hitting him in the head with a sheave, but he manages to force Tanley to flee afterwards. Haru continues to rescue Alison, where he uses a large harpoon gun mounted on a cart and shoots it through the room and inadvertently lands in the back of a truck in which Tanley is trying to escape. The harpoon drags the bomb into Tanley's truck and explodes into flames. Haru successfully rescues Alison, while Tanley and his surviving hitmen are arrested by [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles police]].\n\nHaru tells his sensei that he will be living in Beverly Hills with Alison. As Haru and Alison leave together for Beverly Hills, a grappling hook tied to a rope has fallen from the bus and accidentally hooks into Gobei's wheelchair, causing him to be thrown into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Haru shouts an apology to Gobei at the end of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Haru\n** [[Jason Davis (actor, born 1984)|Jason Davis]] as Young Haru\n* [[Nicollette Sheridan]] as Sally Jones / Alison Page \n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Martin Tanley\n* [[Soon-Tek Oh]] as Sensei\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Joey Washington\n* [[Robin Shou]] as Gobei\n* [[Keith Cooke|Keith Cooke Hirabayashi]] as Nobu\n* [[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] as Chet Walters\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] as Izumo\n* [[Jason Tobin]] as Busboy\n* [[John P.
