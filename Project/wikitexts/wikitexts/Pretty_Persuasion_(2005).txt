Its plot follows a 15-year-old student at an elite [[Beverly Hills]] academy who accuses her drama teacher of [[sexual harassment]].\n\n==Plot==\nKimberly Joyce is a precocious, [[narcissistic]], [[psychopathy|sociopathic]] high school student at Roxbury Academy, an elite preparatory school in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. She and her best friend Brittany take Randa, a new [[Muslim]] student who recently emigrated from the [[Middle East]], under their wing. Kimberly's home life is troubled; her [[bigot]]ed and disaffected father Hank, an electronics executive, shows little interest in her life, while her vapid stepmother, Kathy, constantly attempts to reprimand her for her coarse language and attitude. Kimberly dreams of becoming an actress, and obtains a coveted role as [[Anne Frank]] in the school play.\n\nThe school drama teacher, Percy Anderson, orders Kimberly and Randa to after-school detention one day for disrupting class, and forces Kimberly to write an essay reflecting on her transgression. Percy takes the essay home that evening and has his wife, Grace, read it aloud provocatively as a [[Sexual roleplay|role play]] before the two engage in sex. After Brittany is publicly humiliated by Percy during an acting exercise, Kimberly devises a plan to accuse him of [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] each of them. Unable to afford an attorney, Percy agrees to his friend Roger - a clueless high school law teacher who passed the bar - acting as his attorney. In court, Roger proposes that the accusations are in retaliation to Kimberly having been replaced in the school play after referring to her Jewish classmate Josh's lawyer father as a \"money-grubbing [[shyster]].\"\n\nThe case becomes a media sensation covered extensively by Emily Klein, a local [[lesbian]] reporter. Shortly after the trial begins, Kimberly has a sexual encounter with Emily. She manipulates Josh with [[oral sex]] into convincing his father Larry, a renowned defense attorney, to defend Percy ''[[pro bono]]''. When Larry cross examines Brittany, she confesses on the stand that she, Kimberly, and Randa fabricated the accusations. When Emily confronts her outside the courthouse, Kimberly reveals she filmed their sexual encounter, and uses it as [[blackmail]] to receive favorable press coverage.\n\nOverwhelmed with the shame brought on her family by the false accusations, Randa shoots herself dead at school. Grace, now aware the essay Percy had her read was written by Kimberly, leaves him. In the storm of media coverage, Emily extolls Kimberly as a mere \"victim\" of society, and the ensuing press incites Hollywood producers to give Kimberly a [[bit part]] on a daytime [[soap opera]].\n\nWhen Brittany visits Kimberly at her house, Kimberly reveals she manipulated Josh into having his father defend Percy as she knew it would cause Brittany to buckle under pressure in court. When Brittany asks why, Kimberly explains that she devised the calculated plot to garner publicity for herself, as well as exact revenge against Brittany for having stolen her ex-boyfriend, Troy. Brittany lambasts her and leaves, vowing never to speak to her again. Kimberly turns on the television and sees herself on the episode of the soap opera. As she watches herself onscreen, tears begin streaming down her face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Kimberly Joyce\n* [[James Woods]] as Hank Joyce\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Percy Anderson\n* [[Elisabeth Harnois]] as Brittany\n* Adi Schnall as Randa\n* [[Stark Sands]] as Troy\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Emily Klein\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Headmaster Charles Meyer\n* [[Danny Comden]] as Roger Nicholl\n* [[Jaime King]] as Kathy Joyce\n* [[Josh Zuckerman]] as Josh Horowitz\n* [[James Snyder (actor)|James Snyder]] as David \"Dave\"\n* [[Cody McMains]] as Kenny\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Grace Anderson\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Judge Carl Munro\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Larry Horowitz\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Woman\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe plot primarily focuses on [[sexual harassment]] accusations within a school system, as well as the repercussions of one 15-year-old girl's actions.
