Lansdale]].  Hall plays a man who kills a burglar, whose father (Shepard) subsequently seeks revenge.  The plot is further complicated when a private investigator (Johnson) shows up.\n\nThe project had a long gestation, and production did not begin until seven years after Mickle read the novel.  Mickle and Damici had previously written about feminist themes in ''[[We Are What We Are (2013 film)|We Are What We Are]]'' (2013) and wanted to cover more masculine themes.  Filming took place over 25 days in the [[Hudson Valley]] area of [[New York (state)|New York]].  It premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].  [[IFC Films]] theatrically released the film in North America on May 23, 2014, where it grossed $427,418.  The film is \"Certified Fresh\" at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and has an approval rating of 85%. It was released on DVD on September 30, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nAnn Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard.  He accidentally shoots the intruder, identified as Freddy Russell, a wanted felon.  Richard is shaken by the experience.  Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Freddy's burial where Freddy's father, Ben\u2014a paroled convict\u2014accosts Richard in his car, making a veiled reference to Richard's son, Jordan.  Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and arranges for Ann to meet them at the police station.  Though Ben follows him to his son's school, the police decline Richard's request for help.  However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection.\n\nPolice are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns.  It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door. When Richard is alerted to Ben's presence inside the house by the sound of water dripping from the open crawlspace hatch, he alerts the observing police and breaks down Jordan's bedroom door.  Ben has already escaped out the window and to a nearby river, however, and is tracked to Mexico\u2014where he is apprehended.  The police invite Richard to the station to close the case, and, while there, Richard notices a wanted poster for \"Frederick Russell\", who looks different from the man he shot.  Richard repeatedly attempts to point out the contradiction to officer Ray Price, but Ray dismisses this as a trick of memory due to shock and refuses to discuss the issue.\n\nRichard sees Ben taken away in an unmarked police car, which he follows.  He sees the police forcibly remove Ben from the car, and inject him with an unknown substance, splash him with alcohol, and leave him on train tracks to die.  Richard saves Ben from an approaching train.  Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that the man he shot was not Freddy.  The two exhume Freddy's grave and Ben confirms that the body In the coffin is not his son.  Ben notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification.\n\nRay Price visits Richard at work and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is visited by Jim Bob Luke\u2014a  private investigator known by Ben\u2014who says the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar.  Jim theorizes that after Freddy became involved with the [[Dixie Mafia]], he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information.\n\nJim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in [[Houston]] under the name \"Frank Miller\".  When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be [[snuff film]]s, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat.  Richard wants to take the tape to the police.  Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss.  Ben is so enraged by his son's actions that he is resolved to kill him at any cost.\n\nThey track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film.  They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter.  When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot.  Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him.  Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, shoots his son in the head, and dies from his own wounds shortly after.  Jim and Richard set the mansion ablaze and escape with the hostage.  The next morning Richard returns home to his family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael C.

When he read through ''Cold in July'' in just a few hours, he excitedly realized that he had not seen these elements in a film before and looked to adapt it.<ref name=fearnet/>  Mickle said the film was difficult to pitch due to how it constantly evolves and re-invents itself.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/cannes-qa-cold-in-july-director-jim-mickle-1201183877/| title=Cannes Q&A: 'Cold in July' Director Jim Mickle| last=Debruge| first=Peter| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=May 16, 2014| access-date=May 31, 2014}}</ref>  In order to reassure financiers, Mickle described Korean thrillers that had succeeded with similar shifts in tone, but he says that he doubts that he convinced anyone.<ref name=aicn>{{cite web | url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/67477| title=Capone Talks Shifting Tones and '80s Mullets, With Cold In July director Jim Mickle!!!| last=Prokopy| first=Steve| work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]| date=May 28, 2014| access-date=May 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMickle stated that he had difficulty getting the film made\u2014it took seven years from when he first read the novel.  The first draft of the script, a verbatim copy of the novel, was 220 pages long; from there, Mickle and Damici edited the script down to a more manageable size.  The final script was also the furthest from the novel, but they felt it was closest in spirit.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-sundance-2014-cold-in-july-main-stage-20140118,0,5742103.story| title=Sundance 2014: 'Cold In July' Jumps Genre Onto Fest's Main Stage| last=Olsen| first=Mark| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=January 18, 2014| access-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref>  Lansdale said that he saw all the revisions of the script except for the last and \"felt respected through the entire process.\"<ref name=den>{{cite web | last=Buxton| first=Marc| title=Cold in July Author Joe R.

Eventually, they were able to edit it down by removing unnecessary dialog that could be replaced through body language.  Changing the time period was never considered, as Mickle considered the themes of masculinity and manhood to come from a previous era that would not work in a more modern setting.<ref name=fearnet/>  Shepard also contributed to the script.  Mickle and Damici had struggled with one particularly difficult scene and debated removing it entirely.  When Shepard offered to rewrite it, Mickle gratefully accepted.  Shepard returned with a single typewritten page and offered to run it by Damici, but Mickle said it was not necessary and accepted it as-is.<ref name=paste/>\n\nMickle and Damici were drawn to Lansdale's cross-genre style, as their own films were also cross-genre.  Although primarily known for their work in horror films, Damici and Mickle said that they were more interested in storytelling and making good films, and Damici said that they can return to making horror films at any time.<ref name=latimes/>  Mickle used Hall's character to ground the film so that audiences would not feel lost as the film crossed genres.  Mickle wanted to avoid obvious genre categorization and predictability, as he felt that genre films needed to be shaken up.  Buyers had previously encouraged him to re-cut one of his films so that audiences could easily identify the genre, limited to six subgenres, in the first ten minutes.  Mickle said their advice \"blew [his] mind\".<ref name=fearnet/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn September 2013, Sam Shepard, Don Johnson, and Vinessa Shaw joined Michael C. Hall, who had already been cast.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/shepard-johnson-shaw-join-cold-in-july-exclusive-1200597423/| title=Shepard, Johnson, Shaw Join 'Cold in July' (Exclusive)| last=Hopewell| first=John| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=September 3, 2013| access-date=February 3, 2014}}</ref>  Because he played a killer on ''Dexter'', Hall said that the script quieted any concerns he had about being typecast.  ''Cold in July'' was filmed after ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' ended, and Hall was drawn to the role based on his desire to play a more normal character; Hall called the role therapeutic, as it allowed him to move on from playing the iconic serial killer [[Dexter Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/michael-c-hall-moves-on-from-dexter-with-a-new-killer-role| title=Michael C.
