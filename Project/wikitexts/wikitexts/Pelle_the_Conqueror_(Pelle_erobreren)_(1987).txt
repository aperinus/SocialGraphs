The film tells the story of two Swedish immigrants to Denmark, a father and son, who try to build a new life for themselves. It stars [[Pelle Hvenegaard]] as the young Pelle, with [[Max von Sydow]] as his father, and also features [[Axel Str\u00f8bye]] and [[Astrid Villaume]].\n\nA co-production of Denmark and Sweden, August chose to adapt ''Boyhood'', the first part of Nex\u00f8's novel, seeking to make an epic and citing the novel's status as essential reading in Denmark. Pelle Hvenegaard was 11 when he was cast, after some 3,000 children auditioned. Like many other boys in Denmark, he was named by his family for the novel's eponymous character.\n\nThe film screened at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]] and [[New York Film Festival]]. It was critically acclaimed, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] and the 1988 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and numerous other honours.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 1850s, the elderly emigrant Lasse Karlsson and his son Pelle reach the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] after having left [[Sk\u00e5ne County]], in southern Sweden, following the death of the boy's mother. Lasse finds it difficult to find work, given his advanced age and Pelle's youth. They are forced to work at a large farm, where they are generally mistreated by the managers.\n\nThe managers work under the tyrannical Kongstrup, who has a history of affairs with women employees, and resulting illegitimate children. Among such children is Rud, who befriends Pelle and helps him learn [[Danish language|Danish]]. Eventually, Pelle becomes more confident, and begins going to school, though he is still [[Ethnic discrimination|discriminated]] against as a foreigner. Pelle also befriends the Swedish worker Erik, who is constantly harassed for alleged sloth. Erik shares his dream of visiting America, China and \"[[Negroland]]\" with Pelle, to \"conquer\" the world. Rud runs away after poor performance at school, but Pelle begins to do well.\n\nAfter Kongstrup impregnates Mrs. Kongstrup's visiting niece Miss Sine, his wife castrates him for his abuses. Lasse begins an affair with Mrs. Olsen, believed to be a widow since her husband has not returned from a long sea voyage. Pelle is teased at school for his father's affair.\n\nAt the farm, Erik is injured and disabled after attempting to lead a revolt against management. Mrs. Olsen's husband returns from his voyage, and Lasse is overcome with depression and alcoholism. The two appeal to the Kongstrups for aid against their harassment. Mrs. Kongstrup offers support, but her husband is silent. Pelle receives a promotion but, after seeing Erik forced from the farm, vows to leave. Lasse at first resolves to go with him, before deciding he is too old to travel. He sends Pelle alone into the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Max von Sydow]] as Lassefar \"Lasse\" Karlsson\n* [[Pelle Hvenegaard]] as Pelle Karlsson\n* [[Erik Paaske]] as Foreman\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Granath]] as Erik\n* [[Astrid Villaume]] as Mrs. Kongstrup\n* [[Axel Str\u00f8bye]] as Kongstrup\n* Troels Asmussen as Rud\n* Kristina T\u00f6rnqvist as Anna\n* Karen Wegener as Mrs. Olsen\n* [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]] as Miss Sine\n* [[Lars Simonsen]] as Niels K\u00f8ller\n* [[Buster Larsen]] as Ole K\u00f8ller\n* [[John Wittig]] as Schoolteacher\n* [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Nilen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Bille August.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bille August]] co-adapted and directed ''Pelle the Conqueror'' out of an ambition to make an [[epic film]].]]\nThe film, based on the 1910 novel of the [[Pelle the Conqueror (novel)|same name]] by [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], was a [[Co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] by Danish and Swedish companies.
