Both are fictionalized retellings of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. The film was co-written and directed by [[Zack Snyder]], while Miller served as [[executive producer]] and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a [[superimposition]] [[chroma key]] technique to replicate the imagery of the original comic book.\n\nThe plot revolves around [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] ([[Gerard Butler]]), who leads 300 [[Sparta]]ns into battle against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Sacred king|\"God-King\"]] [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] ([[Lena Headey]]) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a [[voice-over]] narrative by the Spartan soldier [[Aristodemus (Spartan)|Dilios]] ([[David Wenham]]). Through this [[unreliable narrator|narrative technique]], various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing ''300'' within the genre of [[historical fantasy]].\n\n''300'' premiered at the Austin [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] on December 9, 2006, and was released at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 14, 2007, before being released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] 8 in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] Disc, and [[HD DVD]] on July 31, 2007. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising its visuals and style but criticizing its depiction of the [[Persians]], which some characterized as bigoted or [[anti-Iranian sentiment|Iranophobic]]. Grossing over $456 million, the film's opening was the 24th-largest in [[box office]] history at the time. A [[sequel]], titled ''[[300: Rise of an Empire|Rise of an Empire]]'', based on Miller's previously unpublished [[graphic novel]] [[prequel]] ''Xerxes'', was released on March 7, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 479 B.C., one year after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Dilios, a [[hoplite]] in the [[Spartan army]], begins his story by depicting the life of [[Leonidas I]] from childhood to kingship via [[Agoge|Spartan doctrine]]. Dilios's story continues and a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] herald arrives at the gates of [[Sparta]] demanding \"[[earth and water]]\" as a token of submission to [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]]\u2014the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort down into a bottomless pit. Leonidas then visits the [[Ephor]]s, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the [[Thermopylae|Hot Gates]]. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians [[Choke point|into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea]]: negating the Persian advantage in numbers, and giving the Greeks' [[heavy infantry]] the advantage over the vast waves of Persian [[light infantry]]. The Ephors consult the Oracle, who decrees that Sparta may not go to war during the [[Carneia]]. As Leonidas angrily departs, an agent from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support.\n\nAlthough the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal [[bodyguard]]. They are joined along the way by a force composed of a few thousand [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]ns and other Greeks. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall, using slain Persian scouts as [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders an enraged Persian emissary to return to his lines and warn Xerxes, after cutting off his whipping arm.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonidas encounters [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Birth and death|infanticide]]. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the [[phalanx]] formation.\n\nThe battle begins soon after the Spartans' [[Molon labe|refusal to lay down their weapons]]. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas and offers him wealth and power in exchange for his submission. Leonidas declines and mocks the inferior quality of Xerxes' fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the [[Immortals (Achaemenid Empire)|Immortals]]; the Spartans nonetheless defeat them with few losses, with slight help from the Arcadians.\n\nOn the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states, including [[war elephant]]s, to crush the Spartans, but to no avail. Meanwhile, an embittered Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened: a \"tale of victory\".\n\nIn Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] tries to persuade the [[Gerousia|Spartan Council]] to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he \"owns\" the council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes' gold. Acknowledging his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes' [[General officer|general]] again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. Angered, Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas throws his spear at Xerxes, which cuts across and wounds his face, proving the [[Sacred king|God-King]]'s mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.\n\nDilios, now back in Sparta, concludes his tale before the council. Inspired by Leonidas' sacrifice, the Greeks mobilize. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300, Dilios, now head of the Spartan Army, leads them to battle against the Persians across the fields of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

During the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Xerxes's invasion of Greece coincided with a Spartan religious festival, the [[Carneia]], in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war. Still, realizing the threat of the Persians and not wanting to appear as Persian sympathizers, the Spartan government, rather than Leonidas alone, decided to send Leonidas with his personal 300-strong bodyguard to Thermopylae.<ref>Herodotus 7.206.</ref> Other Greek ''poleis'' joined the 300 Spartan men and totaled somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 total Greek troops.
