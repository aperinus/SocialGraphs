This TV miniseries also shares the name with a [[1956 in film|1956]] [[Helen of Troy (film)|film]] starring [[Stanley Baker]]. It stars [[Sienna Guillory]] as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Matthew Marsden]] as [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], [[Rufus Sewell]] as [[Agamemnon]], [[James Callis]] as [[Menelaus]], [[John Rhys-Davies]] as [[Priam]], [[Maryam d'Abo]] as [[Hecuba]], as well as [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Theseus]]. The series was entirely shot on location in the islands of [[Malta]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2017}}\nIt begins with the birth of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], as well as [[Cassandra]]'s prophecy that he would be the cause of [[Troy]]'s destruction. Worried, his father, King [[Priam]], leaves him on [[Mount Ida]], where he is found and raised by the shepherd [[Agelaus]]. When he is an adult, Paris goes off on a friendly fight with some other shepherds. One of them  tells him about his goat named Stubos that got away again and he chases it to a cave where the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]] appear and ask him to judge which of them is the most beautiful. To bribe him, Hera offered him power while Athena offers him victory yet he chooses Aphrodite, who promises him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Sparta]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] sees Paris's judgement in a pool of water and happily accepts his choice of her love. She later meets the Mycenaean King, [[Agamemnon]], who has come to claim her sister, [[Clytemnestra]], as his bride, but is also immediately taken by Helen's attractiveness. During the wedding feast, after she noticed that everyone seems to be staring at her including Agamemnon and [[Menelaus]], his brother, she is kidnapped by two Athenians. Helen learns the truth of her mother's death from [[Theseus]], one of the men who kidnapped her, then they took her to [[Athens]], where she falls for him, before her brother [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]] raids Athens and kills him in order to save her. As he is dying, Theseus stabs Pollux. In Sparta, Helen's father [[Tyndareus]] rages at his daughter, blaming her for losing his heir. He presents her to the many suitors who seek her hand, bidding them to do as they wish.\n\nThe suitors draw lots after swearing an oath suggested by clever [[Odysseus]] that if anyone disrespect her husband's claims to her, they should unite and wage war against him. Odysseus rules himself and Agamemnon out of the lot, since they are both married. They agree to the oath and Agamemnon's brother Menelaus wins. Agamemnon is visibly jealous.\n\nMeanwhile, Paris' favorite bull is taken for the Trojan tribute games. Paris insists on competing, despite his father's protests. After winning in every competition and being recognized by his sister Cassandra, Paris is welcomed by an overjoyed Priam to Troy. Cassandra, a seer, as well as his elder brother [[Hector]] are upset at their father's decision.\n\nParis is sent to [[Sparta]] to draw out a peace treaty with Sparta and Menelaus alone, which angers Agamemnon. His treaty is refused and both Menelaus and Agamemnon plot to have him murdered. While there, however, he encounters and recognizes Helen, while Menelaus is showing off his new bride by having her walk naked through one of his feasts.  Paris later prevents her from committing suicide. He then gains her love and she helps him flee. Together they sail to Troy.\n\nWhen Menelaus finds out, he demands that his brother launch war on Troy and the former suitors are gathered to fulfill their oath. But the winds are not in their favor and after a month, it is revealed that the goddess [[Artemis]] wants Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter in return for favorable winds. He carries out the deed, despite a heavy heart.\n\nHelen and Paris arrive at Troy with the Greek army at their heels. The Greeks send an embassy of Menelaus and Odysseus to demand Helen's return. Priam is at first reluctant to allow Helen to remain at Troy until he talks to her alone where she admits her love for Paris. Priam refuses, thus the Greeks plan an attack.\n\nIn the morning, the battle is joined on the beach of Troy, with Hector nearly killed by Agamemnon. The battle ends with the Trojan army's crushing defeat and the Greeks camping on the beach.\n\nTen years pass. Agamemnon agrees to end the war with a single combat, between Menelaus and Paris. If Menelaus wins, Helen will be returned. If Menelaus loses, the Trojans may keep her. Whatever the outcome, the Greeks have to leave Troy.\n\nAgamemnon cheats by poisoning Menelaus' javelin without telling him. During the duel Paris is cut and the poison disorients him. Menelaus, however, does not take advantage; instead, they stop fighting and make peace between each other as a fog obscures them from view.\n\nAs the fog lifts, Agamemnon's cheating is exposed. Hector challenges Agamemnon to a duel to the death that will end the war. [[Achilles]] takes up the challenge, fighting for Agamemnon, but agrees to fight not for Helen but for his own honor. Achilles easily kills Hector.\n\nThat night Helen, fearing for Paris's safety, goes to Cassandra and asks what she can do to protect Paris. Cassandra replies that her only choice is to give herself to the Greeks. Helen agrees, presenting herself in Agamemnon's tent and offering a trade\u2014her for the body of Hector. Agamemnon refuses, as he does not want his daughter's death to be in vain, as well as chases her around the camp, but Paris arrives in time to save her, challenging Agamemnon for the safety of Troy. Achilles charges at him, but Paris seizes a bow and shoots Achilles in the heel, killing him. Afterwards the Greeks attack him, but he is saved by Trojan soldiers and is reunited with Helen. Shortly thereafter, Agamemnon finds and stabs Paris. He dies in Helen's arms.\n\nDuring Paris' funeral, the Greeks are reported to have sailed away\u2014leaving a Trojan Horse, a massive wooden horse, on the shore. It is taken into the city and Troy celebrates late into the night. Unbeknownst to them though, there are some Greek soldiers inside the wooden horse. When they are all asleep, the Greeks come out and sack the city, slaying Priam and [[Hecuba]]. Agamemnon seats himself proudly on Troy's throne as the new emperor of the Aegean and ruler of the World. Agamemnon has his men bring Helen to his throne. Agamemnon strokes Helen's hair, restrains her and then begins to rape her. Menelaus tries to stop him, but is held back by Agamemnon's guards. Odysseus is also shocked at Agamemnon's act, but can do nothing.\n\nThe next morning, as the Greek soldiers ravage the ruins of Troy of its riches and take its people as slaves, Clytemnestra arrives in the royal palace, where she ventures into the royal pool. There, she finds Agamemnon and Helen, both naked. Agamemnon relaxes in triumph, while Helen sits near the pool, not saying a word. Clytemnestra covers her sister with a robe and sends her away, leaving her alone with Agamemnon. She tells him she came for their daughter, [[Iphigenia]]. Agamemnon replies that she is not here. Clytemnestra replies \"I know\" then attacks, throwing her net-like shawl over her husband and stabs him repeatedly to death in the pool.\n\nHelen wanders woefully through the ruined city, halting at the spot where Paris was slain. There, she sees an apparition of Paris and they embrace. Helen begs Paris to take her with him to the afterlife and he tells her that he has prepared a place for her, but she must wait; until it is her time. He disappears and Menelaus arrives and draws his sword out. Helen prepares for her punishment, but Menelaus puts his sword away and can do nothing but feel sorry for her. Helen tells him she cannot love him, but she \"will follow\". The two head back to the Greek ships, ready to live the rest of their lives as king and queen of Sparta, leaving Troy, a kingdom that was once the richest of all, in ruins.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Sienna Guillory]]  as [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]\n*[[Matthew Marsden]]  as [[Paris of Troy|Paris]]\n*[[Rufus Sewell]]  as [[Agamemnon]]\n*[[John Rhys-Davies]]  as [[Priam|King Priam]] of Troy\n*[[Maryam d'Abo]]  as Queen [[Hecuba]]\n*[[Emilia Fox]]  as [[Cassandra]], Princess of Troy\n*[[James Callis]]  as [[Menelaus]]\n*[[Daniel Lapaine]]  as [[Hector of Troy|Hector]]\n*[[Nigel Whitmey]]  as [[Odysseus]]\n*[[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]]  as [[Theseus]]\n*Joe Montana  as [[Achilles]]\n*Katie Blake as [[Clytemnestra]]\n*[[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]]  as Pollux\n*Kristina Paris  as [[Iphigenia]]\n*[[Mat Fraser (actor)|Mat Fraser]] as [[Calchas]], seer of Artemis\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0340477|title=Helen of Troy}}\n*{{Amg movie|285560|Helen of Troy}}\n\n{{USANetwork Shows}}\n{{Iliad navbox}}\n{{John Kent Harrison}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Helen of Troy}}\n[[Category:2003 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2003 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 television films]]\n[[Category:2000s American television miniseries]]\n[[Category:Agamemnon]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Helen of Troy]]\n[[Category:Films based on the Iliad]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Kent Harrison]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joel Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films set in ancient Greece]]\n[[Category:Television series based on classical mythology]]\n[[Category:Television shows based on the Iliad]]\n[[Category:Trojan War films]]"}]}}}}
