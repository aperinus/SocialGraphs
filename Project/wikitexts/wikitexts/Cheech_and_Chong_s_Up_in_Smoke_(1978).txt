It is [[Cheech & Chong]]'s first feature-length film.\n\nCheech & Chong had been a [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedy team for about ten years before they started reworking some of their material for their first film. Most of the film was shot in [[Los Angeles, California]], including scenes set in [[Tijuana]], while scenes set on the Mexican border were actually filmed at the border in [[Yuma, Arizona]].\n\nWhile negatively received upon its release, ''Up in Smoke'' grossed over $104 million, is credited with establishing the [[stoner film]] genre, and is now considered a [[Cult following|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnthony \"Man\" Stoner, an unemployed, [[Cannabis smoking|marijuana-smoking]] drummer, is told to either get a job by sundown or be sent off to military school by his parents. Man leaves the house and later becomes stranded on the highway. Man is picked up while hitchhiking by the equally enthusiastic stoner Pedro de Pacas, and the two share a large [[Joint (marijuana)|joint]], which is revealed to contain [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] feces after the dog ate Man's supply. When Pedro was having trouble breathing, Man accidentally gives him an extremely powerful dose of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. The police find their car parked on a traffic median with them in it, discover that they are high and arrest them. At trial, the pair are released on a technicality after Man discovers that the judge is drinking [[vodka]].\n\nIn an attempt to procure more [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], they visit Pedro's cousin Strawberry, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran. During the party, a lady snorts a couple of lines of [[Ajax (cleaning product)|Ajax]] set up by Man, under the presumption it was [[cocaine]], despite Man trying to warn her. They narrowly escape a police raid on Strawberry's house while Strawberry has a flashback and thinks the police are the [[Viet Cong]], but are soon deported to Tijuana, by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], along with Pedro's relatives, who actually called the INS on themselves, so they could get a free ride to a wedding in [[Tijuana]].\n\nIn order to get back to the [[United States]], they arrange to pick up a vehicle from Pedro's uncle's upholstery shop, but arrive at the wrong address: a marijuana processing plant disguised as an upholstery shop. They end up unknowingly involved in a plot to smuggle a van constructed completely out of \"fiberweed\" (hardened THC resin derived from marijuana - a play on the word [[fiberglass]]) from [[Mexico]] to [[Los Angeles]], with an inept police narcotics unit led by the insane and anti-drug Sgt. Stedenko hot on their trail. At the Mexican\u2013American border, they almost get arrested but attention is diverted to a group of nuns (into whose car Man had thrown his joint unintentionally to avoid getting arrested). The duo then cross the border into America as Stedenko finds out from his unit that they have apprehended the wrong group. Stendenko realizes that Pedro and Man\u2019s van is their target, and begin a pursuit; however, one of Stedenko's men accidentally shoots out one of their own tires, abruptly ending the chase.\n\nPedro and Man pick up two hitchhiking women who convince them to perform at a [[Battle of the Bands]] contest at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]]. After narrowly avoiding arrest by a motorcycle cop who had gotten high off fumes from the \u201cfiberweed\u201d van, they arrive at the venue to find that most of the bands performing are being negatively received by the audience, which causes Man to freak out. One of the women gives Man what she believes is an \"[[Stimulant|upper]]\", but mistakenly gives him the wrong drugs. The duo's band, Alice Bowie, win over the audience, including the cops, who get stoned due to a large amount of marijuana smoke from the burning van being funneled into the venue. The pair win the contest and a recording contract.\n\nThe film concludes with Pedro and Man driving in the former's car and dreaming how their future career will pay off. Man then lights a small portion of [[Hashish|hash]] and gives some to Pedro. However, it falls into his lap, causing him to panic and swerve the car while trying to put it out; Man attempts to put the hash out with his beer. During the scuffle, the car swerves down the road and smoke billows out the windows.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Pedro De Pacas\n* [[Tommy Chong]] as Anthony \"Man\" Stoner<ref>Chong's character name is used only once.
