It was first shown on 7 April 1933 and was subsequently banned in France until November 1945.<ref name=\"temple145\">Temple (2011), p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe film draws extensively on Vigo's boarding school experiences to depict a repressive and bureaucratised educational establishment in which surreal acts of rebellion occur, reflecting  Vigo's [[anarchist]] view of [[childhood]]. The title refers to a mark the boys would get which prevented them from going out on Sundays.\n\nThough the film was not an immediate success with audiences, it has proven to be enduringly influential. [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] paid homage to ''Zero for Conduct'' in his film ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). The anarchic classroom and recess scenes in Truffaut's film borrow from Vigo's film, as does a classic scene in which a mischievous group of schoolboys are led through the streets by one of their schoolmasters. Director [[Lindsay Anderson]] has acknowledged that his own film ''[[if....]]'' was inspired by ''Zero for Conduct''.\n\n==Plot==\nFour rebellious young boys at a repressive French boarding school plot and execute a revolt against their teachers and take over the school.<ref name=\"wakeman1139\">Wakeman (1987), p. 1139.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* G\u00e9rard de B\u00e9darieux \u2013 Tabard\n* Louis Lefebvre \u2013 Caussat\n* [[Gilbert Pruchon]] \u2013 Colin\n* Coco Golstein \u2013 Bruel\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] \u2013 Surveillant Huguet\n* Robert le Flon \u2013 Surveillant P\u00e8te-Sec\n* Du Verron \u2013 Surveillant-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bec-de-Gaz (as du Verron)\n* Delphin \u2013 Principal du Coll\u00e8ge\n* [[L\u00e9on Larive]] \u2013 Professeur (as Larive)\n* Madame \u00c9mile \u2013 M\u00e8re Haricot (as Mme.

He then met and befriended Jacques-Louis Nounez, a rich businessman who was interested in making films. Vigo discussed the idea of a film about his childhood experiences at a [[Millau]] boarding school and Nounez agreed to finance it.<ref name=\"wakeman1139\"/>\n\n''Zero for Conduct'' was shot from December 1932 until January 1933 with a budget of 200,000 francs. Vigo used mostly non-professional actors and sometimes people that he found on the street. The four main characters are all based on real people that Vigo had known in his youth. Caussat and Bruel were based on friends from Millau, Colin was based on a friend he had known in Chartes and Tabard was based on Vigo himself. The teachers depicted in the film were based on the guards at [[La Roquette Prisons|''La Petite Roquette'']] juvenile prison where Vigo's father [[Miguel Almereyda]] had once been an inmate. The film's soundtrack was of poor quality due to budgetary constraints but Vigo's use of poetic, rhythmic dialogue has been said to make it much easier to understand what characters are saying.<ref name=\"wakeman1139\"/> At one point in the film, Tabard tells his teachers \"shit on you!\", which was once a famous headline in a French newspaper that Vigo's father had directed at all world governments. Vigo's poor health became worse during the film's production but he was able to complete the editing.<ref name=\"wakeman1140\">Wakeman (1987), p. 1140.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was first screened on April 7, 1933 in Paris. The premiere shocked many audience members who hissed and booed Vigo. Other audience members, most notably [[Jacques Prevert]], loudly clapped.<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/>\n\nFrench film critics were strongly divided about the film. Some called it \"simply ridiculous\" and compared it to \"lavatory flushing\" while others praised its \"fiery daring\" and called Vigo \"the [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]] of the cinema.\"<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/> The film's most vocal critics included a French Catholic journal which called it a scatological work by \"an obsessed maniac.\" ''Zero for Conduct'' was quickly banned in France, with some believing that the French Ministry of the Interior considered it a threat capable of \"creating disturbances and hindering the maintenance of order.\"<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/>\n\n===Rediscovery===\nLike all of Vigo's work, ''Zero for Conduct'' first began to be rediscovered in about 1945 when a revival screening of his films was organized. Since then, its reputation has grown and it has influenced such films as [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959) and [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s ''[[if....]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/> Truffaut praised the film and said that \"in one sense ''Zero de Conduite'' represents something more rare than ''[[L'Atalante]]'' because the masterpieces consecrated to childhood in literature or cinema can be counted on the fingers of one hand. They move us doubly since the esthetic emotion is compounded by a biographical, personal and intimate emotion ... They bring us back to our short pants, to school, to the blackboard, to vacations, to our beginnings in life.\"<ref>Insdorf (1978), p. 145.</ref>\n\n==Style and themes==\nVigo's biographer Paulo Em\u00edlio Salles Gomes has discussed Vigo's \"extreme sensitivity to anything concerning a child's vulnerability in the adult world\" and his \"respect for children and their feelings.\"<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/>\n\nGomes also compared the boarding school in the film to a microcosm of the world, stating that \"the division to the children and adults inside the school corresponds to the division of society into classes outside: a strong minority imposing its will on a weak majority.\"<ref name=\"wakeman1140\"/>\n\n==Awards==\nThe 2011 [[Parajanov-Vartanov Institute]] Award posthumously honored Jean Vigo's ''Zero for Conduct''<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/son-of-anarchy-father-of-a-critic-a-tribute-to-jean-vigo-at-ucla-2169915 |title=Son of Anarchy, Father of a Critic: A Tribute to Jean Vigo at UCLA |author=Nicholas Rapold |date=7 April 2011 |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]]}}</ref> and was presented to his daughter and French film critic [[Luce Vigo]] by the actor [[Jon Voight]].<ref name=PVI>{{cite web |url=https://parajanov.com/awards/ |title=Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Awards |publisher=Parajanov-Vartanov Institute}}</ref> [[Martin Scorsese]] wrote a letter for the occasion, with praise for Vigo, [[Sergei Parajanov]] and [[Mikhail Vartanov]], all of whom struggled with heavy censorship.<ref name=PVI/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{citation |title=Z\u00e9ro de Conduite|journal=L'Avant-Sc\u00e8ne du Cin\u00e9ma|number=21|year=1962|pages=1\u201328}} (includes complete script)\n* {{cite book|last=Gomes |first=P.
