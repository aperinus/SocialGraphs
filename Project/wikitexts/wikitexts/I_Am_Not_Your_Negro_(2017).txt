Narrated by actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]], the film explores the history of [[racism in the United States]] through Baldwin's recollections of civil rights leaders [[Medgar Evers]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], as well as his personal observations of [[American history]].<ref>Young, Deborah (September 20, 2016). [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/i-am-not-your-negro-931087 \"\u2018I Am Not Your Negro\u2019: Film Review | TIFF 2016\"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.</ref> It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]] and won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Documentary]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU-QT8ewQYM \"O.J.: Made in America\" wins Best Documentary Feature-Oscars on YouTube]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oscars.org/news/15-documentary-features-advance-2016-oscar-race|title=15 Documentary Feature advance in 2016 Oscar Race|date=December 6, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017|publisher=Oscars.org}}</ref> The film was internationally co-financed between Germany and the United States.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prologue===\nThe film opens with a 1968 interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. [[Dick Cavett|Cavett]] notes that Baldwin is often asked a stubborn question: \"Why aren't the Negroes optimistic?\" He says that many people believe the situation to be improving considerably, with Black people now holding positions of influence across society: as mayors, professional athletes, politicians and TV actors. Cavett asks Baldwin, \"Is it at once getting much better and still hopeless?\"<ref>[https://www.tvo.org/transcript/131095X/i-am-not-your-negro Transcript: I Am Not Your Negro | Jun 27, 2020|TVO.or]</ref>\n\nIn response, Baldwin says, \"I don't think there's much hope for it, as long as people are using this peculiar language. It's not a question of what happens to the Negro here, [though] that is a very vivid question for me. The real question is what's going to happen to this country? I have to repeat that.\" Baldwin continues to assert throughout the film that the fate of [[United States|the United States]] is directly linked to how effectively it addresses the plight of [[African Americans|Black Americans]]. The prospects for the entire country and the prospects for Black Americans are inextricably tied together such that the truth and reckoning for one becomes the same for the other.\n\nThe film is divided into five chapters across which Baldwin weaves the assassinations of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and MLK Jr.. \n\n===Chapters===\nThe first chapter, \"Paying My Dues,\" portrays the [[School integration in the United States|school integration era]] of the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Massive resistance|fierce resistance]] to it [[White backlash|displayed by many white Americans]] in an attempt to maintain [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and the status quo of [[white supremacy]].\n\nThe second chapter, \"Heroes,\" highlights how white film protagonists are near-universally portrayed through a romantic, heroic lens when pursuing and protecting their interests, even and especially through the use of violence and rape. This is contrasted with the [[African-American representation in Hollywood|media portrayal of Black Americans]] who do not even need to be pursuing their interests to be suspected of crimes or deviant behavior and to [[Lynching in the United States|face the barbaric consequences]] of those unfounded suspicions.\n\nIn May 1963, Baldwin [[Baldwin\u2013Kennedy meeting|calls a meeting]] with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. With playwright [[Lorraine Hansberry]] in attendance, the meeting devolves into a tense standoff and does not conclude amicably. It does, however, contribute to Kennedy's awakening to the significance and urgency of racial issues across the country.\n\nThe third chapter, \"Purity,\" discusses many of the [[Racial hierarchy|socially constructed dividing lines]] which have separated black and white America, as well as the imbalance in expectations for [[deference]], [[One-drop rule|racial purity]], [[social capital]], [[Racial inequality in the United States#Racial wealth gap|spending power]], the achievement ceiling, and so on.\n\nIn 1965, at a Cambridge University debate with [[Conservatism|conservative]] commentator [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], Baldwin expounds on a recent remark from ex-AG Kennedy: \"It's conceivable that in 40 years in America, we might have a Negro [[President of the United States|president]].\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wT3s78LMHk James Baldwin on a black US President (1965)]</ref> He makes clear the absurdity and bitterness with which many Black Americans received the remark: \"Black people have been here all along, for the entire 400 years since [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] began. They were [[Atlantic slave trade|kidnapped, brought to America against their will]], and subjugated into subhuman, slave-laborer conditions. And yet they must wait 40 ''more'' years to even have a remote chance of being permitted into the highest office in the land?\"\n\nThe fourth chapter, \"Selling the Negro,\" tracks the history of exploitation of Black people, from an [[Slavery in the United States|economy of forced labor]] at the outset to an [[Prison\u2013industrial complex|economy of imprisonment]] today. A perennial tension in American life is emphasized, brought about by the historic and continued oppression of Black Americans versus an unyielding effort among many white Americans to convince themselves that any racial problem that may have existed in the past has since been resolved.\n\nThe fifth and final chapter, \"I Am Not A Nigger,\" elucidates the modern-day condition of Black America by tying the strands of the previous four chapters together. In the closing scene, Baldwin asserts that \"I can't be a pessimist because I'm alive, so I'm forced to be an optimist. But the future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country. It is entirely up to the American people whether or not they are going to face and deal with and embrace this stranger whom they maligned so long. What white people have to do is try to find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a '[[nigger]]' in the first place. Because I am not a nigger, I am a man! But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need him. And the question the white population of this country has got to ask itself\u2014[[Northern United States|North]] ''and'' [[Southern United States|South]], because it's one country, and for a Negro there is no difference between the North and the South. It's just a difference in the ''way'' they castrate you, but the fact of the castration is the American fact\u2014If I am not the nigger here, and you the white people invented him, then you've got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that, whether or not it's able to ask [itself] that question.\"\n\n==Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Leander Perez]] as himself\n* [[Dorothy Counts]] as herself\n* [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]''\n* [[Doris Day]]\n* [[Stepin Fetchit]]\n* [[Willie Best]]\n* [[Mantan Moreland]]\n* [[Clinton Rosemond]]\n* [[J.
