While [[Magic in fiction|magic]] is real, its practice is illegal. Rare magical artifacts known as [[magic wand]]s exist, but only a select few individuals called \"Brights\" can wield them without dying.\n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], veteran [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer Daryl Ward has been involuntarily partnered with Nick Jakoby, the nation's first orc police officer. Jakoby is equally detested by the other officers for his race and his fellow orcs for being a policeman. Ward's relationship with Jakoby is strained since Ward was shot by an orc robber Jakoby failed to apprehend; [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] suspects Jakoby deliberately let him go.\n\nOne night, Ward and Jakoby respond to a disturbance at a [[safe house]] for the \"Shield of Light\", an extremist group that prophesies the return of the \"[[Dark Lord]]\", an ancient semi-mythical figure defeated many millennia ago. Inside, Ward and Jakoby apprehend the lone survivor, an elf girl named Tikka in possession of a wand. Ward calls for backup, but the moment the four arriving officers see the wand, they try to coerce Ward into killing Jakoby and letting them steal the wand for themselves.\n\nWard goes outside, demanding the truth about the robber. Jakoby admits he lost sight of Ward's assailant and mistakenly apprehended a second, younger orc; he then helped him flee, knowing that the backup officers would probably kill the boy on sight. When the four officers appear behind Ward, planning to kill both him and Jakoby, Ward turns and guns them down. The gunfire attracts the attention of the local Hispanic gang, while rumors of the wand draw the attentions of both its owner Leilah, the leader of the radical elf sect the Inferni, and Kandomere, an elf [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent assigned to the federal \"Magic Task Force\".\n\nThe gangsters corner the trio in a strip club, but are slaughtered by Leilah, allowing the trio to escape again. At a service station, Ward contacts his friend, [[Los Angeles County Sheriff|Sheriff]] Deputy Rodriguez, whom he trusts. Rodriguez contacts Kandomere, but Leilah intercepts their conversation, attacks the service station and kills him.\n\nEscaping again, the trio is captured by the Fogteeth Orcs, whose leader Dorghu also wants the wand. He orders his son Mikey to kill Jakoby, but he is the orc that Jakoby saved and refuses to kill him. Sending his son away, he kills Jakoby himself. As he prepares to kill Ward, Tikka produces the wand and resurrects Jakoby, showing she is a Bright. The Fogteeth's [[Shamanism|shaman]] pronounces this to be part of a [[prophecy]], causing the clan to kneel to them, setting them free. Tikka explains that the Inferni believe that assembling three wands will allow them to resurrect the Dark Lord. She also reveals that she was once a member of the Inferni, but she fled the group and was sheltered by the Shield of Light. Leilah loaned her wand to a Bright assassin to kill Tikka, but she killed the assassin, taking the wand.\n\nUsing the wand to resurrect Jakoby has made Tikka gravely ill, and she can only be healed in a magical pool at the safe house. Returning there, they are ambushed by Leilah and her two enforcers. In the confrontation, Leilah's guards are killed, but Leilah holds Tikka helpless as Ward and Jakoby run out of ammunition. Ward deliberately grabs the wand, believing that the resulting explosion will kill all of them. To everyone's amazement, Ward survives handling the wand, revealing he is also a Bright. He kills Leilah with the wand, triggering an explosion that sets the building on fire. Tikka disappears and the injured Ward and Jakoby escape the building.\n\nIn the hospital, Ward and Jakoby, understanding that the federal agents want any hint of magical activity kept secret, give Kandomere a doctored account of the previous night's events.\n\nIn a public ceremony, Jakoby, Ward and Rodriguez are honored. Ward smiles as he spots Tikka moving through the crowd in disguise.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Daryl Ward, a human LAPD officer.\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Nick Jakoby, the nation's first [[orc]] police officer who is partnered with Daryl.\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as Leilah, an Inferni [[elf]] seeking control of the magic wand.\n* [[Lucy Fry]] as Tikka, a young Inferni elf who is in possession of the magic wand.\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Kandomere, a high ranking elvish federal agent with the US Department of Magic's Magic Task Force.\n* [[Ike Barinholtz]] as Pollard, a corrupt human LAPD officer who seeks to steal the wand for himself.\n* [[Happy Anderson]] as Hildebrandt Ulysses Montehugh, a human federal agent who works under Kandomere in the Magic Task Force.\n* [[Dawn Olivieri]] as Sherri Ward, Daryl's human wife and Sophia's mother.\n* [[Matt Gerald]] as Hicks, a corrupt human LAPD officer.\n* [[Margaret Cho]] as Ching, a corrupt human LAPD sergeant.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Dorghu, the imposing leader of the Fogteeth Orcs gang.\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Rodriguez, a human [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] deputy.\n* [[Ng\u00f4 Thanh V\u00e2n|Veronica Ngo]] as Tien, an Inferni elf enforcer working for Leilah.\n* [[Alex Meraz]] as Serafin, an Inferni elf enforcer working for Leilah.\n* Nadia Gray as Larika, an elf assassin working for Leilah.\n* Joseph Piccuirro as Brown, a corrupt human LAPD officer.\n* [[Enrique Murciano]] as Poison, the crippled leader of the human Altamira gang who uses a wheelchair.\n* Scarlet Spencer as Sophia Ward, Daryl and Sherri's human daughter.\n* [[Andrea Navedo]] as Perez, a human LAPD captain and Ward's superior.\n* [[Kenneth Choi]] as Yamahara, a human LAPD internal affairs detective.\n* Bobby Naderi as Arkashian, a human LAPD internal affairs detective.\n* [[Cle Shaheed Sloan]] as OG Mike, the Wards' human neighbor.\n* [[Chris Browning]] as Serling, a human questioned by the US Department of Magic's Task Force.\n* [[Joe Rogan]] as himself, he is seen interviewing an orc about Jakoby.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:David Ayer, Noomi Rapace, Joel Edgerton, Will Smith, Edgar Ramirez & Lucy Fry (35335177313).jpg|right|thumb|(L\u2013R): Director [[David Ayer]] and stars [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Will Smith]], [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], and [[Lucy Fry]] at the 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nDescribed as \"a contemporary cop thriller, but with fantastical elements\", the film was directed by [[David Ayer]] and stars [[Will Smith]] and [[Joel Edgerton]], with a script penned by [[Max Landis]], which Ayer rewrote.<ref name=\"Collider3-2-16\"/><ref name=\"Variety3-3-16\"/> Netflix officially picked up the film for a $90 million deal with filming beginning in fall 2016, making it the most expensive Netflix film to date.<ref name=budget>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/netflix-bright-deal-will-smith-david-ayer-movie/ |title=Netflix Makes Mammoth Deal for David Ayer's 'Bright' Starring Will Smith |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=March 18, 2016 |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]] |access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref> [[Noomi Rapace]] entered talks to join the cast in May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/noomi-rapace-will-smith-bright-david-ayer/ |title=Noomi Rapace in Talks to Join Will Smith in David Ayer's Bright |first=Adele |last=Ankers |date=May 19, 2016 |website=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Landis stated in an interview that official production was expected to begin in September 2016, but that they had already shot a small part in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/max-landis-bright-star-wars-interview/ |title=Watch: Max Landis Hopes 'Bright' Will Be His 'Star Wars' |first=Dave |last=Trumbore |date=July 25, 2016 |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]] |access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref> Ayer's frequent cinematographer, [[Roman Vasyanov]], was confirmed to be working on the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nofilmschool.com/2016/08/cinematographer-roman-vasyanov-shoots-anamorphic-suicide-squad |title=Why DP Roman Vasyanov Chose Anamorphic & More Tales from Shooting 'Suicide Squad' |first=Daron |last=James |date=August 19, 2016 |website=No Film School|publisher=NONETWORK|access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 15, 2016, [[Lucy Fry]] was added to the cast.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/david-ayers-bright-lands-lucy-937362 |title=David Ayer's 'Bright' Lands 'Mr. Church' Actress Lucy Fry |date=October 11, 2016 |first=Borys |last=Kit |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 17, 2016, [[Andrea Navedo]] was added to the cast.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/davie-ayer-netflix-bright-andrea-navedo-austin-hebert-burden-movie-1201837579/ |title=David Ayer-Helmed Thriller 'Bright' Adds Andrea Navedo;
