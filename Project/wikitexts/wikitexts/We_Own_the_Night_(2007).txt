The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $55 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], Bobby Green is the manager of the El Caribe [[nightclub]] in [[Brighton Beach]], which is frequented by Russian mobster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski and owned by Vadim's uncle Marat Buzhayev.\n\nBobby has distanced himself from his father, [[NYPD]] Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky, and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky. Bobby uses his mother's maiden name, Green, as his last name and stays on the sidelines enjoying a [[hedonistic]] life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez and best friend Louis \"Jumbo\" Falsetti.\n\nWhen Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in hope of arresting Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate. The incident strains Bobby's relationship with his father and brother even more, and Bobby and Joseph come to blows.\n\nThe police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim, who decides to retaliate. The next evening, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant and his unmarked police cruiser is firebombed. Joseph survives the ambush and is hospitalized for four months. Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim. Bobby resolves to help the police and, without his father's knowledge, goes undercover inside Vadim's cocaine-smuggling operation with a police [[Covert listening device|listening device]] hidden in a cigarette lighter. The device is discovered and Bobby narrowly escapes being murdered as the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim.\n\nBobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody and their relationship begins to deteriorate. When Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital, Burt and the police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location. During a torrential rainstorm the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim's men, and during a chaotic car chase Burt is fatally shot. When he sees his father's body, Bobby blacks out in the rain.\n\nThe police take Bobby and Amada back to their motel near Kennedy Airport. Bobby wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the motel room. Joseph tells him that their father has been shot and killed. At the funeral, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro, gives him Burt's Korean War medal. Bobby is told that a Russian shipment of cocaine is arriving sometime in the coming week.\n\nTo avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him. After he is sworn into the NYPD, Bobby learns the true involvement of Jumbo and Marat. He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989. During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue. Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out. As the beds are engulfed in flame and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait. Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him.\n\nNearly a year after the raid on El Caribe, Bobby, now in uniform, graduates from the NYPD Police Academy to become a full-time police officer. Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting led him to realize that he needs to spend more time with his children. As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictorian address, Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience, but it turns out to be an illusion. Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Robert Grusinsky / Bobby Green\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Captain Joe Grusinsky\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Amada Juarez\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Deputy Chief Albert \"Burt\" Grusinsky\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Lieutenant Michael Solo\n* [[Moni Moshonov]] as Marat Buzhayev\n* [[Oleg Taktarov]] as Pavel Lubyarski\n* [[Danny Hoch]] as Louis \"Jumbo\" Falsetti\n* [[Tony Musante]] as Captain Jack Shapiro\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Lieutenant Spiro Giavannis\n* [[Alex Veadov]] as Vadim Nezhinski\n* Dominic Colon as Freddie\n* Craig Walker as Detective Russell De Keifer\n* [[Yelena Solovey]] as Kalina Buzhayev\n* [[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]] as Himself\n* [[Ed Koch]], who was [[Mayor of New York City]] during the time frame in which the film is set, makes a cameo appearance as himself.\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Critics|Critical response|Reception}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 57% of 153 critics gave the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.
