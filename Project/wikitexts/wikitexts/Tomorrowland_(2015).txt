Frank is approached by a young girl, Athena, who hands him an orange [[lapel pin]] with a blue \"T\" embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto [[Walt Disney]]'s \"[[It's a Small World]]\" attraction at the Fair's [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] Pavilion. Frank obeys and sneaks onto the ride, where the pin is scanned by a laser, and he is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world.\n\nIn the present day, [[optimism|optimistic]] teenager Casey Newton repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a [[NASA]] launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie, is a NASA engineer, but faces losing his job. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a pin in her belongings. While touching it, the pin transports her to Tomorrowland. Her adventure is cut short when the pin's battery runs out.\n\nWith help from her younger brother Nate, Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The owners attack her when she is unable to divulge where she got the pin, insisting that Casey knows about a \"little girl\". Athena bursts in and defeats the owners, actually [[Audio-Animatronics]], who self-destruct, blowing apart the shop. After Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena reveals she is an animatronic, purposed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey off outside an adult Frank's house in [[Pittsfield, New York]].\n\nThe reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey's request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank's house, Casey finds a probability counter marking the end of the world. Frank warns her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees, thus lowering the counter's probability. Animatronic assassins arrive to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape, meeting Athena in the woods outside Frank's house. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature, but reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland.\n\nUsing a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. Frank explains that [[Gustave Eiffel]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Thomas Edison]] co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use an antique rocket, called the ''Spectacle'', hidden beneath the Eiffel Tower to travel to Tomorrowland.\n\nThere, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. David Nix, Tomorrowland's governor, greets them. They travel to a [[tachyon]] [[Tachyonic antitelephone|machine]], invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the world will end, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince David to listen, he refuses and intends to have the group leave Tomorrowland.\n\nCasey realizes the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. They confront David, who admits he tried to prevent the future by projecting such images to humanity as a warning. Instead, they embraced the [[apocalypse]], refusing to act to make a better future for their world. Believing that humanity simply gave up, David has also given up and intends to allow the apocalypse to happen. Casey, Frank, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with David. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning David's leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by David, and she jumps in the way of his attack, mortally wounding herself. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine, which falls on David, killing him.\n\nIn the present, Casey and Frank lead Tomorrowland, recruit Eddie and Nate, and create a new group of recruitment animatronics like Athena, whom they were addressing at the beginning of the film. Given pins, the animatronic children set out to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- - main cast per closing credits scroll order- -->\n\n* [[George Clooney]] as John Francis \"Frank\" Walker, a grizzled inventor\n:* Thomas Robinson as Young Frank Walker\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as David Nix, leader of Tomorrowland\n* [[Britt Robertson]] as Casey Newton, an optimistic and tech-savvy teenager\n:* [[Shiloh Nelson]] as Young Casey Newton\n* [[Raffey Cassidy]] as Athena, an [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] droid recruiter \n* [[Tim McGraw]] as Eddie Newton, Casey's father and [[NASA]] engineer\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Ursula, store owner and one of Nix's assassins\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[Hugo Gernsback]], store owner and another of Nix's assassins\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Mr. Walker, Frank's dad\n* [[Pierce Gagnon]] as Nate Newton, Casey's brother\n* Matthew Maccaull as Dave Clark\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Jenny Newton, Casey's mother\n* [[Garry Chalk]] as Jail Desk Jockey\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2010, [[Damon Lindelof]] began discussions with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] about producing a modern science-fiction Disney film, with [[Tomorrowland]] as a basis.<ref name=DInsiderJune>{{cite news|title=Tomorrowland Writer Jeff Jensen Reveals the Movie's Secret History|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/05/29/tomorrowland-writer-jeff-jensen-reveals-the-movies-secret-history/|access-date=October 14, 2015|work=Disney Insider|date=June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918223059/http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/05/29/tomorrowland-writer-jeff-jensen-reveals-the-movies-secret-history/|archive-date=September 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The project was greenlit by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' president of production, [[Sean Bailey]] in June 2011 with Lindelof signed on to write and produce a film with the working title of ''1952''.<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title='Lost's Damon Lindelof Makes 7-Figure Disney Deal To Write Secret Sci-Fi Feature|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/06/losts-damon-lindelof-makes-7-figure-disney-deal-to-write-secret-sci-fi-feature/|access-date=January 29, 2013|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408011803/http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/losts-damon-lindelof-makes-7-figure-disney-deal-to-write-secret-sci-fi-feature/|archive-date=April 8, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Lindelof asked [[Jeff Jensen]]&nbsp;\u2014 who had previously published material on Lindelof's ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' television series&nbsp;\u2014 if he was interested in contributing to story elements.
