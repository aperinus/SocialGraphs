It takes place aboard the ''Snowpiercer'' train as it travels a globe-encircling track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after a failed attempt at [[climate engineering]] to stop [[global warming]] has created a new [[Snowball Earth]]. Evans stars as Curtis Everett, leader of the lower-class tail-section passengers, as they rebel against the elite of the front of the train. Filming took place at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, using train car sets mounted on [[gimbal]]s to simulate the train's motion.\n\n''Snowpiercer'' received critical acclaim, and appeared on many film critics' top ten lists of 2014 after its international release, with praise for its vision, direction, and performances, particularly by Evans and Swinton. In the United States, the film was initially planned for a limited-screen showing but the critical response prompted [[The Weinstein Company]] to expand the showing to more theaters and to digital streaming services. With a budget of $40 million, it remains one of the most expensive South Korean productions ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-koreas-polarizing-film-market-865018 |title=South Korea's Polarizing Film Market: Can Mid-Budget Genre Movies Survive? |author=Lee Hyo-won |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=13 February 2016 |access-date=14 February 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214220037/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-koreas-polarizing-film-market-865018 |archive-date=14 February 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-21|title=The 7 most expensive K-drama shows to ever hit your screens|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/3102331/most-expensive-k-drama-ever-netflixs-king-criminal|access-date=2020-12-31|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2031, 17 years after an attempt to stop [[Climate change|global warming]] via [[stratospheric aerosol injection]] catastrophically backfires and creates a new [[ice age]], the remnants of humanity have taken to a self-sustaining [[circumnavigation]]al train, the ''Snowpiercer'', run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n\nUrged by his father-figure, Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt after they realize the guards' weapons have no ammunition; bullets are believed to be extinct due to a previous revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist, who insists that his [[clairvoyant]] daughter, Yona, be freed as well. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress forward, but they find themselves facing guards with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. During the battle, the train goes into a tunnel, causing total darkness. The guard force, who have [[night vision]], begin picking off the blind rebels. However, the tail-sectioners launch a counterattack with torches and push the guards back. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis abandons him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is fatally stabbed. The tail army stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who have had their children taken from them) toward the front of the train.\n\nCurtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and consider that the ice may be thawing. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to open to celebrate the eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. The bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with loaded automatic guns hidden under the eggs, revealing that bullets still exist. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, this prompts Curtis to kill Mason. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong. The two, along with Yona, continue onward.\n\nIn the last car before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the drug Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can survive. Curtis stops them, as he wants to meet Wilford; Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, 17 years before, the tail section had resorted to cannibalism, and he had been ready to eat the infant Edgar but Gilliam offered him his arm instead. Curtis wants to face Wilford to ask why he created this [[closed ecosystem]]. The engine door opens, and Wilford's assistant Claude emerges and wounds Namgoong before inviting Curtis inside.\n\nCurtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. Wilford orders 74% of the tail passengers killed. He then offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept when Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and pulls open a floorboard to reveal Andrew and Tanya's children, Andy and Timmy, working the engine as [[Slavery|slaves]]. Appalled, Curtis knocks out Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Curtis gives Yona matches to light the fuse for the Kronole, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who had followed them, along with partygoers from another car. As the door to the engine room will not close, Curtis and Namgoong use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast.\n\nThe explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. With Namgoong unresponsive,  Yona escapes the wreckage with Timmy. They see a [[polar bear]] in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train. The bear notices them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Curtis Everett <br> The leader of the revolution.<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"RADiUS-TWC Snowpiercer Press Notes\">{{cite news|title=RADiUS-TWC Snowpiercer Press Notes |url=http://andy-bailey.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SNOWPIERCER-Press-Notes-FINAL.pdf |access-date=25 June 2014 |newspaper=[[RADiUS-TWC]] |date=25 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092136/http://andy-bailey.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/SNOWPIERCER-Press-Notes-FINAL.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref> About the character of Curtis, Evans said, \"I mean, for me, the tail section is, I think that's Curtis.
