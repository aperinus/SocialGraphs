During their meal, he narrates a story concerning how he changed his life by instigating an intricate gold bullion robbery. One year ago, Holland served as an unambitious London bank clerk, who for twenty years was in charge of gold bullion deliveries. Although dedicated to his job due to his reputation for fussing over details, he had begun to devise a scheme to steal a consignment of gold bullion. However, his plan had a flaw - selling it on the [[black market]] in Britain was too risky, and he was at a loss as to how to smuggle it abroad. One evening at his boarding house in [[Lavender Hill]], he meets with artist Alfred Pendlebury, who has taken up lodgings in the building. A conversation with him leads him to discover that Pendlebury owns a [[foundry]] that makes presents and souvenirs that are sold in holiday destinations, one of which is [[Paris]].\n\nRealizing that Pendlebury is the key to his plan's success, Holland explains his scheme to the artist who agrees to help. When the clerk discovers he is due to be transferred to another bank department, the pair quickly move their plan into action, recruiting the aid of petty thieves, Lackery Wood and Shorty Fisher. On the day of the robbery, Wood and Fisher hijack the bullion van and switch the gold to one of Pendlebury's works van. Holland then assumes the role of an unfortunate victim who is hailed as a hero for raising the alarm, after nearly drowning by accident. As his associates melt down the gold bullion and recast it as [[Eiffel Tower]] paperweights to be exported abroad, Holland gives false statements and misleading clues to the police, led by Inspector Farrow. The group soon toast to their success, despite Wood and Fisher being unable to travel to Paris to collect their share in person, entrusting the other two to provide it.\n\nThe day after their last consignment of stolen gold is sent to Paris, Holland and Pendlebury head to France to retrieve them from a souvenir kiosk atop the Eiffel Tower supplied by Pendlebury's firm. However, the pair are horrified when they find one of the boxes containing the golden paperweights has been opened by mistake due to a language mix-up. Discovering six have been sold to a group of English schoolgirls, the pair make a wild chase to pursue after them back to Britain. Both manage to track down the schoolgirls, but only manage to get back five of the paperweights. The girl holding the sixth one refuses, intending to deliver it to a policeman she is friends with. Holland and Pendlebury pursue after the girl, and watch in horror as it is brought to an exhibition of police history and methods at [[Hendon Police College]]. Holland's worst fears come true when Farrow, having begun to realize the truth, spots the paperweight and orders a chemical test on it.\n\nLeft with no choice, Holland snatches it, and he and Pendlebury make their escape in a stolen police car. A confusing pursuit begins across London, as Holland uses the car's radio to feed false, misleading information to the officers pursuing the pair. However, both find themselves forced to offer a passing police officer a lift on the car's footplate, causing them to be eventually discovered. As Pendlebury becomes trapped, Holland escapes with the six golden paperweights, which leave him with a tidy sum to enjoy a new life. After finishing his tale to his visitor back in the present day, Holland admits that the money is now all gone. As the pair prepare to leave, the visitor is revealed  as a police officer, and that Holland has been finally arrested for his crime as the story concludes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Alec Guinness]] as Henry \"Dutch\" Holland\n*[[Stanley Holloway]] as Alfred \"Al\" Pendlebury\n*[[Sid James]] as Lackery Wood\n*[[Alfie Bass]] as Shorty Fisher\n*[[Marjorie Fielding]] as Mrs. Chalk\n*[[Edie Martin]] as Miss Evesham\n*[[John Salew]] as Parkin\n*[[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]] as Turner\n*[[Arthur Hambling]] as Wallis\n*[[Gibb McLaughlin]] as Godwin\n*[[John Gregson]] as Inspector Farrow\n*[[Clive Morton]] as Station Sergeant\n*[[Sydney Tafler]] as Clayton\n*[[Marie Burke]] as Senora Gallardo\n*[[Audrey Hepburn]] as Chiquita\n*[[William Fox (actor)|William Fox]] as Gregory\n*[[Michael Trubshawe]] as British Ambassador\n*[[Jacques Brunius|Jacques B.
