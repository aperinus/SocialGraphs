The film stars [[Brian O'Halloran]], [[Jeff Anderson]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Trevor Fehrman]], [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith]], [[Jason Mewes]], and Smith, and picks up with the original characters from ''Clerks'': [[Dante Hicks]], [[Randal Graves]] and [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ten years after the events of the first film. Unlike the first film, which was shot in black-and-white, this film was shot in color.\n\nThe film screened out of competition at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4370295/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Clerks II |access-date=2009-12-17|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and won the Audience Award at the 2006 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]]<ref>[http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/news/articles/feature_film_award_winners_for_2006_announced News \u2013 Edinburgh International Film Festival<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929104634/http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/news/articles/feature_film_award_winners_for_2006_announced |date=September 29, 2006 }}</ref> before receiving a theatrical release on July 21, 2006 to critical and commercial success, grossing $27 million worldwide from a $5 million budget. A [[Clerks III|third film]] was released in 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\nTen years after [[Clerks (film)|the events of the first film]], [[Dante Hicks|Dante]] opens the [[Quick Stop]] convenience store to find that it is on fire as [[Randal Graves|Randal]] had left the coffee pot on after closing the night before. Because Quick Stop and the adjacent RST Video have been destroyed in the fire, Dante and Randal begin working at a [[Mooby the Golden Calf|Mooby's]] fast food restaurant along with teenager [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Elias Grover|Elias Grover]] and their manager [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Becky Scott|Becky Scott]].\n\nA year later, Dante is planning to leave his [[minimum wage]] lifestyle in favor of a family life in [[Florida]] with his fianc\u00e9e Emma Bunting, whose rich father will provide them with a home and a car wash business to run. Afraid of losing his best friend, Randal becomes resentful towards Dante and Emma's relationship. [[Jay and Silent Bob]] have followed Dante and Randal, and now loiter outside of Mooby's. Although they continue to sell drugs, Jay and Silent Bob have become sober after they were arrested for possession and sent to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]; they become devout [[Christians]] after their release.\n\nDante tells Becky that he is worried about dancing at his wedding, so she takes him up to the restaurant's roof to teach him some moves. Dante soon releases his inhibitions and begins dancing. When the song ends, Dante, caught up in the moment, confesses his love for Becky, and she reveals that she's [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] as a result of a [[one-night stand]] they had at work a few weeks prior. Becky tells Dante not to tell anyone about the baby; however, he tells Randal, and an angered Becky leaves when she finds out.\n\nRandal encourages Dante to leave Mooby's in search of Becky, so he can set up a surprise going away party for him. Randal hires \"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud,\" a [[donkey show]], with a fog machine for the party. When Dante returns, he mistakes the fog for fire and calls the fire department, but upon discovering that it's not a fire, proceeds to watch with Randal, Jay, Silent Bob, and Elias. \n\nThe group discovers that \"Kinky Kelly\" is, in fact, the donkey, while the man, whom Randal thought to be the [[pimp]], is \"The Sexy Stud\". When Becky returns, she admits that she too loves Dante. As they kiss, Emma arrives with a cake she made for Dante. She throws her engagement ring at Becky, dumps the cake over Dante's head, knees him in the crotch, and storms off.\n\nThe fire and police departments arrive, and Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay, Silent Bob, and The Sexy Stud are arrested as a result of the show. Although they are informed they'll be released without being charged, Dante blames Randal for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness to start a new life without him, while Randal condemns Dante for his willingness to live his life under the standards of others and for abandoning their friendship. \n\nDuring the argument, Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it themselves, although Dante says that neither have the money to do it. Jay and Silent Bob offer to lend them the money (from the royalties they collected from the ''Bluntman and Chronic'' movie in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'') provided that they can hang out outside of the store anytime they want without the police being called. Randal accepts their offer, but Dante is uncertain, prompting Randal to emotionally confess his fear of losing Dante.\n\nMoved by Randal's confession, Dante agrees to the proposition. After the group are released, Dante proposes to Becky, who happily accepts. After the Quick Stop and RST Video are rebuilt, Elias applies for a job and is hired at RST Video. \n\nIn the very last scene, with the store open, Dante tells Randal, \"Can you feel it? Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.\" The color evaporates from the film and the camera pulls back to reveal the milk maid from the first movie still going through all the gallons.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brian O'Halloran]] as [[Dante Hicks]]\n* [[Jeff Anderson]] as [[Randal Graves]]\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Becky Scott|Becky Scott]]\n* [[Trevor Fehrman]] as [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Elias Grover|Elias Grover]]\n* [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith|Jennifer Schwalbach]] as [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Emma Bunting|Emma Bunting]]\n* [[Jason Mewes]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Jay]]\n* [[Kevin Smith]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]]\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Lance Dowds|Lance Dowds]]\n* [[Zak Charles Knutson|Zak Knutson]] as Sexy Stud\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Angry customer\n* [[Earthquake (comedian)|Earthquake]] as Angry customer's husband\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Weed customer\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Gawking customer\n* [[Kevin Weisman]] as Lord of the Rings geek\n* [[Scott Mosier]] as Concerned Father\n* [[Walt Flanagan]] as Quick Stop Customer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn 1999, the original title was slated to be ''Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin{{'}}'' (cf. [[Jerry Lewis]]'s ''[[Hardly Working]]''), as seen in the credits of ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. Smith later modified the title to ''The Passion of the Clerks'', lampooning the title of [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. According to the DVD documentary, the title was changed to simply ''Clerks II'', due to negative reaction to the \"Passion\" title. The film was shot from September to November 2005. It was originally scheduled for a 2005 release, and then a January 2006 release, but the production was pushed back due to other projects and Kevin Smith's involvement in the romantic comedy ''[[Catch and Release (2006 film)|Catch and Release]]''.\n\nSmith released production diaries on the ''Clerks II'' website (see [[#External links|links]] below). They chronicle the entire making of the film from the first rehearsals all the way through to the final release. Some of these web diaries are also available on the two-disc [[DVD]] of the film. Smith released a Web-only teaser trailer on the ''Clerks II'' website on January 9, 2006,<ref name=\"teaser\">[http://www.clerks2.com/teaser/ Clerks 2 - Teaser] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929073935/http://www.clerks2.com/teaser/ |date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref> and a web-only trailer on April 2, 2006.<ref name=\"teaser\" /> Smith also released several shorts featuring action figures from his previous films to promote the film.\n\nBefore the release of the film, Smith had mentioned releasing an [[MP3]] file commentary to be downloaded and listened to in movie theaters via [[iPod]]. Ultimately, theater owners and exhibitors objected,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and the plan was scrapped. The abandoned commentary, featuring Smith, [[Scott Mosier]] and Jeff Anderson, is included on the DVD.\n\nThe bookend Quick Stop scenes are in black and white (to simulate the original visual style of ''Clerks''), while the rest of the film is in color. Smith has said that much of the film's color was [[Colorfulness|desaturated]] almost to the point where the film had a similar texture to the first film.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The contrast in color saturation used can be seen in the \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\" sequence in which a more vibrant and saturated [[color temperature]] is used to give a warm and sunny look that adds to the playful nature of the piece.\n\nOn the film's [[MySpace]] account, a contest was held in which the first 10,000 MySpace users who added ''Clerks II'' as a friend would have their name in the theatrical and DVD end credits; the list follows the View Askew and [[The Weinstein Company|Weinstein Company]] logos. The names are not present in the credits on the [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n=== Locations ===\nThe Mooby's restaurant was a shut-down [[Burger King]] at 8572 Stanton Ave in [[Buena Park, California]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://clerks2.com/images/pics/moobyssm.jpg |title=Images |publisher=Clerks2.com |access-date=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708164009/http://clerks2.com/images/pics/moobyssm.jpg |archive-date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref> (near [[Knott's Berry Farm]]), that has since been demolished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=8572+Stanton+Ave,+buena+park,+ca&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=8572+Stanton+Ave,+Buena+Park,+CA+90620&gl=us&ei=HvlRTJWeFIKingeH1JmTAw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ8gEwAA |title=8572 Stanton Ave, buena park, ca |publisher=Google Maps |access-date=14 September 2010}}</ref> The final days of principal photography were filmed at the Quick Stop and RST Video store in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], with some exceptions, the most notable being the go-kart scene, which was shot at Speedzone in [[Industry, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.themoviedistrict.com/clerks-ii/|title=Clerks II (2006) Filming Locations|website=The Movie District|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> The opening sequence where Randal and Dante are driving to work is a montage of Route 35, mostly in Middletown, New Jersey.\n\n=== Casting ===\nBrian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, and Kevin Smith all reprised their roles from the first film.\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary{{Specify|date=January 2009}},<!--there are multiple commentaries--> Kevin Smith originally wanted to cast his wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith as Becky. Executive producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] objected, however, wanting a known actress to play the role for marketing reasons. Other actresses that Smith had met with were [[Sarah Silverman]] and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] who both declined. Smith recalls having lunch with Howard who said she was interested in the film but ultimately passed in order to do ''[[Lady in the Water]]''. Silverman said she didn't want to play the Becky character as she had been cast as girlfriends in numerous other productions and feared type-casting, but loved the script and would have been more than willing to play the part of Randal Graves. [[Rachel Weisz]] was another name the studio considered, but Smith figured she would turn the role down and never offered her the part. [[Ellen Pompeo]] expressed an interest but could not commit due to scheduling difficulties with ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Finally, the role was offered to Rosario Dawson who loved the script. She later said that reading the \"donkey show\" scene sealed the deal for her. Schwalbach Smith was given the secondary female role of Emma. Smith also cast his daughter [[Harley Quinn Smith]] as the little girl Dante waves to in the window and his mother Grace as the Milk Maid, reprising her role from the first film. [[Walt Flanagan]] makes a cameo appearance as a customer who asks for a \"pack of cigarettes\" (after the scheme changes from color to black 'n' white), in a nod to the first film as well.\n\nThe character of Elias was played by Trevor Fehrman who had previously worked in Anderson's film ''[[Now You Know (film)|Now You Know]]''. Smith saw him in the film and was impressed enough to give him a part. In keeping with Smith's tradition of casting actors that he has previously worked with, both [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] and [[Ben Affleck]] had parts in the film. Lee played Lance Dowds and Affleck played a random Mooby's customer. After finding no one else who could pull off being the Sexy Stud, Smith turned to crew member Zak Charles Knutson to fill the role.\n\n== Release ==\n=== Rating ===\nThe film was originally planned to be released without an [[MPAA film rating system|MPAA film rating]], in order to avoid receiving an NC-17. Smith claimed \"If we put it in front of the ratings board they'd be like, 'You're insane. We have to create a new rating for that.'\"<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1521655/01262006/story.jhtml 'Clerks 2' An Unrated Classic, Smith Vows] from the [[MTV]] website</ref> However, he later submitted it, and it received an R rating without any edits.\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened in 2,150 theaters and grossed $10.1 million domestically in its first weekend.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The film's theatrical gross was $24.1 million domestically, plus an additional $2.8 million from other territoires foreign, against its production budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=clerks2.htm|title=Clerks II (2006) |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film holds a 63% approval rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 166 reviews with an average rating of 6.10/10.

O. Scott]] wrote that \"What makes ''Clerks II'' both winning and (somewhat unexpectedly) moving is its fidelity to the original ''Clerks'' ethic of hanging out, talking trash and refusing all worldly ambition.
