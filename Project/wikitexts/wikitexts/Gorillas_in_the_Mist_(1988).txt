It tells the story of her work in [[Rwanda]] with [[mountain gorilla]]s and was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOccupational therapist [[Dian Fossey]] ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) is inspired by anthropologist [[Louis Leakey]] ([[Iain Cuthbertson]]) to devote her life to the study of primates. She writes ceaselessly to Leakey for a job cataloging and studying the rare [[mountain gorilla]]s of [[Africa]]. Following him to a lecture in Louisville, Kentucky in 1966, she convinces him of her conviction.\n\nThey travel to the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Congo]], where Leakey and his foundation equip her to make contact with the gorillas, and introduce her to a local animal tracker, Sembagare (John Omirah Miluwi). Settling deep in the jungle, Fossey and Sembagare locate a troop of gorillas, but are displaced by the events of the [[Congo Crisis]] and forcibly evicted from their research site by Congolese soldiers, who accuse Fossey of being a foreign spy and agitator.\n\nFossey is resigned to returning to the United States, but Sembagare and her temporary host [[Rosamond Carr]] ([[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]]) motivate her to stay in Africa. Fossey establishes new research efforts in the jungles of neighboring [[Rwanda]], where rampant [[poaching]] and [[corruption]] become apparent when she discovers several traps near her [[Karisoke Research Center|new base]] at Karisoke. Nevertheless, Fossey and her colleagues make headway with the gorillas, taking account of their communication and social groups. Her work impresses Leakey and gains international attention.\n\n''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', which funds her efforts, dispatches photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]] ([[Bryan Brown]]) to highlight her research. Fossey, initially unreceptive, grows increasingly attached to Campbell after several photo sessions with the gorillas, and the two become lovers, in spite of Campbell's marriage. Campbell proposes to divorce his wife and marry Fossey but insists that she would have to spend time away from Karisoke and her gorillas, leading her to end their relationship. Fossey forms an emotional bond with a gorilla named Digit, and attempts to prevent the export of other gorillas by trader Van Vecten (Constantin Alexandrov).\n\nAppalled by the poaching of the gorillas for their skins, hands, and heads, Fossey complains to the [[Government of Rwanda|Rwandan government]] and is dismissed, but a government minister (Waigwa Wachira) promises to hire an anti-poaching squad. Fossey's frustrations reach a climax when Digit is beheaded by poachers. She leads numerous anti-poaching patrols, burns down the poachers' villages, and even stages a mock execution of one of the offenders, serving to alienate some of her research assistants and gaining her various enemies. Sembagare expresses concern at Fossey\u2019s opposition to the emergent industry of gorilla tourism, but she nonchalantly dismisses his worries.\n\nOn December 27, 1985, Dian Fossey is murdered in the bedroom of her cabin by an unseen assailant. At a funeral attended by Sembagare, Carr, and others, she is buried in the same cemetery where Digit and other gorillas had been laid to rest. Sembagare symbolically links the graves of Fossey and Digit with stones as a sign that their souls rest in peace together before leaving.\n\nThe epilogue text explains that Fossey\u2019s actions helped save the gorillas from extinction, while her death remains a mystery.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dian Fossey]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]\n* [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as [[Rosamond Carr|Roz Carr]]\n* John Omirah Miluwi as Sembagare\n* [[Iain Cuthbertson]] as Dr. [[Louis Leakey]]\n* Constantin Alexandrov as Van Vecten\n* Waigwa Wachira as Mukara\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Brendan\n* David Lansbury as Larry\n* [[Maggie O'Neill]] as Kim\n* Konga Mbandu as Rushemba\n* [[Michael J.

And by all accounts Fossey was anything but ordinary.\" He also accused the filmmakers of toning down Fossey's unstable mental state: \"Fossey was more than merely eccentric...The movie hints at these aspects of her character but tries to soften them;...the filmmakers have done more than sanitize Fossey's life, they've deprived it of any meaning.\" Hinson concluded that \"''Gorillas in the Mist'' isn't a terrible film, but it is a frustrating one.\"\n\nWhile [[Roger Ebert]] was also happy with the casting of Weaver as Fossey (\"It is impossible to imagine a more appropriate choice for the role\"),<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Gorillas in the Mist|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880923/REVIEWS/809230303|website=Roger Ebert |publisher=Roger Ebert|date=September 23, 1988|access-date=13 June 2011}}</ref> he felt the character was too distanced from the audience and that her development and motives were unclear. \"''Gorillas in the Mist'' tells us what Dian Fossey accomplished and what happened to her, but it doesn't tell us who she was, and at the end that's what we want to know.\" However, Ebert was impressed by the scenes with the gorillas and the way live footage of gorillas was seamlessly blended with gorilla costumes: \"Everything looked equally real to me, and the delicacy with which director Michael Apted developed the relationships between woman and beast was deeply absorbing. There were moments when I felt a touch of awe. Those moments, which are genuine, make the movie worth seeing.\"\n\nHinson also agreed that \"whenever the cameras turn on the gorillas \u2014 who are the film's true stars \u2014 you feel you're witnessing something truly great.\"\n\nThe film holds an 85% fresh rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 critics' reviews, with an average review of 6.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gorillas_in_the_mist|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Box-office===\n''Gorillas in the Mist'' started an exclusive run on 15 screens on September 23, 1988 and grossed $366,925.<ref name=mojo/> It expanded to 558 screens the following weekend and was the number one film for the weekend with a gross of $3,451,230.<ref name=mojo/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Gorillas' Goes Ape; 'Delancey' Keen; 'Hotel' A Disney Heartbreaker|page=3|date=October 5, 1988|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|author-link=Todd McCarthy}}</ref> The film went on to gross $24,720,479 in the United States and Canada and $36,429,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $61,149,479.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
