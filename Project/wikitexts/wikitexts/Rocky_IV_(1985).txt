It also stars [[Talia Shire]], [[Burt Young]], [[Carl Weathers]], [[Brigitte Nielsen]], and [[Dolph Lundgren]]. In the film, [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone) fights [[Ivan Drago]] (Lundgren), a Soviet boxer responsible for causing a personal tragedy. ''Rocky IV'' was Dolph Lundgren's first American film debut, and Stallone's last directorial effort [[Rocky Balboa (film)|until 2006]].\n\nDevelopment for a fourth ''Rocky'' film began soon after the success of ''Rocky III'', which faced controversy after it was subject to a [[Anderson v. Stallone|copyright lawsuit]]. [[Principal photography]] began in 1984, with filming locations including [[Philadelphia]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Vancouver]]. Stallone and Lundgren engaged in authentic punching in their fight, which led to Stallone being admitted to [[intensive care]]. Filming also featured new special effects and bona fide and groundbreaking sport methods and equipment, some of which were years removed from public use. ''Rocky IV'' is known for its strong [[Cold War]] themes, and for its successful theme songs \"[[Burning Heart (song)|Burning Heart]]\" and \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\".\n\n''Rocky IV'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on November 21, 1985, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[MGM/UA Entertainment Co.|MGM/UA]] on November 27.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sports Drama |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=sportsdrama.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film received mixed to negative reviews, with criticism for its predictable screenplay and Cold War themes, which some critics deemed as propaganda and facilitating negative portrayals of Russians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vhsrevival.com/2018/07/10/burning-hearts-and-iron-curtains-rocky-iv-and-cold-war-propaganda/|title=Burning Hearts and Iron Curtains: Rocky IV & Cold War Propaganda|first=Edison|last=Smith|date=July 10, 2018|accessdate=April 26, 2022}}</ref> However, there was some praise for Drago's credibility as a villain. Despite its reception, the film was a box office success, grossing $300 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film in the franchise and the third [[1985 in film|highest grossing film of 1985]], and the critical reception became more favorable in the years later, with the praise for the training montage.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rocky Movies|access-date = September 17, 2007 |work=Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC. |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=rocky.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607221410/http://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=rocky.htm|archive-date = June 7, 2007}}</ref> In 2021, a director's cut was released with the title ''Rocky IV: Rocky vs Drago'', receiving positive reviews from critics. The sequel, ''[[Rocky V]]'', was released in 1990.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, Soviet boxer Ivan Drago arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer, and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, former heavyweight champion [[Apollo Creed]] challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations but agrees to help train Apollo for the match.\n\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The [[Exhibition fight|boxing exhibition]] takes place at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>Block, Marcelline (2011). ''World Film Locations: Las Vegas''. Intellect Books. Pages 40\u201341. {{ISBN|9781841505886}}.</ref> Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with [[James Brown]] performing \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers|Duke]], plead with him to stop the match, but Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to [[corner stoppage|throw in the towel]]. Rocky honors Apollo's wishes, which allows Drago to beat Apollo to death in the ring. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nFrustrated by the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, but has to surrender his championship to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the United States. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without  [[Adrian Pennino|his wife Adrian]] due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogourbinsk]] with only Duke and Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of [[anabolic steroids]]. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\n\nBefore the match begins, Balboa is the first to enter to a hostile crowd. As he waits nervously in the ring, the lights in the arena suddenly go out, and Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] and the [[Politburo]] in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man, and not a machine as he's been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\n\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. As the 12th round begins, the previously hostile Soviet crowd suddenly start chanting and cheering for Balboa. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing the Soviet leadership, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, but manages to stay on his feet. Both fighters trade blows, before Balboa seizes an opening, unleashing a series of vicious blows, eventually knocking out Drago and avenging Apollo's death.\n\nRocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares: \"During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing, the way you felt about me, and in the way I felt about you. In here, there were two guys killing each other, but I guess that's better [[World War III|than 20 million]]. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change!\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": The reigning two-time Heavyweight Champion of the World.\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky.\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Ludmilla Vobet Drago|Ludmilla Vobet Drago]]: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and Olympic swimming champion.

Adams]], [[Barry Tompkins]] and [[Al Bandiero]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nSportscaster [[Stu Nahan]] makes his fourth appearance in the series as commentator for the Creed\u2013Drago fight. [[Warner Wolf]] replaces Bill Baldwin, who died following filming for ''[[Rocky III]]'', as co-commentator. For the fight between Rocky and Drago, commentators [[Barry Tompkins]] and [[Al Bandiero]] portray themselves as [[USA Network]] broadcasters.\n\nApollo Creed's wife Mary Anne (Sylvia Meals) made her second appearance in the series, the first being ''[[Rocky II]]'', although the character was mainly featured in ''Rocky II''. Stallone's future wife, Brigitte Nielsen, appeared as Drago's wife, Ludmilla.\n\nThe Soviet premier in the sky box during the Rocky\u2013Drago match, played by David Lloyd Austin, strongly resembles contemporary Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Austin later played Gorbachev in ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|The Naked Gun]]'', and Russian characters in other films.\n\n===Filming===\n\n[[Wyoming]] doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union. The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in [[Jackson Hole]], and [[Grand Teton National Park]] was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The [[PNE Agrodome]] at [[Hastings Park]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to [[Saint John's Health Center|Saint John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Santa Monica]], and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing.<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 |title=Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News |publisher=AICN |access-date=January 25, 2007}}</ref> Producer Winkler describes the exact same event in his autobiography, observing not Lundgren, rather, \"Sly took a punch from a [[stand-in]] fighter and ended up in the emergency room with his blood pressure dangerously high.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Winkler |first=Irwin |title=A Life in Movies |publisher=Abrams Press |year=2019 |isbn=9781683355281 |location=New York|pages=111}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo-vs.-Drago \"exhibition\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.<ref name=\"AICN\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\n\n''Rocky IV'' is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |title='It's in the game': sport fans, film and digital gaming |first=G. |last=Crawford |journal=Sport in Society |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=130\u2013145 |doi=10.1080/17430430701823380 |s2cid=145127121}}</ref> The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Hoff |first=D. |title=Rocky IV-Fight Medicine |journal=Medical Grand Rounds Presented at University of Texas Health Science Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Boxing and Medicine |first=R.

''Rocky IV'' is the only film in the series not to feature original music by [[Bill Conti]], who was replaced by DiCola; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as \"The Final Bell\". Conti, who was too busy with the first two ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' films at the time, would return for ''[[Rocky V]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\", does not appear at all in ''Rocky IV'' (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental.\n\nSongs from the movie included \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", by [[James Brown]], and also music by [[John Cafferty]] (\"[[Heart's on Fire (John Cafferty song)|Heart's on Fire]]\", featuring Vince DiCola), [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], [[Kenny Loggins]], and [[Robert Tepper]].
