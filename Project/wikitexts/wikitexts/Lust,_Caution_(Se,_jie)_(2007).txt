Male student Kuang Yu Min invites her to join his patriotic drama club and she soon becomes a lead actress, inspiring both her audience and her colleagues. Inspired by the club's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a [[special agent]] and recruiter of the puppet government of [[Wang Jingwei]] set up by the Japanese occupation in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of \"Mrs. Mai\", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She inserts herself into the social circle of Mrs. Yee.\n\nChia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated. Chia Chi is still a virgin, and she reluctantly consents to having sex with another student involved in the plot in order to practice her role as a married woman. Kuang, who has feelings for Chia Chi, is upset by this but agrees to the arrangement. Attracted to Chia Chi, Yee nearly falls for the trap but withdraws at the last minute. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Yee move back to Shanghai, leaving the students with no further chance to complete their mission. While they are preparing to disband, an armed subordinate of Yee turns up unannounced and tells them that he is aware of their plans. After a violent struggle, the university students kill the subordinate and then go into hiding.\n\n'''Shanghai 1942'''\n[[File:Zheng Pingru 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese spy [[Zheng Pingru]], generally believed to have been the inspiration for the story]]\n\nThree years later, in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Chia Chi again encounters Kuang, who is now an undercover agent of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) secret service the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics|''Juntong'']], which is seeking to overthrow the Japanese occupation forces and the [[Wang Jingwei regime|puppet government]]. Kuang enlists her into a renewed assassination plan to kill Yee. By this time, Yee has become the head of the secret police department under the puppet government and is responsible for torturing and executing Chinese resistance members working for the KMT. Chia Chi's advances to become Yee's mistress are reciprocated. During their first sexual encounter, Yee violently rapes Chia Chi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lust-caution-18-768434.html|title=Lust, Caution (18)|date=2008-01-06|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Mark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSBdDwAAQBAJ&q=lust+caution+assault|title=Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|date=2018-01-19|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84457-783-5|language=en}}</ref> Over the next few weeks, their sexual relationship becomes more consensual and affectionate, stirring conflicting emotions within in Chia Chi's mind,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v30/n02/michael-wood/at-the-movies|title=Michael Wood \u00b7 At the Movies: 'Lust, Caution' \u00b7 LRB 24 January 2008|last=Wood|first=Michael|date=2008-01-24|journal=London Review of Books|volume=30|issue=2|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> who is still involved in the assassination plot.\n\nWhen Chia Chi reports to her KMT superior officer, she exhorts him to carry out the assassination soon so that she will not have to continue her sexual liaisons with Yee, but she is told that the assassination needs to be delayed for strategic reasons. Chia Chi describes the emotional conflict she finds herself embroiled in, sentimentally bound to a man whom she is plotting to assassinate. When Yee sends Chia Chi to a jewelry store with a sealed envelope, she discovers that he has arranged for a large and extremely rare six-carat pink diamond for her, to be mounted in a ring. This provides the Chinese resistance with a chance to get at Yee when he is not accompanied by his bodyguards.\n\nSoon after, Chia Chi invites Yee to accompany her to collect the diamond ring. While entering the jewelry shop, she notices that all her friends involved in the assassination plot are undercover outside. When she puts on the ring, she is overcome by emotion and quietly urges him to leave. Understanding her meaning, Yee immediately flees the shop and escapes the assassination attempt. By the end of the day, most members of the resistance group are captured. Yee's deputy was aware of the resistance cell, but did not inform Yee because he hoped to use the opportunity to catch their leader. Emotionally turmoiled, Yee signs the resistance members' death warrants. They, Chia Chi, are led out to a quarry to be executed. As the resistance members group are forced to their knees at gunpoint, a sad Kuang gazes at her. Meanwhile, Yee sits on Chia Chi's empty bed in the family guest room while his wife asks him what is going on, since his secretary and two men had taken Chia Chi's belongings and some papers from his office. Yee tells her to keep quiet and to continue playing downstairs, to avoid letting anyone know of his affection for Chia Chi.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width       = 350\n| image1            = Tang Wei2.jpg\n| caption1          = Wong Chia Chi is portrayed by [[Tang Wei]].\n| image2            = Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Berlin Film Festival 2013) (cropped).jpg\n| caption2          = Mr. Yee is portrayed by [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]].\n}}\n\n* [[Tang Wei]] as Wong Chia Chi/\"Mrs. Mai\"\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as Mr. Yee \n* [[Joan Chen]] as Mrs. Yee \n* [[Wang Leehom]] as Kuang Yumin \n* [[Tou Chung-hua]] as Old Wu\n* [[Chin Kar-lok]] as Assistant Officer Tsao\n* Chu Chih-ying as Lai Xiujin\n* Kao Ying-hsuan as Huang Lei \n* [[Lawrence Ko]] as Liang Junsheng \n* Johnson Yuen as Auyang Lingwen/\"Mr. Mai\" \n* [[Fan Kuang-yao]] as Secretary Chang\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Hali Salahuddin\n* [[Shyam Pathak]] as Jewelry Shopkeeper\n* Akiko Takeshita as Japanese Tavern Boss Lady\n* Hayato Fujiki as Japanese Colonel Sato\n\n==Production==\nThe actors who played university classmates, spent six months of preproduction in Hong Kong just to get into character and understand the period before filming.
