The 1972 film was produced by [[M. J. Frankovich]], released by [[Columbia Pictures]], directed by [[Milton Katselas]] and adapted for the screen by Gershe. It was released on July 6, 1972, in the U.S. The film is about a woman, Jill Tanner, who moves into an apartment beside a blind man, Don Baker, who has recently moved out on his own. The two become attracted to each other, and move in together, but Don's mother tries to end the romance, fearing that Jill will break her son's heart.\n\n[[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Edward Albert]] starred. [[Eileen Heckart]] received an [[Academy Award]] for her performance. While the original play was set in Manhattan, the screenplay written for the 1972 film was set in an unknown location in San Francisco.\n\n==Plot==\nIn San Francisco of the early 1970s, Don Baker, who was born [[Visual impairment|blind]], has lived all his life with his mother. When Don was young, Mrs. Baker wrote a series of popular children's books about Little Donny Dark, a blind boy who performs heroic deeds. Don moves into an apartment on his own, but finds himself all alone. He has made a contract that his mother will not come to see him for at least two months.\n\nOne month has passed. This is when Jill Tanner moves into an adjoining apartment. She listens to Don talking to his mother over the phone and turns on the radio. When Don asks her to turn the volume down, she invites herself over for a cup of coffee. They start talking and find each other friendly. Jill does not realize that Don is blind until she sees him dropping his cigarette ash on the table. Jill has never met a blind man before, so she asks all sorts of questions about how Don manages everyday chores.\n\nJill tells Don that her favorite quote is: \"I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies.\" (From [[Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]''.) She takes him to Asparagus, a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] clothing store, where owner Roy helps them pick out some free-spirited fashion. Back home, Don makes up a song and starts to sing \"Butterflies Are Free\" on his guitar. They discover they can unlock the door separating their two apartments.\n\nSurprising Don with a visit, Mrs. Baker sees that Don has attached himself to Jill. She also encounters them in the apartment partially undressed. She fears that Jill will break Don's heart. She takes Jill out for a lunch and tries to talk her out of Don's life. Jill has strong feelings for Don and tells Mrs. Baker that if there is someone who should get out of Don's life, it is she.\n\nFollowing Mrs. Baker's input, Jill later breaks a dinner date at Don's apartment, showing up much later with Ralph, the director of the play she has auditioned for. Jill hesitantly announces that she is moving in with Ralph, trying too hard to convince Don, and herself, that it is a great idea.\n\nWhen Jill goes to pack her things, a heartbroken Don asks his mother if he can move back home. She talks him out of it, pointing out that her Little Donny Dark books had been her way of helping young Don face his fears, and she (sadly) must do the same now. They finally make peace over their new roles in life. Jill and Don fight over her moving out, and Don tells her she is the one who is disabled. She leaves but returns to Don, and the two reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n <!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Jill Tanner\n* [[Edward Albert]] as Don Baker\n* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Mrs. Baker\n* [[Paul Michael Glaser|Michael Glaser]] as Ralph Santori\n* [[Michael Warren (actor)|Michael Warren]] as Roy\n\n==Reception==\n''Variety'' wrote: \"Although the setting has been changed from New York to San Francisco for no apparent reason, Leonard Gershe's screen adaptation of his successful Broadway play&nbsp;... is an excellent example of how to switch from one medium to another without sacrificing any of the qualities which makes the original version such a success.\"<ref name=\"variety\">\"Film Reviews: Butterflies Are Free\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. July 5, 1972. 16.</ref> The review further praises the acting of Goldie Hawn, saying: \"Miss Hawn, funny and touching, is a delight throughout and Miss Heckart finally gets another film role that enables her to display the versatility that has been evident for a long time in her stage roles.\"<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote: \"The film is not completely without intelligence, but its intelligence is in the service of the kind of sentimentality that shrivels the mind, like something left in water too long.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (July 7, 1972).

''[[The New York Times]]'': 19.</ref>\n\nCharles Champlin of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that \"a very well-made commercial play\u2014funny, sentimental, positive, tight\u2014has become a well-made commercial movie\u2014light, bright, extremely well and personably acted, and preserving the intimacy and the unity which were the virtues of the play.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (July 20, 1972). \"'Free' Flits From Stage to Screen\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.</ref>\n\nGene Siskel of the ''Chicago Tribune'' gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \"one of the attractive aspects of ''Butterflies Are Free'' is that each of the three characters is incomplete and flawed. To that degree the Leonard Gershe screenplay approaches believability, and this is a rare quality for a tear-jerker to have.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (August 10, 1972). \"Butterflies\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 5.</ref>\n\nGary Arnold of ''The Washington Post'' stated \"While the material is essentially shallow and often insufferable in its sentimental opportunism, Gershe and Katselas demonstrate some theatrical talent and mechanical aptitude&nbsp;... The play itself is nothing to brag about, but I doubt if one could transpose it much more adroitly and presentably. Instead of inflating or vulgarising this frail property, Katselas tries to keep it intimate and engaging.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (July 13, 1972). \"'Butterflies' Shallow but Diverting\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. D11.</ref>\n\nJohn Gillett of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote \"Occasionally it is all rather twee, plumping for the easy emotional response and the easy tear; yet much of the writing has sharpness and bite, notably in the initial meetings between Jill and Don, when they talk out their pasts together and improvise meals on the floor.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gillett |first=John |date=November 1972 |title=Butterflies Are Free |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=39 |issue=466 |pages=228\u2013229 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pointed out the talent of Goldie Hawn, stating: \"Goldie Hawn, as the girl next door, has come a long way from her giddy role in ''[[Laugh-In]]''; she is often genuinely touching.\"<ref name=\"timemag\">{{cite magazine |last=Cocks |first=Jay |author-link=Jay Cocks |date=July 24, 1972 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906169,00.html |title=Cinema: Dishonest Daydream |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022191943/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906169,00.html |archive-date=October 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Time'' praised the acting of both Edward Albert and Eileen Heckart: \"Edward Albert, the son of Actor [[Eddie Albert|Edward Albert]], is creditable as the blind boy, and Eileen Heckart is appropriately hateful as the mother, although she is unable to be convincing in her transformation.
