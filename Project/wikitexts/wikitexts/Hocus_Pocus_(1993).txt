Binx confronts the witches, but he fails to save Emily and her life force is drained, making the witches young again. After that, Binx is transformed into a [[black cat]] by the witches, cursed to live forever with his guilt for not saving Emily. \n\nHaving been alerted by Binx's friend Elijah, the townsfolk arrest the sisters for the murder of Emily. Before the Sanderson sisters are [[Hanging|hanged]] in the town square while they are denying any knowledge of what happened to Thackery, Winifred casts a [[curse]] that will resurrect the sisters during a full moon on [[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]] if a virgin lights the Black Flame Candle in their cottage. Binx decides to guard the cottage so no one can bring the witches back to life.\n\nThree centuries later, on October 31, 1993, Max Dennison reluctantly takes his younger sister Dani out [[trick-or-treating]] where they meet Max's new classmate Allison Watts whom he is attracted to. The three visit the former Sanderson cottage, now an abandoned museum, where Max inadvertently resurrects the witches. The witches attempt to suck the soul of Dani, but Max comes to her rescue. \n\nEscaping, Max steals Winifred's [[Grimoire|spellbook]] on advice from the immortal cat Binx. He takes the group to an old cemetery where they are protected from the witches since it is hallowed ground. The witches eventually catch up to them at the cemetery where Winifred raises her former love interest Billy Butcherson from the grave and sends him after the children.\n\nThe witches pursue the children across town using Mary's enhanced sense of smell. Winifred reveals that the spell that brought them back only works on Halloween and unless they can suck the life out of at least one child, they will turn to dust when the sun rises. After luring them to the high school, the children trap the witches in a [[Kiln|pottery kiln]] and burn them alive. However, whilst the children are celebrating, the witches' curse revives them again.\n\nNot realizing the witches have survived, Max and Allison open the spellbook, hoping to reverse the spell on Binx. The open spell book reveals the location of the group, and the witches track them down, kidnap Dani and Binx, and recover the spellbook. Sarah uses her singing to lure Salem's children to the Sanderson cottage. Max and Allison free Dani and Binx by tricking the witches into believing that sunrise was an hour early. Thinking that they are done for, the witches panic and pass out, allowing Max, Dani, Allison, and Binx to escape.\n\nBack at the cemetery, Billy catches up to the children, takes Max's knife, cuts his stitched mouth open, and insults Winifred before joining the children against the witches. The witches attack from the air and snatch Dani. Winifred attempts to use the last vial of potion to suck the soul of Dani, but Binx knocks the potion out of her hand which Max catches and promptly drinks, forcing the witches to take him instead of Dani. \n\nThe sun starts to rise just as Winifred is about to finish draining Max's life force. In the ensuing struggle, Allison, Dani, and Billy fend off Mary and Sarah. Max and Winifred, struggling in the air, fall onto the hallowed ground in the cemetery, causing Winifred to turn into stone. As the sun finishes rising above the horizon, Mary and Sarah are disintegrated into dust along with Winifred's stone body. \n\nThe witches' deaths break Binx's curse, allowing him to finally die and freeing his soul, reuniting him with Emily as they both head off into the afterlife while Billy returns to his grave to sleep. Winifred's spellbook opens its eye once more, revealing that it is still alive, indicating that the witches could [[Hocus Pocus 2|possibly return again someday]].\n\n== Cast ==\nSource:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hocus Pocus (1993) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7bedc1c1 |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=BFI |language=en}}</ref>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Winifred \"Winnie\" Sanderson, the smart leader of the sisters\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Sarah Sanderson, the dim-witted sister and younger witch who uses her siren-like voice to lure in children\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Mary Sanderson, the middle witch who can smell out children\n* [[Omri Katz]] as Maximilian \"Max\" Dennison, a sarcastic and smart aleck virgin teenager from Los Angeles who has recently moved to [[Salem, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Danielle \"Dani\" Dennison, Max's spoiled 8-year-old sister who loves Halloween\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Allison Watts, Max's love interest and classmate\n* Amanda Shepherd as Emily Binx, Thackery's little sister and 1693 victim of the Sanderson sisters\n* [[Larry Bagby]] as Ernie \"Ice\", a teenage bully in 20th-century Salem\n* Tobias Jelinek as Jay, a teenage bully in 20th-century Salem and Ice's best friend\n* [[Stephanie Faracy]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Dennison, Max and Dani's mother\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as David \"Dave\" Dennison, Max and Dani's father\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as William \"Billy\" Butcherson, a man poisoned by Winifred in 1693 and resurrected as a zombie 300 years later.

He and his young daughter were sitting outside and his neighbor's black cat strayed by. Kirschner invented a tale of how the cat was once a boy who was changed into a feline three hundred years ago by three witches.\n\n''Hocus Pocus'' started life as a script by [[Mick Garris]], that was bought by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 1984. The film's working title was ''Disney's Halloween House'', it was much darker and scarier, and its protagonists were all 12-year-olds. Garris and Kirschner pitched it to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]]; Spielberg saw Disney as a competitor to Amblin in the family film market at the time and refused to co-produce a film with his \"rival.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nVarious rewrites were made to the script to make the film more comedic and made two of its young protagonists into teenagers; however, production was stalled several times until 1992, when Bette Midler expressed interest in the script and the project immediately went forward.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://postmortempodcast.libsyn.com/25th-anniversary-of-hocus-pocus|title=Post Mortem with Mick Garris: 25th Anniversary of Hocus Pocus!|website=postmortempodcast.libsyn.com|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2018|archive-date=October 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009013346/https://postmortempodcast.libsyn.com/25th-anniversary-of-hocus-pocus|url-status=live}}</ref> Midler, who plays the central antagonist of the film (originally written for [[Cloris Leachman]]),<ref name=\":0\" /> is quoted as saying that ''Hocus Pocus'' \"was the most fun I'd had in my career up to that point\".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was originally offered the lead role of Max but he declined it in order to pursue ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]''.<ref name=\"LeoSource1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/510151/leonardo-dicaprio-reveals-what-movie-he-turned-down-even-after-being-offered-more-money-than-i-ever-dreamed-of|title=Leonardo DiCaprio Reveals What Movie He Turned Down Even After Being Offered \"More Money Than I Ever Dreamed Of\"|publisher=E!

Wallace also analyzes [[Walt Disney World]]'s Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular as part of the film's legacy and includes \"the largest collection of ''Hocus Pocus'' fun facts and trivia ever assembled\", complete with extensive endnote citations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2016/08/30/author-aaron-wallace-announces-first-ever-book-dedicated-disneys-hocus-pocus/|title=Author Aaron Wallace Announces First-Ever Book Dedicated to Disney's \"Hocus Pocus\" - LaughingPlace.com|first=Laughing Place Disney|last=Newsdesk|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924031012/http://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2016/08/30/author-aaron-wallace-announces-first-ever-book-dedicated-disneys-hocus-pocus/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://attractionsmagazine.com/new-book-hocus-pocus-now-available/|title=New book about 'Hocus Pocus' now available|date=September 21, 2016|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924025249/http://attractionsmagazine.com/new-book-hocus-pocus-now-available/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronwallaceonline.com/book/hocus-pocus-book-thinking-fan-disney/|title=Hocus Pocus in Focus: A Hocus Pocus Book for The Thinking Fan|access-date=September 23, 2016|archive-date=September 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925085949/http://www.aaronwallaceonline.com/book/hocus-pocus-book-thinking-fan-disney/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe City of Salem has celebrated its connection to ''Hocus Pocus'', while local filming sites have become an attraction for fans as the film's legacy has grown over the years.
