The film is inspired by a [[Joseon Dynasty]] era [[Fable|folktale]] entitled [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon]], which has been [[Film adaptation|adapted to film]] several times. The plot focuses on a recently released patient from a [[mental institution]] who returns home with her sister, only to face disturbing events between her stepmother and the ghosts haunting their house\u2014all of which are connected to a dark past in the family's history.\n\nThe film opened to very strong commercial and critical reception and won Best Picture at the 2004 [[Fantasporto]] Film Festival.<ref name=\"fantasporto.com\">{{cite web\n |title=Fantas Through Awards \n |url=http://www.fantasporto.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=110 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003183716/http://www.fantasporto.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=110\n |publisher=[[Fantasporto]] \n |archive-date=3 October 2011\n |access-date=27 August 2009 \n |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> It is the highest-grossing South Korean horror film and the first South Korean picture to be screened in American theatres.<ref name=\"media.www.kentnewsnet.com\">http://media.www.kentnewsnet.com/media/storage/paper867/news/2009/02/03/News/the-Uninvited.Stays.True.To.Typical.Korean.Horror.Films-3610298.shtml{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> An English-language [[remake]] titled ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]'' was released in 2009 to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nA teenage girl, Su-mi, is being treated for [[Shock (psychological)|shock]] and [[psychosis]] in a mental institution. She is released and returns home to her family's secluded estate in the countryside with her father and younger sister Su-yeon, whom she is protective of. The sisters have a cold reunion with their stepmother, Eun-joo, who constantly requires [[medication]]. Eun-joo also has a strained relationship with her husband, both of them enduring a [[sexless marriage]].\n\nSu-yeon has a nightmare of her late mother's [[ghost]]. The next day, Su-mi finds family photos which reveal that Eun-joo was formerly an in-home nurse for her then-[[terminally ill]] mother. She discovers bruises on her sister's arms and suspects Eun-joo is responsible. Su-mi confronts Eun-joo about the bruises but Eun-joo refuses to apologize for her actions. That night, their uncle and aunt arrive for dinner, and Eun-joo tells bizarre stories that bewilder them. The aunt suddenly suffers a violent seizure and suffocates. After recovering, she tells her husband that she saw the ghost of a dead girl beneath the kitchen sink during her seizure. Eun-joo tries to see what is beneath the sink, but the ghost girl violently grabs her arm.\n\nEun-joo's relationship with her stepdaughters sours after she finds her pet bird mutilated and killed and her personal photographs defaced. She believes that these actions are somehow connected to the girls and locks Su-yeon in the closet. Su-mi releases her and tells her father about the abuse. Her father begs her to stop acting out and informs her that Su-yeon is dead. Su-mi refuses to believe it as she is sure her sister is right next to her sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nThe next morning, Eun-joo drags a bloodied sack through the house, whipping it. Su-mi believes that Su-yeon is inside the sack. Eun-joo and Su-mi get into a violent physical altercation. Su-mi's father arrives to find an unconscious Su-mi.\n\nIt is ultimately revealed that Su-mi and her father were alone in the house the entire time. Su-mi had suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder]], where she possessed two personalities: herself and a ruder, more distant variation of her stepmom Eun-joo. The \"body\" in the sack that Su-mi was whipping was actually a porcelain doll and she was also the one who killed the pet bird. Su-yeon was also revealed to be long dead; her presence was actually the result of Su-mi's hallucinations.\n\nThe father and the real Eun-joo send Su-mi back to the mental institution. Eun-joo tries to reconcile with Su-mi, promising to visit her as often as she can, but Su-mi rebuffs her. That night, Eun-joo hears footsteps in Su-yeon's old bedroom, revealing that the ghost actually exists. Su-yeon's real ghost crawls out of the closet and kills Eun-joo. Meanwhile, Su-mi smiles, appearing to have finally found peace.\n\nFlashbacks reveal the day that led Su-mi to be institutionalized. While her terminally ill mother was still alive, her father engaged in an [[Adultery|adulterous]] affair with Eun-joo, when she was still their in-home nurse. This upsets the sisters and drives their mother to hang herself in the closet of Su-yeon's bedroom. Su-yeon attempts to revive her but the closet collapses on top of her. Eun-joo sees Su-yeon thrashing and suffocating and at the last minute, decides to save Su-yeon. However, Su-mi arrives and criticises Eun-joo for interfering with her family. Angry at Su-mi's criticisms, Eun-joo leaves Su-yeon to die and tells Su-mi that she'll \"regret this moment.\" Su-mi leaves the house, unaware of both her sister and her mother's fates.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Im Soo-jung (actress)|Im Soo-jung]] as Bae Su-mi\n* [[Moon Geun-young]] as Bae Su-yeon\n* [[Yum Jung-ah]] as Heo Eun-joo\n* [[Kim Kap-soo]] as Bae Moo-hyeon\n* Lee Seung-bi as Mi-hee (Eun-joo's sister in law)\n* [[Lee Dae-yeon]] as Su-mi's doctor\n* Park Mi-hyun as Mrs Bae (Moo-hyeon's first wife and Su-mi's and Su-yeon's mother)\n* Woo Ki-hong as Sun-kyu (Eun-joo's brother)\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2008}}\nThe film is loosely based on a popular Korean fairy tale \"[[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon]]\" which has been adapted into film versions<ref>{{Cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=2003-07-03|title=A Tale of Two Sisters|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/a-tale-of-two-sisters-1200540710/|access-date=2021-02-13|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref> in [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1924 film)|1924]], [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1936 film)|1936]], [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1956 film)|1956]], [[Dae Jang-hwa Hong-ryeon jeon|1962]], [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon (1972 film)|1972]], and [[The Uninvited (2009 film)|2009]].\n\nIn the original Korean folktale, the sisters' names are Janghwa and Hongryeon (Rose Flower and Red Lotus).
