[[William Hurt]], [[Raul Julia]], and [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] star in the leading roles, with supporting roles by [[Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy]], [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]], [[Miriam Pires]], [[Nuno Leal Maia]], [[Fernando Torres (actor)|Fernando Torres]], and [[Herson Capri]].<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407E6D81238F935A15754C0A963948260 New York Times]</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]], where Hurt won the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] award and Babenco was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]], and was released in the United States on July 26, 1985. It received widespread critical acclaim;<ref name=\":0\" /> Hurt won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Actor, and the film received a further three Oscar nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centres on a dialogue between two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]]: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, an effeminate [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in prison for \"corrupting an underage youth.\"\n\nMolina passes the time by recounting memories from one of his favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that is also a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda film]]. He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film-watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two.\n\nAs the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.\n\nWhen Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss.\n\nNow out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina's body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group.\n\nIn the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering [[morphine]] to help him sleep, Valentin appears to succumb to his wounds and perhaps die, when he suddenly finds himself running out of prison with Marta and appearing on an idyllic tropical island with her. Valentin and Marta sail away on a boat into the distance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Hurt]] as Luis Molina<ref name=\"festivalcannes\">[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/932/year/1985.html \u00abKISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN\u00bb]</ref>\n* [[Raul Julia]] as Valentin Arregui\n* [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] as Leni Lamaison/Marta/Spider Woman\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy]] as Warden\n* [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]] as Secret Policeman\n* [[Miriam Pires]] as Molina's mother\n* [[Nuno Leal Maia]] as Gabriel, Molina's friend\n* [[Fernando Torres (actor)|Fernando Torres]] as Am\u00e9rico\n* Patricio Bisso as Greta\n* [[Herson Capri]] as Werner, Leni's German lover and Chief of Counter-Intelligence in movie fantasy\n* [[Denise Dumont]] as Michelle, Leni's best friend in movie fantasy\n* [[Nildo Parente]] as Leader of Resistance in movie fantasy\n* Ant\u00f4nio Petrin as Clubfoot, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n* Wilson Grey as Flunky, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n* [[Miguel Falabella]] as Lieutenant\n* Ana Braga as Lidia, Valentin's girlfriend\n* [[Sergio Kato]] as Martim, Molina's friend\n}}\n\n==Background==\nThe film is based on the 1976 novel ''El beso de la mujer ara\u00f1a'' (''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'') by [[Manuel Puig]]. The Argentinian author was the first to adapt his own novel as a [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (play)|stage play]]. A Broadway musical [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|of the same name]], also based on the novel, was produced in 1993.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nAs noted in Puig's 2001 biography, ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman: His Life and Fictions,'' the novel was banned in Argentina, and the English translation edition preceded a widespread publication in Spanish. The novel was considered for a film adaptation by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and other directors. In 1981, Argentine-born director [[H\u00e9ctor Babenco]] was in Los Angeles, to accept an award from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] for his breakout feature film, ''[[Pixote]]''. At the reception, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] asked Babenco about his future projects, and the director mentioned his desire to adapt Puig's novel, starring [[Burt Lancaster]]. The actor was in attendance at the event, and Thomas introduced him to Babenco.\n\nWhen Lancaster expressed interest, Babenco initially assumed he was disingenuous, but promised to send him a copy of the novel. Several days later, Lancaster's assistant telephoned Babenco to make sure ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' was in the mail, and the director sent it right away. The two met in the coming weeks at the New York Critics\u2019 award ceremony, and Lancaster committed to the role of Molina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/kiss-of-the-spider-woman-william-hurt-125185008702.html|title=William Hurt Looks Back at 'Kiss of the Spider Woman,' the Groundbreaking, Oscar-Winning Drama Turning 30 This Month|date=27 July 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Although Lancaster was attached'','' giving it built in marketability, the novel's untraditional narrative made it a challenge to adapt, and its homosexual theme was perceived as a detriment to attracting widespread audiences. Babenco, who was an expatriate in Brazil at that time, feared a xenophobic backlash against the production for casting American actors. Additional obstacles to the production included Manuel Puig's antagonism toward Babenco; he did not like ''Pixote,'' and suspected the director was an \u201copportunist.\u201d\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBabenco continued to develop the property despite the author's misgivings, and attracted potential investors, including German filmmaker [[Frank Ripploh]]. [[Richard Gere]] was set to play Valentin, giving the production further box-office credibility''.'' New York City socialite [[Jane Holzer]], who appeared in several [[Andy Warhol]] films and was an acquaintance of David Weisman, agreed to finance initial production costs, and [[Leonard Schrader]], who had collaborated with his brother, [[Paul Schrader]], on ''[[The Yakuza]]'', was hired to write the script. However, Babenco remained wary of anglicizing the source material, and was relieved by the casting of Puerto Rican actor [[Raul Julia]], who replaced Richard Gere.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors circulated in the press that Lancaster had a penchant for cross-dressing, and Babenco attempted to dispel the scandal at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] by telling a French gay tabloid that he did not know Lancaster was homosexual when he was cast''.'' Although Babenco intended to imply that Lancaster was not gay, and his sexual orientation had nothing to do with the actor's involvement with the film, his statement was taken out of context when it was published, and prompted further inquisition into Lancaster's personal life. This, along with Lancaster's advancing age, and a heart bypass operation in Apr 1983, caused the production to be delayed, and the filmmakers turned to [[William Hurt]] as a replacement. The morning after Hurt consented to the role, Weisman and Babenco met with independent producer [[Ray Stark]], whose company, Rastar, had been acquired by Columbia Pictures. Stark agreed to take on the project at that time, but neither he nor Columbia are credited onscreen.\n\nThe picture's expected $1.5 million budget was financed in part by Brazil's [[Embrafilme]], which purchased Brazilian distribution rights for $160,000. Below-the-line expenses were raised by Babenco's HB Filmes, and international production services were funded by Weisman's Sugarloaf Films, Inc. The crew was mainly Brazilian, accompanied by several Argentine-born craftsmen''.'' Rehearsals took place in a S\u00e3o Paulo prison that had been vacated in the wake of riots, and sets were constructed at Vera Cruz Studios, which had been abandoned due to bankruptcy.\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe film's setting was relocated from [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], with the added political context of the then-current [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].\n\nThe story features a \"[[Story within a story|film within a film]]\", featuring Luis Molina episodically telling Valentin Arregui the plot of a fictional film called ''Her Real Glory'' ostensibly produced in [[Germany]] during [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[Nazis]].\n\nWhile the book alludes to five motion pictures, the film version focuses on a single Nazi propaganda movie. Puig biographer [[Suzanne Jill Levine]] identified the film as a compilation of various Third Reich productions with the American [[Paris Underground (film)|''Paris Underground'']] and [[The Great Love (1942 film)|''Die gro\u00dfe Liebe'']] ''(The Great Love),'' a 1942 film starring [[Zarah Leander]] as a cabaret singer who falls in love with high-ranking German lieutenant. Leander was the model for the ''Kiss of the Spider Woman\u2019s'' \u201cLeni Lamaison,\u201d who was named after propaganda filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]].\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began October 13, 1983 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]. Since Babenco \"rarely\" spoke English, Hurt took direction from him via an [[assistant director]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> Hurt and Julia had agreed to work for the [[Screen Actors Guild]] pay scale, and deferred the greater portion of their salaries for a profit-share in the sale of the film's distribution rights, as well as its box-office gross. While Babenco and Weisman were also working for the same \u201cdeferred investment plan,\u201d other players, including actress [[S\u00f4nia Braga]], opted to be paid upfront. During filming in Brazil, Hurt and a friend were threatened at gunpoint but were let go several hours later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124043013|title=William Hurt: In Every Role, A New Life To Inhabit|date=25 February 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nThe film received positive reviews.
