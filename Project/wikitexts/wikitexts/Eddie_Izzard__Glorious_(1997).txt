The performance was released on [[VHS]] and covers topics such as the [[Troy|siege of Troy]], [[Noah's Ark]], the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], and the birth of baby [[Jesus]]. In many ways, the flow of topics follow from the [[Bible]], starting with the beginning of time according to the Old Testament and ending with [[Armageddon]] according to the [[Book of Revelation]], though they are covered in Izzard's usual surreal style.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060114160250/http://www.eddieizzard.com/standup/glorious.izz Glorious] - article at The Official Eddie Izzard Site\n*{{IMDb title|id=0195753|title=Eddie Izzard: Glorious}}\n*[http://www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath/ The Cake or Death Site]\n\n[[Category:Eddie Izzard albums]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy albums]]\n[[Category:Spoken word albums by English artists]]\n[[Category:Stand-up comedy concert films]]\n[[Category:1997 live albums]]\n[[Category:1997 video albums]]\n[[Category:Live video albums]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy albums]]\n\n\n{{comedy-album-stub}}"}]}}}}
