It follows a group of researchers who spend a week in the former home of a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] and murderer, where previous paranormal investigators were inexplicably killed. Its screenplay was written by American author [[Richard Matheson]], based upon his 1971 novel ''[[Hell House (novel)|Hell House]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nPhysicist Dr. Lionel Barrett is enlisted by eccentric millionaire Rudolph Deutsch to undertake an investigation on the [[afterlife]] at Belasco House, the \"Mount Everest of haunted houses.\" The house was originally owned by Emeric Belasco, an imposing, perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre occurred at the home. The house is believed to be haunted by the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires.\n\nAccompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two [[Mediumship|medium]]s: mental medium and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]] minister Florence Tanner and physical medium Benjamin Franklin \"Ben\" Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation conducted 20 years before. The group arrive to begin their investigation a week before [[Christmas Eve]], and the rationalist Barrett is rudely skeptical of Florence's belief in \"surviving personalities\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Florence begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Florence may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck.\n\nAnn is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in an apparent trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later after she has become drunk. Her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer. He is resentful, and spurns Fischer's warnings that the house is affecting Ann. Stricken by the accusation, Fischer drops his psychic shields, but he is immediately attacked.\n\nFlorence is convinced that one of the \"surviving personalities\" in the home is Daniel, Belasco's tormented son, and she is determined to prove it at all costs. She finds a human skeleton chained behind a wall. Believing it to be Daniel, Florence and Fischer bury the body outside and Florence performs a funeral. Nevertheless, Daniel's \"personality\" continues to haunt Florence; she is scratched violently by a possessed cat. Barrett suspects that Florence is mutilating herself. In an attempt to put Daniel to rest, Florence gives herself to the entity sexually, but the entity brutalizes her and possesses her body.\n\nBarrett's machine is assembled. Possessed by the [[malevolent spirit]], Florence attempts to destroy it, thinking that it will harm the spirits in the house, but she is prevented from doing serious damage. She enters the chapel, \"the unholy heart\" of the house, in an attempt to warn the spirits, but she is crushed by a falling [[crucifix]]. As she dies, she leaves a symbol written in her own blood. Barrett activates his machine, which seems to be effective. Fischer wanders the house afterwards, attempting to sense psychic energy; in astonishment, he declares the place \"completely clear!\" But violent psychic activity soon resumes, and Barrett is killed.\n\nFischer decides to confront the house, and Ann accompanies him despite her misgivings. Deciphering Florence's dying clue, Fischer deduces that Belasco is the sole entity haunting the house, masquerading as many. He taunts Belasco, declaring him a \"son of a whore\", and that he was no \"roaring giant\", but instead more likely a \"funny little dried-up bastard\" who fooled everyone about his alleged height. Even as objects begin to hurl themselves at Fischer, he continues to defy the entity, and insults Belasco's physical stature. At that, all becomes still. Fischer then concentrates, and a stained-glass partition in the chapel shatters, revealing a hidden door.\n\nFischer and Ann discover a lead-lined room, containing Belasco's preserved body seated in a chair. Pulling out a pocket knife, Fischer rips open Belasco's trouser leg, discovering his final secret: a pair of prosthetic legs. Fischer realises that Belasco had had his own stunted legs amputated, and that he had used the prosthetics with which they were replaced in a grotesque attempt to appear imposing. Belasco also had the specially built room lined with lead, presaging the discovery of the electromagnetic nature of life after death.\n\nWith the room now open, Fischer activates Barrett's machine a second time, and he and Ann leave the house, hoping that Barrett and Florence will guide Belasco to the afterlife without fear.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Pamela Franklin]] as Florence Tanner\n*[[Roddy McDowall]] as Benjamin Franklin Fischer\n*[[Clive Revill]] as Dr. Lionel Barrett\n*[[Gayle Hunnicutt]] an Ann Barrett\n*[[Roland Culver]] as Rudolph Deutsch\n*[[Peter Bowles]] as Hanley\n*[[Michael Gough]] as Emeric Belasco (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction began on 23 October 1972. ''The Legend of Hell House'' is one of only two productions of [[James H. Nicholson]] after his departure from [[American International Pictures]] \u2014 a company he had run, along with [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]], since 1954. Nicholson died of a brain tumour in 10 December 1972, before the film's release on 15 June 1973. Nicholson's company, Academy Pictures Corporation, also released ''[[Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry]]'' through [[Twentieth Century Fox]] on 17 May 1974.\n\nMatheson's screenplay drastically reduced some of the more extreme elements of the novel, particularly its graphic sexuality and [[BDSM]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Legend of Hell House (1973) The Screen: 'Hell House':The Cast|author=A. H.

Mr. Deutsch's mansion in the opening sequence is [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire]]. The interior shot of the long room is the palace's library.\n\nThe role of Belasco was played by an uncredited [[Michael Gough]]. His part consisted of a couple of recorded lines and an on-camera appearance as an embalmed corpse seated upright in a chair.\n\nThe plot of both this film and the book on which it is based, both written by [[Richard Matheson]], have several details in common with [[Shirley Jackson]]\u2019s 1959 novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' (and subsequent 1963 movie adaptation ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'') in which a party of four (some psychic, some skeptical, some British, some Americans) stay in an extremely haunted Gothic mansion house with a terrible history, for the purposes of scientific study, and all are plagued by unseen terrors. It is to both of the films\u2019 credit that they only partially resemble each other.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe film features a score with an [[electronic music]] bassline (with occasional woodwind and brass stabs). The score and electronic sound effects were created by [[Delia Derbyshire]] and [[Brian Hodgson]], recorded at Hodgson's Electrophon studio in London. The soundtrack remains unavailable commercially.\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\nCritical response to ''The Legend of Hell House'' varied. In 1976, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in his review of ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]],'' another movie about a haunted house, that ''\"The Legend of Hell House'' brought out the fun in this sort of material very well.\"<ref>[[Roger Ebert]], \"[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19761008/REVIEWS/610080301 Burnt Offerings],\" ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', 8 October 1976, URL accessed 4 February 2013.</ref> In his ''2002 Movie & Video Guide'', [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film three of four stars and called it \"Not the usual ghost story, and certain to curl a few hairs.\"<ref>[[Leonard Maltin]], ed., ''Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie & Video Guide.''

The DVD included the theatrical trailer as a special feature.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, the [[Shout! Factory]] label Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray. The release included a 30-minute interview with director John Hough, a commentary track by actress Pamela Franklin, stills gallery, original theatrical trailer, radio ads and reversible cover art featuring the theatrical artwork and customized artwork for the Blu-ray release.\n\n==Related works==\n\nMatheson's screenplay was published in the 1997 collection ''Screamplays''<ref>{{cite book|last=Chizmar|first=Richard|title=Screamplays|publisher=Del Rey|year=1997|isbn=0345394291}}</ref> and again in 2000 as a stand alone text.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matheson|first=Richard|title=The Legend of Hell House: The Screenplay|publisher=Harvest Moon Publishing|year=2000|isbn=1929750021}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n* Dialogue from the film has been [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] in popular songs by the bands [[Anaal Nathrakh]] and [[Skinny Puppy]], and in [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]]'s \"I Don't Know You People\" from their 1999 album ''[[The Middle of Nowhere (Orbital album)|The Middle of Nowhere]].''<ref>Orbital.
