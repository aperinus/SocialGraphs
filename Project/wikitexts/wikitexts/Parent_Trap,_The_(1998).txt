It is a [[remake]] of the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|1961 film of the same name]] and an adaptation of [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]'s 1949 German novel ''[[Lisa and Lottie]]'' (''Das doppelte Lottchen'').\n\n[[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]] star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; [[Lindsay Lohan]] stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on ''Lottie and Lisa''. Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n''The Parent Trap'' was theatrically released in the United States on July 29, 1998 and was a box-office hit, grossing $92.1 million against a $15 million budget. It received positive reviews from critics, with Lohan's performance in particular earning high praise.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1986, Nick Parker and Elizabeth James meet on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', fall in love and get married. Soon, they give birth to twins named Hallie and Annie. Shortly after the twins' birth, Nick and Elizabeth divorce with Nick being given custody over Hallie and raising her in California where he owns his own vineyard. Meanwhile, Elizabeth raises Annie in London where she works as a wedding gown designer.\n\n11 years and 9 months later in the year 1998, the twins are coincidentally sent to the same summer camp where they form an intense rivalry. When Hallie and her friends perform a dangerous prank on Annie's cabin, Hallie and Annie are sent to the isolation cabin where they begin to bond over some of their common interests. When they realize each has a divorced parent, they show one another a photograph of the parents with whom they have never met and discover they are twins who were separated at birth. They decide to switch places to get their parents to meet again and get back together; each girl trains the other to be like her.\n\nIn London, Hallie happily meets Elizabeth, the family butler Martin and her maternal grandfather. She learns that Elizabeth and Nick met on a cruise line and fell in love. Meanwhile, in California, Annie meets Nick and their family nanny, Chessy. Much to her dismay, she learns that Nick has fallen in love with a young woman named Meredith Blake who only has an interest in Nick's fortune. Annie phones Hallie and attempts to persuade her to bring their mother to California to try and break up Nick and Meredith but Hallie refuses.\n\nChessy, meanwhile, has noticed that \"Hallie\" has changed a lot; Annie reveals her identity, but Chessy keeps this a secret. Nick informs Annie that he is marrying Meredith, much to Annie's dismay. In a phone conversation, Annie informs Hallie of the upcoming wedding between Nick and Meredith. However, Hallie is discovered by her grandfather, who forces her to tell her mother that she is in fact Hallie, not Annie. Elizabeth and Hallie decide that they need to travel to California to agree on joint custody of the twins between each parent.\n\nAnnie and Hallie both arrange with Martin and Chessy for a meeting between Nick and Elizabeth at the Stafford Hotel in California, although only Elizabeth is aware of this. Elizabeth and Nick are reunited and Nick happily realizes that he has had Annie with him since the camp. Elizabeth also meets Meredith and learns that she and Nick will be getting married. Annie and Hallie attempt to recreate the night where their parents met by arranging dinner on a yacht. Nick and Elizabeth agree that Hallie will go to London over Christmas and Annie will spend Easter in California, but decide against resuming their relationship, with Elizabeth planning to fly back to London with Annie the next day. However, the twins refuse to reveal which one is which unless the four of them go on a camping trip together. Elizabeth insists that Meredith go in her place, wanting her to get to know the girls before she marries Nick.\n\nThe girls play a series of pranks on Meredith, including putting a lizard on her head and filling her insect repellant with sugar and water. When the girls place her mattress on a lake, Meredith is furious and vows to get rid of them, demanding that Nick chooses between her and them. Finally seeing Meredith's true nature, Nick chooses the girls over her, causing dismayed Meredith to break off the engagement and call off the wedding. On returning home, Nick is somewhat relieved to be free of Meredith. He shows Elizabeth his wine collection which includes wine they drank at their wedding. The two realize they are still in love, but decide to go their separate ways with the twin they have custody of.\n\nElizabeth and Annie arrive back in London. They are stunned to find Nick and Hallie, who flew to London via [[Concorde]]. Nick reveals he feels bad about not going after Elizabeth the first time. The two finally kiss, signifying their intention to resume their marriage. The end credits show photographs from their wedding which also takes place on the QE2 with Hallie and Annie as bridesmaids and Chessy and Martin getting engaged.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Hallie Parker and Annie James, eleven-year-old twin sisters who were separated after birth. Following their parents' divorce, they were raised separately with no knowledge of each other's existence \u2014 until they meet at [[summer camp]] by chance.

She has long considered herself rather awkward and thus not overly desirable to eligible bachelors, but then she meets Martin, and the two are mutually smitten. She also discovers that \"Hallie\" is actually Annie after noticing her strange behavior.\n* [[Simon Kunz]] as Martin, the James family's butler, who falls in love with Chessy.\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Marva Kulp Sr., the owner and director of Camp Walden.\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Marva Kulp Jr., Marva Sr.'s daughter and assistant.\n* [[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Charles James, Elizabeth's wealthy father and Annie and Hallie's maternal grandfather.

Patrick McCormack as Les Blake, Meredith's father.\n\n[[Kat Graham]] played Jackie, a friend of Annie at Camp Walden. [[Vendela Kirsebom]] appears as a model during a photoshoot sequence at Elizabeth James' studio. Meyers and Shyer's daughters [[Hallie Meyers-Shyer]] and Annie Meyers-Shyer make appearances in the film, credited as Lindsay and Towel Girl, respectively.

Lohan's mother, [[Dina Lohan|Dina]], and other siblings [[Aliana Lohan|Aliana]] and Cody, all appear in uncredited [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] at the airport in London. The film's cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]] appears in an uncredited cameo as the captain of the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', who marries Nick and Elizabeth at the beginning of the film. [[Jeannette Charles]] portrayed [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in a deleted scene in which she and Hallie meet.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Casting ===\nMore than 1,500 young actresses submitted audition tapes for the dual roles of Hallie and Annie.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lauren |date=2004 |title=Lindsay Lohan: The \"It\" Girl Next Door|publisher= Simon and Schuster|page=15 |isbn= 9780689878886}}</ref> Director Nancy Meyers was looking for \"a little Diane Keaton\" to play the parts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsay Lohan, Rehab and Oscar|date=28 May 2007|url=https://www.newsweek.com/lindsay-lohan-rehab-and-oscar-101507|publisher=Newsweek|access-date=June 15, 2020}}</ref> Before Lohan was cast in the roles, actresses [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Mara Wilson]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], and [[Jena Malone]] all either auditioned or were considered for the roles, with Malone turning the roles down multiple times.<ref>{{cite web|title=20 Things You Never Knew About The Parent Trap|date=29 July 2018|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/950749/20-things-you-never-knew-about-the-parent-trap|publisher=E Online|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] started on July 15, 1997, in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], and continued in [[Napa Valley AVA]], [[San Francisco]], [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]], and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to December 17, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Parent Trap - Production Notes - About the locations|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=245|publisher=CinemaReview.com|access-date=December 31, 2021|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006035124/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=245|archive-date=October 6, 2018}}</ref> Camp Walden was filmed on location at Camp Seely in [[Crestline, California]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parent Trap, The (film, 1998)|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/parent-trap-film-1998/|publisher=D23|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> Parker Knoll, the vineyard and residence of the Parker family in the film, was shot on location in [[Rutherford, California]] at Staglin Family Vineyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Staglin Family Vineyard - The Napa Wine Project|url=http://www.napawineproject.com/staglin-family-vineyard/|publisher=The Napa Wine Project|access-date=June 13, 2020}}</ref> The exterior of the fictional Stafford Hotel was shot at [[The Langham Huntington, Pasadena|The Langham Huntington]] in [[Pasadena, California]] and the [[Administration Building, Treasure Island]] in San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/George-Lucas-Indiana-Jones-Nazi-flags-Treasure-Isl-14462515.php|title=How Treasure Island found its way into the most iconic Indiana Jones film |publisher=[[SFGate.com]] |author=Grant Marek |date=September 26, 2019 |accessdate=November 10, 2021}}</ref> while the interior and pool scenes were shot at the Ritz Carlton in [[Marina Del Rey, California]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Luxurious, Wonderfully Dated Hotels From TV and Movies|date=24 March 2014|url=https://www.curbed.com/2014/3/24/10134794/luxurious-wonderfully-dated-hotels-from-tv-and-movies|publisher=Curbed|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Connections to the 1961 film ==\nThere are several connections between this film and the original 1961 version:\n* The characters Marva Kulp Sr. and Marva Kulp Jr. are named after [[Nancy Kulp]], the actress who played a camp counsellor in the 1961 film, Miss Grunecker.\n* Both versions of the film feature product placement by [[Nabisco]]. In the 1998 film, [[Oreo]]s are featured, while in the 1961 film, [[Newtons (cookie)|Fig Newtons]] are featured.\n* During the poolside scene where Annie and Meredith meet for the first time, Meredith speaks on the phone with someone named Reverend Mosby, who was a character in the 1961 film played by [[Leo G. Carroll]].\n* Joanna Barnes appears in both films, playing Vicky Robinson in the 1961 film, and Vicki Blake in the 1998 version. \n* The Stafford Hotel is named after a boy in the 1961 film that accepts the boy's camp invitation to the dance at the beginning of the film.\n* Right before Hallie meets Meredith for the first time, she can be heard singing a few bars of \"[[Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song)|Let's Get Together]]\", a song from the 1961 version originally sung by Hayley Mills.\n* There are bunk houses named Arapahoe in both films.\n* Hallie (as Annie) \"smells\" her grandfather, saying he smells of peppermint and pipe tobacco. Susan (as Sharon) does the same in the 1961 film.\n\n== Music ==\nThe song used in the opening sequence in which glimpses of Nick and Elizabeth's first wedding are seen is [[Nat King Cole]]'s \"[[L-O-V-E]]\". The song used in the end credits, in which photos of Nick and Elizabeth's second wedding are seen, is his daughter [[Natalie Cole]]'s \"[[This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)]]\".\n\nThe instrumental music featured prominently in the hotel scene where the girls and their parents cross paths serendipitously is \"[[In the Mood]]\", which was previously made famous by the [[Glenn Miller]] band. The song \"Let's Get Together\" is also quoted over the Walt Disney Pictures logo, and at the end of [[Alan Silvestri]]'s closing credits suite.\n\nWhen Hallie shows up at Annie's poker game at Camp Walden, the music used is \"[[Bad to the Bone]]\" by [[George Thorogood]] and the Destroyers.\n\nThe tune playing as Hallie and Annie are making their way up to the Isolation Cabin is the main theme from \"[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]\" by Elmer Bernstein.\n\nThe song coming from the radio in Meredith's car as she pulls up to the Parker's home is \"[[Parents Just Don't Understand]]\" by [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].\n\nThe background song heard in the campfire scene is \"[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]\" by the music group [[OMC (band)|OMC]].\n\nThe song playing as Annie, Elizabeth, and Martin say goodbye to Hallie, Nick and Chessy toward the end of the film is \"[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]\", performed by [[Ray Charles]] & [[Betty Carter]].\n<!-- See [[Template:Tracklist]] if you want to improve this section -->\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Parent Trap\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| cover      = File:TheParentTrapAlbumCover.jpg\n| alt        = Cover art of the film's soundtrack, depicting Lindsay Lohan as the twins and Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson as their parents.\n| artist     = Various artists\n| released   = July 28, 1998\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 54:08\n| label      = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = \n| headline  = ''The Parent Trap'' (Original Soundtrack)\n|extra_column= Recording artist\n| total_length =  54:08\n\n| title1    = [[L-O-V-E]]\n| writer1   = Bert Kaempfert; Milt Gabler\n|extra1= [[Nat King Cole]]\n| length1   = 2:32\n\n| title2    = [[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]\n| writer2   = John Sebastian\n|extra2= [[The Lovin' Spoonful]]\n| length2   = 2:05\n\n| title3    = [[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]  \n| writer3   =Lee Mavers\n|extra3= [[The La's]]\n| length3   = 2:43\n\n| title4    = [[Top of the World (The Carpenters song)|Top of the World]] \n| writer4   = Fred Busby; John Bettis\n|extra4= [[Shonen Knife]]\n| length4   = 3:56\n\n| title5    =  [[Here Comes the Sun]] \n| writer5   = George Harrison\n|extra5= [[Bronx Style Bob|Bob Khaleel]]\n| length5   =  3:08\n\n| title6    = [[(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons]]  \n| writer6   = Deek Watson; William Best\n|extra6= [[Linda Ronstadt]]\n| length6   = 3:44\n\n| title7    = [[Am I the Same Girl|Soulful Strut]]\n| writer7   = Eugene Record; Sonny Sanders\n|extra7= [[Young-Holt Unlimited]]  \n| length7   = 3:00\n\n| title8    = Never Let You Go\n| writer8   =Christian Berman; Frank Berman; Gabriel Gilbert; Jeff Coplan; Matthias Hass; Nick Laird-Clowes\n|extra8= [[Jakaranda]]\n| length8   = 3:07\n\n| title9    = [[Bad to the Bone]]\n| writer9   = [[George Thorogood]]\n|extra9= [[George Thorogood & The Destroyers]]\n| length9   = 4:49\n\n| title10   = [[The Happy Club]] \n| writer10  =[[Bob Geldof]]; [[Karl Wallinger]]\n|extra10= Bob Geldof\n| length10  = 4:05\n\n| title11   =  Suite from ''The Parent Trap'' \n| writer11  = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n|extra11= \n| length11  = 7:13\n\n| title12   = [[This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)]] \n| writer12  = Chuck Jackson; Marvin Yancy\n|extra12= [[Natalie Cole]]\n| length12  = 2:49\n\n| title13   = Dream Come True{{ref|a}}\n| writer13  = Milton Davis\n|extra13= Ta-Gana\n| length13  = 3:50\n\n| title14   = [[Groovin'|Groovin{{'-}}]]{{ref|a}}\n| writer14  = Eddie Brigati; Felix Cavaliere\n|extra14= [[Pato Banton]] & The Reggae Revolution\n| length14  = 3:50\n\n| title15   = Let's Get Together{{ref|a}}\n| writer15  = Richard M.
