Jackson]]. ''Sphere'' is based on the [[Sphere (novel)|1987 novel of the same name]] by [[Michael Crichton]]. The film was released in the United States on February 13, 1998.\n\n== Plot ==\nA spacecraft, presumed to be of alien origin, is discovered on the floor of the [[Pacific Ocean]], estimated to have been there for nearly 300 years. A team of experts, including marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin, mathematician Dr. Harry Adams, astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding, psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman, and [[U.S. Navy]] Captain Harold Barnes, are assembled and taken to the Habitat, a state-of-the-art underwater living environment located near the spacecraft.\n\nUpon examination of the spacecraft, they are perplexed to learn it is not alien at all, but rather American in origin. However, its technology far surpasses any in the present day. The ship's computer logs cryptically suggest a mission that originated either in the distant past or future, but the team manages to deduce that the long dead crew were tasked with collecting an item of scientific importance. Norman and Beth discover the ship's logs, with the last entry noting an \"unknown event.\" A holographic re-enactment of the event reveals that hundreds of years in the future the ship encountered a [[black hole]], which apparently led to the ship crash landing in the ocean, back in the 1700s. Soon after, Norman and the others eventually stumble upon a large, yet perfect sphere hovering in the cargo bay. They cannot find any way to probe the inside of the sphere, as the fluid surface seems to be impenetrable. Upon observation, Norman ominously notes the sphere reflects everything in the room except them.\n\nOnce they return to the Habitat, Harry hypothesizes that everyone on this team is fated to die. Harry notes that the black hole is referred to as an \"unknown event\" in the future logs. However, here in the present they have knowledge of the historic event, yet it's unable to be explained later on. During the night, Harry returns to the spacecraft and is able to enter the sphere. Norman follows after Harry, where he finds him unconscious next to the sphere and returns him to the Habitat. The next day, the crew discovers a series of numeric-encoded messages appearing on the computer screens; the crew is able to decipher them and comes to believe they are speaking to \"Jerry\", an alien intelligence from the sphere. They find Jerry is able to see and hear everything that happens on the Habitat.\n\nA powerful [[typhoon]] strikes the surface, and the Habitat crew is forced to stay in the Habitat several more days. During that time, a series of tragedies strikes the crew, including attacks from aggressive [[jellyfish]] and a [[giant squid]], and equipment failures in the base, which kill Ted and the team's support staff. The survivors, Beth, Harry, and Norman, believe Jerry is responsible. Norman discovers that they had misinterpreted the initial messages from Jerry, and that the entity speaking to them through the computers is actually Harry himself, transmitted from his mind while he is asleep. Norman and Beth eventually realize that when Harry entered the sphere, he gained the ability to make anything he imagines a reality and conclude that all the horrors that have befallen the Habitat were manifestations of Harry's fears.\n\nNorman and Beth sedate Harry with enough sleeping drugs to put him into a dreamless sleep to prevent him from doing any further damage. When Norman is attacked by a snake, however, Beth realizes that Harry alone could not have been responsible for everything that had happened on the Habitat and confronts Norman, accusing him of entering the sphere when he went to retrieve Harry. Beth's suspicions prove to be correct, but after experiencing her own nightmarish vision, she confesses to Norman that she too entered the sphere. Upon being rejoined by Harry, the three of them realize that the crew of the ship must have also entered the sphere and ended up killing each other after being driven mad by their fears. Under the stress of the situation, Beth has suicidal thoughts which causes the detonation mechanisms on a store of explosives to engage, threatening to destroy the base and the spacecraft. They race to the Habitat's mini-sub, but their combined fears cause them to re-appear back in the spacecraft. As a psychologist, Norman is able to see through the illusion.  He triggers the mini-sub's undocking process and overrides the others' fears that they will not escape the destruction of the Habitat and spacecraft. The sphere is untouched by the explosions.\n\nThe mini-sub makes it to the surface as the surface ships return. As Beth, Harry, and Norman begin safe [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]], they realize that they will be debriefed and their newfound powers discovered. They agree to erase their memories of the event using their powers, ensuring the \"unknown event\" paradox is resolved. The sphere rises from the ocean and then accelerates off into space.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Dr. Norman Goodman\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Dr. Elizabeth \"Beth\" Halperin\n* [[Samuel L.

That he is officially Jewish? What does that have to do with the movie? Do we need to know the math of [[Mel Gibson]] or [[Tom Cruise]]? Why would an actor in a sci-fi film be singled out as Jewish? For days it troubled me. Negative reviews are part of filmmaking, but what did this comment mean? Suddenly, I remembered my childhood impression that everyone in the world was Jewish, and the subsequent realization: Not only wasn't the world Jewish, but 99 percent of the world wasn't! And that led to memories of a time when Jews were denied access to a swim club, and not allowed to live in certain parts of Baltimore, just as blacks were excluded. School integration didn't happen until 1954. Finally, there was a reason to revisit Baltimore once again, not to indulge nostalgia, but to examine race, religion and class distinction. With the story of the friendship between a Jewish boy and a black girl who find themselves classmates in a newly integrated high school, I wanted to examine not the anger among Baltimore's different populations but the lack of understanding -- because with misunderstanding comes humor, humor from character.\".<ref name=heights/><ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 1999|title=Barry Levinson: Baltimore, My Baltimore|last=Levinson|first=Barry|author-link=Barry Levinson|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/111499levinson-film.html}}</ref>}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Extraterrestrial life]]\n* [[Grandfather paradox]]\n* [[Predestination paradox]]\n* [[Time travel]]\n* [[Time travel paradox]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/sphere}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{AllMusic|album|mw0000033372|''Sphere {{bracket|Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}''}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{tcmdb title|443957|Sphere}}\n\n{{Barry Levinson}}\n{{Goldenthal, Elliot}}\n{{Michael Crichton}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Barry Levinson]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Michael Crichton]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elliot Goldenthal]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Attanasio]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Kurt Wimmer]]\n[[Category:Metaphysical fiction films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction submarine films]]\n[[Category:Underwater action films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
