Longyear]]'s [[Enemy Mine (novella)|novella of the same name]]. The film stars [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as a human and alien soldier, respectively, who become stranded together on an inhospitable planet and must overcome their mutual distrust in order to cooperate and survive.\n\nAn international co-production between the United States, United Kingdom and West Germany, ''Enemy Mine'' began production in [[Budapest]] in April 1984 under the direction of [[Richard Loncraine]], who quickly ran into \"creative differences\" with producer [[Stephen J. Friedman (producer)|Stephen Friedman]] and executives at [[20th Century Fox]]; the project was shut down after a week of shooting. Petersen then took over as director and reshot Loncraine's scenes after moving the production to [[Munich]].\n\nOriginally budgeted at $17 million, the film ultimately cost more than $40&nbsp;million after marketing costs were factored in, and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]] during the 1985 holiday season, earning only a little over $12&nbsp;million. However, the film was successful in the former [[Soviet Union]], where it became the first Western sci-fi film shown in the theaters. It later gained a [[Cult film|cult]] following.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the late 21st century, an [[Interstellar medium|interstellar]] war between humans (associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA) and [[Dracs]] (bipedal reptilian humanoids) is fought. Battles are periodically fought between fighter spacecraft, and no human hates the Dracs more than Willis E. Davidge. During one such battle, Davidge and Drac pilot Jareeba Sheegan engage in a [[dogfight]], which results in them both crash-landing on Fyrine&nbsp;IV, a planet whose surface is largely a hostile volcanic wasteland. After initial hostilities where they viciously hunt one another, the two learn to cooperate to survive. Over the next three years they become friends, each saving the other's life several times.\n\nDavidge, haunted by dreams of spaceships landing on the planet, leaves in search of help. He finds evidence of humans, but learns that the planet has only periodically been visited by human miners known as Scavengers who use Dracs as slave labor. He returns to warn Jareeba, nicknamed \"Jerry\", only to discover that Jerry is now pregnant; Dracs reproduce through [[Autogamy|self-fertilization]].\n\nTo pass the time, Davidge and Jerry memorize each other's ancestry, agreeing that Davidge's lineage is \"very thin\". Jerry later dies in childbirth, but not before making Davidge swear to take the child, Zammis, back to the Drac homeworld and recite the Jareeba lineage so the child can join Drac society. Davidge raises Zammis, who calls him \"Uncle\".\n\nOne day a ship flies overhead and Davidge goes to investigate. Zammis is curious and follows. He is discovered by a pair of Scavengers. Davidge attacks the men, killing one of them, but Zammis inadvertently stands between Davidge and the other miner and Davidge is gunned down. Later, a BTA patrol ship finds Davidge, apparently dead, and returns him to his base space station.\n\nDuring an impersonal funeral ceremony, Davidge suddenly awakens, speaking Drac in his confused state. He is later reinstated to duty, but not as a pilot, as his superiors want to make sure he has not defected to the Dracs. Unable to get help in rescuing Zammis, Davidge steals a fighter ship to find the child on his own. He manages to find the Scavenger ship and sneaks aboard. Davidge speaks to the Drac slaves in their own language; they know about Zammis and realize he is Uncle. Davidge enters the facility, fighting one miner after another, and the slaves revolt. Towards the end of the battle, they are assisted by the BTA crew who pursued the stolen ship. Davidge fights and is nearly killed by the same Scavenger that first shot him but is saved when one of the Drac slaves shoots the Scavenger. Davidge and Zammis are reunited and return to the Drac homeworld with the freed Dracs.\n\nIn the [[epilogue]], Davidge and Zammis are on the Drac homeworld as Davidge recites the Jareeba family line before the Drac council, fulfilling his promise to \"Jerry\": \"...{{nbsp}}and when, in the fullness of time, Zammis brought its own child before the Holy Council, the name of 'Willis Davidge' was added to the line of Jareeba.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Willis \"Will\" Davidge (called \"Dah-witch\" by Jareeba)\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Jareeba Sheegan (called \"Jerry\" by Davidge)\n* [[Brion James]] as Stubbs, the Scavenger leader\n* [[Richard Marcus]] as Arnold, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Morse, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Bumper Robinson]] as Zammis\n* Jim Mapp as Old Drac Slave\n* [[Lance Kerwin]] as Joey Wooster, Davidge's copilot\n* Scott Kraft as Jonathan, a Scavenger\n* Lou Michaels as Wilson, a Scavenger\n* Andy Geer as Bates, a Scavenger\n* Henry Stolow as Cates, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Herb Andress]] as Hopper, Davidge's superior officer\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Stanley O'Toole, Dennis Quaid, Wolfgang Petersen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(from left) producer [[Stanley O'Toole]], [[Dennis Quaid]], director [[Wolfgang Petersen]] while filming ''Enemy Mine'' in 1984]]\n\nThe novella was published in 1979 and won a Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1980.<ref>Hugo Awards Announced\nThe Washington Post 1 Sep 1980: C6.</ref>\n\n=== Richard Loncraine ===\nThe film began shooting in April 1984 with [[Richard Loncraine]] (''[[Brimstone & Treacle]]'') as director and a budget of $18&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"LAT120785\">Roderick Mann, [https://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-07/entertainment/ca-14268_1 A Gentleman And A Drac], ''Los Angeles Times'', December 7, 1985, Accessed December 23, 2010.</ref> However, after three weeks of shooting in [[Iceland]] and [[Budapest]], producers became concerned about a mixture of budget overruns, creative differences and poor quality [[dailies]].\n\n\"It looked like the planet Earth,\" said one executive close to the production. \"It was costing millions of dollars to create a different look and both the location and Lou Gossett's costume made it look like a cheap '50s horror movie.\"<ref name=\"globe\">WOLFGANG PETERSEN; THE CREATOR OF 'DAS BOOT' VENTURES INTO OUTER SPACE: Blowen, Michael.

The studio had faith in the story and actors involved, and asked Wolfgang Petersen to take over.<ref name=\"LAT123085\" />\n\n\"They made it sound as if they were having a bad dream,\" said Petersen. \"I explained that I'm not the kind of director who can jump on a plane and finish someone else's work.\"<ref name=\"globe\" />\n\nHowever Petersen changed his mind when he read the script. \"I'm not a fan of ''[[Star Wars]]'' science fiction,\" said Petersen. \"I thought I would hate ''Enemy Mine'', but after reading the script I realized that there was more going on than just a shoot-'em-up in outer space. I really was very much impressed with the script but I had too much to do.

Brothers because they dared to be.\"<ref name=\"LAT123085\"/>\n\nThe studio pushed the film with a full [[Blitz Campaign|marketing blitz]] the Sunday before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with full-page advertisements in 43 of the largest newspapers in the United States. Meanwhile, Fox arranged for a television \"network roadblock\": virtually simultaneous 30-second [[prime time]] commercials on [[Television network#History|all three]].

That did not occur, with the film pulling in only $1.6&nbsp;million at 703 theaters nationwide. As of [[Christmas]] day, the film had taken in $2.3&nbsp;million at the box office.
