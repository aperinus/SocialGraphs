The band released a [[#Soundtrack album|soundtrack album]]. [[Louise Lasser]], who was married to Allen at the time, served as one of the voice actors for the \"new\" dialogue soundtrack, as did [[Mickey Rose]], Allen's writing partner on ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' (1969) and ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"isptsreggsalad\" /> In 2003, Image released the film on DVD, with both the theatrical and television (called \"alternate\") soundtracks.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot provides the setup for a string of [[Visual gag|sight gags]], [[pun]]s, jokes based on Asian [[stereotype]]s, and general [[farce]]. The central plot involves the misadventures of secret agent Phil Moskowitz, hired by the Grand Exalted High Macha of Rashpur (\"a nonexistent but real-sounding country\") to recover a secret egg salad recipe that was stolen from him. The recipe, in the possession of gangster Shepherd Wong, is also being sought by rival gangster Wing Fat, and Moskowitz, assisted by two female Rashpur agents, temporarily teams up with Wing Fat to steal the recipe from Wong.\n\nThe movie has an ending credits scene unrelated to the plot, in which [[China Lee]], a [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] and wife of Allen's comic idol [[Mort Sahl]] who does not appear elsewhere in the film, does a striptease while Allen (who is also on-screen) explains that he promised he would put her in the film somewhere.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tatsuya Mihashi]] as Phil Moscowitz, a secret agent and self-described \"lovable rogue\" (other people call him \"amiable zany\")\n* [[Akiko Wakabayashi]] as Suki Yaki, a beautiful woman who has escaped from prison; she seduces Phil and later works alongside him as a spy\n* [[Mie Hama]] as Teri Yaki, Suki's sister who helps Phil as well (cf.

Some guy called me and said he bought a Japanese film and would I dub it with comic American? I don't count that as anything. I was even going to sue to keep that from coming out because I thought it was such junk. It was successful so my manager at the time said, 'Shut up and go with the flow and don't make a fuss.'\"</ref>\n\nIt has been noted that it is not Allen's voice we hear at the end of the movie.  In an interview with Brett Homenick, S.
