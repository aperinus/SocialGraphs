The film is an intimate, interpretive performance of the 1899 play ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' by [[Anton Chekhov]] as adapted by [[David Mamet]].<ref name=\"Criterion Collection\"/>\n\n==Premise==\nActors in New York City rehearse ''Uncle Vanya'' in a dilapidated theatre.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Vanya\n*[[Julianne Moore]] as Yelena\n*[[Larry Pine]] as Dr. Astrov\n*[[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Sonya\n*[[George Gaynes]] as Prof. Serebryakov\n*[[Phoebe Brand]] as Marina/Nanny\n*Jerry Mayer as Telegin/Waffles\n*[[Lynn Cohen]] as Vonenskaya/Maman\n}}\nThe film also features [[Madhur Jaffrey]] and [[Andre Gregory]] as himself. Shawn, Gregory, and Malle had previously collaborated on the 1981 film ''[[My Dinner with Andre]].'' Several actors known to the New York stage are featured, including [[George Gaynes]], [[Larry Pine]], [[Phoebe Brand]], [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]], and [[Lynn Cohen]].\n\nMoore, whose film career was gaining critical attention because of her performance in ''[[Short Cuts]]'', was prominently featured in the advertising campaign for the film.\n\nThe soundtrack features music by the Joshua Redman Quartet, with Redman on tenor saxophone, Brad Mehldau on piano, Christian McBride on bass, and Brian Blade on drums.\n\n==Production==\nOver the course of three years, director [[Andre Gregory]] and a group of actors came together on a voluntary basis in order to better understand Chekhov's work through performance workshops.  Staged and filmed entirely within the vacant shell of the then-abandoned [[New Amsterdam Theater]] on 42nd Street in [[New York City]], they enacted the play rehearsal-style on a bare stage with the actors in street clothes. Free from any commercial demands, their performances were for an invited audience only. Gregory and director [[Louis Malle]] decided to document the play as they had developed it. The film was the result of the collaborative process. It was the last film of Malle's career.\n\n===Filming===\nWorkshop rehearsals with Gregory and the cast originally took place at the abandoned [[New Victory Theater|Victory Theater]] on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] in New York City. The filmed version was shot entirely within the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], also on 42nd Street. Built in 1903, the theatre was the original home of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', a historical tidbit mentioned in the film during some pre-show banter. In the late 1930s, the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] was transformed into a movie palace. The theatre remained a movie palace until it \"temporarily\" closed in 1982.\n\nAt the time ''Vanya on 42nd Street'' was filmed, the theatre had been abandoned for over ten years and was in a state of severe disrepair. Rats had chewed through much of the [[stage rigging]], and flooding and mice made the stage unusable, so that they were restricted to a section of what had been the orchestra.<ref name=\"Criterion Collection\"/>\n\nFor the film production, some rows of seats were removed and a small platform was built for the cast and film crew. Shortly after the production of ''Vanya'', the New Amsterdam was leased to [[The Walt Disney Company]].  Disney restored the theatre to its grand original design and reopened it in 1997.\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\n''Vanya on 42nd Street'' received mostly positive reviews from critics.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vanya_on_42nd_street/#contentReviews Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. \"As he did with ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]''\", Ebert wrote, \"[Malle shows] he is the master of a visual style suited to tightly-encompassed material. There is not a shot that calls attention to itself, and yet not a shot that is without thought.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=December 23, 1994|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/vanya-on-42nd-street-1994|title=Vanya On 42nd Street Movie Review (1994)|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n=== Year-end lists ===\n* 1st&nbsp;\u2013 Peter Rainer, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref name = \"LATimesYE\"/>\n* 2nd&nbsp;\u2013 [[Stephen Hunter]], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Stephen|date=December 25, 1994|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-12-25-1994359091-story.html|title=Films worthy of the title 'best' in short supply MOVIES|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>\n* 2nd&nbsp;\u2013 Michael Mills, ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Michael|date=December 30, 1994|title=It's a Fact: 'Pulp Fiction' Year's Best|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|page=7|edition=Final}}</ref>\n* 3rd&nbsp;\u2013 Bob Strauss, ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Bob|date=December 30, 1994|title=At the Movies: Quantity Over Quality|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|page=L6|edition=Valley}}</ref>\n* 5th&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]], ''Los Angeles Times''<ref name = \"LATimesYE\"/>\n* 5th&nbsp;\u2013 David Elliott, ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=David|date=December 25, 1994|title=On the big screen, color it a satisfying time|newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|edition=1, 2|page=E=8}}</ref>\n* 7th&nbsp;\u2013 [[Gene Siskel]], ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Siskel|first=Gene|date=December 25, 1994|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-12-25-9412250050-story.html|title=The Year's Best Movies|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref>\n* 9th&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kenneth Turan]], ''Los Angeles Times''<ref name = \"LATimesYE\">{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=December 25, 1994|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-12-25-ca-12998-story.html|title=1994: YEAR IN REVIEW : No Weddings, No Lions, No Gumps |work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref>\n* 9th&nbsp;\u2013 Robert Denerstein, ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Denerstein|first=Robert|date=January 1, 1995|title=Perhaps It Was Best to Simply Fade to Black|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|page=61A|edition=Final}}</ref>\n* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Mike Clark, ''[[USA Today]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Mike|date=December 28, 1994 |title=Scoring with true life, 'True Lies' and 'Fiction.'|newspaper=USA Today|page=5D|edition=Final}}</ref>\n* Top 10 (not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Betsy Pickle, ''[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Pickle|first=Betsy|date=December 30, 1994|title=Searching for the Top 10...
