With a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and directed by [[George Cukor]], the film depicts a poor [[Cockney]] flower-seller named [[Eliza Doolittle]] who overhears an arrogant phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, as he casually wagers that he could teach her to speak \"proper\" English, thereby making her presentable in the high society of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] [[London]].\n\nThe film stars [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Eliza Doolittle and [[Rex Harrison]] as Henry Higgins, with [[Stanley Holloway]], [[Gladys Cooper]] and [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] in supporting roles. A critical and commercial success, it became [[1964 in film|the second highest-grossing film of 1964]] and won eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=\"NY Times\" /> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] named it the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|91st greatest American film of all time]]. In 2006 it was ranked eighth in the [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] list.\n\nIn 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of [[phonetics]], believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\"Why Can't the English?\"). At the [[Covent Garden]] fruit-and-vegetable market one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach even Eliza Doolittle, the young flower seller woman with a strong [[Cockney]] accent, to speak so well he could pass her off as a [[duchess]] at an embassy [[Ball (dance)|ball]]. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees and describes how women ruin lives (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\").\n\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a [[Waste collector|dustman]], learns of his daughter's new residence (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with \u00a35. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.\n\nEliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\"Just You Wait\"), while the servants feel both annoyed with the noise as well as pitiful for Higgins (\"Servants' Chorus\"). She makes no progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \"gets it\" (\"The Rain in Spain\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable [[Received Pronunciation|upper-class accent]], and is overjoyed at her breakthrough (\"I Could Have Danced All Night\").\n\nAs a trial run, Higgins takes her to [[Ascot Racecourse]] (\"Ascot Gavotte\"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins partly conceals a grin behind his hand. At Ascot, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a young upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her (\"On the Street Where You Live\").\n\nHiggins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball for the final test, where she dances with a foreign prince. Also present is Zoltan Karpathy, a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins, who is an impostor detector. After he dances with Eliza, he declares that she is a Hungarian princess.\n\nAfterward, Eliza's hard work is barely acknowledged, with all the praise going to Higgins (\"You Did It\"). This and his callous treatment of her, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, but not before she throws Higgins' slippers at him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude (\"Just You Wait (Reprise)\"). Outside, Freddy is still waiting (\"On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)\") and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk (\"Show Me\"). Eliza tries to return to her old life but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by \"middle-class morality\", in which he gets drunk before his wedding day (\"Get Me to the Church On Time\"). Eliza eventually ends up visiting Higgins' mother, who is outraged at her son's callous behavior.\n\nThe next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her (\"A Hymn to Him\"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. Higgins attempts to talk Eliza into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant (\"Without You\"). He makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the unsettling realization that she has become an important part of his life (\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\"). He enters his house feeling lonely, reflecting on his callous behaviour and missing Eliza so much that he turns on his [[gramophone]] and listens to her voice. Suddenly, Eliza reappears at the door and turns it off to catch his attention, with Higgins asking, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as [[Eliza Doolittle]]\n* [[Rex Harrison]] as Professor Henry Higgins\n* [[Stanley Holloway]] as Alfred P.

in My Fair Lady.jpg|thumb|Cinematographer Harry Stradling poses with [[Audrey Hepburn]] as [[Eliza Doolittle]] on the set of the film]]\n[[CBS]] head [[William S. Paley]] financed the original Broadway production in exchange for the rights to the cast album (through [[Columbia Records]]). [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] bought the film rights in February 1962 for the then-unprecedented sum of $5.5 million plus 47\u00bc% of the gross over $20 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|title='Mancha' To UA: $2,250,000-Plus}}</ref> It was agreed that the rights to the film would revert to CBS seven years following release.<ref>Metz, Robert (July 21, 1975). \"The Biggest Man in Broadcasting\" (pp. 48-50) ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Vol. 8, #29.</ref>\n\n===Order of musical numbers===\nThe order of the songs in the Broadway show was followed faithfully with the exception of \"With a Little Bit of Luck\"; the song is listed as the third musical number in the play, but in the film, it is the fourth. On stage, the song is split into two parts sung in two different scenes. Part of the song is sung by Doolittle and his cronies just after Eliza gives him part of her earnings, immediately before she goes to Higgins to ask for speech lessons. The second half of the song is sung by Doolittle just after he discovers that Eliza is now living with Higgins. In the film, the entire song is sung in one scene that takes place just after Higgins has sung \"I'm an Ordinary Man.\" However, the song does have a dialogue scene (Doolittle's conversation with Eliza's landlady) between verses.\n\nThe instrumental \"Busker Sequence\", which opens the play immediately after the [[overture]], is the only musical number from the play omitted in the film version. However, several measures from the piece may be heard when Eliza is in the rain, making her way through Covent Garden.\n\nAll of the songs in the film were performed in their entirety, but some verses were omitted. For example, in the song \"With a Little Bit of Luck\", the verse \"He does not have a [[Twopence (British pre-decimal coin)|tuppence]] in his pocket,\" which was sung with a chorus, was omitted because of its space and length; the original verse in \"Show Me\" was used instead.\n\nThe stanzas of \"You Did It\" that come after Higgins says \"She is a princess\" were originally written for the stage, but Harrison hated the lyrics and refused to perform the song unless the lyrics were omitted, as they were in most Broadway versions. However, when Cukor threatened to leave the production if the omitted lyrics were not restored for the film version, Harrison obliged. The omitted lyrics end with the words \"Hungarian rhapsody\" followed by the servants shouting \"Bravo\" three times, to the strains of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s \"Hungarian Rhapsody\", before the servants sing \"Congratulations, Professor Higgins.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lerner|first= Alan Jay|year=1985|title=The Street Where I Live|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 0-306-80602-9}}</ref>\n\n===Dubbing===\nHepburn's singing was judged inadequate, and she was dubbed by [[Marni Nixon]],<ref>Lawson, Kyle.

Hepburn sang the brief reprise of the song in tears. Some of Hepburn's original vocal performances were released in the 1990s. Less well known is the fact that [[Jeremy Brett]]'s songs (as Freddy) were dubbed by [[Bill Shirley]].<ref>{{IMDb name|0794301|Bill Shirley}}</ref>\n\nHarrison declined to prerecord his musical numbers, explaining that he had never talked his way through the songs the same way twice and thus could not convincingly [[Lip sync|lip-sync]] to a playback recording during filming (according to [[Jack L. Warner]], dubbing had been commonplace for years, stating, \"We even dubbed [[Rin Tin Tin]].\").<ref>Stirling, Richard.
