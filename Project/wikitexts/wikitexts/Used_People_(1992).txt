It is an international co-production between Japan and the United States.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn the 1960s, Pearl Berman has just returned home from her husband Jack's funeral, her grief disrupted by her many relatives animatedly discussing which parkway offered the best route to the [[cemetery]]. Pearl's family tackles any and every subject \u2013 from [[body odor]] to [[toilet]]s to [[Tupperware]] to [[borscht]] \u2013 as if it is worthy of a major debate.\n\nInto a household filled with [[List of English words of Yiddish origin#kvetch|kvetch]]ers steps Joe Meledandri, a distinguished [[Italians|Italian]] who years ago met Pearl's wayward husband in a bar, and convinced him to return to her. He has desired her ever since, and now that Pearl is a [[widow]], Joe feels the time is right to make his move. He invites her for coffee, his first step on the road to seduction.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if he can overcome family objections to religious differences and if he is willing to accept Pearl's daughters: the lonely, overweight Bibby and the pretty but psychologically unstable Norma, who dresses up as celebrities to escape the grief that has overwhelmed her since the death of one of her children and divorce from her husband.  At her father's funeral, Norma dresses up the way [[Jackie Kennedy]] appeared at the funeral of [[John F. Kennedy|her husband]]; appears as [[Marilyn Monroe]] as she serves her surviving son his breakfast; and also impersonates [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], among others, and those are just some of the crazy relatives who come as part of the package.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Shirley MacLaine]] as Pearl Berman\n*[[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Joe Meledandri\n*[[Bob Dishy]] as Jack Berman\n*[[Kathy Bates]] as Bibby Berman\n*[[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Norma\n*[[Jessica Tandy]] as Freida\n*[[Sylvia Sidney]] as Becky\n*[[Lee Wallace (actor)|Lee Wallace]] as Uncle Harry\n*[[Doris Roberts]] as Aunt Lonnie\n*[[Joe Pantoliano]] as Frank\n*[[Louis Guss]] as Uncle Normy\n*[[Helen Hanft]] as Aunt Ruthie\n*[[Gil Filar]] as Mark\n\n==Principal production credits==\n*[[Film producer|Producer]] \u2013 [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]]\n*[[Executive producer]]s \u2013 [[Michael Barnathan]], [[Lloyd Levin]]\n*[[Film score|Original music]] \u2013 [[Rachel Portman]]\n*[[Cinematography]] \u2013 [[David Watkin (cinematographer)|David Watkin]]\n*[[Choreography]] \u2013 [[Patricia Birch]]\n*[[Production designer]] \u2013 Stuart Wurtzel\n*[[Art director]] \u2013 Gregory P.

It also slathers the ethnic equivalent of corn onto every sentimental scene.\"<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0D71E3EF935A25751C1A964958260 ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, \"The movie is by turns serious, satirical, bittersweet, maudlin, satirical, romantic, and farcical... MacLaine is a pro and survives the material... We care about her enough, indeed, to wonder if meeting the Mastroianni character is really the best thing that could have happened to her. He doesn't often seem like a real human in this movie; he's more like an all-purpose writer's device. The odds are against any sane person being able to behave like this man... what the movie could not overcome, for me at least, is the lack of any convincing romantic chemistry between [the two].\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921225/REVIEWS/212250305/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"A modern, absurdist sensibility informs the [[soap opera]] ''Used People''... which harks back to '50s weepies... MacLaine's precise acting is laudatory and balanced by a very sympathetic turn by twinkle-eyed Mastroianni, in his best English-language role by far. The support ensemble is excellent.\"<ref>[http://www2.variety.com/ref.asp?u=IMDB&p=H2BE&sid=VE1117796059 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, \"''Used People'' wants to be ''[[Moonstruck]]'' with [[Matzah balls|matzo balls]], but it's less an eccentric romantic comedy than an icky, three-layered [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] joke... it's rich in character if rather trite in theme and scene.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/usedpeoplepg13kempley_a0a34e.htm ''The Washington Post'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Michael Sragow observed, \"Life goes on \u2013 for the audience, seemingly forever \u2014 in yet another ethnic comedy-drama ... In the end, love conquers everything from religious differences to mental illness: everything, that is, except the forced eccentricity and bickering stereotypes in Todd Graff's script.\"<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/used_people_kidron ''The New Yorker'' review]</ref>\n\nIn his review of the [[videotape]] release, Ty Burr of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the film C- and added, \"Everything's in italics in this Jewish ''Moonstruck''... MacLaine honks nasally ... Mastroianni talks in [[spumoni]] [[aphorism]]s... the score oompahs with grating merriment as characters parade cutesy tics instead of human traits. With stars as gifted as Jessica Tandy, Sylvia Sidney, and Kathy Bates drowning in the tough-talking treacle, it's one of those movies that gives New York a worse name than it already has.\"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306756,00.html ''Entertainment Weekly'' review]</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $18 million in the United States and Canada,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=usedpeople.htm|title=Used People|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> and $10 million overseas for a worldwide total of $28 million.<ref name=gross/>\n\n==Accolades==\nMarcello Mastroianni was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and Shirley MacLaine was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].
