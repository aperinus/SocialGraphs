In 2009, Carnahan was hired to rewrite the script. With a planned December 2012 release and a projected budget of $125 million, filming began in July 2011 in [[Malta]], before moving to [[Glasgow]] in August and [[Budapest]] in October. The production suffered some setbacks, and, in June 2012, the release date was pushed back, and the crew returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. [[Damon Lindelof]] was hired to rewrite the third act, but did not have time to finish the script, and [[Drew Goddard]] was hired to finish the rewrite. The reshoots took place between September and October 2012, ballooning the budget to a reported $190 million, although some publications have listed it as high as $269 million.\n\nThe film premiered in [[London]] on June 2, 2013, and was chosen to open the [[35th Moscow International Film Festival]]. It premiered in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] on June 14, and was released elsewhere in the United States on June 21, in 2D and [[RealD 3D]]. Reviews were positive for Brad Pitt's performance and for the film as a realistic revival of the zombie genre, but there was criticism of what some felt was an anti-climax, outdated CGI, and a lack of faithfulness to the source material. Regardless, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $540 million against a production budget of $190 million, making it the highest-grossing zombie film of all time. A sequel was announced shortly after the film's release, but in February 2019 plans for the sequel were cancelled, reportedly due to budget issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/world-war-z-sequel-dead-david-fincher-brad-pitt-paramount-1202041748/|title=David Fincher's 'World War Z' Sequel Shuts Down at Paramount Over Reported Budget Issues |last= Sharf |first= Zack |date=2019-02-06|website=IndieWire |access-date=2019-04-03|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190207072210/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/world-war-z-sequel-dead-david-fincher-brad-pitt-paramount-1202041748/|archive-date=February 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--NOTE FOR EDITORS. THE MANUAL OF STYLE FOR FILMS SAYS PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. PLEASE TAKE ANY LENGTHY ADDITIONS YOU WISH TO ADD TO THE TALK PAGE.  -->\n\nFormer [[United Nations]] investigator Gerry Lane, his wife, Karin, and their two daughters, Rachel and Connie, are in heavy [[Philadelphia]] traffic when the city is overrun by [[zombie]]s; Gerry discovers it takes 12 seconds for an infection to complete. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and take refuge in an apartment with a couple and their young son, Tommy. They are rescued by a helicopter sent by [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations|U.N. Deputy Secretary-General]] Thierry Umutoni, and bring Tommy with them after his parents were both infected due to their refusal to accompany them. The group is brought to a [[U.S. Navy]] vessel in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the outbreak. Andrew Fassbach, a [[virologist]], insists the plague is a [[virus]] and the development of a vaccine depends on finding its origin, and Gerry, after his family are threatened with eviction from the safety of the vessel, agrees to help Fassbach in his search.\n\nGerry, Fassbach, and a [[Navy SEAL]] escort first fly to [[Camp Humphreys]] in [[South Korea]] where the first report of zombies occurred. Upon landing they are attacked by zombies causing Fassbach to panic and accidentally kill himself when he trips over and accidentally shoots himself in the head with his own gun. American soldiers at the camp rescue the team, and Gerry learns the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor. Gerry interviews an imprisoned [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer at the base who tells him to go to [[Israel]], revealing Israeli [[Mossad]] were able to learn about the virus before the outbreak occurred and managed to build a safe zone. Karin attempts to contact Gerry by phone and the group is attacked by zombies attracted by the ringing, while only Gerry and the pilot escape.\n\nIn [[Jerusalem]], Gerry meets Jurgen Warmbrunn, a high-ranking official in Mossad, who explains that they have intercepted the communications from armies of [[India]]n troops fighting against the \"[[rakshasa]]\" (Zombies). With their knowledge, the country managed to quarantine itself by building a large wall, and allows a large number of refugees to enter the city. While Warmbrunn shows Gerry around, a loud celebratory singing from the refugees attracts zombies from the outside of the city and they breach the wall. As the city is quickly overrun, Warmbrunn orders [[Israeli soldiers]] to escort Gerry back to his plane, being provided air support from an [[Israeli Defence Force]] helicopter. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an old man and an emaciated boy. When one of the escorts, identifying herself only as \"Segen\", is bitten on the hand, Gerry quickly amputates the appendage, preventing further infection, and the pair are able to make it out of the city aboard a commercial airliner.\n\nMusing on what he saw in Jerusalem, Gerry calls Thierry, and has him divert the plane to a [[World Health Organization]] medical research facility in [[Cardiff]]. On approach, a stowaway zombie is discovered, and the majority of passengers and the flight attendants are quickly infected. Gerry sets off a grenade to rupture the cabin and eject the zombies, but it also results in a crash landing.\n\nGerry and Segen survive the crash and make their way to the Cardiff facility where he faints from his injuries. Three days later, Gerry awakens and explains a theory &ndash; that the zombies ignore terminally ill or severely injured people as they are unsuitable hosts for the infection &ndash; to WHO employees. He suggests injecting themselves with a deadly pathogen to act as a \"camouflage\" against the zombies. However, the scientists point out their pathogens are located in a zombie infested portion of the facility. Gerry, Segen, and the head doctor battle their way through the lab, where Gerry finds himself in the room with the pathogen samples. Before he can leave, a lone zombie appears behind the door and blocks Gerry\u2019s only means of escape; forcing him to inject himself with one of the pathogens to test his theory.  When Gerry opens the door, his theory is proven correct; the zombie ignores him, allowing him to walk with the pathogen samples and safely bypass the rest of the zombies in the lab.\n\nGerry and Segen arrive at a safe zone in [[Freeport, Nova Scotia]], where he is reunited with his family and Tommy. A vaccine is then developed which acts as a camouflage against the zombies, allowing survivors to safely escape zombie-infested areas, and even mount offensives against them, but the war goes on.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in closing credits order -->\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Gerry Lane, a former [[United Nations]] investigator who agrees to investigate the zombie pandemic to protect his wife and children\n* [[Mireille Enos]] as Karin Lane, Gerry's wife and Rachel and Connie's mother\n* [[Daniella Kertesz]] as Segen, a soldier in the [[Israel]] [[Israel Defense Forces|Defense Forces]] who accompanies Gerry after Jerusalem falls (\"Segen\" is an [[Israel Defense Forces ranks|IDF rank]] equivalent to a Lieutenant)\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Captain Speke, a [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Ranger]] stationed at [[Camp Humphreys]] in [[South Korea]]\n* [[Ludi Boeken]] as Jurgen Warmbrunn, a high-ranking official in the [[Mossad]]\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Parajumper]], who is sent to extract the Lane family from [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and bring them to the U.N. vessel\n* [[Fana Mokoena]] as Thierry Umutoni, the [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations]], who used to be Gerry's boss and enlists Gerry to investigate the pandemic\n* [[David Morse]] as Ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, who was imprisoned in South Korea for assisting [[North Korea]]'s fight against the zombies\n* [[Elyes Gabel]] as Andrew Fassbach, a young [[Harvard]] [[virologist]] who goes to South Korea with Gerry\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as [[W.H.O.]] Doctor (in Wales)\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as W.H.O.

However, Lindelof, who also reworked ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and co-wrote ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', did not have time to script the new ending, so in July Paramount hired his ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' partner [[Drew Goddard]] to finish the work.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=July 11, 2012 |title=Comic-Con: Drew Goddard Scripts New Ending To Brad Pitt's ''World War Z'' |url=https://deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-drew-goddard-scripts-new-ending-to-brad-pitts-world-war-z/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=July 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712060651/http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-drew-goddard-scripts-new-ending-to-brad-pitts-world-war-z/ |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Goddard later told ''Creative Screenwriting'': \"To me the big lesson of ''World War Z'' was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.'{{sic}} That doesn't happen a lot.
