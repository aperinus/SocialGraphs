The film was directed by [[Shane Black]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Drew Pearce]], and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[St\u00e9phanie Szostak]], [[James Badge Dale]], [[Jon Favreau]], and [[Ben Kingsley]]. In ''Iron Man 3'', Tony Stark wrestles with the ramifications of the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' during a national terrorism campaign on the United States led by the mysterious [[Mandarin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mandarin]].\n\nAfter the release of ''Iron Man 2'' in May 2010, director Favreau chose not to return for a third film. Black was hired to write and direct the sequel in February 2011, working with Pearce to make the script more character-centric, focus on thriller elements, and use concepts from [[Warren Ellis]]'s \"[[Extremis]]\" comic book story arc. The film's supporting cast, including Kingsley, Pearce, and Hall, were brought on throughout April and May 2012. Filming took place from May 23 to December 17, 2012, primarily at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Additional filming took place around [[North Carolina]] as well as in [[Florida]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[China]]; an extended version of the film specifically for Chinese audiences was created. Seventeen companies provided the film's visual effects.\n\n''Iron Man 3'' premiered at the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris on April 14, 2013, and released in the United States on May 3, as the first film in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences, Black's direction, and Downey's performance, though there was criticism for its portrayal of the Mandarin. The film was a box office success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2013]] and the sixteenth film to gross over $1 billion. It finished its theatrical run as the [[List of highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of all time]], while its opening weekend was the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|sixth-highest of all time]]. The film received Best Visual Effects nominations at the [[86th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] and the [[67th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 to 700 words ONLY.-->\nAt a [[New Year's Eve]] [[Millennium celebrations|party in 1999]], [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] meets scientist [[Maya Hansen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya Hansen]], the inventor of an experimental regenerative treatment named [[Extremis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Extremis]] that allows recovery from crippling injuries.

Stark's security chief [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in one such attack at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|TCL Chinese Theatre]] and is put into a coma, prompting Stark to boldly issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his [[artificial intelligence]] [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] pilots to rural [[Tennessee]], following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional and lacks sufficient power to return to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], leaving the world to believe that he is dead.\n\nWith the help of a local boy named Harley Keener, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack, although it occurred years before any known attack by the terrorist. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot to cover up Extremis' flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents [[Eric Savin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Savin]] and [[Ellen Brandt (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Brandt]] attack him: Stark kills Brandt and incapacitates Savin. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts with assistance from Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]]\u2014the former War Machine, now re-branded as the [[Iron Patriot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Patriot]]\u2014lured into a trap to steal his armor.\n\nStark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside, he discovers the Mandarin is an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. When Hansen betrays Killian by threatening to jeopardize his operations, Killian fatally shoots her.\n\nStark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]], using the Iron Patriot armor, controlled by Savin. Stark kills Savin, saving the passengers and crew, but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President would then become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders, in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's<!--credited as \"Vice President's daughter\"--> disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. Before he can save her, a rig collapses around them, and she falls to the platform below, causing Stark to believe her dead. Stark fights Killian but finds himself cornered. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian to save Stark.\n\nAs a gesture of his devotion to Potts, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all the Iron Man suits. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested, and Happy awakens from his coma. With Stark's help, Potts's Extremis effects are stabilized; and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.<!--\n\nPer MOS:FILMPLOT, please do not include the post-credit scene here.

Prolonged exposure to Extremis also grants him the ability to breathe fire. Pearce felt he was \"a little more experimental\" in the roles he was taking in his career, and was not keen on appearing in a superhero film, but felt his role in this film was \"cameo stuff\" which was a more enjoyable experience because he was \"working in concentrated spurts\".<ref name=\"Pearce2\" /> Pearce described Killian as a man with physical disabilities who has \"never been able to accept those limitations\" and works to overcome them, continuing, \"His tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating, as he often comes across as obnoxious.\"<ref name=\"Pearce\" /> Black felt that Pearce ultimately is the Mandarin in the film, and that Marvel worked with him \"to come up with these crazy things, these far out ideas\" that divert from established expectations from the comics.<ref name=\"MandarinEW\" />\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as [[Maya Hansen (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya Hansen]]: <br />A geneticist whose work helped Killian create Extremis.<ref name=\"IM3Characters\" /><ref name=\"HallTHR\" /><ref name=\"HallVariety\" /> Hall said Hansen would be a \"strong female character,\" and described her decision to take the role, saying, \"I decided to do ''Iron Man 3'' because I've never done the '[[hurry up and wait]]' movie before.

He remained an executive producer of director [[Joss Whedon]]'s crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and also served as an executive producer of ''Iron Man 3''.<ref name=\"FavreauProducer\" /><ref name=\"FavreauNotDirecting\" /> Also in 2010, Downey reached out to [[Shane Black]], who directed him in 2005's ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', to write and direct the film.<ref name=\"BlackTHRMar2016\" /> In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project,<ref name=\"BlackDirecting\" /><ref name=\"BlackWriting\" /> and in March it was announced that [[Drew Pearce]], who Marvel had originally hired for a ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' script, would work with Black on the script.<ref name=\"DrewPearce\" /> Downey said, \"Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct ''Iron Man 3'' to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and I could ever actually sign off on.\"<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" />\n\n====Writing====\nShane Black described his take on the film as not being \"two men in iron suits fighting each other,\" and more like a \"[[Tom Clancy]] thriller\", with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains.<ref name=\"BlackWriting\" /> Drew Pearce added that they would avoid magic and space, with ''Iron Man 3'' being \"a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even ''The Avengers''\". The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script.<ref name=\"WhatCulture\" /> While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], making every moment propel other narrative points forward. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Iron Patriot]] armor and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nThe film's plot is influenced primarily by \"[[Extremis]]\", the 2005\u20132006 ''Iron Man'' comics storyline written by [[Warren Ellis]].<ref name=\"FiOS\" /> The first two acts would remain character-centric, albeit in Shane Black's words \"more hectic, frenetic, and large scale\" to fulfill its sequel obligations, with the third act going for more over-the-top action to what Drew Pearce described as \"giving a sense of opera\". The middle act was compared to ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' in having Tony meeting various people on his journey, and the writers made sure to not make the characters too similar. The initial draft had Maya Hansen herself leading the villainous operation, with the Mandarin and Killian emerging as antagonists in later versions of the script. During one of the writing sessions, Pearce suggested that the Mandarin was a fake, and Black agreed by going with making him an actor, which in turn Pearce detailed as an overacting British stage performer. Black explained: \"Who would be fool enough to declare that he is an international terrorist? If you're smart, whatever regime you're part of, you'd put a [[Puppet state|puppet committee]] and remain your house.\" In turn Killian would hide [[Trevor Slattery]] in \"his own [[frat house]], in kind of a drug-related [[house arrest]]\" to keep the secret alive.<ref name=\"Commentary\" />\n\nAccording to Black, the reveal of the actual villain being Hansen was \"like ''[[Remington Steele]]'', you think it's the man but at the end, the woman has been running the whole show.\" The role was eventually shifted to Killian because of objections by Marvel Entertainment executives, who were concerned with apparent merchandising losses that could come with having a female villain. The roles of several other major female characters were also made smaller in the final film compared to earlier drafts.<ref name=\"BlackMay2016\" />\n\nBoth the opening and the ending of the film were reworked in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like ''Iron Man'' it would begin [[in medias res]], with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voice-over that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would show up in the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as \"I am Tony Stark\" to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to \"I am Iron Man\" to enhance the mythical qualities.<ref name=\"Commentary\" /> On setting the film around [[Christmas]], Black said \"I think it's a sense of if you're doing something on an interesting scale that involves an entire universe of characters, one way to unite them is to have them all undergo a common experience. There's something at Christmas that unites everybody and it already sets a stage within the stage, that wherever you are, you're experiencing this world together. I think that also there's something just pleasing about it to me.\" Pearce added that he would have wanted to see a third ''Iron Man'' film set at Christmas, adding that \"when you're telling a story about taking characters apart, it almost has more resonance if you put it at Christmas and if you're also telling a story about lonelier characters as well. That loneliness is heightened at Christmas.\" Black also felt the character Harley Keener embodied the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] for Stark.<ref name=\"ChristmasSetting\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2011, Marvel Studios reached an agreement to shoot the film primarily out of [[EUE/Screen Gems]] Studios in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].

The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that \"Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put [[motion capture|tracking markers]] on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height\u2014Iron Man is 6'5\". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, [[Canon EOS C300|Canon C300s]], and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character.\" The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the [[Aurora|aurora borealis]] as reference for the effect of the glowing Extremis characters.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the [[connectogram]], a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.<ref name=\"BarbasMRI\" />\n\nThe film's production was delayed following Downey's leg injury, and for certain shots they were forced to create a double for Downey. Townsend explained that \"The collective VFX [supervisors] and unit leads ran into a room as soon as the incident happened to try to ascertain what sequences could they shoot.\" Certain shots were filmed with a body double on set, and Weta Digital created a digital body double for others.<ref name=\"CGSociety\" />\n\nA total of three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits),<ref name=\"Commentary\" /> marking the longest stand-alone ''Iron Man'' film.<ref name=\"FiOS\" /> Post-production also had a [[3D film|3D]] conversion<ref name=\"3DConversion\" /> and a digital remaster for the [[IMAX]] release.<ref name=\"IMAX\" /> [[Todd-AO]] mixed the sound in [[Dolby Atmos]] to enhance the immersive experience.<ref name=\"DolbyAtmos\" /> Trevor Slattery was originally meant to die in the film, appearing during the climatic oil rig battle with an Extremis injector and promptly blowing up after taking it. Pearce said that was \"the most ''[[Monty Python]]'' of all of the beats\" in the film.

The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets,<ref name=\"ScorePR\" /> to be \"both a march and anthem.\" Tyler mentioned that [[John Williams]]' work on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was the first thing he thought of as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in ''Raiders'' influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a \"technology so advanced that nears magic.\" Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music \"that borrows from many cultures,\" from \"Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East.\"<ref name=\"TylerPodcast\" /> The score was recorded with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"ScorePR\" />\n\nAlong with Tyler's [[Iron Man 3 (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], [[Hollywood Records]] released a [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Heroes Fall''.

Black and company throw all kinds of stuff at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated.\"<ref name=\"TuranReview\" /> Rafer Guzman of ''[[Newsday]]'' characterized Iron Man as \"the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out.\"<ref name=\"GuzmanReview\" /> ''[[Psychology Today]]'' concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms.<ref name=\"PsychologyToday\" /> Michael Arbeiter of [[Hollywood.com]] praised the film as \"Marvel's First True Action-Comedy\", commenting that \"Tony's camaraderie with preteen tech geek Harley Keener is one gigantic superhero/'90s-kid-sidekick laugh riot (the friggin' kid's name is ''Harley Keener'' ... is there anything more '90s-kid-sidekick-sounding than that?!).\"<ref name=\"Arbeiter\">{{Cite news |last=Arbeiter |first=Michael |title=''Iron Man 3'' Is Marvel's First True Action-Comedy |work=[[Hollywood.com]] |url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/iron-man-3-robert-downey-jr-marvel-first-action-comedy-57391771/ |access-date=November 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNick De Semlyen of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it \"a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles,\" he said the villainous \"super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [are] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing.\"<ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'' New York]] bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, \"Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and is simply too good to ruin here.\" But, he asked, \"[W]hy, finally, are we down at the docks\u2014in the dark, no less\u2014for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes? The energy bleeds out of the film; it's as if the producers were scared the crowd would riot over ''not enough'' digital fakeness.\"<ref name=\"TONYReview\" />\n\nReacting more negatively, Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' found the film \"slickly enjoyable\" for the visual effects, but said, \"[T]here's something empty about the film. Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside ... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second ... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy\u2014and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick\u2014a true sign of authorial desperation\u2014is introduced, and then dropped.\"<ref name=\"StarLedgerReview\" /> [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' echoed this, saying, \"[I]n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in ''Iron Man 3'', I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old {{sic}} (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior ... Stark no longer needs to be in the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery is more or less taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first ''Iron Man''.\"<ref

Man 3'' focuses on contemporary [[U.S. foreign policy]] and its consequences.<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" /> Like the first ''Iron Man'' film, it is about the [[military industrial complex]]. The main antagonist, Killian, tries to take over the US government and capitalize on the [[War on Terror]] with a decoy villain actor, the Mandarin; the supposed looming menace distracts the public from Killian's actions with a narrative of the constant threat that also makes the war profitable.<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" /> Using Stark as a metaphor of American society, Charlie Jane Anders of ''[[Gizmodo]]'' notes that the film differs in the portrayal of the country from the previous two entries; whereas the previous films were about the guilt of ruining areas in foreign countries, ''Iron Man 3'' is about the feeling of powerlessness, in that a trusted, wealthy and individualistic celebrity like Stark is unable to find a powerful terrorist such as the Mandarian.<ref name=\"JaneAnders2013\" />\n\nThe Mandarin, a cover-up adversary that is otherwise non-threatening, is a take on Americans' [[xenophobia]] towards [[Middle Eastern]]s,<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" /> and how people's fear is taken advantage of to create and pass harmful policies.<ref name=\"Conversation2014\" /> The Mandarin's characteristics are what the population expects from a terrorist, such as a large beard, army pants, and comments he gives to the media that condemn the US. The twist that the Mandarin is fake also plays on audiences' [[availability heuristic]]s that make them think if someone is a danger or not.<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" />\n\n''Iron Man 3'' is part of a trend in [[post-9/11]] superhero films consisting of vulnerable, weak superheroes and complex antagonists with realistic motivations.<ref name=\"Conversation2014\" /> Psychologist and author Dr. Travis Langley believed Stark meets all of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'s criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, and Stark, like those with PTSD in real-life, denies he could have it.<ref name=\"LangleyPhd2013\" /> Stark enacts its symptoms, such as [[anxiety attack]]s, [[hypervigilance]], [[Nightmare disorder|frequent nightmares]], and an inability to be in the public;<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" /><ref name=\"LangleyPhd2013\" /> this deviates from most portrayals of not only superheroes but also strong male leads in general, where they are not traumatized from perilous situations.<ref name=\"Rekdal2013\" />\n\n==Future==\n===Potential sequel===\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\nIn March 2013, Black stated that Downey's original contract with [[Marvel Studios]], which expired after the release of ''Iron Man 3'', may be extended in order for the actor to appear in a second ''Avengers'' film and at least one more ''Iron Man'' film. He said: \"There has been a lot of discussion about it: 'Is this the last ''Iron Man'' for Robert [Downey, Jr.]?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Keyes |first=Rob |date=March 2, 2013 |title=Shane Black Teases Robert Downey Jr.'s Return For Iron Man 4 & 5 |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-5-robert-downey-jr/ |access-date=March 10, 2013 |website=Screen Rant}}</ref> In April 2013, Cheadle stated that ''Iron Man 3'' could be the final film in the series, saying, \"The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway.\"<ref name=\"Cheadle2\" /> In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, \"There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth ''Iron Man''.\"<ref name=\"VarietySept2014\" /> In April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth ''Iron Man'' film.<ref name=\"I Could Do One More\" /> After the death of Tony Stark in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), co-screenwriter [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely|Stephen McFeely]] said, \"You would've already had ''Iron Man 4'' if it was any other studio\", remarking that it was a bold move by Marvel to kill off the character.<ref name=\"VanityFairNov2019\" /> In January 2020, when asked if he would reprise the role of Iron Man, Downey noted, \"Yeah, anything could happen... As far as I'm concerned, I hung up my guns and I'm good to let it go... It's hard to project.\"<ref name=\"DowneyJan2020\" />\n\n===Marvel One-Shot===\n{{main|All Hail the King}}\nIn February 2014, Marvel released the [[Marvel One-Shots|One-Shot]] film, ''All Hail the King'', on ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s home media, featuring Kingsley reprising his role as Trevor Slattery. It continues Slattery's story from the end of the film, revealing that the [[Wenwu|real Mandarin]] actually exists in the MCU.<ref name=\"AHTK\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring powered
