However, that recognition is contrasted by his exasperated next-door neighbours, some of whom are fed up with his un-neighbourly habits; such as revving his motorbike early in the morning, urinating on his lemon tree, and not mowing his grass.  Burt, however, has a long-time dream; to travel to the US and test his motorbike's capabilities at the [[Bonneville Speedway]].\nHowever, while modifying his motorcycle, Burt suffers a heart attack. An ambulance takes him to hospital and he is told he has [[angina]], and is advised to take it easy and not to ride his motorcycle. Burt ignores this advice, and is given medication.\n\nBurt is finally able to save enough to travel by cargo ship to [[Los Angeles]], working his passage as the cook, but when he arrives, he experiences [[bureaucracy#Criticism|bureaucracy]], skepticism, and the indifference of big city people.  It is his blunt but gregarious nature which overcomes each hurdle.  He wins over the motel clerk, a [[transvestite]] named Tina, who assists him in clearing customs and helps him in buying a car.  The car salesman allows Burt to use his [[workshop]] and junkyard to build a trailer, and later offers him a job after Burt fine-tunes a number of the cars on the lot.  Burt declines the offer, however, and shortly afterwards begins his long trip to [[Utah]].\n\nAlong the way, Burt meets numerous helpful people, including highway police, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] who aids him when his trailer fails, a woman named Ada who allows him to repair his trailer in her garage and briefly becomes his lover, and an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] pilot who is on leave from military service in Vietnam.\n\nHe finally arrives at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], only to be blocked by race officials for not registering his motorcycle for competition in advance, and not having the mandated safety equipment.  In a show of sportsmanship, however, various competitors and fans in the Bonneville series intervene on his behalf, and he is eventually allowed to make a timed run.  Despite various problems, he succeeds in his quest and sets a new [[land speed record]] at the 8th mile of his run; when he reaches 201.851&nbsp;mph (324.847&nbsp;km/h). By the end, his leg is burned by the exhaust, and he then falls with the motorcycle and skids to a stop, but he is able to return home to New Zealand as a hero. An epilogue describes that he went to Bonneville again several times to compete and set new records.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Burt Munro]]\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Wendy \n* [[Joe Howard (actor)|Joe Howard]] as Otto\n* [[Chris Williams (actor)|Chris Williams]] as Tina, a transvestite motel clerk\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Fernando, a used car salesman\n* [[Christopher Lawford]] as Jim Moffet\n* Gavin Grazer as Mike Sobota\n* [[Annie Whittle]] as Fran\n* [[Aaron James Murphy]] as Tom\n* [[Chris Bruno]] as Bob\n* [[Tim Shadbolt]] as Frank\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Jerry\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Ada\n* [[Saginaw Grant]] as Jake\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Marty\n* [[William Lucking]] as [[Rollie Free|Rollie Free]]\n* [[Patrick John Flueger]] as Rusty\n* Daniel Sing as Ken\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Roger Donaldson]] had been working on this film for over 20 years before he started filming it, and had previously directed a short television [[documentary]] about Munro called ''Burt Munro: Offerings to the God of Speed'' in 1971. Arranging the financing for a full feature film was much more difficult, but a key Japanese investor, and Donaldson and Hannam's own money allowed the film to be made.<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/sunday-theatre/interview-writer-director-and-producer-roger-donaldson-978853 \"An interview with writer/director and producer Roger Donaldson\"], TVNZ.co.nz</ref><ref>[http://emanuellevy.com/interviews/donaldson-on-worlds-fastest-indian-6/ \"Donaldson on World's Fastest Indian\"], 17 December 2005, emanuellevy.com</ref><ref name=herald/>\n\nIn interviews, Hopkins stated that Munro was one of the easiest roles that he has ever played in his career; simply because Munro's view on life was not all that different from his own.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/the_worlds_fastest_indian.htm| publisher=Solarnavigator.net | title=''The World's Fastest Indian| access-date=21 May 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609023847/http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/the_worlds_fastest_indian.htm| archive-date= 9 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nMany of the props used for filming were actually owned by Munro, including all the exploded [[piston]]s and the piston mould that Hopkins uses for a scene in the film.  These were on display at the [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The location used for Burt Munro's home and [[workshop]] in New Zealand took place on an empty section on Lithgow Street in Invercargill, this section was used as the headquarters for the notorious [[Black Power (New Zealand)|Black Power]] gang during the 1990s until the house burnt down in 1998. A house has been built on the plot since the film was released.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n[[File:Burt Munro's Indian Special replica from the movie \"The world's Fastest Indian\".jpg|thumb|upright|A replica of Munro's [[Indian Scout (motorcycle)|Indian]] used in the movie]]\n\nThe real Burt Munro married Florence Beryl Martyn on 6 August 1925; they divorced in 1950\u201351. While the couple had four children together, no mention is made of children in the film; but it is implied that he was married, and either estranged or divorced.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Munro portrayed in the film recalls the death of a twin brother named Ernie, who died when a tree fell on him. The real Munro had an older brother who was killed when a tree fell on him.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Munro also had a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] [[twin]] sister. The real Munro had set numerous speed records in New Zealand during the late 1930s through the early 1970s.  However, these records are only implied in the film.  Munro was never known to actually [[urinate]] on his lemon tree; film director [[Roger Donaldson]] added that detail as a tribute to his own father, who did.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn reality, Munro's record-breaking run at Bonneville came after several separate visits to the US, beginning in 1956. This was demonstrated, for instance, by a letter published in the May 1957 edition of ''Popular Mechanics'' (p.&nbsp;6), which referred to 'H.&nbsp;A. \"Dad\" Munro' and his 1920 Indian Scout.<ref name=\"Popular Mechanics\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KeEDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false Popular Mechanics - May 1957]</ref> The visit to Bonneville shown in the film was a composite of several made by Munro. In 1962 he set a record of 178.971&nbsp;mph at Bonneville. His fastest complete run there was 190.07&nbsp;mph. While Munro did reach 205.67&nbsp;mph on an uncompleted run, on which he crashed,<ref>[http://www.indianmotorbikes.com/features/munro/munro.htm Burt Munro - A New Zealand Legend, The Munro Special<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723101934/http://www.indianmotorbikes.com/features/munro/munro.htm |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> he never set a record of 201&nbsp;mph at Bonneville (as the film suggests).\n\nNear the end of the film, Speed Week participants throw money into 'the hat', and Burt Munro is presented with a bag of cash before he sets the speed record.  In fact, Munro had to take up a collection before Speed Week, as US Customs required a cash bond before releasing his motorcycle.<ref>[http://ns2.webmasters.com/* gsbmwr.org/httpdocs/Archives/Munro.pdf From the article ''HERO!'' reprinted through the courtesy of ''Classic Bike'' magazine by the Granite State BMW Riders<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202212426/http://ns2.webmasters.com/*abdirect.us/httpdocs/page3Header.jpg |date=2 February 2011 }}</ref>  A photograph of the gathered crowd presenting Munro with the bag of cash, in 1962, was reprinted in a 2006 issue of ''Hot Rod'' magazine.\n\n==Hopkins' portrayal of a New Zealander==\nThe [[Welsh people|Welsh]]-born Hopkins did not employ the Kiwi accent which the real Munro would have had \u2014 the review in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' said that \"his vowels swoop from the Welsh valleys to the high veldt without ever alighting in [[Southland Region|Southland]]\" (Munro's home region of New Zealand).  Nevertheless, the same reviewer had said Hopkins gives a \"generous, genial and utterly approachable performance \u2026 he nails the backyard eccentric genius dead centre \u2026 he has inhaled the nature of a mid-century Kiwi bloody good bloke and he inhabits the part to perfection\".<ref name=herald>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10349290 Peter Calder: The World's Fastest Indian.] ''The New Zealand Herald'', 8 October 2005.</ref>\n\n==Featured vehicles==\nThe 1920 Indian Scout 'Burt Munro Special' \u2014 the 1920 [[Indian Scout (motorcycle)|Indian Scout]] portrayed in the film \u2014 started life as a 600&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] motorcycle with a designed top speed of 55&nbsp;mph.

These modifications were largely done in Munro's [[workshop]], using basic methods and tools as depicted in the film.
