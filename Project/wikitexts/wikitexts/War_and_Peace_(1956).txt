It is directed and co-written by [[King Vidor]], and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Carlo Ponti]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film stars [[Audrey Hepburn]] as [[Natasha Rostova|Natasha]], [[Henry Fonda]] as [[Pierre Bezukhov|Pierre]], and [[Mel Ferrer]] as [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei]], along with [[Oskar Homolka]], [[Vittorio Gassman]], [[Herbert Lom]], [[Jeremy Brett]], [[John Mills]] and [[Anita Ekberg]] in one of her first breakthrough roles. The musical score was composed by [[Nino Rota]] and conducted by [[Franco Ferrara]].\n\n''War and Peace'' opened on August 21, 1956 to a mixed reception, with some reviewers critical with the film truncating much of Tolstoy's novel, and the casting of 50-year old Henry Fonda as the 20-year old Pierre Bezukhov. It received [[Academy Awards]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Color)]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design (Color)]].<ref name=\"Oscars1957\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1957 |title=The 27th Academy Awards (1957) Nominees and Winners |website=oscars.org |access-date=April 26, 2021}}</ref> It was also nominated for four [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] ([[Audrey Hepburn]]), and won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]].<ref name=\"GoldenGlobes1957\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/1957/all |title=Winners & Nominees 1957 |website=Golden Globes |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |access-date=April 26, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2020, the film was shown at the [[70th Berlin International Film Festival]], as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/press/press-releases/detail_8008.html |title=Berlinale 2020: Retrospective \"King Vidor\" |work=Berlinale |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1805, most of Europe is torn apart by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s drive to conquer more and more territory. In [[Moscow]], many young men have joined the army, including [[Nikolai Rostov|Nicholas Rostov]], the son of Count Ilya Rostov and his wife Nataly, and the brother of young Petya and the flighty but devoted [[Natasha Rostova|Natasha]]. The Rostovs' friend [[Pierre Bezukhov|Pierre]], the illegitimate son of the ailing, wealthy Count Bezukhov, has recently returned from [[Paris]] and believes that Napoleon is a \"cleansing force\" who can establish equality and liberty.\n\nDespite his pacifism, Pierre wishes Nicholas well and then visits his friend, army officer Dolokhov, a notorious rake. There, the comrades indulge in drinking games but are interrupted by [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Prince Andrei Bolkonsky]], an officer of much finer character than Dolokhov. Andrei informs Pierre that his estranged father, who is near death, is calling for him, and Pierre goes to his father's mansion, where various relatives snub him. Their derision changes to hypocritical concern, however, after the old count dies and it is discovered that he has accepted Pierre as legitimate and named him his sole heir.\n\nThe scheming [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kuragina]] immediately sets her sights on Pierre and soon he falls in love with her, while her father, Prince Vasily Kuragin, insinuates himself as the administrator of Pierre's vast estates. One day, Pierre runs into Andrei in the country as Andrei is escorting his pregnant wife Lise to his father's house. Andrei, who feels trapped by the clinging Lise, had earlier advised Pierre never to marry, and now Pierre refuses to accept his warnings. After Andrei takes Lise to live with his sister Mary and gruff father, Prince Nicholas Bolkonsky, he leaves for the front and is made an adjutant to the commander of the army, Field Marshal [[Mikhail Kutuzov]]. At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], Andrei attempts to rally the retreating men by grabbing their banner and rushing the enemy, but he is wounded and left for dead. While surveying the battlefield, Napoleon comes across Andrei and, admiring his courage, orders that he be tended to by his personal physician.\n\nIn [[Moscow]], when Pierre learns that the Russians are suing for peace, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne persuades him to return to the country alone so that she can spend the season in the city, welcoming the soldiers. Nicholas comes home safely, much to the delight of Natasha. Meanwhile, Andrei returns to his family, just as Lise goes into labor. Although their son Kolya survives, Lise dies after giving birth, and the grieving Andrei blames himself for not offering her enough comfort and love. As time passes, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne begins a flirtation with Dolokhov, and when Pierre learns of the rumors about them, he insults Dolokhov and accepts his challenge of a duel. Although Pierre is woefully unskilled with firearms, he manages to shoot and wound Dolokhov, while the soldier's shot goes wide and Pierre is unharmed. Infuriated that he was provoked into acting in such an uncivilized manner, Pierre separates from H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and agrees to accompany the Rostovs to their country estate.\n\nOne day, while they are hunting, they meet Andrei, who is enchanted by Natasha. Later, Andrei dances with Natasha when she attends her first ball and realizes that he wants to marry her. Prince Bolkonsky urges Andrei to wait a year, as Natasha is so young and the Rostovs are not their social equals, but promises to consent if Andrei still wishes to marry her then. With Natasha's promise to wait for him, Andrei then joins the mission to Prussia, where [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander]] and Napoleon sign a [[Treaties of Tilsit|peace treaty in June 1807]]. While Andrei is gone, however, Natasha is seduced by [[Anatole Kuragin]], H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's brother, who is as cold-hearted and debauched as his sister. Even though he is secretly married, Anatole persuades Natasha to elope with him, but their plans are foiled by Natasha's cousin Sonya and Pierre, who threatens Anatole with exposure of his marriage if he ruins Natasha's reputation. Pierre's threats come too late, however, and soon all of Moscow is gossiping about Natasha, who falls ill after Andrei ends their relationship. After several months, she begs Pierre to convey her regret to Andrei, and Pierre, who is in love with her, assures her that she is blameless, and that if he were free, he would ask for her hand.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon crosses the [[Neman|River Neman]] into Russia, despite the peace treaty. Faced with the superiority of the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e|French Army]], Kutuzov orders his men to retreat, and as they fall back, the soldiers and peasants set fire to the countryside so that the French will be without provisions. Although his officers protest his strategy, Kutuzov insists that the only way to save Russia is by letting the French wear themselves out. Soon the city of [[Smolensk]] is abandoned and Kutuzov decides to make a stand at [[Borodino]]. Determined to see war firsthand, to decide if his hatred of it is valid, Pierre travels to Borodino, where he finds Andrei's camp on the eve of the battle. Although Pierre urges Andrei to forgive Natasha, Andrei states that he cannot. The next morning, Pierre watches with mounting horror as the fighting rages around him and the French slaughter the Russians. Finally realizing that his hero is just a tyrant, Pierre damns Napoleon. Kutuzov then decides to fall back beyond Moscow, leaving the ancient capital city to the French.\n\nIn Moscow, the Rostovs are among the many families preparing to flee when some wounded Russian soldiers arrive, hoping to be billeted at their home after their departure. Natasha insists that the men cannot be left behind to be captured, however, and they are loaded into the Rostov wagons and taken to a distant village. Napoleon is infuriated to learn that the government has fled, leaving no one behind to surrender to him. Although Pierre lies in wait one day, hoping to assassinate the French emperor, he cannot do it and is taken prisoner. Meanwhile, Natasha has learned that Andrei is among the wounded in their care and reunites with him. While Pierre is befriended by a fellow prisoner, the peasant Platon, the Rostovs take Andrei to a monastery to convalesce. Andrei's wounds prove fatal, however, and he dies just after Mary and Kolya arrive to bid him farewell.\n\nNapoleon realizes that he has been outmaneuvered by Kutuzov, and, fearing being trapped in Russia during the winter, orders his men to retreat. The prisoners, including Pierre and Platon, are forced to accompany the soldiers during their 2,000-mile march, and many of them die. The Russian soldiers follow behind the French, allowing them little rest and picking off stragglers. Petya, who has joined the army against his parents' wishes, is sent with a dispatch to Dolokhov, ordering his platoon to join the main regiment. Eager for one last fight, Dolokhov insists on attacking the French the next morning and allows Petya to accompany him. Petya is killed during the engagement, and although Pierre is freed, he is too overcome by the boy's death to rejoice. Dolokhov informs Pierre that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has died, and later, joins the other Russian soldiers as they attack the French, who are fleeing back across the Niemen.\n\nThe Rostovs return to Moscow and find their mansion a burned-out shell, with only one wing remaining intact. Natasha rallies her family to make the best of what they have, however, and as the others settle in, Natasha sadly remembers happier times. She then sees Pierre in the doorway and rushes to embrace him. Telling him that he is like their house, which suffers and shows its wounds but still stands, Natasha kisses Pierre, and they walk together in the garden.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn War&Peace.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]] (Mel Ferrer, left) and [[Natasha Rostova]] (Audrey Hepburn, right)]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as [[Natasha Rostova]]\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Count [[Pierre Bezukhov]]\n* [[Mel Ferrer]] as Prince [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]\n* [[Vittorio Gassman]] as Prince [[Anatole Kuragin]]\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Oskar Homolka]] as Field Marshal [[Mikhail Kutuzov]]\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Kuragina]]\n* [[Helmut Dantine]] as [[List of War and Peace characters#D|Fedor Dolokhov]]\n* [[Tullio Carminati]] as Prince [[List of War and Peace characters#K|Vasily Kuragin]]\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as Count Mikhail Rostov\n* [[Milly Vitale]] as Lise Bolkonskaya\n* Lea Seidl as Countess Natalya Rostova\n* [[Anna Maria Ferrero]] as [[Maria Bolkonskaya|Mary Bolkonskaya]]\n* [[Wilfrid Lawson (actor)|Wilfrid Lawson]] as Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky\n* [[May Britt]] as Sonya Rostova\n* [[Jeremy Brett]] as [[Nikolai Rostov|Nicholas Rostov]]\n* [[Paddy Crean|Patrick Crean]] as Vas'ka Denisov\n* [[Se\u00e1n Barrett (actor)|Se\u00e1n Barrett]] as [[Petya Rostov]]\n* [[Gertrude Flynn]] as Mariya Peronskaya\n* [[John Mills]] as Platon Karatayev\n* [[Clelia Matania]] as Mademoiselle Geoges (uncredited)\n* [[Gualtiero Tumiati]] as Count Kirill Bezukhov (uncredited)\n* [[Guido Celano]] as Victor (uncredited)\n* [[Marisa Allasio]] as Matrosha (uncredited)\n* [[Maria Zanoli]] as Mavra (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as a Russian officer (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Fernley Fawcett]] as an artillery officer (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nThe film script had to be greatly condensed from the extensive original novel. It is primarily focused on Natasha, Pierre, and Andrei, their complex relationship and personal maturation on the backdrop of the historical events of the Napoleonic invasion.\n* In Moscow, most of the scenes take place at the Rostov residence, and episodes at the country estates are curtailed, with some exceptions such as the hunt where Natasha first meets Andrei. This is a condensation of two scenes at the Rostov country estate, since in the novel Andrei, who by then is already Natasha's fianc\u00e9, is not present at the hunt.\n* There are no scenes in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].\n* The relationship between Nicholas, Sonya and Maria is toned down.\n* Historical figures retained are General Kutuzov and Napoleon.\n* Minor battles are omitted, while Napoleon's [[Battle of Berezina|crossing of the Berezina]], not depicted in the novel, is added.\n* The concept of the inner dialogue is retained, notably in regard to Natasha, but the extensive use of French is not retained in the film.\n* Events of the epilogue are not included, nor are Tolstoy's discourses about history.\n\n==Development==\nBritish producer [[Alexander Korda]] announced interest in adapting Tolstoy\u2019s novel for the screen as early as 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] directing, [[Merle Oberon]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]], with a screenplay by [[Lillian Hellman]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/52056|access-date=2021-01-23|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Korda's production was never realized, due to an inability to strike a deal with the [[Soviet]] government. In the 1950s, [[Mike Todd]] began actively pursuing a film adaptation, even arranging with Soviet and Yugoslavian officials for filming locations and the massive number of required extras, and hiring [[Fred Zinnemann]] to direct. The production was abandoned by Todd in order to focus on [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|''Around the World in Eighty Days'']].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nItalian producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Carlo Ponti]] announced their film in October 1954. Initially, they approached [[Elia Kazan]] to direct and [[G\u00e9rard Philipe]] and [[Marlon Brando]] to star. When a deal with Kazan couldn\u2019t be reached, De Laurentiis tentatively announced [[Mario Camerini]] as his replacement, before [[King Vidor]] was eventually hired.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer on the set of ''War and Peace'' in 1955]]\n[[Audrey Hepburn]], who was one of the biggest female film stars in the world at the time, was cast as Natasha after previous favorite [[Jean Simmons]] turned it down. Todd had previously attempted to hire her for his failed adaptation, but she signed with De Laurentiis and Ponti after they offered a record salary of $350,000. The contract gave Hepburn a fair amount of creative control, including the hiring of costume fitter [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and makeup artist Grazia De Rossi.<ref name=\":0\" /> She also facilitated the hiring of her husband [[Mel Ferrer]] as Andrei, the only time the couple would co-star on-screen together. Because Hepburn was under contract to [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] at the time, the two companies were given the respective US and UK distribution rights in exchange for Hepburn\u2019s services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVidor wanted either [[Paul Scofield]] or [[Peter Ustinov]] as Pierre, but both suggestions were rejected by De Laurentiis, who thought neither actor was \u201cmarketable\u201d. [[Gregory Peck]], [[Montgomery Clift]], [[Stewart Granger]], [[Richard Burton]], and [[Marlon Brando]] were all considered. [[Henry Fonda]], who was eventually cast in the part, was widely thought to be too old to play the role (he was 50 at the time, playing a character 30 years his junior). He later stated he regretted taking the part, only doing so because of the money and because he was a fan of the novel. He claimed that the script he was given was very different from the one used during filming, which was heavily revised by Vidor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Arlene Dahl]] was originally cast as Helene, but she fell ill shortly before filming and was replaced by [[Anita Ekberg]], who was borrowed from Batjac Productions. The film proved to be Ekberg\u2019s breakthrough and helped lead to her international stardom.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Fredric March]] was originally cast as Field Marshal Kutuzov, but was replaced before filming by [[Oskar Homolka]], who would be nominated for a [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] for his performance. [[Valentina Cortese]], [[Gino Cervi]], and [[Massimo Serato]] were all attached in 1955 but were dropped at some point before filming started.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Writing===\n''War and Peace'' has six credited screenwriters, an unusually high number for a mainstream film, even in 1956. The first draft of the screenplay was five hundred six pages, roughly five times the size of an average screenplay.\n\nContemporaneous sources claim that [[Irwin Shaw]] was one of the writers, but insisted his name be stricken from the credits after he learned that Vidor\u2019s wife, [[Elizabeth Hill (screenwriter)|Elizabeth Hill]], rewrote much of the dialogue. Vidor also made extensive rewrites during filming. Uncredited contributors to the final script included [[Jean Aurenche]], [[Pierre Bost]], [[Sergio Amidei]], [[Gian Gaspare Napolitano]], and [[second unit director|second-unit director]] [[Mario Soldati]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot primarily at Ponti-De Laurentiis and [[Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]] in [[Rome]], as well as at locations in Rome, [[Turin]], and [[Sardinia]]. More than 100,000 uniforms, costumes and hairpieces required for the film were reproduced from original, contemporary drawings.<ref name=\":0\" /> About 18,000 Italian military personnel were used as extras in the film\u2019s large-scale battle scenes, which caused some controversy in parliamentary circles.<ref name=\":0\" /> The battle scenes, which were primarily directed by Mario Soldati, employed sixty-five physicians, dressed as soldiers and scattered throughout the location, to take care of any extras or stuntmen who might get injured during filming of the scenes.\n\nFonda repeatedly clashed with De Laurentiis during filming over the characterization of Pierre. De Laurentiis, who had apparently never read the novel, insisted Pierre be played as a more conventional romantic, heroic lead and insisted he not wear [[eyeglass]]es. Fonda claimed that De Laurentiis would go into fits of screaming rage whenever he saw him wearing glasses, which led to him only wearing them whenever De Laurentiis wasn\u2019t present on-set.\n\n===Post-production===\nSwedish actresses [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[May Britt]] had all their dialogue [[dubbing (filmmaking)|re-dubbed]] during editing, due to their accents being considered too strong. Several of the supporting Italian actors were likewise dubbed.\n\nThe Italian version was dubbed completely, supervised by [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] and [[Vittorio Gassmann]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nBy January 1957, ''War and Peace'' had earned $6.25 million in box office rentals from the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n\n===Critical reaction=== \n[[Abel Green]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film as a \"rich contribution to the art form of the picture business in the best tradition.

It is big in the biggest sense of the cinematurgical art and, in this alone, there is a payoff.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Green |first=Abel |url=https://archive.org/details/variety203-1956-08/page/n205/mode/2up |title=Film Reviews: War and Peace |magazine=Variety |page=6 |date=August 22, 1956 |access-date=April 26, 2021 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote the \"picture, technically, is a masterpiece. The massiveness of the sets, the gigantic cast of thousands, the costuming, the surge of vast military forces in conflict, the burning of Moscow, the disastrous retreat of Napoleon's conquering hordes in the midst of a brutal and paralyzing Russian winter --- all this and more is depicted in a way that impresses one with the fact that millions of dollars had gone into the making.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/harrisonsreports38harr/page/n157/mode/2up |title=War and Peace |magazine=Harrison's Reports |page=134 |date=August 25, 1956 |access-date=April 26, 2021 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film as \"massive, colorful and exciting as anything of this sort we've ever seen\". However, he felt the characters were \"second-rate people, hackneyed and without much depth.

But Fonda builds beautifully into his part, using a physical clumsiness as a counterpoise to his soaring spirit, making his rages seem the more terrible since they flash out from passivity.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,808614-1,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures |magazine=Time |date=September 10, 1956 |access-date=April 26, 2021}}</ref> Alternately, Edwin Schallert of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt Fonda was miscast because \"he seems like an anti character in his behavior on the battlefields.
