He is highly intelligent, with an aptitude for [[chemistry]]. He also dreams of poisoning as many people as he can. In his teen years, he poisons a schoolmate&mdash;making him ill rather than killing him&mdash;in order to date a girl his schoolmate was seeing. His conversation with his date involves vivid, graphic descriptions of deadly [[Traffic collision|car accidents]]. He also reads a comic book account of an event in which the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch Resistance]] killed a whole German [[Military camp|army camp]] in the occupied [[Netherlands in World War II|Netherlands during the Second World War]] by poisoning their water supply with [[thallium]].\n\nGraham is arrested at the age of 14 outside his home in [[Neasden]] after poisoning his father and stepmother with [[thallium]], killing his stepmother and leaving his father seriously ill. During the struggle with [[police]], he drops his \"Exit Dose\" of thallium, which he intended to use to commit suicide should he be caught. He is hospitalised for nine years in an institution for the criminally insane, during which time a psychiatrist works with him in the hopes of rehabilitating him.\n\nGraham's dishonesty becomes evident to the doctor, who can see that Graham is trying to deceive him. Graham apparently has no dreams to share with the psychiatrist so he \"borrows\" a fellow prisoner's dreams. This source is shut off to him, however, once the fellow prisoner commits suicide. Despite the initial evidence of Graham's deceitfulness, the doctor eventually gets him released.\n\nGraham then goes to work in a camera factory and is shown the secret ingredient used in the company's shutter system&mdash;thallium. It is not long before Graham starts poisoning people again. He kills two of his workmates by poisoning their tea with thallium stolen from the laboratory, and makes many others ill. For months, the source of the \"bug\" afflicting the workers at the factory remains a mystery until one unforeseen event leads to Graham's being found out. As a hygiene measure, all the personalised teacups are replaced with uniform ones, leaving Graham unable to poison people selectively. His efforts to memorise which cup is going to which person give him away and his workmates finally realise what is going on.\n\nGraham is arrested soon afterwards and he is later sentenced to a lengthy custodial term, this time in an ordinary prison. He commits suicide by poisoning himself with the \"Newton's Diamond\" he made in the psychiatric hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Hugh O'Conor]] \u2013 [[Graham Young]]\n**Tobias Arnold \u2013 Young Graham Young\n*[[Ruth Sheen]] \u2013 Molly\n*[[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] \u2013 Fred\n*Norman Caro \u2013 Mr Goez\n*Dorothea Alexander \u2013 Mrs Goez\n*[[Charlotte Coleman]] \u2013 Winnie\n*Paul Stacey \u2013 Dennis\n*Samantha Edmonds \u2013 Sue\n*Robert Dem \u2013 Mr Dextereger\n*[[Jack Deam]] \u2013 Mick\n*Peter Pacey \u2013 Dickie Boone\n*Joost Siedhoff \u2013 Dr Scott\n*[[Vilma Hollingbery]] \u2013 Aunty Panty\n*[[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]] \u2013 Uncle Jack\n*[[Rupert Farley]] \u2013 Nurse Trent\n*Dirk Robertson \u2013 Nurse Hopwood\n*Chris Lawson \u2013 Prison Officer\n*[[Malcolm Sinclair (actor)|Malcolm Sinclair]] \u2013 Dr Triefus\n*[[Charlie Creed-Miles]] \u2013 Berridge\n*[[Antony Sher]] \u2013 Dr Zeigler\n*[[Cate Fowler]] \u2013 Social Services Worker\n*John Abbott \u2013 Chair\n*Anna Kollenda \u2013 Baby Donna\n*Katja Kollenda \u2013 Baby Donna\n*[[Hazel Douglas]] \u2013 Edna\n*[[Arthur Cox (actor)|Arthur Cox]] \u2013 Ray\n*[[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] \u2013 Nathan\n*Jean Warren \u2013 Debra\n*[[Simon Kunz]] \u2013 John\n*Frank Coda \u2013 Billy\n*[[Tim Potter]] \u2013 Simon\n*Roger Frost \u2013 Factory Manager\n*David Savile \u2013 Chief Medical Inspector\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0115033|title=The Young Poisoner's Handbook}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Young Poisoner's Handbook, The}}\n[[Category:1990s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:British serial killer films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:French black comedy films]]\n[[Category:French serial killer films]]\n[[Category:German black comedy films]]\n[[Category:German serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals]]\n[[Category:1995 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
