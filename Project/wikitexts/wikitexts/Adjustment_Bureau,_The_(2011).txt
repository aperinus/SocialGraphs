Dick]] short story \"[[Adjustment Team]]\".<ref name=\"tribunereview\"/> Starring [[Matt Damon]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[John Slattery]], and [[Terence Stamp]], the film tells the story of a United States congressman who discovers that what appear to be chance events in his life are controlled by a mysterious, powerful group. After an event not planned by these controllers occurs\u2014a romantic encounter with a dancer\u2014he struggles against their manipulation, despite their promise of a great future for him.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] on February 14, 2011, and was released in theaters in the United States on March 4. It received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed $127 million, against a production budget of $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD MORE DETAIL TO THIS SUMMARY, but instead adjust what is already present. Plot summaries should be a maximum of 700 words according to WP:FILMPLOT; this summary in preview form is a little more than 600 words as of July 28, 2012. -->\nIn 2006, [[Brooklyn]] [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the [[United States Senate]]. While rehearsing his concession speech, he meets Elise Sellas, and they share a passionate kiss. David does not get Elise's name before they are separated, but, inspired by her, he delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received and makes him a favorite for the next Senate election.\n\nA month later, Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from Richardson at [[Madison Square Park]], which is near David's home. He is supposed to spill coffee on David's shirt by 7:05&nbsp;a.m., forcing David to go home to change, but he falls asleep, so David catches his intended bus to his new job and meets Elise again. Before she gets off the bus, David gets her name and phone number.\n\nDavid arrives at work before he was supposed to and finds his coworkers frozen and being examined by unfamiliar men, Richardson among them. He attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. After some debate about what to do, Richardson reveals to David the existence of the \"Adjustment Bureau\", an organization that ensures people's lives proceed according to \"the Plan\" created by \"the Chairman\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.kansascity.com/2011/03/03/2694442/the-adjustment-bureau-damon-and.html|title ='Adjustment Bureau': The surreal feels real|publisher = [[The Kansas City Star]]|quote=Are you angels?\u201d he asks Richardson. \u201cWe\u2019ve been called lots of things,\u201d is the reply. \u201cThink of us as case workers.\u201d|access-date = October 18, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://frontrow.dmagazine.com/2011/03/matt-damon-defies-gods-insidious-bureaucracy-in-the-adjustment-bureau/|title =Matt Damon Defies God's Insidious Bureaucracy in The Adjustment Bureau |publisher = [[D Magazine]]|quote=You see, \"the Chairman\" (as the film calls the being who manages the entire universe) has dispatched \"case workers\" to keep humanity moving according to his carefully choreographed plan.|access-date = October 18, 2007}}</ref> He says David was not supposed to see Elise a second time, so he destroys the card with her phone number on it, and then he releases David, warning him that his memory and personality will be erased if he tells anyone about what he has learned.\n\nThree years later, David spots Elise on the street. He gets off the bus and invites her to lunch, but Richardson interrupts them with reminders that David is scheduled to announce he is running for another Senate seat. Richardson tries to prevent David and Elise from reuniting, but David stubbornly persists and outruns Richardson to Elise's rehearsal with [[Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet]], even though members of the Bureau have a way to [[Teleportation|teleport]] using ordinary doorways.\n\nRichardson learns that David and Elise keep crossing paths because of remnants from earlier versions of the Plan in which they were meant to be together, and Thompson, a senior official in the Bureau, takes over David's case. He brings David back to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path through life, but Thompson says humans only have the appearance of [[free will]], as the Bureau's experiments with withdrawing their influence resulted in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] and the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century, respectively. Thompson tells David that being with Elise will keep him from his fate of becoming [[President of the United States]], and being with David will keep Elise from becoming a world-famous dancer and [[choreographer]]. To prove he is serious, Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle, and David abandons her at the hospital to avoid ruining their futures.\n\nEleven months later, Charlie, David's campaign manager and lifelong best friend, alerts David to Elise's imminent wedding. Harry surreptitiously arranges to meet with David when it is raining, since water prevents the Bureau from tracking people. As David's \"caseworker\", Harry feels guilty about all of the negative things he has helped to make happen to David in support of the Plan, so he teaches David how to use doors to teleport and, hopefully, reach Elise before the Bureau can stop him. David finds Elise just before the wedding and tells her about the Bureau, proving what he says by teleporting with her. Agents of the Bureau pursue them all over New York City, and, eventually, David decides to try to plead his case directly to the Chairman. Elise chooses to accompany him, and they enter the Bureau's headquarters. Chased to the [[30 Rockefeller Plaza#Observation deck|roof]] and surrounded, David and Elise declare their love and kiss. When they let go of each other, they are alone. Thompson appears, but he is interrupted by Harry, who presents the Chairman's newly-revised Plan for David and Elise, which is blank going forward. Harry commends David and Elise for their devotion and sends them away, speculating that the Chairman's true \"plan\" may be for people to fight for their free will and write their own destinies, like David and Elise did.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- first 9 in the same order as the main credits, the rest in the same order as the scrolling credits (which are \"in order of appearance\") -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Matt Damon]] as David Norris\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Elise Sellas\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Harry Mitchell\n* [[John Slattery]] as Richardson\n* [[Michael Kelly (actor)|Michael Kelly]] as Charlie Traynor\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Thompson\n* [[Donnie Keshawarz]] as Donaldson\n* [[Anthony Ruivivar]] as McCrady\n* David Bishins as Burdensky\n* [[Amanda Warren]] as Senior Campaign Aide\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Brooklyn Ice House Bartender\n* [[Pedro Pascal]] as Maitre D' Paul De Santo\n* [[Brian Haley]] as Police Officer Maes\n* Jessica Lee Keller as Lauren, Elise's Best Friend\n* [[Shane McRae]] as Adrian Troussant, Elise's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[David Alan Basche]] as Thompson\u2019s Aide\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Chuck Scarborough]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], [[James Carville]], [[Mary Matalin]], and [[Betty Liu]] appear as themselves.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nIn early drafts of the script, the character of Norris was changed from a real-estate salesman, as in [[Philip K.
