Her parents and two siblings were murdered when she was nine.\n\nOrphaned, she lives in Bucharest with her aunt Astrid who owns a chocolate store. Astrid is the former mate of the werewolf pack leader Gabriel who, in accordance with pack law, leaves her after seven years for a new mate. Once in a while he returns to sleep with Astrid, who remains painfully in love with him. Vivian is disgusted but Gabriel wants her as his mate, believing her to be the prophesied woman to bring about a \"new age of hope\" for the pack.\n\nVivian begins a romantic relationship with graphic novelist Aiden who is researching werewolves. Aiden has fled America where he is wanted for assaulting his father. Vivian does not reveal that she is a werewolf.\n\nTheir romance is monitored by Gabriel's son Rafe and his friends Ulf, Gregor, Finn, and Willem, together known as the \"Five\". Rafe is angry with Gabriel for leaving his mother, Astrid, and with Vivian due to Gabriel's intentions towards her. Seeing a drawing Aiden has done of Vivian calling her \"Wolf Girl\", he tells Rafe she may be a danger to the pack. Gabriel tells Rafe to make Aiden leave the city or he will die.\n\nIn an abandoned church Rafe fails to scare Aiden away and attacks him. He changes into a wolf and, attempting to bite Aiden, he bites into Aiden's silver pendant and quickly backs off. Aiden, realizing the werewolf myths are real, charges at Rafe holding the silver pendant and both fall from the balcony to the church floor. Regaining consciousness, Aiden sees Rafe dying in human form, with the silver pendant stuck in his neck. Grabbing his pendant, Aiden leaves the church.\n\nAiden confronts Vivian, daring her to hold the silver pendant. He tells her he killed Rafe and berates her for not confiding the truth and exposing him to danger. The Five discover Rafe's body in the church and take him to Gabriel, who breaks the news to Astrid while Vivian watches. Aiden is captured trying to leave the city.\n\nIn the forest Gabriel presents Aiden to the pack as their prey, telling Aiden he will be free if he makes it to the river at the edge of the forest. Vivian escapes her confinement and runs into the forest as a wolf to save Aiden. Aiden makes it to the river. Gabriel attempts to follow to kill him anyway but Vivian fights Gabriel, who falls into the river. Not recognizing Vivian in wolf form, Aiden stabs her with a silver knife. Vivian starts to bleed, slowly morphing back to human form. She needs an antidote to silver poisoning quickly or she will die.\n\nVivian takes Aiden to an abandoned film company building, telling Aiden the residual silver from the film guarantees no one will look for them there. She tells him of her guilt that her family was killed by hunters who followed her wolf tracks to their cabin. Aiden says she can control the wolf. Astrid arrives with a gun to kill Aiden; Vivian pleads with her, saying she should understand what it's like to lose a soulmate. Astrid relents and gives Vivian the gun. Vivian tells Astrid they will get the antidote from the pharmacist and then leave the city.\n\nThe pharmacist gives Vivian the antidote but also alerts Gabriel. Vivian tells Aiden to save himself and is captured by the pack. Aiden forces the pharmacist at gun point to give him all of his antidotes, silver dust, and silver bullets. He rescues Vivian, who kills Gabriel and helps the Five escape the now burning building, telling them \"may you know the new age of hope when you see it\".\n\nThey take Gabriel's car out of the city towards Paris, passing other werewolves who stop along the side of the road and bare their necks in respect, which identifies Vivian (and Aiden) as the new Alpha pair for the pack.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Agnes Bruckner]] as Vivian Gandillon\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Aiden\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as Gabriel\n* [[Katja Riemann]] as Astrid\n* [[Bryan Dick]] as Rafe\n* [[Chris Geere]] as Ulf\n* [[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]] as Gregor\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Finn\n* Jack Wilson as Willem\n* Vitalie Ursu as Constani\n* Bogdan Voda as Albu\n* [[Kata Dob\u00f3]] as Beatrice\n* [[Maria Dinulescu]] as Girl in Red\n* Mihai Gruia Sandu as Pharmacist\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBeginning in 1997, a series of five directors entered into talks to direct ''Blood & Chocolate'' before Katja von Garnier finally decided to work on the film in January 2005. Larry Williams and his wife, [[Leslie Libman]], [[Po-Chih Leong]], [[Sanji Senaka]], and [[Rupert Wainwright]] were all considered. Throughout these talks, ''Blood and Chocolate'' author, [[Annette Curtis Klause]], was not kept up-to-date by the film's producers. Rather, she obtained information about film's progression from online sources.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2006/01/author-update-annette-curtis-klause.html | title = Interview with author Annette Curtis Klause | access-date = October 3, 2006 | archive-date = July 8, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708032643/http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2006/01/author-update-annette-curtis-klause.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe book was originally adapted into a script by [[Christopher Landon (filmmaker)|Christopher Landon]], whose father, [[Michael Landon]], had a leading role in the film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://katja-von-garnier.de/deutsch/film_blood_and_chocolate.htm | title = ''Blood and Chocolate'' at director's site (de icon) }}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] was set in the historic section of Bucharest and at [[MediaPro Studios]] in [[Buftea]]. However, the film failed to accurately represent the city of Bucharest. For example, the film's [[Piata Romana]] (Romana Square) is actually the [[Curtea Veche]] yard (Old Court), and the film's Biserica Silvestru (Silvestru Church, located in downtown Bucharest) is actually a church in Stirbey Palace, Buftea, which is located tens of kilometers west of Bucharest.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Blood & Chocolate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nThe [[Film score|film's score]] was composed by [[Reinhold Heil]] and [[Johnny Klimek]].
