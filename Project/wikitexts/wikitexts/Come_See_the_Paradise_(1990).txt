Set before and during [[World War II]], the film depicts the treatment of [[Japanese American]]s in the [[United States]] following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], and the subsequent loss of [[civil liberties]] within the framework of a love story.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1950s, Lily Kawamura tells her pre-adolescent daughter Mini about her father and the life that she barely remembers, as the two of them are walking to a rural train station.\n\nIn 1936, Jack McGurn is a [[motion picture]] [[projectionist]], involved in a campaign of harassment against non-[[Trade union|union]] theaters in [[New York City]].  One such attack turns fatal, as one of his fellow union members starts a fire.  McGurn's boss, knowing that the feelings of guilt would likely cause Jack to go to the police, urges him to leave the city. Jack moves to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] where his brother Gerry lives.  Jack's role as a \"[[sweatshop]] [[Labour law|lawyer]]\" strains an already-rocky relationship with Gerry who is willing to have any job, barely keeping his family afloat during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nTaking the name McGann, Jack finds a job as a non-union projectionist in a movie theater run by a [[Japanese American]] family by the name of Kawamura. He falls in love with Lily, his boss' daughter. Forbidden to see one another by her [[Issei]] parents and banned from marrying by [[California]] law, the couple [[Elopement (marriage)|elopes]] to [[Seattle]], where they marry and have a daughter, Mini.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, Lily and their daughter are caught up in the [[Japanese American internment]], rounded up and sent to [[Manzanar]], California.  Jack, away on a trip, is [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] with no chance to help his family prepare for their imprisonment.\n\nFinally visiting the camp, he arranges a private meeting with his wife's father, telling him that he has gone [[AWOL]] and wants to stay with them, whatever they have to go through.  They are ''his'' family now and he belongs with them.  The older man counsels him to return to the Army, and says that he now believes that Jack is truly in love with Lily, and a worthy husband.\n\nReturning, ready to face his punishment for desertion, he is met by FBI agents, who have identified \"McGann\" as being the McGurn wanted for his part in the arson of years before.\n\nFinally, in the 1950s, the train arrives and Lily and Mini reunite with Jack, who has served his time in prison and is now returning to his family.\n\n==Title==\nThe title of the film is inspired by a line of the short poem ''\"I Hear The Oriole's Always-Grieving Voice\"'' by Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], which ends with the following lines:\n {{blockquote| \nI don't expect love's tender flatteries,<br>\nIn premonition of some dark event,<br>\nBut come, come and see this paradise<br>\nWhere together we were blessed and innocent.}}\n\nWriter Alan Parker was unable to locate Akhmatova's original poem and wrote his own poem before writing the script to try and say what the film would say:<ref>From the DVD - The Making of the Film, Last Words, essay by Sir Alan Parker.</ref>\n{{blockquote|\nWe all dream our American dreams<br>\nWhen we're awake and when we sleep<br>\nSo much hope that grief belies<br>\nFar beyond the lies and sighs<br>\nBecause dreams are free<br>\nAnd so are we<br>\nCome See the Paradise}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack McGurn / McGann\n* [[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Lily Yuriko Kawamura / McGann\n* [[Sab Shimono]] as Hiroshi Kawamura\n* [[Shizuko Hoshi]] as Mrs. Kawamura\n* Darren Cram as Military Police #2\n* Stan Egi as Charlie Kawamura\n* Ronald Yamamoto as Harry Kawamura\n* Akemi Nishino as Dulcie Kawamura\n* Naomi Nakano as Joyce Kawamura\n* Brady Tsurutani as Frankie Kawamura\n* Elizabeth Gilliam as Younger Mini McGann\n* Shyree Mezick as Middle-aged Mini McGann\n* Caroline Junko King as Older Mini McGann\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Augie Farrell\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Gerry McGurn\n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Marge McGurn\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was well received, and on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the rating was a 'fresh' 64%.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=come_see_the_paradise|title=Come See The Paradise}}.

The identification is based on various elements calculated to be likely to draw Oscar nominations, including the previous nominations of Parker, the film's setting in Hollywood (including Quaid's projectionist character), and its depiction of a tragic historical event against the background of war and [[racism]]. It was only released in a few cities during the last week of that year to make it eligible for the awards. However, it was not nominated for any Oscars and failed at the box office.<ref>{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Joshua|title=The Most (and Least) Oscar-Bait-y Movies Ever, According to Science|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/15/oscar_bait_study_ucla_social_scientist_study_keywords_and_other_factors.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=January 15, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Home video releases==\nThe VHS tape was released June 12, 1991.
