It is based on the book ''Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway'' by the band's lead vocalist [[Cherie Currie]]. The film stars [[Dakota Fanning]] as Currie, [[Kristen Stewart]] as rhythm guitarist and vocalist [[Joan Jett]], and [[Michael Shannon]] as record producer [[Kim Fowley]]. ''The Runaways'' depicts the formation of the band in 1975 and focuses on the relationship between Currie and Jett until Currie's departure from the band. The film grossed around $4.6 million worldwide and received generally favorable reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Cherie Currie]] is a teenager in Los Angeles who desperately wants to be a [[rock and roll|rock star]]. She idolizes [[David Bowie]] and cuts her hair and dons make-up so she will resemble Bowie's character [[Aladdin Sane]]. At her high school talent show, she [[lip sync]]s to \"[[Lady Grinning Soul]]\" and wins, despite some hecklers in the audience.\n\n[[Joan Jett]] is a teenager who also dreams of rock stardom. At a club one night, she meets record producer [[Kim Fowley]] and talks about starting an all-girl rock band. Kim is interested. He introduces Joan to [[Sandy West]], a drummer. Joan and Sandy become friends and start jamming when Kim suggests that they recruit an attractive blonde in the vein of [[Brigitte Bardot]].\n\nKim and Joan comb Los Angeles' clubs to look for attractive blondes and discover Cherie. They invite her to audition at a trailer park in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and to prepare a [[Suzi Quatro]] song to perform at her audition. Cherie learns [[Peggy Lee]]'s \"[[Fever (Little Willie John song)|Fever]]\" instead and goes to audition, but the band is disappointed at her choice. Kim and Joan then write \"[[Cherry Bomb (The Runaways song)|Cherry Bomb]]\" on the spot for Cherie to audition with. Cherie sings the song and becomes part of the band, named the Runaways, joined by [[Lita Ford]] on lead guitar and Robin on bass. Joan and Cherie share a passionate kiss (but what follows between them is not explicit).\n\nThe Runaways are soon signed to [[Mercury Records]] and release an album. On account of the album's success, they travel to Japan to play a concert. Following their performance, Lita throws magazines at Cherie because they have pictures of Cherie only. Cherie is shocked because she thought the articles were to cover the whole band. As Lita, Cherie and Joan argue, overenthusiastic fans break through the window and chase the girls out of the building. Cherie's drug use worsens, until she [[overdose]]s in the hotel elevator and is sent to the hospital. Upon arriving back in the United States, Cherie begins to abuse her alcoholic father's painkiller medication.\n\nAt the studio recording their next album, Cherie has a [[mental breakdown]] and refuses to play after reading a cruel comment about her by Kim in a magazine article. Lita then rudely insults Cherie for being more popular than the rest of them; Cherie insists that she never asked for it. Kim orders Cherie to get in the booth and sing and Lita continues insulting her. Though Joan defends her, Cherie angrily quits the band and leaves the studio. Joan is outraged, and the Runaways are finished. Cherie returns home while Joan starts her own band, [[Joan Jett#Joan Jett & the Blackhearts|Joan Jett and the Blackhearts]]. Cherie collapses again in a phone booth in an abandoned parking lot after attempting to buy cheap liquor for herself. At the hospital, her twin sister [[Marie Currie]] visits her and orders her to straighten herself up.\n\nA few years later, Cherie is working in a local bakery and hears Joan's cover of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" on the radio and calls the station, where Joan is visiting for an interview. After an awkward conversation between Joan, Cherie, and radio host [[Rodney Bingenheimer]], Cherie says her goodbyes and continues working, smiling when Joan's next song, \"[[Crimson and Clover]]\", comes on the radio.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Floria Sigismondi, Cherie Currie, Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart.jpg|thumb|(Left to right) Floria Sigismondi, Cherie Currie, Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart]]\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as [[Cherie Currie]]\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Joan Jett]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[Kim Fowley]]\n* [[Riley Keough]] as [[Marie Currie]]\n* [[Stella Maeve]] as [[Sandy West]]\n* [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] as [[Lita Ford]]\n* [[Johnny Lewis]] as Scottie\n* [[Alia Shawkat]] as Robin Robins (actual bassist [[Jackie Fox|Jacqueline Fuchs]], by then an attorney in the entertainment field, chose not to release her rights<ref name=\"Davis Nylon Insider\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&parid=4092 |title=The Insider \u2013 Alia Shawkat |work=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]] |first=Rebecca |last=Davis |date=January 20, 2010 |access-date=June 18, 2010 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226120625/http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&parid=4092 |archive-date=December 26, 2010}}</ref>)\n* [[Hannah Marks]] as Tammy, Joan's friend\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as [[Rodney Bingenheimer]]\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as [[Marie Harmon]], a singer and Cherie's mother\n* [[Brett Cullen]] as Don Currie, Cherie's father\n* [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Derek\n* [[Robert Romanus]] as the guitar teacher\n* [[Nick Eversman]] as Ricky\n\n==Production==\nMusic video director [[Floria Sigismondi]] made her feature film directorial debut with ''The Runaways''.
