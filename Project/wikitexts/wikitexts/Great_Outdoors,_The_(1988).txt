It tells the story of two families spending their week-long vacation at a lake resort in the fictional town of Pechoggin, [[Wisconsin]] with hilarious outcomes. Aykroyd, Candy, and Young reprise their roles from Hughes' previous film, ''[[She's Having a Baby]]''.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nChicagoan Chester \"Chet\" Ripley, his wife Connie, and their two sons Buckley \"Buck\" and Ben are spending a week vacationing at a lake resort in Pechoggin, [[Wisconsin]], for the summer. They get their cabin from its owner Wally. All goes as planned until Connie's sister Kate, her investment broker husband Roman Craig, and their twin daughters Mara and Cara unexpectedly arrive uninvited.\n\nGhost stories after the family BBQ include one of a man-eating [[grizzly bear]] that Chet met directly when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from then on, it was known as the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" of Clare County.\n\nAfter Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat a 96-ounce steak called \"the Old 96'er\" at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him.\n\nConnie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's feelings of loneliness with Roman despite their wealth. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, Roman tells of the time at his and Kate's wedding when he overheard a conversation between Chet and their father-in-law describing how they think Roman is a crooked businessman. Roman then tells Chet why he came up to visit: to offer Chet a $25,000 investment opportunity. Feeling guilty from the wedding story, Chet is initially reluctant, but eventually agrees to write Roman a check for the whole amount.\n\nThe families say their goodbyes and Roman and his family head back to Chicago. On the car ride home, Kate praises Roman for including Chet in the investment, noting that $25,000 is a lot of money for Chet's family to part with. Now feeling guilty himself, Roman halts the car and returns to the cabin.\n\nUpon his return, Roman confesses that the story about the wedding conversation never happened and that he is broke from some failed investments. His true intention for coming up to the lake was to solicit money from Chet to financially recover.\n\nDuring a thunderstorm, Kate discovers the twins have gone missing. Chet and Roman find them at the bottom of an old mine shaft, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny space. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman reluctantly climbs down into the mine, while Chet searches for a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and escapes the shaft on his own.\n\nUpon returning with the rope, Chet is horrified to discover the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" lurking in the mine. It chases him back to the cabin, smashes through the door, and rampages through the house. Wally bursts in with a loaded shotgun lamp while Roman tries to hold off the animal with a fireplace poker and an oar. Chet takes the shotgun lamp and shoots the bear, blowing the fur off its rear. Roaring in pain, the bear runs out of the house making painful noises.\n\nThe next morning, the families part on amicable terms. Cammie accepts Buck's apologies and they end their brief romance. When Chet wonders what Roman meant by he'll see him soon, Connie states that she invited the Craigs to stay with them until they can recover. The Ripleys return to Chicago as Chet plans to beat Roman to their house first.\n\nDuring the credits, a deleted scene shows Chet, Connie, Roman, Kate, and Wally in a bar dancing to \"[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]\".\n\nIn a post-credits scene, three members of the [[raccoon]] family (who rummaged through the trash cans throughout the film) talk in their language about \"Jody\" sitting in the lake. One of them learns about what happened and another one states that she is now \"bald on both ends\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:John Candy and Dan Aykroyd during production of The Great Outdoors.jpg|thumb|[[John Candy]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] during production of ''The Great Outdoors'' in October 1987]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Roman Craig, a supposed investment broker\n* [[John Candy]] as Chester \"Chet\" Ripley, the patriarch of his family\n* [[Stephanie Faracy]] as Connie Ripley, Chet's wife and Kate's older sister\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Kate \"Katie\" Craig, Roman's wife and Connie's younger sister\n* [[Chris Young (actor)|Chris Young]] as Buckley \"Buck\" Ripley, Chet and Connie's older son\n* [[Lucy Deakins]] as Cammie, a local girl and waitress who Buck develops a crush on\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Wally, the owner of the cabin that the Ripleys and the Craigs stay in\n* Ian Giatti as Benjamin \"Benny\" Ripley, Chet and Connie's younger son\n* Hilary Gordon and Rebecca Gordon as Cara and Mara Craig, Roman and Kate's twin daughters\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as a waitress\n* [[John Bloom (actor)|John Bloom]] as Jimbo\n* [[Lewis Arquette]] as Herm\n* [[Britt Leach]] as Reg, a man who has been struck by lightning 66 times, then 67 near the end of the film\n* [[Bart the Bear]] as Jody the Bald-Headed Bear, a grizzly bear who lost her fur on top of its head during a previous encounter with Chet.
