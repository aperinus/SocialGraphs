It was followed by two sequels, also made by Berlinger and Sinofsky, which followed the evolution of the case through the years: ''[[Paradise Lost 2: Revelations]]'' in 2000, and  ''[[Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Description==\nThe film documents the events following the arrests of Misskelley, Echols and Baldwin for the murders of Christopher Byers, Michael Moore and Stevie Branch, whose naked and [[hogtied]] bodies were discovered in a ditch in a wooded area of [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]], Arkansas, known as \"Robin Hood Hills\".\n\nFilmmakers [[Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky]] interviewed numerous people connected with the case, including the parents of the victims, the parents of the accused, members of the West Memphis Police Department (WMPD) and all the defendants involved in the trial. Berlinger and Sinofsky are not filmed themselves, and the dialogue is provided by the interviewee, rather than using a \"Q & A\" format.\n\nThe film starts with an introduction to the case, before moving on to the arrests of the three teenagers. Much of the community, including the detectives and the victims' parents, believe the murders were committed by the teenagers as part of a [[Black Mass|Satanic ritual]]. During the trial, Damien Echols is asked about his familiarity with [[Aleister Crowley]]'s belief system. Echols also states that he likes reading books by [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Stephen King]].\n\nThe community is shown to be [[politically conservative]] and strongly [[Evangelical Christian]]. Because Misskelley had provided police with a confession, his trial is separated from that of Damien and Jason, and is covered in the first half of the film.\n\n==Trials coverage==\nThe first trial to be covered in the film is that of Misskelley, a trial which was severed from those of Echols and Baldwin since it was Misskelley who confessed. Emphasis is placed on the fact that there is a strong possibility that the confession was [[coerce]]d. Interviews are conducted with Misskelley himself, his family and friends, and his attorney Dan Stidham. Misskelley is sentenced to life in prison.\n\nPart two of the film documents the trials of Echols and Baldwin. Like the coverage of Misskelley's trial, there are interviews with both defendants, their attorneys and their families. The families of the victims also share their views.\n\nDuring the course of filming, [[John Mark Byers]], the stepfather of one of the victims (Christopher Byers), gave the filmmakers a knife which had blood in the hinge. The filmmakers turned the knife over to police, who examined it; the [[DNA]] was similar to that of Mark Byers and Christopher, but the evidence was nonetheless inconclusive since the DNA evidence produced was fragmented and could not provide concrete links.\n\n==Production==\nThe production had 79 filming days over a 10-month period, starting in the weeks after the murders through the trials and convictions, at the actual Arkansas locations.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117293/ | title=Paradise Lost: The Child Murders At Robin Hood Hills |publisher=[[imdb.com]] | year=2010  | access-date = 2010-11-24}}</ref> The movie marks the first time [[Metallica]] allowed their music to be used in a movie.<ref name=\"Metallica\"/> A decade later, the directors made ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]'' about Metallica.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632489/20100223/story.jhtml | title='Paradise Lost' Team Plans Two More West Memphis Three Documentaries |publisher=[[MTV]] | date=Feb 23, 2010  | access-date = 2010-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie was well received by critics, including [[Roger Ebert]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/paradise-lost-the-child-murders-at-robin-hood-hills-1996 | title=Paradise Lost: The Child Murders At Robin Hood Hills\n |publisher=[[Chicago Sun Times]] | date=September 27, 1996  | first=Roger | last=Ebert | access-date = 2013-07-18}}</ref> The film was followed by two sequels. First ''[[Paradise Lost 2: Revelations]]'' (2000), which suggests that further evidence was missed or suppressed and attempts to prove Echols' innocence. Followed by ''[[Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory]]'' (2011), which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating of 100%]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Paradise Lost: Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paradise_lost_child_murders_at_robin_hood_hills/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing a successful decision in 2010 by the Arkansas Supreme Court regarding recently uncovered DNA evidence, the West Memphis Three reached a deal with prosecutors. On August 19, 2011, they entered [[Alford plea]]s, which allow them to assert their innocence and were sentenced to time served, effectively freeing them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n*''[[West of Memphis]]'' \u2013 a 2012 documentary also covering the West Memphis Three\n*''[[Devil's Knot (film)|Devil's Knot]]'' \u2013 a 2013 feature film dramatization of the case, directed by [[Atom Egoyan]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0117293}}\n*{{curlie|Arts/Movies/Titles/P/Paradise_Lost_Movies/|''Paradise Lost'' movies}}\n\n{{West Memphis Three}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky}}\n{{Metallica}}\n{{HBO documentaries}}\n\n[[Category:1996 documentary films]]\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about crime in the United States]]\n[[Category:Emmy Award-winning programs]]\n[[Category:Films about miscarriage of justice]]\n[[Category:Films set in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:HBO documentary films]]\n[[Category:Murder in Arkansas]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award-winning broadcasts]]\n[[Category:Metallica]]\n[[Category:West Memphis Three]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce Sinofsky]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joe Berlinger]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joe Berlinger]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
