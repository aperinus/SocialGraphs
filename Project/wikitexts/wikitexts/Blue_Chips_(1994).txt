His players were portrayed by actors as well as real-life basketball stars [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway|Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway]] and cameos include noted basketball figures [[Bob Knight]], [[Rick Pitino]], [[George Raveling]], [[Bob Cousy]], [[Larry Bird]], [[Jerry Tarkanian]], [[Matt Painter]], [[Allan Houston]], [[Dick Vitale]], [[Jim Boeheim]], [[Dan Dakich]] and [[Bobby Hurley]], as well as actor [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]\n\n==Plot==\nPete Bell, a [[college basketball]] coach for the Western University Dolphins in Los Angeles, is under a lot of pressure. His team is not winning as often as it once did and his successful program needs to attract new star players. But the brightest stars of the future\u2014the so-called \"blue-chip\" prospects\u2014are secretly being paid by other schools.\n\nThis practice is forbidden in the college game, but Pete is desperate after a losing season. A school booster, greedy \"friend of the program\" Happy, will stop at nothing to land these star high school players for Western's next season and gets the okay from the coach to do so. This includes offering a new car to the gigantic Neon Boudeaux (Shaq), a house and job to the mother of Butch McRae, and a tractor to the father of farmboy Ricky Roe, as well as a bag filled with cash.\n\nWith sportswriter Ed suspecting a scandal, Pete continues to be contaminated by demands from the players and a dirty association with the booster. His estranged wife, a former guidance counselor, agrees to tutor Neon, who has below average grades, but she feels betrayed when Pete lies to her about the new athletes receiving illegal inducements to attend the school.\n\nPete comes to realize that one of his senior players, Tony, a personal favorite, had \"[[point shaving|shaved points]]\" in a game his freshman season, conspiring to beat a gambling point spread after carefully reviewing a video of the freshman season game depicting Tony's unusual behavior. Pete is disgusted at what he and his program have become.\n\nWestern University has a big nationally televised game coming up versus Indiana, the #1 team in the country, coached by [[Bobby Knight]]. After winning the game, Pete cannot bear the guilt of having cheated. At a press conference, he confesses to the entire scandal and resigns as head coach. Leaving the press conference and the arena, Pete walks past a small playground with kids playing basketball\u2014he approaches, then helps coaching them.\n\nAn epilogue later reveals that the university would be suspended from tournament play for three years. Pete did continue to coach, but at the high school level; Tony graduated and played pro ball in Europe; Ricky Roe got injured and returned home to run the family farm, and Neon and Butch dropped out of college, but both now play in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Coach Pete Bell\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Jenny Bell\n* [[J.

Knight appears in the film as himself but has no scripted lines.\n\nFrench Lick is the hometown of [[Larry Bird]], who plays a scene with Nolte at the outdoor court of Bird's home. This was actually the same court (located on the property that Bird had purchased in the early 1980s) that was used in a [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] television commercial in 1984 starring Bird and [[Magic Johnson]].\n\nIn a scene showing Nolte driving to French Lick, local radio station WSLM 98.9 FM can be heard in the car. In the final version, this scene was edited out.\n\n''Blue Chips'' features several famous players and coaches playing themselves, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], [[Rick Pitino]], [[Matt Painter]], and [[Jim Boeheim]] among them. Legendary [[Boston Celtics]] point guard and [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] member [[Bob Cousy]] has a role as the athletic director of the college where Pete Bell is coach.\n\n''Blue Chips'' was Friedkin's first film for [[Paramount Pictures]] since 1977's ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', the production of which had strained his relationship with the studio for years. His next three films would also be released by Paramount. Some attributed this to his relationship with the head of Paramount [[Sherry Lansing]].<ref>Friedkin p.409</ref>\n\nFilming alongside Hardaway led O'Neal to recommend to the [[Orlando Magic]] that they select Hardaway \u2013 which they eventually did at the [[1993 NBA Draft]] when they traded No. 1 overall pick [[Chris Webber]] to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for Hardaway and three future first-round draft picks. With both on their roster, the Magic recorded the best record in the Eastern Conference in the 1994-95 regular season and made the first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history.\n\nAl Hoffman was Nolte's stand-in for the Indiana and Chicago portions of the film.\n\nThe pep band that performed in the film was composed of students from Lafayette Jefferson High School, Frankfort High School and a small number of local professionals under the direction of Jeff Parthun.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned mixed reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Blue Chips|publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940218/REVIEWS/402180301/1023|access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Review/Film; Of Dunkers and Dollars|work= [[The New York Times]]|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E3DB143BF93BA25751C0A962958260|access-date=2012-06-01}}</ref> Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' panned the film, writing, \"The ostensible subject here is the big business of college athletics, and, just as ''[[The Program (1993 film)|The Program]]'' tried to do with [[college football]], the film's purpose is to expose the corruption behind the scenes of so-called amateur athletics that have transformed the sport into a desperate money grab.  But, like ''The Program,'' this strident, unconvincing bit of movie muckraking uses our national sports mania to decoy us into sitting through a dreary lecture about ethics and moral corner-cutting.  What's most surprising here is that the assembled talent\u2014from the worlds of basketball and movies\u2014is so impressive and, still, the work is so tired. As the coach who exchanges his soul for a winning program, [[Nick Nolte]] struts and bellows in a desperate attempt to bring his character to life, and though he works up quite a lather, all he gets for the effort is sweat stains.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/bluechipspg13hinson_b00983.htm |last=Hinson |first=Hal |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=film review |date=February 19, 1994 |access-date=February 14, 2011 }}</ref> ''Blue Chips'' currently holds a 37% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 27 reviews.
