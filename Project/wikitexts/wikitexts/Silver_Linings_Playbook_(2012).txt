Russell]]. The film was based on [[Matthew Quick]]\u2019s 2008 novel ''[[The Silver Linings Playbook]]''. It stars [[Bradley Cooper]] and [[Jennifer Lawrence]], with [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jacki Weaver]], [[Chris Tucker]], [[Anupam Kher]], [[John Ortiz]] and [[Julia Stiles]] in [[Supporting actor|supporting]] roles.\n\nThe story takes place in [[Ridley Park]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Cooper plays Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Jr., a man with [[bipolar disorder]] who is released from a [[psychiatric hospital]] and moves back in with his parents (De Niro and Weaver). Pat is determined to win back his estranged wife. He meets a young widow, Tiffany Maxwell (Lawrence), who offers to help him get his wife back if he enters a dance competition with her. The two become closer as they train, and Pat, his father, and Tiffany examine their relationships with each other as they cope with their personal situations.\n\n''Silver Linings Playbook'' premiered at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2012, and was released in the United States on November 16, 2012.<ref name=\"ReleaseDates\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045658/releaseinfo|title=Release dates for ''Silver Linings Playbook''|work=IMDb|access-date=September 27, 2012|archive-date=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701070823/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045658/releaseinfo|url-status=live}}</ref> The film opened to significant critical acclaim, with praise drawn to Russell's direction, and the performances of Cooper and Lawrence.

His primary focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki. She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat found her in the shower with another man and badly beat him.\n\nDuring his time in the clinic, Pat befriended Danny McDaniels, an easygoing man who is embroiled in a legal dispute with the clinic over whether or not he is eligible to leave. Pat's therapist, Cliff Patel, tries to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: He attempts to see the good, or [[silver lining (idiom)|silver lining]]s, in all that he experiences. Pat employs the phrase \"[[wikt:excelsior|Excelsior]],\" or \"ever upward,\" as his new optimistic [[mantra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/24456|title=Silver Linings Playbook - Film Reviews - Films - Spirituality & Practice|website=www.spiritualityandpractice.com|access-date=November 13, 2018|archive-date=November 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113170027/https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/reviews/view/24456|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, Pat experiences a series of anxiety attacks, including a violent reaction to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', which he throws into the yard, destroying his bedroom window in the process.\n\nPat attends dinner at his best friend Ronnie's house and meets Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell, a widow with an unnamed disorder. They connect, talking about different [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] they have taken to manage their mental illnesses. Sparks fly between them, and she tries to offer him [[casual sex]], but Pat is focused on getting Nikki back. Trying to get closer to Pat, Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki if, in return, he partners with her in an upcoming dance competition. He agrees and they begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. When Danny comes to help, Pat starts to get jealous and shows Tiffany a bit of affection; however, he tries to push his feelings away. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki he has changed.\n\nThe elder Patrizio, hoping to open his own restaurant, has resorted to [[Bookmaker#Legality|illegal bookmaking]]. Having bet most of his money on a [[Philadelphia Eagles]] game, he asks Pat to attend for good luck. Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, which cautiously hints they may be able to reconcile. Before entering the stadium, Pat and his brother Jake get in a fight with some racist fans and are hauled away by the police. The Eagles lose the game, and Patrizio is furious.\n\nWhen Patrizio expresses that the Eagles lost because of Tiffany being involved in his son's life, Tiffany refutes his allegations by pointing out that the Philadelphia teams had done better whenever she and Pat were together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a [[parlay (gambling)|parlay]] with Randy: If the Eagles win their next game and Tiffany and Pat score five out of ten in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant, and Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade Pat to dance in the competition, telling him Nikki will be there. It is revealed that it was his mother's initiative to support Tiffany's attempts to befriend him. Pat notices that the letter from Nikki also refers to \"reading the signs\", a phrase frequently used by Tiffany during her just-concluded argument with his father. He realizes that Tiffany in fact wrote the letter.\n\nTiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she sees Nikki in the audience, invited by Ronnie and his wife Veronica. They want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give him the chance to reconcile. Tiffany starts to drink heavily at the bar. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat receive an average score of exactly 5.0 points, amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd.\n\nPat approaches Nikki and whispers into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him long to realize it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Jr., a former teacher and recent divorcee<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bradley-cooper-robert-de-niro-to-join-the-silver-linings-playbook |title=Bradley Cooper joining the ''Silver Linings Playbook''? |last=Wales |first=George |date=August 2, 2011 |work=TotalFilm.com |access-date=October 23, 2011 |archive-date=March 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308021533/http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bradley-cooper-robert-de-niro-to-join-the-silver-linings-playbook |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Cooper&DeNiro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2011/bradley-cooper-back-on-silver-linings-playbook-with-robert-de-niro |title=Bradley Cooper Back on ''Silver Linings Playbook'' with Robert De Niro |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |date=August 2, 2011 |work=FirstShowing.net |access-date=October 23, 2011 |archive-date=September 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917132303/https://www.firstshowing.net/2011/bradley-cooper-back-on-silver-linings-playbook-with-robert-de-niro/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Cooper&DeNiro2\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Tiffany Maxwell, a young widow<ref name=\"Lawrence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/The+Hunger+Games/articles/Ay30y_D9gMT/Jennifer+Lawrence+Star+Silver+Linings+Playbook |title=Jennifer Lawrence to Star in the ''Silver Linings Playbook'' |date=November 21, 2011 |work=Zimbio.com |access-date=October 23, 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225517/http://www.zimbio.com/The+Hunger+Games/articles/Ay30y_D9gMT/Jennifer+Lawrence+Star+Silver+Linings+Playbook |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Sr., Pat and Jake's father<ref name=\"Cooper&DeNiro\" /><ref name=\"Cooper&DeNiro2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/08/bradley-cooper-back-in-silver-linings-playbook-talks-robert-de-niro-too |title=Bradley Cooper Back In ''Silver Linings Playbook'' Talks, Robert DeNiro Too |last=Fleming |first=Mike |date=August 1, 2011 |work=Deadline.com |access-date=October 23, 2011 |archive-date=June 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616155029/http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/bradley-cooper-back-in-silver-linings-playbook-talks-robert-de-niro-too/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Dolores Solitano, Pat and Jake's mother<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-nominated-animal-kingdom-actress-240203 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |title=Oscar-Nominated 'Animal Kingdom' Actress in Talks to Join 'Silver Lining Playbook' |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=November 19, 2011 |first=Borys |last=Kit |archive-date=September 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917124448/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-nominated-animal-kingdom-actress-240203 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Cliff Patel, Pat's doctor and friend<ref name=\"Kher\">{{cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/132465888.html |title=Bollywood star steps out at Tashan |last=Klein |first=Michael |date=October 23, 2011 |work=Philly.com |access-date=October 23, 2011 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072640/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-insider/132465888.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Danny McDaniels, a good friend of Pat from the psychiatric hospital\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Veronica Maxwell, Tiffany's sister<ref>{{cite web |date=16 November 2020 |author=Marah Eakin |title=Julia Stiles would love a Ghostwriter do-over |url=https://www.avclub.com/julia-stiles-is-extremely-embarrassed-by-her-stint-on-1845662328 |website=[[The A.V.
