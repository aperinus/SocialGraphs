Prosperi]], with narration by [[Stefano Sibaldi]]. The film consists of a series of [[travel documentary|travelogue]] scenes that provide glimpses into cultural practices around the world with the intention to shock or surprise [[Western world|Western]] film audiences.<ref>Goodall, ''Sweet & Savage'', 22.</ref> These scenes are presented with little continuity, as they are intended as a kaleidoscopic display of shocking content rather than presenting a structured argument. Despite its claims of genuine documentation, certain scenes are either staged or creatively manipulated to enhance this effect.<ref>Kerekes and Slater, ''Killing for Culture'', 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nThe film was an international box-office success and inspired an entire genre of [[mondo film]]s in the form of [[exploitation film|exploitation]] documentaries, many of which also include the word ''mondo'' (meaning \"world\") in their title. The musical score by [[Riz Ortolani]] and [[Nino Oliviero]] gained considerable popularity outside of the film itself. Its main theme, \"[[More (Theme from Mondo Cane)|More]]\", won a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Grammy Award]] and earned an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], and was covered by such artists as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Andy Williams]], and [[Roy Orbison]].\n\n==Vignettes==\nDuring the opening credits, a dog is being dragged and kicked into a [[dog pound]] filled with barking dogs.\n\nA statue by Luigi Gheno is dedicated to [[Rudolph Valentino]] in his hometown of [[Castellaneta|Castellaneta, Italy]]. At the event the narrator points out similarities in some local men's faces to Valentino's.\n\nIn the United States, [[Rossano Brazzi]] has his shirt torn off by a crowd of female fans hunting for his autograph.\n\nAt the beach in [[Polyandry|polyandrous]] [[Kiriwina]], one of the [[Trobriand Islands]] in [[New Guinea]], a large crowd of topless native women run after a handful of men, trying to capture them \"not only for autographs\".\n\nOn the [[French Riviera]], a small group of blonde bikini-clad young women on a boat drive by a ship with U.S. sailors, \"wooing\" them teasingly from the distance by sending them kisses, showing their tongues and flaunting their breasts.\n\nIn a New Guinean [[Kuman language (New Guinea)|Chimbu]] community, a woman whose child was killed [[Breastfeeding|breastfeeds]] a [[Piglet (animal)|piglet]] whose mother died. Also in New Guinea, at a celebration that recurs every five years, in a matter of hours, dozens of pigs are slaughtered by beating on their heads with wooden poles, and eaten, after which the partly [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] community returns to its perpetual state of hunger. Dogs, however, are fed some of the pork and treated with affection and respect.\n\nAt the [[Pet Haven Cemetery]] in [[Pasadena, California]], dog owners mourn their departed beloveds.\n\nIn Formosa (aka [[Taipei|Taipei, Taiwan]]), dogs are grown, butchered and skinned for local [[dog meat]] gourmets.\n\nIn [[Rome]], hundreds of [[Chicken|chicks]] are tinged in many colors and then dried at 50 degrees Celsius to be included in [[Easter egg]]s; according to the narrator, of each 100 that undergo it, approximately 70 do not survive the procedure.\n\nFor [[foie gras]], geese in [[Strasbourg]] are force-fed using [[funnel]]s.\n\nIn a farm 200 miles from [[Tokyo]], [[Wagyu]] cattle are massaged and fed beer for three or four specialized restaurants in Tokyo and [[New York City|New York]].\n\nOn New Guinean [[Tabar Group|Tabar]], the most beautiful women are locked up in small wooden cages and fed [[tapioca]] until they reach 120 kilos to be offered as wives to the village dictator.\n\nIn a [[Vic Tanny]] health club in [[Los Angeles]], overweight women work on losing weight to recover from a previous marriage.\n\nAt a [[Hong Kong]] market, exotic animals are sold for food.\n\nAt the New York restaurant [[The Colony (restaurant)|The Colony]], canned exotic animals are served for rich Americans.\n\nAt a [[Singapore]] snake store, a snake is chosen and butchered for consumption.\n\nIn the Italian village of [[Cocullo]], on [[Saint Dominic]]'s day, the statue and its followers in the procession carry live snakes.\n\nIn [[Nocera Terinese]], on [[Good Friday]], each \u201cvattienti\" beats their legs with glass shards and spill their blood on the streets where the procession will take place.\n\nA parade of the \"[[Lifesaving|Life Savers]] Girls Association\", all from 16 to 20 years old, march toward the [[Sydney]] beach, where they put on a lifesaving show, including [[CPR]] on young men.\n\nDue to the nuclear contamination on [[Bikini Atoll]], swarms of dead butterflies drift at sea, birds hide in holes in the ground, a species of [[periophthalmus]] fish migrated to the trees, [[sea gull]]s brood over sterile eggs, and disoriented turtles move inland and die in the desert. Birds nest in turtles' skeletons.\n\nIn [[Malaysia]]n underwater cemeteries, [[shark]]s get accustomed to human flesh. Their fins are dried on the beach and collected by disabled fishermen, who sell them to the Chinese as [[aphrodisiac]]s. A 12-year-old Malaysian boy has been killed by sharks, and the fisherman exact revenge by shoving toxic [[sea urchin]]s into the mouths of sharks, releasing them again to slowly die.\n\nRome: In the [[Capuchin Crypt]], bones were arranged as ornaments, and on [[Tiber Island]], the [[:it:Sacconi Rossi|Sacconi Rossi]] (\"Red Sacks\") guard the bones of nameless victims of the past since around 1600, which on Fridays are cleaned by local families including children.\n\nOn the [[Reeperbahn]] in [[Hamburg]], people indulge life by drinking beer and suffer from the symptoms of [[hangover]]s in the morning. They sleep standing up, dance, [[Punch (combat)|brawl]], and fool around.\n\n[[Tokyo, Japan|Tokyo]] has a massage parlor for men who are drunk.\n\nIn [[Macao, China|Macao]], the dead are covered in make-up for the funeral.

Relatives await their demise by making merry at restaurants in the plaza nearby.\n\nCars are smashed at a junkyard of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and reduced to cubes. A cube of crushed car metal is sold as art in a [[Paris, France|Paris]] art gallery.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia, [[Yves Klein]] makes his paintings with the help of some female models and some musicians to express his favorite color, blue. (The artist had a heart attack while viewing the film at the Cannes Film Festival and died less than a month later.)\n\nIn [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], tourists are showered with [[lei (garland)|leis]] and witness the [[Hula Dance]].\n\nIn Nepal, [[Gurkha]] soldiers perform a rite of passage by dressing up in women's clothing on anniversary of the execution of 300 Gurkha [[POWs]] by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] during [[WWII]].\n\nGurkha soldiers behead buffalo bulls in a ritualistic contest of strength.\n\nIn Portugal, there is a morning [[running of the bulls]] for working-class citizens and an afternoon bull-taunting inside a stadium for noble-born men in formal costumes.\n\nAt [[Goroka, Papua New Guinea]], there are indigenous tribes who attend Catholic church services.\n\nThe film concludes with a \"[[cargo cult]]\" of indigenous people in mountains high above the airport in [[Port Moresby|Port Moresby, New Guinea]].  These people have erected icons of worship that resemble an airport runway, airplane, and control tower using [[bamboo shoots]].\n\n==Production==\nIn the beginning, as Cavara (who took the helm for European and Euro-Asiatic zone) and his supervisor Stanis Nievo' interviews revealed, ''Mondo Cane'' was a unique project conceived with ''La donna nel Mondo'', and worked at the same time (1960\u201362).<ref>See: ''[[La donna nel mondo]]''.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Mondo Cane'' was an international box-office success and inspired the production of numerous, similar [[exploitation film|exploitation]] documentaries, many of which also include the word \"Mondo\" in their title. These films collectively came to be recognized as a distinct [[film genre|genre]] known as [[mondo film]]s. In addition, the film's success led Jacopetti and Prosperi to produce several additional documentaries, including ''Mondo Cane 2'', ''[[Africa addio]]'' and ''[[Goodbye Uncle Tom|Addio zio Tom]]'', while Cavara directed ''[[La donna nel mondo]]'', ''Malamondo'', as well as the anti-Mondo [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Wild Eye]]'' (Occhio selvaggio).\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for two awards for the 1962 film season. It won the [[David di Donatello]] for Best Production (Migliore Produzione) by the Accademia del Cinema Italiano,<ref>{{cite web |title=Accademia del Cinema Italiano - Premi David di Donatello |url=http://www.daviddidonatello.it/cercafilmvincitori2.php?idfilm=332&vinfilm=mondo_cane |publisher=Accademia del Cinema Italiano |access-date=2010-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722031236/http://www.daviddidonatello.it/cercafilmvincitori2.php?idfilm=332&vinfilm=mondo_cane |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which it shared with ''[[A Difficult Life|Una vita difficile]]''. It was also nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the 15th [[Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1962/inCompetition.html |title=Festival de Cannes |publisher=Festival de Cannes |access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref> which it lost to ''[[O Pagador de Promessas]]''. The theme song, \"[[More (Theme from Mondo Cane)|More]]\", was written by [[Riz Ortolani]] and [[Nino Oliviero]], and was given new lyrics in [[English language|English]] by [[Norman Newell]]. In [[36th Academy Awards|1963]], the song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], where it lost to \"[[Call Me Irresponsible]]\" from the film ''[[Papa's Delicate Condition]]''.\n\n==Influence==\nThe film spawned several direct [[sequel]]s, starting with Jacopetti and Prosperi's own ''[[Mondo Cane 2]]'' (also known as ''Mondo Pazzo''), released the following year. Much later, in the 1980s, two more emerged: ''Mondo Cane Oggi: L'Orrore Continua'' and ''Mondo Cane 2000: L'Incredible''.<ref name=kerekesslater152153>Kerekes and Slater, ''Killing for Culture'', 152\u2013153.</ref> The films continued into the nineties with two follow-ups from German filmmaker Uwe Schier; despite the fact that they were the fifth and sixth installments, they were titled ''Mondo Cane IV'' and ''Mondo Cane V''.<ref name=kerekesslater157158>Kerekes and Slater, ''Killing for Culture'', 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nAs well as encouraging sequels, ''Mondo Cane''{{'s}} shock-exploitation-documentary-[[exquisite corpse]] style is credited with starting a whole genre: the [[mondo film]]. Examples include ''[[Mondo Bizarro (film)|Mondo Bizarro]]'', ''[[Mondo Daytona]]'', ''[[Mondo Freudo]]'' (1966), ''[[Mondo Mod]]'', ''[[Mondo Infame]]'', ''[[Mondo New York]]'', and ''[[Mondo Hollywood]]'';<ref name=kerekesslater107>Kerekes and Slater, ''Killing for Culture'', 107.</ref> later examples include the ''[[Faces of Death]]'' series.\n\nThe film also inspired lampooning, including ''[[Mr. Mike's Mondo Video]]'', written by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s [[Michael O'Donoghue]] and starring members of the contemporary cast of the  program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://letterboxd.com/film/mr-mikes-mondo-video/|title = Mr. Mike's Mondo Video (1979)}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Mike Patton]] released a musical album in tribute to the film, also called ''[[Mondo Cane (album)|Mondo Cane]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Goodall, Mark.
