Henson]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[Mark Wahlberg]], the film tells the story of a case of [[mistaken identity]] in New York City, which turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous.\n\n''Date Night'' premiered in New York City on April 6, 2010, and was released theatrically on April 9, 2010, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $152.3 million against a $55 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\nPhil and Claire Foster are a married couple from [[New Jersey]] with two children, Ollie and Charlotte, and whose domestic life has become boring and routine. Their sex life is perfunctory and demystified. Phil is a tax lawyer while Claire is a [[realtor]]. They are motivated to reignite their romance after learning that their best friends, Brad and Haley, are planning to divorce to escape the married-life routine and to have more excitement in their lives.\n\nTo avoid the routine that had become their weekly \"date night\", Phil decides that he will take Claire to a trendy [[Manhattan]] restaurant, but they cannot get a table. Phil steals a reservation from a no-show couple, the Tripplehorns, despite Claire's misgivings. While eating, they are approached by two men, Collins and Armstrong, who question them about a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] they believe Phil and Claire stole from [[mobster]] boss Joe Miletto. Phil and Claire explain that they are not the Tripplehorns, but the men do not believe them and threaten them at gunpoint. Not seeing any other way out, Phil lies and tells them it is in a boathouse in [[Central Park]].\n\nAt the boathouse, Claire pretends to search and while Collins and Armstrong's backs are turned, Phil hits them with a paddle and escapes with Claire in a boat. At a police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo, but discover Collins and Armstrong are also detectives, presumably on Miletto's payroll. Realizing they cannot trust the police, they decide to find the real Tripplehorns. They return to the restaurant and find the cellphone number of the Tripplehorns.\n\nClaire remembers a former client, Holbrooke Grant, a security expert and [[James Bond]]-like action hero. At his apartment, Grant traces the cellphone signal to an apartment owned by Thomas Felton. Collins and Armstrong arrive, but Phil and Claire escape in Grant's [[Audi R8]].\n\nThey arrive at Felton's apartment and break in. They question Felton, nicknamed \"Taste\", and his wife \"Whippit\" about the flash drive and Joe Miletto. It turns out that they went to the restaurant, but left when they spotted Collins. Realizing they are in danger, the couple give the flash drive to Phil and flee. When Phil and Claire get back in the Audi, Armstrong and Collins shoot at them. Phil and Claire crash the Audi into a [[Ford Crown Victoria]] [[taxicab]], resulting in the cars being attached at the bumpers. Phil and the cab driver decide to drive off to get away. Phil climbs into the Ford to navigate while Claire navigates the Audi. Phil inserts the flash drive into the driver's [[Amazon Kindle]] and finds pictures of district attorney Frank Crenshaw with prostitutes. After evading Collins and Armstrong, they are eventually hit and are separated by an [[SUV]]. The cab falls into the river; Phil and the driver escape, but without the flash drive.\n\nOn the subway, Phil determines that Felton obtained the flash drive to blackmail Crenshaw. They return to Grant's apartment, and Grant is reluctant to help after becoming exhausted by their incompetence, but Phil begs and he agrees. Phil and Claire go to an illegal [[strip club]] that Crenshaw frequents, with Claire under the guise of a new prostitute and Phil as her [[pimp]]. After performing a pole dance for Crenshaw, they confront him and tell him they are the Tripplehorns. Collins and Armstrong come in and hold them at gunpoint and take them up to the roof with Crenshaw. Miletto arrives with henchmen and it is revealed that Crenshaw has been paid by Miletto to keep him out of jail. When Phil mentions the photos, an argument escalates between the mobsters and Crenshaw, Collins and Armstrong talk. Phil asks Claire to count to three (her typical method of calming their children). When she does, a helicopter appears and Arroyo and the [[SWAT team]] arrest Miletto, Crenshaw, and everyone else, as well as Collins and Armstrong. Arroyo reveals to Claire that she was notified by Grant, who supplied Phil with a wire.\n\nAfter being declared heroes, Phil and Claire enjoy breakfast at a diner, where Phil admits he would marry Claire and have their kids all over again if given the chance. When they return home, they engage in enthusiastic kissing on their front lawn before lying on their backs and watching the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Phil Foster<ref name=Date>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002374.html|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|last2=Fleming|first2=Michael|title=Wahlberg, Franco join 'Date Night'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2009-04-13|access-date=2009-05-26}}</ref>\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Claire Foster<ref name=Date />\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Holbrooke Grant<ref name=Date />\n* [[Taraji P.
