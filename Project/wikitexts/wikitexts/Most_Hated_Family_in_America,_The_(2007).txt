The organization was led by [[Fred Phelps]] and located in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. Westboro Baptist Church members believe that the United States government is immoral due to its tolerance of [[homosexuality]]; in addition, they protest at funerals of U.S. military [[killed in action]] with signs that display text such as \"God Hates Fags\" and \"Thank God for Dead Soldiers\" (which is shown in the film). With a BBC film crew, Theroux travelled to [[Kansas]] to spend time with members of the church and interview its leadership. Theroux interviews church leadership including Fred Phelps and [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]].\n\nThe documentary first aired on [[BBC Two]] in the United Kingdom in April 2007.
