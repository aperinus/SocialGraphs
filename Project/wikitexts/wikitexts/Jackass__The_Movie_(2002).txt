It is a continuation of the [[MTV]] television series ''[[Jackass (franchise)|Jackass]]'', which had completed its run. It was produced by Lynch Siderow Productions and [[Dickhouse Productions]]. The film features most of the original ''Jackass'' cast, including leader [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Steve-O]], [[Bam Margera]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Ehren McGhehey]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]], [[Preston Lacy]], and [[Dave England]]. [[MTV Films]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] released the film to theaters on October 25, 2002. It grossed over $79 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' (2006).\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''Jackass: The Movie'' is a compilation of stunts, skits, and pranks, intercut with on-set talking heads with its cast. The movie begins with the entire main cast riding a giant [[shopping cart]] downhill. At the bottom, the guys crash into a [[fruit stand]] which sends them flying into the fruit.\n\nThe most notable stunts and pranks include [[Johnny Knoxville]] getting flipped over in a [[golf cart]], [[Steve-O]] snorting [[wasabi]], [[Bam Margera]] pranking his mother [[April Margera|April]] by planting a live [[alligator]] in her kitchen, [[Chris Pontius]] dancing in public while wearing nothing but a thong, [[Ryan Dunn]] fighting against a female kickboxing champion, [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]] menacing around [[Japan]] in a giant traffic cone, [[Ehren McGhehey]] eating a snow cone made of his own urine, [[Preston Lacy]] sitting on a bench which is rigged to collapse in front of unsuspecting bystanders, and [[Dave England]] defecating in a display toilet at a hardware store after having an accident in a car where he proceeds to [[fecal incontinence|uncontrollably defecate in his pants]].\n\nThe final stunt involves a toy car being inserted into a cast member's anus in order to get it shown in an x-ray. Steve-O was set to do the stunt, but after being told by his father that he would be disowned if he had done it, Ryan Dunn volunteers and ends up doing the stunt. The end result is successful, as it appears once the x-ray has been taken. The toy car is later seen being defecated out in the end credits. This is followed by Johnny Knoxville being launched into a lake via catapult, where comedian [[Rip Taylor]] closes the film.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe main cast from the TV show that returned for the movie.\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]]\n* [[Bam Margera]]\n* [[Ryan Dunn]]\n* [[Steve-O]]\n* [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu\u00f1a]]\n* [[Chris Pontius]]\n* [[Preston Lacy]]\n* [[Dave England]]\n* [[Ehren McGhehey]]\n}}\n\nGuest appearances:\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Loomis Fall]]\n* [[Brandon DiCamillo]]\n* [[Chris Raab|Raab Himself]]\n* [[Rake Yohn]]\n* [[April Margera]], [[Phil Margera]] and [[Jess Margera]]\n* Stephanie Hodge\n* Mike Kassak\n* [[Manny Puig]]\n* [[Rip Taylor]]\n* [[Tony Hawk]]\n* [[Clyde Singleton]]\n* [[Eric Koston]]\n* [[Mat Hoffman]]\n* [[Naoko Kumagai]]\n* [[Eric Esch|Butterbean]]\n* [[Henry Rollins]]\n}}\n\n=== Crew ===\nCrew members who appear in this movie:\n* Director and producer [[Jeff Tremaine]]\n* Producer [[Spike Jonze]]\n* Executive producer Trip Taylor\n* Co-executive producer Michelle Klepper\n* Co-producer and [[cinematographer]] Dimitry Elyashkevich\n* Co-producer and photographer Sean Cliver\n* Cameramen [[Lance Bangs]], [[Rick Kosick]], Greg \"Guch\" Iguchi, and Mark Rackley\n* Photographer Ben \"Benzo\" Kaller\n\n== Production ==\nAfter the success of the ''Jackass'' TV series, [[Johnny Knoxville]] was approached by the producers to make it into a feature film. Initially, he rejected the idea as he did not understand the concept; thinking they will get Hollywood actors to portray the cast. He later agreed when both [[Jeff Tremaine]] and [[Spike Jonze]] explained it will be a \"naughtier version\" of the TV series.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vanity Fair |title=Johnny Knoxville Breaks Down Every Injury of His Career |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsKXq8AQTZE  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/ZsKXq8AQTZE |archive-date=December 22, 2021 |url-status=live|website=YouTube |access-date=October 6, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nBits that were filmed, but got cut out of the theatrical and home media releases include [[Gene LeBell]] choking the cast out one by one, [[Ryan Dunn]] getting sprayed by [[bear mace]] in the face by [[Bam Margera]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]] skating while being dressed as a penis, [[Preston Lacy]] getting \"fat fuck\" trimmed in his hair by [[cinematographer]] Dimitry Elyashkevich with hair clippers, [[Dave England]] posing as a caricature sketch artist to draw inappropriate drawings, [[Steve-O]] pouring beer in his anus with a garden hose (which was later redone in ''[[Jackass Number Two]]''), [[Chris Pontius]] and Dave England putting a bicycle lock around a crew member's neck, and [[Ehren McGhehey]], Ryan Dunn, Chris Pontius, and [[Mat Hoffman]] [[wakeboarding]] with BMXs attached to the wakeboards. Some of these deleted bits are briefly shown in the credits and/or the making of ''Jackass: The Movie''. Dave England uploaded the caricature sketch artist bit on his [[YouTube]] channel, but it got removed for violating the guidelines. He then re-posted it on his website.\n\nThe original plan for the \"Butt X-Ray\" was for someone to insert a cellphone up their anus and then getting a call, but it later got changed to a toy car. A scene that was planned but never got filmed due to financial reasons was for Chris Pontius to be dressed up as the devil and going to a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church where they [[Snake handling in Christianity|handle live snakes]].\n\n=== \"Failed ending\" ===\nThe original ending for the film was supposed to be a [[Rube Goldberg]]-type contraption, with each of the cast members performing a stunt that either has something to do with what they did on the show (for example, the first stunt would have Preston Lacy as \"The Human Wrecking Ball\", knocking him into a [[Port-a-john|Port-A-Potty]]), or simply for a sight gag (such as Ehren McGhehey being knocked over in the Port-A-Potty and landing on a bed of toilet paper rolls), ending with Johnny being launched off the catapult next to [[Rip Taylor]].\n\nHowever, as the entire contraption didn't work together the way they wanted it to, the producers of the film decided to try filming an alternate ending, which is how they came to film the \"Son of Jackass\" skit. The \"Son of Jackass\" skit (according to the beginning, set in the year 2063) starts almost immediately after Knoxville and Taylor return to the edge of the lake, as Taylor whispers the suggestion into Knoxville's ear, and involves all of the performers in \"old man\" costumes running around in exploding buildings and sheds, with only Steve-O surviving to proclaim \"Yeah, dude.\" In the cast commentary, it is said that this is ironic as Steve-O is the least likely to even reach old age. Some bits of the failed ending were incorporated into the end credits montage, like Dave England dressed in a penis costume and Wee Man going down the giant [[Plinko]] contraption.\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film was released on DVD on March 25, 2003.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Wolf|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=4393|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030215160838/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=4393|title=Video Cautions Viewers Not to Be a Jackass|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=February 15, 2003|date=January 31, 2003|access-date=September 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The DVD includes 27 minutes of additional footage, outtakes and MTV's \"Making of Jackass: The Movie.<ref name=\"MTV\" /> An unrated version of the film was released in 2006, with a runtime of 87 minutes.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film had a budget of $5 million<ref name=mojoweek /> and was the number one film at the United States box office when it opened, grossing $22.8 million, revenue from 2,509 theaters, for an average of $9,073 per venue.
