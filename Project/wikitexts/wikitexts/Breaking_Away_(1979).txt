It follows a group of four male teenagers in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], who have recently graduated from high school. The film stars [[Dennis Christopher]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Barbara Barrie]], [[Paul Dooley]], and [[Robyn Douglass]].\n\n''Breaking Away'' won the 1979 [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for Tesich, and received nominations in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. It also won the 1979 [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Film (Comedy or Musical), and received nominations in three other Golden Globe categories.\n\nAs the film's young lead, Christopher won the 1979 [[BAFTA Award]] for [[33rd British Academy Film Awards#Most Promising Newcomer|Most Promising Newcomer]] and the 1979 [[Young Artist Award]] for [[Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actor in a Feature Film|Best Juvenile Actor]], as well as getting a [[Golden Globe]] nomination as [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor|New Star of the Year]].\n\nThe film was ranked eighth on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Cheers|List of America's 100 Most Inspiring Movies]] compiled by the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) in 2006. In June 2008, AFI also announced its [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]]\u2014the best ten films in ten classic American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. In that poll ''Breaking Away'' ranked as the eighth best film in the sports genre.<ref>{{cite news | author = American Film Institute | author-link = American Film Institute | title = AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres | work = ComingSoon.net | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 | access-date= 2008-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Top 10 Sports | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=4 | publisher= [[American Film Institute]] |access-date= 2008-06-18}}</ref>\n\nTesich was an alumnus of [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. The film was shot in and around Bloomington and on the university's campus.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot==\nDave, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher are working-class friends living in the college town of [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. Now turning 19, they all graduated from high school the year before and are not sure what to do with their lives. They spend much of their time together swimming in an old abandoned water-filled quarry. They sometimes [[Town and gown|clash]] with the more affluent [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] students in their hometown, who habitually refer to them as \"cutters\", a derogatory term for locals related to the local [[Indiana limestone]] industry and the stonecutters who worked the quarries. (The term \"cutters\" was invented for the movie, because the real name \"stonies\u201d was deemed unusable because of its perceived link to marijuana.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Breaking Away\n|first=Ya\u00ebl\n|last=Ksander\n|date=February 5, 2007\n|access-date=May 10, 2019\n|url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/momentofindianahistory/breaking-away/\n|publisher=Indiana Public Media. Minute of Indiana History\n}}</ref>)\n\nDave is obsessed with competitive bicycle racing, and Italian racers in particular, because he recently won a [[Masi Bicycles|Masi]] bicycle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Retro review: recreating the 'Breaking Away' Masi bike |url=https://www.ridemedia.com.au/product/retro-review-recreating-the-breaking-away-masi-bike/ |website=Ride Media |access-date=23 March 2021 |date=31 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Behind the Scenes: Dennis Christopher Talks \"Breaking Away,\" Part I {{!}} RKP |url=https://redkiteprayer.com/2016/08/behind-the-scenes-dennis-christopher-talks-breaking-away-part-i/ |website=redkiteprayer.com |access-date=23 March 2021}}</ref> His down-to-earth father Ray, a former stonecutter who now operates his own used car business (sometimes unethically), is puzzled and exasperated by his son's [[Italophilia|love of Italian]] music and culture, which Dave associates with cycling. However, his mother Evelyn is more understanding and prepares Italian dishes for him.\n\nDave develops a crush on a university student named Katherine and masquerades as an Italian exchange student in order to romance her. One evening, he serenades \"Caterina\" outside her sorority house by singing [[Friedrich von Flotow]]'s aria [[Martha (opera)|\"M' Appar\u00ec Tutt' Amor\"]], with Cyril providing guitar accompaniment. When her boyfriend Rod finds out, he and some of his fraternity brothers beat Cyril up, mistaking him for Dave. Though Cyril wants no trouble, Mike insists on tracking down Rod and starting a brawl. The university president (real-life then President Dr. [[John W. Ryan]]) reprimands the students for their arrogance toward the \"cutters\" and, over their objections, invites the latter to participate in the annual Indiana University [[Little 500]] race.\n\nWhen a professional Italian cycling team comes to town for a race, Dave is thrilled to be competing with them. However, the Italians become irked when Dave is able to keep up with them. One of them jams a tire pump in Dave's wheel, causing him to crash, which leaves him disillusioned. He subsequently confesses his deception to Katherine, who is heartbroken.\n\nDave's friends persuade him to join them in forming a cycling team for the [[Little 500]]. Ray privately tells his son how, when he was a young stonecutter, he was proud to help provide the material to construct the university, yet he never felt comfortable on campus. Later, Dave runs into Katherine, who is leaving for a job in Chicago; they patch things up.\n\nDave is so much better than the other competitors in the Little 500 that, while the other teams switch cyclists every few laps, he rides without a break and builds up a 3/4 lap lead. However, he injures his leg in a crash. Bleeding and in pain, he comes in for a rider change. After some hesitation, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher take turns pedaling, but their dithering has cost them the lead. They fall further and further back. Finally Dave has them tape his feet to the pedals and starts to make up lost ground; he overtakes Rod, the current rider for the favored fraternity team, on the last lap and wins.\n\nRay is proud of his son and takes to riding a bicycle himself. Dave later enrolls at the university, where he meets a pretty French student. Soon, he is extolling to her the virtues of the [[Tour de France]] and French cyclists.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dennis Christopher]] as Dave Stohler\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Mike\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Cyril\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Moocher\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Ray Stohler\n* [[Barbara Barrie]] as Evelyn Stohler\n* [[Robyn Douglass]] as Katherine\n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Rod\n* [[P.

Prior to filming, cyclists Ira Schaffer and Gerry Bretting helped introduce Dennis Christopher and Hart Bochner to the world of bicycle racing after director Peter Yates met Gerry Bretting at Wilshire West Bicycle store. Schaffer and Bretting spent several weeks with Christopher and Bochner. Many of the scenes in the movie were filmed on the campus of Indiana University; glimpses of the [[Indiana Memorial Union]] are in the background of Dave's ride through campus. Dave Stohler's house in the film is located at [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&q=hopeful+st&aq=&sll=39.15722,-86.53656&sspn=0.048851,0.109863&ie=UTF8&hq=hopeful+st&hnear=&ll=39.157386,-86.531292&spn=0,0.010954&z=17&layer=c&cbll=39.157554,-86.531285&panoid=BIkaELGhP6t3eXgOHG6AtA&cbp=12,262.23,,0,-1.97 the corner of S. Lincoln St. and E. Dodds St]. The pizza restaurant in the film (PAGLIAI'S) is now Opie Taylors on the east side of North Walnut Street, across from the Monroe County Courthouse. Other scenes were filmed outside the [[Delta Delta Delta]] sorority house (818 E. 3rd St) and along Jordan Street.\n\nDave's \"ecstasy ride\" on the wooded road after first meeting Kathy (where his bike tire blew) was filmed on the \"West Gate Road\" in Indiana's [[Brown County State Park]], {{convert|14|mi}} east of Bloomington on [[Indiana State Road 46|State Road 46]].\n\nTwo other scenes were filmed on W. 7th St.: one at Fairview Elementary, the other three blocks east near the intersection of W. 7th St. and N. Madison (the old railroad tracks have since been removed). A scene in which Dave runs a red light in front of his father was filmed at the southwest corner of the Monroe County Courthouse, at the intersection of College St. and W. Kirkwood Ave. (a few seconds before he runs it, the light is visible as he rides by the courthouse and sees Moocher and Nancy). The starting-line scene of the Cinzano 100 bicycle race was at the intersection of Indiana State Roads 46 and [[Indiana State Road 446|446]] on the city's eastern edge.\n\nThe abandoned limestone quarry where Dave and his friends swam is on private property in [[Perry Township, Monroe County, Indiana|Perry Township]] south of Bloomington. It is located at the end of East Empire Mill Road off old [[Indiana State Road 37|State Road 37]] and is illegal for visitors to trespass. Rooftop Quarry, as it is referred to locally, was originally known as Sanders Quarry or The Long Hole. Access to the quarry has been made difficult by its owners, Indiana Limestone Company, to discourage people from swimming and jumping into the quarry citing safety concerns.<ref>{{cite news |title=These New Photos Show Rooftop Is Inaccessible But Not Destroyed |url=https://www.limestonepostmagazine.com/these-new-photos-show-rooftop-is-inaccessible-but-not-destroyed/ |access-date=2 January 2019 |work=Limestone Post Magazine |date=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe used car lot (\"Campus Cars\") that Dave's father owns was on S. Walnut St., and was a real used car lot for many years, but now has two small commercial buildings on the property; it is located at 1010 S. Walnut St.  Next door is the local Honda motorcycle franchise seen in the background of the \"Refund? REFUND??\" scene; the Honda franchise was demolished in early 2019.\n\nThe film features music by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Friedrich von Flotow]]. The music was adapted by [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]].\n\nTesich and Yates worked together again on ''[[Eyewitness (1981 film)|Eyewitness]]'' (1981) and ''[[Eleni (film)|Eleni]]'' (1985). Tesich later wrote the cycling-themed film ''[[American Flyers]]'' (1985).\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews upon its release. [[Roger Ebert]] called it \"a wonderfully sunny, funny, goofy, intelligent movie that makes you feel about as good as any movie in a long time. It is, in fact, a treasure ... Movies like this are hardly ever made at all; when they're made this well, they're precious cinematic miracles.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/breaking-away-1979 |title=Breaking Away |author=Roger Ebert |date=January 1, 1979}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s [[Janet Maslin]] wrote that, even though \"the cast is unknown, the director has a spotty history, and the basic premise falls into this year's most hackneyed category ... the finished product is wonderful.
