[[Nick Brimble]], [[Rosanna Arquette]], [[Lynn Whitfield]], and [[Willie Nelson]] co-star. It is the only collaboration between Glover and Pesci outside of the ''[[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon series]]''. [[Christopher Cain]] directed the film. [[J. J. Abrams]] and Jill Mazursky wrote the film's script.\n\nThe film was released on May 30, 1997. It was panned by critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing just $19 million against its $53 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Waters and Gus Green are bumbling, blue-collar, yet happy best friends and next door neighbors who live modestly in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and have known each other since childhood. They share the hobby of fishing and win a stay in the Florida Everglades to go [[angling]], but promise to return home in time for Thanksgiving.\n\nOn the way, however, while stopping at a restaurant, they meet an Englishman, Martin, who discreetly steals Joe's car keys and leaves. Joe and Gus are forced to push their boat down the road until they are met by two women, Rita and Angie, who are after Martin and offer them a lift. During the ride, a bump causes the boat to disconnect from the car, leaving Joe and Gus stranded yet again, and the boat is accidentally hooked to a train and pulled away along with their beer and supplies. Joe and Gus hitch a ride with two men, but on the way, they see their car at a gas station and investigate. Joe goes to confront Martin inside the bathroom, but backs down when he catches Martin loading a gun. Joe and Gus flee the petrol station in their car, and discover a blood-stained knife in the dashboard.\n\nJoe and Gus stay at a trailer park for the night, and while watching a documentary on television, they learn that Martin is actually Dekker Massey, a wanted criminal who has conned several women out of their riches and is implied to have stabbed his last victim to death and hidden her money and jewelry somewhere. The presenters offer a bounty for Dekker's capture, and Joe and Gus decide to turn in the knife after their fishing trip. Meanwhile, Dekker begins hunting Joe and Gus down.\n\nFollowing a recommendation by the trailer park owner, Joe and Gus visit Phil Beasly's boatyard and rent a speedboat, but end up breaking almost every gadget on the boat, losing the knife and wrecking the boatyard by accident. Distraught, they decide to return home early, but end up with a flat tire. While getting the spare tire from the trunk, Joe discovers a map that leads to Dekker's fortune. They book a room in a nearby hotel, and while having dinner, they are found by Rita and Angie, who question them about Dekker and reveal that they are after him because Rita's mother was one of Dekker's victims. Joe and Gus promise to bring Dekker to justice, but that night, Gus sleepwalks and starts a fire in the hotel, destroying their suite and the map. They only barely manage to escape undetected, though their car breaks down on the road and Joe is struck by lightning while they try to fix it. Instead of killing him, the lightning boosts Joe's memory and he is able to lead the way to the cave where Dekker hid his fortune. Despite an altercation with an alligator, they retrieve the treasure and escape, but are accosted by Dekker. At gunpoint, Dekker forces them to push Joe's car into the swamp and ties them up inside a sheriff's office, intending to flee the country with the treasure.\n\nAfter Dekker leaves, however, Joe and Gus are found and freed by their idol, Billy \"Catch\" Pool, and they set out to stop Dekker. After a long chase across the swamp, Joe and Gus find and capture Dekker moments before his escape via plane and hand him over to the police. Though they claim the reward money, Joe and Gus are forced to spend it mostly on the damages they caused during their trip.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Joe Waters\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Gus Green\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Rita, the daughter of one of Dekker Massey's victims\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Angie, Rita's best friend\n* [[Willie Nelson]] as Billy Pooler, a professional fisherman who is Joe and Gus's idol\n* [[Nick Brimble]] as Dekker Massey, a British conman\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Donna Waters, Joe's wife\n* [[Gary Grubbs]] as Phil Beasly, the owner of a boatyard\n* Edythe Davis as Cookie Green, Gus's wife\n* Jenna Bari as Gena Waters, Joe's daughter\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Glenn, the owner of a trailer park\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Kirk, a waiter who takes a shine to Joe and Gus (uncredited)\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Suzy, a restaurant owner (uncredited)\n* [[Ron Duprat]] as Firefighter\n\n==Production==\nWhen ''Gone Fishin{{'}}'' was in the early stages of development during the early 1990s, the roles of Joe and Gus were first offered to [[John Candy]] and [[Rick Moranis]].

In ''Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon'', [[Joe Queenan (author)|Joe Queenan]] said that he was \"so embarrassed about Joe Pesci that he has been known to wait outside cinemas showing a film called ''Gone Fishin''{{'}} and give those few customers who sat through it their money back, on behalf of the \"American Celluloid Retribution Society\".<ref>David Dale, \"The stars and gripes\", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 Oct 1998, Spectrum, p. 10s</ref>\n\nThe film also received two nominations at the 1997 [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]]: Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Worst Actor for Pesci.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestinkers.com/1997.html |title=The Stinkers 1997 Ballot |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818030700/http://www.thestinkers.com/1997.html |work=[[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]] |archive-date=18 August 2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Stunt#Stunts that have gone wrong|Accidents while performing a stunt]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119214|title=Gone Fishin'}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|gone_fishin|title=Gone Fishin'}}\n* {{Mojo title|gonefishin|Gone Fishin'}}\n\n{{J.
