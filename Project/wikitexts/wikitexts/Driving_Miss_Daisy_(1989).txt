The film stars [[Jessica Tandy]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Freeman reprised his role from the original [[Off-Broadway]] production.\n\nThe story defines Daisy and her point of view through a network of relationships and emotions by focusing on her home life, synagogue, friends, family, fears, and concerns over a twenty-five-year period.\n\n''Driving Miss Daisy'' was a critical and commercial success upon its release and at the [[62nd Academy Awards]] received nine nominations, and won four: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Tandy), [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].<ref name=\"Oscars1990\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990 |title=The 62nd Academy Awards (1990) Nominees and Winners |access-date=August 1, 2011 |work=oscars.org |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402002952/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2022, it is the most recent [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|PG-rated]] film to have won Best Picture.<!-- We're not saying this is the last PG-rated film to win best picture, but it might be in the future. -->\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1948, Daisy Werthan, or Miss Daisy ([[Jessica Tandy]]), a 72-year-old wealthy, [[Jewish American|Jewish]], widowed, retired schoolteacher, lives alone in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], except for a black housekeeper, Idella ([[Esther Rolle]]). When Miss Daisy drives her 1946 [[Chrysler Windsor#1946\u20131948|Chrysler Windsor]] into her neighbor's yard, her 40-year-old son Boolie ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) buys her a 1949 [[Hudson Commodore#Third generation|Hudson Commodore]] and hires 60-year-old Hoke Colburn ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a black chauffeur. Boolie claims to Hoke that Miss Daisy may not appreciate his efforts, but she can't fire him, as Boolie himself is his employer. Miss Daisy at first refuses to let anyone drive her, but Hoke convinces her to be driven.  She reluctantly accepts the first two trips, but tries to get Boolie to fire Hoke after discovering a can of salmon missing from her pantry.  However, she relents when Hoke, unprompted and before she is able to confront him, admits to eating the salmon and offers her a replacement can he had bought.\n\nAs Miss Daisy and Hoke spend time together, she gains appreciation for his many skills and teaches him to read for the first time using her teacher skills and resources. After Idella dies in the spring of 1963, rather than hire a new housekeeper, Miss Daisy decides to care for her own house and have Hoke do the cooking and the driving.  Hoke, meanwhile, buys the cars that he drives Daisy in after they are traded in for newer models and is able to gradually negotiate higher salaries with Boolie.\n\nThe film explores [[Racism in the United States|racism against black people]], which affects Hoke personally. The film also touches on [[Antisemitism in the United States|anti-semitism]] in the South. After her [[The Temple (Atlanta)|synagogue]] [[Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing|is bombed]], Miss Daisy realizes that she is also a victim of prejudice. But American society is undergoing radical changes, and Miss Daisy attends a dinner at which Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gives a speech.\n\nShe initially invites Boolie to the dinner, but he declines, and suggests that Miss Daisy invite Hoke. However, Miss Daisy only asks him to be her guest during the car ride to the event and ends up attending the dinner alone. Hoke, who was insulted by the manner of the invitation, listened to the speech on the car radio outside.\n\nHoke arrives at the house one morning in 1971 to find Miss Daisy agitated and showing signs of [[dementia]], believing she is a young teacher again. Hoke calms her down with a conversation in which Daisy calls Hoke her \"best friend.\" Boolie arranges for Miss Daisy to enter a retirement home. In 1973, Hoke, now 85 and rapidly losing his eyesight, retires. Boolie, now 65, drives Hoke to the retirement home to visit Miss Daisy, now 97.<ref>{{cite book| title=Driving Miss Daisy| first=Alfred| last=Uhry| date=January 1, 1998| publisher=Dramatists Play Service, Inc.|isbn = 0822203359}}</ref> He then feeds her thanksgiving pie after the two catch up.
