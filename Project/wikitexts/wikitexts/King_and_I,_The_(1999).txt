The voice cast stars [[Miranda Richardson]] and [[Martin Vidnovic]] as Leonowens and Mongkut, respectively, with [[Ian Richardson]], [[Darrell Hammond]], and [[Adam Wylie]]. The score, songs, and some of the character names come from [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]'s 1951 stage musical [[The King and I|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=2009 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-6600-1 |edition=3rd |page=194}}</ref> Screenwriters Peter Bakalian, [[Jacqueline Feather]], and [[David Seidler]] took creative liberties with the history and with the source material from the musical in an attempt to make the film palatable to all audiences.\n\n''The King and I'' was released on March 19, 1999, eight months prior to ''[[Anna and the King]]'', a live-action adaptation of the same story. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"charmless and shoddily animated.\" ''The King and I'' earned $12 million at the box office<ref name=\"mojo\"/> and its gross was seen as disappointing compared to that of other animated films released at the time. The film received five nominations including the [[London Film Critics' Circle|London Critics Circle Film Award]] for British Actress of the Year for Richarson and the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Award]] for Best Sound Editing in Animated Feature.\n\nAside from foreign films, TV shows, and direct-to-video films, ''The King and I'' was the final mainstream theatrical film to officially be released under the [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] banner. Warner Bros. has since released theatrical family films under their standard [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] banner.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1862, a ship sails from [[London]] to [[Bangkok]], on board are [[Anna Leonowens]] and her son [[Louis T. Leonowens|Louis]]. Kralahome, [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], uses his powers of illusion to cause it to appear as if a massive [[sea serpent]] is attacking the ship as it's battered in a storm. Anna, with the help of Captain Orton, manage to save Louis from drowning. As they approach Bangkok, the captain explains to Anna how the kingdom is politically structured.\n\nIn the [[Grand Palace]], in [[Siam]], Anna witnesses King [[Mongkut]] receive a gift in the form of a slave, Tuptim, a young woman from [[Burma]]. Despite being promised her own house outside the palace, Anna is denied it. The King drags Anna to his workshop in which he tests new inventions such as [[hot air balloons]] and [[trains]]. Louis is taken on a tour of the [[arsenal|armory]] by the Kralahome's henchman, Master Little, who barely misses an injury. In the palace gardens, Prince [[Chulalongkorn]] meets Tuptim and they fall in love, but Chulalongkorn keeps his true identity hidden. The King's wives help Anna unpack and Anna sees Chulalongkorn and Tuptim in the courtyard and supports their relationship. Anna wants to leave since she will not receive the house, but changes her mind after she meets the royal children, especially Chulalongkorn.\n\nWith the Kralahome still plotting to overthrow the king, he writes a letter to the [[British Empire]] that claims that Anna is in danger. Anna begins to teach the children and learns that they never been outside the palace walls. To give the hands-on experience, she takes all of the royal children around the city to see how other people live, which, in turn, angers the King. The Kralahome reports it from Master Little, who tells him of seeing the outing. It boils over into a fight, with Anna still complaining about the house that she was promised but has yet to receive.\n\nChulalongkorn meets with his father to discuss traditions. He wants to be with Tuptim but knows that his father would never allow it. Confused, Mongkut goes to pray to [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The Kralahome then uses his powers on the statues in the room to try and attack the king, which the king's [[black panther]], Rama, fights off. When Chulalongkorn is [[kickboxing]], Tuptim finally learns that he is the crown prince and that their love is forbidden. However, he tells her that he does not care about tradition and wants to be with her. Master Little learns of their relationship and tells the Kralahome, who plans to use it to anger the King at the right time.\n\nAnna goes to the King to learn that he is troubled after he learned that the British are coming because he is allegedly a [[barbarian]], which she knows is false. Anna advises the King to throw a banquet for the British when they arrive so that he can show that he is civilized. At the dinner, the Kralahome mentions the royal ivory pendant that the King is supposed to wear, which he gave to his son, who then gave it to Tuptim. When it is revealed that Chulalongkorn gave it away, Tuptim is brought in by guards. Dishonored by the relationship, the King threatens to whip Tuptim to death, but finds that he can't do it; she and Chulalongkorn later escape into the jungle with Louis.\n\nWhile they escape, the Kralahome uses his powers to guide them through the jungle across a rope bridge. The bridge collapses, and Tuptim and Chulalongkorn are almost swept away by a river. The King, having had a change of heart and using one of his hot air balloons, rescues them with Louis's help in distracting Master Little's interference. However, on their journey back to the palace, the Kralahome fires a firework, destroys the balloon, and causes it to crash. Everyone but the King is able to jump into a lake to safety. The Kralahome celebrates his apparent victory of killing the King, but ends up exposing his true nature in front of Sir Edward and the royal guards.\n\nAn injured, bedridden King tells his son to be ready to lead Siam if he dies and allows him and Tuptim to be married and becoming king and queen. With his evil schemes of overthrowing the King exposed, the Kralahome loses his position, and as a punishment, he is forced to clean the elephant stables, with Master Little as his boss (who now loses all his teeth and attacks him). The King heals from his injury and presents Anna with her house outside the palace walls, and the two of them dance.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Miranda Richardson]]  as [[Anna Leonowens]]\n** [[Christiane Noll]] (singing voice)\n* [[Martin Vidnovic]] as [[Mongkut|King Mongkut of Siam]]\n* Allen D.
