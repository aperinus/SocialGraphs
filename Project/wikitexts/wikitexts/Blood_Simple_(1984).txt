Emmet Walsh]]. Its plot follows a [[Texas]] bartender who finds himself in the midst of a murder plot when his boss discovers that he is having a love affair with his wife. It was the directorial debut of the Coens and the first major film of [[cinematographer]] [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], who later became a director, as well as the feature-film debut of McDormand.\n\nThe film's title derives from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] novel ''[[Red Harvest]]'' (1929), in which the term \"blood simple\" describes the addled, fearful mind-set of people after prolonged immersion in violent situations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Falsani, Cathleen.| title=The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers|location= Grand Rapids, MI|date= 2009|publisher= Zondervan|page= 31}}</ref> Stylistically, the film has been noted for its blending elements of neo-noir, [[pulp magazines|pulp]] crime stories, and low-budget [[horror film]]s.<ref name=criterion/> In 2001, a [[director's cut]] was released, the same year that it was ranked number 98 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]].\n\n==Plot==\nBartender Ray and housewife Abby are driving through a heavy downpour at night, discussing Abby's bad marriage to Ray's boss Julian Marty. After gradually admitting they are attracted to each other, they stop at a motel and have sex. Lorren Visser, a private detective, takes photos of the tryst and delivers them to Marty.\n\nAbby grabs some belongings from home, including a small pistol Marty gifted to her, and warns Ray to stay away from the bar. Instead, Ray goes and asks Marty for his unpaid wages. Marty mocks Ray, predicting that Abby will betray him the way she did Marty and when confronted will say, \"I haven't done anything funny.\"\n\nThe next morning Marty attempts to kidnap Abby from Ray's home, but she beats him up. Humiliated, he offers Visser $10,000 to kill the couple. Visser agrees and tells him to \"go fishing\" and establish an alibi. Visser breaks into Ray's home and steals Abby's gun. He presents photos of the couple's corpses to Marty as evidence. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit and then opens the safe to give Visser his fee, surreptitiously placing one of the photos inside. Visser suddenly shoots Marty with Abby's gun, leaving it and taking the money. However, Visser doesn't realize his cigarette lighter is underneath the fish Marty caught on his trip.\n\nIt is then revealed that Visser doctored photos of the couple asleep to look as if he shot them. Ray, deciding to confront Marty about his wages again, returns to the bar and discovers his body, accidentally discharging Abby's gun when he steps on it. Assuming the worst, he puts the gun in Marty's coat pocket and the body in the backseat of his car. While driving, he is shocked to discover that Marty is still alive, albeit barely. Ray drives into a field and begins to bury Marty in a shallow grave. Finding the gun, Marty takes aim and pulls the trigger three times, falling on an empty chamber each time. Ray gingerly takes the gun and finishes burying Marty as he screams in terror.\n\nA distraught Ray goes to Abby's new apartment and tries to explain that he \"cleaned up your mess.\" She, unnerved by the blood on his clothes, says \"I haven't done anything funny,\" which disturbs him further and leads to an argument. Visser calls the apartment but does not speak when Abby picks up; she assumes and tells Ray that it was Marty. Horrified, he drops the gun as he leaves. Later, he is confronted by Meurice, the other bartender, who tells him about a phone message Marty left regarding money stolen from the safe (Marty's cover story for the $10,000 he paid Visser). \n\nWhile burning the doctored photos, Visser realizes that Marty kept one and that he cannot find his lighter. Knowing these can implicate him, he returns to the bar and attempts to break into the safe, but is thwarted by the arrival of Abby, who thinks the damage to the safe was caused by Ray and starts to realize Marty might be dead. Later, she has a nightmare of Marty, warning her that Ray will kill her as well. She goes to confront Ray who, now thoroughly confused, tells her Marty was still alive Ray buried him.\n\nWhile Abby tells Meurice about her suspicions, Ray goes to the bar himself and, opening the safe, discovers the doctored photo. Believing Abby is in danger, he realizes someone is following him on the way to her apartment. When Abby arrives and discovers Ray sitting in the dark, she turns the lights on, thinking it will protect her from him. Visser, who is on a rooftop across the street with a rifle, shoots and kills Ray. Abby manages to smash the lightbulb with her shoes and hides in the bathroom. \n\nEntering the apartment, Visser searches Ray for the lighter (which was overlooked by everyone) and goes into the bathroom, only to find Abby has climbed out the window into the next apartment. When he reaches around to open the window she stabs him with Ray's knife, pinning his hand to the sill. As she backs away in shock, Visser empties his gun into the wall, then punches through it to remove the knife. Returning to the apartment, Abby picks up her gun and shoots Visser through the bathroom door. Abby says, \"I'm not afraid of you, Marty.\" Visser, lying mortally wounded on the floor, bursts into laughter and responds, \"Well, ma'am, if I see him, I'll sure give him the message.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Getz]] as Ray\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Abby\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Julian Marty\n* [[M.
