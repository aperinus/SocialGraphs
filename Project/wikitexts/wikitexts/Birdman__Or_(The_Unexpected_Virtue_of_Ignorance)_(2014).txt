It was written by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]], [[Alexander Dinelaris Jr.]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]]. The film stars [[Michael Keaton]] as Riggan Thomson, a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story, \"[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love#\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\"|What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]\". The film also features a supporting cast of [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Emma Stone]], and [[Naomi Watts]].\n\nThe film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief exception appears as if filmed in a [[One-shot film|single shot]], an idea I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had from the film's conception. Cinematographer [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] believed that the recording time necessary for the [[long take]] approach taken in ''Birdman'' could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], [[Regency Enterprises]] and [[Worldview Entertainment]]. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]].\n\n''Birdman'' had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. Grossing more than $103 million worldwide, the film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise towards its screenplay, direction, cinematography, and the performances of the cast (particularly Keaton, Norton, and Stone). ''Birdman'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], along with [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] from a total of nine nominations, tying it with ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' for the most nominated and awarded film at the [[87th Academy Awards]]. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]], as well as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]] for Keaton and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] at the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be less than 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n{{Anchor|Synopsis|Plot}}Riggan Thomson is a faded actor famous for playing a [[superhero]] named Birdman in a film trilogy from 1989 to 1992. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. Riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story, \"[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love#\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\"|What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]].\" However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is essential to Riggan's identity.\n\nJake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend, Laura, and Broadway d\u00e9butante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed [[Method acting|method actor]] Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over replacing his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and complains that the prop gun does not look natural. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her using marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him he is irrelevant and the play is for his own vanity.\n\nDuring the final preview, after seeing Mike and Sam kissing backstage, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through [[Times Square]] in his [[briefs]] and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show, and she thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going [[Viral video|viral]] and explains how this actually helps him.\n\nRiggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a cynical and highly influential theater critic. She promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without seeing it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he visualizes Birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.\n\nOn opening night, the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago, he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about the Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia leaves, Riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on stage. The play receives a [[standing ovation]].\n\nRiggan wakes up in a hospital\u2014the suicide attempt merely blew off his nose, which has been surgically reconstructed. Tabitha has published a glowing review of the play, calling the suicide attempt just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the [[Twitter]] account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and says goodbye to Birdman, seen seated on the toilet. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling at what she sees.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Riggan Thomson\n** [[Benjamin Kanes]] as Young Riggan / Birdman\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Jake\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Mike Shiner\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Laura Alburn\n* [[Amy Ryan]] as Sylvia Thomson\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Sam Thomson\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Lesley Truman\n* [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Tabitha Dickinson\n* [[Merritt Wever]] as Annie\n* [[Jeremy Shamos]] as Ralph\n* [[Bill Camp]] as Crazy Man\n* [[Damian Young]] as Gabriel\n* [[Paula Pell]] as Lady in Bar\n* [[Donna Lynne Champlin]] as Broadway Lady\n* [[Craig muMs Grant]] as Broadway Man\n* [[Jackie Hoffman]] as Mary Lady on Balcony\n* [[Susan Blackwell]] as Intermission Woman\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Birdman'' director [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu|Alejandro G.

The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing ''[[Biutiful]]'', he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again.<ref name=\"genocide\">{{cite web|title=Alejandro G.

Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \"were really more like play scenes\".<ref name=\"CS\" /> I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's own experiences influenced many of ''Birdman''{{'}}s themes. \"What this film talks about, I have been through\", I\u00f1\u00e1rritu recalled. \"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\"<ref name=\"genocide\" /> Dinelaris described this aspect as \"a laughing look at oneself\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way; otherwise, \"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\".<ref name=\"genocide\" /> Themes from [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story \"[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's.<ref name=\"CS\" /> Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \"terrifying\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer [[Tess Gallagher]], loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.<ref name=\"genocide\" />\n\nWhile some aspects of the film{{snd}} the first frame with Riggan, for instance{{snd}} went unchanged from ''Birdman's'' conception to release,<ref name=\"genocide\" /> others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in [[Central Park]] and flies out to save himself.<ref name=\"CS\" />\n\nThe film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming.<ref name=\"Taylor 2\">{{cite web|title=Interview: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Talks 'Birdman', The Film's \"Bad\" Original Ending, Critics, 'True Detective' & More |last=Taylor |first=Drew |date=January 8, 2015 |publisher=Indiewire.com |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-talks-birdman-the-films-bad-original-ending-critics-true-detective-more-20150108?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010101/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview%2Dalejandro%2Dgonzalez%2Dinarritu%2Dtalks%2Dbirdman%2Dthe%2Dfilms%2Dbad%2Doriginal%2Dending%2Dcritics%2Dtrue%2Ddetective%2Dmore%2D20150108?page%3D2|access-date=February 12, 2015 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The original intended to depict [[Johnny Depp]] in Riggan's dressing room with a ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' poster in the back.

Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said: \"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be \"very, very sure about what was on the page\".<ref name=\"CS\" /> As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft.<ref name=\"SCU\">{{cite web|title=BIRDMAN Writers Thought No One Would 'Get It' |last=Milly |first=Jenna |date=December 5, 2014 |publisher=ScreenwritingU |url=http://www.screenwritingu.com/blog/birdman |access-date=February 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212153111/http://www.screenwritingu.com/blog/birdman |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As [[Alexander Dinelaris|Dinelaris]] summarized: \"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot.

The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York.<ref name=\"arri\" /> Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.<ref name=\"lubezki_int\" />\n\nThroughout shooting, [[Arri Alexa]] cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the [[Steadicam]]. Neither used [[matte box]]es, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\"<ref name=\"steadcam_int\" /> Lubezki{{snd}} who did all the handheld camerawork<ref name=\"lubezki_int\" />{{snd}} had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors,<ref name=\"arri\" /> sometimes filming two inches (5&nbsp;cm) away from Keaton's face.<ref name=\"desowitz\" /> The camera also allowed recording for such a long period{{snd}} necessary for the long takes of the movie{{snd}} that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before.<ref name=\"arri\" /> The cameras were lensed with [[Leica Camera|Leica]] Summilux-C or [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] Master Primes.<ref name=\"steadcam_int\" /> Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\".<ref name=\"arri\" /> In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give I\u00f1\u00e1rritu the \"intimacy\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.<ref name=\"steadcam_int\" />\n\nDespite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed.<ref name=\"MM\" /> The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]], recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Edward Norton Won't Talk to Emma Stone|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/13766|work=[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]|publisher=[[NBC]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209064959/http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/segments/13766|archive-date=February 9, 2015}}</ref> Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing.<ref name=\"lubezki_int\" /> As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving I\u00f1\u00e1rritu more options during post-production.<ref name=\"sd-editors\" /> Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually 20 for the shorter scenes,<ref name=\"lubezki_int\" /> the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth.<ref name=\"steadcam_int\" /> Chris Haarhoff described it as \"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment\". The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.<ref name=\"lubezki_int\" />\n\nWhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \"check out\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of ''Birdman'', \"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball\". Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's process \"creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\".<ref name=\"bold\" /> Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \"felt emblematic of how it feels onstage{{snd}}at least my long-time memories from long ago\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's 'Birdman' is Brainy, Buoyant, Brash, Meta Moviemaking|last=Bailey|first=Jason|date=October 12, 2014|publisher=Flavorwire|url=http://flavorwire.com/482051/alejandro-inarritus-birdman-is-brainy-buoyant-brash-meta-moviemaking|access-date=February 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209065010/http://flavorwire.com/482051/alejandro-inarritus-birdman-is-brainy-buoyant-brash-meta-moviemaking|archive-date=February 9, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \"wonderful\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived, and then \"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\".<ref name=\"atm\" /> Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved.

The score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces, including [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]].

The drum sections comprise the majority of the score, however, and were composed by S\u00e1nchez. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film...

The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrione said that in ''Birdman'' I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had \"let go of that safety net\".<ref name=\"credits2\" /> Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on,<ref name=\"credits1\" /> and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrione was busy and unable to be in New York.)<ref name=\"sd-editors\" /> Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy I\u00f1\u00e1rritu \"dragged it out\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right.<ref name=\"sd-editors\" /> For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies.<ref name=\"deadline-editing\">{{cite web |title=A Fine Frenzy |last=Bowles |first=Scott |date=October 31, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/editing-duo-behind-birdman-had-their-work-cut-out-for-them-864571/ |access-date=July 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705130643/https://deadline.com/2014/10/editing-duo-behind-birdman-had-their-work-cut-out-for-them-864571/ |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used S\u00e1nchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \"pretty traditional\".

For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D [[Matte painting|digital matte painting]] of the reflected environment. They then [[rotoscoped]] out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /><ref name=\"btl-fx\">{{cite web |title=The Use of VFX to Stitch Birdman Together|last=Fotheringham|first=Scott|date=February 2, 2015|publisher=Below the Line|url=http://www.btlnews.com/awards/the-use-of-vfx-to-stitch-birdman-together|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132921/http://www.btlnews.com/awards/the-use-of-vfx-to-stitch-birdman-together/|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by [[matchmoving]] and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu demanded a \"very precise rhythm and flow\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with [[Timewarps|timewarp]] curves to fit the pacing the director desired.<ref name=\"fxguide\" />\n\nUnlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to [[Previsualization|previsualize]] the sequence.<ref name=\"halon\">{{cite web|title=Birdman|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Halon Entertainment|url=http://www.halon.com/web/our-work/birdman|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705132932/http://www.halon.com/web/our-work/birdman/|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence,<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> using a camera crane on a truck.<ref name=\"yvr\" /> When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four [[GoPro]] cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring [[High-dynamic-range imaging|high-dynamic-range images]] of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying, \"Instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen, [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks, and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished, they \"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\", but once it was completed, \"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\".<ref name=\"sd-editors\" />\n\nSound design for the film was handled by Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \"surprisingly perfect and clean\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it.<ref name=\"btl-sound\">{{cite web|title=Contender - Sound Editor Martin Hernandez, Birdman|last=Skweres|first=Mary Ann|date=December 29, 2014|publisher=Below the Line|url=http://www.btlnews.com/awards/contender-sound-editor-martin-hernandez-birdman|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705133127/http://www.btlnews.com/awards/contender-sound-editor-martin-hernandez-birdman/|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hern\u00e1ndez edited sound though. \"Normally, Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds'. The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything{{snd}} backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on ''Birdman'' because here, everything is flowing.\"<ref name=\"btl-sound\" /> Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task, since the camera was nearly always moving.<ref name=\"btl-sound\" /> Hern\u00e1ndez also helped to cut S\u00e1nchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film.<ref name=\"morelia\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, 2015 Oscar Nominee|last=Alem\u00e1n|first=Cristina|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|url=http://moreliafilmfest.com/en/como-suena-el-entorno-entrevista-a-martin-hernandez|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705133140/http://moreliafilmfest.com/en/como-suena-el-entorno-entrevista-a-martin-hernandez/|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\" the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hern\u00e1ndez described the job as \"crazy\".<ref name=\"btl-sound\" /> A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers.<ref name=\"morelia\" /> Hern\u00e1ndez said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \"provokes more 'explosions'\" than that created by images, and that in ''Birdman'', \"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\".<ref name=\"morelia\" />\n\nThe [[digital intermediate]] was completed by a team at [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on ''Gravity'',<ref name=\"tnclr-BM_page\">{{cite web|title=Birdman|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=October 22, 2014|publisher=[[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]]|url=http://www.technicolor.com/en/who-we-are/press-news-center/news/birdman|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705130754/http://www.technicolor.com/en/who-we-are/press-news-center/news/birdman|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> but needed to approach ''Birdman'' differently because of the continuous-shot approach.

To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another\". Inserting the dissolves required [[rotoscoping]] methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the [[Matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu remarked that \"everyone was out of their comfort zone\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.<ref name=\"tnclr-pdf\">{{cite report|title=Birdman - Case Study|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|year=2015 |publisher=technicolor|url=http://www.technicolor.com/download/file/fid/7518?file=20150213_birdman_case_study_v3.pdf|access-date=July 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705131954/http://www.technicolor.com/download/file/fid/7518?file=20150213_birdman_case_study_v3.pdf|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis and themes ==\nThe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \"At the ending of the film, [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kendrick|first=Ben|title=''Birdman'' Ending Explained|date=April 5, 2015|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|url=http://screenrant.com/birdman-ending-explained-spoilers-riggan-dead|access-date=September 16, 2015|archive-date=September 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915072525/http://screenrant.com/birdman-ending-explained-spoilers-riggan-dead/|url-status=live}}</ref> Many aspects of [[film theory]] were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) [[film genre]]; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an [[Character (arts)|actor]].
