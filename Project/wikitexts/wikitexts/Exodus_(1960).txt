It was made by Alpha and Carlyle Productions and distributed by [[United Artists]]. Produced and directed by [[Otto Preminger]], the screenplay was written by [[Dalton Trumbo]] based on the 1958 novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'' by [[Leon Uris]]. The picture features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[John Derek]] and [[George Maharis]]. The film's [[Exodus (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] music was written by [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]].\n\nPreminger openly hired screenwriter Trumbo, who had been on the [[Hollywood blacklist]] for over a decade for being a Communist and forced to work under assumed names. Together with ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', also written by Trumbo, ''Exodus'' is credited with ending the practice of [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting in the US motion picture industry]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nAfter the [[World War II|Second World War]], Katherine \"Kitty\" Fremont, a widowed American nurse, is sightseeing in [[Cyprus]] following a tour of duty for the U.S. [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] in Greece. Her guide mentions the [[Karaolos prisoner of war camp|Karaolos]] [[Cyprus internment camps|internment]] camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews\u2014many of them [[Holocaust]] survivors\u2014are detained by the British, who refuse them passage to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Kitty visits British General Sutherland, who knew her late husband. When Sutherland suggests she volunteer at the internment camp for a few days, Kitty declines, citing she would feel uncomfortable around Jews. She reconsiders shortly after one of the General's staff officers, Major Freddy Caldwell ([[Peter Lawford]]), makes an anti-Semitic remark.\n\n[[Haganah]] rebel Ari Ben Canaan, a decorated former captain in the [[Jewish Brigade]] of the [[British Army]] in the Second World War, obtains a cargo ship. He smuggles 611 Jews out of the camp and onto the ship for an [[Illegal immigration|illegal voyage]] to Mandate Palestine. Military authorities discover the plan and [[blockade]] [[Famagusta]] harbor, preventing the ship's departure. The refugees stage a [[hunger strike]], during which the camp's doctor dies and Ari threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees. The British relent and allow the ship, rechristened the ''Exodus'', to sail.\n\nWhile helping at the camp, Kitty meets Karen Hansen Clement, a [[History of the Jews in Denmark|Danish-Jewish]] teenager. Kitty grows fond of Karen and offers to take her back to America with her. Karen, whose mother and siblings were murdered in the Holocaust, is searching for her missing father. She has also aligned herself with the Zionist cause, and, wanting to go to Palestine, eventually turns down Kitty's offer.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition to partitioning Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states is intensifying. Karen's young beau, Dov Landau, is recruited into the [[Irgun]], a radical pro-Zionist militant group. Ari Ben Canaan's uncle, Akiva, who heads the Irgun, first interviews Dov. Before swearing him in, Akiva forces Dov into confessing he was a [[Sonderkommando]] in [[Auschwitz]] and was [[Sodomy|sodomized]] by the Nazi camp guards; this is where Dov acquired his bomb expertise. Akiva's violent activities run counter to his brother Barak, Ari's father, who heads the mainstream [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], working to create a Jewish state [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|through political and diplomatic means]]. Barak fears the Irgun will derail these efforts, especially as the British have placed a price on Akiva's head.\n\nKaren goes to live at Gan Dafna, a fictional Jewish [[kibbutz]] near [[Mount Tabor]] near the [[moshav]] where Ari was raised.<ref>An actual kibbutz named [[Dafna]] is located near the present [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border.</ref> Kitty and Ari have fallen in love, but Kitty pulls back, feeling like an outsider after meeting Ari's family and learning about his previous love: Dafna, a young woman kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by Arabs, who is the namesake of the Gan Dafna kibbutz.\n\nAri helps locate Karen's father, Dr. Clement, who is a permanent in-patient at a mental hospital in [[Jerusalem]]. He is in a [[dissociative state]] that is borderline vegetative, caused by the horrors he suffered in the past while in a Nazi concentration camp. When Karen visits, she is devastated that her father does not recognize her.\n\nAkiva is arrested, imprisoned in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] fortress, and sentenced to hang after the Irgun [[King David Hotel bombing|bomb the King David Hotel]]. The British authorities fail to heed a warning of the planned bombing which resulted in dozens of fatalities.  Ari plots an escape to save Akiva's life, and free Haganah and Irgun fighters imprisoned by the British military.  Dov, who eluded capture after the hotel bombing, turns himself in to utilize his bomb-making expertise to facilitate the [[Acre Prison break]].\n\nHundreds of prisoners escape, including Akiva, though he is fatally wounded as he and Ari evade a [[roadblock]]. Ari is also wounded, but makes it to Gan Dafna where Dr. Lieberman removes a bullet from Ari. With the British on Ari's trail, he is taken to Abu Yesha, an Arab village near Gan Dafna, where his lifelong Arab friend, Taha, is the ''[[mukhtar]]''. When a recovering Ari develops a life-threatening infection, Kitty saves his life. This rekindles their romance. Meanwhile, the British arrest Dr. Lieberman when they find an illegal weapons cache hidden within the children's village.\n\nAn independent Israel is now in sight, but Arab nationals commanded by [[Amin al-Husseini|Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], plot to attack Gan Dafna and massacre the Jews, including the children. Taha warns Ari of the impending attack, though he reluctantly says he must join the Grand Mufti in fighting the establishment of Israel. Ben Canaan orders the younger children be evacuated to safety during the night as a small detachment of [[Palmach]] troops arrives to reinforce Gan Dafna's defenses.\n\nKaren, ecstatic over the prospect of the new nation, goes to find Dov (who is on night patrol at the Gan Dafna perimeter) and proclaims her love for him. Dov says they will marry when the war is over. As Karen returns to Gan Dafna, she is ambushed and murdered by Arabs. Dov discovers her lifeless body the following morning. The same day, Taha's body is found hanging in his village, killed by the Grand Mufti. A [[Star of David]] is carved into his body and a [[swastika]] and signs saying \"Jude\" are on village walls.\n\nKaren and Taha are buried together in one grave. Ari eulogizes them, saying that someday Jews and Arabs will share the land in peace. While others in turn add a shovelful of dirt to the grave, Dov, angry and heartbroken, bypasses the shovel and moves on. Ari, Kitty, Dov, and a Palmach contingent board trucks, heading off to the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|battle]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Ari Ben Canaan\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Kitty Fremont\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as Gen.

Although filming key elements of ''Exodus'' on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus was authentic, as it was the location of the British internment camps for Jewish refugees trying to reach [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], it was difficult, as the island was in the middle of a Greek insurgency against British rule, led by the Greek nationalist organisation [[EOKA]]. EOKA was considered a terrorist organisation by the British authorities in Cyprus, who were opposed to the filming of a movie on the island that seemed to combine anti-British sentiments with a storyline that appeared to show terrorist action could be successful. As a result, the British authorities refused to help Preminger with the logistical side of filming. The only assistance given by the British authorities was the placement of an armed guard on the large number of decommissioned rifles used as props in the film, to prevent them from falling into the hands of EOKA and being recommissioned.<ref>Tony Shaw, ''Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2014) p. 67</ref>\n\nRelations between the director and actors were difficult, particularly with the male lead, [[Paul Newman]].<ref>Foster Hirsch, ''Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King'' (New York: Knopf, 2007)</ref> After Newman's suggested changes to the script were rejected by Preminger, and the actor given a dressing down for making the suggestions, Newman hid a [[mannequin]] on a high balcony on which he was due to play out a fight scene. At the end of the scene, Newman pretended to stumble, and threw the mannequin over the balcony. Not realising this was a practical joke, Preminger collapsed and required medical attention. At other times, Preminger and Newman were barely on speaking terms.<ref>A. E. Hotchner, ''Paul and Me: 53 Years of Adventures and Misadventures with Paul Newman'' (London: Simon & Schuster, 2014)</ref>\n\nUris was originally signed to write a screenplay of the film, but Preminger rejected his script as excessively anti-British and anti-Arab. Preminger instead hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo, with whom he collaborated on a script in forty days. Trumbo had never visited Israel, resulted in initial errors, such as locating the site of the Acre prison break, located in a coastal city, as taking place in the middle of the desert. Trumbo also made fewer use of Blblical themes than Uris wanted. His biographer wrote that Trumbo refused \"to go back to Old Testament times, and follow the Jews through the centuries of the [[Diaspora]] and the horror of the Holocaust.\" Trumbo and Preminger did not share Uris's preoccupation with history as moulding the Israeli national character.<ref>Silver, p. 202</ref>\n\nPaul Newman and Eva Marie Saint had previously appeared together as the teenage lovers who subsequently marry in a 1955 musical version of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[Our Town (Producer's Showcase)|Our Town]]'' with [[Frank Sinatra]] as the stage manager, an episode of the anthology television series ''[[Producer's Showcase]]''. Newman and Saint sing a duet during the malt shop sequence.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as a \"dazzling, eye-filling, nerve-tingling display of a wide variety of individual and mass reactions to awesome challenges and, in some of its sharpest personal details, a fine reflection of experience that rips the heart.\" The film's \"principal weakness,\" Crowther wrote, \"is that it has so much churning around in it that no deep or solid stream of interest evolves\u2014save a vague rooting interest in the survival of all the nice people involved.\"<ref name=\"crowther\">Crowther, Bosley (December 16, 1960).

Part III, p. 9.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared, \"There is room to criticize 'Exodus'\u2014its length might be shortened to advantage; perhaps Preminger tried to crowd too much incident from the book for dramatic clarity, and some individual scenes could be sharpened through tighter editing.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. December 14, 1960. 6.</ref>\n\n[[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the film \"has this vitality of the immediate and will be of incalculable influence in reaching those unfamiliar with the background of Israel ...

G1.</ref> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"''Exodus'' lacks the historical imagination to cope with its theme on one level, the human awareness to dramatise it on the other. At the end of three and a half hours, its approach remains more exhausting than exhaustive. And the determination to be fair to all sides\u2014almost the only character the script is prepared to dislike is the ''Nazi'' leader of the Arab terrorists\u2014produces some strange consequences.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=June 1961 |title=Exodus |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=28 |issue=329 |page=75 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Angell]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, \"Such a bubbling pot of intrigue, violence, and hatred would almost seem to guarantee a lively film, but Mr. Preminger has approached his task with a painstaking reverence that would have been more suitable if he had been filming [[Book of Exodus|the original work of this title]]. He permits nearly everyone in his large cast to state his ideological and political convictions before and after each new turn of events, and the result is an awesome talkfest that is all too rarely interrupted by the popping of rifles.\"<ref>Angell, Roger (December 17, 1960). \"The Current Cinema\".
