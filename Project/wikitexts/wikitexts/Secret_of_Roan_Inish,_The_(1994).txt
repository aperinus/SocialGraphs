The story, set on the west coast of [[Ulster]] in the north-west of [[Ireland]], is about Fiona, a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents and her cousin Eamon near the island of Roan Inish, where the selkies are rumored to reside. It is a family legend that her younger brother was swept away in his infancy and raised by a selkie. Part of the film takes place in [[Donegal Town]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 1946, the story is told from the point of view of Fiona (Jeni Courtney), a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents in an Irish fishing village, after the death of her mother, illness of her father, and her own failing health.\n\nIn the evenings, her grandfather tells tales about the family's history, including the evacuation from their generational home on the tiny island of Roan Inish during the [[Second World War]]. Known in [[Irish language|Irish]] as ''R\u00f3n Inis'', meaning \"Island of [[pinniped|Seals]]\", Roan Inish is a real location near [[Narin, County Donegal|Narin]], a village on the west coast of [[County Donegal]] in the west of [[Ulster]].\n\nThey live in the Ireland of tiny fishing villages, places where everyone knows one another. People live close to nature, and animals are respected and live alongside the villagers. Seals are especially respected for their special human-like spirit. It is said to be terribly wrong to harm a seal.\n\nAs she meets other villagers, Fiona hears from a distant cousin about an ancestor who married a beautiful Selkie (seal-woman). The story goes that although theirs was a marriage full of happiness, success and many children, there was always the mysterious seal-bond to the ocean. Fiona's cousin tells her that the selkie's blood runs through some of the descendants, he himself is called a \"dark\", down through the generations, like himself, and Fiona's baby brother Jamie.\n\nFiona hears details about how the sea seemed to steal her infant brother, Jamie, during the departure from Roan Inish, bobbing out of sight in his little cradle boat, some years earlier, never to be seen again.\n\nHer cousin, Eamon, who also lives near the grandparents for his health, often accompanies the Grandfather in his [[Currach|curragh]] - fishing boat - on daily errands to the islands including Roan Inish. Quickly the bright and older Eamon becomes a partner in Fiona's plans, as the day's adventures on the sea and shore become more interesting.\n\nSoon, on one of the visits to Roan Inish, Fiona believes that she has found Jamie romping on the strand and again, in the grass. She confides in Eamon, who warns her to not tell the grandparents for now. She observes that the seals seem to care for him, helping to feed him and play with him.\n\nThey get the idea that her grandparents should move back to Roan Inish and, when they do, the seals will return Jamie to them. The grandparents' current landlord is selling their home and they will need to move soon, but won't move to Roan Inish due to the sadness they feel at losing Jamie. Without telling them, Fiona and Eamon reason: if they must move again, why not back to the cottages they loved best?\n\nSaying nothing to anyone about their plan, Fiona and Eamon set to the hard work of reclaiming the long-abandoned cottages on Roan Inish. They clean and restore the cottages, give them new [[Thatching|thatch]], paint, gardens, and furnishings.\n\nAfter returning to her grandparents, a terrible storm rises and Fiona fears for Jamie's safety in the strong winds. She wonders aloud: \"I hope he thinks to go inside the cottage.\" Her grandparents hear her and are in utter disbelief at her explanation.\n\nHer grandmother is wise and unhesitant - rising to her feet and to the moment, her body and actions say: If there is any chance the child lives, when thought dead these years, rescue must be immediate.\n\nShe gathers her husband, Eamon and Fiona, they pack what they need, and climb into the curragh and make their way to Roan Inish. Racing inside, they see that Jamie is not there and the wind is rising in power and the rain has begun. The grandparents are, however, astonished and grateful to Fiona and Eamon for their secret restoration of the cottages these past few weeks.\n\nJamie's tiny cradle bobs to shore and he jumps out, heading for the cottages to escape the storm, shepherded to safety lovingly by the seals, as they'd probably been doing all along. But then he stops and runs back - he sees his grandparents and Eamon and Fiona, his big sister, and has no memory of them. In front of the group, grandmother calls to him to not be afraid and to come to them for love and safety - come to his family at last. Jamie remains motionless and afraid, still, then runs for his cradle, but at this point several of the seals herd him towards his family, and prevent him from returning to the cradle boat and the sea. He reluctantly makes his way into his grandmother's open arms and they make their way inside. Seeing that Jamie is safe, the seals depart.\n\nIndoors, the victorious family are elated at the return of the child they thought dead. They wrap Jamie in a blanket and sit in front of a warm dry fire. Fiona rocks him to sleep in her arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jeni Courtney]] as Fiona Coneelly\n* [[Eileen Colgan]] as Tess Coneelly\n* Richard Sheridan as Eamon Coneelly\n* [[Dave Duffy]] as Jim\n* [[Pat Slowey]] as Priest\n* [[Declan Hannigan]] as Oldest brother\n* [[Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Ghallch\u00f3ir]] as Barmaid\n* [[Eugene McHugh]] as Bar Patron 1\n* [[Tony Rubini]] as Bar Patron 2\n* [[Mick Lally]] as Hugh Coneelly\n* [[Michael MacCarthaigh]] as Schoolmaster\n* [[Fergal McElherron]] as Sean Michael\n* [[Brendan Conroy]] as Flynn Conneelly\n* [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] as Tadhg Coneelly\n* [[Susan Lynch]] as Nuala the Selkie\n* [[Frankie McCafferty]] as Tim\n* [[Cillian Byrne]] as Jamie Connelly\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn creating the film, John Sayles drew on original research of Celtic island lore and language, including the Blasket memoirs, a series of vernacular memoirs collected in the 1920s and '30s from residents of the [[Great Blasket Island|Great Blasket]], an island off the [[County Kerry|Kerry]] coast evacuated by the Irish government in 1953 and made a national park in 1989.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Graham |first=Kathryn |author-link=Kathryn Graham|title=Seaweed Soup: The Secret (ingredients) of Roan Inish|url=https://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/ojs/index.php/tlg/article/view/287/284|magazine=The Looking Glass: New Perspectives on Children's Literature|date=December 2000 |access-date=December 30, 2017|quote=\u2026&nbsp; Among these works are Tomas O'Crohan's ''The Islandman'', Sean O'Crohan's ''A Day in Our Life'', and Peig Sayers's ''An Old Woman's Reflections''.&nbsp;\u2026\u2019 }}</ref>\n\n\"Veteran cinematographer [[Haskell Wexler]] gives ''The Secret of Roan Inish'' an effortlessly elemental look.
