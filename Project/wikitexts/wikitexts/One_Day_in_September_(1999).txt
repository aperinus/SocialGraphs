[[Michael Douglas]] provides the sparse [[narration]] throughout the film.\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the 72nd Academy Awards, on 26 March 2000.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-HL7b3ae8E Documentary Winners: 2000 Oscars]</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe documentary begins with an advertisement by the [[Munich]] Tourism Bureau with a beautiful young girl inviting the world to visit the city for the Olympics, then shows interviews with the wives of some of the murdered athletes, including Ankie Spitzer, widow of fencing coach [[Andre Spitzer]]. The film also features the first known filmed interview with [[Jamal Al-Gashey]], a surviving terrorist. Al-Gashey, who is in hiding in [[Africa]], wears a cap and sunglasses and his face is slightly blurred.\n\nThere are various shots of the Games getting under way, and attention is given to the lax security the Germans had at the Games. The terrorists are seen preparing for the assault; Al-Gashey claims that he and the other members were trained in [[Libya]] before going to [[West Germany]] to begin the assault.\n\nThe assault is described by Al-Gashey as well as by some of the German security staff present. Footage of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] anchor [[Jim McKay]] is interspersed, along with sound clips of [[Peter Jennings]], to give an impression of events unfolding as they happened. General [[Ulrich Wegener]], founder of the German counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]], was also interviewed during the film, and was roundly criticized for his seemingly flippant attitude about the subject matter.\n\nThe film offers evidence supporting the allegation that the [[Munich Massacre#Failed rescue|rescue operation]] was poorly planned and executed; for instance, the German police aboard the getaway aeroplane voted to abandon their mission without consulting the central command, while the snipers were not prepared and were poorly positioned. The film implies that had the German government prepared better, the athletes might have been saved. Former Mossad Director [[Zvi Zamir]], who was present at the airport during the final gunfight, is interviewed about his views on the failed rescue (he had previously been interviewed on this subject in an NBC profile of the Munich massacre broadcast during the Barcelona Olympics). At the end of the section, graphic photographs of the dead Israelis and Palestinians are shown in a photo-montage set to the [[Deep Purple]] song \"[[Child in Time]]\".\n\nThe film also alleges that the 29 October [[Lufthansa Flight 615|hijacking of a Lufthansa jet]] and the subsequent release of the three surviving Black September members in exchange for the hostages was a set-up by the German government, who did not want their failings to be made obvious in the trial.\n\n==Reception==\n\nAfter the film's release, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] penned a review recommending the film, stating that it \"grips the attention and is exciting and involving. I recommend it on that basis--and also because of the new information it contains\". He also stated that \"Macdonald brings remarkable research to the film\" and \"he relentlessly builds up a case against the way the Germans and the International Olympic Committee handled the crisis.\" However, Ebert criticized the style of the film, and the film's \"tasteless conclusion\", which included a montage of action shots and photos of victims' corpses with a rock music score.\n\n==Concerns about screenings for Academy Awards==\n[[Roger Ebert]] continued his criticisms after the film received an Academy Award,<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2000 2000|Oscars.org]</ref> claiming that the producer, [[Arthur Cohn]], intentionally subverts the Academy's documentary and foreign film by-laws \u2013  which dictate that only members who have seen all nominated films may vote \u2013 by limiting screenings of his films to a small group of invited people. \"By limiting those who have seen his, Cohn shrinks the voting pool and improves his odds.\"<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010309/REVIEWS/103090303/1023|title=One Day in September |access-date=2007-07-01 |work=rogerebert.com }}</ref>\n\n[[Joe Berlinger]], director of the documentaries ''Brother's Keeper'' and ''Paradise Lost'', joined Ebert in criticizing Arthur Cohn's method of screening his films, but stressed that the problem is the Academy by-laws: \"Until there is a documentary branch of the Academy that treats docs like any other film in any other category, nothing will change, despite the recent band-aid attempt to improve the situation.\"<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000423/ANSWERMAN/4230305/1023 |title=Answer Man Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=2008-10-01 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606012936/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20000423%2FANSWERMAN%2F4230305%2F1023 |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Munich '72 and Beyond]]'' <!-- another documentary about the Munich massacre -->\n* ''[[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]]'' (2005)\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Companion book==\n* [[Simon Reeve (British TV presenter)|Reeve, Simon]] (New York, 2001), ''One Day in September: the full story of the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre and the Israeli operation 'Wrath of God' '' {{ISBN|1-55970-547-7}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.passion-pictures.com/films/project/one-day-in-september/ ''One Day in September''] at [[Passion Pictures]]\n* {{BFI}}\n* {{BBFC title|AFF161585|One Day in September}} \n* {{IMDb title|id=0230591|title=One Day in September}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|title=One Day in September}}\n\n{{Kevin Macdonald}}\n{{AcademyAwardBestDocumentaryFeature1981-2000}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]\n[[Category:Munich massacre]]\n[[Category:Films set in Munich]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Macdonald (director)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alex Heffes]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Olympics]]\n[[Category:Films about the 1972 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:1999 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Battsek]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:British sports documentary films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
