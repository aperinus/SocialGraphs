It is based on the Chinese legend of [[Hua Mulan]], and was Disney's 36th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|animated feature]] and the ninth animated film produced and released during the [[Disney Renaissance]]. It was directed by [[Barry Cook]] and [[Tony Bancroft]], with story by [[Robert D. San Souci]] and screenplay by Rita Hsiao, [[Chris Sanders]], [[Philip LaZebnik]], Raymond Singer, and Eugenia Bostwick-Singer. [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Miguel Ferrer]] and [[BD Wong]] star in the English version, while [[Jackie Chan]] provided the voice of Captain Li Shang for the Chinese dubs of the film. The film's plot takes place in China during an unspecified Imperial dynasty, where [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]], daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou, impersonates a man to take her father's place during a general conscription to counter a [[Xiongnu|Hun]] invasion.\n\n''Mulan'' was the first of three features produced primarily at the Disney animation studio at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) in [[Bay Lake, Florida]]. Development for the film began in 1994, when a number of artistic supervisors were sent to China to receive artistic and cultural inspiration. ''Mulan'' was well received by critics and the public who praised the animation, plot, characters (particularly the title character), and musical score, and grossed over $304&nbsp;million. It earned a [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award]] nomination and won several [[Annie Awards]], including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]. It was then followed by a [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Mulan II]]'' in 2004. A [[Mulan (2020 film)|live-action adaptation]] directed by [[Niki Caro]] was released on September 4, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/08/mulan-new-release-date-disney-earnings-call-1203003942/|title='Mulan' Going On Disney+ & Theaters in September; CEO Bob Chepak Says Decision Is A \"One-Off\", Not New Windows Model|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=August 4, 2020|access-date=August 4, 2020|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804233521/https://deadline.com/2020/08/mulan-new-release-date-disney-earnings-call-1203003942/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n[[Image:Mulan Screenshot.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Cri-Kee; [[Mushu]]; [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]; Khan]]\n\nThe [[Xiongnu|Huns]], who are led by the ruthless [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Shan Yu|Shan Yu]], invade imperial China by breaching the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. In the Imperial City, the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] orders a general mobilization, with [[conscription]] notices requiring one man from each family to join the [[Imperial Chinese Army]]. To the South, [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]] is an adventurous and active young woman to the dismay of her family, who hope for her to bring honor to the family. She is arranged to meet a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future  wife; but following a few mishaps, the matchmaker deems her a disgrace to the family.\n\nMulan's elderly father Fa Zhou - the only man in their family and an army veteran - is conscripted into the army. She tries to dissuade him from going, but he protests that he must do his duty. Fearing for his life, she cuts her hair and takes her father's sword and armor, disguising herself as a man so that she can enlist in his stead. Quickly learning of her departure, Mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors for Mulan's safety. In the local temple, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]], a small red [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], is a disgraced former [[Chinese guardian lions|family guardian]] who is demoted to the role of awakening the spirits of the ancestors. The ''Great Ancestor'' decides that the \"most powerful of all,\" a massive stone dragon guardian, should guide Mulan; and sends Mushu to wake him. After accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, Mushu travels to Mulan's aid himself, desiring to redeem himself to the ancestors by making Mulan a war hero.\n\nReporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named \"Fa Ping\", with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance throughout her deception. Under the command of Captain [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|Li Shang]], she and her fellow recruits\u2014including Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po\u2014gradually become trained soldiers, but the Emperor's belligerent counsel, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Chi-Fu|Chi-Fu]], threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang's men to fight. Mushu then crafts a fake letter from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out and arrive at a burnt village, discovering that the Huns have massacred General Li and his troops.\n\nAs the soldiers march up a mountain pass, they are ambushed by the Huns. Mulan cleverly uses a [[Huolongchushui]] cannon to cause an [[avalanche]], which buries the entire Hun army. Angered, Shan Yu wounds Mulan during the battle, and her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life and expels her from the army. Mulan is left behind as the other soldiers depart for the Imperial City to report the Huns' defeat. However, Shan Yu and several of his warriors have survived, and Mulan sees them heading towards the city.\n\nMulan enters the city and warns Shang. The Huns then capture the Emperor and seize the palace. Mulan, Yao, Ling, Chien-Po, and Shang enter the palace and defeat Shan Yu's men. Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, and Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she pins him there with his own sword. Acting on Mulan's instructions, Mushu fires a large [[skyrocket]] at Shan Yu; the rocket strikes and propels Shan Yu into a [[fireworks]] launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe Emperor initially reprimands Mulan, but then he and the city's assembled inhabitants praise her for having saved them, and they bow to her in honor. She accepts the Emperor's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but politely declines his offer to be on his royal council and asks to return to her family. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he is happy to have her back. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang also arrives and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian as the ancestors celebrate.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Ming-Na Wen - Guardians of the Galaxy premiere - July 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Eddie Murphy Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg\n| image3 = BDWongNYCJune08.jpg\n| image4 = Miguel Ferrer at the NCIS LA Season 7 Premiere as part of Paleyfest Previews - DSC 0404 (20743137643).jpg\n| footer = Top row (L\u2013R): [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Eddie Murphy]]<br />Bottom row (L\u2013R): [[BD Wong]], [[Miguel Ferrer]]\n}}\n{{Main|List of Disney's Mulan characters}}\n* [[Ming-Na Wen]] as [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]] (singing voice provided by [[Lea Salonga]])\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Mushu]]\n* [[BD Wong]] as Captain Li Shang (singing voice provided by [[Donny Osmond]])\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Shan Yu|Shan Yu]], the Hun chieftain\n* [[June Foray]] as Grandmother Fa (singing voice provided by [[Marni Nixon]])\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Yao\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Ling (singing voice provided by [[Matthew Wilder]])\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as Chien-Po\n* [[James Hong]] as Chi-Fu\n* [[Soon-Tek Oh]] as Fa Zhou\n* [[Pat Morita]] as The Emperor of China\n* [[George Takei]] as First Ancestor\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as The Matchmaker\n* [[Freda Foh Shen]] as Fa Li\n* [[James Shigeta]] as General Li\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Cri-Kee, Khan (Mulan's horse)\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as Little Brother (Mulan's dog)\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] as various ancestors\n\n[[Kelly Chen]], [[Coco Lee]] and [[Xu Qing]] voiced Mulan in the [[Cantonese]], [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mainland standard]] versions of the film respectively, while [[Jackie Chan]] provided the voice of Li Shang in all three Chinese versions and appeared in the version of promotional music videos of \"[[I'll Make a Man Out of You]]\".

Director Barry Cook explained that the sequence initially started as a song storyboarded by Barry Johnson and redrawn by character designer Chen-Yi Chang. Following the story changes to have Mulan leave to save her father, the song was dropped. Storyboard artist and co-head of story [[Dean DeBlois]] was tasked to revise the sequence, and decided to board the sequence with \"minimal dialogue\".{{sfn|Kurtti|1998|pp=173\u201375}} Assisted with an existing musical selection from another film score courtesy of Sanders, the sequence reel was screened for [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] and Thomas Schumacher, both of whom were impressed.
