The film narrates the life of composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (played by Oldman) in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s while it follows Beethoven's secretary and first biographer [[Anton Schindler]]'s (Krabb\u00e9) quest to ascertain the true identity of the ''Unsterbliche Geliebte'' ([[Immortal Beloved]]) addressed in three letters found in the late composer's private papers. Schindler journeys throughout the [[Austrian Empire]] interviewing women who might be potential candidates, as well as through Beethoven's own tumultuous life.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] dies, his assistant and close friend [[Anton Schindler|Schindler]] deals with his last will and testament. It reads that his estate, music and affairs will be left to his \"immortal beloved,\" but there remains a question as to who is Beethoven's \"immortal beloved,\" an unnamed woman mentioned in one of his letters. Schindler embarks on a quest to find out and meets the women who he knew had played a part in Ludwig's life.\n\nSchindler first meets with Giulietta Giucciardi, who became a piano student of Beethoven's when she was a wealthy, young unmarried woman and fell in love with him. Despite Giulietta's father disapproving, she intends to marry Beethoven. She attempts to prove to her father that, despite rumors to the contrary, Beethoven can still play music himself, and hides with him while the composer plays the piano forte, believing he is alone. When he discovers Giulietta and her father, he is furious, feeling betrayed. He cuts ties with her and storms out. She calls after him to apologize, and only then realizes that Beethoven is deaf.\n\nSchindler next meets Anna-Marie Erd\u00f6dy, who took Beethoven in after becoming outraged with the audience mocking him at a poor performance, as the composer, now completely deaf, had become unable to properly conduct the orchestra. Anna-Marie's young son is killed during Napoleon's attack on Vienna and Beethoven comforts her in her grief, leading to a love affair, but she denies being his \"immortal beloved.\"\n\nSchindler's investigation brings him back to Beethoven's own family, recounting his disapproval of his brother marrying [[Johanna van Beethoven|Johanna Reiss]], the daughter of Anton Van Reiss, a prosperous Viennese upholsterer, even attempting to have her arrested at one point. After his brother's death, Beethoven is able to seize custody of his nephew Karl. Even though the boy is indifferent to music, his uncle becomes obsessed with making him a composer, neglecting his own career, which suffers.\n\nKarl grows into a teenager, having spent hours daily practicing the piano. Beethoven is convinced that Karl will be a great success as a composer, but Karl knows he has no talent and, pushed to his breaking point by his uncle, attempts suicide. He survives but tells Beethoven he never wants to see him again.\n\nSchindler discovers that Beethoven's great love was Johanna, and that Karl, conceived before her marriage, is actually his son, not his nephew. They had intended to elope, but Beethoven was delayed and wrote the \"immortal beloved\" letter to Johanna to let her know. However, Johanna never received it and, believing Beethoven had abandoned her, left and married his brother instead. Both feeling betrayed, their love grew to hate. Johanna tells Schindler that when she saw the performance of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|his ninth symphony]], she was moved to forgive him and ultimately made peace with him on his deathbed, where he gave her a signed letter, giving her custody over Karl.\n\nSchindler gives Johanna the letter to the \"Immortal Beloved\" in which she finally reads what happened that night they were supposed to meet. Shocked to find out how an unfortunate event and misunderstanding has kept them apart, she visits Beethoven's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] \n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as [[Anton Felix Schindler]] \n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as [[Anna-Marie Erd\u00f6dy]] \n* [[Johanna ter Steege]] as [[Johanna van Beethoven|Johanna Reiss]]\n* [[Christopher Fulford]] as [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar van Beethoven]] \n* [[Michael Culkin]] as Jakob Hotscevar\n* [[Marco Hofschneider]] as Karl van Beethoven\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Nanette Streicherova \n* [[Barry Humphries]] as [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Clemens Metternich]] \n* [[Valeria Golino]] as [[Giulietta Guicciardi]]\n* [[Alexandra Pigg]] as Therese Obermayer\n* [[Geno Lechner]] as [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine von Brunsvik]]\n* [[Claudia Solti]] as [[Ter\u00e9z Brunszvik|Theresa von Brunsvik]]\n\n==Historical background==\n{{Main|Immortal Beloved}}\n\nAfter Beethoven's death in 1827, a three-part letter was found among his private papers addressed to a woman whom he called \"immortal beloved\". Written in the summer of 1812 from the spa town of [[Teplice]], the letter has generated a great deal of speculation and debate among scholars and writers as to her identity. Among the candidates, then and now, are [[Giulietta Guicciardi]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se von Brunsvik]], [[Josephine Brunsvik]], [[Antonie Brentano]], and [[Anna-Marie Erd\u00f6dy]], some of whom are portrayed in the film.\n\nThe film's writer and director, [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]], though not a historian, claimed that he had successfully identified the addressed woman as Beethoven's sister-in-law [[Johanna van Beethoven|Johanna (Reiss) van Beethoven]], a claim no scholar on Beethoven has endorsed. The film also implies that Karl, Beethoven's nephew, was in reality the couple's son. Biographer [[Gail S. Altman]] disputed Rose's claim in a book<ref>Altman, Gail S. ''Beethoven: A Man of His Word \u2013 Undisclosed Evidence for his Immortal Beloved'', Anubian Press 1996; {{ISBN|1-888071-01-X}}</ref> devoted specifically to the question of the woman's identity and Beethoven's relationships in general.<ref>See also Lewis Lockwood: \"Film Biography as Travesty: ''[[Immortal Beloved]]'' and Beethoven.\" ''The Musical Quarterly'' 81/2, 1997, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013198.</ref>\n\n==Music==\n* The Orchestra: [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Georg Solti]]\n* Instrumental soloists\n** [[Murray Perahia]], piano\n** [[Gidon Kremer]], violin\n* [[Juilliard String Quartet]]\n(in order of appearance)\n* Symphony No 5, Op. 67.
