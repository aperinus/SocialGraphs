Directed by [[Sam Mendes]] and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], and [[Jez Butterworth]], it stars [[Daniel Craig]] as Bond, alongside [[Christoph Waltz]], [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]], [[Ben Whishaw]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Monica Bellucci]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. In the film, Bond learns of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]], an international crime organisation led by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] (Waltz).\n\nDespite initially stating he would not direct ''Spectre'', Mendes confirmed his return in 2014 after [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] declined to direct; Mendes became the first to direct successive ''James Bond'' films since [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]]. The inclusion of Spectre and its associated characters marked the end of the [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|''Thunderball'' controversy]], in which [[Kevin McClory]] and Fleming were embroiled in lengthy legal disputes over the film rights to the novel; ''Spectre'' is the first film to feature these elements since ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971). Following the [[Sony Pictures hack]], it was revealed Sony and Eon clashed regarding finance, stunts, and filming locations; ''Spectre'' is estimated to have a final budget of $245\u2013300 million, making it [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]]. [[Principal photography]] began in December 2014 and lasted until July 2015, with filming locations including Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco, and Mexico.\n\n''Spectre'' premiered at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 26 October 2015 and was theatrically released in conventional and [[IMAX]] formats in the United Kingdom that day, and in the United States on 6 November.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | title=Ikon London Magazine Coverage from the world premiere of Spectre | publisher=Ikon London Magazine | date=27 October 2015 | access-date=3 March 2018 | archive-date=6 April 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406173042/https://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/spectre-world-premiere-at-the-royal-albert-hall-london/ | url-status=live }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Craig's and Bautista's), and the musical score, but criticised the pacing and formulaic narrative decisions. It grossed $880 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest grossing film of 2015]] and the second-highest grossing ''James Bond'' film after ''[[Skyfall]]'', [[Inflation|unadjusted]] for inflation. The film's theme song, \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing's on the Wall]]\", won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song. The next film in the series, ''[[No Time to Die]]'', was released in 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- FILM PLOTS should be no more than 700 words, so please do not add to this summary unless you can keep the word count below that figure. -->[[MI6]] agent James Bond carries out an unauthorised mission in [[Mexico City]] on the [[Day of the Dead]], where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus, before stealing a helicopter to escape.\n\nUpon his return to [[London]], Bond is suspended from field duty by [[Gareth Mallory]], the current M, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, [[private intelligence agency|privately backed]] Joint Intelligence Service formed by the merger of [[MI5]] and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"Nine Eyes\", and uses his influence to close down the [[00 Agent|'00']] field agent section, which he believes is outdated. In private, Bond tells [[Miss Moneypenny|Eve Moneypenny]] that he went to Mexico to target Sciarra after receiving a video message from the previous M that was delivered to him after her death. Moneypenny agrees to assist Bond behind M's back.\n\nBond disobeys M's orders and travels to [[Rome]] to attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the \"Pale King\" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. Moneypenny informs Bond that the Pale King is [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a former member of the organisation's subsidiary Quantum, who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead 20 years earlier.\n\nBond locates White in [[Altaussee]], Austria, where he is dying of [[thallium poisoning]]. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist [[Madeleine Swann]], who will take him to L'Am\u00e9ricain in order to locate Oberhauser. White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying [[Le Chiffre]], [[Dominic Greene (James Bond)|Dominic Greene]] and [[Raoul Silva]] as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as [[SPECTRE|Spectre]].\n\nSwann takes Bond to L'Am\u00e9ricain, a hotel in [[Tangier]], and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the [[Sahara]]. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight, and later they are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counteract investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history. After Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Jealous of his father's affection for Bond, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], went on to form Spectre and target Bond, and contributed to several tragedies in Bond's life, including the deaths of [[Vesper Lynd]] and the previous M. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch in his face, and escape to London to prevent the Nine Eyes from going online.\n\nIn London, Bond and Swann meet M, Q, [[Bill Tanner]] and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are separately abducted by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old [[SIS Building|MI6 building]], scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012)}} Blofeld\u2014badly scarred on the right side of his face\u2014tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated in three minutes, or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto [[Westminster Bridge]]. Blofeld manages to crawl away from the wreckage and dares Bond to kill him, but Bond refuses, leaving him to be arrested by M. He then reunites with Swann and the two depart.\n\nLater, Bond acquires his rebuilt Aston Martin DB5 from Q and drives away with Swann.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], agent 007.
