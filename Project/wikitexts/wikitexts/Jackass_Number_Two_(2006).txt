It is the sequel to ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'' (2002), both based upon the [[MTV]] series ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''. Like its predecessor and the original television show, the film is a compilation of stunts, pranks and skits, starring the regular ''Jackass'' cast of [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Bam Margera]], [[Ryan Dunn]], [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]], [[Dave England]], [[Chris Pontius]], [[Steve-O]], [[Preston Lacy]], and [[Ehren McGhehey]].\n\nProduced by [[MTV Films]], [[Jackass (franchise)|Dickhouse Productions]] and Lynch Siderow Productions, and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], the film premiered in theaters on September 22, 2006, received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $84.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $11.5 million.\n\nUnused material of the film was released as a separate movie titled ''Jackass 2.5'' online on December 19, 2007, and on [[DVD]] on December 26, 2007.<ref name=Jackass>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071213-jackass-2-5s-biggest-stunt-skipping-the-box-office.html|title=Jackass 2.5's biggest stunt: skipping the box office|work=Ars Technica|date=December 13, 2007|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> It was followed by another sequel, ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' (2010).\n\n==Synopsis==\nA compilation of various stunts, pranks and skits, the film opens by introducing the primary cast members while bulls chase them in a suburban neighborhood.\n\nThe most notable stunts include; [[Johnny Knoxville]] sitting on a big red rocket which gets launched into the air, [[Bam Margera]] being stuck in a trailer with a [[cobra]], [[Chris Pontius]]' penis dressed as a mouse while a snake attempts to bite it, [[Steve-O]] getting his cheek pierced by a [[fish hook]] and getting thrown into the [[shark]] infested [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Ryan Dunn]] being launched into a garage door while riding a shopping cart, [[Dave England]] riding a giant firehose that launches him into a patch of mud, [[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]] getting zapped by an electric stool upon believing that cards are being thrown at him, [[Ehren McGhehey]] attempting the loop while riding a [[pocketbike]], and [[Preston Lacy]] disguising himself as [[Phil Margera|Bam's father]] to spoon with [[April Margera|Bam's mother]] in bed.\n\nThe final bit is a prank orchestrated by the cast on Ehren McGhehey in which he dresses up as a terrorist along with [[cinematographer]] Dimitry Elyashkevich, and take a taxi to the airport and convince the driver that they are going to blow up a plane. In reality, the driver is swapped with director [[Jay Chandrasekhar]], who becomes violent with Ehren when he attempts to initiate the prank. The taxi pulls into a lot where a panicked Ehren is forced into the trunk and Jay drives around the lot in circles. When the car comes to a stop, Ehren is relieved to discover that it is a prank and was not in serious danger. However, it is also revealed to Ehren that the beard that was put on him as part of the bit was made up of [[pubic hair]] by a majority of the cast and crew, one of whom happened to have [[Pediculosis pubis|crabs]], after which Ehren gets angry and dry heaves.\n\nThe movie concludes with Johnny Knoxville putting his hand in a [[Trapping|bear trap]], before transitioning into a performance by the main cast in a [[Busby Berkeley|Busby Berkeley-style]] movie musical production number set to the ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' song \"The Best of Times\", where the guys sing and dance while performing more stunts. After a wrecking ball hits Knoxville, [[Rip Taylor]] appears to end the movie much like in the predecessor.\n\n==Cast==\nThe entire main cast from ''[[Jackass: The Movie]]'' returned for the sequel.\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Johnny Knoxville]]\n*[[Bam Margera]]\n*[[Chris Pontius]]\n*[[Steve-O]]\n*[[Ryan Dunn]]\n*[[Dave England]]\n*[[Jason Acu\u00f1a|Wee Man]]\n*[[Ehren McGhehey]]\n*[[Preston Lacy]]\n}}\n\n===Guest appearances===\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Brandon DiCamillo]]\n*[[Brandon Novak]]\n*[[April Margera]], [[Phil Margera]] and [[Jess Margera]]\n*[[Loomis Fall]]\n*Stephanie Hodge\n*Mike Kassak\n*Thor Drake\n*Predatory animal experts David Weathers and [[Manny Puig]]\n*Jim Karol\n*[[Mat Hoffman]]\n*[[Tony Hawk]]\n*[[Clyde Singleton]]\n*[[Jason Taylor (American football player)|Jason Taylor]]\n*[[Mark Zupan (sportsman)|Mark Zupan]]\n*[[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]\n*[[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n*[[Ville Valo]]\n*[[Three 6 Mafia]]\n*[[Roger Alan Wade]]\n*[[Rip Taylor]]\n*[[Luke Wilson]]\n*[[Willie Garson]]\n*[[Mike Judge]]\n*Knoxville's daughter Madison can be heard offscreen in the end credits\n}}\n\n=== Crew ===\nCrew members who appear in this movie:\n* Director and producer [[Jeff Tremaine]]\n* Producer [[Spike Jonze]]\n* Executive producer Trip Taylor\n* Co-producer and [[cinematographer]] Dimitry Elyashkevich\n* Co-producer and photographer Sean Cliver\n* Cameramen [[Lance Bangs]], [[Rick Kosick]], Greg \"Guch\" Iguchi, and Mark Rackley\n* Photographer Ben \"Benzo\" Kaller\n* Sound mixer Cordell Mansfield\n* Boom operator Seamus Frawley\n* Art director J.P.

However, due to the scandal surrounding his arrest just prior to the film's release and the nature of the charges against him, all the scenes involving Don Vito were cut.\n\nNotable exceptions are [[Chris Raab|Raab Himself]], who was battling alcoholism and drug addiction at the time, and [[Rake Yohn]], who did however appear in the film's sequel ''[[Jackass 2.5]]''. They both were recurring cast members in the ''Jackass'' TV show and in the first ''Jackass'' movie. Ryan Dunn approached Raab to appear in the movie, however, he declined the offer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Raab |first=Chris |title=Bathroom Break Podcast #14 - Joe Frantz: Filmmaker/Author |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUUDVAHXHVg&t=3910s |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=August 4, 2022 |date=November 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nShooting began on January 30, 2006, and ended on June 23, 2006.<ref name=\"The Wolfie Diaries\">{{Cite web|title=The Wolfie Diaries|url=http://www.jackassmovie.com/| publisher =Paramount Pictures| access-date =April 22, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Dunn2\">{{Cite AV media | people=Dunn, Ryan|date=2006|title=Jackass Number Two DVD, The Making of Jackass Number Two| medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}</ref> The ''Jackass'' cast refused to divulge where they were filming, out of fear of fans interfering with the filming process.  However, they have filmed in [[India]], [[Australia]], [[England]], [[Moscow, Russia|Moscow]] and [[Argentina]]. A few insights were leaked prior to the movie's release by [[Steve-O]] and [[Bam Margera]] via [[Radio Bam]] and [[Loveline]]. Other shootings were [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas]]; [[Key West, Florida]]; [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Miami, Florida]]; [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; [[New York City, New York]]; and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. Even after completing enough footage for ''Number Two'', Knoxville encouraged everyone to stay together and film more stunts (most of these stunts ultimately released with ''2.5''), willing to even put himself at further risk of injury simply because he didn't want to part with the group so soon.\n\nThe stunt \"How to Milk a Horse\" was originally shot for ''[[Wildboyz]]'', but was saved for future use.<ref name=\"Knoxville\">{{Cite AV media | people=Knoxville, Johnny|date=2006|title=Jackass Number Two DVD commentary | medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}</ref> \"The idea to drink the horse semen was not actually planned but was \"in the back of everyone's mind.\"<ref name=\"Tremaine\">{{Cite AV media | people=Tremaine, Jeff|date=2006|title=Jackass Number Two DVD commentary | medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}</ref> To agree to do the stunt, [[Chris Pontius]] asked director [[Jeff Tremaine]] for a full day off of work, but discouraged doing so since Pontius had missed work the day before.<ref name=\"Knoxville, Johnny 2006\">[[Hot 30 Countdown]] interview.

Although they were deleted, some of the deleted scenes are briefly shown in the credits and/or the making of ''Jackass Number Two'' and ''Jackass 2.5''. A short clip of the tooth pull scene appeared in the trailer for ''Jackass Number Two'', a photo of the human Newton's cradle was released, and the entire \"Ignited Farts\" sequence was once available on the Jackass World website, but has since disappeared following the websites closure. A slightly longer clip of the scene was included in the fourth film, ''[[Jackass Forever]]''.\n\n==Screenings and release==\nThe film had 4 different screenings for fans of Jackass and [[MySpace]] users, which was a part of MySpace's \"Black Carpet\" screening. The screenings took place a few days before the movie was released (possibly August). Some of the screenings also had surprise visits by cast and crew. For example, the Pennsylvania screening had director [[Jeff Tremaine]] and cast members [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Bam Margera]].\n\nOn June 15, 2006, [[Yahoo!]] released the first official teaser for the movie.<ref name=\"Jackass Number Two trailer\">{{cite web | title=Yahoo.com | work= Trailer release. | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/feature/jackassnumbertwo.html;_ylt=ApEn3ddKY55TPRRTNwB5b6ZfVXcA}} Retrieved on April 4, 2008.</ref> The stunts in the trailer included Knoxville riding a \"rocket bike\" off a ramp and a blindfolded Knoxville being rammed by a [[yak]].\n\nThe film was released on DVD on December 26, 2006, in its R-rated version in [[4:3|full]] and [[Widescreen|wide]]screen, and in widescreen in the unrated version.<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{cite web | title=Jackass Number Two (Full Screen Edition) | work= DVD Release info. | date= December 26, 2006 | url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JLTRJU/}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Jackass Number Two'' opened on September 22, 2006, in 3,900 screens at 3,059 theaters.
