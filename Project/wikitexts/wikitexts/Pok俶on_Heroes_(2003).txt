Directed by [[Kunihiko Yuyama]] and produced by [[OLM, Inc.]], the film stars the regular television cast of [[Rica Matsumoto]], [[Yuji Ueda]], [[Mayumi Iizuka]], [[Megumi Hayashibara]], [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] and [[Ikue \u014ctani]]. The English adaptation was produced by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] and was released in the United States on May 16, 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=2009 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-6600-1 |edition=3rd |page=213}}</ref> The English version stars the regular television cast of [[Veronica Taylor]], [[Eric Stuart]], [[Rachael Lillis]] and [[Maddie Blaustein]]. The events of the film take place during the [[List of Pok\u00e9mon: Master Quest episodes|fifth season]] of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (TV series)|Pok\u00e9mon anime]].\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Heroes'' focuses on the main characters, Ash, Misty and Brock, continuing their journey through the Johto region; the main location of the film is based on [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. The name given to the city in the film is Alto Mare, meaning \"high sea\" in the [[Italian language]]. Although it is part of the group's adventure in Johto, the film takes place on an island off of the mainland.\n\nOptimum Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD in the UK on May 9, 2011. [[StudioCanal]] released the film along with ''Pok\u00e9mon 4Ever'' on [[Blu-ray]] in the UK as a double feature pack on April 2, 2012, just one day before ''[[Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: Black\u2014Victini and Reshiram and White\u2014Victini and Zekrom]]'' came out on DVD on April 3, 2012. [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] released the film on Blu-ray in the United States along with ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Destiny Deoxys]]'' on May 15, 2011.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the city of {{Nihongo|Alto Mare|\u30a2\u30eb\u30c8\u30de\u30fc\u30ec|Artom\u0101re}}, protected by the dragon siblings [[Latias and Latios]]. Their father, also a Latios, is said to have saved the city from an evil Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and their [[Kabutops]] and [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] whilst transforming the city's streets into canals. The citizens built the Defense Mechanism of Alto Mare (D.M.A. for short) to protect the city if necessary, but have never had to use it. The father Latios died, leaving behind the {{Nihongo|Soul Dew|\u3053\u3053\u308d\u306e\u3057\u305a\u304f|Kokoro no shizuku|lit., \"Heart Drop\"}}, said to contain his own soul and can power the D.M.A.\n\nIn the present day, [[Team Rocket]] agents {{Nihongo|Annie|\u30b6\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc|Zann\u0101}} and {{Nihongo|Oakley|\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Rion}} acquire a book detailing the history of Alto Mare, plotting to control the D.M.A. Ash, [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] are touring by and see an invisible Latias. Annie and Oakley stalk Latias, disguised as a human girl, trying to capture her using their [[Espeon]] and [[Ariados]]. Ash and Pikachu come to the rescue, guiding Latias to safety but she vanishes when Ash's back is turned.\n\nVisiting the museum, the trio meet the curator {{Nihongo|Lorenzo|\u30dc\u30f3\u30b4\u30ec|Bongore|Vongole}} who details Alto Mare's history, the D.M.A., and the evil trainer's fossilized Pok\u00e9mon on display. Ash spots a girl, {{Nihongo|Bianca|\u30ab\u30ce\u30f3|Kanon}}, who resembles Latias' disguise, and chases her across the city, but she does not recognize him. Latias herself appears, guiding Ash and Pikachu to a hidden garden where she and Latios live, protected by Lorenzo and Bianca, his granddaughter. While Pikachu plays with Latias and Latios, Lorenzo shows Ash the Soul Dew, unaware that Annie and Oakley's [[UAV|drone]] has infiltrated the sanctuary.\n\nThat night, Annie and Oakley sneak into the garden, successfully capturing Latios and the Soul Dew, but Latias escapes. Bianca and Lorenzo attempt to stop the thieves from using the D.M.A. but are captured, the Soul Dew and Latios are used to power the machine. Latias goes to Ash for help, with Latios' \"Sight Sharing\" ability allowing them to witness the events in the museum. Oakley becomes power hungry, using the D.M.A. to revive the Kabutops and Aerodactyl, and initiates a citywide lockdown to prevent interference. Ash, Pikachu, and Latias evade the lockdown, racing to the museum while being pursued by the Kabutops and Aerodactyl.\n\nOakley tries to drown the trio, but Latias' psychic powers cause the D.M.A. to go out of control. Reaching the museum, the trio rescue Latios and shut down the machine. However, Annie tries to take the blackened Soul Dew, which shatters, causing all of the city's water to flow out and return as a tidal wave. Latias and Latios combine their powers to stop the wave, with Latios giving his life in the process. The Kabutops and Aerodactyl are returned to their fossilized states, while Annie and Oakley remain trapped in the D.M.A..\n\nAsh and friends find Latias, realizing Latios has died, but they share one last vision as he passes away. Several days later, Ash, Misty and Brock get ready to leave Alto Mare, saying goodbye to Lorenzo, but Bianca does not appear. On their way out of the city, they spot Bianca on the docks but she isn't wearing her hat (her hat is left back in her studio). Bianca gives Ash a sketch of him and Pikachu, kisses him on the cheek, and leaves without saying a word, Ash bids her goodbye and Brock and Misty are left wondering whether the girl was Bianca or Latias.\n\nAnnie and Oakley are soon saved by authorities and sent to prison, where they go through the possessions of [[Pok\u00e9mon The Movie 2000|Lawrence III]].\n\n== Japanese version ==\nThe Japanese version had a few key differences from the English version.\n* Annie and Oakley were not affiliated with Team Rocket.\n* The original Soul Dew may or may not have the soul of a Latios inside it at all. The one that appears after Latios' death still does.\n* Latios' Japanese voice was not retained in the dub, which opted to use Latias's voice clips instead.\n* The American version edited out the prologue where Annie and Oakley were reciting the legend of Alto Mare from the book they were about to steal. The prologue is as follows:\n\nA long time ago, Alto Mare was just a small town. One day, an old couple walking along the beach found two unconscious children lying in the sand. They brought the children home and took care of them. But a dark cloud above Alto Mare rained down shards of darkness. Anything these shards touched became dark as well. One shard was about to hit the old couple when the children started to glow and all the shards were destroyed. The  children revealed themselves as Latios and Latias. More appeared, one of them carrying the Soul Dew. Their power, combined with the Soul Dew's, shone upon the dark cloud, vanquishing it. In gratitude for their help, the two Latios and Latias gave the Soul Dew to the old couple.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Character !! Japanese voice !!
