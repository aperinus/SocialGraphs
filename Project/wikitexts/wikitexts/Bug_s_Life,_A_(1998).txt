It was the second feature-length film produced by Pixar. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from a [[protection racket]] run by Hopper's gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the \"warriors\" he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs.\n\nThe film was initially inspired by [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | title = A Bug's Life (1998) | last = Maslin | first = Janet | access-date = June 16, 2016 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302204943/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | department = Movies & TV Dept. | work = [[The New York Times]] | author-link = Janet Maslin | date = 2016 | archive-date = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Bug's Life \u2013 The Tale | url = https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | website = pixar.com | publisher = Pixar | access-date = July 24, 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053510/https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | archive-date = December 5, 2010}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and [[Joe Ranft]]. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between [[Steve Jobs]] and Lasseter of Pixar and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] due to the parallel production of his similar film ''[[Antz]]'', which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and grossed $363&nbsp;million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on [[DVD]], and has been released multiple times on home video.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words.

Please check wordcount carefully before adding anything. -->\nA colony of ants, led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta, lives in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as \"Ant Island\". Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of domineering grasshoppers, led by Hopper. One day, an inventor ant named Flik accidentally knocks the offering into the water with his latest invention, a grain harvester. Upon finding the food is gone, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off.\n\nAt the \"bug city\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik happens upon the aftermath of a chaotic bar fight and mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird, gaining the ants' respect. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being \"warriors\" so that the troupe may continue enjoying the ants' hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants' superior numbers, and suspects that the ants would eventually rebel if not kept in line.\n\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs' old boss P.T. Flea arrives in hopes of rehiring them, and Flik's deception is accidentally revealed. Outraged, the ants exile him and the Circus Bugs, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\n\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, unaware that the bird is a fake, exposes it as a decoy after he burns it. Hopper has Flik beaten in retaliation, proclaiming that the ants are lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper away. \n \nThe ants shove Hopper into P.T. Flea's circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik. Flik lures Hopper to the nest of the bird who attacked Dot earlier; thinking the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts the real bird, until the latter grabs him and feeds him to its three chicks.\n\nWith the grasshoppers gone, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the island. He and Atta become a couple, and they send a few ants and Hopper's friendly brother Molt to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess, respectively. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{anchor|Cast and characters|Cast}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Flik, a brave but accident-prone inventor ant wanting to make a difference.\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang oppressing the ants.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Princess Atta, the nervous queen-in-training of the ant colony and Flik's love interest.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Dot, Atta's younger sister and Flik's friend.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Francis, a hot-tempered male [[ladybug]] clown in the circus, who is frequently mistaken for a female.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Heimlich, a large, gluttonous [[caterpillar]] clown with a [[German accent]] in the circus who desires to be a [[butterfly]].\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Slim, a [[stick bug|walking stick]] clown often used as a stand-in for stick-like props in the circus.\n* [[Jonathan Harris]] as Manny, an elderly [[praying mantis]] magician with an [[English accent]] in the circus.\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Gypsy, a colorful  [[gypsy moth]] who is Manny's wife and assistant in the circus.\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Rosie, a [[black widow spider]] and Dim's \"tamer\" in the circus.\n* [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]] as Tuck and Roll, two twin<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Sterngold | first1 = James | title = At the Movies; Bug's Word: Yaddanyafoo | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/04/movies/at-the-movies-bug-s-word-yaddanyafoo.html | access-date = February 19, 2017 | work = The New York Times | date = December 4, 1998 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140129011310/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/04/movies/at-the-movies-bug-s-word-yaddanyafoo.html | archive-date = January 29, 2014 | url-status = live | quote = Tuck is older by a few milliseconds,... }}</ref> acrobat [[pillbug]] brothers from [[Hungary]] and act as cannonballs in the circus.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as [[P.T.

Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled ''Army Ants'', that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.<ref name=\"bw\">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | last1 = Burrows | first1 = Peter | title = ''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs'' | work = Business Week | date = November 23, 1998 | access-date = March 7, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991128083348/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | archive-date = November 28, 1999 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> During an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of ''Toy Story'' was in process.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/> In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">Price, p. 160</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/><ref name=\"inspiration\">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character Flik.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe voice cast was heavy with television [[sitcom]] stars of the time: Flik was voiced by [[Dave Foley]] (from ''[[NewsRadio]]''), Princess Atta was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (from ''[[Seinfeld]]''), Molt was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] (from ''[[Spin City]]''), Slim was voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]] (from ''[[Frasier]]'') and Dim was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] (from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[Joe Ranft]], member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/>\n\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the [[68th Academy Awards|1995 Academy Awards]] and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.<ref name=commentary/>\n\n''A Bug's Life'' was the final film appearance of actor [[Roddy McDowall]], who played Mr. Soil, before dying shortly before the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite web | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-25/features/9811250037_1_ant-colonies-bug-s-life-ant-hero | title = 'A Bug's Life | first = Michael | last = Wilmington | date = November 25, 1998 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | quote = The players\u2014whose colorful members include Madeline Kahn as Gypsy the moth, Michael McShane as the Hungarian pill bug brothers Tuck & Roll and, in his farewell appearance, Roddy McDowall as the grandfatherly Mr. Soil\u2014all help make \"Bug's Life\" special. | access-date = January 7, 2018 | archive-date = January 4, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104171415/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-25/features/9811250037_1_ant-colonies-bug-s-life-ant-hero | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Art design and animation===\nIt was more difficult for animators during the production of ''A Bug's Life'' than that of ''Toy Story'', as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/> Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/><ref name=\"behind the scenes\">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name=\"behind the scenes\"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 163</ref>\n\nThe animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]\u2014developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref>\n\n===Feud between Pixar and DreamWorks===\nDuring the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/307 307] | isbn = 978-1-4516-4853-9 }}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name=\"PixarTouch13\"/>\n\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\" for computer animation companies, he told various friends.<ref name=\"bw\"/> \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/>\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/308 308] | isbn = 978-1-4516-4853-9 }}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled ''Bugs'' to open the same week as ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/>\n\nKatzenberg moved the opening of ''Antz'' from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"ap\">{{cite news | url = http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | title = Of Ants, Bugs, and Rug Rats: The Story of Dueling Bug Movies | agency = Associated Press | date = October 2, 1998 | access-date = March 4, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172821/http://laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/october02/ants.htm | archive-date = March 3, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> David Price writes in his 2008 book ''The Pixar Touch'' that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have ''Antz'' ready first, despite Pixar's head start\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling.

If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put ''Antz'' on hold.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\">Price, p. 172</ref>\n\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a \"schlock version\" of ''A Bug's Life''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\"/> Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen ''Antz'', told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch13\">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Despite the successful box office performance of both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'', tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name=\"Isaacson309\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/309 309] | isbn = 978-1-4516-4853-9 }}</ref> Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name = A Bug's Life: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type = soundtrack\n| artist = [[Randy Newman]]\n| cover =\n| alt =\n| released = October 27, 1998\n| recorded = 1998\n| venue =\n| studio =\n| genre = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length = 47:32\n| label = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer =\n| chronology = [[Randy Newman]]\n| prev_title = [[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]\n| prev_year = 1996\n| next_title = [[Pleasantville (soundtrack)|Pleasantville]]\n| next_year = 1998\n| misc = {{Extra chronology\n | artist = [[Pixar]] soundtrack\n | type = film\n | prev_title = [[Toy Story (soundtrack)|Toy Story]]\n | prev_year = 1995\n | title = A Bug's Life\n | year = 1998\n | next_title = [[Toy Story 2 (soundtrack)|Toy Story 2]]\n | next_year = 1999\n}}\n}}\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]].
