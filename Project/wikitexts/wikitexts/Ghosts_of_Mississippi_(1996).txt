The plot is based on the true story of the 1994 trial of [[Byron De La Beckwith]], the white supremacist accused of the 1963 assassination of [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist [[Medgar Evers]].\n\n[[James Woods]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role of Byron De La Beckwith, but lost to [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1997 1997|Oscars.org]</ref> The original music score was composed by [[Marc Shaiman]] and the cinematography is by [[John Seale]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Medgar Evers]] was an African-American civil rights activist in [[Mississippi]] murdered on June 12, 1963. It was suspected that [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], was the murderer. He had been tried twice in the 1960s and both trials ended in [[hung jury|hung juries]].  Evers' widow [[Myrlie Evers]] had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years. In 1989, emboldened by a newspaper article by [[Jerry Mitchell (reporter)|Jerry Mitchell]] exposing [[jury tampering]] by the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] in the first two trials, Myrlie Evers believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, [[Bobby DeLaughter]], an assistant [[District Attorney]], decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter forms a team of investigators from his office, however investigation suffers many setbacks. After learning that several of the key witnesses have died, and the court transcript of their testimony from the 1960s trials is lost, the team is convinced this is a futile effort. This is re-inforced when DeLaughter fails at a desperate strategy of convincing two police officers who provided De La Beckwith with an [[alibi]] in the 1960s trials to admit they lied under oath. However, their pessimism fades with two discoveries.  The rifle used in the murder, thought to have been lost, was hiding in plain sight. Later, one of the investigators learns of the existence of a witness unknown to the prosecution in the 1960s trials, Delmar Dennis. Dennis was a former member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] who agreed to be an undercover informant for the [[FBI]]. Dennis testified against the Klan in the [[Mississippi Burning case]], and once mentioned having met De La Beckwith. The investigation  turns to finding Dennis, who was living in hiding since [[turning state's evidence]] on the KKK, to see what he knows of the case. Once confirming Dennis indeed had met De La Beckwith, the team is optimistic they have enough to secure a new indictment. As knowledge becomes public that the district attorney's office has re-opened the case, white supremacist elements threaten DeLaughter and his children, having by this time separated from his wife. After committing to Myrlie that he will try De La Beckwith again, Myrlie, initially skeptical of DeLaughter, reveals she has a court certified transcript of one of the 1960s trails in her possession. DeLaughter had long sought such a transcript to be able to read testimony from deceased witnesses to the jury for the new trial. DeLaughter mostly presents the same case as was presented in the 1960s trial, except using Dennis and two other witnesses to testify as substitutes for deceased witnesses, and having Detective Lloyd Bennett read the testimony of his father, Detective LC Bennett, the officer who found the murder weapon while searching the crime scene, to the jury.  In 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film ends with Myrlie tearfully rejoicing to the assembled crowd at the courthouse that she never gave up in the fight for justice for Medger.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Bobby DeLaughter]]\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as [[Myrlie Evers-Williams|Myrlie Evers]]\n* [[James Woods]] as [[Byron De La Beckwith]]\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Dixie DeLaughter\n* [[Susanna Thompson]] as Peggy Lloyd\n* [[Craig T.
