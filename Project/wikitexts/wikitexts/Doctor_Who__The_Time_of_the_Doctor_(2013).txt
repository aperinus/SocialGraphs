The episode also features [[Jenna Coleman]] as the Doctor's companion [[Clara Oswald]], plus several enemies of the Doctor, including the [[Dalek]]s, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]], [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Silence]] and [[Weeping Angel]]s.\n\nThe episode addresses numerous plot threads developed over the course of Smith's tenure, including the prophecy of the Silence, cracks in the universe, and the Doctor's fate on the planet Trenzalore, while also dealing with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] limit established in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]''. \"The Time of the Doctor\" is Smith's fourth and final Christmas special as the Eleventh Doctor.\n\n==Plot==\nThousands of aliens orbit the planet Trenzalore, from which a message is continually being broadcast across time and space. The Church of the Papal Mainframe constructs a force field around Trenzalore. The [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] are offered the opportunity to explore to find the source of the message on the planet by the church's head, Tasha Lem.\n\nThey discover the message is coming from a human settlement called Christmas. The message originates from a crack in reality in the clock tower and is being sent by the Doctor's people: the [[Time Lord]]s. The Doctor deduces the Time Lords are trying to escape the pocket universe they are in and want the Doctor to announce his name as a sign that it is safe to emerge. A stalemate is in place; the other aliens cannot attack at the risk of the Doctor letting the Time Lords out, while the Doctor cannot risk abandoning Trenzalore as most of the forces in orbit will burn it to stop the Time Lords' return.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (16584487375).jpg|thumb|200px|left|The drawings the older Doctor is surrounded by, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nThe Doctor tricks Clara into being returned to Earth. Clara jumps onto the [[TARDIS]] before it returns to the Doctor, arriving 300 years later. The Doctor reveals to her that his body has no further [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerations]] left, and that he is prepared to die defending Trenzalore. The two discover that in the intervening time, the Papal Mainframe have renamed themselves the [[Silence (Doctor Who)|Church of the Silence]], and that a chapter of the Silence broke off to try to interfere with the Doctor's life, which includes them unwittingly creating the crack in the tower. After rescuing Tasha Lem from the [[Dalek]]s, the Doctor tricks Clara again into being returned to Earth. As even more centuries pass, the Daleks remain the only aggressors against the Doctor and the dwindling forces of the Silence. Tasha eventually brings Clara back to Trenzalore as the siege finally comes to a conclusion. The Doctor is dying of old age and cannot stop the Daleks' attack. After saying goodbye to Clara, he goes out to the top of the tower to face his enemies.\n\n[[File:The time of the doctor regeneration energy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Eleventh Doctor]], about to die from old age, is granted a new regeneration cycle by the [[Time Lord]]s, subsequently preventing his death.]]\nClara speaks to the Time Lords through the crack, begging them to help the Doctor. The crack in the tower closes and reappears in the night sky. Regeneration energy flows from the crack and into the Doctor, granting him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor uses the excess energy of his regeneration to destroy the Daleks, while the crack closes, ending the stalemate. In the aftermath, the Doctor sets the TARDIS in motion, and finishes regenerating. The [[Twelfth Doctor]] finds the TARDIS is crashing while Clara looks on in confusion.\n\n== Production ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Matt Smith speaking at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International.jpg\n| width1 = 117\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Peter Capaldi by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = \"The Time of the Doctor\" is the last episode to feature Matt Smith (left) in the central role, and the second to include Peter Capaldi (right) as the new Doctor, following his cameo in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\".\n}}\nActor [[Matt Smith]] said filming would commence on the episode when he had finished work on the film ''[[Lost River (film)|Lost River]]''.

The other way is to watch it for the poetry, the resonances and the connections and a sense of wonder about life (extra-terrestrially dressed at times, but our life underneath).\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-doctor-who-review-20131227,0,605889.story#axzz2pP1EUErR |title=Review: 'Doctor Who's' Matt Smith exits with comic energy, grace |last=Lloyd |first=Robert |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=26 December 2013 |access-date=4 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nJon Cooper of ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' gave the episode a positive review, calling it \"Easily the highlight of Christmas telly,\" and that it \"gave Matt Smith a perfect send off.\" He awarded the episode 4 stars out of 5. He praised Smith, saying, \"Easily the best he's put in since his tenure began.\" He criticised the pacing, noting that \"viewers hoping for an all-out intergalactic bloodbath must've left feeling disappointed, hundreds of years of inter-species warfare were skipped over in the blink of an eye\". He also found the need for every single one of the Doctor's enemies to be there pointless, saying \"Daleks on their own would have more than sufficed.\" He also found similarities with [[David Tennant]]'s regeneration story \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", mainly the regeneration sequence, with the Doctor removing one piece of his costume before changing, and the now traditional callback to the previous regeneration with Capaldi's entrance with the kidneys line.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/doctor-who-verdict-matt-smith-2959430 |title=Doctor Who verdict: Matt Smith had a superb send off in The Time of the Doctor and it wasn't just prosthetics that made you believe the Doctor had aged |last=Cooper |first=Jon |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] |date=27 December 2013 |access-date=3 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nNeela Debnath of ''[[The Independent]]'' gave a positive review, saying that \"Smith gave a cracking final performance before bowing out.\" She said that the episode \"was a sci-fi spectacular!\" She also criticised the plot as being too complicated for its own good.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-christmas-special-tv-review-confused-by-the-new-doctorhe-certainly-seemed-to-be-9025336.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220620/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/doctor-who-christmas-special-tv-review-confused-by-the-new-doctorhe-certainly-seemed-to-be-9025336.html |archive-date=20 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Confused by Doctor Who?

He praised Jenna Coleman's performance, saying she is \"dependably excellent.\" But he did say \"'The Time of the Doctor' is a case of the parts being greater than the whole. It has great scenes and standout moments rather than being a great episode.\" He also criticised the pacing and \"a repetitive story structure robbing many key moments of their power.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a540266/doctor-who-matt-smiths-final-episode-digital-spy-review.html |title=Doctor Who: Matt Smith's final episode |last=Jeffery |first=Morgan |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=26 December 2013 |access-date=26 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAlasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' was overwhelmingly positive in his review, praising the subtle emotional complexities. \"This episode belongs to Matt Smith, and it's entirely likely that this will go down as his finest work in the role. Steven Moffat takes great care to spotlight every aspect of Smith's Doctor. He is alternately grumpy, funny, awkward, flirty, inquisitive, giddy, and heartbroken, and that simply covers the bits up to the reveal of the crack in reality. The old-age makeup isn't entirely convincing\u2014though I'm not honestly sure any old-age makeup has ever been entirely convincing\u2014but Smith nicely modulates his performance to suit the increasingly wizened versions of his Doctor.\" He praised the episode for being an effective \"final act\" rather than a standalone story. He gave the episode a rating of \"A\".<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite news |first=Alasdair |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/the-time-of-the-doctor-106556 |title=Doctor Who: \"The Time Of The Doctor\" |newspaper=[[The A.V.

I can\u2019t think of a better way for the Eleventh Doctor to end his tenure.\" He stated, \"There were lots of loose ends for writer Steven Moffat to tie up, but somehow he did it.\" Of the Doctor's protection of Trenzalore: \"It\u2019s this action that is the perfect farewell to the Eleventh Doctor. He\u2019s the Doctor, more than any other, who has run away and not wanted to be tied to any one place or time... compelled to stay put to save each and every life he can.\" The final scene \"[allowed] the Eleventh Doctor to go out with dignity and both appreciate the sadness of leaving without casting a pall over the new.\" He added, \"We get our first, very fleeting glimpse of the next Doctor, Peter Capaldi, who is just as intense and strange as we probably expected.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nerdist.com/2013/12/doctor-who-review-the-time-of-the-doctor-spoilers/ |title=DOCTOR WHO Review: The Time of the Doctor (SPOILERS!) |last=Anderson |first=Kyle |publisher=[[Nerdist News|Nerdist]] |date=25 December 2013 |access-date=4 January 2014 }}</ref>\n\nTim Martin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the episode three stars, criticising the complexity of the episode and the fact that loose plot holes were all left to be answered in just 60 minutes: \"Every time the Gordian plot-knot gets sonic-screwdrivered into submission for the 60-minute limit, the writers just tap the remnants into Later. What's the deal with the creepy brain-wiping creatures known as The Silence? Later. The name of the Doctor? Later, and then we get ''The Time of the Doctor'', where every second line seems to offer a footnote to some arcane [[Wikipedia]] entry on Whovian lore.\" Despite this, he praised Smith's final performance saying, \"the actor was so good as the childlike alien.\"<ref name=\"telegraph review\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10536070/Doctor-Who-The-Time-of-the-Doctor-BBC-One-review.html |title=Doctor Who, The Time of the Doctor, BBC One, review |last=Martin |first=Tim |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=25 December 2013 |access-date=26 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nPatrick Mulkern of ''[[Radio Times]]'' said he was \"really warming to the current companion, especially now she's free of the 'Impossible Girl' baggage. Perky, resourceful, best-friend material, Jenna Coleman's Clara has a tangible echo of [[Elisabeth Sladen|Lis Sladen]]'s [[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah]] about her.\" He noticed an ''End of Time'' callback, with the Doctor seeing his previous companions before his regeneration and, just as the Tenth Doctor had once destroyed the TARDIS with regeneration energy, the Eleventh doctor destroyed a Dalek ship with it. He looked forward to seeing Peter Capaldi take over with his \"Gaunt, lizard-like [face] and with frou-frou hair.
