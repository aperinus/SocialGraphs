Based on the novel ''Woe to Live On'', by [[Daniel Woodrell]], the film, set during the [[American Civil War]], follows a group of men who join the First [[Missouri]] Irregulars, also known as the [[Bushwhackers]]\u2014[[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] units loyal to pro-Confederacy units of the state\u2014and their war against Northern [[Jayhawker]]s allied with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army. [[Simon Baker]], [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]], [[Jonathan Brandis]], [[Jim Caviezel]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], and [[Celia Weston]] are featured in supporting performances.\n\nThe film was a [[Co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] between [[Universal Studios]] and [[Good Machine]]. [[Principal photography]] began on March 25, 1998. Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by the [[USA Films]] division of Universal, and premiered in only six theaters nationwide in the United States on November 26, 1999, and for only three days, grossing a total of $635,096. Taking into account its $38 million budget costs, the film was considered a major [[box office bomb]].\n\n''Ride with the Devil'' has been noted for its thematic exploration of politics, violence and war.<ref name=\"film\">[[Ang Lee]].

United States: [[Universal Pictures]].</ref> In 2010, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a restored [[High-definition video|high-definition digital transfer]] for the home media market, featuring an extended 148-minute director's cut of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nJake Roedel and Jack Bull Chiles are friends in [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] when the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] breaks out. Roedel is the American-assimilated son of a German immigrant who suffers from sporadic [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German suspicion]] from other Southerners (as the German population in the state was largely sympathetic to the Union) while Chiles is the son of planter Asa Chiles.\n\nOne night, Jake watches as Asa is executed by a band of [[Jayhawkers]]. Jack manages to escape, and he and Jake join the First Missouri Irregulars under \"Black\" John Ambrose, an informal unit loyal to the [[Confederate government of Missouri]]. Also fighting with Ambrose are George Clyde and Daniel Holt, who most assume is Clyde's slave; Jake learns that Clyde [[manumission|bought Holt his freedom]] after Holt, whom Clyde had known since childhood, helped him kill the Union soldiers who shot his father and brothers. However, Holt was separated from his mother, who was sold to a new master in [[Texas]].\n\nThe Irregulars use [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics against the Jayhawkers, supported by the pro-Confederate citizens of Missouri. During their travels, Jake is notified that his father was killed by Alf Bowden, a Unionist whose life Jake spared, in revenge for those slain by the Irregulars. With winter approaching, Ambrose sends Jake, Jack, Holt, and Clyde to hide on the property of the Evans family. A young widow in the household, Sue Lee Shelley, becomes romantically involved with Jack. With Clyde off to romance a female friend on a nearby farm and Chiles occupied with Sue Lee, a friendship begins between Jake and Holt.\n\nJack is severely wounded when the group goes after the Jayhawkers who killed the Evans patriarch. With Union soldiers in the area, a nervous Clyde abandons the group to rejoin the Irregulars. Jake, Holt, and Sue Lee try to [[amputation|amputate]] Jack's injured arm, but he dies from complications of [[gangrene]]. After burying him, Jake and Holt escort Shelley to the Brown family homestead and entrust her to them while they ride off to find Clyde. In the process, they learn that the Union army has managed to isolate and hunt down many of their former comrades.\n\nThe Irregulars join forces with the guerrillas led by [[William Quantrill]], who plans to [[Lawrence Massacre|raid Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name=\"film\"/> The pro-South forces easily overcome the small garrison of troops guarding Lawrence, burn and loot shops and homes, and kill Union supporters and black [[freedmen]]. A disgusted Jake and Holt walk into a cafe to eat breakfast. Pitt Mackeson, a sadistic guerrilla who despises Jake for being Ambrose's favorite, enters the establishment and threatens the owners before Jake and Holt force him to leave at gunpoint.\n\nAs the guerrillas make their escape, [[5th Kansas Cavalry Regiment|Union troops]] pursue them into the woods. Quantrill and Ambrose organize the men to feign retreat and form battle lines, enabling them to hold off the pursuit. Mackeson tries to shoot Jake from behind, and when Holt angrily tries to fire back, a bullet hits him in the side. Clyde rushes to his aid, only to get shot through the throat and die right in Holt's arms. Jake is able to pull Holt to safety, and the two men flee on horseback.\n\nReturning to the Brown family, they spend some time recuperating. With both Jack and Clyde gone, Jake and Holt reflect on their futures; Jake admits that he doesn't want to return to the Irregulars as he feels that the war is turning against the Confederacy, while Holt confides that although he was not Clyde's slave, he feels \"free\" now that his friend is gone. Shelley gives birth to Jack's daughter, Grace. The Browns, who assume Jake is the child's father, [[shotgun wedding|pressure him to marry]] Shelley, which he is reluctant to do. However, after spending time with Shelley and her child, Jake begins to have feelings for both of them.\n\nNews arrives that Quantrill has fled to [[Kentucky]] and Mackeson and the surviving Irregulars are now [[outlaw]]s who pillage both Unionists and defenseless Southerners for anything of value. Jake is warned that Mackeson intends to settle the business between them soon. Mr. Brown secretly invites a reverend into his home to marry Jake and Shelley, and they spend the night together. Jake shaves and cuts his hair, something he swore he would never do until the war was over, and prepares a wagon to take him and his new family to [[California]].\n\nWhile making camp, he and Holt run into Mackeson, who is on the run and increasingly suicidal after learning of both Quantrill and Ambrose's deaths. Mackeson declares that he will ride into the nearest Union-occupied town for drinks even though doing so would mean certain death; his unhinged manners lead Jake and Holt to draw their guns in self-defense. However, after drinking a cup of brewed [[chicory]] offered to him by Jake, Mackeson simply rides off.\n\nWith his service now complete, Holt tells Jake that he is heading to Texas in the hopes of finally freeing his mother from slavery. After the two friends shake hands and exchange farewells, Holt tips his hat to Jake and rides away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Jake Roedel\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Jack Bull Chiles\n* [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] as Sue Lee Shelley\n* [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Daniel Holt\n* [[Simon Baker]] as George Clyde\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Pitt Mackeson\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as Black John Ambrose\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as Riley Crawford\n* [[Jonathan Brandis]] as Cave Wyatt\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Alf Bowden\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Orton Brown\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Wilma Brown\n* [[John Ales]] as [[William Quantrill]]\n* [[Matthew Faber]] as Turner Rawls\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Mrs. Clark\n* John Judd as Otto Roedel\n* [[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]] as George\n* [[John Durbin]] as Skaggs\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Mr. Evans\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar Stephen Teo notes that the film approaches themes of \"domesticity, the role of women, [[homosociality]], and violence...&nbsp; with great sensitivity.\"{{sfn|Teo|2017|p=169}}\n\nMany critics have noted that the film does little to orient or guide its audience through the historical landscape in which it is set,{{sfn|Nelson|2013|pages=40\u201341}} and instead presents events in a manner that is \"unremarkable,\" \"undemonstrative,\" and \"somewhat ghostly.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2013|p=41}} Writer Andrew Patrick Nelson considers ''Ride with the Devil'' as being part of the [[revisionist Western]] tradition, though he concedes that it \"has little of the self-consciousness that generally marks the form.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2013|p=41}} Nelson asserts that director Ang Lee often forgoes excessive attention to historical details, and instead attempts to immerse the audience in an experience that \"is responsive to the daily realities and rhythms that surround the characters.\"{{sfn|Nelson|2013|p=41}} It is because of this that Nelson claims the film has more in common with \"[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]\" works of filmmakers such as [[Terrence Malick]].\"{{sfn|Nelson|2013|p=41}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting and set design===\nThe leading actors were required to go through three weeks of [[Recruit training|boot camp]] to prepare them for their roles.
