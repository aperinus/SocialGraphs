Parker, [[Jim Jennewein]], and [[Steven E. de Souza]] based on the [[The Flintstones|1960\u20131966 animated television series of the same name]]. The film stars [[John Goodman]] as [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as [[Betty Rubble]], along with [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as a villainous executive-vice president of Fred's company, [[Halle Berry]] as his seductive secretary, and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] (in her final theatrical film appearance), as [[Pearl Slaghoople]], Wilma's mother. [[The B-52's]] (as The BC-52's in the film) performed their version of the cartoon's theme song.\n\nThe film, shot in California, was theatrically released on May 27, 1994, and earned almost $342 million worldwide against a $46 million budget, making it a huge box office success, despite earning mixed reviews from critics. Audiences and fans praised its faithfulness to its source material, visual effects, costume design, art direction, and performances (particularly Goodman as Fred), but criticized the storyline, tone (which they deemed too mature for family audiences) and casting choices on O'Donnell and Taylor. A [[tie-in]] promotion with [[McDonald's]] was made to promote the film. The movie was originally acquired by [[New Line Cinema]], but then sold to [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nA prequel titled ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' was released in 2000.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Please refrain from adding unnecessary detail. -->\nIn prehistoric suburban [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], Slate & Co.'s new vice-president Cliff Vandercave and secretary Sharon Stone discuss their plan to swindle the company of its vast fortune, pin the theft on an employee, and flee. [[Fred Flintstone]] loans his best friend and neighbor [[Barney Rubble]] money so that he and his wife [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] can adopt a little boy named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], who can only pronounce his own name. Though initially hard to control because of his super strength, Bamm-Bamm eventually warms up to his new family and befriends Fred\u2019s daughter [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Despite his mother-in-law [[Pearl Slaghoople]]'s objections, Fred's wife [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma]] remains supportive of his decision to loan the Rubbles money.\n\nCliff holds an aptitude test with the worker with the highest mark becoming the company's new vice president. Barney gets the highest score but switches his paper with Fred, whom he knows will fail. Fred receives the promotion, complete with executive perks such as a luxurious office and Stone appointed as his secretary. To test Fred\u2019s willingness to follow orders, Cliff asks him to dismiss Barney who, with Fred's test paper, has the lowest score in the company. Though Fred is unwilling to fire him, Cliff warns him that he will fire both of them. Fred reluctantly accepts, but continues to help Barney support his family, even inviting the Rubbles to live with them so that they can rent out their house. However, Fred's job and newfound wealth eventually hinder his relationships with Wilma and the Rubbles. Cliff eventually tricks Fred into dismissing the other workers, over the objections of his office Dictabird. Later, Barney confronts Fred after seeing worker riots on the news and, after revealing that he switched tests with Fred, moves out with Betty. Wilma and Pebbles also leave for Pearl's house, leaving Fred behind.\n\nFred goes to the quarry, discovers Cliff's plan, and tries getting Mr. Slate to fire Cliff. However, having manipulated the events to make it look as if Fred stole the money, Cliff has reported the theft to the police. Fred flees, but a manhunt ensues by both the police and the fired workers. Wilma and Betty see this on the news and break into Slate & Co. to get the Dictabird, the only witness who can clear Fred's name, unaware that Cliff saw them from his office window. As a disguised Fred enters the workers' cave, he is discovered and the workers try hanging him. When Barney shows up as a sno-cone truck driver, the workers also try to hang him as well when he admits his role in the events. Fred and Barney reconcile before Wilma, Betty and the Dictabird save them and Wilma tells the workers that Fred was framed by Cliff.\n\nWhen the Flintstones and Rubbles return home, they find it burglarized with Dino and Pearl tied up and Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm gone. The group finds a note from Cliff saying that he will trade the children for the Dictabird. Fred and Barney confront Cliff at the quarry, where Cliff has tied Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm to a huge machine. Though they hand him the Dictabird, Cliff activates the machine to stall them. Barney rescues the children while Fred destroys the machine. The Dictabird escapes from Cliff and lures him back to the quarry, where Stone incapacitates him, having had a change of heart after learning of Cliff's plan to betray her. The police, Wilma, Betty, and Mr. Slate arrive and Cliff attempts to escape, but he is petrified by a substance falling from the machine.\n\nFred and the Dictabird tell the police of Cliff's actions and all charges against Fred are dropped. Impressed with the substance that Fred inadvertently created by destroying the machine, Mr. Slate dubs the substance \"concrete\" in honor of his daughter Concretia and declares the stone age over. Mr. Slate asks for the workers to be rehired and makes plans to produce the concrete with Fred leading its division. Having experienced the negatives of wealth and status, Fred declines the offer and asks that the workers be given two weeks paid leave as part of their salary, preferring to return to his old life. In a homage to the original series, at the end the Flintstones drive home from watching the movie; Fred tries to eat a restaurant order of \"ribs\" which literally turns the car over on its side; at home Fred tries to put the cat out but ends up locked outside; he screams for Wilma to let him back in.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[Fred Flintstone]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Barney Rubble]]\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as [[Wilma Flintstone]]\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as [[Betty Rubble]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Cliff Vandercave\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Miss Sharon Stone\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as [[The Flintstones#Relatives of the Flintstones|Pearl Slaghoople]]\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] (archive audio)\n* Elaine and Melanie Silver as [[Pebbles Flintstone]]\n* Hlynur and Marin\u00f3 Sigur\u00f0sson as [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]\n**  [[Elizabeth Daily]] supplied Bamm-Bamm's voice (dubbed and uncredited)\n* [[Dann Florek]] as Mr. Slate\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Hoagie\n* [[Irwin Keyes]] as Joe Rockhead\n* [[Jim Doughan]] as Maitre d'\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as the voice of Dictabird: Korman was the voice of [[The Great Gazoo]] from the original animated series.\n* [[Jonathan Winters]] as Grizzled Man, a co-worker of Fred and Barney's\n* [[Jack O'Halloran]] as Yeti\n* [[The B-52's]] as The BC-52's\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] as Mrs. Feldspar: Vander Pyl was the voice of Wilma in the original animated series\n* [[Laraine Newman]] as Susan Rock\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] as Mrs. Pyrite\n* [[Jay Leno]] as host of ''Bedrock's Most Wanted''\n* [[William Hanna]] as a boardroom executive\n* [[Joseph Barbera]] as a man driving a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mersandes]]\n* [[Sam Raimi]] as Cliff Vandercave look-alike\n* [[Alan Blumenfeld]] as Fred Flintstone look-alike\n* Messiri Freeman as Miss Stone look-alike\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nIn 1985, producers Keith Barish and [[Joel Silver]] bought the rights for a live-action feature film version of ''The Flintstones'' and commissioned [[Steven E. de Souza]] to write a script with [[Richard Donner]] hired to direct. De Souza's script submitted in September 1987 was eventually rejected and in October 1989 a new script by Daniel and Joshua Goldin was submitted.<ref name=scribe/> Peter Martin Wortmann and Robert Conte submitted another draft in March 1990 before [[Mitch Markowitz]] was hired to write a script.<ref name=scribe/> Said to be a cross of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', Markowitz commented that \"I don't even remember it that well, but Fred and Barney leave their town during a terrible depression and go across the country, or whatever that damn prehistoric thing is, looking for jobs. They wind up in trailer parks trying to keep their families together. They exhibit moments of heroism and poignancy\". Markowitz's version was apparently too sentimental for director Donner, who disliked it.<ref>{{cite news |title= A look inside Hollywood and the movies: 'YABBA DABBA WHO?': Hey!

Eventually, the rights were bought by Amblin Entertainment and [[Steven Spielberg]] who, after working with Goodman on ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', was determined to cast him in the lead as Fred. Brian Levant was hired as director, knowing he was the right person because of his love for the original series. They knew he was an avid fan of the series because of his Flintstones items collection and the knowledge he had from the series.\n\nWhen Levant was hired, all previous scripts were thrown out. In May 1992, [[Michael J. Wilson]] submitted a four-page story that became the basis for the film. This was turned into a script by [[Jim Jennewein]] and Tom S. Parker. A meeting of Levant, [[Bruce Cohen]], Jason Hoffs and Kate Barker gave notes to [[Gary Ross]], who produced another draft.<ref name=scribe/> Levant then recruited what he called an \"all-star writing team\" which consisted of his writer friends from television shows such as ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'', and ''[[Happy Days]]''. Levant described as \"a sitcom on steroids, just trying to improve it\". The writers, dubbed the Flintstone Eight, were Al Aidekman, Cindy Begel, Lloyd Garver, David Silverman, Stephen Sustarsic, [[Nancy Steen]], Neil Thompson plus Levant. The group wrote a new draft but four more round table sessions ensued, each of which was attended by new talent, including [[Rob Dames]], Lenny Ripps, Fred Fox Jr., [[Dava Savel]], Lon Diamond, [[David Richardson (writer)|David Richardson]], Roy Teicher, Richard Gurman, Michael J.
