Regarded as a [[sleeper hit]], ''Slumdog Millionaire'' was widely acclaimed, being praised for its plot, soundtrack, cinematography, editing, direction, and performances (especially Patel's). It was nominated for ten [[81st Academy Awards|Academy Awards in 2009]] and won eight\u2014the most for any 2008 film\u2014including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It won seven [[62nd British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], five [[14th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]] and four [[66th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]]. However, [[Reactions from India and the Indian diaspora to Slumdog Millionaire|reception in India and among Indian diaspora]] was mixed, and the [[Controversial issues surrounding Slumdog Millionaire|film was the subject of controversy]] over its depiction of [[poverty in India]] and other issues.\n\n== Plot ==\nEighteen-year-old Jamal Malik, an [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] from the [[Juhu]] slum of [[Mumbai]], is a contestant on ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'', and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the {{INR|20 million|link=yes}} question, he is detained and tortured by the [[Mumbai Police|police]], who suspect him of cheating. Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Jamal recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each answer.\n\nAt five years old, Jamal manages to obtain the autograph of [[Bollywood]] star [[Amitabh Bachchan]] after jumping into a [[cesspit]]. Jamal's elder brother Salim later sells the autograph. Their mother is killed during the [[Bombay riots]], and as the brothers flee the riot, they meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be their \"third musketeer\", a reference to the [[Alexandre Dumas]] novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' which the two brothers had learned about in school. The brothers refer to themselves as [[Athos (character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]] but do not know the third musketeer's name.\n\nThe three children are found by Maman{{mdash}}a [[Organised crime in India|gangster]] who [[Child trafficking in India|trains street children]] to become beggars. When Salim learns that Maman is blinding the children to make them more effective beggars - \"blind singers earn double\" - he escapes with Jamal and Latika to a train. The brothers successfully board the moving train but Latika is unable to keep up. Salim grabs her hand but purposefully lets go, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next few years, Salim and Jamal travel around on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, [[Pickpocketing|picking pockets]], washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the [[Taj Mahal]]. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, where they discover that she is being raised by Maman to be a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. The brothers rescue her, Salim shooting Maman dead. Salim gets a job with Javed{{mdash}}a rival crime lord. In their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika, presumably to sexually assault her. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him and Latika persuades Jamal to leave.\n\nYears later, Jamal, now working as a ''[[chaiwala]]'' in a [[Call center industry in India|call centre]], searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation and confronts him, Salim pleads for forgiveness and Jamal lies his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget about her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises that he will wait for her every day at five o'clock at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus|Victoria Terminus]]. Latika attempts to meet him there but she is captured by Javed's men, led by Salim. They  cut and scar her face as they drive away. Jamal loses contact with Latika and in a final attempt to reach her, he decides to become a contestant on ''Kaun Banega Crorepati'', because he knows she watches the show.\n\nJamal is extremely successful on the show and becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show's host, Prem Kumar. Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question. However, Jamal uses his [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?#Lifelines|50/50 lifeline]] and answers correctly, raising suspicion that he is cheating.\n\nWhen the episode ends, Jamal is arrested. After an initial [[Battery (crime)|beating]], the police inspector listens to his explanation of how he knew each answer. Finding his stories \"bizarrely plausible\", and that he admits that Jamal is \"too truthful\" to be a liar, the officer allows him to return to the show. Latika sees Jamal on the news. In an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, Salim gives Latika his phone and car keys, asking her to forgive him and to keep the phone near. After Latika leaves, Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed to realise Latika is free.\n\nFor the final question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. He laughs at the irony and admits he does not know but chooses to try to answer the question anyway. He uses his \"Phone-A-Friend\" lifeline to call Salim, because it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, but that she does not know the answer. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door but Salim kills Javed before he is shot and killed by the gang. Relieved about Latika, Jamal guesses and picks the first answer, [[Aramis]]. He is correct and wins the grand prize. Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station and kiss. Closing credits include an Indian film-style musical number, \"[[Jai Ho (song)|Jai Ho]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dev Patel]] as Jamal Malik, a boy born and raised in the poverty of [[Bombay]]/[[Mumbai]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |title=Slumdog Millionaire: The Film File: The New Yorker |first1=Anthony |last1=Lane |author-link=Anthony Lane |date=1 December 2008 |magazine=The New Yorker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217071203/https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/slumdog_millionaire_boyle |archive-date=17 December 2008 |access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> Boyle considered hundreds of young male actors, and he found that [[Indian film]] leads were generally \"strong, handsome hero-types\".

The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: \"I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums. What you pick up on is this mass of energy.\"\n\nBy the summer of 2006, British production companies [[Celador Films]] and [[Film4 Productions]] invited director [[Danny Boyle]] to read the script of ''Slumdog Millionaire''.

The film was projected to cost $15 million, so Celador sought a US [[film distributor]] to share costs. [[Warner Independent Pictures]] gave $5 million and got the rights to the film.<ref name=\"rags\" />\n\nGail Stevens came on board to oversee casting globally. Stevens had worked with Boyle throughout his career and was well known for discovering new talent. Meredith Tucker was appointed to cast out of the US. The film-makers then travelled to [[Mumbai]] in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in [[Karjat]]. Originally appointed as one of the five casting directors in India, [[Loveleen Tandan]] has stated, \"I suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of ''Slumdog'', that it was important to do some of it in [[Hindi]] to bring the film alive [...] They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do.

Mitu Sengupta (2009 and 2010) raises substantial doubts about both the realism of the film's portrayal of urban [[poverty in India]] and whether the film will assist those arguing for the poor. Rather, Sengupta argues the film's \"reductive view\" of such slums is likely to reinforce negative attitudes to those who live there. The film is therefore likely to support policies that have tended to further dispossess the slum dwellers in terms of material goods, power and dignity. The film, it is also suggested, celebrates characters and places that might be seen as symbolic of Western culture and models of development.<ref name=\"pmid20607903\">{{cite journal |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |title=A million dollar exit from the anarchic slum-world: Slumdog Millionaire's hollow idioms of social justice |journal=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=599\u2013616 |date=2010 |pmid=20607903 |doi=10.1080/01436591003701117 |s2cid=7455097 }}</ref><ref name=\"Frontline-20090327\">{{Cite magazine |last1=Sengupta |first1=Mitu |date=27 March 2009 |title=Hollow message |magazine=Frontline |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=14\u201327 |url-access=subscription |url=https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/article30186255.ece }}</ref> Ana Cristina Mendes (2010) places Boyle's film in the context of the aestheticising and showcasing of poverty in India for artistic (and commercial) purposes, and proceeds to examine \"the modes of circulation of these representations in the field of cultural production, as well as their role in enhancing the processes of ever-increasing consumption of India-related images.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|date=July 2010|title=Showcasing India Unshining: Film Tourism in Danny Boyle'sSlumdog Millionaire|journal=Third Text|volume=24|issue=4|pages=471\u2013479|doi=10.1080/09528822.2010.491379|s2cid=145021606|issn=0952-8822}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are others who point to the changing urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set. The film is seen by D. Parthasarathy (2009) as reflecting a larger context of global cultural flows, which implicates issues of labour, status, ascription-achievement, and poverty in urban India. Parthasarathy (2009) argues for a better understanding of issues of [[dignity of labour]] and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and India's new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathy|first=D.|date=30 September 2009|title=Of Slumdogs, Doxosophers, and the (In)Dignity of Labour(ers)|journal=SSRN|pages=14|ssrn=2096954}}</ref>\n\nAcademic criticism has also been extended to the underlying philosophy of the film, with its apparent [[Ends justify means|ends-justify-means]] message.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/movie-reviews-thursday-theater-slumdog-millionaire-danny-boyle/|title=All's Unwell that Only Ends Well: The Inconsistent Meaning of Life in ''Slumdog Millionaire''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=17 September 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=16 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217194649/http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/movie-reviews-thursday-theater-slumdog-millionaire-danny-boyle|archive-date=17 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Many elements of the film, including the apparent redemption of Salim at the end of his life and the film's subjugation of the suffering of peripheral characters to the romantic aspirations of Jamal, are characteristic, say such critics, of a na\u00efve, [[Divine providence|Providence]]-based vision of reality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Main|Slumdog Millionaire: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe ''Slumdog Millionaire'' soundtrack was composed by [[A.
