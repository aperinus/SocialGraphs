The film won the 1995 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs the film opens, Henri's father, a chauffeur also named Henri, is falsely accused of having murdered his boss. During his trial and imprisonment, Henri's mother finds a job in a tavern on a Normandy beach. There Henri sees a film adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''. His father dies attempting to escape from prison, and upon hearing the news Henri's mother commits suicide. Henri grows up an orphan and learns boxing.\n\nThe film next takes up the story of Elisa, a ballerina, and Andr\u00e9 Ziman, a young Jewish journalist and law student. They meet following a performance of a ballet based on ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''. Later, during World War II, Andr\u00e9 and Elisa, now married, and their daughter Salom\u00e9 attempt to cross the Swiss border to escape the Nazis. They encounter Henri, who owns a moving company, and they discuss the Hugo novel. The Zimans entrust Salom\u00e9 to Henri and enroll her in a Catholic convent school. Andr\u00e9 and Elisa are ambushed while trying to cross the frontier. Elisa is arrested and Andr\u00e9 wounded. Farmers who find him give him shelter.\n\nThe members of a local gang and Henri join the French Resistance, but the gang members take advantage of their anti-Nazi attacks to steal from local houses. Elisa and other women are forced to entertain the Nazi occupiers. She is sent to a concentration camp for being defiant. After staging an attack on a train transporting funds for the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], Henri and his mates travel to Normandy to visit the tavern where he lived as a child. The [[D-Day]] invasion is launched the next day and Henri supports the Allied forces when they conquer the beach. In the process he saves the life of the tavern owner's son Marius.\n\nAt the war's end, Henri accepts an offer to run a seaside camp in Normandy. There he receives a letter from Salom\u00e9, who has no way of contacting her family. He takes her with him to the resort, which he names Chez Jean Valjean. Elisa, having survived a Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, joins them later.\n\nA former Vichy police agent accuses Henri of abetting the gang's activities during the war and of robbing and burning a train. He is imprisoned to await trial. Meanwhile Andr\u00e9's one-time rescuer is holding him captive, hoping to live off his bank account. The farmer has told Andr\u00e9 that the American D-Day invasion failed and the Nazis now rule the world. With evident reluctance, the farmer's wife supports her husband in these lies until he attempts to poison Andr\u00e9. Then she shoots her husband before he can feed Andr\u00e9 the poisoned soup. As she checks to see if her husband is dead, he grabs her and chokes her to death. Andr\u00e9 escapes from his cellar prison on a bad leg and emerges to find the farmer couple dead and a liberated Europe. He rejoins his wife and daughter at Chez Jean Valjean and then represents Henri at his trial and wins his acquittal.\n\nAs the film ends, Henri, now the mayor, presides at the civil marriage of Salom\u00e9 and Marius in the presence of Andr\u00e9 and Elisa and the mother superior of the school that sheltered Salom\u00e9. Andr\u00e9 Ziman quotes Victor Hugo: \"The best of our lives is yet to come.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Leopold/Henri Fortin/Henri's father (also named Henri Fortin)\n* [[Michel Boujenah]] as Andr\u00e9 Ziman\n* [[Alessandra Martines]] as Elisa Ziman\n* [[:fr:Salom\u00e9 Lelouch|Salom\u00e9 Lelouch]] as Salom\u00e9 Ziman, child\n* [[:fr:Margot Abascal|Margot Abascal]] as Salom\u00e9 Ziman, adult\n* [[Annie Girardot]] as Madame Th\u00e9nardier\n* [[Philippe L\u00e9otard]] as Th\u00e9nardier\n* [[Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9]] as Catherine\n* [[Philippe Khorsand]] as Policeman\n* [[Ticky Holgado]] as Nice Street Urchin\n* [[William Leymergie]] as Toureiffel\n* [[Jean Marais]] as Msgr.
