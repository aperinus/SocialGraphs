The film serves as a [[prequel]] to ''[[The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and is the fourth installment in [[The Exorcist (film series)|''The Exorcist'' series]]. It stars [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Izabella Scorupco]], and [[James D'Arcy]].\n\n''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was retooled from [[Paul Schrader]]'s already completed ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]'', which [[Morgan Creek Productions]] executives feared would be unsuccessful. The film was released in the United States on August 20, 2004, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\nReviews for ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' were overwhelmingly negative, and it was a financial failure. Schrader was subsequently allowed to release his version, ''Dominion'', which was somewhat better reviewed than Renny Harlin's film but still earned mostly negative reviews.<ref>[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist#Reception]]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Cairo, Egypt]] in 1949, a young Father Lankester Merrin struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted by an incident in a small village in the [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupied Netherlands]] during [[World War II]], where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forced Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.\n\nMerrin is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who invites him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati in the [[Turkana region]] of [[Kenya Colony|British Kenya]]. The dig excavates a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-era [[Church (building)|church]] built circa 500 A.D. \u2014 long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Semelier asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon, thought to be in the church, before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis.\n\nUpon arriving at the site with their translator and guide Chuma, Merrin meets the chief excavator, a brutish man named Jefferies with visible [[boil]]s on his face and Sarah Novak, a doctor. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribesmen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.\n\nMerrin, Chuma, and Francis visit the dig site and finds only the [[dome]] uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction was completed. The three enter the church through the dome and find the place in near-pristine condition, but note two disturbing oddities; the statues of the angels holding weapons point their spears downward instead of triumphantly toward heaven. and that someone has vandalized and desecrated the church placing Christ on the cross in an upside-down position. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church.\n\nDetermined to learn more about the archaeological dig, Merrin asks to consult with the lead archaeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in [[Nairobi]]. Merrin visits Bession's tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin visits Bession, but when he enters his room, he discovers Bession has carved a [[Hooked Cross]] on his chest and is speaking in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. Bession then slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free\". Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.\n\nUpon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by [[hyena]]s that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother get ripped to pieces. The local chief's wife gives birth to a stillborn baby who is covered in [[maggot]]s and Jefferies, a man involved with the dig, gets attacked in the bar. Around the same time, Merrin discovers a passageway leading to a cave underneath the church that houses an ancient pagan temple with the statue of the demon Pazuzu. He also finds evidence that this temple was used to conduct human sacrifices. Upon his return, he sees the local tribe cremate the stillborn baby. This makes Merrin suspicious, because there are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village in the valley 50 years earlier. He had been told that the dead were buried in a graveyard just outside the valley. When he digs up the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, they are empty.\n\nMerrin confronts Father Francis about it, and Francis reveals to him the history of the Derati valley; a [[Byzantine army|great army]] led by two priests came to the valley searching for the origin of evil 1,500 years prior. When they arrived in the valley, the evil presence consumed them and one killed the other. When the lone surviving priest made it back, [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] ordered a church be built over the site, and then buried to seal the evil force inside of it. The builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded and found in 1893. Four priests subsequently came to Derati and enlisted the local tribe to help them. All of the tribesmen and the priests disappeared. The Vatican then ordered that the false graveyard be built and stories of a plague spread around to keep people away from the valley. Francis reveals that it is believed that the valley in Derati was the traditional spot of [[Lucifer]]'s fall after the war in heaven. Later Merrin, Chuma and Major Granville discover Jefferies tied up in the Church, with his organs pecked out by crows.\n\nThe dig's doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and she kills Francis. Merrin has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but she dies. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and [[Historic recurrence|history has repeated itself]]. Only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Sometime later Merrin once again a priest returns to [[Rome]] and meets with Semelier at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, Semelier replies: \"But you found something....Didn't you?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Father Lankester Merrin]]\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Sarah Novak\n* [[James D'Arcy]] as Father Francis\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Sergeant Major\n* [[Julian Wadham]] as Major Granville\n* Andrew French as Chuma\n* [[Ben Cross]] as Semelier\n* Remy Sweeney as Joseph\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Father Gionetti\n* [[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]] as Jefferies\n* [[Antonie Kamerling]] as Lieutenant Kessel\n* Eddie Osei as Emekwi\n* [[Israel Aduramo]] as Jomo\n* [[Patrick O'Kane]] as Bession\n* James Bellamy as James\n* [[Rupert Degas]] as [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nProducer James G.
