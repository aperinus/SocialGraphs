Directed by [[Jocelyn Moorhouse]], the film features [[Winona Ryder]], [[Anne Bancroft]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Kate Nelligan]] and [[Alfre Woodard]]. It also marked [[Jared Leto]]'s film debut. [[Amblin Entertainment]] optioned Otto's novel in 1991, and were able to persuade [[Steven Spielberg]] to finance the screenplay's development. ''How to Make an American Quilt'' garnered mixed reviews from critics. It was a box-office success, grossing $41 million against a $10 million budget. The film received a nomination for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Finn Dodd ===\nMain character. Following her boyfriend Sam's proposal, Finn visits her great aunt and grandmother to finish her thesis and think over it. At her grandmother's, a [[quilting]] group congregates, and she's shocked and surprised to discover that the current quilt that they're working on is a wedding gift for her when she gets married. The theme of the quilt is \"where love resides\". As Finn is unsure whether she's ready for marriage or if he's \"the one\", the women's stories in the quilting group open her eyes to the different kinds of love that exist.\n\nDuring her time at her grandmother's, she meets Leon at the local pool and they have a brief affair. Eventually, wrapped in her quilt and following a crow (reminiscent of Anna's tale about her aunt), she comes across Sam and chooses to stay with him.\n\n=== Sophia Darling ===\nIn her early 20s, Sophia was a talented [[Diving (sport)|diver]] with dreams of escaping her small town and overbearing mother. One day she meets Preston Richards while diving at the local pool and romance ensues. He's attracted by her fearlessness and she believes he can take her away from her current, oppressive way of life. However, motherhood turns out to be just as, if not more, oppressive and married life soon grinds her down. With three children and little help from Preston who is frequently away because of his job, she no longer has time to dive and eventually forgets the feeling of freedom and escape it gives her.\n\nOne day she snaps at Preston for digging a pond in the back garden. Trying to remind her of the girl he fell in love with, he tells her the pond is for her to wade in. After she rejects his efforts, he realizes her free spirit is gone. One morning, he leaves for work, never to return. Abandoned, bitter, and trapped in a life she didn't want, Sophia ends up like her overbearing mother, particularly in her relationship with Finn.\n\nYears later, when the wind blows part of Finn's thesis into the pond, she wades in to get it. With her feet in the pool, she remembers what her husband tried to remind her of all those years ago, and one of the last scenes shows her diving off the high dive.\n\n=== Em Reed ===\nEm marries young, like most of the women in the story. Despite the promiscuity of her artistic husband Dean, she stays with him for a period of time. Eventually, after discovering yet another affair, she leaves him whilst pregnant. She returns to her parents' home, but it still takes three months before Dean comes to find her. He begs forgiveness yet again, and her parents pack her bags, loading them into Dean's car. At this point, Em has no choice but to return to her broken life.\n\nYears later, she suspects Constance is having an affair with Dean, which causes friction between them. Later, she realizes that, in his own way, Dean does truly love her when she takes shelter in his studio during a sudden wind storm and discovers numerous paintings of her telling the story of their life together over the years.\n\n=== Glady Joe Cleary and Hy Dodd ===\nGladiola (Glady) Joe and Hyacinth (Hy) are Finn's great aunt and grandmother and sisters to one another. At one point, Hy goes to visit her dying husband in the hospital.  Despite her deep love for her husband, she leaves the hospital and sleeps with Glady's husband Arthur in a moment of weakness and tragic emotion.\n\nAfter Glady discovers the truth, she smashes every one of her porcelain figurines and plasters them onto the wall of the laundry room as a reminder of her anger. She never really forgives Arthur and does not forgive Hy until the end of the movie. Their reconciliation is symbolized by the demolition of the plastered walls in the laundry room when Glady realizes that her love for her sister surpasses her feelings of betrayal.\n\n=== Constance Saunders ===\nConstance had a happy and fulfilling marriage until her husband Howell died, leaving her a young widow. While he was alive, he gave Constance a dog to keep her company. Although it is rumored that she is having an affair with Dean, she knows that her love for her husband and her dog are her true companions. Her panel for Finn's wedding quilt depicts a yellow rose bush under which she and Howell buried the dog after it died.\n\n=== Anna Neale ===\nAs a young maid, Anna starts an affair with her boss's son Beck, who's visiting from Chicago. She becomes pregnant by him, and when her great aunt Pauline finds out about it she sends Anna away with their family story quilt (which she had sold to the boss's wife). During her pregnancy, Anna met Glady and Hy as she was taken in by their family.\n\nAnna becomes particularly close with Glady, eventually teaching her to quilt. During one of these quilting lessons, she starts labor, eventually giving birth to Marianna. It's only then that Anna realizes that her fancy notion of romantic love was nothing in comparison to the maternal love she feels for Marianna. Anna now orchestrates the quilting group.\n\n=== Marianna Neale ===\nMarianna gives the appearance of being in love with her promiscuous freedom until a moment of vulnerability comes in a conversation with Finn. She speaks of a man that she met in France. They had met and spent one evening together during which they connected over a meeting of minds before she discovered that he was married. Although she has taken many lovers since, she realizes this man is her soulmate and she doesn't even know his name.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Finn Dodd\n** Kaelynn and Sara Craddick as young Finn Dodd\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Glady Joe Cleary\n** [[Claire Danes]] as young Glady Joe Cleary\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Hy Dodd\n** [[Lecy Goranson]] as young Hy Dodd\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Sophia Darling Richards\n** [[Samantha Mathis]] as young Sophia Darling\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Em Reed\n** [[Joanna Going]] as young Em Reed\n* [[Kate Nelligan]] as Constance Saunders\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Marianna Neale\n* [[Maya Angelou]] as Anna Neale\n** Mar\u00eda Celedonio as young Anna Neale\n* [[Kate Capshaw]] as Sally Dodd\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Preston Richards\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Sam\n* [[Derrick O'Connor]] as Dean Reed\n** [[Tim Guinee]] as young Dean Reed\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Arthur Cleary\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Winston\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Beck\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as Mr. Dodd\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Leon\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Howell Saunders\n* [[Denis Arndt]] as James\n* Paige and Ryanne Kettner as Little Evie/Little Duff\n* [[Tamala Jones]] as Anna's Great Grandmother\n* [[Esther Rolle]] as Aunt Pauline\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Amblin Entertainment]] optioned [[Whitney Otto]]'s bestselling novel after it was released in 1991.
