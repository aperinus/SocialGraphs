The lame Marius is a security guard at an abandoned cement works, and since the company has gone out of business and the plant will soon be demolished, he is squatting in order to save money. Jeannette is a single mother raising her two children on her own on a meagre supermarket checkout operator salary. They meet when Jeannette tries to steal two cans of paint from the cement lot, and Marius catches her and tries to chase her. The following day Marius comes to her door to apologize and brings her the two cans of paint. A relationship soon develops between them, but as both have been wounded by marital difficulties and life in general, they are hesitant to become committed. It does not help that Jeannette's romantic fantasy notions are different from Marius' practical ideas. The two must learn how to love again in order for their relationship to blossom.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ariane Ascaride]] as Jeannette\n* [[G\u00e9rard Meylan]] as Marius\n* [[Pascale Roberts]] as Caroline\n* [[Jacques Boudet]] as Justin\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Bonnal]] as Monique\n* [[Jean-Pierre Darroussin]] as D\u00e9d\u00e9\n* [[Laetitia Pesenti]] as Magali, Jeannette's Daughter\n* [[Miloud Nacer]] as Malek, Jeannette's son\n* [[Pierre Banderet]] as Monsieur Ebrard\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* '''[[Butaca Awards]]''' (Spain)\n** Nominated: Best Art House Film\n* '''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n** '''Won''': [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress|Best Actress &ndash; Leading Role]] (Ariane Ascaride)\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Robert Gu\u00e9diguian)\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor &ndash; Supporting Role]] (Jean-Pierre Darroussin)\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress &ndash; Supporting Role]] (Pascale Roberts)\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] (Robert Gu\u00e9diguian and Jean-Louis Milesi)\n** Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress|Most Promising Actress]] (Laetitia Pesenti)\n* '''[[Goya Awards]]''' (Spain)\n** Nominated: [[Goya Award for Best European Film|Best European Film]]\n* '''[[Lumi\u00e8res Award]]''' (France)\n** '''Won''': [[Lumi\u00e8res Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n* '''[[Sant Jordi Awards]]''' (Spain)\n** '''Won''': Best Foreign Actress (Ariane Ascaride)\n* '''Won''': [[Louis Delluc Prize]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb title|0119620}}\n* {{Amg movie|154981|Marius and Jeannette}}\n\n{{Robert Gu\u00e9diguian}}\n{{Lumi\u00e8res Award for Best Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marius And Jeannette}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actress C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian]]\n[[Category:Films set in Marseille]]\n[[Category:Best Film Lumi\u00e8res Award winners]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]"}]}}}}
