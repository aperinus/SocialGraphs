He also wrote the [[screenplay]], based on a story he co-wrote with [[Jonathan Katz]]. The film's cast includes [[Lindsay Crouse]], [[Joe Mantegna]], [[Ricky Jay]], and [[J. T. Walsh]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Psychiatrist]] Margaret Ford has achieved success with her recently published book about [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], but feels unfulfilled. Her patient, Billy Hahn, says his life is in danger because he owes money to a criminal figure named Mike Mancuso. He threatens suicide, brandishing a gun. Margaret persuades him to surrender the weapon to her and promises to help him.\n\nThat night, Margaret visits a [[pool hall]] called House of Games where she confronts Mike. He is willing to forgive Billy's debt if Margaret accompanies him to a back-room [[poker]] game and identifies the [[tell (poker)|tell]] of George, another player. She agrees, and notices George plays with his ring when he [[Bluff (poker)|bluffs]]. She discloses this to Mike, who calls the bet. However, George wins and demands that Mike pay the $6,000 bet, which he is unable to do. George pulls a gun, but Margaret intervenes and offers to pay the debt with a [[Cheque|personal check]]. She then notices the gun is a [[Water gun|water pistol]], and realizes the entire game is a [[Confidence trick|set-up]] for her money. She declines to pay, but spends the rest of the night socializing with the con men. The experience excites her and she returns the next night. She asks Mike to teach her about con games so she can write a book about it. Mike appears skeptical, but agrees.\n\nMargaret is enchanted by Mike showing her simple con tricks. Eventually, the two sneak into a hotel room and have sex. Afterward, Mike tells Margaret that con artists take a small token from every \"mark\" to signify their dominance. While Mike is in the bathroom, she takes a small pocket knife belonging to the room's occupant. Mike says he is late for another large-scale con that he and his associates are planning at the same hotel. Mike reluctantly allows her to tag along, posing as his wife. The con involves Mike, his partner Joey, and the \"mark\", a businessman, discovering a briefcase full of money and taking it to a hotel room. They discuss whether to turn it in or split it among themselves. When the \"mark\" withdraws to the bathroom, Margaret discovers that he is an undercover cop part of a [[sting operation]]. She warns Mike, and they attempt to escape, but the cop tries to arrest them. After a struggle, Margaret accidentally causes the cop to fatally shoot himself. She, Mike, and Joey escape to the garage, where they force Margaret to steal a car and drive past two uniformed police officers with the con men concealed in the back seat. They drive the car to a riverbank and are preparing to abandon it when they discover that the briefcase, containing $80,000 borrowed from the mafia for the con, is gone. Margaret offers to give Mike $80,000 of her own money so he can repay the mob.\n\nMike tells Margaret they must split up to avoid any police attention, and claims to be going into hiding. Riddled with guilt, Margaret returns to her office and refuses to see any patients. Billy arrives in high spirits, and after a brief conversation, she spots him driving away in the same red convertible that she \"stole\" at the hotel. She tracks him to a bar and sees Mike, all his associates, the man posing as the hotel guest, and the fake undercover policeman, discussing the night's events - a scheme to con Margaret out of $80,000. She also learns that the pocket knife she stole from the hotel room belongs to Mike, who set up the room to appear occupied. He mocks Margaret for stealing it.\n\nAfter overhearing Mike is going to the airport that night, she intercepts him there and says she is so worried about the police that she has withdrawn her entire life's savings. In a non-public area, she pleads with him to start a new life with her. Mike is lured by the money, then realizes he is being tricked when she inadvertently reveals she overheard the con men discussing the pocketknife. He says her money is gone, but she pulls out Billy's gun and demands that he beg for his life. Disbelieving her, Mike refuses, but Margaret shoots him in the leg. When Mike curses her, she shoots him five more times, killing him. She calmly conceals the gun and leaves.\n\nSome time later, Margaret has returned from a vacation, she has written another successful book, and is meeting her friend and colleague Dr. Littauer. They talk over lunch, and Margaret says, \"When you've done something unforgivable, you must forgive yourself, and that's what I've done, and it's done.\" While her friend is away from the table, Margaret distracts another diner and steals a gold [[lighter]] from her purse, relishing the thrill.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lindsay Crouse]] as Dr. Margaret Ford\n*[[Joe Mantegna]] as Mike Mancuso \n*Steven Goldstein as Billy Hahn\n*[[Ricky Jay]] as George\n*[[Mike Nussbaum]] as Joey\n*[[J.

Moran\n\n==Reception==\nDescribing the structure of the film as \"diabolical and impeccable\", [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film his highest rating: 4 stars. \"This movie is awake. I have seen so many films that were sleepwalking through the debris of old plots and second-hand ideas that it was a constant pleasure to watch ''House of Games''.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=House of Games|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/house-of-games-1987|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|date= October 16, 1987|access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref> Ebert later included the film in his list of [[The Great Movies|Great Movies]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Great Movie \u2013 House of Games|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-house-of-games-1987|publisher=Roger Ebert|date=October 31, 1999|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> Calling the film \"a wonderfully devious comedy\", [[Vincent Canby]] also gave it a thumbs up. \"Mr. Mamet, poker player and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, makes a fine, completely self-assured debut directing his original screenplay.

Among the supplemental material included are an audio commentary with Mamet and Ricky Jay, new interviews with actors Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna, and a short documentary shot on location during the film's production.<ref>[http://criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=399 The Criterion Collection: House of Games by David Mamet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Stage adaptation==\nPlaywright [[Richard Bean]] adapted Mamet's script for a production at the [[Almeida Theatre]], London, in September 2010. To meet the confines of the medium the stage version is set in just two locations, and the final resolution between Mike and Margaret is softened. Critical reaction to Bean's version was mixed: [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] found only a \"pointless exercise\", but [[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] thought that the stage version delivered \"far better value than the original picture\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/17/house-of-games-michael-billington|title=House of Games|last=Billington|first=Michael|date=September 17, 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8008947/House-of-Games-Almeida-Theatre-review.html|title=House of Games, Almeida Theatre|last=Spencer|first=Charles|date=September 17, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0093223}}\n* {{Amg movie|23350}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|house_of_games}}\n* {{Mojo title|houseofgames}}\n*{{AFI film|id=57655|title=House of Games}}\n*[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991031/REVIEWS08/910310301/1023 Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies&nbsp;\u2013 House of Games\"]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/609-house-of-games-on-your-mark ''House of Games: On Your Mark''] an essay by Kent Jones at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{David Mamet films}}\n{{Richard Bean}}\n{{London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1987 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s heist films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films about physicians]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Mamet]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Mamet]]\n[[Category:Gambling films]]\n[[Category:Plays by Richard Bean]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
