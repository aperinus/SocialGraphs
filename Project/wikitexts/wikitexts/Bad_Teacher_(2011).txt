Starring [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Lucy Punch]], [[John Michael Higgins]] and [[Jason Segel]], the film tells the story of a lazy  [[middle school]] [[schoolteacher|teacher]] who hates her job, her students, and her co-workers who is forced to return to teaching to make enough money for [[breast implants]] after her wealthy [[fianc\u00e9]] dumps her. ''Bad Teacher'' was released in the [[United States]] on June 24, 2011 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $216.2 million against a $20 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nElizabeth Halsey is a lazy, immoral, manipulative, [[gold-digging]] [[Chicago]] teacher at John Adams Middle School who curses at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana and lets her kids watch movies so she can sleep through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fianc\u00e9, but he dumps her when his mother shows him that Elizabeth is only after his money, so she resumes her job. She tries to win over wealthy substitute teacher Scott Delacorte. Her dedicated and enthusiastic colleague Amy Squirrel also pursues him while Elizabeth rejects advances from the school's gym teacher, Russell Gettis.\n\nElizabeth plans to have her breasts enlarged and becomes more motivated to do so upon learning Scott's ex-girlfriend had large breasts. However, she cannot afford the $9,300 procedure. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery through the 7th grade car wash, wearing provocative clothing and manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy informs the principal about Elizabeth's [[embezzlement]], but he dismisses her claims when no evidence is provided. Scott also admits that he is attracted to Amy and only views Elizabeth as a friend.\n\nDiscovering that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to intensely study ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' for the test. However, since it is late in the school year, combined with her unorthodox teaching methods, the students score low on the book quizzes, further frustrating her. Meanwhile, she befriends Russell, as Amy and Scott start dating.\n\nElizabeth plans to steal the state test answers by impersonating a journalist and seducing Carl Halabi, a state professor in charge of creating and distributing the exams. She convinces Carl to go into his office to have sex, but drugs him and steals the answer key. A month later Elizabeth wins the bonus, completing her needed funds, and books her breast enlargement.\n\nWhen Elizabeth learns that Amy and Scott are chaperoning an upcoming field trip, she smears an apple with [[poison ivy]] and leaves it for Amy, who ends up with blisters covering her face and cannot go. On the trip, Elizabeth seduces Scott. They [[non-penetrative sex|dry hump]] and Elizabeth secretly leaves Amy a message through Scott's phone, recording all the action. However, Scott's ever-changing ideals disappoint Elizabeth. After her student Garrett is taunted by his classmates for confessing to an [[unrequited love|unrequited attraction]] to a superficial girl in the class named Chase, Elizabeth consoles him and helps make him popular, which prompts her to begin reflecting on her own superficial ways.\n\nBack at the school, Amy switches Elizabeth's desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeth's sealed drawer. The evidence Amy finds leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having been informed that her desk was switched, Elizabeth states that teachers in the school use drugs. When the police bring a sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeth's mini liquor bottles, [[marijuana]] and [[OxyContin]] pills in Amy's classroom, in Elizabeth's desk, leading to Amy getting arrested and transferred to another school by the superintendent. Scott asks Elizabeth to start over, but she rejects him in favor of Russell, having learned they have a lot in common.\n\nWhen the new school year starts, Elizabeth reformed. She is kinder to her co-workers, and has started a relationship with Russell, and did not get her breasts enlarged because she feels that it is unnecessary. Elizabeth also has a new position as the new [[School counselor|guidance counselor]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Elizabeth Halsey, a lazy, manipulative, gold-digging, foul mouthed and drug-abusing teacher\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Scott Delacorte, a wealthy substitute teacher whom Elizabeth likes\n* [[Lucy Punch]] as Amy Squirrel, a spiteful and neurotic teacher who wants Elizabeth fired and arrested\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Russell Gettis, a gym teacher who is smitten with Elizabeth\n* [[Phyllis Smith]] as Lynn Davies, Elizabeth's best friend, co-worker and fellow teacher\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Principal Wally Snur, the principal\n* [[Dave Allen (actor)|Dave Allen]] as Sandy Pinkus, a teacher and singer\n* [[Jillian Armenante]] as Ms. Pavicic\n* Matthew J.
