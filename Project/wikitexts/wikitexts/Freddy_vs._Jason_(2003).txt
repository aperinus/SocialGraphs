It is a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] between the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'']] and [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'']] series, being the eighth installment in the former and the eleventh in the latter. The film joins the two series in a [[shared universe]] and pits their respective antagonists, [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]], against each other. Freddy is weakened and forgotten because the citizens of his home town Springwood have defeated him using medications that repress dreams. Freddy awakens Jason to stir up fear and grow his powers so that he may return and kill again. Jason turns out to not be as easily controlled as Freddy initially thought, and the two supernatural mass murderers come into conflict. The crossover film is chronologically set after ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991) and ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'' (1993), and is the last film in each franchise before their respective [[reboot (fiction)|reboots]].\n\n''Freddy vs. Jason'' was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed over $116 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in each series. The film marks [[Robert Englund]]'s final cinematic appearance as Freddy Krueger. A sequel and crossover with the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise was planned, but it was ultimately scrapped and turned into a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], ''[[Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSince [[Freddy's_Dead:_The_Final_Nightmare|his last defeat]], [[Freddy Krueger]] has been in Hell and unable to invade children's [[dream]]s, as the adults of Springwood have gone to extremes to make sure their children have forgotten him. Using his remaining power, Freddy resurrects [[Jason Voorhees]]. Appearing as Jason's mother, [[Pamela Voorhees]], he manipulates Jason into killing the teens of Springwood in order to create a fear in the townsfolk that Freddy has returned, which would allow him to regain his strength.\n\nMeanwhile, Lori Campbell, who lives with her widowed father, has a sleepover with her friends Kia and Gibb. They are later joined by Trey, Gibb's emotionally abusive boyfriend, and his friend Blake. Jason enters the house and murders Trey, and the police suspect Freddy. After a [[nightmare]], Blake awakens to find his father [[Decapitation|decapitated]] by Jason, who then kills Blake himself. The police call it a [[murder\u2013suicide]] the following day, hoping to conceal Freddy's return from the rest of the town.\n\nElsewhere, Lori's ex-boyfriend Will Rollins and his friend Mark Davis, forcibly institutionalized at the Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital, are made to take Hypnocil to suppress their dreams because of their previous contact with Freddy. A news report about the killings prompts them to escape and return to Springwood to warn Lori about Freddy. That night, Lori and the others attend a [[rave]] in a cornfield. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her first in the real world along with others at the rave, angering Freddy, who realises that Jason\u2019s killing spree will deny him victims.\n\nWill, Lori, and Kia escape the rave with school nerd Charlie Linderman and stoner Bill Freeburg. After dropping off the latter three and a confrontation with Dr. Campbell (who was responsible for having Will and Mark committed to Westin Hills) over Will's certainty that he saw Lori's father murder her mother, Will and Lori head to Mark\u2019s house, only to see him get killed by Freddy. Deputy Scott Stubbs, believing Jason is a [[copycat killer]], makes contact with Lori and her friends, who deduce Freddy's plan. Learning about Hypnocil, they try to get it from Westin Hills; however, Freddy possesses Freeburg, using him to dispose of the medicine. Jason arrives and [[Electrocution|electrocutes]] Stubbs. Freddy uses the possessed Freeburg to [[Tranquilizer|tranquilize]] Jason, causing him to fall asleep after slashing Freeburg in half.\n\nThe teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason, bringing the unconscious Jason back home to Camp Crystal Lake, where the real estate is in development. Freddy fights Jason in the dream world, where he discovers that Jason has a subconscious [[Aquaphobia|fear of drowning]]. Freddy uses this to his advantage and Jason becomes afraid, reverting to his younger self. Lori goes to sleep in order to pull Freddy out and save Jason. As Freddy tortures Lori in the dream world, revealing that he murdered her mother, Jason awakens at the real Camp Crystal Lake and pursues the teens, killing Linderman. Lori is awakened and pulls Freddy into the physical world, where he is confronted by Jason.\n\nFreddy and Jason fight throughout the campgrounds, during which Jason kills Kia. Freddy uses the construction site to gain the upper hand and cuts off Jason's fingers, allowing Freddy to take his [[machete]]. As Freddy is slicing away at Jason, Lori distracts him before Jason punches his fingerless hand through Freddy's [[torso]]. Freddy retaliates by plunging Jason's machete into his side and Jason rips Freddy's gloved arm off. Lori and Will set the dock on fire, causing numerous [[propane]] tanks to explode and throwing Freddy and Jason into the lake. Lori and Will embrace as Freddy makes his way to them on the dock and is about to kill the couple with Jason's machete, but he is impaled by Jason with his own clawed arm, allowing Lori to behead Freddy with the machete. Jason falls off the dock and Freddy's head and body sink into the lake, both seemingly dead. After dropping the machete where Jason submerged, Lori and Will leave.\n\nThe following morning, Jason emerges from the water, holding his machete and Freddy's severed head. Freddy winks and his laughter is heard in the background, leaving the winner ambiguous.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]]\n* [[Ken Kirzinger]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n** Spencer Stump as young Jason Voorhees\n* [[Monica Keena]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Lori Campbell|Lori Campbell]]\n* [[Kelly Rowland]] as Kia Waterson\n* [[Jason Ritter]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Will Rollins|Will Rollins]]\n* [[Chris Marquette]] as Charlie Linderman\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Deputy Scott Stubbs\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Gibb Smith\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Mark Davis\n* [[Zack Ward]] as Bobby Davis, Mark's older brother<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/exclusive-interview-zack-ward/|title=Exclusive Interview: Zack Ward {{!}} Friday the 13th: The Website|website=fridaythe13thfilms.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614152024/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/exclusive-interview-zack-ward/|archive-date=2018-06-14|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/zack-ward/12048/|title=Zack Ward biography and filmography {{!}} Zack Ward movies|website=Tribute.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-08}}</ref>\n* [[Kyle Labine]] as Bill Freeburg\n* [[Chris Gauthier]] as Shack\n* David Kopp as Blake\n* [[Jesse Hutch]] as Trey Cooper\n* [[Tom Butler (actor)|Tom Butler]] as Dr. Campbell\n* [[Garry Chalk]] as Sheriff Williams\n* [[Paula Shaw]] as [[Pamela Voorhees]]\n{{div col end}}\nAdditionally, [[Evangeline Lilly]] had a walk-on role as a high-school student.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://horror.about.com/od/horroractorsandactresses/ig/Before-They-Were-Stars/EvangelineLillyFvJ.htm|title=Before They Were Stars: Evangeline Lilly|newspaper=About.com Entertainment|access-date=2017-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://the-back-row.com/blog/2012/04/11/before-they-were-stars-evangeline-lilly-as-an-extra-in-freddy-vs-jason/|title=Before They Were Stars: Evangeline Lilly as an Extra in \"Freddy vs. Jason\"|date=2012-04-11|newspaper=The Back Row|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-US}}</ref> Professional wrestler [[Rey Mysterio|\u00d3scar Guti\u00e9rrez]], better known by his [[ring name]] Rey Mysterio, was Englund's stunt double for a scene in Freddy's boiler room lair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/30-surprising-wwe-facts-you-probably-didnt-know|title=30 Surprising WWE Facts You Probably Didn't Know|date=2016-05-05|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=2017-02-08}}</ref> [[New Line Cinema]] studio chief [[Robert Shaye]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/05/30/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-freddy-vs-jason/|title=13 Things You May Not Know About Freddy Vs.

After ''[[Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan]]'' was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto (who sold them to New Line).

Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing that [[Kane Hodder]], who had played Jason in the previous four films, was the best choice for the role.<ref name=\"Ken\">Bracke, Peter, pp. 280\u2013286</ref> Although Hodder received a script for ''Freddy vs. Jason'' and met with director [[Ronny Yu]] and New Line executives, Yu and Matthew Barry felt that the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason.<ref name=\"Ken\"/> Hodder said that New Line did not give him a reason for the recasting; according to Yu, however, he wanted a taller, slower and more-deliberate Jason.<ref name=\"Hiring Ken\">Grove, David, p. 217</ref> The role went to [[Ken Kirzinger]], a Canadian stuntman who worked on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''. Yu said that Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger is {{convert|6|ft|5|in|cm}} tall, compared to the {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|adj=on}} Hodder, and Yu wanted a much taller actor than the {{convert|5|ft|9|in|cm|adj=on}} Englund. Kirzinger believed that his experience on ''Part VIII'' (doubling for Hodder in two scenes) and his height helped him land the part.<ref name=\"Ken\"/><ref name=\"Hiring Ken\"/> New Line did not cast Kirzinger until they saw him on film, and his first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street.<ref name=\"Ken\"/> [[Douglas Tait (actor)|Douglas Tait]] played Jason in a re-shot ending: \n{{blockquote|Unfortunately for me, it was the only scene I was hired to do. The test audiences were confused about the original ending, they thought Jason Ritter's character was becoming {{sic|Jason}}. You can see it in the deleted scenes, that is why they decided to re-shoot the ending. Originally I was being considered for playing the role of Jason in the entire film. It was actually between me and Ken. When they took the film to Canada, I was out of luck. There was no way they were going to pay for my flight and hotel stay when Ken was a local. Also, Ken is older than me and he was a lot more established in the business than I was at the time ... I was on the film for a couple days. The water sequence took a lot of preparation. They realized that when I got wet, I looked too skinny in the clothes, so they had to bulk me up with pads and extra clothing so it would look like I was still big. Being with all this extra weight, one eye covered, a machete in one hand, Freddy's head in another hand, and being totally submerged in water, made that scene very difficult. Also, Ronny Yu wanted me to walk like I was walking on land. He wanted it to look like I could walk through the water without it making me rise to the surface. To do this effect, they had a rope tied under water that I held onto with my left hand (with Freddy's severed head in it also), and I held myself down on the ground so I could pull myself and walk forward.<ref name=\"fridaythe13thfilms1\">[http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ Interview: Douglas Tait (Jason Voorhees, \u2018Freddy vs Jason\u2019)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016100323/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ |date=2010-10-16 }} fridaythe13thfilms.com October 14, 2010.
