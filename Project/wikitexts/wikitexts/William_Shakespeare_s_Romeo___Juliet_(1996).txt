It is a modernized adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy [[Romeo and Juliet|of the same name]]. The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Claire Danes]] in the title roles of two teenagers who fall in love, despite their being members of feuding families. [[Brian Dennehy]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Harold Perrineau]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Paul Sorvino]] and [[Diane Venora]] also star in supporting roles. It is the third major film version of the play, following a [[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|1936 film]] and a [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|1968 film]].\n\nThe film was released on November 1, 1996, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics,  grossing over $147 million against its $14.5 million budget. At the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1997, DiCaprio won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] and Luhrmann won the [[Alfred Bauer Prize]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |title=Berlinale: 1997 Prize Winners |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archive/jahresarchive/1997/03_preistraeger_1997/03_preistraeger_1997.html |access-date=2022-09-01 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> At the [[69th Academy Awards]], [[Catherine Martin (designer)|Catherine Martin]] and [[Brigitte Broch]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction/Set Decoration]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=1997 {{!}} Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1997 |access-date=2022-09-01 |website=www.oscars.org |language=en}}</ref> In 2005, the film was included on the [[BFI]] list of the \"50 films you should watch by the age of 14\".<ref name=\"CONSIDERING 'THE BFI LIST OF 50 FILMS YOU SHOULD WATCH BY THE AGE OF 14'\">{{cite web |last=Packard |first=Kim |title=Considering 'The BFI List of 50 Films You Should Watch by the Age of 14' |url=https://mubi.com/lists/considering-the-bfi-list-of-50-films-you-should-watch-by-the-age-of-14 |access-date=24 January 2018 |work=MUBI}}</ref>\n\nThe film was also re-released in Luhrmann's ''[[Red Curtain Trilogy]]'' DVD box set in 2002 together with ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992) and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001).\n\n==Plot==\nIn Verona Beach, the Capulets and Montagues are two rival business empires. The animosity of the older generation\u2014Fulgencio and Gloria Capulet and Ted and Caroline Montague\u2014is felt by their younger relatives. A shootout between Montagues led by [[Benvolio]], [[Romeo]]'s cousin, and Capulets led by [[Tybalt]], [[Juliet]]'s cousin, creates chaos in the city. Being the third civil brawl, the [[Chief of Police]], Captain Prince, reprimands the families, warning them that if such an event occurs again, their lives \"shall pay the forfeit of the peace\".\n\nBenvolio and Romeo learn of a Capulet party that evening which they decide to gate-crash. Romeo agrees on hearing that Rosaline, whom he is madly in love with, is attending. They meet their friend, [[Mercutio]], who has tickets to the party, and Romeo takes [[MDMA|ecstasy]] as they proceed to the Capulet mansion. The effects of the drug and the party overwhelm Romeo, who goes to the restroom. There he sees Juliet, and the two instantly fall in love, both unaware of who the other is. Tybalt spots Romeo and vows to kill him for invading his family's home.\n\nAfter Romeo leaves the party, he and Juliet each learn that they belong to feuding families, but Romeo returns to see her. Juliet tells him that if he sends word by the following day, they will be betrothed. The next day, Romeo asks [[Friar Laurence|Father Laurence]] to marry them, and he agrees. Romeo passes the word on via [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|Juliet's nurse]] and they soon get married.\n\nTybalt encounters Mercutio and Romeo at the beach. Romeo attempts to make peace, but Tybalt assaults him. Mercutio intervenes and batters Tybalt, and is about to kill him when Romeo stops him. Tybalt takes the opportunity to fatally wound Mercutio, who curses both houses before dying. Enraged, Romeo chases after the fleeing Tybalt and shoots him dead, avenging Mercutio's death.\n\nCaptain Prince banishes Romeo from the city, and he goes into hiding with Father Laurence. The nurse arrives and tells him that Juliet is waiting for him. Romeo climbs Juliet's balcony and they consummate their marriage, with Romeo departing soon after. Meanwhile, Fulgencio decides Juliet will marry [[Count Paris|Dave Paris]], the governor's son.\n\nThe next morning, Gloria informs Juliet that she is to marry Paris, and when Juliet refuses Fulgencio physically assaults her and threatens to disown her. Juliet runs away and seeks out Father Laurence, imploring him to help her whilst threatening to commit suicide. Father Laurence gives her a potion that will let her fake her own death, after which she will be placed within the Capulet vault to awaken 24 hours later.  Father Laurence vows to inform Romeo of the plot via letter, whereupon the latter will sneak into the vault and, once reunited with Juliet, the two will escape to [[Mantua]]. Romeo does not see the delivered letter however and, believing Juliet to be dead, buys a vial of poison from an apothecary.\n\nRomeo enters the church where Juliet lies and consumes the poison just as Juliet wakes up.  Distraught over Romeo\u2019s death, Juliet picks up his gun and shoots herself in the head, falling down beside his lifeless body. Romeo's body is being taken inside an ambulance with a crowd of spectators and reporters observing the incident from behind the police line, when the parents of both Romeo and Juliet arrive in the scene. Captain Prince approaches their fathers, and berates them for the deaths of his kinsmen that their foolish brawl has caused.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|Characters in Romeo and Juliet}}\n{{Col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-3}}\n;The House of Montague\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Lord Montague|Ted Montague]], Romeo's father<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lahr|first1=John|title=Where do Claire Danes' Volcanic Performances Come From?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/09/varieties-of-disturbance-2|website=New Yorker Magazine|publisher=New Yorker Magazine|access-date=September 9, 2013|ref=2|page=2|date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as [[Lady Montague|Caroline Montague]], Romeo's mother\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Romeo]]\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as [[Benvolio]], Romeo's cousin\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as [[Romeo and Juliet#Characters|Balthasar]], Romeo's cousin\n* [[Zak Orth]] as [[Romeo and Juliet#Characters|Gregory]], Romeo's cousin\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as [[Romeo and Juliet#Characters|Sampson]], Romeo's cousin\n{{col-3}}\n;The House of Capulet\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as [[Lord Capulet|Fulgencio Capulet]], Juliet's father\n* [[Diane Venora]] as [[Lady Capulet|Gloria Capulet]], Juliet's mother\n* [[Claire Danes]] as [[Juliet]]\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Tybalt]], Juliet's cousin\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as [[Romeo and Juliet#Characters|Abra]], Juliet's cousin\n* Carlos Mart\u00edn Manzo Ot\u00e1lora as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Petruchio|Petruchio]], Juliet's cousin\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|Nurse]], Juliet's nanny\n{{col-3}}\n;Others\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as [[Mercutio]], Romeo's best friend\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as [[Friar Laurence|Father Laurence]], the priest who marries Romeo and Juliet\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Count Paris|Dave Paris]], the governor's son and Juliet's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Prince Escalus|Captain Prince]], the chief of police\n* [[M.

After the success of his 1992 film ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', Baz Luhrmann took some time over deciding what his next project would be:\n<blockquote>Our philosophy has always been that we think up what we need in our life, choose something creative that will make that life fulfilling, and then follow that road. With ''Romeo and Juliet'' what I wanted to do was to look at the way in which Shakespeare might make a movie of one of his plays if he was a director. How would he make it? We don't know a lot about Shakespeare, but we do know he would make a 'movie' movie. He was a player. We know about the Elizabethan stage and that he was playing for 3000 drunken punters, from the street sweeper to the Queen of England \u2013 and his competition was bear-baiting and prostitution. So he was a relentless entertainer and a user of incredible devices and theatrical tricks to ultimately create something of meaning and convey a story. That was what we wanted to do.<ref name=\"signet\">[https://archive.today/20130222065050/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Baz+Luhrmann&bl \"Interview with Baz Luhrmann\", ''Signet'', 19 December 1996] accessed 19 November 2012</ref></blockquote>\nLuhrmann obtained some funds from [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] to do a workshop and shoot some teaser footage in [[Sydney]]. Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to pay his own expenses to fly to Sydney and be part of it. Once Fox saw footage of the fight scene, they agreed to support it.<ref name=\"signet\" />\n\nAll of the development was done in Australia, with pre-production in Australia and Canada and post-production in Australia. While some parts of the film were shot in [[Miami]], most of the film was shot in [[Mexico City]] and Boca del Rio, [[Veracruz]].

We filmed in [[Mexico City]], paradise for someone like me who loves fossicking around flea markets and antiques shops, and, like me, Leonardo was into bling in a big way, too.

It was obvious to all of us that she really was in love with her Romeo, but Leonardo wasn't in love with her. She wasn't his type at all. He didn't know how to cope with her evident infatuation. He wasn't sensitive to her feelings, was dismissive of her and could be quite nasty in his keenness to get away, while Claire was utterly sincere and so open. It was painful to watch. Many years later, I was in a restaurant and she came up to me and said: 'We worked together on a film once, I don't know if you remember me? My name is Claire Danes.'
