It is based on the 1942 [[The Harvey Girls (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], about [[Fred Harvey (entrepreneur)|Fred Harvey]]'s [[Fred Harvey Company#Harvey Girls|Harvey House waitresses]].<ref>Zaballos, Nausica (2014) ''Mythes et Gastronomie de l'Ouest am\u00e9ricain: sur la route'' Paris: Le Square. pp.101-110.</ref> Directed by [[George Sidney]], the film stars [[Judy Garland]] and features [[John Hodiak]], [[Ray Bolger]], and [[Angela Lansbury]], as well as [[Preston Foster]], [[Virginia O'Brien]], [[Kenny Baker (American performer)|Kenny Baker]], [[Marjorie Main]]  and [[Chill Wills]]. Future star [[Cyd Charisse]] appears in her first speaking role on film.\n\n''The Harvey Girls'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe]]\", written by [[Harry Warren]] and [[Johnny Mercer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1890s, a group of \"Harvey Girls\"&nbsp;\u2013 new waitresses for [[Fred Harvey (entrepreneur)|Fred Harvey]]'s pioneering chain of [[Fred Harvey Company|Harvey House]] restaurants&nbsp;\u2013 travels on the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] to the western town of Sandrock, Arizona. On the trip they meet Susan Bradley, who is travelling to the same town to marry the man whose beautiful letters she received when she answered a [[Personal advertisement|\"lonely-hearts\" ad]]. \n\nUnfortunately, when she arrives, her husband-to-be turns out to be an \"old coot\" who does not at all meet her expectations.  They start to argue and list each other's personal faults, both claiming none was mentioned in each other's letters. With their mutual disinclination to continue with the marital union clear,  they jointly decide to call off the wedding.\n\nWith the marriage safely cancelled, he reveals to Susan that his letters were actually ghost-written as a joke by Ned Trent, the local saloon owner. Susan, rightly furious, confronts Ned to tell him off, in the process endearing herself to him.\n\nSusan joins the Harvey Girls, and she soon becomes their leader in fighting against the attempts by Trent's business associate, Judge Sam Purvis. Purvis wants to scare them away in order to maintain his own thriving business running the large saloon in town. The Harvey Girls also face the animosity of the so-called \"dance-hall girls,\" led by Em, who is in love with Trent and sees Susan as a rival. \n\nTrent visits the Harvey House and see its value along with the other trappings of civilization and then tells Purvis to leave them alone. Purvis continues with his campaign of intimidation, finally burning down the restaurant. Trent offers his saloon as a replacement, and Em and the dance-hall girls leave town. Susan, thinking that Trent too is leaving, gets on the train, but Em, seeing that Susan loves Trent so much that she is willing to give up everything for him, stops the train and points out Trent, riding toward them on his horse. Ultimately, they wed in the desert, surrounded by the Harvey Girls.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Judy Garland John Hodiak The Harvey Girls.JPG|thumb|225px|Judy Garland and John Hodiak in ''The Harvey Girls'']]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Susan Bradley\n* [[John Hodiak]] as Ned Trent\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as Chris Maule\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Em\n* [[Preston Foster]] as Judge Sam Purvis\n* [[Virginia O'Brien]] as Alma\n* [[Kenny Baker (singer)|Kenny Baker]] as Terry O'Hara\n* [[Marjorie Main]] as Sonora Cassidy\n* [[Chill Wills]] as H.H.

Unfortunately, Garland wanted to work with [[Fred Astaire]] on ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]'', which was directed by fianc\u00e9 [[Vincente Minnelli]].

Judy Garland is the film's bright ... star. Miss Garland is effectively glamorized in get-ups of the (18)90's and sings her songs pleasantly. ''The Harvey Girls'' is a perfect demonstration of what Hollywood can do with its vast resources when it wants to be really showy ... pretty girls&nbsp;\u2013 period sets and costumes&nbsp;\u2013 lilting tunes&nbsp;\u2013 super-speedy dance shuffles.\"\n\nThe ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said it was \"A nostalgic whiff of the old west. Judy sings several sentimental ballads, as well as ''On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe'' number. Her chief support in the way of real entertainment comes from [[Ray Bolger]].\" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote \"A technicolored musical celebrating the coming of chastity, clean silverware, and crumbless tablecloths to the pioneer Southwest. The bearers of this culture, according to evidence presented here, were waitresses. ''The Harvey Girls'' is good fun in spots.
