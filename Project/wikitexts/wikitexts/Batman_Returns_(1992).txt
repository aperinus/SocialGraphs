Based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], it is the sequel to ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and the second installment in the [[Batman (1989 film series)|1989\u20131997 ''Batman'' series]]. In the film, the superhero vigilante Batman comes into conflict with wealthy industrialist Max Shreck and deformed crime boss [[Oswald Cobblepot (Batman Returns)|Oswald Cobbleplot / Penguin]], who seek power, influence, and respect regardless of the cost to Gotham City. Their plans are complicated by [[Selina Kyle (1989 film series character)|Selina Kyle]], Shreck's formerly-meek secretary, who seeks vengeance against Shreck as Catwoman. The cast includes [[Michael Keaton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Michael Gough]], [[Pat Hingle]], and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]].\n\nBurton had no interest in making a sequel to the successful ''Batman'', believing that he was creatively restricted by the expectations of [[Warner Bros.]] He agreed to return in exchange for significant creative control, including replacing original writer [[Sam Hamm]] with Daniel Waters and hiring many of his previous creative collaborators. Waters' script focused more on characterization than on overarching plot, and [[Wesley Strick]] was hired to complete an uncredited re-write which (among other elements) provided a master plan for the Penguin. Filming was done from September 1991 to February 1992, on a $50\u201380{{nbsp}}million budget, on sets and sound stages at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]] and the [[Universal Studios Lot]] in California. Special effects primarily involved practical applications and makeup, with some animatronics and [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was substantial, including brand collaborations and a variety of merchandise to replicate ''Batman''{{'s}} success. Released on June 19, 1992, ''Batman Returns'' broke several box-office records and earned about $266.8{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It failed to replicate the success or longevity of ''Batman'' ($411.6{{nbsp}}million), however; this was blamed on its darker tone and violent (or sexual) elements, which alienated family audiences and led to a backlash against marketing partners{{snd}}such as [[McDonald's]]{{snd}}for promoting the film to young children. Reviews were critical of its tone and narrative but more favorable towards the cast, giving near-unanimous praise to Pfeiffer's performance.\n\n[[Joel Schumacher]] was hired to direct the third film, ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995), after the relative failure of ''Batman Returns'' to make the series more family-friendly. Keaton chose not to reprise his role, disagreeing with Schumacher's vision. ''Batman Forever'' was a financial success, but less well-received critically. The fourth film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), was a critical and commercial failure and is considered one of the worst superhero films ever made. Its failure stalled the ''Batman'' film franchise until ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), the series reboot. ''Batman Returns'' has been reassessed as one of the best ''Batman'' films in the decades since its release, and its incarnations of Catwoman and Penguin are considered iconic. A comic book, ''[[Batman '89 (comic book)|Batman '89]]'' (2021), continued the narrative of the original two Burton films and Keaton is expected to reprise his version of Batman in the [[DC Extended Universe]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per [[WP: FILMPLOT]], aspects of the narrative are told out of chronological order to make it easier to read -->\nTwo wealthy [[socialite]]s, dismayed at the birth of their malformed and feral son Oswald Cobblepot, discard the infant in the sewers, where he is adopted by a family of penguins. Thirty-three years later, during the Christmas season, wealthy industrialist Max Shreck is abducted by the Red Triangle gang (a group of former circus workers connected to child disappearances across the country) and brought to their hideout in the Arctic exhibit at the derelict Gotham Zoo. Red Triangle's leader, Oswald \u2013 now named [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] \u2013 blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corruption and murderous acts to compel his assistance in reintegrating Oswald into Gotham's elite. Shreck orchestrates a staged attempted kidnapping attempt of the mayor's infant child, allowing Oswald to rescue it and become a public hero. In exchange, Oswald requests access to the city's birth records (ostensibly to learn his true identity) and identifies Gotham's first-born sons.\n\nShreck attempts to kill his meek secretary, Selina Kyle, by pushing her out a window after she inadvertently uncovers his plot to build a power plant which would covertly siphon and hoard electricity from Gotham. Selina survives, returns home, angrily crafts a costume and adopts the name Catwoman. She returns to work confident and aggressive, catching the attention of visiting billionaire Bruce Wayne. As his alter ego (the vigilante Batman), Wayne investigates Oswald, suspecting that he is connected to Red Triangle. To eliminate opposition to his plant, Shreck convinces Oswald to run for mayor and discredit the incumbent by having Red Triangle wreak havoc throughout Gotham. Batman's efforts to stop the gang eventually bring him into conflict with Catwoman. Selina and Wayne begin dating, while Catwoman allies with Oswald to disgrace Batman.\n\nOn the night of the city's Christmas-tree lighting, Oswald and Catwoman kidnap the Ice Princess (Gotham's beauty queen) and lure Batman to the roof above the ceremony. Oswald pushes the Ice Princess to her death with a swarm of bats, framing Batman. When Catwoman objects to the murder and rejects his romantic advances, Oswald attacks her and she falls through a glasshouse. Batman escapes in the [[Batmobile]], unaware that Red Triangle has modified it; this allows Oswald to take it on a remote-controlled rampage. Before regaining control, Batman records Oswald's derogatory tirade against Gotham's citizens. He plays the audio at Oswald's mayoral rally the following day, ruining his image and forcing him to retreat to Gotham Zoo. Oswald forsakes his humanity and embraces the name Penguin, initiating his plan to abduct and kill Gotham's firstborn sons to avenge his own abandonment.\n\nSelina tries to kill Shreck at his charity ball, but Wayne intervenes and they inadvertently discovers each other's secret identities. Penguin crashes the event to kidnap Shreck's son, Chip, but Shreck offers himself instead. Batman neutralizes Red Triangle and stops the kidnapping, forcing Penguin to deploy his missile-equipped penguin army to destroy Gotham. Batman's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], overrides the penguins' control signal and redirects them back to Gotham Zoo. As the missiles destroy the zoo, Batman unleashes a swarm of bats which makes Penguin fall into the contaminated waters of the Arctic exhibit. Catwoman arrives to kill Shreck, rejecting Batman's plea to abandon her vengeance and leave with him. She is shot four times by Shreck, seemingly without effect, because she claims to have two of her [[Cat#Superstitions and rituals|nine lives]] remaining. Catwoman electrocutes Shreck, causing an power surge which apparently kills them both; however, Batman finds only Shreck's charred remains. Penguin returns, but dies of his injuries before he can attack Batman and is laid to rest in the water by his penguins. Sometime later, while Alfred drives him home, Wayne sees Selina's silhouette but finds only a cat (which he takes with him). The [[Bat-Signal]] shines above the city, as Catwoman looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Michael Keaton]] ''(in 2002)'', [[Danny DeVito]] ''(in 2013)'', and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] ''(in 2007)''\n| image1 = Michael Keaton Cannes.jpg\n| alt1 = A formally-dressed Michael Keaton\n| image2 = Danny DeVito cropped and edited for brightness.jpg\n| alt2 = A smiling Danny DeVito\n| image3 = Michelle Pfeiffer 2007.jpg\n| alt3 = A smiling Michelle Pfeiffer\n}}\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman (1989 film series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]: A billionaire businessman who operates as Gotham's vigilante protector<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/><ref name=\"Vulture2017\"/>\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as [[Oswald Cobblepot (Batman Returns)|Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin]]: A deformed crime boss<ref name=\"Vulture2017\"/>\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Selina Kyle (1989 film series character)|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]: A meek assistant turned vengeful villain<ref name=\"Vulture2017\"/><ref name=\"ReviewEW\"/>\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Max Shreck: A ruthless industrialist<ref name=\"Vulture2017\"/><ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/>\n* [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth: Wayne's butler and surrogate father<ref name=\"DOGAlfred\"/>\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as [[Jim Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]: The Gotham City police commissioner and Batman's ally<ref name=\"CBRGordon\"/>\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as the Mayor:  The city's incumbent mayor<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/><ref name=\"ReviewEbert\"/>\n\nThe cast of ''Batman Returns'' includes [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as Max's son Charles \"Chip\" Schreck and [[Cristi Conaway]] as the Ice Princess, Gotham's beauty queen-elect.<ref name=\"CastChip\"/><ref name=\"CastIcePrincess\"/><ref name=\"CastBFI\"/> [[Paul Reubens]] and [[Diane Salinger]] appear as Tucker and Esther Cobblepot, Oswald's wealthy, elite parents.<ref name=\"CastTheCobblepots\"/> [[Sean Whalen]] appears as a paperboy; [[Jan Hooks]] and [[Steve Witting]] play Jen and Josh, Oswald's mayoral [[image consulting|image consultants]].{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"CastBFI\"/><ref name=\"CastComicsAlliance\"/><ref name=\"CastNyTimes\"/><ref name=\"CastVanityFair\"/>}} The Red Triangle gang includes the monkey-toting Organ Grinder ([[Vincent Schiavelli]]), the Poodle Lady ([[Anna Katarina]]), the Tattooed Strongman ([[Rick Zumwalt]]), the Sword Swallower (John Strong), the Knifethrower Dame (Erika Andersch), the Acrobatic Thug ([[Gregory Scott Cummins]]), the Terrifying Clown ([[Branscombe Richmond]]), the Fat Clown (Travis Mckenna), and the Thin Clown ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]).<ref name=\"CastBFI\"/><ref name=\"CastIGN\"/><ref name=\"CastCollider\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Tim Burton by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|alt=A smiling Tim Burton, dressed in black|[[Tim Burton]] ''(pictured in 2012)'' agreed to direct ''Batman Returns'' in exchange for greater creative control.]]\nAfter the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), the fifth-highest-grossing of its time, a sequel was considered inevitable. [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] had confidence in its potential and was discussing sequel ideas by late 1989, intending to begin filming the following May;{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"AFICatalog\"/>{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=62}}<ref name=\"NYTimesBOAnalJune22\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>}} the studio had purchased the $2{{nbsp}}million Gotham City sets at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England for at least two sequels. It kept the sets under 24-hour guard because it was cheaper to maintain the existing sets than build new ones. [[Robin Williams]] and Danny DeVito were considered to play rogues [[Riddler]] and Penguin, respectively.{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=62}} Despite pressure from Warner Bros. to finalize a script and begin filming, ''Batman'' director [[Tim Burton]] remained uncertain about directing a sequel.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/>{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=62}}<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> He described it as a \"dumbfounded idea\", especially before ''Batman''{{'}}s performance was analyzed,{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=62}}<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"TCM\"/> and was generally opposed to sequels: \"Sequels are only worthwhile if they give you the opportunity to do something new and interesting. It has to go beyond that, really, because you do the first for the thrill of the unknown. A sequel wipes all that out, so you must explore the next level.\"{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=62}}<ref name=\"TCM\"/> \n''Batman'' writer [[Sam Hamm]]'s initial story idea expanded the character of district attorney [[Harvey Dent]], played in ''Batman'' by [[Billy Dee Williams]], and his descent into the supervillain [[Two-Face]]. Warner Bros. wanted the main villain to be the Penguin, however, and Hamm believed that the studio saw the character as Batman's most prominent enemy after the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. Catwoman was added because Burton and Hamm were interested in the character.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Hamm's drafts continued directly from ''Batman'', focusing on the relationship between Wayne and Vicki Vale ([[Kim Basinger]]) and their engagement.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> The Penguin was written as an avian-themed criminal who uses birds as weapons; Catwoman was more overtly sexualised, wore \"bondage\" gear, and nonchalantly murdered groups of men.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> The main narrative teamed Penguin and Catwoman to frame Batman for the murders of Gotham's wealthiest citizens in their pursuit of a secret treasure. Their quest leads them to Wayne Manor, and reveals the Waynes' secret history. Among other things, Hamm originated the Christmastime setting and introduced [[Robin (character)|Robin]], Batman's sidekick, although his idea for [[assault rifle]]-wielding [[Santa]]s was abandoned. Hamm ensured that Batman did not kill anyone, and focused on protecting Gotham's homeless.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> He produced two drafts which failed to renew Burton's interest,<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"TCM\"/> and the director concentrated on directing ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and writing ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/>\n\nBurton was confirmed to direct the sequel in January 1991, with filming scheduled to begin later that year for a 1992 release date.<ref name=\"LAtimesJan1991\"/> He agreed to return if he received creative control of the sequel; Burton considered ''Batman'' the least favorite of his films, describing it as a \"little boring at times.\"<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>{{sfn|White|1992|p=8}} According to [[Denise Di Novi]], his long-time producer, \"Only about 50% of ''Batman'' was [Burton]\"; the studio wanted ''Batman Returns'' to be \"more of a Tim Burton movie{{nbsp}}...

We were really just about the art.\"<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"VultureWaters\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> He also had no interest in preventing Batman from killing people; the character should reflect contemporary, \"darker\" times, and the idea of a hero leaving captured villains for the authorities was outdated.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Waters only had Batman kill when necessary, however, believing that it should be meaningful; he was unhappy with some of the added on-screen deaths, such as Batman blowing up a Red Triangle member with a bomb.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/>\n\nMuch of Waters' \"bitter and cynical\" dialogue for Batman (such as Gotham City not deserving protection) was removed because Keaton believed that Batman should rarely speak in costume and Burton wanted Batman to be a \"wounded soul,\" not nihilistic.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"VultureWaters\"/>{{sfn|Shapiro|1992|p=62}}}} As a result, the script focused on villains. Burton said that he initially struggled to understand the appeal of the Penguin's comic-book counterpart; Batman, Catwoman, and the Joker had clear psychological profiles, but the Penguin was \"just this guy with a cigarette and a top hat.\"<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> The initial draft made the character resemble a stereotypical DeVito character (an abrasive gangster), but Waters and Burton agreed to make him more \"animalistic.\"{{sfn|Shapiro|1992|p=32}} They decided to make the Penguin a tragic figure, abandoned as an infant by his parents{{snd}}a reflection of Batman's childhood trauma of losing his parents.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Political and social satire was added, influenced by two episodes of the 1960s television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (\"Hizzoner the Penguin\" and \"Dizhonner the Penguin\") in which the Penguin runs for mayor.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>\n\nWaters changed Hamm's Catwoman from a \"fetishy sexual fantasy\" ''[[femme fatale]]'' to a working-class, disenchanted secretary, writing her as an allegory of contemporary feminism.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"TCM\"/> Although the character is influenced by feline mythology (such as cats having nine lives), Waters and Burton never intended the belief to be taken literally and planned for Catwoman to die with Shreck during the electrical explosion in the film's denouement.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"CBRCatwomanNineLives\"/> Waters created Max Shreck as an original character, named in honor of actor [[Max Schreck]], to replace the Dent-Two-Face character.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"TCM\"/> The character was written satirically as an evil industrialist who orchestrates the Penguin's mayoral run because Waters wanted to say \"that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes.\" In one version of the script, Shreck was the Penguin's more-favored brother.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> The number of central characters led to the removal of Robin, a garage mechanic who helps Batman after Penguin crashes the Batmobile.

''Batman Returns'' was filmed entirely on seven or eight soundstages at [[Warner Bros.

Cast and crew had to wear ID badges with the film's [[Working title#Title ruse|working title]], ''Dictel'', a word coined by Welch and Burton meaning \"dictatorial\"; they were unhappy with the studio's \"ridiculous gestapo\" measures.<ref name=\"EWSetsAppeal\"/> Welch designed the [[Batboat]] vehicle, a programmable [[batarang]], and the Penguin's weaponized umbrellas. He added features to the Batmobile, such as detaching much of its exterior to fit through tighter spaces; this version was called the \"Batmissile.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/>{{sfn|White|1992|p=11}}\n\n===Sets===\nThe sets were redesigned in Welch's style, including the Batcave and Wayne Manor. They were spread across seven soundstages on the Warner Bros. lot (the largest of which had {{cvt|70|ft|m}} ceilings) and the largest set owned by Universal Pictures.{{sfn|White|1992|p=10}}<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> ''Batman Returns'' was filmed on sets, although some panoramic shots (such as the camera traveling from the base of Shreck's department store to its cat-head-shaped office) were created with detailed miniatures.<ref name=\"EWSetsAppeal\"/>\n\nWelch found it difficult to create something new without deviating from Furst's award-winning work. The designs were intended to appear as a separate district of Gotham; if ''Batman'' took place on the East Side, ''Batman Returns'' was set on the West Side.<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> Welch was influenced by [[German Expressionism]], neo-fascist architecture (including [[Nazi Germany]]-era styles), American [[precisionism]] painters, and photos of the homeless living on the streets in affluent areas. He incorporated Burton's rough sketch of Catwoman, which had a \"very S&M kind of look,\" by adding chains and steel elements which would appear to hold together a city on the verge of collapse.<ref name=\"AFICatalog\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/>{{sfn|White|1992|p=11}} The key element for Welch came early in design, when he realized that he wanted to manipulate spaces to convey specific emotions (emphasizing vertical buildings to convey a \"huge, overwhelmingly corrupt, decaying city\" filled with small people): \"The film is about this alienating, disparate world we live in.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> The wintertime setting took advantage of the contrast between black and white scene elements, influenced by ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949).{{sfn|White|1992|p=11}}\n\nWelch's concept designs began by carving out building shapes from cardboard with images of fascist sculptures and [[depression era]] machine-age art. The resulting {{cvt|1|by|4|ft|m}}-tall rough model represented Gotham Plaza, described as a futuristic, oppressive, and \"demented caricature\" of [[Rockefeller Center]].<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> It was designed overbuilt, emphasizing the generic-but-oppressive heart of Gotham's corruption. Despite complaints from the film's financiers about its necessity, Burton insisted on the location with a detailed church overshadowed by plain surroundings.<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/><ref name=\"EWSetsAppeal\"/>\n\nDesigns attempted to create the illusion of space; the Wayne Manor set was partially built (consisting primarily of a large staircase and fireplace) with a scale which implied that the rest of the structure was massive.<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> Penguin's base was initially scheduled to be built in a standard {{cvt|35|ft|m}} tall Warner Bros. soundstage, but Welch thought that it lacked \"majesty\" and did not create enough contrast between itself and the \"evil, filthy, little bug of a man.\" A {{cvt|50|ft|m}}-tall Universal stage was acquired for the production, its raised ceilings making it seem more realistic and less like a set.<ref name=\"EWSetsAppeal\"/> Minor modifications were made to the set throughout the film to make it appear to be gradually deteriorating.<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> The location featured a water tank filled with {{cvt|500000|USgal|liter}} of water surrounding a faux-ice island.{{sfn|Resner|1992}} Selina Kyle's apartment had a large steel beam running through its center to appear as if it had been built around a steel girder, which Welch said made it depressing and ironic.<ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> The wood used to build the sets was donated to [[Habitat for Humanity]] to help build low-cost homes for the poor.<ref name=\"AFICatalog\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Costumes and make-up}}Costumes and makeup===\n[[File:Batman Returns Penguin Makeup.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A collage of photos depicting the application of makeup and prosthetics to Danny DeVito's face to play the Penguin|To transform into the Penguin, [[Danny DeVito]] wore a combination of prosthetics and makeup which covered much of his face.]]\n[[Bob Ringwood]] and Mary E.

Ringwood and Vogt struggled with adding stitching to latex. They tried to sculpt stitching and glue it on, but did not like the look and went over the suit with liquid silicon while it was worn (which added a shine to everything).<ref name=\"AnotherMagCatwoman\"/> Pfeiffer said that the suit was like a second skin, but when worn for long periods it was uncomfortable; there was no way to use the restroom and it would stick to her skin, occasionally causing a rash. She found the mask similarly confining, describing it as choking her or \"smashing my face,\" and would catch the claws on nearby objects.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"Macleans\"/>\n\nStan Winston Studio created an \"over-the-top Burtonesque\" visual for the Penguin, without obscuring DeVito's face. Concept artist Mark McCreery drew a number of sketches for the look, from which [[Legacy Effects]] built noses on a [[Lifecasting|lifecast]] of DeVito's face. Winston was unhappy with the \"pointy nose\" shapes and began sculpting ideas with clay, influenced by his work on ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978) (which involved a forehead and brow prosthetic appliance for large-beaked creatures). The final makeup included a T-shaped appliance which went over DeVito's noise, lip and brow as well as crooked teeth, whitened skin and dark circles under his eyes. Ve Neill applied the makeup, made by [[John Rosengrant]] and [[Shane Mahan]].<ref name=\"StanWinstonPenguin\"/> The several pounds of facial prosthetics, body padding, and prosthetic hands took four-and-a-half hours to apply to DeVito, but was reduced to three hours by the end of filming.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"TCM\"/><ref name=\"MTVBrando\"/> An air bladder was added to the costume to help reduce its weight.{{sfn|Fennell|1992|p=40}} DeVito helped create the Penguin's black saliva with the makeup and effects teams, using a mild mouthwash and food coloring which he squirted into his mouth before filming, and said its taste was acceptable.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/> Burton described DeVito as completely in-character in costume, and he \"scared everybody.\" While [[Automated dialogue replacement|re-dubbing some of his dialogue]], DeVito struggled to get into character without the makeup and had it applied to improve his performance.<ref name=\"StanWinstonPenguin\"/> Because of the secrecy surrounding his character's appearance before marketing, DeVito was not allowed to discuss it with others (including his family).<ref name=\"TCM\"/><ref name=\"MTVBrando\"/> A photo leaked to the press, and Warner Bros. employed a firm of private investigators in a failed attempt to track down the source.{{sfn|Resner|1992}}\n\n===Penguins===\n[[Stan Winston|Stan Winston Studio]] provided animatronic penguins and costumes to supplement Penguin's army.

Mechanical-effects designers Richard Landon and Craig Caton-Largent supervised the manufacture of the animatronics, which required nearly 200 different mechanical parts to control the head, neck, eyes, beak, and wings.<ref name=\"StanWinstonPenguinArmy\"/> [[Boss Film Studios]] produced the CGI penguins.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/><ref name=\"AFICatalog\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Context===\n{{See also|1992 in film}}\nBy the theatrical summer of 1992 (beginning the last week of May), the film industry was struggling.

The series was written by Hamm, with art by Joe Quinones.<ref name=\"DOGBatman89\"/> To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Penguin's first comic-book appearance, DeVito wrote \"Bird Cat Love\" a 2021 comic book story about the Penguin and Catwoman falling in love and ending the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=\"CatBirdLovePolygon\"/><ref name=\"CatBirdLoveGuardian\"/> The Red Triangle Gang made their first appearance outside ''Batman Returns'' in the 2022 comic book ''Robin'' #15.<ref name=\"RedTriangleComics\"/><ref name=\"RedTriangleComics2\"/>\n\n==Thematic analysis==\n\n===Duality===\n<!-- Didn't check Crow's quote, but \"duality\" is a mathematical term; think the appropriate term here is \"dualism\". -->\nCritic David Crow called duality a major aspect of ''Batman Returns'', and Catwoman, Penguin, and Shreck represent warped, reflected aspects of Batman.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"ReviewWaPoKempley\"/> Like Wayne (Batman), Selina (Catwoman) is driven by trauma and conflicted about her principles and desires; unlike Batman (who seeks justice), however, she seeks vengeance.<ref name=\"Vulture2017\"/><ref name=\"ReviewTribuneKehr\"/> Although Catwoman agrees with Batman's appeal that they are \"the same, split right down the center\", they still differ too much to be together.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Critics Darren Mooney and Betsy Sharkey suggested that Penguin reflects Batman's origin; each lost their parents at an early age. Shreck says that if not for his abandonment, Cobblepot and Wayne might have traveled in the same social circles. Batman is content in his loneliness, however; the Penguin wants acceptance, love and respect, despite his quest for revenge.<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesWelch\"/> To Mooney, ''Batman Returns'' hints that Batman's issues with Penguin are personal rather than moral; Batman is quietly proud of being a \"freak\" (unique), and resents Penguin for displaying his \"freakishness\".<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/> Shreck represents Wayne's public persona if it was driven by greed, vanity, and self-interest: a populist industrialist who wins favor with cheap presents tossed into a crowd.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>\n\n===Commercialism and loneliness===\n\nCrow saw ''Batman Returns'' as a denouncement of Batman's real-world cultural popularity and merchandising (especially in the wake of the previous film), and noted that a scene of a store filled with Batman merchandise being destroyed was removed from the film.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Crow and Mooney wrote that ''Batman Returns'' is \"saturated with Christmas energy\"; it rejects the season's conventional norms and becomes an anti-Christmas film, however, critquing its over-commercialism and lack of true goodwill. Shreck cynically exploits Christmas tropes for his own ends (falsely portraying himself as selfless and benevolent), and the perversions of Penguin's Red Triangle gang are a more overt rejection of the holiday.<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>\n\nThe film focuses on loneliness and isolation during Christmastime; Wayne is introduced sitting alone in his vast mansion, inert until the Bat-Signal shines in the sky. He makes a connection with Kyle, but what they share cannot overcome their differences and he ends the film as he began it{{snd}}alone.<ref name=\"Escapist2020\"/> Critic [[Todd McCarthy]] identified isolation as a theme common to much of Burton's work, which is emphasized in the three main characters.<ref name=\"ReviewVarietyMcCarthy\"/>\n\nRebecca Roiphe and Daniel Cooper wrote that ''Batman Returns'' was not [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]], but had antisemitic imagery. The Penguin, they believed, embodied Jewish stereotypes such as \"{{nbsp}}... his hooked nose, pale face and lust for herring\" and was \"unathletic and seemingly unthreatening but who, in fact, wants to murder every [[Firstborn (Judaism)|firstborn]] child of the gentile community.\" The character joins forces with Shreck (who has a Jewish-sounding name) to disrupt and taint Christmas and Christian traditions.<ref name=\"ScreenRantAnti\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesAnti\"/>\n\n===Sexuality and misogyny===\n''Batman Returns'' has overtly sexual elements. Critic Tom Breihan described Catwoman's vinyl catsuit as \"pure [[BDSM]],\" including the whip she wields as a weapon. The dialogue is replete with [[double entendre]]s, particularly by Penguin and Catwoman; in her fights with Batman, she sensuously licks his face.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"AVClub2022\"/> Selina / Catwoman is marginalized by the central male characters, however; Shreck pushes her out of a window, the Penguin tries to kill her when she spurns his advances, and Batman attempts to capture her. She fashions a catsuit to regain order, sanity, and power, but it is gradually damaged over the course of the film and her sanity decays with it. Catwoman's final choice is to reject Batman's offer of a happy ending by \nabandoning her revenge against Shreck; to surrender herself to Batman's will would allow another man to control her.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>\n\n===Power and politics===\nPower is a central theme for several characters; Shreck says, \"There's no such thing as too much power; if my life has a meaning that's the meaning.\"<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> He uses his money to gain power, and Batman uses his fortune to fund his war against crime (unlike Penguin, who was abandoned because he did not fit the image expected by his wealthy parents).<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/> Kyle gains power by donning the Catwoman costume and embracing her anger and sexuality.<ref name=\"ReviewEWBurr\"/><ref name=\"ReviewTribuneKehr\"/>\n\nShreck convinces Penguin to run for mayor to further his own goals, and the Penguin seeks out the acceptance and respect it would give him. Critic Caryn James wrote that ''Batman Returns'' has \"sharp political jabs\" which implies that money and image are more important than anything else.<ref name=\"NYTimesCarynJames\"/> In ''Batman'', the Joker buys citizen support by throwing them piles of money; in the sequel, Shreck and Penguin gain the support of the populace with spectacle, pandering, and corporate showmanship. The Penguin describes how he and Shreck are both seen as monsters, but Shreck is a \"well-respected monster and I, to date, am not.\" James said that the Penguin wants to change the superficial perception of himself because he wants to be accepted, but has no interest in being lovable.<ref name=\"TheRinger2022\"/><ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesCarynJames\"/> Only when the fickle voters turn on him, however, does he resort to his plan to kill infants who had the chances he never had. Crow believed that Burton was the most sympathetic to Penguin, and spent the most time on the character.<ref name=\"DOGBatmanRetro\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Cultural influence===\n[[File:Dragon Con 2015 - Oswald Cobblepot & Selina Kyle (21716989458).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A photograph of cosplayers{{snd}}a man dressed as the Penguin and a woman dressed as Catwoman|[[Cosplayers]] at the 2015 [[Dragon Con]] dressed as the ''Batman Returns'' versions of Penguin and Catwoman]]\nRetrospectives in the 2010s and 2020s noted that ''Batman Returns'' had developed an enduring legacy since its release, with ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' describing it as the most iconic comic-book film ever made.

believed ''Batman Returns'' was exploring new territory at the time, but it might be considered \"tame\" by modern standards.<ref name=\"THRReturnsat25\"/> According to ''[[The Ringer (website)|the

Christmas (despite its July release).<ref name=\"ColliderRetro\"/> Some publications have identified it as part of Burton's unofficial Christmas trilogy, bookended by ''Edward Scissorhands'' and ''The

The fourth and final film, ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (1997), was a financial and critical failure and is regarded as one of the worst [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films ever made. It stalled the Batman film series for eight years until the reboot, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"DOGBatman3\"/><ref name=\"PolygonRetro\"/><ref name=\"NYTimeschumachObit\"/><ref name=\"TheWrapSequels\"/>}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Burton and Waters were signed to direct a Catwoman-centered film starring Pfeiffer.<ref name=\"VarietyCatwoman\"/><ref name=\"VarietyCatwoman2\"/> Waters' plot depicted Catwoman as an amnesiac after her injuries at the end of ''Batman Returns'', who ends up in the [[Las Vegas]]-like Oasisburg and confronts publicly-virtuous male superheroes who are secretly corrupt. Burton and Pfeiffer took on other projects in the interim, and lost interest in the film.
