A [[standalone sequel]] called ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe]]'' was released in 2020 on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\nPhineas and Ferb start another summer day playing with Perry and are inspired by him to create an enormous [[shuttlecock]] to play platypult (platypus + catapult) badminton. Perry enters his secret lair and is warned by [[Major Monogram]] that he's had some close calls with his \"host family\" (the Flynn-Fletchers) almost seeing him enter his lair. He then reminds Perry that if his cover's blown, he'll have to be relocated to another city, with another host family and that he'll never see Phineas and Ferb again and also reveals that Perry has an auto-scan replication device in his hat which he has used to scan and replicate all of Doofenshmirtz's \"inators\" to determine whether Doofenshmirtz is getting smarter or not. \n\nPerry leaves the lair in a hovercraft, but accidentally collides with the boys' shuttlecock while both are in flight, sending them off course. Doofenshmirtz begins his plan with his \"Other-Dimension-inator\", intended to create portals to parallel dimensions, but it fails to function and Phineas and Ferb crash into it a few moments later. Meanwhile, Candice, feeling she is immature, decides to act more like an adult and use this mindset to bust the boys herself. However, she discovers that the boy's invention has disappeared and concludes the same \"mysterious force\" she believes keeps the boys from being busted is working against her now, and tries to find the source of it.\n\nPhineas and Ferb assist Doofenshmirtz (oblivious that he is evil) in repairing the machine and build a remote that allows them to use the portals anywhere. Perry arrives to stop Doofenshmirtz, but not wanting to reveal his identity and put Phineas and Ferb in danger, reverts to pet mode and fails to stop them. Doofenshmirtz, Phineas, Ferb, and Perry travel to a parallel dimension, where an alternate version of Doofenshmirtz has successfully conquered the Tri-State Area with an army of robots and installed himself as dictator. \nDoofenshmirtz meets his counterpart, Doofenshmirtz-2, who has also converted Perry-2 into a Platyborg (platypus cyborg), who now serves as his second-in-command. Recognizing Perry as a secret agent, Doofenshmirtz-2 forces Perry to reveal his secret identity by having Platyborg attack them, much to the boys' shock. They escape, but Phineas is angry with Perry for his deception. Doofenshmirtz-2 explains to Doofenshmirtz that he was driven to evil because he lost a toy train as a child, enraging Doofenshmirtz as his backstory is much more tragic and yet he still hasn't accomplished anything. \n\nWhen the boys try to use the remote to return home, they discover they can't open a portal back to their own dimension and seek out their parallel-dimension selves, while Doofenshmirtz-2 plans to use another Other-Dimension-Inator reconstructed by Doofenshmirtz to invade the first Tri-State area and annex it into his regime. The boys meet their counterparts, who have been oppressed under Doofenshmirtz-2's rule, and introduce them to the concept of Summer. When Doofenshmirtz-2 makes a public announcement that he will spare Phineas and Ferb if Perry surrenders himself, Perry agrees to the deal, but before he leaves is told by an angry Phineas that he is no longer their pet. When Doofenshmirtz-2 learns that the boys had made some modifications to the Other-Dimension-inator that helped it to function, he reneges on the deal. \n\nPhineas, Ferb, and their counterparts ask the alternate Isabella for help and find that she, as well as the alternate Baljeet and Buford, are part of an underground resistance organization led by the alternate Candace. Baljeet-2 explains that it takes a large amount of energy to open against the flow of dimensions, but he is able to open a highly unstable portal backwards into the first dimension. Upon learning about Perry's capture, Phineas and Ferb decide to rescue Perry before they can leave. In the first dimension, Candace spots the portal and, believing it to be the mysterious force, jumps through, causing it to collapse. The kids catch Candace up to speed and set off to rescue Perry, but are captured by Doofenshmirtz-2 and his forces. \n\nPerry distracts Doofenshmirtz-2 with a video call of Monogram in the shower, allowing the boys to escape in minecarts through a tunnel. Platyborg attacks and damages one of the carts, slowing them down. Unwilling to endanger her own brothers, Candace-2 escapes with Phineas-2 and Ferb-2, but abandons Phineas, Ferb, Candace, and Perry, who are subsequently captured by Doofenshmirtz-2. The boys refuse to fix the machine, but inadvertently remind Doofenshmirtz how they fixed the machine by removing the [[self-destruct]] button. \n\nAfter Doofenshmirtz powers up the machine, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders Phineas, Ferb, Candace, and Perry to be fed to a monster called the Goozim; when Doofenshmirtz annoys him again, Doofenshmirtz-2 orders his execution as well. Before the five can be eaten, Candace-2 rescues them and gives them the remote, allowing Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Perry, and Doofenshmirtz to escape to yet another dimension, but Candace-2 herself is captured and imprisoned. Doofenshmirtz-2 invades the first dimension with an army of robots. \n\nMeanwhile, Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Perry, and Doofenshmirtz, having traveled through a cyclic path of many dimensions, arrive back in the first dimension. Perry gives Phineas and Ferb the locket off his collar, which is a key that leads them to Perry's lair. Inside, they find out that Perry had scanned and replicated all their previous inventions. With the help of their friends, the children of Danville, and the O.W.C.A. agents, Phineas and Ferb use the inventions to fight Doofenshmirtz-2's robot invasion, while Candace-2 is freed from prison by Phineas-2, Ferb-2, and Jeremy-2. Phineas and Perry climb to the top of Doofenshmritz's building to shut down the invasion where Perry defeats Platyborg by shoving his spiked tail into a power outlet, electrocuting him. Phineas manages to destroy the satellite controlling the robots, disabling Doofenshmirtz-2's entire army. Meanwhile, Candace, who has given up on becoming an adult early after seeing how miserable it made her alternate self become, races to show her parents (who are watching a movie and believe the invasion is just 3-D effects) the invasion in order to use the mysterious force to her advantage.\n\nDoofenshmirtz-2 tries to destroy Perry, Phineas and Ferb in revenge for foiling his invasion with a giant robot, but Doofenshmirtz arrives and gives Doofenshmirtz-2 his own toy train (since he never lost it), resolving his tragic backstory. Doofenshmirtz-2 stands down his invasion and destroys the remains of his robot army with a self-destruct button just in time for Candace to fail to bust her brothers, much to her joy for once. Doofenshmritz-2 is arrested when he returns home and several characters from the other dimension arrive in the original dimension to thank their counterparts for saving the day before returning.\n\nPlatyborg's electrocution reverts him to his normal self and Phineas-2 and Ferb-2 take him home and Candace advises her counterpart to pursue a relationship with Jeremy-2 before she leaves. The kids are distraught to learn that Perry will be relocated since his cover is blown, but Carl uses Doofenshmirtz's [[Amnesia]]-inator to erase their memories so they can keep Perry, though Doofenshmirtz has his memories erased by force. Before they forget, Phineas and Ferb say their goodbyes to Perry, and Isabella takes the moment to kiss Phineas just before their memories are erased. Later, Perry enters his lair and uploads photos of the events.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vincent Martella]] as [[Phineas Flynn]] / 2nd Dimension Phineas\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]] as [[Ferb Fletcher]]\n** [[Danny Jacob]] as The Singing Voice of Ferb and his 2nd Dimension counterpart\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as [[Perry the Platypus]] / Perry The Platyborg / Pinky The Chihuahua\n* [[Dan Povenmire]] as [[Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz]] / 2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz / 2nd Dimension Candace (allergy affected)\n* [[Ashley Tisdale]] as [[Candace Flynn]]/2nd Dimension Candace\n* [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]] as Major Monogram / 2nd Dimension Monogram\n* Tyler Alexander Mann as Carl The Intern\n* [[Mitchel Musso]] as Jeremy Johnson / 2nd Dimension Jeremy\n* [[Alyson Stoner]] as Isabella Garcia-Shapiro / 2nd Dimension Isabella\n* [[Caroline Rhea]] as Linda Flynn-Fletcher / 2nd Dimension Linda\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Lawrence Fletcher / 2nd Dimension Lawrence\n* [[John Viener]] as Norm / Normbots\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Normbots (deep voice)\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Stacy Hirano\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Baljeet Rai / Dr. Baljeet\n* Bobby Gaylor as Buford Van Stomm / 2nd Dimension Buford\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as Irving Du Bois\n* [[Jaret Reddick]] as Danny\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as Bobbi Fabulous\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Sherman \"Swampy\"\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mrs. Thompson\n* [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] as Himself\n* [[Loni Love]] as Carl's Pet Store Owner Disguise\n* [[Ariel Winter]] as 2nd Dimension Gretchen\n* [[Todd Stashwick]] as Mr. Johnson\n* [[Olivia Olson]] as Vanessa Doofenshmirtz / 2nd Dimension Vanessa (singing voice and speaking cameo in deleted scenes only)\n}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Phineas and Ferb: Across the 1st and 2nd Dimensions\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = Cast \u2013 Phineas and Ferb\n| cover        = \n| alt          =\n| released     = {{Start date|2011|08|02}}\n| recorded     = 2009\u20132011/2007 and 2011*(*extended version on track 8)\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = {{flatlist|\n*[[Soundtrack]]\n*[[soul music|soul]]\n*[[R&B]]\n*[[funk]]\n*[[Pop music|pop]]\n*[[doo-wop]]\n*[[pop rock]]\n*[[sunshine pop]]\n*[[jazz]]\n*[[bubblegum pop]]\n*[[pop punk]]\n*[[alternative rock]]\n*[[alternative metal]]\n*[[show tune]]\n*[[patter song]]\n*[[musical theatre|musical]]\n*[[Children's music|Children's]]\n}}\n| length       = 39:52 (Original)\n| label        = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]] / [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer     =\n| chronology   = Cast \u2013 Phineas and Ferb\n| prev_title   = Phineas and Ferb Holiday Favorites\n| prev_year    = 2010\n| next_title   = Phineas and Ferb-ulous: The Ultimate Album\n| next_year    = 2011\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie '''''Phineas and Ferb: Across the 1st and 2nd Dimensions''''' includes 8 songs from the movie and 14 songs from the series, released on August 2.

As of November 12, 2019, the film, along with the series, have been available to stream on [[Disney+]] and used the original broadcast version instead of the edited version on DVD.\n\n===Video games===\n====Console game====\n{{main|Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension (video game)}}\nA video game based on the movie was released. In it, players assume the role of Phineas, Ferb, their 2nd Dimension forms, as well as Agent P and a character exclusive to the game, Agent T,  as they travel through worlds. The characters use gadgets such as baseball launchers and Carbonators (soda blasters) to defeat enemies. Scenes from the movie are present in the game. The game was released on August 2, 2011 for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. The PS3 version also has four episodes of the show in [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] format as a bonus feature.\n\n====Online game====\nA separate online game titled ''[http://disneychannel.com/doom Phineas and Ferb The Movie Game: The Dimension of Doooom!]'' was released when the website for Across the 2nd Dimension was launched. The game plays very similar to its predecessor, ''Transport-inators of Doooom!'', of which it even shares its name with.\n\nIn the game, the player plays as Phineas, Ferb, Agent P, or the Candace of the 2nd Dimension (and after the game is beaten, the Phineas and Ferb of the 2nd Dimension as well). Each character has a glider to help get/fly through the air, and a ray gun to defeat nearby enemies and break boxes. The start and end of most levels have full-voiced cutscenes, however, they do not follow the storyline of the actual film, but rather one all its own. In game, Isabella and Baljeet of the 2nd Dimension appear to give the player guidelines.
