The movie had a huge buildup, and viewers expected it to be another hit for the National Lampoon franchise, because it was following ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', the company's first big-screen release in 1978. The original company consisted of the writers from the ''National Lampoon'' magazine and some of the cast from the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' and the stage show ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]''.<ref>[[List of National Lampoon films|National Lampoon Wiki link]]</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n''National Lampoon's Class Reunion'' suffered negative reviews on release.\n\nAccording to ''[[TV Guide]]'', \"this is a very unfunny film which was released after the successful ''National Lampoon's Animal House'', and which died at the box office, focuses on the 10th reunion of a 1972 high-school graduating class. The plot combines both comedy and horror-slasher elements, a combination that doesn't work. A murderer is killing off class members, who are such dull, dreary creatures no one could blame him. Even Chuck Berry, who makes brief appearance singing a medley of his songs, can't save this one.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/national-lampoons-class-reunion/107254/|title=National Lampoon's Class Reunion|website=TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tookey]] states, \"Very inferior follow-up to ''Animal House'', with remarkably tasteless basis for comedy. John Hughes can be blamed for the script, a feeble spoof of a slasher movie. Songs are used to extend running length, but even Chuck Berry seems under par.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-film-review.com/devfilm.asp?id=7917/|title=Movie Film Review \u2013 Chris Tookey \u2013 Tookey's Film Guide \u2013 Reviews Since 1902|website=www.movie-film-review.com}}</ref>\n\nMovie historian [[Leonard Maltin]] seemed to agree, citing the picture as a \"BOMB\" and calling it \"Spectacularly unfunny...If you went to school with people like this, no jury on earth would convict you for becoming a homicidal maniac, either.\"<ref>Maltin's TV, Movie, & Video Guide</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.mgm.com/#/our-titles/1333/National-Lampoon%27s-Class-Reunion}} at MGM.com\n* {{IMDb title|0084395}}\n* {{AllMovie title|61524}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|national_lampoons_class_reunion}}\n\n{{John Hughes}}\n{{National Lampoon}}\n\n[[Category:1982 films]]\n[[Category:1980s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:ABC Motion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Class reunions in popular culture]]\n[[Category:1980s parody films]]\n[[Category:National Lampoon films|Class Reunion]]\n[[Category:1980s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Hughes (filmmaker)]]\n[[Category:Parodies of horror]]\n[[Category:1982 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Miller (director)]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
