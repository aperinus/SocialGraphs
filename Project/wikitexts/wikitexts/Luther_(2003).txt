The film covers Luther's life from his becoming a monk in 1505, to his trial before the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530. The American-German co-production<ref>{{Cite web|title=LUTHER (2003)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b87eba723|access-date=2021-10-23|website=BFI|language=en}}</ref> was partially funded by [[Thrivent]], a Christian financial services company.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Share |first1=John |title=Four partners help Thrivent market Luther movie |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2003/09/29/story7.html |access-date=4 January 2022}}</ref>\n\nThis marked the final film appearance of Sir Peter Ustinov before his death in March 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins during a thunderstorm in 1505, as Luther is returning to his home. For fear of losing his life in the storm, Luther commits his life to God and becomes an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk.\n\nTwo years later, Luther is a monk at [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] in [[Erfurt]]. During his time at the monastery, he is constantly troubled by viewing God as a God of hate and vengeance. Martin is encouraged by [[Johann von Staupitz]], an elder monk who is his supervisor and mentor. Staupitz tells Luther to look to [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] instead of himself.\n\nLater, Luther delivers a letter for Staupitz to [[Rome]], where he becomes troubled by the wicked lifestyles of those in the city. He also views the skull believed to be that of [[John the Baptist]] and purchases an [[indulgence]]. It is during this time that Luther begins to question the veracity of indulgences. Returning to Germany, Luther is sent to [[Wittenberg]], where he begins to teach his congregation that God is not a God of hate, but a God of love. Luther begins to emphasize the love of God instead of his judgment.\n\nIn 1513, [[Pope Leo X]] becomes the new Pope of the Church, and commissions [[Johann Tetzel]] to go throughout several communities, including Luther's town, where he scares people into buying indulgences, which would be used to rebuild and renovate [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and to recover the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] bribes to the [[Holy See]], advanced by [[Jakob Fugger|Fugger]], for the [[investiture]] of [[Archbishop]] [[Albert of Mainz|Albert of Mainz and Magdeburg]]. In his church, Luther denounces the indulgences, calling them \"just a piece of paper\". He then posts his [[Ninety-five Theses|95 theses]] on the door of the church, calling for an open debate regarding the indulgences. For this act, Luther is called in 1518 to [[Augsburg]], where he is questioned by [[Thomas Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]] among other church officials.\n\nAfter his excommunication, Pope Leo X orders Luther to be delivered to Rome, but [[Prince-elector]] [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] becomes his  protector. Frederick and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] decide that Luther will be tried at the [[Diet of Worms]].\n\nAt Worms, Luther is brought before Charles V and the Cardinals for trial. The Cardinals demand for him to recant of his teachings, and Luther requests more time to give a decent answer, which is granted. The next day, Luther comes before Charles V and the Cardinals, who demand him to recant, and Luther refuses. After his trial at Worms, Luther is forced into hiding by Frederick the Wise who protects him by moving him into [[Wartburg Castle]], while his former professor, [[Andreas Karlstadt]], encourages the [[German Peasants' War|Great Peasants' Revolt]] against the oppressive nobles. Luther, shocked by the revolts, encourages the princes to put them down. Meanwhile, Luther translates the [[Bible]] into German.\n\nAfter Luther marries [[Katharina von Bora]], a former nun, Charles V summons the evangelical [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the [[Diet of Augsburg]], so he can force them to outlaw [[Protestantism]] and the German Bible. The nobles refuse, and Charles is forced to allow the nobles to read their [[Augsburg Confession]].\n\nThe film ends with the following words:\n<blockquote>\n[[Diet of Augsburg|What happened at Augsburg]] pushed open the door of religious freedom. Martin Luther lived for another 16 years, preaching and teaching the Word. He and Katharina von Bora enjoyed a happy marriage and six children. Luther's influence extended into economics, politics, education and music, and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] became a foundation stone of the [[German language]].\n\nToday over 540 million people worship in churches inspired by his Reformation.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as [[Martin Luther]]\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as [[Johann Tetzel]]\n* [[Jonathan Firth]] as [[Girolamo Aleandro|Girolamo Aleander]]\n* [[Claire Cox]] as [[Katharina von Bora]]\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Frederick the Wise]]\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as [[Johann von Staupitz]]\n* [[Uwe Ochsenknecht]] as [[Pope Leo X]]\n* [[Mathieu Carri\u00e8re]] as [[Cardinal Cajetan]]\n* [[Benjamin Sadler]] as [[George Spalatin|Spalatin]]\n* [[Jochen Horst]] as [[Andreas Karlstadt|Professor Karlstadt]]\n* [[Torben Liebrecht]] as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]\n* [[Maria Simon (actress)|Maria Simon]] as Hanna\n* [[Lars Rudolph]] as [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]]\n* [[Marco Hofschneider]] as Ulrick\n* [[Christopher Buchholz]] as [[Johann Eck|Johann von der Eck]]\n* [[Timothy Peach]] as [[Karl von Miltitz]]\n* Michael Traynor as [[Hans Luther (15th century)|Hans Luther]]\n* Tom Strauss as [[George of Brandenburg]]\n* Gene Reed as [[John, Elector of Saxony|John of Saxony]]\n* Anian Zollner as [[Philip of Hesse]]\n* Johannes Lang as [[Albert of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]]\n* [[Jeff Boyd]] as Prior\n* [[Jeff Caster]] as Matthew\n* [[Anatole Taubman]] as Otto\n}}\n\n== Historical inaccuracies ==\n{{Original research|date=June 2013}}\n* In the film, Luther refers to Bible passages by the book, chapter, and verse. However, the Bible was not divided into verses until 1551, and even then, the divisions were not ubiquitous until the [[Geneva Bible]]. (It can be assumed that this was done so that discerning viewers might easily locate the text to which Luther refers.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/chapter-verse.html|title=Chapter and Verse Divisions of the Bible}}</ref>\n* [[Albert of Mainz]] is described as being archbishop of two German territories before acquiring Mainz. In reality, he was [[Archbishop of Magdeburg|Prince-Archbishop of Magdeburg]] and [[Prince-Bishop of Halberstadt]], prior to gaining Mainz.\n* During the [[Augsburg Confession]] scene, all of the nobles, including the [[prince-elector]]s, stood up to Charles V. In real life, most of the princes were still Catholic. Only one (or maybe two) of the seven electors would have made a stand, [[John, Elector of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and the somewhat conciliant [[Louis V, Elector Palatine]]. Three other electors were Catholic archbishops, such as Albert of Mainz, and two more secular electors sided with the Catholics, the King of Bohemia, Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], and [[Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim Nestor of Brandenburg]], Albert's brother. After the Elector of Saxony and [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]], the staunchest opposition came from Georg [the Pious], Prince-Margrave of [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. \n* The film stated that Luther and Spalatin went to law school together. In reality, they did not meet until much later.\n* The film implies that Frederick of Saxony was given the [[Golden Rose]] as a bribe to deliver Luther to Rome. In real life, he had already been awarded the rose, most likely to make him run for emperorship against Charles.\n* Aleander addresses Cajetan as cardinal in his first appearance, which apparently takes place shortly after the papal conclave that elected Leo X in 1513. In reality, Cajetan did not become a cardinal until four years later.\n* The film regularly portrays congregants seated in [[pew]]s. In reality, pews were not a common church fixture until after the Reformation.<ref>[http://anglicanhistory.org/misc/freechurch/fowler_pews1844.html The Use of Pews] Anglican History.org</ref>\n* [[Andreas Karlstadt]] is depicted as radically distorting Luther's views while Luther is in seclusion at [[Wartburg]], insisting on being addressed as \"Brother Andreas.\" Though the reforms actually orchestrated by Karlstadt were more peaceful, they were too radical for Luther (including [[wikt:vernacular|vernacularization]] of the Mass), and Luther began to undo or slow them. Karlstadt also did not renounce his title of professor until after Luther's return.\n* In the film, Luther returns to visit Wittenberg incognito (at the urging of George Spalatin) with a modest growth of beard and under the title \"Knight George.\"  Luther actually had grown a beard \"sufficient to deceive his mother\" and gone under the name \"Junker George,\" which means \"Knight George\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Here I Stand. A Life of Martin Luther|last=Bainton|first=Roland H.|publisher=Abingdon Cokesbury Press|year=1950|pages=194, 205}}</ref> \n* Shortly before Prince Frederick convinces Charles to give Luther a hearing at the [[Diet of Worms]], the Emperor introduces Aleander to him as a \"new cardinal\", and Aleander's dress supports that. Aleander would in fact not become a cardinal for another 15 years.\n* It is implied in the film that Luther and Katharina married shortly after the death of Pope Leo X. In reality, Leo died over a year before Luther and Katharina had even met.\n* At the end of the movie, Luther goes to the study of Duke Frederick with a \"birthday gift.\" He hands the duke a copy of the New Testament in German. There is no historical evidence that Duke Frederick and Martin Luther ever met or spoke face to face.\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of {{RT data|score}}, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}, based on {{RT data|count}} reviews.
