Please keep this section within the 400-700-word of WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nThe film opens with a sequence of European Grand Prix races won by the same car over an instrumental version of the main theme (\"[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (song)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]\"), concluding with the eponymous car crashing and burning in 1909. Years later, widowed inventor Caractacus Potts is raising two young children, Jeremy and Jemima (\"[[You Two]]\"), who have become fond of the crashed ex-racer, housed at a local rural English garage. When they learn the car is due to be [[scrap metal|scrapped]], they beg Caractacus to save it, so he demonstrates numerous unsuccessful inventions to raise money, including a disastrous attempt to market a musical hard candy (\"Toot Sweets\") that summons stray dogs instead. Discouraged, he sings the children a lullaby that night (\"[[Hushabye Mountain]]\") and brings them to a carnival the next day, where he earns tips from a spirited song-and-dance act (\"[[Me Ol' Bamboo]]\"). He purchases the car and rebuilds it as \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" for its unusual engine sounds. In the first trip in the car, Caractacus and the children picnic on the beach with [[Truly Scrumptious]], a wealthy woman with whom they have previously had awkward encounters (\"[[Truly Scrumptious (song)|Truly Scrumptious]]\").\n\nCaractacus tells the children a tale about nasty Baron Bomburst, the tyrant of fictional Vulgaria, who wants to steal Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but the quartet escape Bomburst's pirates after the car transforms into a boat. On the way home, they stop to drop Truly off at Scrumptious Manor (\"[[Lovely Lonely Man]]\"). The tenacious Baron has sent two spies to capture the car, but they instead kidnap Truly's father, Lord Scrumptious, then Caractacus' father, Grandpa Potts, mistaking each for the car's creator. Arriving home, they see Grandpa Potts being taken away by [[Chitty Bang Bang (airship)|airship]] (\"[[Posh!]]\") and follow it to Vulgaria, as the car sprouts wings and propellers to fly. Grandpa is taken to the castle, and has been ordered by the Baron to make another floating car just for him. He bluffs his abilities to the Baron to avoid being executed. The Potts' party is helped and hidden by the local Toymaker, who now works only for the childish Baron. Chitty is discovered and then taken to the castle. While Caractacus and the Toymaker search for Grandpa and Truly searches for food, the children are kidnapped by the Baroness's [[Child Catcher]], as children are against the law in Vulgaria under Bomburst's rule.\n\nThe Toymaker takes Truly and Caractacus to a grotto beneath the castle where the townspeople have been hiding their children (\"Hushabye Mountain\" (reprise)). Grandpa and the other inventors rally their spirits by celebrating numerous failures to replicate the car (\"[[The Roses of Success]]\"). The Toymaker, Truly, and Caractacus concoct a scheme to free the children and the village from the Baron. As a present for the Baron's birthday (\"Chu-Chi Face\"), the Toymaker sneaks the pair into the castle disguised as life-size dolls (\"[[Doll on a Music Box]] / Truly Scrumptious\"). Caractacus snares the Baron, and the children swarm into the banquet hall, overcoming the Baron's palace guards and guests. In the ensuing chaos, the Baron, Baroness, and the evil Child Catcher are captured. Jeremy and Jemima are freed by Caractacus and Truly and fight against the guards. Chitty comes to their rescue and, at the same time, they are reunited with Grandpa. The Potts family and Truly bid farewell to the Toymaker and the rest of the village, then fly back home to England (\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (Finale)).\n\nWhen Caractacus finishes the story, they set off for home again; Caractacus dismisses any possibility of a future together with Truly, which she regards as inverted snobbery. The Potts family arrive back at their cottage where Lord Scrumptious surprises Caractacus with an offer to buy the Toot Sweets as a canine confection, re-naming them Woof Sweets. Caractacus, realising that he will be rich, rushes to tell Truly the news. They kiss, and Truly agrees to marry him. As they drive home, he acknowledges the importance of pragmatism as the car takes off into the air again, this time without wings.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgm.com/#/our-titles/377/Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang |title=Chitty Chitty Bang Bang |publisher=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] |access-date=5 July 2018 |archive-date=19 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619063913/https://www.mgm.com/#/our-titles/377/Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as [[Caractacus Potts]]\n* [[Sally Ann Howes]] as [[Truly Scrumptious]]\n* [[Adrian Hall (actor)|Adrian Hall]] as Jeremy Potts\n* [[Heather Ripley]] as Jemima Potts\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Grandpa Potts\n* [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] as Baron Bomburst\n* [[Anna Quayle]] as Baroness Bomburst\n* [[Benny Hill]] as the Toymaker\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Lord Scrumptious\n* [[Robert Helpmann]] as the [[Child Catcher]]\n* [[Barbara Windsor]] as Blonde\n* [[Davy Kaye]] as Admiral\n* [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] as the Chancellor\n* [[Peter Arne]] as the Captain of the Guard\n* [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as Mr Coggins\n* [[Victor Maddern]] as Junkman\n* [[Arthur Mullard]] as Cyril\n* [[Max Wall]] as Inventor\n* [[Gerald Campion]] as Minister\n* [[Max Bacon (actor)|Max Bacon]] as Orchestra Leader\n* [[Alexander Dor\u00e9]] as First Spy\n* [[Bernard Spear]] as Second Spy\n* [[Richard Wattis]] as Philips, the Secretary at Sweet Factory (uncredited)\n}}\n\nThe part of Truly Scrumptious had originally been offered to [[Julie Andrews]], to reunite her with Van Dyke after their success in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.

Some of the songs were edited to fit the time constraints of the standard 12 inch LPs of the time and to create a fluid listening experience.\n\nThe soundtrack has been released on CD four times, the first two releases using the original LP masters rather than going back to the original movie masters to compile a more complete soundtrack album with underscoring and complete versions of songs. The 1997 [[Rykodisc]] release included several short bits of dialogue from the film between some of the tracks, but otherwise used the same LP master and has gone out of circulation. On 24 February 2004, a few months after MGM released the movie on a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] reissued a newly remastered soundtrack album without the dialogue tracks, restoring it to its original 1968 LP format.\n\nIn 2011, Kritzerland released the definitive soundtrack album, a two-CD set featuring the original soundtrack album plus bonus tracks, music from the \"Song and Picture-Book Album\" on disc 1, and the Richard Sherman demos, as well as six playback tracks (including a long version of international covers of the theme song). This release was limited to only 1,000 units.<ref>{{cite web| title=Chitty Chitty Bang Bang| url=http://www.kritzerland.com/chitty.htm| publisher=Kritzerland| access-date=25 March 2018| archive-date=10 March 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310195040/http://www.kritzerland.com/chitty.htm| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, [[Perseverance Records]] re-released the Kritzerland double CD set with expansive new liner notes by John Trujillo and a new booklet by Perseverance regular James Wingrove.\n\nNo definitive release of the original film soundtrack featuring the performances that lock to picture without the dialogue and effects can be made, as the original isolated scoring session recordings were lost or discarded once United Artists merged its archives.

A separate novelisation of the film was published at the time of the film's release.
