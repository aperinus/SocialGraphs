The film is loosely based on the 1959 novel ''[[King's Ransom (novel)|King's Ransom]]'' by [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain (Evan Hunter)]].\n\n==Plot==\nA wealthy executive named Kingo Gondo ([[Toshiro Mifune]]) is in a struggle to gain control of a company called National Shoes. One faction wants the company to make cheap, low quality shoes for the impulse market as opposed to the sturdy and high quality shoes currently being produced. Gondo believes that the long-term future of the company will be best served by well made shoes with modern styling, though this plan is unpopular because it means lower profits in the short term. He has secretly set up a [[leveraged buyout]] to gain control of the company, mortgaging all he has.\n\nJust as he is about to put his plan into action, he receives a phone call from someone claiming to have kidnapped his son, Jun. Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, but the call is dismissed as a prank when Jun comes in from playing outside. However, Jun's playmate, Shinichi, the child of Gondo's chauffeur, is missing and the kidnappers have mistakenly abducted him instead.\n\nIn another phone call the kidnapper reveals that he has discovered his mistake but still demands the same ransom. Gondo is now forced to make a decision about whether to pay the ransom to save the child or complete the buyout. After a long night of contemplation Gondo announces that he will not pay the ransom, explaining that doing so would not only mean the loss of his position in the company, but cause him to go into debt and throw the futures of his wife and son into jeopardy. His plans are weakened when his top aide lets the \"cheap shoes\" faction know about the kidnapping in return for a promotion should they take over. Finally, under pressure from his wife and the chauffeur, Gondo decides to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper's instructions, the money is put into two small briefcases and thrown from a moving train; Shinichi is found unharmed.\n\nGondo is forced out of the company and his creditors demand the collateral in lieu of debt. The story is widely reported however, making Gondo a hero, while the National Shoe Company is vilified and boycotted. Meanwhile, the police eventually find the hideout where Shinichi was kept prisoner. The bodies of the kidnapper's two accomplices are found there, killed by an overdose of heroin. The police surmise that the kidnapper engineered their deaths by supplying them with uncut drugs. Further clues lead to the identity of the kidnapper, a medical intern at a nearby hospital, but there is no hard evidence linking him to the accomplices' murders.\n\nThe police lay a trap by first planting a false story in the newspapers implying that the accomplices are still alive, and then forging a note from them demanding more drugs. The kidnapper is then apprehended in the act of trying to supply another lethal dose of uncut heroin to his accomplices, after testing the strength on a drug addict who overdoses and dies. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo's property from auction. With the kidnapper facing a death sentence, he requests to see Gondo while in prison and Gondo finally meets him face to face. Gondo has gone to work for a rival shoe company, earning less money but enjoying a free hand in running it. The kidnapper at first feigns no regrets for his actions. As he reveals that envy from seeing Gondo's house on the hill every day led him to conceive of the crime, his emotions gradually gain control over him and he ends up breaking down emotionally before Gondo after finally facing his failure.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Toshiro Mifune]] as {{nihongo|Kingo Gondo|\u6a29\u85e4 \u91d1\u543e|Gondo Kingo}}\n*[[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as {{nihongo|Inspector Tokura|\u6238\u5009\u8b66\u90e8}}, the chief investigator in the kidnapping case.\n*[[Ky\u014dko Kagawa]] as {{nihongo|Reiko Gondo|\u6a29\u85e4\u4f36\u5b50|Gondo Reiko}}\n*[[Tatsuya Mihashi]] as {{nihongo|Kawanishi|\u6cb3\u897f}}, Gondo's secretary.\n*Kenjiro Ishiyama as {{nihongo|Chief Detective 'Bos'n' Taguchi|\u7530\u53e3}}, Tokura's partner.\n*[[Isao Kimura]] as {{nihongo|Detective Arai|\u8352\u4e95}}\n*[[Takeshi Kat\u014d (actor)|Takeshi Kat\u014d]] as {{nihongo|Detective Nakao|\u4e2d\u5c3e}}\n*Yutaka Sada as {{nihongo|Aoki|\u9752\u6728}}, Gondo's Chauffeur.\n*[[Tsutomu Yamazaki]] as  {{nihongo|Ginjir\u00f4 Takeuchi|\u7af9\u5185 \u9280\u6b21\u90ce|Takeuchi Ginjiro}}, the mastermind and chief instigator of the kidnapping plot.\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] as the Chief of the Investigation Section\n*[[Susumu Fujita]] as Manager of Investigations\n*[[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as {{nihongo|Detective Murata|\u6751\u7530}} \n*[[Jun Tazaki]] as {{nihongo|Kamiya, National Shoes Publicity Director|\u795e\u8c37}} \n*[[Nobuo Nakamura]] as {{nihongo|Ishimaru, National Shoes Design Department Director|\u77f3\u4e38}} \n*[[Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d|Yunosuke Ito]] as {{nihongo|Baba, National Shoes Executive|\u99ac\u5834}}\n*[[K\u014dji Mitsui]] as reporter\n*[[Minoru Chiaki]] as reporter\n*[[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as factory worker\n*[[Kamatari Fujiwara]] as incineration worker\n*[[Masao Shimizu]] as prison director\n*[[Ky\u016b Sazanka]] as creditor\n*[[Akira Nagoya]] as Yamamoto\n*[[K\u014d Nishimura]] as creditor\n*[[Jun Hamamura]] as creditor\n*Ikio Sawamura as trolley man\n*[[Kin Sugai]] as addict\n*Masao Oda as executor\n*Gen Shimizu as chief physician\n*Masahiko Shimizu as {{nihongo|Shinichi Aoki|\u9752\u6728 \u9032\u4e00|Aoki Shinichi}}, the chauffeur's son who is kidnapped at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Production==\n''High and Low'' was filmed at Toho Studios and on location in [[Yokohama]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=213}} The film includes stock music from ''[[The H-Man]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=214}}\n\nKurosawa included cameos by many of his popular stock performers, making its star-studded cast one of the film's best-remembered highlights.<ref>{{cite web|title=20 years with Akira Kurosawa|url=https://books.bunshun.jp/articles/-/1181?page=5|publisher=Bungei Shunju|accessdate=19 May 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film foregrounds the modern infrastructure of the [[Japanese economic miracle|economic miracle years]] and the run-up to the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Tokyo Olympics]], including rapid rail lines and the proliferation of personal automobiles.<ref>Conrad, David A.
