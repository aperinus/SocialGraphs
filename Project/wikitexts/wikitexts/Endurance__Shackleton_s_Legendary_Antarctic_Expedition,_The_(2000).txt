It is based on the book of the same name. [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']] was the name of the ship of Shackleton's expedition. Butler followed it up the next year with another documentary about Shackleton's expedition titled ''[[Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter failing to be the first to reach the [[South Pole]] by only 97 miles in 1909, Shackleton set out to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent via the pole. The expedition met disastrous results when its ship became trapped and ultimately crushed in the ice pack. Shackleton and his 28-man crew endured the long polar winter before ultimately finding rescue following an 800-mile open boat voyage on the [[Weddell Sea]]. Against all odds, the entire crew of ''Endurance'' survived.  [[Frank Hurley|Frank Hurley's]] original film footage was used by Butler, along with interviews of surviving relatives to present the story of Shackleton's expedition.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was well received by critics,<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-endurance/ The Endurance entry] [[rottentomatoes.com]], accessed January 3, 2007.</ref> and was nominated for and won several awards.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264578/awards Endurance awards page] [[IMDb.com]], accessed January 3, 2007.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Survival film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id= 0264578 |title=The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition''\n|list1 =\n{{Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n}}\n{{George Butler}}\n{{Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Endurance}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:British documentary films]]\n[[Category:Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]\n[[Category:Ernest Shackleton]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Antarctica]]\n[[Category:2000 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Butler (filmmaker)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Small]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n\n\n{{hist-documentary-film-stub}}\n{{antarctica-stub}}\n{{SouthGeorgia-stub}}"}]}}}}
