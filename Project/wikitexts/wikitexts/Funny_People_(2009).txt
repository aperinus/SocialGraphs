The film follows a famous comedian who is diagnosed with a terminal disease and tries to fix the relationships in his life while befriending an aspiring comedian.\n\nThe film was released on July 31, 2009. It received generally positive reviews with particular praise for the performances but also criticism for its runtime, and grossed $71 million against its $75 million budget. It was the final film produced by Madison 23, as the studio closed down after its release.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge Simmons is a middle-aged retired [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] turned [[Actor|movie star]]. Despite his [[wealth]], he is disillusioned and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] as most of his recent film work is low-brow and poorly received. Diagnosed with [[acute myeloid leukemia]], he is offered an experimental treatment that has only an 8% success rate. Believing he is about to die, he returns to his roots of stand-up comedy.\n\nIra Wright is an aspiring stand-up comedian in his 20s, sharing an apartment with his two best friends, Mark and Leo. Mark successfully leads his own [[Situation comedy|TV comedy series]]. Leo is a rising comedy star and recurring guest star on Mark's TV show.\n\nGeorge meets Ira at a small comedy club, first hiring him as his assistant, Ira becomes one of his only close relationships. Later he becomes his joke writer, opening for him in big comedy clubs, often meeting with real life comedians who talk about the business.\n\nGeorge reconnects with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Laura, currently married to Clarke. Once his [[physician]] tells him the leukemia is in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], he decides he wants her back. Laura invites George and Ira to her house in [[Marin County]] while her husband is away on business. They spend quality time with her and her two young daughters. George and Laura sneak off to have sex, Clarke returns home and there is an altercation.\n\nLaura faces a choice between her husband Clarke, who she suspects has cheated on her (he later confirms he received a [[Erotic massage#Commercial erotic and sexual massage|happy ending]] at a massage parlor), or George (who also cheated on her many times). Ira is not always on George's side in the love triangle, so when it doesn't go George's way in the end, he fires him, who then calls George out on having learned nothing from his [[near-death experience]].\n\nIra returns to his old food-service job. After some time has passed, George attends Ira's stand-up act and sees that his old assistant has become a talented and competent performer. The next day, George finds Ira at work and they reconnect as friends, telling each other jokes as equals.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Funny People 6807.jpg|thumb|Leslie Mann, Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow in Berlin (2009)]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as George Simmons, a retired comedian turned actor.\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Ira Wright, an aspiring comedian.\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Laura, George's ex-fianc\u00e9e.\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Clarke, Laura's husband.\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Leo Koenig\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Mark Taylor Jackson\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Daisy Danby\n* [[Maude Apatow]] as Mable\n* [[Iris Apatow]] as Ingrid\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Randy Springs\n* [[RZA]] as Chuck\n* [[Torsten Voges]] as Dr. Lars\n* Allan Wasserman as Dr. Stevens\n* [[Wayne Federman]] as Comedy & Magic Manager\n* Mike O'Connell as MySpace Escort\n* [[Nicole Parker]] as Dawn\n* Nydia McFadden as Mandy\n* [[Nicol Paone]] as George's Sister\n* [[George Coe]] as George's Dad\n* [[Bryan Batt]] as George's Agent\n* [[Maggie Siff]] as Rachel\n* [[Tonita Castro]] as Bonita\n \n{{div col end}}\n[[Dave Attell]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Ray Romano]], [[Paul Reiser]], [[Charles Fleischer]], [[George Wallace (American comedian)|George Wallace]], [[Andy Dick]], Rod Man, [[Budd Friedman]], Monty Hoffman, Mark Schiff, [[Orny Adams]], Al Lubel, [[Jerry Minor]], and [[Carol Leifer]] made [[cameo appearance]]s as themselves in the roles of George's fellow comedians,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2008/12/17/stand-up-comedian-cameos-in-judd-apatows-funny-people/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129230406/http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/12/17/stand-up-comedian-cameos-in-judd-apatows-funny-people/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-01-29|title=Stand-Up Comedian Cameos in Judd Apatow's Funny People|publisher=Slashfilm.com|date=2008-12-17|access-date=2009-01-31}}</ref> while comedians [[Tyler Spindel]] and [[Kyle Kinane]] respectively play a college guy with camera and a paparazzo at the medical center.

Apatow filmed their entire performances, although only five to ten minutes of stand-up footage appear in the film. Hill admitted his performance was not well-received because he had never done stand-up before. Additionally, Apatow filmed scenes from Sandler's character's fictional filmography, as well as scenes from Schwartzman's character's fictional television show ''Yo Teach!'', for the film to add realism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/05/07/judd-apatow-wants-you-to-enjoy-the-ride-of-funny-people-for-25-hoursthen-watch-the-super-long-dvd/ |title=Judd Apatow Wants You To 'Enjoy The Ride' Of 'Funny People' For 2.5 Hours...Then Watch The Super-Long DVD |publisher=MTV Movie Blog |date=2009-05-07 |access-date=2009-05-08}}</ref>\n\nApatow used an old video of Sandler, from when the two were roommates, in which Sandler makes prank phone calls, and features a young [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]].\n\n==Marketing==\nThe first [[film poster|teaser poster]]<ref>{{cite web|title=First Film Poster for Funny People|url=http://funnyppl.com/funnypeople-adam-sandler-seth-rogen-leslie-mann|website=funnyppl.com|access-date=24 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204302/http://funnyppl.com/funnypeople-adam-sandler-seth-rogen-leslie-mann|archive-date=24 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> for the film was released November 13, 2008.
