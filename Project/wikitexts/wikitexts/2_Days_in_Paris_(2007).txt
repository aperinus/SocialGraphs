The film also stars [[Adam Goldberg]] and [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]]. It was followed by the 2012 sequel ''[[2 Days in New York]]''.\n\n==Premise==\nMarion is a French-born photographer living in New York City with her [[Neurosis|neurotic]], [[hypochondria]]cal, chain-smoking, heavily tattooed American [[interior design]]er boyfriend Jack. After a markedly unromantic trip to Venice, which was planned to re-ignite the passion in their relationship, they take a night train to Paris to pick up Marion's cat from her parents and decide to stay for two days. Jack is startled to learn Marion has remained in contact with numerous ex-lovers and becomes increasingly uncomfortable due to the language barrier and a multitude of her old flames she keeps meeting. Meanwhile, Marion wrestles with her own insecurities about love, relationships, and her impulsive nature.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Julie Delpy]] as Marion\n*[[Adam Goldberg]] as Jack\n*[[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Lukas\n*{{ill|Marie Pillet|fr|}} as Anna, Marion's mother\n*[[Albert Delpy]] as Jeannot, Marion's father\n*[[Alexia Landeau]] as Rose, Marion's sister\n*[[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]] as Mathieu\n*Alexandre Nahon as Manu\n*[[Vanessa Seward]] as Vanessa\n*Thibault De Lussy as Ga\u00ebl\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Paris. Sites included Gare Du Nord train station, [[Pasteur (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Pasteur]] station in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] and [[Jim Morrison#Grave site|the grave]] of [[Jim Morrison]] in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy, who portray Marion's parents, are Julie Delpy's real-life parents.\nIt was produced by Christophe Mazodier with his company Polaris Film Production & Finance.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe film premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It went into theatrical release in Germany on 17 May 2007 and was shown at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], the Tremblant Film Festival in Canada, the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], and Paris Cin\u00e9ma before going into theatrical release in France on 11 July and the United States on 10 August.\n\n==Critical response==\nReviews were mostly positive. In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] called Julie Delpy \"an original, a woman who refuses to be defined or limited\" and said she \"has made a smart film with an edge to it... What she has done here is avoid all temptation to recycle the usual lovers-in-Paris possibilities, and has created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/REVIEWS/70817010/1023|title=2 Days in Paris|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=10 August 2007|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"is an inside-out version of the much-admired [[Richard Linklater]] films ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' and ''[[Before Sunset]]'', in which Ms. Delpy and [[Ethan Hawke]] portray a French-American pair who meet, part and reunite years later. Where Mr. Linklater's movies were weepies for the kind of educated, upscale young cosmopolites who have a soft spot for romances like ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Ms. Delpy's examination of modern love among the almost young and still restless is bracingly hard-headed.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/08/10/movies/10pari.html|title=Comprenez-Vous Woody Allen Films? Here's a Paris Version|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 August 2007|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn her review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Carina Chocano said, \"At first blush, ''2 Days in Paris'' looks like it's going to be the story of a culture-clashing couple. But slowly and rather slyly, Delpy zeros in on something much more subtle and complex. What interests her are not the superficial differences between people from different countries... but the way in which the distances between people, genders and cultures (the very distances we rely on to grant us the perspective needed to see how completely insane other people, genders, cultures really are) seem to shift constantly according to circumstances.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Carina | last = Chocano | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-paris10aug10,0,4494419.story | title = Movie Review: '2 Days in Paris' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 10 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090505081618/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-paris10aug10%2C0%2C4494419.story | archive-date = 5 May 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nJulie Delpy was nominated for the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Writing]], the [[European Film Awards|European Film Awards Audience Award for Best Film]], and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Film]]. The film won the Coup de C\u0153ur Award from the Mons International Festival of Love Films. It also won the [[Prix Jacques Pr\u00e9vert du Sc\u00e9nario]] for Best Original Screenplay in 2008.\n\n==Sequel==\nIn February 2010, it was announced a [[sequel]] titled ''[[2 Days in New York]]'' was in production. Actress/director Delpy re-teamed with Polaris Film to produce the \"atypical sequel.\" She directed the sequel in Manhattan in October and reprised her role as Marion, a Frenchwoman who now finds herself in New York with her child and a new guy, having broken up with her ''2 Days in Paris'' lover (and the father of her child) who was played by Goldberg.\n\n\"It's about the difficulty of relationships but also about the main character's evolution in general. It's a very modern story about the complexities of being a woman and not being completely consumed by your partner,\" Delpy explained. Comedian [[Chris Rock]] confirmed on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on 8 November 2010 that he was set to play the \"new guy\" in the film. Other members of the Paris cast, including Delpy's real father Albert, returned to their same roles for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2010/02/13/julie-delpy-directing-2-days-in-new-york-follow-up-to-paris/|title=Julie Delpy Directing '2 Days in New York' Follow-Up to 'Paris'|last=Billington|first=Alex|date=13 February 2010|website=firstshowing.net|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160121173540/http://www.firstshowing.net/2010/julie-delpy-directing-2-days-in-new-york-follow-up-to-paris/ | archive-date = 2016-01-21 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0841044|2 Days in Paris}}\n* {{tcmdb title|661468|2 Days in Paris}}\n* {{mojo title|2daysinparis|2 Days in Paris}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|two_days_in_paris|2 Days in Paris}}\n* {{metacritic film|title=2 Days in Paris}}\n\n{{Julie Delpy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2 Days in Paris}}\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:German romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:French independent films]]\n[[Category:German independent films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Julie Delpy]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Julie Delpy]]\n[[Category:2007 independent films]]\n[[Category:2007 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
