It is the sequel to ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'' (2011) and is the fifth installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Rebecca Ferguson]], [[Sean Harris]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. In ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation'', [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) and his team are on the run from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] following the dissolution of the [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) and must go to war with the Syndicate, an international [[black ops]] terrorist organization composed of rogue government agents from all over the world.\n\nMcQuarrie, who completed uncredited rewrites for ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol'', was announced as the director of ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation'' in August 2013. The returns of Cruise, Renner, Pegg, and Rhames were confirmed by July 2014 while the screenplay was also developed by Pearce and [[Will Staples]]; it was ultimately solely credited to McQuarrie. Ferguson, Harris, and Baldwin rounded out the cast that October. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2014 and lasted until March 2015, with filming locations including [[Vienna]], [[Casablanca]], [[London]], and at [[Leavesden Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. The film's official title was revealed in March 2015.\n\nOriginally scheduled for worldwide release on [[Christmas|December 25]], 2015, ''Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation'' premiered at the [[Vienna State Opera]] on July 23, 2015, was theatrically released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] a week later. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Cruise's), screenplay, and McQuarrie's direction. It grossed $683 million worldwide, becoming the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the then-second-highest grossing film in the franchise. The  sequel, ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout]]'', was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nAfter preventing a military cargo plane from transporting nerve gas sold to terrorists, [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] agent [[Ethan Hunt]] is determined to prove the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of rogue [[field operative]]s for various different [[intelligence agencies]] the [[CIA]] does not believe exists. Hunt is captured by the Syndicate at a [[record shop]] in [[London]]. In [[Washington D.C.]], the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] Alan Hunley convinces the [[United States congressional committee|Senate committee]] to dissolve and assimilate the IMF, currently without a secretary in charge, into the CIA due to its [[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol|destructive methods and other misconduct]], Hunt escapes a torture chamber led by Syndicate member Janik \"Bone Doctor\" Vinter with the help of disavowed [[MI6]] agent and now Syndicate operative Ilsa Faust. Without IMF support, Hunt follows his only lead: a blond man in glasses later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane.\n\nSix months later, Hunt is currently a fugitive living in [[Paris]], having to lure a CIA SAD team to a decoy safe house in [[Havana]]. At the [[Vienna State Opera]], the Syndicate kills the [[Chancellor of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] despite efforts to prevent it from Hunt's former colleague Benji Dunn. Faust willingly drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. Dunn learns the Syndicate is working against \"the old [[world order]]\" by committing several terrorist acts, but stays with Hunt instead of reporting to the CIA. Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]]. IMF agent William Brandt contacts [[Luther Stickell]] to find Hunt before the CIA does.\n\nStickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to [[Casablanca]], where the trio break into and acquire a secret Syndicate file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data and goes to [[London]] to use it, but it is discreetly wiped by MI6 [[Agent handling|handler]] Atlee. Meanwhile, Hunt learns that the data is an encrypted British government virtual [[Red box (government)|red box]] that requires the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s biometrics to unlock it. They reach London to confront Faust, where Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to [[blackmail]] Hunt into decrypting and delivering the data to them. Despite Brandt's protests, Hunt agrees to do so.\n\nAs part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee meet the PM in [[Oxford]], who confirms that the Syndicate was a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, which the PM rejected. Atlee then reveals himself as Hunt in a mask and secures the PM's biometrics, allowing Stickell to decrypt the file. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. Upon discovering the file contains access to [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]2.4 billion in various bank accounts, serving as the Syndicate's would-be operating budget, Hunt destroys the data.\n\nAt his meeting with Lane outside the [[Tower of London]], Hunt tells Lane he has memorized the data and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Hunt and Faust are chased through the Tower of London complex by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Lane is gassed unconscious in a glass cell and taken into custody. Having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, Hunley later returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and covers for Hunt and his team, convincing the committee to restore the IMF. After the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], an agent of the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) and protagonist of the film.\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as William Brandt, an IMF Agent and intelligence analyst transferred to the CIA after the IMF was disbanded. \n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent who is transferred to the CIA's cyber operations division after the IMF was disbanded.\n* [[Rebecca Ferguson]] as Ilsa Faust, a disavowed [[MI6]] Agent undercover in the Syndicate who works with Ethan to retrieve the 'ledger' at Morocco.\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as [[Luther Stickell]], an IMF Agent and computer hacker, who retired after  the IMF was disbanded.
