An adaptation of [[Edith Wharton]]'s 1905 novel ''[[The House of Mirth]]'', the film stars [[Gillian Anderson]].  It is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, Germany, and United States.\n\n==Plot==\nLily Bart is a beautiful socialite accustomed to comfort and luxury. Along with her younger cousin, Grace Stepney, she lives with her wealthy aunt, Julia Peniston.\n\nLily genuinely admires lawyer Lawrence Selden, but he is too poor for her to seriously consider marrying. Her choices are limited to coarse, vulgar Simon Rosedale, a rising financier, and wealthy but dull Percy Gryce. Lily\u2019s friend Judy Trenor urges her to pursue Gryce. Lily, however, cannot help preferring Selden, and during a country weekend, they take a long walk and share an innocent kiss. Gryce, with whom Lily has broken two appointments, leaves abruptly. Fearful for her future, a dejected Lily pours out her troubles to Judy's husband, Gus Trenor. He leads her to believe he will help her earn money through investment. Later, Lily purchases scandalous letters written by Bertha Dorset revealing that Selden was her lover. Lily is hurt, but keeps the letters secret.\n\nAt a wedding, Lily receives a $5,000 check from Gus Trenor, who claims to have reinvested another $4,000. Later, he invites Lily to the opera, where she is seen by her disapproving aunt and Lawrence Selden as she sits with Trenor and Rosedale. Trenor tricks her into leaving the opera and accompanying him to his home, where he tries to kiss her, claiming that Lily is not playing a fair game when she accepts his money but refuses him her attentions. When Lily arrives home, her aunt refuses to loan her the money to repay the $9000 she received from Trenor. Lily confides in Grace, asking if she should turn to Selden for his understanding, but Grace advises against it; she loves Lawrence and is jealous of Lily. Lily had arranged a later appointment with Selden while at the wedding, and she counts on his love for her to overcome her foolish mistakes.\n\nWhile Lily is hoping to hear from Selden, Rosedale visits, proposing to her as if suggesting a corporate merger. His wealth could free Lily, yet she politely rejects his flattering but cold blooded proposal. Bertha Dorset invites Lily to the Dorsets' yacht for a European cruise. Lily accepts, desperate to escape the debts, whispers and criticism in New York.\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Mrs. Carry Fisher meets with Selden, who has arrived from London. They are both worried about Lily, travelling on the Dorsets\u2019 yacht. Lily and George Dorset converse on deck while a young man reads French poetry to Bertha. While ashore that evening, Lily and George look for them in vain before returning to the yacht. Next morning, George enters Lily's cabin, accusing her of knowing about Bertha's indiscretions with the young poet. Lily pleads ignorance of Bertha\u2019s behavior but when Bertha returns and Lily confronts her, saying she can no longer divert George\u2019s attention from Bertha\u2019s affair, Bertha turns the tables by accusing Lily of adultery with George, since Lily was alone aboard the yacht with him all night.\n\nBack in New York, the Dorsets are still in marital discord and Aunt Julia has died. Lily receives only a fraction of her vast fortune, the bulk having been left to Cousin Grace. Now homeless and adrift, Lily is invited by Carry Fisher to stay with her and the Gormers for the summer. Carry believes Lily's two possibilities for marriage are George Dorset and Simon Rosedale. George asks Lily for the truth about his wife Bertha's infidelities, but she denies any knowledge of them. In her growing desperation she approaches Simon Rosedale. He has found out about Bertha's letters and advises Lily to use them to force Bertha to restore her social standing. He offers to marry Lily once she and Bertha are reconciled, but Lily refuses.\n\nLily starts working for the social-climbing Mrs. Hatch as her social secretary. Selden tells Lily this hurts her social standing, but she needs the money. They argue and part on bad terms. Lily goes to the pharmacy for Mrs. Hatch's [[laudanum]] sleeping medication, and begins taking it herself. After Mrs. Hatch gets into society, she discovers that Lily's reputation is a liability, so she fires her. Lily gets a job sewing for a milliner, but her growing addiction leads to her being fired for poor work. Lily visits her cousin Grace for a loan but is rejected.\n\nLily almost confronts Bertha Dorset with the letters written to Mr. Selden, but finding that the Dorsets have left town, she goes to Lawrence Selden, telling him she knows she lost his love. When Lawrence isn't looking, she throws the letters in his lit fireplace. Lily goes home and finds her inheritance has at last been delivered. She puts the check in an envelope she addresses to her bank, and writes another for Gus Trenor, resolving the massive debts, and then takes a fatal dose of the laudanum, drifting off to oblivion in her darkened room. Finding the partially-burnt letters in his fireplace and sensing her intentions, Selden rushes to her boarding room. There, at her deathbed, holding her hand, he weeps, declaring his love for her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Gillian Anderson]] as Lily Bart\n*[[Eric Stoltz]] as Lawrence Selden\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Gus Trenor\n*[[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Simon Rosedale\n*[[Laura Linney]] as Bertha Dorset\n*[[Terry Kinney]] as George Dorset\n*[[Eleanor Bron]] as Mrs. Julia Peniston\n*[[Jodhi May]] as Grace Stepney\n*[[Elizabeth McGovern]] as Mrs. Carry Fisher\n*[[Penny Downie]] as Judy Trenor\n*[[Pearce Quigley]] as Percy Gryce\n*[[Lorelei King]] as Mrs. Hatch\n*[[Morag Siller]] as Mary Lee\n*[[Pamela Dwyer]] as Edith Fisher\n}}\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were shot at [[Gosford House]] in [[East Lothian]], Scotland and at [[Manderston]] House in the [[Scottish Borders]].<ref>(2015) [http://www.filmedinburgh.org/filming/filmed_here?fh_PageIndex=9&fh_PageSize=10 Filmed here - 2000,    The House of Mirth, Terence Davies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022821/http://www.filmedinburgh.org/filming/filmed_here?fh_PageIndex=9&fh_PageSize=10 |date=18 February 2015 }} Film Edinburgh, Retrieved 20 February 2015</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The House of Mirth'' premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on 23 September 2000.
