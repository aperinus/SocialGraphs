The film was released on March 13, 2009. It marks the final on-screen film appearance of [[Hugh Hefner]] prior to his death in 2017. It is also the first of only two films directed by Trevor Moore prior to his death in 2021, the second being \"The Civil War On Drugs\" which was aired in segments in the final season of ''The Whitest Kids U' Know'' in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nTucker has been a huge fan of the [[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy franchise]] since finding his friend Eugene's older brother's magazines when he was eight. Eugene and his girlfriend Cindi Whitehall are public speakers on the subject of abstinence. They plan to have sex at an after [[prom]] party that Tucker has invited them to. At the party, Eugene is nervous and Tucker gives him several shots of hard alcohol. Eugene falls down the steps into the basement, and is in a [[coma]] for four years.\n\nTucker wakes Eugene from the coma with a baseball bat, and they discover that Cindi has become the newest Playboy centerfold. Tucker devises a plan to go cross country to the Playboy Mansion and crash Playboy's annual Birthday bash in order to reunite Eugene with his old girlfriend.\n\nIn Chicago, they meet up with their old friend, who has become a famous rapper with the MC name of Horsedick dot MPEG. They all hop on board his party bus and begin to trek across the country towards the Playboy Mansion. After an argument between Horsedick and Eugene, Tucker and Eugene are both thrown out of the bus in the middle of nowhere, and left to walk the rest of the way. Just as it seems like all hope is lost, a car pulls up with two lesbian women. They make a deal where the boys will drive while the girls are in the back with each other having sex.\n\nThey make it to the Mansion only to be stopped by bouncers at the door. Eugene is suspected of being a stalker and is taken into a secure holding area, but not before being spotted by Cindi. Meanwhile, Tucker runs into [[Hugh Hefner]]. Hugh and Tucker have a discussion about Tucker's issues, telling Tucker about the first woman he ever fell in love with. Hefner tells Tucker that \"there is a bunny in every woman\", and that if Tucker can only see the \"bunny\" in those women, that he's on to something.\n\nBack in the holding area, Cindi comes in to see Eugene. Eugene claims she left him behind and didn't care about him, but Cindi tells Eugene that the money she made modeling and being a Playboy Bunny was sent to help pay for Eugene's hospital bills after his neglectful father wanted to permanently move him into a low-grade hospital. Tucker apologizes and Candace decides to give him another chance.\n\nEugene runs into Horsedick dot MPEG, who promised to \"rip Eugene's face off\". After Cindi reveals that Horsedick was born without genitals, his right-hand man realizes that he's never seen MPEG in action with a woman. At that moment, his crew pulls down his pants, showing nothing but two straws where his genitals should be. Horsedick leaves ashamed, and after Eugene and Cindi make up, Hefner lets everyone back in.  Eugene and Tucker find themselves in the Mansion's kitchen, and Eugene tells Tucker that Cindi is waiting upstairs for him.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Zach Cregger]] as Eugene Pratt\n* [[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]] as Tucker Cleigh\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Phil aka \"Horsedick Dot MPEG\"<!-- Official website lists it as this, not .mpeg or .MPEG -->\n* [[Raquel Alessi]] as Cindi Whitehall\n* [[Molly Stanton]] as Candace\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Doctor\n* [[Hugh Hefner]] as Himself\n* [[Sara Jean Underwood]] as Herself\n* [[Betsy Rue]] as Strawberrius\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as Nurse Juanita\n* [[Eve Mauro]] as Vonka\n* [[Tanjareen Martin]] as Crystal\n* [[Alex Donnelley]] as Mrs. Whitehall\n* [[Jen Taylor]] as Customs Official\n* [[Anthony Jeselnik]] as Director\n\n==Production==\nTrevor Moore and Zach Cregger were offered the script of ''Miss March'' by Fox, and although not initially interested the idea held some appeal and they took it on as a writing exercise and made it their own. They developed the project intentionally without the involvement of ''Playboy''.<ref name=\"cinemablend\" />\n\n[[Robert Wagner]] was originally cast as Hugh Hefner and according to Moore and Cregger, he did a great job, but audiences at test screenings did not react positively; audiences already familiar with Hefner from the television series ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' did not connect with Wagner.<ref name=\"ign\" /> \"Tails between their legs,\" Moore and Cregger took the film to Playboy.

Despite that, he is still relatively critical of the final product. Moore on the other hand, stood by the movie, comparing it to  their sketch group ''[[The Whitest Kids U' Know]]'' TV series \"some parts are funny, some parts aren't.\" The directors still had a sense of humor about the poor response as they would read the poor reviews and sarcastically remark about the film's quality on livestream.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1151922}}\n* {{amg title|455249}}\n* {{mojo title|missmarch}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|10010760_miss_march}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about virginity]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:American comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:Teen sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about pornography]]\n[[Category:Films about Playboy]]\n[[Category:Films about proms]]\n[[Category:2009 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
