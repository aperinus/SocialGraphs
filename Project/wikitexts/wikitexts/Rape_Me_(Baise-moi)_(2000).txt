It is based on the novel by Despentes, first published in 1993. The film received intense media coverage because of its graphic mix of violence and explicit sex scenes. Consequently, it is sometimes considered an example of the \"[[New French Extremity]].\"\n\nAs a [[French language|French]] noun, ''un baiser'' means \"a [[kiss]],\" but as a verb, ''baiser'' means \"to [[fuck]],\" so ''Baise-moi'' ({{IPA-fr|b\u025bz.mwa|pron}}) means simply \"Fuck me.\" In some markets the film has been screened as \"[[Rape]] me,\" but the French for \"rape me\" is \"viole-moi.\" In a 2002 interview ''Rape Me'' was rejected by the directors.\n\nIn 2000, The [[Film Censorship Board of Malaysia]] banned the film outright because of \"very high-impact violence and sexual content throughout.\" Later that same year, the film was banned in [[Singapore]] owing to \"depictions of sexual violence [that] may cause controversy.\" In [[Australia]], the film was allowed to be shown at cinemas with an R18+ (adults only) rating. Then in 2002, the film was pulled from cinemas and television and after that, banned outright. The film is still banned there because of its \"harmful, explicit sexually violent content,\" and was re-banned in 2013.<ref name=\"RC\">{{cite web|url=http://refused-classification.com/censorship/films/baise-moi-2000.html|title=Baise-moi (2000)|publisher=Refused-Classification.com|access-date=27 August 2013}}</ref> However, an edited R18+ version was screened on 23 August 2013 on the [[World Movies]] channel of the Australian state broadcaster SBS, as part of the World Movies \"Films That Shocked The World\" season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/07/banned-movie-baise-moi-to-air-on-world-movies-channel.html |title=Banned movie Baise-moi to air on World Movies channel |publisher=TV Tonight |date=2013-07-25 |access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> and it is currently available via online streaming service [[Stan (company)|Stan]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Baise-moi'' tells the story of Nadine and Manu who go on a violent spree against a society in which they feel marginalized. Nadine is a part-time sex worker, and Manu a slacker who does anything\u2014including occasional porn film acting\u2014to get by in her small town in southern France.\n\nOne day, Manu and her friend, a [[drug addict]], are accosted in the park by three men, who take them to a garage and [[Gang raped|gang-rape]] them. While her friend struggles, screams, and fights against the rapists, Manu lies still with a detached look, which troubles the man raping her, who soon gives up. When her friend asks Manu how she could act so detached, she replies that she \"can't prevent anyone from penetrating her pussy\", so she didn't leave anything precious in there. Manu then returns to her brother's house, and does not tell him what has happened, but noticing bruises on her neck, he realizes. He gets out a gun and asks Manu who was responsible, but when she refuses to tell him, he calls her a \"slut\" and implies that she actually enjoyed being raped. In response, picking up the discarded pistol, Manu shoots him in the head.\n\nMeanwhile, Nadine returns home and has an argument with her roommate, whom she strangles and kills, before leaving with their rent money. Nadine suffers another emotional setback when she meets her best friend, a drug dealer, in another town, but he is shot and killed while out obtaining drugs with a prescription she forged for him.\n\nLater that night, having missed the last train, Nadine meets Manu at the railway station. Manu says she has a car, if Nadine will drive for her. They soon realize that they share common feelings of anger, and embark on a violent and sexually charged road trip together.\n\nIn need of money, the girls hold up a shop and also kill a woman at a cash machine. In a stolen car, they are pulled over for a random check by police, whom they kill. Another woman, who was also being checked and saw the murders, flees with them. The women stay over at their new friend's house, whose brother provides the address and details of an architect with whom he has had trouble. The women trick their way into the architect's house and kill him. Finally, after this spree of murder and sexual activity, the two women enter a swingers' club. One of the patrons makes a racist comment to Manu. The women kill most of the patrons there, and use a gun to anally penetrate the racist man, finally shooting him. The pair discuss what they have done, and agree that it has all been pointless because nothing has changed in them.\n\nDuring their spree, the duo's crimes are reported by the press, and become a point of fascination for the entire country, with some people actually supporting them, and others afraid of them. When Manu enters a roadside tire shop to get some coffee, she is shot by the shop owner, who is then shot by Nadine outside. Nadine takes Manu's body to a forest and burns it, before driving to a beach. With tears in her eyes, Nadine puts the gun to her head, intending to commit suicide, but gets arrested by the police before she can do so.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karen Lancaume]] (credited as Karen Bach) as Nadine\n* [[Raffa\u00ebla Anderson]] as Manu\n* C\u00e9line Beugnot as blonde girl in billiard\n* Adama Niane as man in billiard\n* Marc Barrow as hotel clerk\n* Delphine McCarty as roommate\n* Patrick Eudeline as Francis\n* [[Ian Scott (actor)|Ian Scott]] as rapist #1\n* Philippe Houillez as rapist #2\n* Steven Jhonsson as rapist #3\n* Titof as \"cute guy\"\n* Ouassini Embarek as Radouane\n* Sebastian Barrio as guy in swinging club\n* [[Jean-Louis Costes]] as guy in swinging club\n\n==Production==\nThe film was filmed on location between October and December 1999 in [[Biarritz]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lyon]], and [[Marseille]]. It was shot on [[digital video]] without artificial lighting. This low budget method of filming divided critics\u2014some said it gave the film an amateurish look. Lou Lumenick, reviewing the film in the ''[[New York Post]]'', went further and said it \"looked like hell\". Others, such as James Travers writing for filmsdefrance.com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsdefrance.com |title=Films de France |publisher=Films de France |access-date=25 January 2010<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> said the filming method added something to the film. Travers wrote \"the film's 'rough and ready' feel helps to strengthen its artistic vision and draws out the messages which it is trying to get across, without distracting its audience with overly choreographed 'shock scenes'.\"\n\n==Release==\nThe film, co-directed by [[Coralie Trinh Thi]] who had previously worked as a [[Pornographic film actor|pornographic actress]],<ref name=\"lib\u00e9ration\">[http://next.liberation.fr/culture/2000/05/18/marche-du-film-virginie-despentes-adapte-baise-moi-son-best-seller-de-1995-resultat-un-porno-en-gicl_326400 MARCH\u00c9 DU FILM.

''[[Le Monde]]'', for instance, called it a \"sick film\".

And as one of the amoral avengers, Raffaela Anderson has true star quality \u2013 part seraph, all slut.\" The co-directors rejected the pornography charge: Trinh Thi said in an interview with the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' that \"This movie is not for masturbation, [thus it] is not porn.\" Despentes agreed, saying their film \"was not erotic\".\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = Lead actresses Karen Bach (AKA [[Karen Lancaume]]) and [[Raffa\u00ebla Anderson]] (AKA Rapha\u00eblla), both pictured at the time of their porn careers.\n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =Karen Lancaume Le Principe de plaisir cropped.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 * 1200 / 1025) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Raffaela Anderson Exhibition 99 cropped.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 * 1200 / 1060) round 0}}\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n}}\nIn its home country, the film was initially released with a 16 rating, given by a ministerial commission. The rating caused outrage, particularly amongst members of the right-wing ''Promouvoir'' religious group, which is strongly associated with the [[Mouvement National R\u00e9publicain]]. Some groups litigated against the classification decision, arguing that the film should be X-rated given its high content of realistic sex and extreme violence, both of which are grounds for X classification in France; the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] ruled its classification illegal, removing it from the theater circuit. It was the first film to be banned in France for 28 years. The Conseil later re-classified the film with an X certificate, a category usually reserved for pornographic movies. [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister for Culture]] [[Catherine Tasca]] ended the debate by re-introducing an 18 certificate without the X classification, allowing the film to be re-released in mainstream theatres.\n\nIn Australia, the film was initially passed for viewing at the highest possible R18 rating in a 6\u20135 vote by the country's Classification Board in October 2001. However the Attorney-General invoked his powers under the 1995 Classification Act to have the board's decision reviewed. The Classification Review Board (a separate entity to the Classification Board) ruled in May 2002 that the film contains \"explicit, offensive and graphic depictions of sexual violence, assault and violence with an impact that is very high\" and \"dangerous to the community,\" resulting in the film being banned with a \"Refused Classification\" rating. It was later revealed that 50,000 people had seen the film before the ban, but according to Des Clark, director of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, just \"one or two\" of those had complained about the film. Most complainants, he explained, had not seen the film. An appeal of the review board's verdict failed. Despite an edited screening of the film airing on the pay [[World Movies]] channel later the same month, the film was re-banned in August 2013.<ref name=\"RC\"/> The film is currently available for screening via the online streaming service [[Stan (company)|Stan]] since 15 October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brandy|first=Daniella|date=2018-09-27|title=Here's what's new on Stan, Netflix Australia and Foxtel in October|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/hwhats-new-on-stan-netflix-australia-foxtel-october-2018-9|access-date=2020-06-24|website=Business Insider Australia|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Cabral|first=Jeremy|date=2015-03-23|title=List of movies on Stan (Updated daily) {{!}} Finder|url=https://www.finder.com.au/stan-movies|access-date=2020-06-24|website=finder.com.au|language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], the film was banned in Ontario, initially because it was deemed too pornographic. The producers asked for a pornographic rating, only for it to be banned because there was too much violence for a pornographic film. A second review in 2001 passed the film with an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/ofrb/OfrbWelcomeAction.do?detailParameter=2000016020|title=BAISE-MOI|publisher=Ontario Film Review Board|access-date=7 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228054229/http://www.ofrb.gov.on.ca/ofrb/OfrbWelcomeAction.do?detailParameter=2000016020|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In [[Quebec]], the film was considered to be a moderate success for an independent release, taking in approximately $250,000 CAD in the first two months of its run.

It screened only at a small number of cinemas (almost all of them in arthouse cinemas in the major cities). The film took just $70,000 in receipts from its American release and there was a marked lack of controversy as compared to other countries.\n\nThe film also performed quite poorly in Germany. Although it was released in its unedited version, it didn't cause much of a controversy in the media. It received an R18 rating in cinemas in New Zealand, and was banned from video release there, following an injunction filed by the [[Society for the Promotion of Community Standards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0312/S00070.htm |title=Appeal on French Sex-Violence Film \u2013 ''Baise-Moi'' |publisher=Scoop |date=11 December 2003 |access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> The film was refused classification in Ireland, essentially preventing its screening in mainstream cinemas, although it was shown in arthouse club cinemas which screen unclassified films.\n\nTwo minutes and 35 seconds of cuts were required before the film received a certificate in [[Hong Kong]].

An uncut version was shown in both cinemas and on TV.<ref>[http://www.elonet.fi/title/ekksue/tarkastus ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613115931/http://www.elonet.fi/title/ekksue/tarkastus |date=13 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the film's release in [[Bulgaria]] was otherwise uncontroversial, a program conducted an experiment in which two 14-year-olds were sent to buy tickets for it. The teenagers successfully made the purchase and even entered the cinema, but left after the opening credits. Rather than discussing the film itself, the program focused on the lack of control cinema owners and staff \u2013 as well as the authorities \u2013 exercised over minors visiting adult films in the country. The cinema in question later pulled the film off its schedule, following the report's first airing.\n\nIn [[Mexico]], the film was shown uncut in mainstream theaters, with a \"C\" (18+) rating, with a warning because of its sexual and violent content, but it did not attract much controversy in the media. It was also aired several times uncut on cable television.\n\n==Reception==\n''Baise-moi'' received generally negative reviews.
