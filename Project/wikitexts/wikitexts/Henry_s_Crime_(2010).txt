The film follows Henry (Reeves), who goes to jail for a bank robbery he did not commit. Once released, he plans to rob the same bank with his former cellmate Max (Caan). The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2010, and was given a limited release in the United States on April 8, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/henrys-crime-trailer/80892/|title=Trailer for HENRY's CRIME Starring Keanu Reeves|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|date=March 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWorking the night shift as a toll collector on a lonely stretch of highway in [[Buffalo, New York]], Henry is a man seemingly without ambition, dreams or purpose; a man sleepwalking his way through life. His wife Debbie is not happy with the situation.\n\nOne morning Eddie, a friend, drops by to ask Henry to play in a baseball game, as one of the others is ill, and Henry agrees to. As they drive to the game in Henry's car, Eddie asks Henry to stop at an ATM. But Eddie, and two acquaintances also in the car, instead rob the [[Buffalo Savings Bank]], and Henry is arrested as an accomplice.\n\nRather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There his cellmate is the irrepressible Max, a conman who has grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his \"idyllic\" life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry's mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Debbie decides to divorce him, and she marries Joe, one of the men who carried out the robbery.\n\nUpon his release eighteen months later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done his time, he decides he might as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger's tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole \u2013 to help stage a robbery of the bank.\n\nMax encourages Henry to become an actor in the theater's current production of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s 1904 play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', to assist Max, \"volunteering\" to work in the theater, in getting access to the tunnel. Meanwhile, Henry finds himself falling for the production's mercurial leading lady, Julie.\n\nDebbie's husband Joe is recruited to help clearing the tunnel of mud; he informs Eddie, who insists on participating too. Frank, a guard at the bank forced into retirement, helps by informing the robbers when there is a lot of money in the vault. During the actual robbery, Eddie uses a gun to try to take all the money himself, but is overpowered by Max and is left behind in the vault. As the three make their escape, Henry demands Joe stop the car. Henry wishes Max well, and he then returns to Julie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Henry Torne\n* [[James Caan]] as Max Saltzman\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Julie Ivanova\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Debbie Torne\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Eddie Vibes\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Darek Millodragovic\n* [[Bill Duke]] as Frank\n* [[Danny Hoch]] as Joe\n* [[Currie Graham]] as Simon\n* [[David Costabile]] as Arnold{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Malcolm Venville]] directed the film from a screenplay written by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and David N.
