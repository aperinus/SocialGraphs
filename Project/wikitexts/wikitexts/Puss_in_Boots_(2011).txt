It is directed by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]]\u2014who also directed ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007)\u2014and written by [[Tom Wheeler (writer)|Tom Wheeler]], from a story by [[Brian Lynch (writer)|Brian Lynch]], [[William Davies (screenwriter)|Will Davies]] and Wheeler. It stars [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Amy Sedaris]] and [[Constance Marie]].\n\nA spin-off of the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]], and rather than an adaptation of [[Puss in Boots|the Puss in Boots fairytale]], the film follows the [[origin story]] of [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] on his adventures years before the events of ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004). Accompanied by his friends, [[Humpty Dumpty]] and Kitty Softpaws, Puss is pitted against Jack and Jill, two murderous outlaws in ownership of legendary magical beans that lead to a great fortune.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on October 28, 2011 in 2D, [[Digital 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] formats. ''Puss in Boots'' received positive reviews from critics and grossed $555 million at the box office. At the [[84th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]. A television series spin-off from the film titled ''[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]]'' premiered on [[Netflix]] in January 2015 and concluded in January 2018 after [[List of The Adventures of Puss in Boots episodes|six seasons]], while a sequel, titled ''[[Puss in Boots: The Last Wish]]'', is set to be released on December 21, 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] is a Spanish-speaking, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] cat named for his signature pair of boots. A fugitive on the run from the law, Puss is seeking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the murderous outlaw couple [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]] have the magic beans he has long sought, which can lead him to a giant's castle known by legend to contain valuable [[The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs|golden goose eggs]]. When Puss attempts to steal the beans at their hideout, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts. She was hired to steal them as well by [[Humpty Dumpty|Humpty Alexander Dumpty]], a talking egg and long-estranged childhood friend of Puss from the orphanage where they both were raised. Puss tells Kitty his [[origin story]] and how he felt betrayed by Humpty, who tricked Puss into committing a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo. Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs, although Puss only accepts so he can pay the debt he owns to San Ricardo because of Humpty.\n\nPuss and Kitty's relationship turns romantic and, despite Puss' initial grudge against Humpty, he slowly warms up to him, as the trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and plants them in the desert. They ride the beanstalk into the clouds and enter the giant's castle, where Humpty reveals to Puss that the giant died a long time ago. They must still avoid the Great Terror who guards the golden eggs. They soon realize the golden eggs are too heavy, and decide to steal the goose's gosling after witnessing it lay miniature golden eggs. They manage to escape the castle and cut down the beanstalk. After celebrating, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, and Puss is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen he wakes, Puss assumes Humpty and Kitty were kidnapped and tracks Jack and Jill's wagon back to San Ricardo. There, he learns that the kidnapping was staged. Jack, Jill, and Kitty are all working for Humpty, who is seeking revenge against Puss for abandoning him during the failed heist all those years ago. Puss is surrounded by the town's militia and turns himself in following pleas from his adoptive mother Imelda. As Puss is hauled away to prison, Humpty is celebrated as a hero for bringing the wealth of the golden eggs to the townspeople.\n\nPuss meets Andy \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]]\" Beanstalk in prison. Jack reveals that Humpty stole the beans from him when they shared a cell years ago, and warns Puss that the Great Terror is the Golden-Egg Goose herself, a gigantic bird who will stop at nothing to rescue her baby. Puss realizes that luring the Great Terror was Humpty's intention all along, hoping to destroy the town in revenge for his imprisonment and flee with the gosling in the chaos. Kitty frees Puss from prison and apologizes, revealing her feelings for him. He locates Humpty in time and convinces him to do the right thing: redeem himself by helping save the town from destruction. Using the gosling as bait, Puss and Humpty are able to lure the Great Terror away from town. With Kitty's help, they also thwart Jack and Jill's attempt to steal the gosling during the chase. As they reach the outskirts of town, Humpty and the gosling are knocked off a collapsing bridge but manage to hang onto a rope that Puss grabs. When it becomes evident that Puss cannot save them both, Humpty sacrifices himself by letting go. After a fatal impact, Puss discovers that Humpty was a large golden egg underneath his shell. The Great Terror is reunited with her gosling, and she takes Humpty's golden egg remains back to the giant's castle.\n\nDespite saving the town and being hailed a hero by the townspeople, Puss is still a fugitive in the eyes of the militia. He reunites with Imelda, who expresses her pride and love for Puss before he flees with Kitty, who playfully steals his boots and runs off. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, Humpty's spirit is seen, in his normal form wearing a golden egg costume, dancing on the mother's back with the golden goose, and Puss and Kitty finally share a kiss.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Shrek and Puss in Boots characters}}\n[[File:Chat pott\u00e9 3.jpg|thumb|[[Salma Hayek]], [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Puss in

film)|The Hobbit]]'', del Toro was invited by the crew to watch an early screening of the film, half animated and half [[storyboard]]ed, which del Toro loved and asked them if he could be somehow involved in the production.<ref name=\"Animated Views\" /> Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: \"We worked out a system for him to come in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone \u2013 our emergency phone \u2013 and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school\". Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. \"Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of [[Humpty Dumpty]]. He suggested we push that further, make him more like [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]\".<ref name=\"DeadlineOscars\">{{cite web |first=Cari |last=Lynn |url=https://deadline.com/2012/02/oscars-puss-in-boots-chris-miller-233251/ |title=OSCARS: Puss In Boots -- Chris Miller |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 19, 2012 |access-date=April 25, 2022 |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220112842/http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/oscars-puss-in-boots-chris-miller/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty \"an ingenious freak of nature\" who builds contraptions such as a flying machine.<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204346104576639502674772230 |title=An Odd Couple and a Well-Shod Cat |last=Dodes |first=Rachel |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 21, 2011 |access-date=April 25, 2022|archive-date=March 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314022943/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204346104576639502674772230 |url-status=live }}</ref> Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss \u2013 an unconventional conclusion for a family film.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as \"an amalgam of Spain and Mexico\".<ref name=\"WSJ\" />\n\nDuring the film's production, the filmmakers struggled for a long time about including the Giant from ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', an English [[fairy tale]] from which the magic beans and the castle in the clouds were borrowed from. As the filmmakers had already figured out the Giant's world, the Giant itself was challenging for them. They wanted to depict him faithfully like the classic fairy tale legend giant, but despite how hard they tried to incorporate him into the story, his presence turned out to be predictable. In the end, it was decided to have the Giant killed off offscreen in order to subvert fairy tales expectations.<ref name=\"Animated Views\" />\n\n[[Antonio Banderas]] reprised his role as Puss in Boots from the ''Shrek'' films. According to Miller, the crew wanted to cast [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Amy Sedaris]] and [[Salma Hayek]] early on during production. As Humpty Dumpty was Galifianakis' first [[Voice-over|voiceover]] role, he was allowed to improvise by the filmmakers. Similarly, Thornton enjoyed the experience of voicing [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack]] as he was looking to challenge himself with a role out of his comfort zone. Sedaris, with whom Miller had worked before, improvised most of her dialogue as [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jill]], giving almost fifty different versions of her scripted lines.<ref name=\"Animated Views\" /> Except for Puss, the film features new characters. Citing the co-writer, [[David H. Steinberg]], \"It doesn't overlap with ''[[Shrek]]'' at all. Partly that was done to tell an original Puss story, but partly because we didn't know what ''Shrek 4'' were going to do with the characters and we couldn't write conflicting storylines.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=\"Caffeinated\" Clint |url=http://www.moviehole.net/200919424-exclusive-puss-in-boots-scribe-talks |title=Exclusive : Puss in Boots scribe talks |work=Moviehole.net |date=June 8, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2010 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111114616/http://www.moviehole.net/200919424-exclusive-puss-in-boots-scribe-talks |url-status=live }}</ref> The film was teased in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', when [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] finally shuts the book titled \"Shrek\", and puts it away next to a book titled \"Puss in Boots\".\n\n''Puss in Boots'' is the first DreamWorks Animation film that was partly made in India. A Bangalore studio owned by Technicolor, which had mainly worked on TV specials and DVD bonus material, spent six months animating three major scenes in the film. The outsourcing had financial advantages, with 40% less labor costs than in the US, but the primary reason for outsourcing to India was lack of personnel, due to the studio producing as many as three films a year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title='Puss in Boots' showcases work by India animators for DreamWorks|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-dwa-india-20111029,0,1526743.story|access-date=November 1, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 29, 2011|archive-date=October 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030091507/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-dwa-india-20111029,0,1526743.story|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Anchor|Soundtrack|Score}}\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Puss in Boots\n| type         = Film\n| artist       = [[Henry Jackman]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = October 24, 2011\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length       = 65:51\n| label        = [[Sony Classical]]\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[X-Men: First Class#Music|X-Men: First Class]]\n| prev_year    = 2011\n| next_title   = [[Small Fry (film)|Small Fry]]\n| next_year    = 2011\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/puss-in-boots-mw0002247643|title=Puss in Boots|first=William|last=Ruhlmann|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808134418/https://www.allmusic.com/album/puss-in-boots-mw0002247643|archive-date=August 8, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=November 19, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Henry Jackman]], the composer for ''Puss in Boots'', utilized folk instruments of traditional Latin music.
