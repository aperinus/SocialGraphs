''Bill Cunningham New York'' is distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]] and was released in theaters on March 16, 2011.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\"We all get dressed for Bill\", says ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor [[Anna Wintour]]. The Bill in question is ''[[The New York Times]]'' photographer [[Bill Cunningham (American photographer)|Bill Cunningham]]. For decades, this [[Schwinn]]-riding cultural [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] has been obsessively and inventively chronicling fashion trends and high-society charity soir\u00e9es for the ''Times''{{'}}s Style section in his columns \"On the Street\" and \"Evening Hours\".\n\nFull of [[Upper Manhattan|uptown]] fixtures (such as Wintour, [[Tom Wolfe]], [[Brooke Astor]], [[David Rockefeller]]\u2014who all appear in the film), [[Lower Manhattan|downtown]] eccentrics and everyone in between, Cunningham's enormous body of work documents its time and place as well as individual flair. ''Bill Cunningham New York'' portrays the man at work (on the street and at the office) and at home (a [[Carnegie Hall]] studio).\n\n==Cast==\n* Bill Cunningham\n*[[Editta Sherman]]\n*[[Carmen Dell'Orefice]]\n*[[Annette de la Renta]]\n*[[Anna Wintour]]\n*[[Iris Apfel]]\n*[[Shail Upadhya]]\n*[[Kim Hastreiter]]\n*[[Thelma Golden]]\n*[[Tom Wolfe]]\n*[[Brooke Astor]]\n*[[Mike Wallace]]\n*[[Michael Bloomberg]]\n*[[Catherine Deneuve]]\n*[[Anna Piaggi]]\n*[[Michael Kors]]\n*[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]\n\n==Awards==\n* 2010: Opening Night Film [[New Directors/New Films Festival]]\n* 2010: Won Audience Award for Best Documentary Film at [[Sydney Film Festival]]\n* 2010: Won Best Documentary at [[Nantucket Film Festival]]\n* 2010: Won Best Documentary Audience Award at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]]\n* 2010: Won Best Documentary at [[Abu Dhabi International Film Festival]]\n\n==Release==\n''Bill Cunningham New York'' played at New York City's [[Film Forum]] from March 16 to 29, 2011, before opening in theaters in a limited release around the United States.\n\n==Reviews==\nThe film was critically well-received, garnering a 99% approval rating on movie review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bill_cunningham_new_york_2010/ |title=Bill Cunningham New York Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=May 19, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110503174612/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bill_cunningham_new_york_2010/| archivedate= May 3, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' described ''Bill Cunningham New York'' as a \"Fascinating doc about a photographer surveying the highs and lows of New York society.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/bill-cunningham-new-york-film-165459|title=Bill Cunningham New York: Film Review|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> ''[[New York Magazine]]'' chose ''Bill Cunningham New York'' as one of their Critics' Picks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/movies/bill-cunningham-new-york-fashion-photographer-review.html|title='Bill Cunningham New York,' Fashion Photographer - Review|last=Chocano|first=Carina|date=2011-03-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars, writing \"This movie made me happy every moment I was watching it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110518/REVIEWS/110519969 |title=Bill Cunningham New York |publisher=rogerebert.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> The film received a score of 76 on the aggregate website [[Metacritic]] indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bill-cunningham-new-york/critic-reviews| title = Critic reviews for Bill Cunningham New York - Metacritic| date = March 16, 2012| accessdate = January 3, 2020| publisher = Metacritic.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://billcunninghamnewyork.com/}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|bill_cunningham_new_york_2010|Bill Cunningham New York}}\n* {{IMDb title|1621444|Bill Cunningham New York}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bill Cunningham New York}}\n[[Category:2010 in fashion]]\n[[Category:2010 documentary films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:2010 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about photographers]]\n[[Category:Films about fashion in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
