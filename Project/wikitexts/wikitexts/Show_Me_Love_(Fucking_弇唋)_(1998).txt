Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a [[lesbian]]. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from [[Self-harm|cutting herself]]. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to [[Stockholm]]. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to [[hitchhike]] to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to '[[coming out|out]]' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m]] as Elin Olsson\n* [[Rebecka Liljeberg]] as Agnes Ahlberg\n* Erica Carlson as Jessica Olsson\n* Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\n* Stefan H\u00f6rberg as Markus\n* Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\n* Ralph Carlsson as Agnes's father, Olof\n* Maria Hedborg as Agnes's mother, Karin\n* Axel Widegren as Agnes's little brother, Oskar\n* Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's mother, Birgitta\n\n==Title==\nThe original title of the film, ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l'', refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene Elin shouts in desperation \"''varf\u00f6r m\u00e5ste vi bo i fucking j\u00e4vla kuk-\u00c5m\u00e5l?''\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-\u00c5m\u00e5l?\").<ref name=\"IndieWire\" />\n\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the [[Academy Awards]], though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee.<ref name=\"VarietyOscar\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/swedes-love-oscar-1117488019/ |title= Swedes 'Love' Oscar |last=Edmunds |first=Marlene |date=November 1, 1998 |department=News |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Variety Media, LLC.]] |access-date=April 14, 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/12626126 |title=Gareth Griffiths, An \u00c5m\u00e5l State of Mind, in ''City + Cinema: Essays on the specificity of location in film'', Datutop 29, 2007. |journal=Academia.edu |access-date=May 27, 2015|last1=Griffiths |first1=Gareth }}</ref><ref name=\"71stSubmissions\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html |title=45 Countries Submit Films for Oscar Consideration |date=November 19, 1998 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219094343/http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html |archive-date=February 19, 1999 |url-status=unfit |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref> The Hollywood industry magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' refused to run an advertisement for ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l''.

Since the release, the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title.
