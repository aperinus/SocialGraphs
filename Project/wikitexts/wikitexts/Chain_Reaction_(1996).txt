The plot centers on the invention of a new non-contaminating power source based on hydrogen and the attempts by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] to prevent the spreading of this technology to other countries. The film was released in the United States on August 2, 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working with a team from the [[University of Chicago]] to convert [[hydrogen]] from water into clean energy, [[machinist]] Eddie Kasalivich inadvertently discovers the secret: a sound frequency that perfectly stabilizes their process. As the project team celebrates with a party at the lab,  Dr. Paul Shannon, the leader of the project, and Dr. Alistair Barkley, the project manager, argue because Alistair wants to share the science and Paul thinks the US should keep the news to itself. After the party, project physicist Dr. Lily Sinclair finds her car unable to start, so Eddie gets her home by bus. Back in the lab, Alistair and assistant Dr. Lu Chen are on their computers preparing to upload their discovery to the Internet so they can share the breakthrough with the world, when a band of men enter the lab and attack the pair.\n\nReturning to the lab to get his motorcycle, Eddie hears alarms and runs inside to find Alistair dead with a plastic bag over his head and Chen missing. As the hydrogen reactor has become dangerously unstable, Eddie, unable to shut it down, speeds away on his motorbike as a concealed detonator triggers a massive hydrogen explosion that destroys the lab and surrounding streets.\n\nUpon returning from questioning by the FBI to their homes, Eddie and Lily realize that they are being [[Frameup|framed]], with planted evidence found in both of their houses. The two flee to an observatory belonging to Maggie McDermott, an old friend of Eddie's. They contact Paul, but they are almost caught in the process and narrowly escape. As the pair are evading more police, Paul meets with Lyman Earl Collier at C-Systems Research complex to discuss the current events. It becomes apparent that Lyman and the CIA orchestrated the plot to destroy the lab and frame the pair for it. Despite some disagreement, Paul and Lyman decide to continue the hunt for the pair, a task facilitated when Eddie sends a coded message to Paul arranging a meeting. At their rendezvous, Paul reveals his involvement, but Lyman\u2019s thugs (the ones who murdered Alistair) capture Lily while Eddie barely escapes.\n\nAfter tracing the license plate on the thugs' van, Eddie tracks them to the secret C-Systems Research facility where Paul and Lyman are forcing Lily and Chen who had been kidnapped, to replicate the project. Eddie sneaks in during the night and proceeds to \"fix\" the system.\n\nThe next morning, one of the other scientists discovers the working reactor and everyone celebrates. A suspicious Paul immediately obtains a download of the working data, and secretly gives it to his assistant, Anita, for safekeeping. He then finds Eddie at a computer in the company boardroom, who demands his release in exchange for making the reactor work. Paul agrees but Lyman refuses, believing that the process already works, so Eddie sets the reactor to explode while sending proof of his innocence to the FBI and blueprints of the reactor to \"hopefully a couple thousand\" international scientists. Lyman responds by shooting Chen dead, then locking in Eddie and Lily to die in the explosion.\n\nPaul kills Lyman for overstepping the bounds of the program, leaving the body to be incinerated in the explosion. During his own escape, he deactivates the containment system, allowing Eddie and Lily to escape. They are attacked by Lyman's henchmen (Yusef Reed and Clancy Butler), but escape moments before a [[blast wave]] sweeps through the complex (incinerating both Reed and Butler's corpses).\n\nHaving survived the shockwave, Eddie and Lily are met by FBI agents Ford and Doyle, now convinced of their innocence, who take them to safety. Paul is shown departing the scene via chauffeured limo, and the last scene has him dictating a memo to his secretary Anita, which informs the Director of the CIA that \"...C-System [is] no longer a viable entity.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Eddie Kasalivich. A [[machinist]] working on a team from the [[University of Chicago]].

Thompson Center (Atrium Mall). Additional scenes were shot at [[Yerkes Observatory]] in [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]], on [[Geneva Lake]] in southern Wisconsin, interiors of the U.S. Capitol were shot at the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]], in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], at [[Inland Steel]] (now known as MITTAL Steel) in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], and at a private residence in Barrington Hills, Illinois. Because of the cold [[Great Lakes]] winter and filming taking place during record breaking winter weather, unique challenges were present for the cast and crew. Morgan Freeman noted that \"It was difficult for everyone, particularly for me because I'm tropical,\" he said. \"I don't do cold weather. This is Chicago...in the winter. I was ill and in bed four days at a crack. It was really rough.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18593909.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222171907/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18593909.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2016-02-22 | work=Jet | title=Morgan Freeman stars in 'Chain Reaction': latest movie in the actor's stellar career | year=1996}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Among the extras in the film were then-U.S. Representative (later U.S. Senator) [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-Wis.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://glenndeutsch.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/isthmus-keanu-skulks.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-16 |archive-date=2020-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730144802/https://glenndeutsch.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/isthmus-keanu-skulks.doc |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Chain Reaction'' received negative reviews.

And then all of a sudden I turn into this 24-year-old machinist and I turned to Andrew Davis and I said, 'What happened to the movie I said yes to? What happened to that script? Where did that go?' And he said, 'No, I got something better,' and so I just had to go with it.\u201c<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2001/09/27/Interview-of-the-week-Keanu-Reeves/26201001639984/ | title=Interview of the week: Keanu Reeves }}</ref>\n\n==Scientific accuracy==\n{{see also|List of water fuel inventions}}\nIn one interpretation of the film's plot, a scientific process supposedly extracts hydrogen from water, then burns the hydrogen to generate power, and leaves only water as a residue, essentially a chemical perpetual motion. The movie never clarifies how the hydrogen is extracted from the water, nor how water is still left over. The character Dr. Shannon makes contradictory statements in the combination of ideas mashed together: one time he says this is accomplished with a laser with millions of degrees, another time he says frequencies of sound and [[sonoluminescence]]. In one scene, the movie shows a bubbling container reminiscent of [[cold fusion]] electrolytic cells and another references sustained fusion.  A character in the film claims that a glass of water could power Chicago for weeks, but no clear explanation is ever given as to whether this is by simply burning hydrogen released by highly efficient means or through nuclear processes.  The film's title is also misleading, since \"chain reaction\" is related to [[nuclear fission]], not fusion.<ref name=perkowitz>{{citation |title= Hollywood Science: Movies, Science, and the End of the World |author= Sidney Perkowitz |edition= illustrated |publisher= Columbia University Press |year= 2010 |isbn= 9780231142816 |pages= 113\u2013114 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z32ojpSLZqsC&q=%22chain+reaction%22+%22cold+fusion%22&pg=PA114 }}</ref>\n\nThe film is based around the premise that [[free energy suppression]] is real. The main character is told that his discovery is too disruptive: energy would suddenly be cheap, oil would no longer be necessary, oil companies would go bankrupt, and such sudden economic changes would throw society into chaos.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn1qKG8Oovk  ''Chain Reaction''] on Youtube\n* {{IMDb title|id=0115857|title=Chain Reaction}}\n* {{Amg movie|136487|Chain Reaction}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=1072457-chain_reaction|title=Chain Reaction}}\n* {{mojo title|id=chainreaction|title=Chain Reaction}}\n\n{{Andrew Davis}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chain Reaction (Film)}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s chase films]]\n[[Category:1996 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:3 Arts Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Chicago Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films about kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Films about miscarriage of justice]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear technology]]\n[[Category:Films about scientists]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrew Davis]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films set in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:The Zanuck Company films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
