It follows the adventures of [[Richard B. Riddick]] as he attempts to elude capture after the events depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''. [[Vin Diesel]] reprises his role as Riddick and acts as producer. It is the first and so far only film in the franchise to be given a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] rating. The film received negative reviews and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]] despite being the highest grossing film in the ''Riddick'' franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nFugitive [[Riddick (character)|Riddick]] has been in hiding, evading [[bounty hunter]]s and mercenaries sent to capture him. After killing a crew led by mercenary Toombs and stealing his ship on planet U.V., he heads to New Mecca on the planet Helion Prime, after Toombs reveals his bounty originated there. Riddick is reunited with Imam, a holy man he rescued [[Pitch Black (film)#Plot|five years earlier]]. Imam believes Riddick is a Furyan, a member of a race of warriors long thought extinct, and wants to know about his homeworld and if anyone other than himself is left. Imam believes Helion Prime is the next planet to be conquered by a mysterious force crusading across the stars. Aereon, an Air Elemental, identifies the army as the Necromongers, religious fanatics who seek to convert all human life and kill those who refuse. The Necromongers attack and take control of the capital in a single night. In the battle, Imam is killed and Riddick escapes.\n\nThe next day, the Necromonger high priest called \"The Purifier\" coerces the populace into converting, except for Riddick, who kills the man who killed Imam. Intrigued, the Necromongers' leader, the Lord Marshal, orders Riddick be scanned by the Quasi-Dead, half-dead [[Telepathy|telepaths]], who determine that he is indeed a Furyan survivor. Lord Marshal orders Riddick's death, but Riddick escapes only to be recaptured by Toombs. Riddick is taken to Crematoria, a harsh [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] prison moon, where Jack, the girl Riddick also rescued, is being held.\n\nThe Lord Marshal sends Commander Vaako to hunt Riddick down. Vaako's wife speaks to Aereon, who reveals that Furya was devastated by the Lord Marshal after he was told a child from that planet would kill him. Dame Vaako and her husband determine Lord Marshal wants Riddick dead, as he may be the child of said [[prophecy]]. On Crematoria, a disagreement breaks out between Toombs and the prison warden over what Toombs is owed for Riddick's bounty. Word about the Necromongers has reached the prison warden, who deduces that Toombs has stolen Riddick from them. In the prison, Riddick finds Jack, now named Kyra, and they reconcile with each other.\n\nThe guards kill the bounty hunters except for Toombs, take the reward money, and prepare to leave before the Necromongers arrive. After leaving Toombs in a cell, Riddick escapes the prison and leads several prisoners across Crematoria's [[Volcano|volcanic]] surface to steal the ship. The guards reach the hangar, just as the prisoners arrive to find the Necromongers have cornered them there. All of the guards and prisoners are killed, and Riddick is incapacitated by Vaako. With the approach of the deadly sunrise, Vaako leaves Riddick to die and the Necromongers capture Kyra.\n\nRiddick is saved by the Purifier, who tells him that if he stays away from the Necromongers, the Lord Marshal promises not to hunt him. The Purifier then reveals that he too is a Furyan and encourages Riddick to kill the Lord Marshal before committing suicide by walking out into the scorching heat. Riddick then flies back to Helion Prime using Toombs' spacecraft. Meanwhile, Vaako reports Riddick dead and is promoted to a higher rank by the Lord Marshal.\n\nRiddick infiltrates the main hall on the Necromongers' flagship, where Dame Vaako sees him but encourages her husband not to warn the Lord Marshal and to let Riddick strike first and pave the way for Vaako to kill the Lord Marshal and take his place as leader. When Riddick attacks, the Lord Marshal presents Kyra, who appears to have been converted. Riddick fights the Lord Marshal in front of his army, who keeps the upper hand with his supernatural powers. When it appears that Riddick is about to be killed, Kyra stabs the Lord Marshal in the back with a spear and he punches her into a column of spikes, mortally wounding her. Vaako attempts to strike the wounded Lord Marshal, who uses his powers to evade the blow but is stopped by Riddick, who takes the opportunity and swiftly kills him. Kyra dies in Riddick's arms just before the Necromongers, including Vaako, kneel before Riddick as their new leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Richard B. Riddick]], the notorious criminal and last survivor of the Furyan race. Riddick has spent the last five years living in isolation to avoid bounty hunters and mercenaries.\n* [[Colm Feore]] as the Lord Marshal, leader of the Necromonger faith.

Diesel was offered $11 million to return for the sequel, a million dollars more than what he was offered for ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2001/film/news/diesel-to-drive-riddick-1117853167/|title= Diesel to drive \u2018Riddick\u2019|date= September 25, 2001|access-date= April 23, 2022|first= Michael|last= Fleming|work= Variety}}</ref> Universal hired [[David Hayter]] to come up with a script, which was later revised by [[Akiva Goldsman]].
