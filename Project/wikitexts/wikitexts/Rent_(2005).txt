It is an adaptation of the [[Rent (musical)|1996 Broadway musical of the same name]], in turn based on [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s 1896 [[opera]] ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]''.\n\nThe film, which features six of the original Broadway cast members reprising their roles, depicts the lives of several [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] and their struggles with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], paying their rent, and life under the shadow of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in the gritty [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] of [[New York City]] from 1989 to 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Christmas Eve 1989, aspiring filmmaker Mark Cohen, and his roommate, Roger Davis, learn that the rent previously waived by their old friend and now landlord, Benjamin \"Benny\" Coffin III, is due (\"Rent\"). Their former roommate Tom Collins shows up and gets mugged. Mark and Roger meet with Benny, who tells them he plans to evict the homeless from the nearby lot and build a cyber studio (\"You'll See\"). He offers them free rent if they get Maureen, Mark's ex-girlfriend, to cancel her protest against his plans, but they refuse.\n\nA street drummer, Angel, finds Collins and they bond since they are both HIV positive. Roger, who is HIV-positive and a former drug addict, tries to compose his one last great song (\"One Song Glory\"). He's visited by his downstairs neighbor, Mimi, an erotic dancer and heroin addict who tries to convince him to do heroin together despite her own HIV+ status (\"Light My Candle\").\n\nOn Christmas Day, Mark and Roger are visited by Collins and Angel, now in full [[Drag queen|drag]], bearing gifts (\"Today 4 U\"). They invite Mark and Roger to attend Life Support, an AIDS support group. Roger turns them down, while Mark goes to fix Maureen's sound equipment. He runs into Joanne, Maureen's new girlfriend, who bonds with him as they discuss Maureen's promiscuity (\"Tango: Maureen\"). Mark arrives at the Life Support meeting (\"Life Support\"). He films the meeting for the documentary that he's making about people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nMimi visits Roger (\"Out Tonight\"). Roger, whose ex-girlfriend died by suicide after discovering she (and Roger) were HIV positive, rebukes her advances and throws her out (\"Another Day\"). The next day, he joins Mark, Collins and Angel at a Life Support meeting (\"Will I?\"). Leaving the meeting, the group imagines what it would be like to move to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] (\"Santa Fe\"). Roger and Mark leave to help Maureen set up for her performance, and Angel and Collins reveal they are falling in love (\"I'll Cover You\"). Maureen performs her song that calls out Benny for changing who he was when he got married and blames him for trying to shut down the tent city (\"Over the Moon\"). The performance starts a riot because Benny called in police to make sure the protest stayed peaceful, but it escalated into violence. Once the protest is over, the group goes to The Life Cafe and celebrates Mark selling his riot footage to a local news station (\"[[La Vie Boh\u00e8me]]\" or \"La Vie Boh\u00e8me A\").  Roger and Mimi reveal they are falling for each other, and reveal they are HIV positive (\"I Should Tell You\"). They kiss, start a relationship and continue celebrating with their friends (\"Viva La Vie Boh\u00e8me!\" or \"La Vie Boh\u00e8me B\").\n\nOn New Years Day, Benny has padlocked the apartment, but Angel breaks the lock with a garbage can. Mark takes a job at Buzzline, the television news program that he sold his riot footage to. After another fight, Maureen proposes to Joanne; the relationship ends when Maureen flirts with another woman at the engagement party (\"[[Take Me or Leave Me]]\"). After being persuaded by Mimi, his ex-girlfriend, Benny gives the group back their apartment. Over the following year, Roger grows distrustful of Mimi due to her massive usage of drugs, and their relationship ends (\"Without You\"). Angel becomes more ill and eventually succumbs to AIDS. At Angel's funeral on Halloween, the group goes their separate ways after a bitter argument, although Maureen and Joanne reconcile in the process (\"I'll Cover You/Goodbye Love\").\n\nRoger sells his guitar, buys a car, and moves to Santa Fe. He soon returns to New York because he still loves Mimi. Mark quits his job at Buzzline to pursue his own film (\"What You Own\").\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1990, Mark and Roger reunite with Collins, who reveals that he has reprogrammed an ATM to dispense cash when someone inputs the code: A-N-G-E-L. Joanne and Maureen find Mimi on the streets, near death. Mimi and Roger reconcile, and he sings the song that he has written over the past year (\"Finale A/Your Eyes\"). Mimi appears to die but suddenly awakens. She tells them that she was heading to the light, but Angel told her to go back. As Mark's documentary is shown for the first time, the friends reaffirm that there is \"no day but today\" (\"[[Finale B]]\").\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main characters===\n* [[Anthony Rapp]] as Mark Cohen, a struggling Jewish [[filmmaker]] and Roger's roommate. He was dumped by Maureen for Joanne.\n* [[Adam Pascal]] as Roger Davis, an [[HIV]]-positive ex-[[Substance dependence|addict]] [[rock and roll|rock]] [[musician]]; Mimi's love interest.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Mimi Marquez, an [[HIV]]-positive [[heroin]] [[Substance dependence|addict]] and stripper; Roger's love interest.\n* [[Jesse L. Martin]] as Thomas B. \"Tom\" Collins, an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and gay [[philosophy]] professor with AIDS; former roommate of Maureen, Roger, Mark, and Benny; Angel's love interest.\n* [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]] as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen and street musician who is suffering from AIDS; Collins' love interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/mj-rodriguez-talks-her-transition-and-hamilton-audition|title=MJ Rodriguez Talks Her Transition and Hamilton Audition {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|date=7 June 2016|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as Maureen Johnson, a [[bisexual]] performance artist and Joanne's girlfriend; Mark's ex-girlfriend.\n* [[Tracie Thoms]] as Joanne Jefferson, a [[lesbian]] [[Harvard]]-graduate [[lawyer]] and Maureen's love interest.\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Benjamin \"Benny\" Coffin, III, [[landlord]] of the building in which Mark, Roger, and Mimi live and ex-roommate of Collins, Roger, Maureen, and Mark.\n\n===Minor characters===\n* [[Aaron Lohr]] as Steve\n* [[Daniel London]] as Paul\n* [[Wayne Wilcox]] as Gordon\n* [[Chris Chalk]] as Street Vendor\n* [[Mackenzie Firgens]] as April\n* Corey Rosen as Cafe Manager\n* Shaun Earl as Waiter\n* [[Rod Arrants]] as Mr. Hansen\n* Mike Garibaldi as Mr. Grey\n* [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]] as Receptionist (at Buzzline)\n* [[Sarah Silverman]] as Alexi Darling (at Buzzline)\n* Daryl Edwards as Mr. Jefferson\n* [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as Mrs. Jefferson\n* Kevin Blackton as Mr. Johnson\n* Bettina Devin as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Joel Swetow]] as Mr. Cohen\n* [[Randy Graff]] as Mrs. Cohen\n\n==Alternate ending==\nIn addition to four [[deleted scene]]s, the [[DVD]] release of the film includes an alternate ending, showing all the main characters (including Benny, who was not present in the other ending) except Angel standing in the positions where they were during the \"[[Seasons of Love]]\" opening, all standing in a line of spotlights, with Angel's spot empty. Later in the scene, she enters from the side and walks down the line to take her place, stopping as she passes Collins to take his hand for a moment. Although this tableau is used in the finale of the musical, it was dropped from the film for fear that audiences may have wondered why Angel had returned or why the characters were lined up on stage again. In the commentary, Chris Columbus adds that he \"didn't want audiences to think that everything was okay and Angel was alive again.\"\n\n==Differences between the stage and film versions==\n* \"Goodbye Love\" was filmed in its entirety, but the second half was cut from the film because Columbus considered it somewhat of an emotional overload, as he states on the DVD's commentary track.\n* The film leaves ambiguous the death of Roger's girlfriend April, who dies before ''Rent'' begins. In the film, she is seen reading a doctor's report that she is [[HIV-positive people|HIV positive]]; it is stated that she has died, but nothing more is said. In the stage version, Mark explicitly states that April ended her life by slitting her wrists in the bathroom, and Roger found out about his HIV status in the suicide note. Chris Columbus states in the DVD commentary that a scene featuring April lying in the bathtub with her wrists slit was filmed, but cut because he thought it would be \"too much\".\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Rent (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Rent\n| cover      = RentMovie2005.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2005|09|23}}\n| recorded   = 2004-2005\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Musical film|Musical]], [[soundtrack]]\n| length     = 95:00 <small>(2-Disc Movie Soundtrack)</small> <br> 64:38 <small>(Selections Soundtrack)</small>\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.
