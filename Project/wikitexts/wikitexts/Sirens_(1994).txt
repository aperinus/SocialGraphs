There, they meet Lindsay's wife, Rose, two [[model (person)|model]]s, Pru and Sheela, and the maid, Giddy, all of whom pose for Lindsay. Devlin, the half-blind \"odd-job\" man, also poses for Lindsay.\n\nInitially, Tony and Estella are both disturbed by the frank conversations about [[human sexuality]] in which the members of the bohemian group all participate. They are further startled by the amount of [[nudity]] they encounter, both in the studio and outside. As the story unfolds, both Tony and Estella find themselves observing the young women bathing naked in a nearby pool and instead of turning instantly away, each pauses to watch.\n\nJoining the models to swim one morning, Estella is shocked when they bathe naked (she and the maid have come in swimming costumes). Estella is further shocked when Devlin arrives on the scene and the naked women flirt with him, knowing that he cannot see them. On a later occasion, Estella observes the two models caressing the maid, and joins them in stroking her. She doesn't realise that her husband, walking nearby, observes this and is disturbed by the scene's sexual content. At another time, Estella observes Devlin sunbathing naked, and flees when she realises he knows she is there.\n\nEstella is increasingly affected by the sensuality of her surroundings and the bohemian attitude towards sexuality. Her relationship with her husband includes intimacy and commitment, but lacks passion.\n\nThe surroundings and the lives of the models are [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] calls that lead Estella to fantasize with increasing intensity, and (with encouragement from the models) act on a few of her impulses. She suffers morning-after remorse about a late-night visit to Devlin. Influenced by supportive words from her husband, who had witnessed her earlier intimacy with the models, Estella shares a passionate moment with her husband.\n\nWhile Tony is outraged to discover his wife's naked likeness included in one of Lindsay's paintings of a group of naked women, Estella merely observes that it is a good likeness, thus deflating her husband's moral outrage and threats to sue. The next day Tony and Estella leave the bucolic compound. They travel back home on a train in a shared suite and, showing a changed attitude, Estella caresses Tony with her stocking-covered foot. She falls asleep on the train, and dreams she is naked on a cliff with the other women.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Reverend Anthony Campion\n* [[Tara Fitzgerald]] as Estella Campion\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Norman Lindsay]]\n* [[Elle Macpherson]] as Sheela\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Giddy \n* [[Kate Fischer]] as Pru\n* [[Pamela Rabe]] as Rose Lindsay\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Lewis\n* [[John Polson]] as Tom\n* [[Mark Gerber]] as Devlin\n* [[Vincent Ball]] as Bishop of Sydney\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was a long-standing project of John Duigan:\n\n<blockquote>The starting point was the idea of doing something on the tension between the church's teaching and the sensual side of life. I have always felt that the church's actual teachings on this issue\u2014since I experienced it first-hand as a boy at school\u2014reflected some biases, particularly against the place and role of women in the church, and the place of women's sensuality. I wanted to deal with these sorts of issues but I also wanted to explore them in a comic context. It's a film about sensuality but if you don't have a humorous aspect, then I think you're missing out on a particular dimension of the sensuality.<ref name=\"signet\">[https://archive.today/20130112013222/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=John+Duigan&bl \"Interview with John Duigan\", ''Signet'', 28 April 1994 and 17 May 1997] accessed 18 November 2012</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe originally pitched the project to [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell|Kennedy Miller]] after making ''Fragments of War'' but they passed.<ref name=\"duigan\">Scott Murray, \"John Duigan: Awakening the Dormant\", ''Cinema Papers'', November 1989 p31-35, 77</ref>\n\nDuigan told film critic [[Stephen Farber]] what drew him to cast Grant: \"Hugh has the capacity to be a terrific player of light comedy, in the tradition of [[Cary Grant]] and [[David Niven]]. He has the same ease and urbanity in the way he moves and talks.\"<ref name=\"farber\" /> Grant told Farber what he brought to the character of the Anglican priest:\n\n<blockquote>I kept looking at the part and wondered how I could crack it, because he was such a straitlaced character. And then I realized that if he thought he was trendy and ''avant-garde'', that added a whole new swing to it. I see him as quite the star of his theological college, probably quite daring with his Turkish cigarettes. And I imagine that he even makes the occasional sexual reference in his conversation after a couple of glasses of sherry. But confronted with the real McCoy, in the form of Elle Macpherson without her clothes, he's hopeless.<ref name=\"farber\" /></blockquote>\n\nMost of the film is set at what is now the [[Norman Lindsay Gallery and Museum]], which was the original home of the real-life Lindsay with sequences filmed at the railway station at [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales]].\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"''Sirens'' is best watched as a [[Softcore pornography|soft-core]], high-minded daydream about the liberating sensuality of art...[it] has an archly intelligent performance from Mr. Grant, who turns the priest's embarrassment into a real comic virtue. Ms. Fitzgerald, who made a strong first impression in ''[[Hear My Song]]'', is again a forceful presence, even when acting out the story's giddy erotic fantasies.\"<ref name=\"nytreview\">{{cite news | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402EFDB103AF937A35750C0A962958260 | title=Sirens (1994) / Review/Film; Naughtiness in Pooh Land | date=4 March 1994 | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Janet | last=Maslin | authorlink=Janet Maslin }}</ref> Maslin said the film \"often verges on silliness and desperately overworks the [[Serpent (symbolism)|symbolic importance of snakes]].
