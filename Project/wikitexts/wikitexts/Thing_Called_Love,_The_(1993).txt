[[River Phoenix]], [[Dermot Mulroney]] and [[Sandra Bullock]] also star. While the film involves a love triangle and various complications in Miranda's route to success, it provides a sweetened glimpse at the lives of aspiring songwriters in Nashville. Its tagline is: \"Stand by your dream\".\n\nThe film was Phoenix's final complete screen performance before his death. Bogdanovich called the movie \"a little picture with a slightly meandering French quality.\"<ref>'Pardon my dust' says hopeful director: [SU2 Edition]\nGlenn Lovell SPECIAL TO THE STAR.

After arriving in Music City after a long bus ride, Miranda makes her way to the [[Bluebird Caf\u00e9]], a local watering hole with a reputation as a showcase for new talent. The bar's owner, Lucy, takes a shine to the plucky newcomer and gives her a job as a waitress.\n\nBefore long, Miranda has gotten to know a number of other Nashville transplants who are looking to land a gig or sell a song, including sweet and open-hearted Kyle Davidson, moody but talented James Wright, and spunky Linda Lue Linden. As the four friends struggle to find their place in the competitive Nashville music scene, both Kyle and James display a romantic interest in Miranda, but she is drawn to James in spite of his moody temperament. Miranda pursues James, and they end up getting married, but they soon realize marriage takes work. James leaves Miranda behind to make his album, what he always wanted to do, but realizes he left his heart with her. He comes back to the Bluebird Cafe but discovers that Miranda has left town. Miranda returns and sings a new song, before tentatively reuniting with James. Kyle joins them as Linda Lue leaves for New York, and the remaining three discuss writing a song together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[River Phoenix]] as James Wright\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as Miranda Presley\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Kyle Davidson\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Linda Lue Linden\n* [[K.

But one day, it was freezing cold and the other day, he took some kind of cold medicine that didn't agree with him. That was what I was told. But all the rest of the time, he was great...  He was concerned with more than his own role. He was concerned with the overall picture, with the other actors and characters... He would have made a very good director.\"\"<ref name=\"another\"/>\n\nThe film focuses on the songwriters rather than the performers. \"It's a different kind of crowd,\" said Bogdanovich. \"More cerebral, less about the glitz.\"<ref name=\"salt\"/>\n\nThe film features cameos from Trisha Yearwood, Pam Tillis and Kevin Welch. River Phoenix wrote two songs including \"Lone Star State of Mine\"; Dermot Mulroney wrote one, and Sandra Bullock wrote lyrics for the song she performed.

It was expected to open wider in autumn but Paramount decided against this following the death of [[River Phoenix]]. The movie ultimately ranked among the least profitable films of 1993. \"[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] did do some releases in Seattle and a few other places,\" said Bogdanovich in 1994. \"But I think they were afraid of being accused of exploiting River's death. There was a kind of general worry about that. I guess that is the thinking that prevailed. It's pretty disappointing, but you know, I've learned to go on.\"<ref name=\"another\"/>\n\nThe director felt the death of Phoenix affected watching the movie. \"It was a totally different movie before. It had a hopeful quality and now it doesn't. The ending is ambiguous, but because River died, it becomes very sad. The last thing you're left with is that he is dead, even though the character is alive ... (The movie) was supposed to be bittersweet, but it turned out being more bitter than sweet.\"<ref name=\"another\">ANOTHER BOGDANOVICH FILM IS HEADED FOR CULT STATUS: [THIRD Edition]\nLongsdorf, Amy.
