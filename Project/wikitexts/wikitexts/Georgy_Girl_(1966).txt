Directed by [[Silvio Narizzano]], the film was based on the 1965 novel by [[Margaret Forster]].\n\nThe plot follows the story of a virginal young woman in 1960s [[Swinging London]] who is faced with a dilemma when she is pursued by her father's older employer and the young lover of her promiscuous, pregnant flatmate.\n\n==Plot==\nThe opening credits show the title character walking through the streets of London and being tempted into a hairdressers where she has her hair set in a far more contemporary style. She immediately changes her mind, and runs through the streets until she reaches a public lavatory. Once there, she submerges her hair in a sink-full of water, happy to return to her previously unkempt hairstyle.\n\nGeorgina (\"Georgy\") Parkin ([[Lynn Redgrave]]) is a 22-year-old Londoner who has considerable musical talent, is well-educated, and has an engaging, unpretentious character. At the same time, she believes herself to be plain and slightly overweight, she dresses haphazardly, and she is incredibly na\u00efve on the subjects of love and flirtation. She has never had a boyfriend. She has an inventive imagination and loves children.\n\nHer parents are live-in employees of successful businessman James Leamington ([[James Mason]]), who runs a children's home. Leamington is 49 and has a loveless, childless marriage with Ellen ([[Rachel Kempson]]). He watched Georgy grew up and treated her as if he were her second father. He provided for her private education at a Swiss finishing school and for a studio in his home, where she teaches dance to children. Leamington thinks Georgy \"owes him\" for all he has done.\n\nAs Georgy has become a young woman, his feelings for her have become more than fatherly: James offers Georgy a legal contract, proposing to supply her with the luxuries of life in return for her becoming his mistress. Georgy sidesteps his proposal by never giving him a direct response; Leamington's business-like language and manner (and awkward inability to express any affection for her) leave her cold.\n\nGeorgy's flatmate is the beautiful Meredith ([[Charlotte Rampling]]), who is a violinist in an orchestra, but is otherwise a shallow woman who lives for her own pleasures. She treats the meekly compliant Georgy like an unpaid servant. Georgy has a crush on Meredith's boyfriend Jos Jones ([[Alan Bates]]) and is happy to accommodate Meredith in order to spend time with Jos. She cooks for him and they play Scrabble together.\n\nWhen Meredith discovers that she is pregnant by Jos, they get married. She tells him bluntly that she has aborted two of his children, but she wants to marry because she is \"bored.\" Jos moves in with the two young women. He becomes disillusioned with Meredith and begins to find himself attracted to Georgy, who convinces Leamington to buy several expensive items for the baby's care.\n\nWhile in the midst of an argument with Meredith over her cavalier attitude to her pregnancy, Jos suddenly kisses Georgy and tells her that he loves her. Georgy flees the apartment onto the streets of London, where Jos follows her, screaming over and over again that he loves her as he pursues her.\n\nThe two return to the flat, where they have sex, after which there is a knock at the door by Peggy, a friend of Meredith, who tells Jos that Meredith has gone to the hospital to give birth. Jos and Georgy go to the hospital, where Georgy tries to comfort Meredith while she is in labour. Jos and Georgy's secret love affair continues.\n\nMeredith gives birth to a daughter they name Sara. Because she has no interest in the baby and has tired of Jos, she announces that she plans to put the child up for adoption and divorce him.\n\nGeorgy and Jos set up home together in the flat, caring for baby Sara and living as a common-law married couple. It becomes clear that Georgy cares more for the baby than for having an adult relationship with Jos. Their relationship ends when Jos tires of a father's responsibilities; he abandons her and his baby. Now that Georgy is the sole caregiver of a baby to whom she has no blood ties, Social Services wishes to remove baby Sara from her care.\n\nIn the recent past, Mr Leamington's wife suddenly died. Leamington, who was unable to express his true feelings for Georgy while his wife was alive, now finds himself free to express his love for her, so he proposes marriage. Georgy accepts because this will allow her to keep Sara. The two marry despite the difference in their backgrounds and ages. They officially adopt Sara, making Georgy a mother. As the newlyweds are chauffeured away from their wedding, Georgy ignores her new husband, devoting all her attention to baby Sara.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Georgina \"Georgy\" Parkin \n* [[James Mason]] as James Leamington\n* [[Alan Bates]] as Jos Jones\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Meredith\n* [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as Ted Parkin\n* [[Clare Kelly]] as Doris Parkin\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] (Lynn Redgrave's mother) as Ellen Leamington\n* [[Denise Coffey]] as Peg\n* [[Peggy Thorpe-Bates]] as Hospital Sister\n* [[Dandy Nichols]] as Hospital Nurse\n* [[Dorothy Alison]] as Health Visitor\n* [[Terence Soall]] as Salesman\n* [[Ian Dunn (actor)|Ian Dunn]] as Baby Sara\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Locations===\nSeveral scenes were filmed in north London, in [[Belsize Park]] and [[Little Venice, London|Little Venice]], notably outside a canalside house on Maida Avenue.\n\n===Title song===\nThe title song \"[[Georgy Girl (song)|Georgy Girl]]\", written by [[Tom Springfield]] and [[Jim Dale]], was recorded by Australian band [[The Seekers]].
