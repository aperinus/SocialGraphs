The film premiered in the [[United Arab Emirates]] on December 15, 2005, but did not receive a North American release until over two years later, where it was distributed [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] on February 19, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\n[[Seattle Police Department|Seattle PD]] Detective Quentin Conners and his partner Jason York are implicated in the death of a hostage taken by a [[carjacker]] named John Curtis. After a fellow police officer, Callo, testifies against them, Conners is suspended, and York is fired. In reality, York tried to shoot Curtis, but accidentally killed the hostage. Curtis in turn fired back, and Conners killed him in self-defense.\n\nSome time later, Lorenz and four other criminals take hostages in a bank. Lorenz has only one demand, to negotiate with Conners. Conners is reinstated but put under the surveillance of a new partner, the recently-graduated Shane Dekker. Conners is given control of the negotiations, and after a bank teller is shot, he orders a [[SWAT]] unit to cut the building's power and go in. During an explosion, the criminals flee during the ensuing panic and chaos.\n\nDekker and Conners learn more about each other at a local diner, slowly building a friendship, but Dekker disapproves of Conners' \"cowboy cop\" methods. Dekker explains that during negotiations, Lorenz was making many cryptic references to [[chaos theory]]. As they leave to examine new evidence, Conners puts a ten dollar bill on the table for his share of the bill. Dekker swaps the ten for a twenty of his own. A TV camera caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a scent used to mark evidence collected by the police. The banknote serial numbers did not come from that day's robbery, but had been placed in police storage and signed out two weeks earlier by Callo. He is found shot dead in his home, together with incriminating evidence linking him to the heist.\n\nWhen reviewing video footage from the bank, Dekker notices one corner of the bank is deliberately shielded from view. In that corner, they find the bank regional manager's computer. Fingerprints on the keyboard reveal the identity of a hacker that Conners himself had arrested, but whose conviction was overturned after the shooting on the bridge. Conners and Dekker want to question the hacker, but he is shot dead by Lorenz, and a gunfight ensues, during which Lorenz manages to escape. Dekker questions the hospitalized bank robber identified in the news footage and finally breaks him when he casually explains the impact of a massive overdose of morphine while slowly injecting something into the suspect's drip. An amazed Conners watches and later calls him a hypocrite. Dekker responds by explaining he only injected more saline solution.\n\nThe suspect reveals Lorenz is Scott Curtis, the brother of John shot earlier, and Conners leads a stakeout at an address where all the gang are to meet that night; Scott's house. Forced to go before Scott arrives, a shootout results in both suspects' deaths, and a bomb blows up the building while Conners is inside. Dekker is devastated but realizes that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged by the evidence custody officer, who reveals that Scott is actually York. In a flashback, York stands on the bridge and fires the first shot, killing the hostage in the opening sequence. Tracking Lorenz/York's mobile phone, Dekker surprises York at a diner, and York takes a woman hostage in a reversal of the standoff on the bridge. Dekker chases and eventually kills York.\n\nWhen Dekker pays for his coffee at the diner, he discovers the banknote Conners used to pay for lunch with is also scented, which means Conners was also involved in taking the money from police evidence. Dekker finds a copy of [[James Gleick]]'s ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'' in Conners' house, showing he had faked an earlier ignorance of the mathematics. On a hunch, Dekker looks for airline tickets booked in Gleick's name and runs to the airport.\n\nDuring a mobile call between the now disguised Conners and the searching Dekker at the busy airport, flashbacks reveal how the seemingly unconnected events in the film form a pattern, just as predicted in chaos theory. Conners reveals that he placed his badge on the corpse of one of York's henchmen before the explosion. Conners and York recruited a group of ex-convicts from their past. Callo was framed for being a dirty cop. Conners ends the call, walks casually to a private jet, and takes off while sipping champagne.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Detective Quentin Conners\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Detective Shane Dekker\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Lorenz / Jason York \n* [[Henry Czerny]] as Captain Martin Jenkins\n* [[Justine Waddell]] as Detective Teddy Calloway\n* [[Nicholas Lea]] as Detective Vincent Durano\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Marnie Rollins\n* [[Jessica Steen]] as Karen Cross\n* [[John Cassini]] as Bernie Callo\n* [[Damon Johnson]] as Brendan Dax\n* [[Paul Perri]] as Harry Hume\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as Gina Lopez\n* [[Ty Olsson]] as Damon Richards\n* [[Terry Chen]] as Chris Lei\n* [[Mike Dopud]] as Lamar Galt\n* Rob LaBelle as Bank Manager\n* [[Garvin Cross]] as SWAT Commander\n* Michasha Armstrong as Xander Harrington\n* Kim Howey as Lisa Reane\n* Gaston Howard as John Curtis\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was a co-production between the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Principal photography took place in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} in locations including [[Simon Fraser University]] and the [[Burrard Street Bridge]].\n\nThe film was originally set to be produced by [[Franchise Pictures]] with distribution by [[Warner Bros.]], which began to suffer serious financial problems early into production due to the failures of its previous film [[Battlefield Earth (film)|''Battlefield Earth'']], and allegations of fraud concerning artificial inflation of the film's budget to increase investment from German production company Intertainment AG.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2002-06-06 |title=Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com - Studio Briefing - 6 June 2002|date=2008-12-16 |access-date=2017-12-16|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216135754/http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2002-06-06#film5 |archivedate=16 December 2008 |quote=FBI Probes Big Indie Budgets }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-68663518/franchise-intertainment-duel|title=Franchise, Intertainment duel. {{!}} HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared|date=2013-01-25|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-12-16|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125033450/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-68663518/franchise-intertainment-duel|archive-date=2013-01-25}}</ref> This led to Franchise's then-parent company Mobius International to take over production. Due to last-minute budgetary constraints imposed by the new producers, the film's script was heavily rewritten to accommodate a reduced shooting schedule (40 days to 22 days). Lead actor [[Jason Statham]] had signed a two-picture deal with Franchise, a deal which included both ''Chaos'' and a [[heist film]] titled ''Baker Street''. The latter was placed on hold after Franchise filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]], where it was eventually produced by [[Relativity Media]] and released in 2008 under the title ''[[The Bank Job]]''.\n\n==Release==\n===Distribution===\n[[Screen Gems]] at one point was attached as the film's theatrical distributor, but a financial deal couldn't be made regarding release prints and advertising between the studio and producers. Eventually [[Lionsgate]] picked up the film and went through the same drama with producers, leading to a three-year delay in the film's [[North America]]n release.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical response===\nMichael S.
