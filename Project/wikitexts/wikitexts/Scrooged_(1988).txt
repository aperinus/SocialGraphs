Based on the 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], ''Scrooged'' is a modern retelling that follows [[Bill Murray]] as Frank Cross, a cynical and selfish television executive, who is visited by a succession of ghosts on Christmas Eve intent on helping him regain his Christmas spirit. The film also stars [[Karen Allen]], [[John Forsythe]], [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], [[Carol Kane]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Michael J. Pollard]], and [[Alfre Woodard]].\n\n''Scrooged'' was filmed on a $32 million budget over three months in New York City and Hollywood. Murray returned to acting for the film after taking a four-year hiatus following the success of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', which he found overwhelming. Murray worked with Glazer and O'Donoghue on reworking the script before agreeing to join the project. The production was tumultuous, as Murray and Donner had different visions for the film. Murray described his time on the film as \"misery\", while Donner called Murray \"superbly creative but occasionally difficult\". Along with Murray's three brothers, [[Brian Doyle-Murray|Brian]], John, and [[Joel Murray|Joel]], ''Scrooged'' features numerous celebrity cameos.\n\nThe film's marketing capitalized on Murray's ''Ghostbusters'' role, referencing his encounters with ghosts in both films. ''Scrooged'' was released on November 23, 1988, and grossed over $100 million worldwide. The film received a positive response from test audiences, but was met with a mixed response upon its release from critics who found the film too mean spirited or too sentimental. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]], but lost to the fantasy-comedy film ''[[Beetlejuice]]''.\n\nSince its release, ''Scrooged'' has become a regular television Christmastime feature, with some critics calling it an alternative to traditional Christmas films, and others arguing that ''Scrooged'' was ahead of its time, making it relevant in the modern day. It has appeared on various lists of the best Christmas films.\n\n== Plot ==\nIBC Television president Frank Cross is pushing his company to broadcast an extravagant live production of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' on Christmas Eve, making the staff work throughout the holiday. Frank fires executive Eliot Loudermilk for disagreeing with him, and sends cheap IBC-monogrammed towels to most of the people on his Christmas list, including his personal assistant Grace and his brother James, while the powerful and influential people on his list get an expensive four-head hi-fi stereo [[VCR]]. Frank's boss Preston Rhinelander, seeing the stress Frank is under with the production, brings in Brice Cummings to provide assistance, though Brice secretly wants Frank's job.\n\nThe night before the show, Frank is visited by the ghost of his mentor Lew Hayward, an unloved miser who died from a heart attack seven years prior. Lew warns him three more ghosts will appear to him over the next day to help Frank avoid the same fate. Before it vanishes, the ghost dials up Claire Phillips, Frank's lost love from years ago. Claire comes to the network to talk to Frank, but Frank does not make time for her and she returns to the homeless shelter where she works.\n\nAs rehearsals start, Frank is visited by the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], appearing as a manic taxi driver. He takes Frank to see his past: how he found solace in television after his mother left his father, and how he had fallen in love with Claire but lost her when he prioritized his television career over her. In the present, Frank goes to the shelter to see Claire, hoping to make amends. However, his attitude quickly sours and he shows his contempt for a homeless man named Herman and the shelter workers. He returns to the studio, but not before telling Claire: \"If you wanna save someone, save yourself.\"\n\nThe [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] arrives as an ethereal, sweet-voiced fairy who punches, kicks and slaps Frank to focus his attention. She takes him to Grace's apartment, showing his assistant's struggles to support her large family, including her youngest son Calvin who has remained mute since witnessing his father's death. The Ghost then shows him James, spending a humble yet festive Christmas with a group of friends and his wife Wendie.\n\nJames still defends Frank, despite Frank's cheap gifts and his refusal to share in Christmas celebrations with him. The Ghost leaves him in a utility space under a sidewalk with Herman, who, Frank finds to his shock, has frozen to death. Frank desperately tries to escape, breaking through a boarded-up door to end back up on the set of the production. Preston directs Brice to take over rehearsals to give Frank some time off.\n\nRetiring to his office, Frank finds a drunken Eliot waiting for him with a shotgun, ready to kill Frank for causing the loss of his job and family. Frank escapes into the elevator where the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-like [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Ghost of Christmas Future]] awaits. The Ghost takes him to the future where a now-catatonic Calvin has been institutionalized. Claire has heeded Frank's words and married rich, now viewing the homeless with disgust.\n\nFinally, the Ghost shows Frank's cremation ceremony, with only James and Wendie in attendance. Frightened and remorseful, Frank is further shocked to find himself inside the casket as it is about to be incinerated; he breaks his way out, ending up out of the elevator and facing Eliot. Frank's completely changed demeanor surprises Eliot, particularly when Frank offers him a high-level executive position.\n\nWith Eliot's help, Frank returns to the production set, secures Brice in the control room, and breaks into the show's live broadcast to speak of his new appreciation for life. He apologizes on-air to Grace, James, and the cast and crew, and makes a passionate plea to Claire to come back to him. Claire sees this at the shelter and heads for the network with the help of the Ghost of Christmas Past. As Frank and Claire reunite, Calvin comes up to Frank and speaks for the first time, reminding him to say the words \"God bless us, everyone\", much to Grace's elation. Frank leads the crew in singing \"[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]\", and sees Lew, the three Ghosts, and the ghost of Herman smiling and waving back to him while singing along.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Alfre Woodard]] in 2012 (left) and [[Karen Allen]] in 2017\n| image1 = Alfre Woodard 2012.jpg\n| image2 = Karenallen17 cropped.jpg\n}}\n\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Frank Cross\n* [[Karen Allen]] as Claire Phillips\n* [[John Forsythe]] as Lew Hayward\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Eliot Loudermilk\n* [[Carol Kane]] as the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]]\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Preston Rhinelander\n* [[Michael J.

When he did feel a desire to return to acting, he said the \"scripts were just not that good\", and he returned to the ''Scrooged'' project as he found the idea of making a funny Scrooge appealing.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|pp=29,31}} Murray was paid $6 million for his role. Producer [[Art Linson]] justified the figure, by saying that for each year Murray stayed away from films, his audience draw and therefore fee potentially increased. At the time, Linson said that aside from [[Eddie Murphy]], Murray's was the only other name that could draw $10 million of tickets in the opening three to four days.<ref name=\"NYT1988\"/>\n\nMurray wanted several changes to the script once he joined the project; among other changes, the romantic plot with Karen Allen's Claire was expanded, and the family scenes were reworked as Murray felt they were \"off\".{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=29}} Murray worked with scriptwriters, [[Michael O'Donoghue]] and [[Mitch Glazer]] (whom Murray had previously worked with on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') until Murray was confident enough to begin filming.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=31}}<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> O'Donoghue and Glazer found the film's denouement, in which Murray reveals his redemption live on TV, to be the most difficult to write. They settled on the example of Christmas Eve in New York, where people are nice to each other for one night, believing it to be a \"miracle we could live with\".{{sfn|Perrin|1998|p=408}}\n\nMurray was concerned with how he should portray the scene, with Glazer telling him to follow the script. Wanting a central acting moment, however, Murray gave an emotional and manic performance, deviating from his marked positions and improvising his speech. Glazer and O'Donoghue thought that the actor was suffering a mental breakdown. After he was finished, the crew applauded Murray, but O'Donoghue remarked \"What was that? The [[Jim Jones]] hour?\" Donner turned and punched O'Donoghue in the arm, leaving him bruised for a week.{{sfn|Perrin|1998|p=408-409}}\n\nIn a 1989 interview, Murray said, \"He shot a big, long, sloppy movie\", describing how a lot of filmed content was not present in the film's final cut.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=29}} For his part, O'Donoghue later said that Donner did not understand comedy, omitting the script's subtler elements for louder and faster moments. He estimated that only 40% of his and Glazer's original script made it into the final film and the surviving content was \"twisted\".{{sfn|Perrin|1998|p=409}} The final cut of the film runs for 97 minutes.<ref name=\"BBFC\"/>\n\nThe production was rife with conflict between Murray and Donner. In a 1990 interview with [[Roger Ebert]], Murray said that ''Scrooged'' \"could have been a really, really great movie. The script was so good... He [Donner] kept telling me to do things louder, louder, louder. I think he was deaf.\"<ref name=\"CSTEbert\"/> In a later 1993 interview, Murray said that he and Donner had different visions for the type of film ''Scrooged'' would become,<ref name=\"EW1993\"/> adding that there was potentially only one take in the finished film that was his.<ref name=\"EW2014\"/>\n\nHe described the experience as having a \"fair amount of misery\" and said \"That's a tough one; I still have trouble talking about [''Scrooged'']\",<ref name=\"EW1993\"/> describing working on a \"dusty, smelly, and smokey\" set, feeling alone, and even coughing up blood due to the [[fake snow]] being used.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=32}} He also admitted to feeling pressure from being the solo star of a film compared to previous productions like ''Ghostbusters'', as he was on set mostly every day where some actors would make brief cameos requiring only a day or two of work.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=31}}\n\nDonner himself said that he had never worked with Murray before and met up with him for drinks before accepting the project to see if they would get along; they did. The director was more positive about their relationship, describing Murray as \"superbly creative but occasionally difficult - as difficult as any actor.\" Donner said that Murray was always in a working mindset on set, believing it made him tired, so the crew would do \"silly things\" to improve morale.{{Sfn|Blade|1988|p=Section E, Page 3}} Donner had not worked with an improvisational comedian like Murray before, who ad-libbed many of his lines, saying \"you don't direct [Murray], you pull him back\".{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=31}}<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/>\n\n=== Casting ===\nBill Murray said that \"being the meanest person in the world\" as Frank Cross was fun. He described his challenge as having an edge but then completing Cross' transformation into a decent person at the end. Murray said \"being a decent person is not that hard. But acting like one is.\"{{Sfn|Blade|1988|p=Section E, Page 3}} Carol Kane's ghost was intended to have a body double for ballet scenes until set designer saw Kane rehearsing the dance and convinced Donner that the resulting scene would be funnier with Kane's \"horrible\" dancing.<ref name=\"AVKane\"/>\n\nDonner and Murray said that Kane would sometimes experience long crying periods during filming, caused by frustration over her violent scenes. Murray also endured some physical pain during his encounters with Kane's character, insisting that she actually hit him during their scenes together, and at one point tearing the inside of his lip when Kane pulled his lip too hard.{{Sfn|Starlog|1989|p=31}} Kane herself said \"I hit Bill Murray with a toaster, and with my wings, and I kicked him in areas that weren't pleasant for him. I had fun. I don't think it was as fun for Bill, because he was the victim! I did what the stunt people told me, but when I had to flap my wings in his face, I really couldn't control them.\"<ref name=\"hollywoodlife\"/>\n\nThe film also features Murray's three brothers; [[Joel Murray]] cameos as a party guest, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Frank's father, and John Murray plays his on-screen brother James.<ref name=\"AMCBlog\"/> The film also features the final appearance of the [[Solid Gold (TV series)#The Solid Gold Dancers|Solid Gold Dancers]].<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> Comedian [[Sam Kinison]] was considered for the role of the Ghost of Christmas Past before it went to musician David Johansen, a personal friend of Murray's. Robert Mitchum cameos as Frank's boss Preston Rhinelander; the actor was not interested in the small role, but Donner asked him to meet with Murray, who convinced him to take the part.<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> Lee Majors cameos as himself in the film after being contacted directly by Donner. Majors appears in the opening scene helping to save Santa Claus. Majors was armed with a stripped-down [[M134 Minigun]], the same one featured in ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', which he found difficult to carry due to its weight.<ref name=\"AVCameo\"/>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nIn 1989, [[A&M Records]] released the soundtrack to ''Scrooged'', which features nine songs.

Brown said that ''Scrooged'' was unlikely to become a seasonal tradition like ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947), considering that it would age poorly and either scare or be too adult for child audiences.<ref name=\"RevWP\"/>\n\nThe ''Los Angeles Times''{{'}}s Sheila Benson said the film's opening is its high-point, featuring the parody IBC lineup of \"Robert Goulet's Cajun Christmas\" and \"The Night the Reindeer Died\", but as the film progresses the laughs become more sporadic and the tone becomes darker. Benson said that the film is a \"mass of sharp, well-deserved paper cuts\" to the entertainment industry, citing Murray's character whose life knowledge is based on the [[Golden Age of Television]], and Mitchum's character who wants to add elements to the network shows that attract pet audiences, but Benson lamented that these details were never expanded upon.<ref name=\"RevLAT\"/>\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the story was uproarious and sometimes vitriolic, labeling it a scathing satire of the entertainment industry, that was a \"wild and wooly holiday feast that should scrape off the competition\". Their review continued that ''Scrooged'' features \"wickedly amusing flashbacks\", but also some overwrought comic misfires.<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/> The ''Radio Times''{{'}} John Ferguson appreciated the film, calling it a \"joyously black Christmas treat\", but once the \"sentimentality starts seeping in\", it seems like a misstep.<ref name=\"RevRT\"/> A 2007 review by ''[[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]'' agreed, saying that the film and Murray are at their best before the redemption begins, and that the only film to come close to capturing Murray's vitriol was ''[[Bad Santa]]'' (2003).<ref name=\"RevDOG\"/>\n\n[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called ''Scrooged'' an ironic film, for seemingly condemning the commercialization of Christmas while also capitalizing on it, taking on the moral message of ''A Christmas Carol'', \"without sacrificing its [[yuppie]] priorities for an instant\". Rosenbaum cited the ending in particular, wherein Frank gives his Christmas message, causing Karen to leave the needy homeless to come to his side, and both are watched over approvingly by Herman, a homeless man who froze to death.<ref name=\"RevJR\"/> Ebert and ''Empire'' concurred about the ending. Ebert said that the necessary words are spoken by the characters, but it lacks heart, continues at embarrassing length, and seems like an onscreen breakdown.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> ''Empire'' also called the ending embarrassing and beyond Murray's capabilities.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Conversely, the BBC's Ben Falk said it is hard not to join in singing at the end.<ref name=\"RevBBC\"/>\n\nCritics were divided by Murray's performance.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/><ref name=\"RevBBC\"/> Falk said that Murray is a comic genius at his best, and Brown said that he created a credible, comic character.<ref name=\"RevWP\"/><ref name=\"RevBBC\"/> Ferguson said that the first part of ''Scrooged'' featured Murray at \"his sour faced best\".<ref name=\"RevRT\"/> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' called him \"hilariously convincing\" and \"impressively sinister\" as the TV executive, saying that his hip and sassy performance gives the film energy, nuttiness and charm. Their review said that his deadpan, cutting style was hilarious, but that he layers the character's histrionics with inner sensibility that makes his eventual redemption believable and uplifting.<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/>\n\nConversely, Ebert said that Murray looks genuinely unhappy, and lacked the lightness and good cheer lurking beneath previous performances. Ebert also criticized Murray's ad-libbing, blaming it for being at odds with, and blocking the flow of the story.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> Benson said that Murray imbued Frank Cross' worst attributes with sincerity, making his redemption difficult to accept.<ref name=\"RevLAT\"/>\n\nCarol Kane was praised for her performance, with ''The Hollywood Reporter'' referring to her as a \"certified hoot\", and ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Sara Vilkomerson saying that she \"steals the show\" from Murray.<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/><ref name=\"RevEW\"/> Benson said that watching her fragile, winged character pummel Murray was \"strangely satisfying\", although the joke eventually wore out.<ref name=\"RevLAT\"/> Benson was more positive on Woodard, saying that she offered the film's one completely persuasive performance.<ref name=\"RevLAT\"/>\n\n''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praised Woodard, Mitchum, and John Glover's credible portrayal of a sleazy executive. Both ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and Brown appreciated Goldthwait's role, with Brown calling it \"twitchingly touching\".<ref name=\"RevWP\"/><ref name=\"RevTHR\"/> Thomas called Johansen's Ghost of Christmas Past a \"bonus\", but he and Benson lamented the \"king's ransom of actors\" that were wasted.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevLAT\"/> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that Elfman's music is \"full blast with holiday spirit\", and singled out [[J. Michael Riva]]'s production design, calling it \"dead on the mark funny\".<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/>\n\nO'Donoghue was very critical of the finished film. He said, \"We wrote a fucking masterpiece. We wrote ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934). We wrote a story that could make you laugh and cry. You would have wanted to share it with your grandchildren every fucking Christmas for the next 100 years. The finished film was a piece of unadulterated, unmitigated shit.\"{{sfn|Perrin|1998|p=409}}\n\n=== Awards ===\nMake up artists [[Thomas R. Burman]] and [[Bari Dreiband-Burman]] were responsible for the film's single nomination at the [[61st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], losing to ''[[Beetlejuice]]''.<ref name=\"Acco61st\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince its release, ''Scrooged'' has become a [[Cult following|cult classic]]<ref name=\"LegacyIGN\"/> and a Christmas classic, being regularly shown on television during the holiday period. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Whitney Pastorek called it an immortal classic and argued that it is the most underrated Christmas movie. Pastorek said that the film is \"both crude and sentimental, resonant and ludicrous...''Scrooged'' is the perfect holiday movie for bitter, reluctant, closet Christmas lovers\".<ref name=\"LegacyEW\"/> ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Maura Johnston said that the film was ahead of its time which allowed it to remain relevant years later.<ref name=\"LegacyBoston\"/>\n\n''PopMatters'' said that their view of the ongoing commercialization of Christmas, and the film's anticipation of marketing tactics aimed at pets watching television, made the film more relevant now than at the time of its release.<ref name=\"LegacyBoston\"/><ref name=\"LegacyPOP\"/> In 2012, ''Den of Geek!'' described it as the \"finest Christmas comedy of all time\".<ref name=\"LegacyDOG\"/> Al Green's and Annie Lennox's \"Put a Little Love in your Heart\" is also played regularly at Christmas despite not being about or mentioning Christmas.<ref name=\"LegacyBoston\"/> O'Donoghue disavowed the film before his death, stating that the script was much funnier than what ended up on screen.<ref name=\"AVODono\"/>\n\nContemporary review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] offers a score of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews\u2014an average rating of {{RT data|average}}, which provides the consensus: \"''Scrooged'' gets by with Bill Murray and a dash of holiday spirit, although it's hampered by a markedly conflicted tone and an undercurrent of mean-spiritedness.\"<ref name=\"Tomatoes\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scrooged|title=Scrooged|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> The film also has a score of 38 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critics indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref name=\"RevMeta\"/>\n\nIn 2015, [[IGN]] named it the 11th-best holiday movie of all time.<ref name=\"LegacyIGN\"/> In 2016, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' listed ''Scrooged'' as the seventh-best Christmas film, and in 2017, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' and ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' listed it as, respectively, the 12th-best and 23rd best.<ref name=\"LegacyRankEMP\"/><ref name=\"LegacyRankTime\"/><ref name=\"LegacyRankCOS\"/> That same year, Collider named it the fifth-best adaptation of ''A Christmas Carol'', calling it is easily the best non-traditional translation of the story, and saying that it uses \"a classic tale of redemption as the framework for a satire of modern culture's desire to embrace the irredeemable\".<ref name=\"LegacyCollider\"/>\n\nIn 2018, ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' said that even 30 years after its debut, the film represented the perfect Christmas movie, saying it is \"loud, cartoonish, and misanthropic, but... remarkably well-suited for our fraught present moment\".<ref name=\"Ringer\"/> David Johansen's [[New York Dolls]] bandmate [[Arthur Kane]] was sent into a jealous rage after seeing Johansen's prominent role in ''Scrooged''.
