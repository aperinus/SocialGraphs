The short was also one of most watched television specials in the United Kingdom in 2008, and received critical acclaim. It received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Short Film at the [[82nd Academy Awards]] losing to ''[[Logorama]]'' and won a [[BAFTA]] and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Short Animation and Best Animated Short Subject respectively in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[serial killer]] has murdered twelve bakers. While on a delivery for their bakery business, Wallace and Gromit save Piella Bakewell, a former [[pin-up girl]] for the Bake-O-Lite bread company, and her nervous poodle Fluffles when the brakes on her bicycle fail. Gromit finds there is no problem with the brakes, but Wallace is smitten. He and Piella begin a whirlwind romance, and Gromit is angered when she redecorates their house. Fluffles and Gromit share a sensitive moment when she returns Gromit's possessions, discarded by Piella.\n\nWallace sends Gromit to return Piella's forgotten purse. At Piella's mansion, Gromit discovers numbered [[mannequin]]s representing each of the murdered bakers, and a book of photos; Wallace is her planned thirteenth victim, completing a [[baker's dozen]]. When he shows Wallace the evidence, Wallace is too distracted with his engagement to Piella to listen.\n\nGromit installs security measures in their home, including a metal-detecting security screener. After Piella tricks Wallace into thinking that Gromit bit her '''('''''she bit her own arm''''')''', Wallace muzzles Gromit and chains him up. Gromit watches helplessly as Piella prepares to push Wallace to his death, but he is saved when Piella is struck by a bag of flour. After an angry outburst about bakers, she leaves but drops by the next day to apologize with a cake. Gromit, suspicious, follows her home, where Piella throws him into a storeroom with Fluffles.\n\nEscaping in Piella's old Bake-O-Lite [[hot air balloon]], Gromit and Fluffles arrive at Wallace's house as he lights the candle. After a struggle, the cake falls, revealing to be a [[bomb]]. Wallace and Gromit are attacked by Piella, who reveals she detests bakers after her weight gain ended her career as the Bake-O-Lite girl. She is about to kill Wallace, but is attacked by Fluffles in a [[forklift]]. In the chaos, the bomb ends up in Wallace's trousers; Gromit and Fluffles neutralize the explosion by filling the trousers with dough while Piella leaps onto her balloon and escapes. However, her weight drags the balloon into the zoo and right to a crocodile enclosure where she is fatally devoured.\n\nDejected, Wallace and Gromit decide to take their mind off their great adventure, especially the battle they had with Piella, with a delivery. Outside, they find Fluffles and she joins them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Sallis]] as Wallace\n* [[Sally Lindsay]] as Piella Bakewell\n* Melissa Collier as Fluffles\n* Sarah Laborde as Bake-O-Lite singer\n* [[Ben Whitehead]] as Baker Bob (uncredited)\n* [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Miss Thripp (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2007, it was announced that ''Wallace and Gromit'' were to return to television after an absence of ten years with a new short film titled ''Wallace and Gromit: Trouble At' Mill''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/wallace-gromit-return/|title=Wallace And Gromit Return|publisher=empireonline.com|date=3 October 2007|access-date=13 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/wallace-and-gromit-to-return-in-the-trouble-at-mill/|title = Wallace and Gromit to Return in the Trouble at Mill|date = 3 October 2007}}</ref> Filming began in January 2008; creator Nick Park commented that the production period for the short was significantly quicker than that of the feature-length films ''[[Chicken Run]]'' and ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit|The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', which each took five years to complete.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name=\"bbc2\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/03/wallace.shtml|title=The latest Wallace And Gromit outing comes to BBC One this Christmas}}</ref> ''A Matter of Loaf and Death'' was the first Aardman film to be made using the software Stop-Motion Pro.
