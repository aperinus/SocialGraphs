Directed and co-written by [[Franco Zeffirelli]], the film stars [[Leonard Whiting]] as [[Romeo]] and [[Olivia Hussey]] as [[Juliet]]. [[Laurence Olivier]] spoke the film's prologue and epilogue and dubs the voice of the actor [[Antonio Pierfederici]], who played Lord Montague, but was not credited on-screen. The cast also stars [[Milo O'Shea]], [[Michael York]], [[John McEnery]], [[Bruce Robinson]], and [[Robert Stephens]].\n\nThe most financially successful film adaptation of a Shakespeare play at the time of its release, it was popular among teenagers partly because it was the first film to use actors who were close to the age of the characters from the original play. Several critics also welcomed the film enthusiastically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Adler|first=Renata|title=Movie Review \u2013 Romeo and Juliet (1968)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=EE05E7DF173EE571BC4153DFB6678383679EDE|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=9 March 2012|date=9 October 1968}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Romeo and Juliet|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19681015/REVIEWS/810150301/1023|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|access-date=9 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221023128/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19681015%2FREVIEWS%2F810150301%2F1023|archive-date=21 December 2007|date=15 October 1968|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Pasqualino De Santis]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] ([[Danilo Donati]]); it was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], making it the last Shakespearean film to be nominated for Best Picture to date. Whiting and Hussey both won [[Golden Globe Awards]] for Most Promising Newcomers.\n\n==Plot==\nOne summer morning in [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], a longstanding feud between the [[Montague family|Montague]] and the [[Capulet]] clans breaks out in a street brawl. The brawl is broken up by the [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Prince Escalus|Prince]], who warns both families that any future violence between them will result in harsh consequences.  That night, two teenagers of the two families\u2014[[Romeo]] and [[Juliet]]\u2014meet at a Capulet masked ball and fall in love. Later, Romeo stumbles into the secluded garden under Juliet's bedroom balcony and the two exchange impassioned pledges.  They are secretly married the next day by Romeo's confessor and father figure, [[Friar Laurence]], with the assistance of Juliet's nurse.\n\nThat afternoon, Juliet's cousin [[Tybalt]], furious that Romeo had attended his family's ball, insults him and challenges him to a brawl.  Romeo now regards Tybalt as family and he refuses to fight him, which leads Romeo's best friend, [[Mercutio]], to fight Tybalt instead. Despite Romeo's efforts to stop the fight, Tybalt mortally wounds Mercutio, who curses both the Montague and Capulet houses before dying.  Enraged over his friend's death, Romeo retaliates by fighting Tybalt and killing him.  Romeo is subsequently punished by the Prince with banishment from Verona, with the threat of death if he ever returns. Romeo then secretly spends his wedding night with Juliet, and the couple [[Consummation|consummate]] their marriage before Romeo flees.\n\nJuliet's parents, unaware of their daughter's secret marriage, have arranged for Juliet to marry wealthy [[Count Paris]].  Juliet pleads with her parents to postpone the marriage, but they refuse and threaten to disown her. Juliet seeks out Friar Laurence for help, hoping to escape her [[arranged marriage]] to Paris and remain faithful to Romeo. At Friar Laurence's behest, she reconciles with her parents and agrees to their wishes. On the night before the wedding, Juliet consumes a potion prepared by Friar Laurence intended to make her appear dead for 42 hours.  Friar Laurence plans to inform Romeo of the hoax so that Romeo can meet Juliet after her burial and escape with her when she recovers from her swoon, so he sends Friar John to give Romeo a letter describing the plan.\n\nHowever, when Balthasar, Romeo's servant, sees Juliet being buried under the impression that she is dead, he goes to tell Romeo and reaches him before Friar John. In despair, Romeo goes to Juliet's tomb and kills himself by drinking poison.  Soon afterwards, Friar Laurence arrives as Juliet awakens. Despite his attempts to persuade her to flee from the crypt, Juliet refuses to leave Romeo, and once the Friar flees, she kills herself by plunging his dagger into her abdomen.  Later, the two families, having ended their feud, attend their joint funeral and are condemned by the Prince.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|Characters in Romeo and Juliet}}\n{{Col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-3}}\n;The House of Montague\n*[[Antonio Pierfederici]] as [[Lord Montague]]\n*Esmeralda Ruspoli as [[Lady Montague]]\n*[[Leonard Whiting]] as [[Romeo]]\n*[[Bruce Robinson]] as [[Benvolio]]\n*[[Keith Skinner]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Balthasar|Balthasar]]\n*Roberto Antonelli as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Abram|Abram]]\n{{col-3}}\n;The House of Capulet\n*[[Paul Hardwick]] as [[Lord Capulet]]\n*[[Natasha Parry]] as [[Lady Capulet]]\n*[[Olivia Hussey]] as [[Juliet]]\n*[[Michael York]] as [[Tybalt]]\n*[[Dyson Lovell]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Gregory and Sampson|Sampson]]\n*[[Richard Warwick]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Gregory and Sampson|Gregory]]\n*[[Pat Heywood]] as [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|The Nurse]]\n*[[Roy Holder]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Peter|Peter]]\n{{col-3}}\n;Others\n*[[John McEnery]] as [[Mercutio]]\n*[[Milo O'Shea]] as [[Friar Laurence]]\n*[[Robert Stephens]] as [[Characters in Romeo and Juliet#Prince|The Prince of Verona]]\n*[[Roberto Bisacco]] as [[Count Paris|Paris]]\n*[[Paola Tedesco]] as Rosaline ''(uncredited)''\n*[[Bruno Filippini]] as Leonardo, the singer ''(uncredited)''\n*[[Laurence Olivier]] as the chorus and voice of Lord Montague ''(uncredited)''\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Director-Franco-Zeffirelli-and-Olivia-Hussey-in-the-movie-Romeo-and-Juliet-391759001112.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franco Zeffirelli]] and [[Olivia Hussey]] while filming ''Romeo and Juliet'' in 1967]]\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n[[Paul McCartney]] has said he was considered by [[Franco Zeffirelli]] for the role of Romeo. Although Zeffirelli does not mention it in his autobiography, McCartney provided details on this account (including meeting with [[Olivia Hussey]] and exchanging telegrams with her) in his co-written autobiography.<ref>Du Noyer, Paul. Conversations with McCartney. New York: The Overlook Press. pg.: 138-139</ref> In April 2020, McCartney referred to his discussions with Zeffirelli on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]''.\n\nZeffirelli engaged in a worldwide search for unknown teenage actors to play the parts of the two lovers. [[Anjelica Huston]] was in the running for Juliet, but her father, the director [[John Huston]], withdrew her from consideration when he decided to cast her in his own film, ''[[A Walk with Love and Death]]''.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/b3UntQFFkNY Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20200229061504/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3UntQFFkNY Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3UntQFFkNY| title=Anjelica Huston with Joy Behar: Watch Me| author=92Y Plus| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2014-11-19| access-date=2019-05-08}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Leonard Whiting]] was 17 at the time, and [[Olivia Hussey]] was 15, and Zeffirelli adapted the play in such a way as to play to their strengths and hide their weaknesses: for instance, long speeches were trimmed, and he emphasized reaction shots.<ref name=tcmart>Landazuri, Margarita [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/452861/Romeo-and-Juliet/articles.html \"Romeo and Juliet (1968)\"] [[TCM.com]]</ref>\n\nLaurence Olivier's involvement in the production was by happenstance. He was in [[Rome]] to film ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'' and visited the studio where ''Romeo and Juliet'' was being shot. He asked Zeffirelli if there was anything he could do, and was given the Prologue to read, then ended up dubbing the voice of Lord Montague as well as other assorted minor roles.<ref name=tcmart />\n\n===Filming locations===\nThe film is set in a [[14th century]] [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] and filmed in varying locations:<ref>Liner notes (back cover) from ''Romeo & Juliet: Original Soundtrack Recording'', 1968, [[Capitol Records]] ST 2993</ref>\n*The balcony scene: at the [[Palazzo Borghese]], built by [[Cardinal Scipione Borghese]] in the [[16th century]], in [[Artena]], 40&nbsp;km southeast of [[Rome]].\n*The interior church scenes: at the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of [[San Pietro, Tuscania]] in the town of [[Tuscania]], 90&nbsp;km northwest of Rome.\n*The [[tomb]] scene: also in [[Tuscania]].\n*The palace of the Capulets' scenes: at [[Palazzo Piccolomini, Pienza|Palazzo Piccolomini]], built between 1459\u201362 by [[Pope Pius II]], in the city of [[Pienza]], in [[Siena]] province.\n*The duelling scenes with swords were filmed in the old [[Umbria]]n town of [[Gubbio]].\n*The film also has some scenes filmed in [[Montagnana]].\n*The street scenes: Also in [[Pienza]], and on the [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]] backlot, Rome.\n\n=== Editing ===\nDuring [[post-production]], several scenes were trimmed or cut.

This version has been recorded by [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Andy Williams]] and [[Shirley Bassey]] for her 1968 album ''[[This Is My Life (Shirley Bassey album)|This is My Life]]''. [[Josh Groban]] performed \"Un Giorno Per Noi\", an [[Italy|Italian]] version of \"A Time for Us\".

Said Yorke, \"I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13, and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. The song is written for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts.

Cory's parents then phone Topanga's parents who in turn send Topanga's Aunt Prudence, who lives in Philadelphia, to pick her up. Cory tells Topanga that maybe Aunt Prudence \"will be on our side.... Maybe she'll realize that we're Romeo and Juliet, we belong together.\" Topanga tells him that \"my aunt has never been in love, never been married and wouldn't even know who Romeo and Juliet were.\" Then Aunt Prudence enters the room, played by Olivia Hussey.\n*Japanese [[manga]] artist [[Rumiko Takahashi]] referenced the Zeffirelli film in two of her manga and [[anime]] works. In one episode of ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', Ryoko Mendou invites series protagonist [[Ataru Moroboshi]] to have a \"Romeo and Juliet\"-style rendezvous with her, and wears a dress based on Hussey's from the film. Later, Takahashi's ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]'' featured a storyline in which the lead characters, [[Ranma Saotome]] and [[Akane Tendo]], are cast as Romeo and Juliet in a production of the play at their high school. Takahashi designed Ranma and Akane's costumes for the play with Whiting and Hussey's outfits in the Zeffirelli film in mind.<ref>The storyline spans chapters 74 through 77 of the manga and episode 39 of the anime titled ''Kissing Is Such Sweet Sorrow!
