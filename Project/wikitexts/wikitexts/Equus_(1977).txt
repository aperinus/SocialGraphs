The film stars [[Richard Burton]], [[Peter Firth]], [[Colin Blakely]], [[Joan Plowright]], [[Eileen Atkins]], and [[Jenny Agutter]]. The story concerns a psychiatrist treating a teenager who has blinded horses in a stable, attempting to find the root of his [[horse worship]].\n\nLumet's translation of the acclaimed play to a cinematic version incorporated some realism, in the use of real horses as opposed to human actors, and a graphic portrayal of the blinding. Despite some criticism of this approach, the film received positive reviews, with awards for Burton, Firth and Agutter.\n\n==Plot==\nHesther Salomon, a magistrate, asks her platonic friend Martin Dysart, a disillusioned [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] who works with disturbed teenagers at a hospital in [[Hampshire]], England, to treat a 17-year-old stable boy named Alan Strang after he blinded six horses with a [[sickle]]. With Alan only singing [[television advertisement|TV commercial jingles]], Martin goes to see the boy's parents, the non-religious Frank Strang and his [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] wife Dora. She had taught her son the basics of sex and that God sees all, but the withdrawn Alan replaced his mother's deity with a god he called Equus, incarnated in horses. Frank discloses to Martin that he witnessed Alan late at night in his room, haltered and [[flagellation|flagellating]] himself, as he chanted a series of names in [[Genealogy of Jesus|Biblical genealogy]]-fashion which culminated in the name Equus as he climaxed.\n\nMartin begins winning the respect and confidence of Alan, who shares his earliest memory of a horse from when he was six and a man approached him on a horse named Trojan. Alan imagined the horse spoke to him, and said his true name was Equus, and this was the name of all horses. The man took Alan up on Trojan, which the boy found thrilling, but his parents reacted negatively and injured him taking him off the horse. Martin also meets the stable manager, who reveals Alan secured his job through another employee, Jill. Devastated at the horses' injuries she indirectly caused, Jill has taken medical leave.\n\nEventually, Alan admits to Martin that he would secretly take horses away from the stables at night to ride them nude, chanting prayers to Equus until he reached orgasm, after which he caressed them lovingly. Martin envies the boy's passionate paganism, in comparison to his own empty life, where he has ceased intimacies with his wife and is plagued by nightmares of ritualistically slaughtering children in [[Homer]]'s Greece, wearing the [[Mask of Agamemnon]]. Given an aspirin serving as a [[placebo]] \"[[truth serum|truth drug]]\", Alan further reveals that one evening Jill tempted him to go to a Swedish pornographic film at a local cinema, where he was shocked to see his father, who forced him to leave the cinema. After Alan went back with Jill to the stables, she stripped and offered him sex but he was unable to perform and, although she was sympathetic, told her to leave. Naked, and tormented that Equus sees all and is a jealous god, he blinded the horses.\n\nMartin is left troubled by the fact that he can treat Alan to take away his pain but in the process will deprive the boy of his passion, leaving him as emotionally neutered as Martin himself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Dr. Martin Dysart\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Alan Strang\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Frank Strang\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Dora Strang\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as Harry Dalton\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Hesther Saloman\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Jill Mason\n* [[Kate Reid]] as Margaret Dysart\n* [[John Wyman (actor)|John Wyman]] as Horseman\n* [[Frazier Mohawk]] as the Ringmaster\n* Elva Mai Hoover as Miss Raintree\n* Ken James as Mr. Pearce\n* David Gardner as Dr. Bennett\n* James Hurdle as Mr. Davies\n* Sheldon Rybowski as Child\n* [[Brook Williams]] as Art\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector [[Sidney Lumet]] saw the play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' when it was first performed in London between 1973 and 1975, and also saw productions with [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Richard Burton]].{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=74}} Lumet found that Perkins' performance was excellent, but felt the stage productions failed to capture the conflict of the character Martin Dysart, which he believed was meant to represent writer [[Peter Shaffer]]'s inner turmoil.{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=74}}\n\nShaffer and Lumet spent more than one year preparing the screenplay before filming began.{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=76}} Much of the dialogue in Shaffer's play is preserved, accurately, in the screenplay.{{sfn|Erskine|Welsh|2000|p=111}}\n\n[[Marlon Brando]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] were considered for the part of Dysart in the film version. However, Burton's stage performance won over audiences, despite concerns about his [[alcoholism]].<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17106/Equus/articles.html |title=Equus (1977) |last=Smith |first=Richard Harland |access-date=24 October 2016|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nIn stage productions, the horses are portrayed by human actors, often heavily built, athletic men wearing tribal-style masks.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Lumet did not believe this could adequately be done in a film version, concluding a degree of realism was required, \"because the reality he [Alan] was being watched in was going to create the dilemma within him\".{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=75}} For horse-related stunts, the filmmakers consulted [[Yakima Canutt]], who had previously worked on almost all of [[John Wayne]]'s early [[Western (genre)|western films]].{{sfn|Barlow|2008|p=301}} The horse riding and blinding scenes were shot initially in natural light before moving to unrealistic lighting, to capture conflicting [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] world views.{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=75}} With cinematographer [[Oswald Morris]] and production designer [[Tony Walton]], Lumet developed a complex colour scheme avoiding easily identifiable colours, preferring to combine colours to emphasise duality.{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|pp=75-76}}\n\nThe scene where Firth rides the horse nude was filmed in one take, in an uninterrupted shot lasting four and a half minutes.{{sfn|Cunningham|2001|p=30}} Whereas the blinding scene was done in [[Mime artist|pantomime]] on stage, Lumet opted to graphically display it to convey the horror. Much of the footage shot depicted the horses' heads morphing into faces of [[Jesus]], Dora Strang and Frank Strang, and a glimpse of a [[Blakas|Balinese dagger]]. However, Lumet decided this was unsubtle and cut much of this, only keeping the dagger to portray ancient impulses.{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=76}}\n\nDespite being a British and American production set in [[Hampshire]], England, filming took place entirely in and around [[Ontario, Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/55907|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> The scenes in the stable and Alan's room were filmed in the [[Toronto International Film Studio]] in [[Kleinburg]], while downtown Hampshire was doubled with [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]] and [[Halton Hills]].{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=77}} The Strang family house was a real house located in the [[Toronto]] suburb of [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]]. The film was produced during the height of the \"tax shelter era\" of Canadian filmmaking, in which foreign producers flocked to the country in order to take advantage of the [[Capital Cost Allowance]] which allowed investors to deduct up to a 100% of a film's budget provided it met certain requirements. That, combined with the value of the [[Canadian dollar]] and abundance of cheaper crew and locations than those found abroad, led to a boom period in Canadian filmmaking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/tax-shelter-films|title=Tax Shelter Films {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n[[File:Richard Burton 1971.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Richard Burton]] received positive reviews for his performance and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].]]\nLumet acknowledged that the film was \"very vulnerable to attack\", and critics were bound to ask why a film was needed when the play was \"perfect\", but initial reviews were \"respectful\".{{sfn|Applebaum|2006|p=74}} [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two and a half stars, arguing the realism in actual horses and their blinding, \"strangely enough, get in the way of the play's own reality: the obsession that the two characters come to share\"; however, Ebert complimented Burton and Firth on their performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/equus-1977 |title=Equus |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=9 November 1977 |access-date=23 October 2016|work=Rogerebert.com}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]], chief critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that he preferred the theatricality of the stage production, but \"Now, after seeing Sidney Lumet's comparatively realistic film version, it's possible to appreciate Mr. Shaffer's text for what it is\u2014 an extraordinarily skillful, passionate inquiry into the entire Freudian method\". Canby also found the movie's realism excessive, and said that \"the movie exhausts us with information\", specifically citing the scene where Alan rides a horse bareback as giving the viewers \"anticlimactic detail\". Canby also concluded \"This is the best Burton performance since ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
