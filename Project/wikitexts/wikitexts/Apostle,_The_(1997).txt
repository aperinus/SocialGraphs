[[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[June Carter Cash]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Billy Joe Shaver]] also appear. It was filmed on location in and around [[Saint Martinville]] and [[Des Allemands, Louisiana]] with some establishing shots done in the [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] area by a second unit before principal photography began. The majority of the film was filmed in Sunset, Louisiana and Lafayette, Louisiana.\n\nThe film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10323/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Apostle |access-date=2009-10-03|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> For his performance, Duvall was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. The film won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] for 1997.\n\n== Plot ==\nEuliss F. \"Sonny\" Dewey (Duvall) is a [[charismatic (movement)|charismatic]] [[Pentecostal]] [[preacher]]. His wife Jessie (Fawcett) has begun an adulterous relationship with a youth minister named Horace. She refuses Sonny's desire to reconcile, although she assures him that she will not interfere with his right to see his children. She has also conspired to use their church's bylaws to have him removed from power. Sonny asks God what to do but receives no answer. Much of the congregation sides with Jessie in this dispute. Sonny, however, refuses to start a new church, insisting that the one which forced him out was \"his\" church. At his child's [[Little League]] game, Sonny, in an emotional and drunken fit, attacks Horace with a bat and puts him into a coma; Horace later dies.\n\nA fleeing Sonny ditches his car in a river and gets rid of all identifying information. After destroying all evidence of his past, Sonny rebaptizes himself and anoints himself as \"The Apostle E. F.\" He leaves Texas and ends up in the [[bayou]]s of Louisiana, where he persuades a retired minister named Blackwell (Beasley) to help him start a new church. He works various odd jobs and uses the money to build the church, and to buy time to preach on a local radio station. Sonny also begins dating the station's receptionist (Richardson).\n\nWith Sonny's energy and charisma, the church soon has a faithful and racially integrated flock. Sonny even succeeds in converting a racist construction worker (Thornton) who shows up at a church picnic intent on destruction. While at work in a local diner, Sonny sees his new girlfriend out in public with her husband and children, apparently reconciled. Sonny walks out, vowing never to return there.\n\nJessie hears a radio broadcast of the Apostle E. F. and calls the police on Sonny. The police show up in the middle of an evening service but allow Sonny to finish it while they wait outside. In the poignant finale, Sonny delivers an impassioned sermon before telling his flock that he has to go. In the final scene, Sonny, now part of a [[chain gang]], preaches to the inmates as they work along the side of a highway.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Duvall]] \u2013 Euliss F. \"Sonny\" Dewey\n* [[Farrah Fawcett]] \u2013 Jessie Dewey\n* [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] \u2013 Brother C.

He eventually decided to direct and finance it himself. The film was shot in different areas of Texas and Louisiana. The fictional town of Bayou Boutte is actually a small town in Louisiana called Sunset. The film was first screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Thirty minutes into the screening, studio executives began leaving the theater to wheel and deal outside; [[October Films]] gained the distribution rights that night. The film went on to acquire a $21.3 million worldwide theatrical gross, with a combined production and advertising budget of $8 million.<ref name=Numb/>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture The Apostle\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 10, 1998\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Country music|Country]]<br />[[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]]<br />[[Southern Gospel]]\n| length     = 50:30\n| label      = [[Rising Tide Records|Rising Tide]]\n| producer   = [[Robert Duvall]]<br />[[Scott Greenstein]]<br /><small>(executive producers)</small>\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r333977|first=Thom|last=Owens}}</ref>\n| rev2      = \n| rev2Score = \n}}\nThe score for ''The Apostle'' was scored by [[David Mansfield]].
