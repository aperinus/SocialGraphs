During August and September 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists staged an expedition to the [[wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the RMS ''Titanic'']] and dived in Russian deep-submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone had before. With the help of two small, purpose-built [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated vehicles]], nicknamed [[The Blues Brothers|\"Jake\" and \"Elwood\"]], the audience too can see inside the ''Titanic'', and with the help of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], audiences can view the ship's original appearance superimposed on the deep-dive images.\n\nAlso along for the ride Cameron invited his friend, actor [[Bill Paxton]], who played Brock Lovett in the [[Titanic (1997 film)|1997 film]].

Part of the film was filmed in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada.\n\n[[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] lead singer and songwriter Glen Phillips contributed the opening track, \"Departure\". James Cameron loved the band's 1991 track \"Nightingale Song\" but found Columbia Records' licensing fee too high (it wanted over $5,000 for the use of the one minute he wanted to use) so he contacted the band's management hoping they could re-record it for his film, only to find they had broken up in 1998 and could not. However, during the negotiations Cameron asked if Phillips would be interested in writing a new track in the spirit of the older song and \"Departure\" was created. it was produced, mixed, and all instruments played by Phillips in his garage studio though this was not credited in the CD booklet.\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 58:29\n| extra_column = Vocalist\n| all_music = Joel McNeely, except where noted\n| extra1 = [[Glen Phillips (singer)|Glen Phillips]]\n| title1 = Departure\n| music1 = Glen Phillips\n| length1 = 2:33\n| title2 = Main Title\n| length2 = 1:16\n| title3 = Apprehension\n| length3 = 1:29\n| title4 = Getting Ready\n| length4 = 1:20\n| title5 = Titanic Revealed\n| length5 = 3:11\n| title6 = Floating Above the Deck\n| length6 = 3:01\n| title7 = Dangerous Recovery\n| length7 = 1:28\n| title8 = Valse Septembre\n| music8 = [[Felix Godin]]\n| length8 = 2:19\n| title9 = The Windows\n| length9 = 0:47\n| title10 = Jake and Elwood\n| length10 = 2:14\n| title11 = The Bots Go In\n| length11 = 1:33\n| title12 = Titsy Bitsy Girl\n| music12 = [[Ivan Caryll]] and [[Lionel Monckton]]\n| length12 = 1:52\n| title13 = The Grand Staircase\n| length13 = 1:33\n| title14 = Exploring the Staterooms\n| length14 = 1:51\n| title15 = Song Without Words\n| music15 = [[Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]\n| length15 = 2:26\n| title16 = Elegance Past\n| length16 = 2:10\n| title17 = Building the Ship\n| length17 = 1:28\n| title18 = I...
