Produced on a $10&nbsp;million budget, it earned over $128&nbsp;million.\n\nThe film is about an airport manager trying to keep his airport open during a snowstorm, while a suicide bomber plots to blow up a [[Boeing 707]] airliner in flight. It takes place at fictional Lincoln International Airport near [[Chicago]]. The film was a commercial success and surpassed ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' as [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]' biggest moneymaker.<ref name=\"Universal City\">{{cite book |last1=Link |first1=Tom |title=Universal City-North Hollywood: A Centennial Portrait |year=1991 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Chatsworth, California |isbn=0-89781-393-6 |page=87}}</ref> The movie won [[Helen Hayes]] an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway and was nominated for nine other Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for designer [[Edith Head]].\n\nWith attention paid to the detail of day-to-day airport and airline operations, the plot concerns the response to a paralyzing snowstorm, environmental concerns over [[noise pollution]], and an attempt to blow up an airliner. The film is characterized by personal stories intertwining while decisions are made minute-by-minute by the airport and airline staffs, operations and maintenance crews, flight crews, and [[Federal Aviation Administration]] air traffic controllers.\n\n[[Ernest Laszlo]] photographed it in 70&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]]. It is the last film scored by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] and the last film roles of [[Van Heflin]] and [[Jessie Royce Landis]]. It was also Ross Hunter's last film produced for Universal after a 17-year tenure.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Chicago]] area is paralyzed by a snowstorm affecting Lincoln International Airport. A Trans Global Airlines (TGA) [[Boeing 707]] flight crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway, becoming stuck in the snow and closing that runway. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife, Cindy. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, TGA customer relations agent Tanya Livingston.\n\nVernon Demerest is a TGA [[Pilot licensing and certification#Airline Transport Pilot|captain]] scheduled to be the [[checkride]] captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during TGA Flight 2 to Rome. TGA's flagship international service, named ''The Golden Argosy'', is being operated with a Boeing 707. Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld's sister, Sarah, he is secretly having an affair with Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child.\n\nBakersfeld borrows [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] mechanic Joe Patroni to assist with moving TGA's disabled plane blocking Runway 29. Bakersfeld and Tanya also deal with Ada Quonsett, an elderly widow from [[San Diego]] who is a habitual [[stowaway]] on various airlines.\n\nDemolition expert D.O. Guerrero, down on his luck and with a history of [[mental illness]], buys both a one-way TGA ticket aboard TGA Flight 2 and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane. He plans to set off a bomb in an attach\u00e9 case while over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect the insurance money of $225,000 (${{format price|{{Inflation|US|225000|1970|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}). His erratic behavior at the airport, including using his last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a [[U.S. Customs]] officer for an airline gate agent, attracts airport officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs airport officials that he had been fired from a construction job for \"misplacing\" explosives and that the family's financial situation is dire.\n\nAda Quonsett manages to evade the TGA employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles. Enchanted by the idea of a trip to Rome, she talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2, and happens to sit next to Guerrero. When Flight 2's crew is made aware of Guerrero's presence and possible intentions, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once Ada is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew to get to Guerrero's briefcase, but the ploy fails when a troublesome passenger interferes and returns the case to Guerrero.\n\nDemerest goes back into the passenger cabin and tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy has been nullified. Guerrero briefly moves to give Demerest the bomb, but just then another passenger exits the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft, and the same troublesome passenger yells out that Guerrero has a bomb. Guerrero runs into the lavatory and sets off the bomb, dying instantly and blowing a three-foot hole in the fuselage. Gwen, just outside the door, is injured in the explosion and subsequent [[explosive decompression]], but the pilots retain control of the airplane.\n\nWith all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather, Flight 2 returns to Lincoln for an [[emergency landing]]. Due to the bomb damage, Demerest demands the airport's longest runway, Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Bakersfeld orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows, despite the costly damage they would do to it. Patroni, who is \"taxi-qualified\" on 707s, has been trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Demerest's damaged aircraft to land. By exceeding the 707's engine operating parameters, Patroni frees the stuck jet without damage, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled TGA Flight 2 to land.\n\nAs the shaken passengers exit the plane, a hysterical Inez searches in vain for her dead husband. Demerest's wife sees him accompanying Gwen's stretcher as he says he'll go with her to the hospital. Bakersfield and Tanya leave together, heading to her apartment for much needed rest and breakfast.\n\nIn a brief [[epilogue]], Ada is enjoying her reward of free first-class travel on TGA. But as she arrives at the gate, she laments that it was \"much more fun the other way.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per 13 \"Starring\" and 5 \"Co-starring\" (lengthy 18 total) in tombstone opening credits, \"Starring\" roles per closing credits scroll, \"Co-starring\" roles per dialogue --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Mel Bakersfeld, airport manager at Lincoln International Airport near [[Chicago]]\n* [[Dean Martin]] as Vernon Demerest, [[FAA Practical Test|checkride]] captain on Trans Global Airlines (TGA) Flight 2, Bakersfeld's brother-in-law\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as Tanya Livingston, head customer relations agent for TGA, widow, Bakersfeld's future mistress\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on TGA Flight 2\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Joe Patroni, chief mechanic for Trans World Airlines at Lincoln International, called on by Bakersfeld\n* [[Helen Hayes]] as Ada Quonsett, an elderly stowaway\n* [[Van Heflin]] as D.

A display in the terminal, with stills from the field and the film, says: \"Minnesota's legendary winters attracted Hollywood here in 1969, when portions of the film ''Airport'' were shot in the terminal and on the field. The weather remained stubbornly clear, however, forcing the director to use plastic 'snow' to create the appropriate effect.\"\n\nThe set built representing the interior of the 707 was left standing at Universal Studios and was eventually joined with the 747 interior set constructed for ''[[Airport 1975]]'' on \"Stage 747.\" Both sets were used extensively in other Universal films and television series. The 707 set was used, for instance, in [[The Andromeda Strain (film)|''The Andromeda Strain'']] and on series like [[Ironside (1967 TV series)|''Ironside'']]. The sets were removed around 2002 and the space converted into a workshop.\n\nOnly one [[Boeing 707]] was used: a model 707-349C ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|N|324F}}) leased from [[Flying Tiger Line]]. It sported an [[El Al]] [[cheatline]] over its bare metal finish, with the fictional Trans Global Airlines (TGA) titles and tail. This aircraft later crashed on March 21, 1989 during approach into [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] while in service as cargo flight [[Transbrasil Flight 801]], killing all three crew members and 22 persons on the ground.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19890321-0 | title=Accident description PT-TCS | publisher=Aviation Safety Network | access-date=14 July 2011 | archive-date=12 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012150856/http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19890321-0 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Airport'' was released on May 29, 1970.
