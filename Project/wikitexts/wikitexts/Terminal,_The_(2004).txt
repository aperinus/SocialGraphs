The film is about an [[Eastern Europe]]an man who is stuck in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]] terminal when he is denied entry to the United States and at the same time is unable to return to his native country because of a military [[coup]].\n\nThe film is partially inspired by the true story of the 18-year stay of [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]] in Terminal 1 of [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]], France, from 1988 to 2006.<ref name=CSM062104>{{cite web|first=Ethan|last=Gilsdorf|title=Behind 'The Terminal,' a true story|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0621/p11s02-almo.html|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=June 21, 2004|access-date=December 5, 2010}}</ref> In 1988, Nasseri flew from Brussels to London via Paris; however, he was sent back to Paris because he lost his refugee passport.

Due to a lack of suitable airports willing to provide their facilities for the production, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the [[Palmdale Regional Airport|LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]], with most of the film's exterior shots taken from the [[Montr\u00e9al\u2013Mirabel International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Terminal (2004) - Filming & Production |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/locations |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in North America on June 18, 2004, to generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, earning $219 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nViktor Navorski, a traveler from the fictional country of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and learns that a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] has occurred back home. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia's new government, and Viktor is not permitted to enter the United States or return home as his passport is no longer considered valid. Because of this, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] seize his passport and return ticket pending resolution of the issue. He becomes a refugee and is forced to live at the airport.\n\nFrank Dixon, the Acting Field Commissioner of the airport, instructs Viktor to stay in the transit lounge until the issue is resolved. Viktor settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a [[Planters]] peanut can. Viktor finds a gate currently under renovation and makes it his home. All the while, Dixon is determined to get Viktor out of the airport and make him someone else's problem. He tries to get Viktor to leave by luring him out of the airport by ordering guards away from the exit for five minutes, but it fails. Dixon then tries to get Viktor to claim asylum if he is fearful of returning home, so he can leave the airport, but it also fails due to Viktor claiming that he is not scared of his own country. Meanwhile, Viktor befriends and assists several airport employees and travelers. Among them is a [[flight attendant]] named Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo after she mistakes him for a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Dixon, who is being considered for a promotion, becomes more and more obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. In the meantime, Viktor begins reading books and magazines to learn English. After he impulsively remodels a wall in the renovation zone, he is hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table.\n\nOne day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions her regarding Viktor and his mysterious peanut can. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the \"[[A Great Day in Harlem (photograph)|A Great Day in Harlem]]\" photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] newspaper in 1958 and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist [[Benny Golson]]. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.\n\nAfter nine months, his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he can get a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Meanwhile, Amelia had asked her \"friend\", actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair, to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn that she has rekindled her relationship with the man during this process. When he presents the emergency visa at customs, Viktor is told that Dixon must sign the visa. But with Viktor's passport now valid again, Dixon is determined to immediately send him back to Krakozhia. He threatens Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will cause trouble for his friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta Rajan back to [[India]] to face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane which would take Viktor back home, ensuring his deportation and taking the burden off Viktor.\n\nThe delay gives Viktor enough time to get into the city. Dixon orders his officers to arrest Viktor, but disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly smile and make eye contact. Dixon himself arrives at the taxi stand only moments after Viktor's taxi has left. When his officers arrive and one suggests immediately cordoning off the area and searching all vehicles to find him, Dixon, having had a change of heart, tells them that they have incoming travelers to handle. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. He gets in a taxi, telling the driver, \"I am going home\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Viktor Navorski\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Amelia Warren\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Frank Dixon\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Joe Mulroy\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Enrique Cruz\n* [[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Judge Thurman\n* [[Kumar Pallana]] as Gupta Rajan\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Dolores Torres\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Richard Salchak\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as Karl Iverson\n* [[Corey Reynolds]] as Waylin\n* [[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo Diaz]] as Bobby Alima\n* [[Rini Bell]] as Nadia\n* [[Valery Nikolaev]] as Milodragovich\n* [[Michael Nouri]] as Max\n* [[Benny Golson]] as himself\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Cab Driver Goran\n* [[Scott Adsit]] as Cab Driver\n* [[Dan Finnerty]] as Cliff\n* [[Stephen Mendel]] as First Class Steward\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Airportset2w.jpg|right|thumb|The gigantic airport set built for the film.]]\nSome have noted that the film appears to be inspired by the story of [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]], also known as Sir Alfred, an [[Iran]]ian [[refugee]] who lived in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris from 1988 when his refugee papers were stolen until 2006 when he was hospitalized for unspecified ailments.<ref name=CSM062104 /><ref>Duncan Walker, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3570850.stm \"Life in the lounge\"], BBC News Online Magazine, August 17, 2004.</ref> In September 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Spielberg bought the rights to Nasseri's life story as the basis for the film; and in September 2004 ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted Nasseri received thousands of dollars from the filmmakers.<ref name=NYT092103>Matthew Rose, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/magazine/magazinespecial/MFMERHANT.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5007&en=360b6f8f63635c6a&ex=1379476800 \"Waiting For Spielberg\"], ''The New York Times'', September 21, 2003.

''The Terminal'' set was built in a massive hangar at the [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]]. The hangar, part of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Plant 42]] complex was used to build the [[Rockwell International]] [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B bomber]]. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]]. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross-section of an aircraft wing. Because of this design, the film was one of the first to use the [[Spidercam]] for film production. The camera, most often used for televised sports, allowed Spielberg the ability to create sweeping shots across the set. The design of the set for ''The Terminal'', as noted by [[Roger Ebert]] in his reviews and attested by Spielberg himself in a feature by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, was greatly inspired by [[Jacques Tati]]'s classic film ''[[PlayTime]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} \n\nTom Hanks based his characterization of Viktor Navorski on his father-in-law Allan Wilson, a Bulgarian immigrant, who according to Hanks can speak \"Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, little bit of Italian, little bit of French\", in addition to his native Bulgarian.<ref>\"Season 12 Episode 9.\" ''Inside the Actors Studio''.
