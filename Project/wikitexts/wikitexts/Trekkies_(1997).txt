Verniere suggested that ''Trekkies'' wasn't as definitive as the film ''[[Free Enterprise (film)|Free Enterprise]]'' (1999) but described it as an \"interesting, often hilarious piece of sociological comedy\".<ref name=\"heraldreview\" /> Alicia Potter, also at the ''Boston Herald'', described the film as \"surreally funny\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Potter|first1=Alicia|title=Phasers on Fun: 'Trekkies' Catalogs Fan Worship|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-57112267.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701222316/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-57112267.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 1, 2018|access-date=March 8, 2016|work=[[Boston Herald]]|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]]|url-access=subscription |date=May 23, 1999}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 86% from 42 reviews with the consensus: \"To fan or not to fawn over: this lifelong and prosperous journey into a sometimes cringeworthy world makes ''Trekkies'' the lovable center of its universe.\"<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trekkies</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nIn 2004, a [[sequel]] was released, titled ''[[Trekkies 2]]''. This documentary travels throughout the world, mainly in [[Europe]], to show fans of ''Star Trek'' from outside the United States. It also revisits memorable fans featured in the previous film.\n\nNygard sought to answer some of the criticism received from Trekkies in the sequel, in that he was accused of not showing \"normal\" fans. With this in mind, he attempted to include some degree of a description of what was normal fan behaviour and what was more unusual.<ref name=\"deninterview\"/>\n\nIn an interview with TrekNews.net at the ''Star Trek Mission: New York'' convention in September 2016, Crosby talked about the potential for another documentary about ''Star Trek'':\n\n<blockquote>\nWe do want to make a Trekkies 3. In earnest, we\u2019re hoping to get started in two more years. We have to time it with the rights and all the legal stuff. There\u2019s a lot of politics involved. We approached CBS/Viacom/Paramount [who own various rights to Star Trek] already and there\u2019s interest. So fingers crossed. When producing these documentaries, I\u2019m always delighted by the surprise at something we didn\u2019t expect, such as the stories people tell and interacting with the fans, hearing stories. I never get tired of it...\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.treknews.net/2016/09/07/denise-crosby-trekkies-3-tng-star-trek-online/ |title = EXCLUSIVE: Denise Crosby Talks Trekkies 3, TNG, Star Trek Online |publisher = TrekNews.net |access-date = 2017-07-09}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Gerrold|first=David|title=The Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth, Sale and Final Production of one Episode|year=1973|edition=2004 BenBalla|publisher=BenBalla Books|location=Dallas, TX|ref=gerrold1973}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nemecek|first=Larry|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|year=2003|edition=3rd|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn= 0-7434-5798-6|ref=Nemecek2003}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.trekdoc.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{IMDb title|0120370|Trekkies}}\n* {{Amg title|160036|Trekkies}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|trekkies}}\n* {{Mojo title|trekkies}}\n{{Memoryalpha|Trekkies|''Trekkies''}}\n* [http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/18/1748226 Interview conducted by Slashdot with Roger Nygard]\n\n{{Star Trek}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about fandom]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Star Trek]]\n[[Category:Star Trek fandom]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
