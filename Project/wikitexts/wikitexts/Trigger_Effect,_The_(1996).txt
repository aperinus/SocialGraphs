The film follows the downward spiral of society during a widespread and lengthy [[power outage]] in [[Southern California]]. As Koepp's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the film was inspired by the 1978 documentary television series ''[[Connections (British documentary)|Connections]]'', and the 1960 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\", which starred Koepp's uncle, actor [[Claude Akins]]. \n\n''The Trigger Effect'' explores the idea that a simple power outage can potentially trigger a chain of largely unfavorable events, implying that modern society cannot live peacefully together without technology. Most of the film was shot in [[Los Angeles]], where Koepp was based at the time. The film grossed $3.6 million in a [[limited theatrical release]] in the United States and drew mixed reviews from critics, who highlighted its [[Surrealist cinema|surreal]] and enveloping style as well as the performances by the lead actors. Criticism was targeted at its safe and predictable ending. A novel based on the film and written by Dewey Gram was released in September 1996 by [[Berkley Books]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnnie and Matthew, a young married couple, find their infant daughter screaming with a high temperature and an [[earache]]. Matthew calls the doctor, who promises to phone in a prescription to the pharmacist the following day. During the night, the neighborhood wakes up due to a massive [[power outage]]. When Matthew visits the pharmacist the next day, he is unable to get the required medicine due to the blackout. Matthew steals the medicine when the pharmacist is not looking. Social unrest ensues due to the persistent blackout, leading Matthew and his wife's best friend, Joe, to buy a [[shotgun]].\n\nWhen an intruder breaks into the couple's house the following night, Matthew and Joe chase him outside, where a neighbor shoots the intruder. The neighbors conspire to cover up the fact that the deceased intruder was not armed. As the blackout continues for days over a large area, more chaos occurs. As a result, the group decides to flee to Annie's parents' house, 530 [[mile]]s away. They do not have enough fuel to travel the whole way, so they stop by an abandoned car hoping to siphon some. A man, Gary, is lying in the backseat. After Joe notices that Gary has a handgun, he heads back to their vehicle to get his own shotgun. Joe aims the shotgun at Gary to scare him off, but he shoots Joe and steals their vehicle.\n\nMatthew walks an hour to a farmhouse to try to get help for his family. The occupant, Raymond, refuses to help him initially, as he does not trust him. Matthew collects the shotgun and returns to the house, hoping to steal the car. He breaks in to get the car keys, and a standoff ensues between Raymond and him. When Raymond's young daughter enters the room, Matthew returns to civility, lowering his weapon. Raymond agrees to help Matthew, and soon afterwards Joe is loaded into an ambulance. Society returns to normal once the power returns, though Annie, Matthew and their neighbors are somewhat different from their experience.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Matthew\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Annie\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Joe\n* [[Richard T.

Making all those decisions by yourself can be a drag, you end up having long shouting matches with yourself.\"<ref name=\"FPH interview\"/> Actor [[Kyle MacLachlan]], who played Matthew, originally wanted to play Joe because he wanted to avoid a \"juvenile lead\", a role with which he strongly identified.<ref name=\"AV Club MacLachlan interview\"/> Nevertheless, he liked the script from the beginning and felt that playing a \"real guy\" with real emotions was \"fun\" for him, especially after playing unconventional roles in ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Showgirls]]''.<ref name=\"NewsOK interview\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n''The Trigger Effect'' invokes the idea that one simple event can potentially lead to social, racial and sexual issues, implying that humans cannot live peacefully together.<ref name=\"TWP review\"/> The film opens with a scene where two [[coyote]]s follow their animal instincts and eat fresh meat, as if humans were not animals themselves.<ref name=\"TWP review\"/> MacLachlan said that the film shows \"how quickly humanity would fall back into almost a tribal existence\" after a simple power outage,<ref name=\"AV Club MacLachlan interview\"/> while actor [[Dermot Mulroney]] noted that the film addresses inexplicable yet realistic behaviors between characters, such as mistrust between [[Black people|black]] and [[White people|white]] people, and issues regarding levels of education or personal achievement.<ref name=\"FPH interview\"/> Similarly, ''SplicedWire'' editor Rob Blackwelder interpreted it as \"a commentary on the underlying sense of danger and lack of trust that permeates American society.\"<ref name=\"Splicedwire review\"/> [[Resentment]] is another theme that is explored, as reflected in the scene where Matthew tells Joe it is more natural for him to buy a shotgun.<ref name=\"FPH interview\"/> The character played by actress [[Elisabeth Shue]], Annie, switches feelings for Matthew on and off. This, according to Shue, shows that a married woman with a comfortable life has as many desires, needs and pain, as a homeless person.<ref name=\"FPH interview\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Trigger Effect'' premiered at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] on May 16, 1996.<ref name=\"TCE\"/> It then had a [[limited theatrical release]] on August 30, 1996 in 524 theaters,<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> finishing 12th and grossing $1.9 million at the U.S. box office weekend.<ref name=\"LAT release\"/> The film's performance was considered a fair result for a limited release,<ref name=\"Weekly Variety\"/> and was compared to that of the comedy ''[[The Stupids (film)|The Stupids]]'', which had a wide release in the same weekend.<ref name=\"LAT release\"/> Overall, the film went on to make $3.6 million in North America.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> A novelization, authored by Dewey Gram, was released in September 1996 by [[Berkley Books]].<ref name=\"Novel\"/> ''The Trigger Effect'' was released on [[VHS]] in January 1997,<ref name=\"NYT VHS\"/> on [[DVD]] in July 1999,<ref name=\"Allmovie DVD\"/> and on [[Blu-ray]] in June 2019.<ref name=\"Blu-ray release\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nUpon release, ''The Trigger Effect'' received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"Metacritic Koepp\"/> Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', film critic [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] described ''The Trigger Effect'' as \"a sturdy and efficient [[Thriller film|thriller]]\",<ref name=\"EW review\"/> while Marc Savlov, writing for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', highlighted Koepp's ability to gradually increase the tension as the film progresses.<ref name=\"AC review\"/> The cast was generally praised,<ref name=\"NYT review\"/><ref name=\"Splicedwire review\"/><ref name=\"AC review\"/> particularly Shue, who Schwarzbaum singled out for retaining some of her \"effective ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'' disoriented languidness.\"<ref name=\"EW review\"/> Even so, film critic [[Richard von Busack]] felt that the film's characters \"never really engage the viewer\" despite their proficient performances.<ref name=\"TWP review\"/>\n\nThe ending was criticized for being safe and predictable, especially when compared to the riskier narrative prior to it.<ref name=\"Cincinnati Enquirer article\"/><ref name=\"TWP review\"/><ref name=\"EW review\"/> In his review for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, [[David Denby]] praised the first half of the film, stating that Koepp shows both a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] style, where tension is built through silences of routine domestic scenes, and elements of his collaboration with Spielberg.<ref name=\"NYM review\"/> According to Denby, \"the slightly bluish light scheme (the glam-fluorescent) and the images of suburban peace are reminiscent of Spielberg's mood of surreal wonder. This suburb, however, is just barely holding on to civilization.\"<ref name=\"NYM review\"/> Nevertheless, he felt that the second half of the film \"shifts into a predictable suburban-love-triangle potboiler\" and that the ending was \"as abrupt and thin as a TV show.\"<ref name=\"NYM review\"/>\n\nSome journalists criticized the film for the vagueness of its writing.<ref name=\"Metro review\"/><ref name=\"TWP review\"/> In his review for ''[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metro]]'', von Busack explained that, although the film offers some hints about Annie's past, the character is not fully developed, and felt that Matthew's relationship with Joe is not very clear.<ref name=\"Metro review\"/> Richard Harrington, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', criticized the fact that the film does not explain what caused the power outage and that the characters seem unimpressed about it.<ref name=\"TWP review\"/> This vagueness was highlighted by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' editor Ken Eisner, who acknowledged that Koepp's \"cool lensing, tight cutting and minimal use of music support this conceptual, if head-scratching approach\", describing ''The Trigger Effect'' as \"a bleak, highly stylized view of modern civilization.\"<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' agreed, stating that the film's enveloping style \"is haunting in its own powerful way.\"<ref name=\"NYT review\"/>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 72% from 25 reviews with the consensus: \"The Trigger Effect offers a captivating tale of paranoia and societal collapse, even if it runs out of thrills early on.\"<ref name=\"RT\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Novel\">{{cite book |title=The Trigger Effect |author=Dewey Gram |date=September 1996 |publisher=[[Berkley Books|Berkley]] |isbn=9781572972445}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Weekly Variety\">{{cite magazine |title='Crow' flies over weak B.O. field |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 9, 1996 |page=10}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NYM review\">{{cite magazine |title=He's Come Undone |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=David Denby |author-link=David Denby |pages=68, 72 |date=September 16, 1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-ECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 |access-date=February 18, 2018 |issn=0028-7369}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Cincinnati Enquirer article\">{{cite news |title='Trigger' almost hits bulls-eye |newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |date=August 30, 1996 |page=94 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/102215174/ |access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Metro review\">{{cite news |title=Class conflict in the dark fuels 'The Trigger Effect' |newspaper=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metro]] |publisher=[[Metro Newspapers]] |author=Richard von Busack |author-link=Richard von Busack |date=September 5, 1996 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.05.96/trigger-effect-9636.html |access-date=February 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007163611/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.05.96/trigger-effect-9636.html |archive-date=October 7, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBFC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/trigger-effect-1970-2 |title=Trigger Effect |website=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |access-date=February 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180227202431/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/trigger-effect-1970-2 |archive-date=February 27, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NYT review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05E3D91F39F933A0575BC0A960958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes |title=Urban Jitters Going Critical |date=August 30, 1996 |author=Janet Maslin |author-link=Janet Maslin |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509075949/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05E3D91F39F933A0575BC0A960958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes |archive-date=May 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FPH interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.freepresshouston.com/archive/2009/12/retro-interview-david-koepp-and-cast-of.html |title=Retro Interview: David Koepp and the cast of The Trigger Effect |date=December 20, 2009 |website=[[Free Press Houston]] |at=Film section |access-date=December 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307113333/http://www.freepresshouston.com/archive/2009/12/retro-interview-david-koepp-and-cast-of.html |archive-date=March 7, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AV Club Koepp interview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/david-koepp-1798208044 |title=David Koepp |date=August 9, 1999 |website=[[The A.V.
