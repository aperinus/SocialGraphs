It tells the story of an aging musical star who hopes a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show will restart his career. However, the play's director wants to make it a pretentious retelling of the  ''[[Faust]]'' legend and brings in a [[prima ballerina]] who clashes with the star. Along with ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), it is regarded as one of the finest [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] musicals, although it was a modest box-office success on first release.\n\nThe songs were written by the team of composer [[Arthur Schwartz]] and lyricist [[Howard Dietz]]. Schwartz was a prolific Hollywood composer who teamed with numerous lyricists over the years, while Dietz, a studio publicist, generally collaborated with Schwartz. Some of the songs in the film had been created for the original 1931 Broadway musical by Schwartz and Dietz, also titled ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]],'' with a book by [[George S. Kaufman]] and starring [[Fred Astaire]] and his sister [[Adele Astaire|Adele]]. The movie's dances and musical numbers were staged by [[Michael Kidd]].\n\nThe song \"[[That's Entertainment! (song)|That's Entertainment!]]\", which Schwartz and Dietz wrote specifically for the film, was a hit and has become a standard in popular music. Another song orchestrated by [[Conrad Salinger]], \"[[Dancing in the Dark (Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz song)|Dancing in the Dark]]\", is considered part of the [[Great American Songbook]] and was from the original Broadway production. Astaire's early number in the film, \"A Shine on Your Shoes\" was written for a 1932 Broadway revue with music and lyrics by Dietz and Schwartz titled ''[[Flying Colors (musical)|Flying Colors]]''. (It originally was performed by the dancing team of [[Buddy Ebsen|Buddy]] and [[Vilma Ebsen]]). In the movie version of ''The Band Wagon'', the song was reworked as a specialty number by jazz arranger [[Skip Martin]] to showcase all of Astaire's musical talents.<ref>Fordin, Hugh (1996). ''MGM Greatest Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit,'' Da Capo Press, NY, p. 409.</ref>\n\nThe musical director was [[Adolph Deutsch]] and the production was designed by [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]] working for the first time in motion pictures. The film was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design, Color]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Story and Screenplay]].\n\nScreenwriters [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], who received the nomination for the screenplay, patterned the film's characters Lester and Lily Marton after themselves; however, the fictional characters were a married couple, and Comden and Green were not romantically involved. The character of an overachieving impresario was developed with the successful producer-director-actor [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] in mind.<ref>Fordin, Hugh (1996). ''MGM Greatest Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit,'' Da Capo Press, NY, p. 401.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, ''The Band Wagon'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> In 2006, this film ranked #17 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of best musicals]].\n\n==Plot==\nTony Hunter, once a famous star of musical comedies on stage and later on screen, is largely forgotten after three years without a movie. He returns from Hollywood to New York. At [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], he is recognized but almost ignored by reporters who are there by chance as [[Ava Gardner]] is on the same train. However, he is greeted enthusiastically by his good friends Lester and Lily Marton, and they tell him they have written a stage show, a light musical comedy, that will be a perfect comeback for Tony. They will also act in it, and they already have caught the interest of Jeffrey Cordova, who they say can do anything: Currently he is starring in, as well as directing, a new adaptation of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' that he wrote based on the original Greek story.\n\nAs soon as Jeffrey hears Lily outline the play, he declares it to be a brilliant reinterpretation of the ''[[Faust]]'' legend, which should star Tony and himself as the characters corresponding to Faust and the Devil. The Martons are delighted that he will be acting as well as directing, but Tony is dubious about the ''Faust'' idea. Jeffrey declares that the boundaries between genres in the theater are artificial, and \"[[William Shakespeare|Bill Shakespeare]]\" and [[Bill Robinson]] are all parts of the same whole\u2014to prove his point, he leads the four in singing \"[[That's Entertainment! (song)|That's Entertainment!]]\" Tony agrees, and Jeffrey has the Martons rewrite the play as a dark, pretentious musical drama (when Lester also becomes dubious, Lily insists that one person must be in charge and Jeffrey can succeed at anything).\n\nJeffrey does succeed in arranging for the beautiful and talented ballerina Gabrielle \"Gaby\" Gerard to join the production, along with Paul Byrd, who is her boyfriend, choreographer, and manager\u2014even though he always insisted that a musical play would be beneath her. When Tony and Gaby meet, they become sarcastic and hostile to each other, but this is actually because they are insecure: Each of them feels much less talented than the other.\n\nEventually, it all proves too much for Tony, and he walks out. Gaby follows to meet him privately. In his hotel room, she comments that the paintings by famous artists on the wall are better reproductions than usual in a hotel; he says they are his own property, and are originals. She recognizes a painting of ballerinas as an early [[Edgar Degas|Degas]]. Tony and Gaby put their troubles aside, go for a horse-drawn carriage ride, dance together, and realize they can work together after all. They also begin to fall in love.\n\nWhen the first out-of-town tryout in New Haven proves disastrous, Tony demands that Jeffrey convert the production back into the light comedy that the Martons had envisioned. Jeffrey says that while they will have to find new backers because the original ones have walked out, he will be happy to appear in that show\u2014if Tony is in charge of it. Tony accepts, using his art collection to finance the production. <!-- There's mention of him selling the art, but he could also have ended up using it as collateral for a loan, so let's leave that non-explicit. --> Paul says the show is no longer suitable for Gaby and walks out, expecting her to follow, but she is pleased to stay and work with Tony.\n\nAfter some weeks on tour to perfect the new lighthearted musical numbers, the revised show proves to be a hit on its Broadway opening. Afterwards, Gaby and Tony kiss in front of the entire cast and crew, and the finale is a reprise of \"That's Entertainment!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Band Wagon still.JPG|thumb|right|Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the \"Girl Hunt Ballet\"]]\n[[File:The Band Wagon (1953) trailer 3.jpg|thumb|right|Finale, \"[[That's Entertainment (song)|That's Entertainment]]\" (reprise).
