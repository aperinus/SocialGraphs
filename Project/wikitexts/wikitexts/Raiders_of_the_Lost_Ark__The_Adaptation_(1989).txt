Using the original film's screenplay and score, it principally starred and was filmed, directed, and produced over a seven-year period by three [[Mississippi]] teenagers (Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb).\n\n==Plot==\n{{Further|Raiders of the Lost Ark#Plot}}\nSet in 1936, the film pits [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] (Strompolos) against a group of Nazis who are searching for the [[Ark of the Covenant]] which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible.\n\n==Cast==\nTaken from theraider.net:<ref name = raider/>\n* Chris Strompolos as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]\n* Angela Rodriguez as [[Marion Ravenwood]]\n* Eric Zala as [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Ren\u00e9 Belloq|Dr. Ren\u00e9 Belloq]]\n* Ted Ross as [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Toht|Arnold Toht]]\n* Alan Stenum as [[Sallah]]\n* William Coon as [[Marcus Brody]]\n\n==Production==\nShooting for the film began in 1982, when Strompolos, Zala and Lamb were only 12 years old, and continued over the next seven summers.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\">{{cite news | last = Windolf | first = Jim | title = Raiders of the Lost Backyard | newspaper = Vanity Fair | date = March 2004 | url = https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2004/03/raiders200403 | accessdate = April 18, 2012 }}</ref> It was made on a shoe-string budget of around $5000,<ref name = raider/> greatly contrasting with the original's $18 million budget. It was shot out of sequence, so due to its long filming period many actors randomly appear at different ages throughout the course of the film. As ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was not available on any home media format when they began filming, they were forced to collect all kinds of material about the film, including magazine articles, photographs, and even an illicit recording of the film's audio captured during a re-release screening of the original film in 1982.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\" /><ref name = \"raider making of\">{{cite web | title = ''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'' The Making Of | publisher = TheRaider.net | url = http://www.theraider.net/films/raiders_adaptation/pre_production.php | accessdate = April 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, members of the cast raised money on [[Kickstarter]]<ref name = \"KickStarter\">{{cite web | title = Raiders Guys and the Lost Airplane Scene | url = https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raidersguys/raiders-guys-and-the-lost-airplane-scene }}</ref> to re-unite and complete the film with the one scene they were not able to re-create as teenagers: the explosion of the [[flying wing]] aircraft.\n\n==Reception==\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'' was finally finished and premiered in 1989 at the auditorium of the local Coca-Cola plant in Gulfport, Mississippi. Later, the boys went their separate ways, going off to college, and the film was largely forgotten.<ref>{{cite news | last = Onstad | first = Katrina | title = Indy Spi | newspaper = CBC.ca | url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/photoessay/indyspirit/index.html | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}</ref> In 2002, [[Eli Roth]] (who had obtained a multi-generation dub of the film while in film school) gave a copy to [[Ain't It Cool News]]' [[Harry Knowles]], hoping that Knowles would screen it at that year's Butt-Numb-a-Thon film festival. When a late delivery for the premiere screening of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' led to a gap in the schedule, Knowles played the Adaptation to fill in time. It was so well received by the audience that when the film was stopped right before a popular action scene, the audience reportedly booed the ''Rings'' premiere, wanting to see the rest of the ''Raiders'' adaptation.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\" /> The film has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]] on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 9 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/raiders_of_the_lost_ark_the_adaptation|title = Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation}}</ref>\n\nWith the excitement from this partial screening, Roth tracked down Strompolos, Zala, and Lamb, and an official screening was held at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | last = Knowles | first = Harry | title = RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK shot-for-shot teenage remake review!!! | publisher = Ain't It Cool News | date = May 31, 2003 | url = https://www.aintitcool.com/node/15348 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}</ref> By this time, the film had also reached [[Steven Spielberg]], who wrote a letter to the filmmakers, calling the boys' achievement an inspiration.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hepola | first = Sarah | title = 'Lost Ark,' Resurrected | newspaper = Austin Chronicle | date = May 30, 2003 | url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2003-05-30/161565/ | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}</ref> Some time later, while the filmmakers were in Los Angeles promoting the film, Spielberg invited them to meet with him at his office.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair\" />\n\nSince the release of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation'', and despite its amateur status and the poor quality of the surviving copies, critics have generally praised the spirit and dedication of the filmmakers.
