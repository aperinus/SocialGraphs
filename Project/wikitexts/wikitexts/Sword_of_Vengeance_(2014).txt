Weedon's action sequences, and the overall look of the film, were inspired by [[samurai films]]. While the action sequences and Weber's performance were reasonably well received by critics, most felt the film's dialogue and overall story were subpar, with the caveat that aficionados of the genre would appreciate it far more.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn [[Northern England]], about 1089,<ref name=\"FiS\">{{cite web |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' (2013) |url=http://www.filminserbia.com/sword-of-vengeance-2013/ |website=Film in Serbia |publisher=[[Serbia Film Commission]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> some twenty years after the [[genocidal]] \"Harrowing\" (the [[Harrying of the North]] ordered by [[William the Conqueror]] to quell a series of rebellions), a former slave and [[Normans|Norman]] [[princeling]] has taken the name Shadow Walker ([[Stanley Weber]]) upon returning to his father's former lands. There the earl Durant ([[Karel Roden]]) rules as a [[despotism|despot]] with his equally cruel sons Lord Artus ([[Gianni Giardinelli]]) and Lord Romain ([[Edward Akrout]]).\n\nShadow Walker makes common cause with and rallies a large band of exiled rebel [[Anglo-Saxon]] farmers led by Anna ([[Annabelle Wallis]]). \nDurant is his treacherous uncle, who murdered his own brother and [[usurpation|usurped]] the power of the earldom, his nephew's [[hereditary title|birthright]]. One way or another, the question will be decided through battle.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Annabelle Wallis 2017.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Annabelle Wallis]] in 2017]]\n* [[Stanley Weber]] as Shadow Walker \n* [[Annabelle Wallis]] as Anna\n* [[Ed Skrein]] as Treden\n* [[Dave Legeno]] as Osgar \n* [[Karel Roden]] as Durant  \n* [[Edward Akrout]] as Romain\n* [[Gianni Giardinelli]] as Artus \n* Peter J.

Whereas the samurai films with their shorter swords lent themselves to... much faster and action orientated aspects in any given fight sequence... I was constantly looking for quick kills, sword slices that were hard and fast for the visual impact and to give us the energy and excitement of the battles as the heroes cut through cipher after cipher.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Production==\n''Sword of Vengeance'' was produced by [[Vertigo Films]] and Red Production, \"which has a long tradition of cooperation with foreign productions\".<ref name=\"FiS2\">{{cite web |title=Filming of the movie Sword of Vengeance completed today in Serbia |url=http://www.filminserbia.com/news/filming-of-the-movie-sword-of-vengeance-completed-today-in-serbia-2/ |website=Film in Serbia |publisher=Film in Serbia Commission |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Vertigo producer Huberta Von Liel noted that except for a few leading actors, the director, and the director of photography, everyone else involved, about 150 cast and crew, were from [[Serbia]].<ref name=\"FiS2\" />\n\n===Background===\nJim Weedon began his career as a film editor, and was encouraged to try directing by [[Ridley Scott]].<ref name=\"Sitges\">{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/film?id=10003528 |website=[[Sitges Film Festival]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> While ''Sword of Vengeance'' was his first feature film, this was \"after cutting his teeth editing music videos and television commercials.\"<ref name=\"Scheck\" /> He had won awards for his previous work.<ref name=\"Hunter\">{{cite web |last1=Hunter |first1=Allan |title=Sword Of Vengeance |url=https://www.screendaily.com/sword-of-vengeance/5078750.article |website=[[Screen Daily]] |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=17 October 2014}}</ref> Weedon was approached by Von Liel, who asked if he would be interested in making a period [[revenge]] drama: \"I was incredibly interested in the opportunity but also the fact that Vertigo Films allowed me total creative control visually.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n===Writing and characterisation===\nWhen Julian Unthank joined the project to develop the script, he and Weedon \"stripped back the dialogue to a minimum, something that was used a fair amount in the Spaghetti Westerns.\"<blockquote>We didn't want the film to fall into the standard cinematic tropes, although the script is a basic premise of revenge we wanted the story to unfold in more unexpected prose, especially the ending. I also wanted our hero to be an antihero, rather than the man that saves the day. His character although conflicted tries to atone for his sins but it comes too late, however, his absolution from Anna in the final scene allows him to find peace and solace from his chosen path of revenge.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Design===\nAesthetically, Weedon went for what he called a \"bleach bypass approach\" to [[colour grading|grading]] \"to achieve very little colour in the film.\" Wardrobe was designed to be \"muted,\" working with blues, greys and black; \"the only real colour coming through is the inherent hues from the fur that the heroes wore.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> The film's already low colour palette was accentuated by [[principal photography]] taking place in winter, as Jennie Kermode notes; everything appears dark, the sky a \"miserable grey,\" and the land \"hard and unyielding.\"<ref name=\"Kermode\">{{cite web |last1=Kermode |first1=Jennie |url=https://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/review/sword-of-vengeance-2015-film-review-by-jennie-kermode |title=''Sword Of Vengeance'' |website=eyeforfilm.co.uk |publisher=Eye For Film (UK) |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Weedon said he wanted the film to \"look and smell of the dark ages.\"<blockquote>Every aspect of the film from locations to clothing had to look worn, beaten and broken. I had shot some commercials in Serbia and found that they had very talented crew in all departments. Milos Djukelic had just co-produced ''Ironclad 2'' so was ahead in terms of the requirements we needed to create this harsh and foreboding world.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Filming and editing===\nLocation scouting took place in July 2013.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> ''Sword of Vengeance'' was filmed in thirty days in four locations in [[Serbia]].<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> These were the forest of Boj\u010dinska \u0160uma,<ref name=\"FiS\" /> in the [[Progar]] area of [[Belgrade]], as well as the fortress in [[Kalemegdan]], [[Deliblato]] and Pancevo Reva.<ref name=\"FiS2\" /> Weedon said he lost half a [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (seven [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]) the first four weeks into the shooting schedule, which was five to six days a week, in harsh weather, wading through mud every day, and later it snowed: \"days and nights were spent knee deep in mud that at dawn was dangerously frozen ice and by mid morning a muddy mass that was equally harsh.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" /> However, the most difficult part was actually the first two days:<blockquote>Ridiculously we decided to shoot the opening sequence which involved rain fx, horses, stunts, and prosthetics. It was the crew's first two days together, suddenly we are in the rain with actors who can't ride, horses that won't stand still, actors who are going into hyperthermia, and prosthetic limbs that refuse to come apart properly, add in stunts that could only be repeated three to four times, blood that wouldn't squirt sufficiently and the opening crane move into scene that kept breaking down. I did ask myself how the hell did I get into this mess.<ref name=\"Williams\" /></blockquote>\n\nWeedon described the editing of the film with Tom Boulding as \"incredibly fast\".<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n===Sound and music===\nWith so little dialogue in the film, it fell to the [[sound design]]er, Roland Heap, and the composer, [[Stephen Hilton]], to \"convey the unsaid.\" Weedon wanted the audience to have a \"musical roller-coaster ride\": \"Sound is integral to my commercial work and something that always creates the unexpected in the visuals.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe world premiere of ''Sword of Vengeance'' took place at the [[Sitges Film Festival]], where it was in competition, on 10 October 2014.<ref name=\"Sitges\" /> It had its Serbian premiere on 5 March 2015 at the [[FEST (Belgrade)|Belgrade International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |url=http://2015.fest.rs/Movies/1983/Sword-of-Vengeance.shtml |website=2015.fest.rs |publisher=FEST 43rd International Film Festival |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> The British theatrical release did not follow until 29 May.<ref name=\"IMDb\" />\n\n===Home media and streaming===\n''Sword of Vengeance'' has been available on DVD and DVD/Blu-ray (Well Go USA Entertainment,<ref name=\"RT\" /> [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword Of Vengeance [Blu-ray + DVD] |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Sword-Vengeance-Blu-ray-Stanley-Webber/dp/B00V72RPLM |website=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> and streaming services ([[Google Play]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Sword_of_Vengeance?gl=no&hl=en&id=TXDQtbnE8ng |website=[[Google Play]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> [[iTunes]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://itunes.apple.com/jo/movie/sword-of-vengeance/id1005046805 |website=[[iTunes]] |publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]] |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> [[Hulu]])<ref>{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Brett |title=What's Streaming on Netflix Tonight: 'Acts of Vengeance' + More |url=https://decider.com/2018/01/25/new-on-netflix-acts-of-vengeance/ |website=Decider |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> since May 2015.\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:Stanley Weber 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Stanley Weber]] in 2018]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] assigns ''Sword of Vengeance'' a rating of 13% based on eight reviews.<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sword_of_vengeance |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Critics gave faint to fair praise to the fight scenes, and to [[Stanley Weber]]'s performance, but found the film wanting otherwise, though acknowledging at the same time that the fighting sequences would be enjoyed by action film fans.\n\nAllan Hunter's review following the world premiere at Sitges set the tone for critics into 2015:<blockquote>The only things that appear to be lacking is an original story and some decent dialogue... Stanley Weber's Shadow Walker is very much in the Eastwood tradition down to the squint in his eye and the poncho-like garment draped over his strapping shoulders. He is a man with no name but a remarkably good hair stylist to maintain those immaculate cornrows... The plot is pretty basic but served up with some style by Weedon... His vision of England is bleak, oppressive and uniformly monochrome.  It sometimes seems as if the only colour in the palette of cinematographer August Jakobsson is the crimson of fresh blood. There is a good deal of blood though as limbs are hacked off, throats are slit and eyes plucked out with merry abandon.  Weedon keeps it tight and spare but the real drawbacks are the weary plotting and cheesy dialogue.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /></blockquote>\n\nFrank Scheck, writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', opines that the title \"pretty much says it all\": there are \"enough clanging sword fights, severed limbs, slit throats and bare-bones dialogue to satisfy genre fans while pretty much failing to provide something of interest to anyone else\"; the film, while \"admirably stylish\", has the feel of an 11th century-set [[video game]]. Stanley Weber stands out among the cast, \"even managing to make such declarations as \"Vengeance is my only belief\" sound convincing.\"<ref name=\"Scheck\" /> Josh Oakley complains that the dialogue is \"overwrought and bland, with the actors apparently instructed to take long pauses between each line\" and \"much of the cast\" seem to have accents like [[Tommy Wiseau]]'s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oakley |first1=Josh |title=\"It is he who brings them hope.\" |url=http://cutprintfilm.com/reviews/sword-of-vengeance/ |website=CutPrintFilm |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=17 March 2015}}</ref> Ernest Hardy of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said the film \"hits its mark of being a popcorn action flick just fine.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Sword of Vengeance |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sword-of-vengeance |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nJames Luxford of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' said there is a \"brutal simplicity to the action that will appeal to some,\" but otherwise, ''Sword of Vengeance'' \"seems stretched even for a relatively short film.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luxford |first1=James |title=''Sword of Vengeance'' |journal=[[Radio Times]] |date=May 28, 2015 |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/dhgf5q/sword-of-vengeance/ |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref> Jennie Kermode assigned the film 2 stars out of 5, saying the fight scenes were uneven but: \"Weber's work is carefully choreographed and will please fans of fighting films even if it does sometimes take liberties with physics. This is important because there really isn't much else in the film at all.\"<ref name=\"Kermode\" /> Geoffrey Macnab of ''[[The Independent]]'' agreed: \"The ritualised action sequences work well enough.
