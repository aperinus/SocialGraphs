With the success of ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'' in the same year, Burton began to consider developing ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' as either a [[short film]] or a half-hour television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project and in 1990, he made a development deal with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. Production started in July 1991 in [[San Francisco]]; Disney initially released the film through [[Touchstone Pictures]] because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".<ref name=Forbes20th/>\n\nThe film met with both critical and commercial success, earning praise for its animation (particularly the innovation of the stop-motion art form), characters, songs and score. It has grossed $91.5 million worldwide since its initial release and garnered a [[cult following]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], a first for an animated film, but lost to ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref name=\"GoodNightOscars\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/109919042/jurassic-park-another-spielberg/ |title='Jurassic Park,' another Spielberg movie, also has good night with 3 awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220921024558/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/109919042/jurassic-park-another-spielberg/ |date=March 22, 1994 |access-date=September 21, 2022 |archive-date=September 21, 2022 |page=6 |publisher=[[The Orlando Sentinel]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-status=live}} {{Open access}}</ref> The film has since been [[reissue]]d by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], and was re-released annually in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] from 2006 until 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Halloween]] Town is a [[fantasy world]] populated by various [[monster]]s and beings associated with the holiday. [[Jack Skellington]], respected by the citizens as the \"Pumpkin King\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, this year, Jack has grown tired of the same annual routine and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the next morning, he encounters six trees containing doors leading to other holiday-themed worlds and stumbles into the one leading to [[Christmas]] Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns home to show his friends and neighbors his findings, but unaware of the idea of Christmas, they compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. However, they do relate to one Christmas Town character: its ruler, [[Santa Claus]], or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly calls him. Jack sequesters himself in his house to study Christmas further and find a way to rationally explain it. After studying and experimentation accomplish nothing, Jack ultimately decides that Christmas should be improved rather than understood and announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.\n\nJack assigns the residents many Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal [[reindeer]]. Sally, a feminine creation of local [[mad scientist]] Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] detailing that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses this and assigns her the task of making him a Santa Claus suit. He also tasks mischievous [[trick-or-treating]] trio Lock, Shock and Barrel to abduct Santa and bring him to Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be handling Christmas in his place this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but against his wishes, they deliver Santa to Jack's long-time rival, Oogie Boogie, a [[bogeyman]] with a passion for [[gambling]] who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa to save both him and Jack from their potential fates, but she is captured as well.\n\nJack departs to deliver his presents in the real world, but they instead frighten the populace, who contact the authorities and are instructed by them to lock down their homes and residences for protection. When word spreads about Jack's presumed wrongdoings, he is ultimately shot down by [[military]] forces, causing him to crash in a cemetery. While all of Halloween Town sadly believe him to be dead, Jack actually survived. As he bemoans the disaster he has caused, he finds he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love of Halloween, but soon realizes he must act fast to fix his mess. Jack returns home and infiltrates Oogie's lair, rescuing Santa and Sally before confronting Oogie and defeating him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all the [[insect|bugs]] inside him to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions, to which he, despite being furious at Jack for the trouble he caused and not heeding Sally's forewarnings, assures him that he can still save Christmas. As Santa replaces Jack's presents with genuine ones, all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's survival and return. Santa then shows Jack that there are no hard feelings between them by bringing a snowfall to the town, which fulfills Jack's original dream in a way and causes the residents to finally realize the true meaning of Christmas. Afterwards, Jack and Sally declare their love for each other.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}} \n{{Main|List of The Nightmare Before Christmas characters}}\n{{multiple image\n | caption_align = center\n | footer    = The voices for [[Jack Skellington]]'s spoken lines and [[List of The Nightmare Before Christmas characters#Sally|Sally]] were respectively provided by Sarandon and O'Hara.\n | image1    = Chris Sarandon July 2017.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = [[Chris Sarandon]] (2017)\n | total_width = 350\n | image2    = CATHERINE OHARA.jpg\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = [[Catherine O'Hara]] (2005)\n}}\n*[[Chris Sarandon]] (speaking voice) and [[Danny Elfman]] (singing voice) as [[Jack Skellington]], a skeleton known as the \"Pumpkin King\" of Halloween Town.
