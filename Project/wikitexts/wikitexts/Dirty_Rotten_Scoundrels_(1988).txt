The screenplay was written by [[Dale Launer]], [[Stanley Shapiro]], and [[Paul Henning]]. It is a remake of the 1964 [[Marlon Brando]]/[[David Niven]] film ''[[Bedtime Story (1964 film)|Bedtime Story]]'', also written by Shapiro and Henning, and was later remade in 2019 as ''[[The Hustle (film)|The Hustle]]'', starring [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Rebel Wilson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\nThe film tells the story of two [[Confidence trick|con men]] competing to swindle an heiress out of $50,000. Caine plays educated and suave Lawrence Jamieson, who stages elaborate ruses to bilk rich women, while Martin plays his less refined, small-time rival, Freddy Benson. It takes place on the [[French Riviera]]. The film was released on December 14, 1988 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nLawrence Jamieson is an intelligent and sophisticated British [[con artist]] operating in [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer|Beaumont-sur-Mer]] on the [[French Riviera]]. With the help of manservant Arthur and amoral police official Andre, he seduces wealthy women and cons them out of money by posing as a prince in exile trying to raise money for his country's \"freedom fighters.\" His only concern is another con artist known as \"The Jackal\" who has been reported in the area.\n\nWhile on a train, Lawrence crosses paths with small-time American hustler Freddy Benson, who brags about his meager accomplishments at conning rich women out of money with a sob story about a sick grandmother. Worried that Freddy's inexperienced antics will scare away his prey, Lawrence attempts to trick Freddy into choosing a different destination, then has him arrested and put on a plane out of town. However, after Freddy meets one of Lawrence's former marks, he blackmails Lawrence into taking him on as a pupil.\n\nLawrence attempts to teach Freddy style and refinement, with limited success. He then involves Freddy in his cons, playing his mentally challenged brother Ruprecht to scare away women Lawrence has seduced (and now, in the new con, proposed to). When Lawrence refuses to give Freddy a cut of the profits, Freddy angrily quits but refuses to leave town.\n\nLawrence is unwilling to share his territory with Freddy, so the two agree on a bet: the first to con $50,000 out of a selected [[Victimology|mark]] wins, and the other must leave town. They target new arrival Janet Colgate, the na\u00efve \"United States Soap Queen\". Freddy poses as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatically]] crippled U.S. Navy veteran who needs $50,000 for treatment by the celebrated [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Emil Schaffhausen of [[Liechtenstein]]. When Janet shows sympathy to Freddy, Lawrence poses as Dr. Schaffhausen and agrees to treat Freddy but stipulates that Janet pay the $50,000 fee directly to him.\n\nLawrence discovers that Janet is not actually a soap heiress, having won her vacation and \"Soap Queen\" title in a [[sweepstakes]]; nevertheless, she plans to liquidate most of her assets to pay for Freddy's treatment. Lawrence attempts to call off the bet, as he only cons wealthy marks. Freddy counters with a new bet: Janet herself, with the first in bed with her declared the winner. Lawrence is disgusted and refuses to seduce Janet, but agrees that should Freddy fail with Janet, he wins.\n\nUnder the guise of continuing Freddy's treatment, Lawrence dances with Janet and taunts Freddy, raising the ire of some nearby British sailors, whom Freddy convinces to waylay Lawrence. He rushes to Janet's hotel room, where he demonstrates his love by standing and walking to her. However, Lawrence has secretly been present the whole time and declares Freddy cured. Ushering Freddy out of the room, he explains that the sailors released him after discovering that he is a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] officer. Lawrence puts Janet on a departing plane and leaves the sailors with Freddy, who realizes that he lost the bet, but enjoys the merry drinking with them.\n\nHowever, Janet instead returns to her hotel room and finds Freddy there. She declares her love for him, and they kiss and begin undressing. Andre reports this to Lawrence, who accepts his defeat with grace. He waits for Freddy to return and gloat over his victory, but instead Janet arrives in tears and says that Freddy stole the money her father sent. Disgusted, Lawrence calls Andre to have Freddy arrested, gives Janet a bag containing $50,000 of his own money, and takes her to the airport.\n\nBefore her plane departs, Janet returns Lawrence's bag, refusing to take what isn't hers. Andre arrives with Freddy, who claims that Janet stole his wallet and clothes. Lawrence disbelieves him, pointing out Janet's honesty in returning the $50,000. Opening his bag, he finds that the money has been replaced with Freddy's clothes and a note wherein Janet reveals herself to be the Jackal. Freddy is furious, while Lawrence is impressed.\n\nThe following week, Freddy and Lawrence contemplate their loss at Lawrence's villa. They are about to part ways when Janet, posing as a New York City real estate agent, arrives in a yacht filled with wealthy people. She prompts the shocked Lawrence and Freddy to assume roles in her scheme and, after sending her guests off to refresh themselves, takes the pair aside and announces that while she made three million dollars the previous year, \"[their] fifty thousand was the most fun.\" Joining arms, they set out to fleece their latest victims.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Freddy Benson\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Lawrence Jamieson\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Janet Colgate\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] as Inspector Andre\n* [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Fanny Eubanks\n* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as Arthur\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Mrs. Reed\n* [[Meagen Fay]] as Miss Trumble\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Diana\n* [[Louis Zorich]] as Nikos, the Greek millionaire\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{Anchor|History}}The original 1964 film titled ''[[Bedtime Story (1964 film)|Bedtime Story]]'' was written as a [[star vehicle|vehicle]] for [[Doris Day]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rock Hudson]]. It was eventually made with [[Shirley Jones]], [[David Niven]] and [[Marlon Brando]].\n\nThe 1988 version similarly underwent casting changes. It started as a possible vehicle for [[Mick Jagger]] and [[David Bowie]], who approached [[Dale Launer]] to write a screenplay for them. Launer suggested a remake of ''Bedtime Story''. Launer acquired the rights for the remake, but Bowie and Jagger dropped out to do a movie with [[Martin Scorsese]]. According to Bowie, they were \"a bit tweezed that we lost out on a script that could have been reasonably good.\"<ref name=Movieline92>{{Citation | last=Campbell | first=Virginia | title=Bowie at the Bijou | journal=Movieline | volume=III | issue=7 | year=1992 | pages=83}}</ref> According to [[The Awl|Splitsider]], [[Eddie Murphy]] was considered for the role of Freddy Benson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Eddie Murphy|date=7 April 2011|publisher=[[The Awl|Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/04/the-lost-roles-of-eddie-murphy/|access-date=18 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723072044/http://splitsider.com/2011/04/the-lost-roles-of-eddie-murphy/|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[John Cleese]] was also approached for the role of Jamieson, but declined.

Palin wrote that he then received a phone call from [[Frank Oz]] on April 1, 1988, asking him to consider the part of Jamieson. Palin flew to New York City from London a few days later to read for the role, but was not sure of his own suitability for the part.\n\n[[Richard Dreyfuss]] was also sent a script. Though he was intended for the part of Benson, a misunderstanding resulted in him preparing the part of Jamieson, so [[Steve Martin]] (who conversely had also been asked to play Jamieson) read Benson's part instead. Oz was excited by Martin's version of Benson, and settled on this choice. [[Michael Caine]] was eventually chosen to play Jamieson. Palin wrote in his diary that Caine was \"probably the nearest he (Oz) will get in an English actor to the effortless charisma of Niven.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Palin |first=Michael |date=2009 |title=Michael Palin Diaries 1980-1988 Halfway to Hollywood |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312682026/page/560 560\u2013565] |isbn=978-0-312-68202-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312682026/page/560 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cap-Ferrat - Avenue de la Corniche - View NNW on Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat.jpg|thumb|Several scenes were filmed at the [[Grand-H\u00f4tel du Cap-Ferrat]]]]\nProduction of the film began on June 6, 1988 and lasted through early August, finishing \"six days ahead of schedule.\"<ref name=AFI2022>{{cite web |url= https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55753 |title= Catalog - Dirty Rotten Scoundrels |website= [[American Film Institute]] |access-date= April 28, 2022}}</ref> Filming locations included [[Antibes]], [[Cannes]], [[Beaulieu-sur-Mer]] (depicted in the film as \"Beaumont-sur-Mer\"), [[Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat]], [[Nice]] and [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]].
