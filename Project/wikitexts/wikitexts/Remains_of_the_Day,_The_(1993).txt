The film was directed by [[James Ivory]], produced by [[Ismail Merchant]], [[Mike Nichols]], and [[John Calley]] and adapted by [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]]. It stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as James Stevens and [[Emma Thompson]] as Miss Kenton, with [[James Fox]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Hugh Grant]], [[Ben Chaplin]], and [[Lena Headey]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was a critical and box office success and it was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Thompson) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Jhabvala). In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''The Remains of the Day'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|64th-greatest British film of the 20th century]].<ref>[http://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films''] (1999). Retrieved August 27, 2016</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958 in [[postwar Britain]], Stevens, the [[butler]] of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from the recently-separated Miss Kenton, a [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] two decades ago. Their former employer, the [[Earl of Darlington#In fiction|Earl of Darlington]], has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his prewar support of Germany. He was labelled a traitor and [[Nazi]] sympathiser although his position was shared by many others in the mid-1930s. His stately country house was sold to retired [[US Congressman]] Jack Lewis. Allowed to borrow the [[Daimler Company#Lanchester acquisition and badging|Daimler]], Stevens sets off to the [[West Country]] to try to persuade Miss Kenton to return as housekeeper.\n\nA flashback shows Kenton's arrival as housekeeper in the 1930s. The ever-efficient Stevens manages the household well and prides in and derives his entire identity from his profession. Miss Kenton, equally invaluable, efficient and strong-willed, is warmer and less repressed. They occasionally butt heads, particularly over Stevens's father, now an under-butler,  who is failing and no longer able to perform his duties, which Stevens refuses to see. He displays total professionalism by carrying on as his father lies dying.\n\nRelations between Stevens and Kenton eventually thaw, and she clearly shows her feelings. Despite their proximity, Stevens outwardly remains detached since he is dedicated solely as Lord Darlington's butler. Greatly repressed, Stevens is caught reading a [[romance novel]] by Kenton, which he explains is to improve his vocabulary, and he asks her not to invade his privacy again.\n\nMeanwhile, Darlington Hall is often frequented by politicians, most of whom are like-minded, [[fascist]]-sympathising British and European aristocrats, with the exception of Congressman Lewis, who disagrees with Lord Darlington and his guests. Calling the \"gentleman politicians\" meddling amateurs, he says that \"Europe has become the arena of [[Realpolitik]]\" and warns them of an impending disaster. Later, the aristocratic guest Spencer directs a series of political and economic questions to Stevens, who fails to answer. Spencer claims that shows the lower classes' ignorance and lack of worthy opinions, noting \"[[Q.E.D.]]\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and German ambassador [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] meet, seeking [[appeasement]] and peace for [[Nazi Germany]]. In the midst of those events, and after exposure to [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial laws]], Darlington suddenly tells Stevens to dismiss the two newly appointed, refugee [[German-Jewish]] maids, despite his protest. Kenton threatens to resign if he does so but later confesses that she cannot as she has no family and nowhere to go. She believes that he did not care about the girls' fate. When later, Lord Darlington feels regret and wants to rehire the maids, neither Stevens nor Miss Kenton can locate them.\n\nLord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, is appalled by the secret meetings in Darlington Hall. Concurring with Congressman Lewis's earlier protests, he tells Stevens that his godfather is being used by the Nazis. Despite Cardinal's indignation, Stevens does not denounce or criticise his master, since he feels that it is not his place to judge him.\n\nEventually, Kenton forms a relationship with a former co-worker, Tom Benn, who proposes and asks her to run a coastal [[boarding house]] with him. Kenton tells Stevens as an ultimatum, but he will not admit his feelings and only offers his congratulations. Finding her crying, his only response is to call her attention to a neglected domestic task. She leaves Darlington Hall prior to the start of the [[Second World War]].\n\nEn route to meeting Kenton in 1958 in the Daimler, Stevens is mistaken for gentry by locals in a pub but chooses not to correct them. Doctor Carlisle, a local GP, speaks with him and realises that he is likely a manservant, but he says nothing. Promising to bring fuel the next morning to Stevens's car, he arrives with it, and correctly establishes Stevens's identity. Stevens explains his dilemma in the bar, and Carlisle, who is fascinated, asks Stevens what he thought about Lord Darlington's actions. At first denying having even met him, he later admits to having served and respected him. He states that it was not his place to either approve or disapprove, as he was merely a butler. He, however, confirms that Darlington admitted that his Nazi sympathies were misguided and he had been too naive. Lord Darlington was unable to correct his terrible error, but he was now en route to correct his own.\n\nHe meets Kenton (though separated, she is still Mrs. Benn), and they reminisce. Stevens mentions that Lord Darlington's godson, Reginald Cardinal, was killed in the war. He also says that Lord Darlington died from a broken heart after the war after he had attempted to sue a newspaper for [[libel]], losing the suit and his reputation.\n\nMiss Kenton declines the offer to return to Darlington Hall, as she wishes to remain near her pregnant grown daughter. She may go back to her husband, because, despite being unhappy for many years, he needs her. As they part, they are both quietly upset, Miss Kenton visibly tearful as her bus pulls away. Back at Darlington Hall, Lewis asks Stevens if he remembers much of the old days, and Stevens replies that he was too busy serving. A pigeon then becomes trapped in the hall and is eventually freed by them both, flying away with Stevens and Darlington Hall far behind.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Mr James Stevens\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Miss Sarah \"Sally\" Kenton (later Mrs Benn)\n* [[James Fox]] as the [[Earl of Darlington#In fiction|Earl of Darlington]] (Lord Darlington)\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Congressman]] Jack Lewis\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Mr William Stevens (\"Mr Stevens, Sr\")\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Reginald Cardinal (Lord Darlington's [[godson]])\n* [[John Haycraft]] as Auctioneer\n* Caroline Hunt as Landlady\n* [[Michael Lonsdale]] as Dupont d'Ivry\n* [[Jeffry Wickham]] as [[Viscount]] Bigge\n* [[Paula Jacobs]] as Mrs Mortimer\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Charlie\n* Steve Dibben as George (footman no. 2)\n* Abigail Harrison as Housemaid\n* [[Rupert Vansittart]] as [[Sir]] Geoffrey Wren\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as Spencer\n* [[Peter Halliday]] as [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Tufnell\n* [[Peter Cellier]] as Sir Leonard Bax\n* Frank Shelley as [[Neville Chamberlain|Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain]]\n* [[Peter Eyre]] as the [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|3rd Viscount Halifax]] (Lord Halifax)\n* [[Terence Bayler]] as Trimmer\n* Hugh Sweetman as [[hall boy|Scullery Boy]]\n* [[Tony Aitken]] as Postmaster\n* Emma Lewis as Elsa\n* Joanna Joseph as Irma\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Tom Benn\n* [[John Savident]] as Doctor Meredith\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Lizzie\n* [[Paul Copley]] as Harry Smith\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Doctor Carlisle\n* [[Brigitte Kahn]] as a German ''[[Freifrau]]'' ([[Baroness]])\n* [[Wolf Kahler]] as German ambassador [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]\n* [[Jo Kendall]] as Publican's wife\n* [[Ian Redford (actor)|Ian Redford]] as Publican\n* [[Miles Richardson]] as Craddock (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nA film adaptation of the novel was originally planned to be directed by [[Mike Nichols]] from a script by [[Harold Pinter]]. Some of Pinter's script was used in the film, but, while Pinter was paid for his work, he asked to have his name removed from the credits, in keeping with his contract.{{efn|group=notes|name=Gale|\n\"In November 1994, Pinter wrote, \"I've just heard that they are bringing another writer into the \"''[[Lolita (1997 film)|Lolita]]''\" film. It doesn't surprise me.' ... Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (which is exactly the case with <nowiki>[</nowiki>the film<nowiki>]</nowiki> ''The Remains of the Day''-he had insisted on this clause since the bad experience with revisions made to his ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|Handmaid's Tale]]'' script); he has never been given any reason as to why another writer was brought in\" (Gale 352).\n}} Christopher C. Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which he has decided not to publish. When his script for ''The Remains of the Day'' was radically revised by the [[James Ivory]]\u2013[[Ismail Merchant]] partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\" (125).{{efn|group=notes|name=Hudgins|\nHudgins adds:  \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's ''Lolita'' finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 <nowiki>[</nowiki>1995<nowiki>]</nowiki> letter <nowiki>[</nowiki>to Hudgins<nowiki>]</nowiki> to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the ''Remains of the Day'' situation\" (125).}}{{efn|group=notes|name=Jones|[[Cf.]] the essay on the film ''The Remains of the Day'' published in Gale's collection by Edward T. Jones: \"Pinter gave me a copy of his typescript for his screenplay, which he revised 24 January 1991, during an interview that I conducted with him in London about his screenplay in May 1992, part of which appeared in 'Harold Pinter: A Conversation' in ''Literature/Film Quarterly'', XXI (1993): 2\u20139. In that interview, Pinter mentioned that Ishiguro liked the screenplay that he had scripted for a proposed film version of the novel. All references to Pinter's screenplay in the text <nowiki>[</nowiki>of Jones's essay<nowiki>]</nowiki> are to this unpublished manuscript\" (107n1).\n}}{{efn|group=notes|name=2008essay|\nIn his 2008 essay published in ''The Pinter Review'', Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed film scripts, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', ''The Remains of the Day'' and ''Lolita'',\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful film scripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter film scripts are now available not only in private collections but also in the [[Harold Pinter Archive|Pinter Archive]] at the [[British Library]]\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished film scripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).\n}} Though no longer the director, Nichols remained associated with the project as one of its producers.\n\nThe music was recorded at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in [[Dublin]].\n\n===Settings===\n[[File:Powderham Castle Music Room 02.jpg|thumb|250px|Music Room of Powderham Castle in 1983]]A number of [[English country house|English country estates]] were used as locations for the film, partly owing to the persuasive power of Ismail Merchant, who was able to cajole permission for the production to borrow houses not normally open to the public. Among them were [[Dyrham Park]] for the exterior of the house and the driveway, [[Powderham Castle]] (staircase, hall, music room, bedroom; used for the aqua-turquoise stairway scenes), [[Corsham Court]] (library and dining room) and [[Badminton House]] (servants' quarters, conservatory, entrance hall). [[Luciana Arrighi]], the production designer, scouted most of these locations. Scenes were also shot in [[Weston-super-Mare]], which stood in for [[Clevedon]]. The pub where Mr Stevens stays is the Hop Pole in [[Limpley Stoke]]; the shop featured is also in Limpley Stoke.
